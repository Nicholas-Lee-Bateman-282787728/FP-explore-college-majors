7275757,5,B00ZCHTR6O,One of the best animated films I've ever seen. A great movie for all Naruto fans to watch and own. It's definently a must see.,1436918400,29,126,4.08
7275758,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"This is by far my favorite Naruto movie out of them all. It has comedy, action, and brings a new serious side to Naruto that we've never seen in the manga/anime. The real Naruto fans wouldn't be shaken by this ""shipping wars"" or whatever it's called. None of us started to read/watch Naruto to see who he ends up with, cause if that's the case, go read/watch a shojo. So stop with the bull crap all because he didn't end up with the one you wanted.",1436918400,17,448,4.22093023255814
7275759,5,B00ZCHTR6O,Naruto and Hinata have become more than just friends in this movie if you idiots can't see it that way if you guys don't like English then stop acting like jerks and stuff acting people that start seeing what this movie was really about,1436918400,6,236,4.386363636363637
7275760,1,B00ZCHTR6O,I was thoroughly disappointed with Naruto after I saw how it ends. The manga is lackluster. I would not buy this.,1436832000,9,113,4.428571428571429
7275761,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"A beautiful Last movie. But don't despair, Naruto also continues in Shonen Jump - The 7th Hokage & the Scarlet Spring. Thank you Kishimoto-sensei!

7275764,5,B00ZCHTR6O,This is a great wrap-up to the 700+ episodes in Naruto and Naruto Shippuden! And it has a couple of plots... How Naruto chases the girl until she catches him!,1523232000,,158,4.3
7275765,4,B00ZCHTR6O,Story about how Naruto finally falls for Hinata. Had enough action to keep me entertained. Still wondering why Hinata couldn't use chakra to stick to the side of that building instead of falling. Little Nick Pick,1521072000,,212,4.916666666666667
7275766,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"Before I bought this movie I had watched it like 30 times on youtube. This movie had me in tears, it was what I was waiting for for years, as a fan of Naruto I could tell that Hinata and Naruto were meant to be together, but you just never knew what Kishimoto had in plans for who was marrying who. Very satisfied with the purchase of this movie.",1520121600,,346,4.028985507246377

7275769,4,B00ZCHTR6O,"So, there's some bad guy who wants to destroy all life on earth, you know, because. He kidnaps Hinata's younger sister, Hanabi, and it's up to Naruto and crew to rescue her. Oh, and stop the bad guy from doing bad guy things. The main draw for this movie is the payoff of Naruto and Hinata finally becoming an item (Not sure how canon this movie is but it does serve as a nice prequel to the final episodes of the Naruto Shippuden series). The movie itself is okay. The animation is fine and the plot is serviceable. The film slows down in the middle section but picks up the pace in the climax. The villain is laughable. He's one dimentional and embarrassingly weak. After every powerful foe Naruto has fought against, this guy is just a minor road block. There are some cameos from various characters from the series, no matter how shoehorned in they may be at times, it is a nice touch.

This is one of the better Naruto films and is well worth a watch if you're interested in this kind of anime.",1516752000,,999,4.342245989304812
7275770,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"The Last: Naruto the Movie is a manga and anime series. Two years after the Fourth Ninja World War and Kakashi Hatake becomes the Sixth Hokage, the moon is falling towards Earth and will soon collide. The crisis is caused by Toneri tsutsuki, a descendant of Hamura tsutsuki of the Branch House, who is determined to fulfill his legacy and punish mankind for abusing chakra over a millennia. During the Rinne Festival, as Hinata Hyuga knits a red scarf that Naruto Uzumaki wore when they first met, Sakura offers to help her, but Hinata becomes doubtful as Naruto receives various gifts from everyone, including another scarf. Toneri infiltrates the Leaf Village but fails to kidnap Hinata due to Naruto's intervention, though Toneri successfully kidnaps Hanabi, Hinata's younger sister.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1-Angel-cat-Angelcat-book-of-beginning/dp/1466322527/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1: Angel cat: Angelcat  book  of  beginning</a>",1515024000,,983,6.160583941605839

7275818,1,B00ZCHTR6O,"What a disappointment.  For the Hinata fans out there, this was the movie you are going to really like or really hate.  Everything felt rushed and forced in just to build the setup for the Boruto movie, Naruto and Hinata's son.  ""They are rebooting Sailor moon, Dragonball, etc... We need a new next gen movie for Naruto!"", someone in the production office proclaimed.  To make that happen, all that Hinata went through to become a strong, confident woman were all discarded.  She regressed back to her childlike self full with doubts and insecurities while needing rescued by Naruto at least twice.  Really?  Have we not gone past the damsel in distress era?  Is that the only way to portray their love?  Her strength as a powerful ninja who masters the ability to stop chakra flow (you know, the powerful energy ninjas use from fighting to healing) was treated as a complete joke as it is implied that she is so WEAK, she can't even destroy, much less make a dent, on the ONE thing she was only able to do to save the world.  Again, to do so, she needed Naruto's aid.  So here we are, in 2015, Hinata's development went to the crappers.

There was so much anticipation to see how Naruto will react to Hinata's love confession.  His response was simply unrealistic and more so as reciprocating same just because the movie said so.  Not once throughout the movie, has he explained WHY and WHEN he fell in love with her.  He didn't seem to notice her until being told to by others.  He showed more love towards eating RAMEN than to Hinata in the entire series and past movies.  It takes more than a short 2 minute montage of them looking for Hanabi, drinking some water and putting ointment on his back to build ""forever"" feelings toward someone he neglected over a decade.  Seriously, what kind of relationship is this?

You keep knitting that scarf, Hinata.  That is one thing that you are at least good at in this movie.  And from the looks of Boruto the movie, that's the doormat/house wife role they plan to keep you in.",1480204800,,2024,4.535911602209945

7275820,5,B00ZCHTR6O,Love it!,1478649600,,8,3.5
7275821,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"Good movie overall.  Good blu-ray.  Good mix to the Japanese soundtrack.  Naruto and Hinata are kind of like Harry and Ginny to me (in terms of: the author decided that they were going to get together when they started the story-regardless of how the story evolved along the way that mayyyybe should have pointed them in different directions?) but I was begrudgingly on board by the time the movie ended, lol.

One note: the short film of the day Naruto becomes Hokage is NOT on the blu-ray.  Just FYI there.  I had read that they showed it with the film in theaters and thought it would be on the blu-ray.",1478563200,5,606,4.463636363636364

It feels the gap between shippuden and boruto and....don't wanna spoil it for people who haven't finished the manga but a must own for any naruto fan,1475971200,3,405,4.486486486486487

Hinata was always my favorite character on the show and seeing her finally realize her love for Naruto, and Naruto stop being an idiot long enough to realize he loves her too, was just so heart warming! The shy little girl from the bible family and the orphan ""fox kid"" finally together!

7275834,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"Full disclosure: I've been a huge NaruHina fan almost from the start of when I began watching Naruto so I acknowledge my bias, but that's okay because most people who plan to watch this movie will at least kind of like the NaruHina ship.

I loved this movie mostly for two reasons:

1) I was pleasantly surprised that Kishimoto decided to make this movie at all because he has said he feels embarrassed to write romance stories and yet here it is! It still has all the usual action of a Naruto episode but with the strong romance element, it becomes a great hybrid movie of action/romance. My wife doesn't know that much about the Naruto series and yet even she enjoyed watching it with me because of this!

2) Hinata is my favorite female character of the series regardless of the shipping aspect and it was nice to see her get more screen time and work together with Naruto in some scenes. She's still far from being the strongest but she still demonstrates that she's gotten stronger (she's able to fight more effectively against people that her Father was unable to take care of at the beginning of the movie) and even assist Naruto when he was incapable of destroying something himself.

You too will love the movie if you're a into NaruHina stuff, but I predict you'll still like it anyway even if you are indifferent to the pairing aspect.",1470960000,4,1346,4.549586776859504

My bluray combo didn't come in a sleeve with the cover you see in the pictures of the movie description, it was only the orange cover with Naruto in the center.

7275880,2,B00ZCHTR6O,"All-right, and I honestly thought ""Bonds"" was rather awful, with it's paint-by numbers story of ""oh that's actually a girl"" ""this old guy is pulling some stuff"" (we've seen this like 5 times already), and cop-out easy to solve invasion ending. Having been off the tails of Blood Prison and Road To Ninja, I'm still not even sure what I forced myself to sit through with this one. People say ""Lost Tower"" wasn't good, with the time traveling and Naruto actually meeting his father and stuff. Ok, enough prior Naruto film comparison.

This is, without the doubt, the worst Naruto movie to date. It's not even a paint-by-numbers issue. It literally makes zero sense. OK, I can handle them showcasing Hinata some in a plot-line, and having a little fun with her obvious ""I have always loved you"" thing for Naruto. But seriously, he never even acknowledged in all the years passed he even remotely liked her. There not even close. OK, I get it, Sakura is obsessed with Sasuke. But seriously. He lost his mind. It would've been more believable if she'd abandoned everything to be with him, then to believe that Naruto suddenly decides to play ""oh i can get the girls!"" This turns into a soap-opera/love story rather than shonen anime somewhere within the time frame of this film. They couldn't even have Sakura be a bit jealous of the Hinato-Naruto set up here, given her obvious close bond to Naruto? It's like they were not even trying to make sense, but just be like ""ship these two and make a plotline around it!"" There were better filler arcs in the series than this.
Nevermind the fact that, like Bonds, this movie really didn't go anything to ackowledge itself as a ""great story"" of a film, unlike Road to Ninja, Blood Prison, Will Of Fire, the 1st Shippuden movie, the original 3 Naruto movies. etc. Even if they were like filler story arcs made into better animated feature length films, they were still trying hard to make us pay attention. Just for example, that gate thing in Blood Prison was really creepy, something feared by even chief toad. This movie has nothing whatsoever but the forced love story to hold it. Hinata's clan and past becomes an explosion of trouble and they have to take on another villain whose playing the ""This is my right this is what is going to happen!"" thing. I honestly cannot comprehend what anyone was thinking.
And then they made a sequel to this where Sakura and Sasuke are together...after all the damage he caused? Seriously? Sakura practically has Stockholm syndrome minus the actually being held captive part at this point. She was always way stronger than that.

Now I am not saying ""she should've ended up with Naruto"" 100%. Would it have made a lot more sense? Yes. Would it have felt far less forced? Definitely. Am I on that shipping team? Nope. It's not necessary for every character to get paired up with a lover. Especially on a show that acknowledges friendship bonds constantly as it's primarily focus of importance when it comes to character interaction. And that, is all one really needs to think about to judge this film. If you really wanted Hinata+Naruto, you got it. Otherwise, this movie is a mess, with forced love, Naruto acting like ""hot stuff"" when he clearly grew up from that, and a paint-by-numbers plotline with less action than former films.
I think I'll just go back and watch the ""power"" episodes, cause as said, the series has better filler than this so-called ""canon"" film.",1457913600,,3448,4.7164179104477615

The Naruto story has developed in such a great way that, even with all of the filler arcs that permeated the show, you kept caring about what happened to the characters.

7275907,1,B00ZCHTR6O,"I'd heard that this movie was supposed to show Naruto's (and classmates') transition into adulthood after the Fourth Great Ninja War, focusing on how Naruto starts to develop a romantic relationship with Hinata (while letting go of his childhood feelings for Sakura). Is this what happens? Well, at the beginning of the movie Hinata still has unrequited love for Naruto and at the end of the movie they are ""together"", but I wouldn't say what came between made much sense.

The first few minutes of the movie is set in post-war Konoha, Naruto is now recognized by everyone (not just other shinobi) and greatly revered as a Hero. This is a pretty big tonal shift from before the war, but the movie wants to move ahead with the plot (such that it is) and just glosses over this completely new paradigm in favor of ""developing"" the villain and watching Hinata dither around (which is also cause for complaint). Hinata is shown getting into a tizzy over whether or not to give Naruto a present that harkens back to her 12 year old self, and not the brave shinobi who tried to fight off Pain while confessing her love for Naruto, or fought again to protect Naruto in the 4th Great Ninja War. At this point, I think fans were expecting to see her act more maturely or resolutely now that she's been through so much turmoil with Naruto, but the plot wants to keep her as an indecisive twit for the majority of the movie. It's especially jarring because the whole plot hinges on her involvement, so we get to spend lots of time with regressed-Hinata, getting depressed because Naruto already has a scarf (the present she was going to give him was a scarf she had made), and convinced he doesn't like her because he is his usual oblivious self around her.

For some reason, even though Hinata clearly confessed her love at least once to him in the past, Naruto doesn't seem to acknowledge her feelings in this movie until some strange dream sequence. Then, when Hinata leaves to sacrifice herself to the enemy, he suddenly realizes that he loves her in return. I believe that by the time the war ends Naruto just sees Sakura as a good friend because Sasuke has been reintegrated into the village and Sakura's feelings for Sasuke have never, ever wavered; she and Naruto have truly become friends after fighting together in the events leading up to and during the war, now recognizing each other's strengths and respecting their individual goals and accomplishments. So, I don't take umbrage that Naruto has given up on his romantic feelings for her, but his sudden switch to Hinata was bizarre. Really, Naruto? Just a day ago you were proclaiming that you ""love"" ramen - now you ""love"" Hinata because you realize she's loved *you* forever?? What weird logic. And poor Hinata: ""I've never loved you before, but now I recognize your unconditional love for me and it has made me see that I should love you in return!""

Also, the climax is pathetic. For the duration of the movie, literally everyone drones on and on about how Hinata is the key to defeating the enemy. However, what happens during the final battle? Hinata is ""weak"" and can't deliver the finishing blow, so Naruto has to do it for her. Typical. Will there ever be a story where Naruto doesn't ultimately save the day? Yes, they want to show NaruHina as a team, but we've seen them work together during the climactic battle during the war. By now, Hinata could be taking initiative, asking Naruto for his aid (if they insist on not allowing her to have enough power on her own) to deliver the final blow. Instead, we get the same old Hinata that tries her hardest yet fails and needs Naruto to save the day.

Why does there need to be a villain at all in a movie when the point is to show a burgeoning relationship between two people? I'm not saying there shouldn't be any strife, but why is it always a maniacally laughing baddy that takes center stage? I'm sure there was plenty of material that could be mined from the whole alliance between nations. Weren't there problems with restructuring ninja mission requests between nations? Or land/resources allotment? What are the plans for all the Bijuu? Aren't the other nations concerned about the devastating blow their ninja forces took during the war? Apparently not. There is also a lot more that could be explored with Naruto's home-life (his new-found Hero status) and his role in the village as the potential next Hokage - and setting the ""romance"" at home would have probably made it more interesting. Hinata and Naruto don't share an abundance of screen time together, so I think this movie should have chosen a different type of villain, or set the whole thing in Konoha so the audience gets to actually SEE the two of them interact as adults and develop their relationship instead of: [beginning of movie]: the two of them are not harmonious [middle of movie]: random villain stuff happens! [end of movie]: Hinata x Naruto forever! Don't get me wrong, I'm a NaruHina fan and was glad they were paired up at the end of the manga. Although, I did think that the manga didn't develop their romantic relationship at all - understandable with the war etc. - so I was really hoping we'd get to see the two of them interact as young adults and secure their relationship in this movie instead of having a cut/paste plot where: the lead and romantic interest don't communicate their intentions with one another clearly, one or both ""nobly"" shoulder some sort of responsibility leaving the other bereft, and ultimately ending up together after a reconciliation during a heated finale/battle.

I don't know why Sasuke is on the cover because he is in there for a total of 23 seconds, give or take.  But all in all good, but not what you would expect from a Naruto.",1450656000,,420,3.75

7275976,4,B00ZCHTR6O,"First off I want to give credit to Amazon and UPS who delivered this on time in a blizzard. You guys totally rock and made my anime loving family quite happy.

Second regarding the movie, it didn't quite meet my expectations. I love the Naruto series and have long awaited the epic conclusion to the Hinata love saga. Lol, I wish that Masashi would have consulted a girl for the romance in the movie.  You can so tell it was written by a guy. It was good but he didn't quite get there. It was more that Naruto realized that he SHOULD love Hinata rather than that he was IN love with her. The reason that it wasn't terrible is that you feel that his feelings were changing. In the end it shows them getting married but even in the drawings there's a stiffness. If they were 2 real actors you would think that there was no chemistry. There were so many missed opportunities to portray a growing closeness. I will treasure the movie but it just falls short.

However of course this is a must see for any fan of Naruto.",1447977600,,1015,4.276041666666667

This is the most beautiful Naruto film, and shows Naruto finally falling in love with Hinata, the girl that was made just for him. I have watched this so many times in the last month that I lost track of how many it actually was!! Truly a beautiful film, even if I do wish there was more of my OTP (SasuSaku) in it.

I know a lot of people REFUSE to watch The Naruto Movies Because they are not ""Cannon"" Well You Now Have No Excuse!!! This is the First In Cannon Movie(created by somebody besides the original creator, but is approved and invented as part of the Original Story) AND IT IS AMAZING!!! The Story Takes Place 2 Years after the End of the 4th Great Ninja War, this is the story *SPOILER ALERT* of How Naruto Ends Up with Hinata.

The Story is Far Better Than Even The Best Non - Cannon Movie (in My opinion that would be The Road to Ninja, but it is still not as good as this movie), I Saw the Sequel Boruto The Movie when it came to America English Subbed which was also Pretty FRIGGIN AWESOME!

This one is a little silly (ninja escapade on the moon) and a little flighty (there is more talk about knitting in this one movie than in the combined remaining body of ninja anime) and a lot of fun.  Naruto is at his best here, and Hinata comes more into her own.  This picks up sometime after the end of the series.  It is worth it for any Naruto fan.",1445558400,,393,4.064935064935065

7276051,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"Just finished watching ""The Last - Naruto the Movie"" released by VIZ Media.
I have long been a fan of Naruto since it first appeared on Adult Swim over a decade ago, and I have followed Naruto's journey from young, uncouth child who wants to do good and accomplish something to young adulthood.
Naruto is on the cusp of adulthood in ""The Last"" - which may be the last time we see Naruto alone and without the family he so longs for.
Yet, as Naruto is finally embraced by the residents of the Hidden Leaf Village, a new danger not only threatens him and his growing relationship with Hinata; but the world as well.  Something, or someone is causing the moon to fall to Earth, and the individual responsible is after Hinata and her sister.
To stop individual from destroying the Earth, Naruto and his friends must not only make the journey to the moon, but Naruto must make an internal journey as well, if he is to find the strength not only to save the world, but save his own personal future as well.
Strongly Recommended!
Five Stars!",1445126400,,1034,4.470899470899471

7276053,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"Best Naruto movie ever!!!!, If you love watching Naruto this movie is a must buy.",1445040000,,81,4.466666666666667
7276054,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"This movie is stunning. I truly mean that. I tend to be very hard on movies, especially ""tie-in"" movies that frequently are desperate cash-grabs with little more than visuals to speak for them. This movie puts those to shame. I'll list my reasons for loving this particular movie below in quick order.

1. The story:
The plot of this story is beautiful, and in many ways, even subtle. Yes, there is a villain and a world-destroying plot, but the heart of this movie is in watching a young man realize what someone else means to him, then watching him have to fight against brutal odds to return that person's love. The way that this realization of someone else's love hits Naruto, and the way he has to grow and mature as a person because of it are...just incredible. This is exactly the type of plot this story needs.

2. The characters:
By this, I mean the main characters, Naruto and Hinata, whom this story revolves around. This movie makes you care, and care a LOT about them. They feel believable---their emotions make sense, and you can both laugh at their stumbles but also cheer for them. You WANT them to reach their goals, and you wait to see if they really can get there. But that's not all--as you watch, note how many times these characters don't talk in scenes, but their emotions clearly show in their body language and expression. This is a brilliant move---instead of having the characters just spout off melodramatic dialogue at each other, we as an audience are treated to the idea that we can see what is happening for ourselves. This is the subtlety of character development that makes this story a treat.

3. The visual design:
""But wait, I thought you said stories weren't all about visuals?"" True, but visuals do enhance storytelling, and this story has them in spades. The locations are gorgeous, hauntingly beautiful, and imaginative. The use of computer-generated-imagery is suitably sparing, and the fight scenes are gorgeously rendered. There will be plenty of ""wow"" moments, even though they are not the central focus of the story.

4. The soundtrack:
The soundtrack fits the movie like a glove. The musical choices are excellent, with several key musical themes running throughout the story. There are also multiple nostalgic tracks that will please any long-time fan of the series.

Last note: Accessibility-- This movie is certainly a must for Naruto fans, but I stand by my claim non-fans should take a look as well. My long-time girlfriend watched the movie with me in theaters with absolutely no prior knowledge of the series other than a 5-minute peek on Wikipedia. When it was over, SHE suggested we watch it again. This story has been built so well that even with its large number of inside references, there is still a solid, action-filled love story available for those who haven't seen or read Naruto.

Bottom line: buy the movie. It's astounding.",1445040000,5,2890,4.804828973843058
7276055,5,B00ZCHTR6O,I love Naruto though I have not seen all of Naruto Shippuden. I bought this movie for my sister and we both loved it. I just hope it is not the end of Naruto's adventures I really want to see him become Hokage.,1444953600,,210,3.9069767441860463

7276062,3,B00ZCHTR6O,"Well first of all I like to say the movie works, even if it is slow at times. I was hoping for a fight between Naruto and Sasuke,  but that never happens; in fact Sasuke is only in this movie for about four minutes. This is a love story, it take place after the fourth ninja war. It is ten years to be exact. Naruto is like a celebrity in the village now and all the women want to get with him. Sakura tries to play match maker, trying to get the two, (Naruto and Hinata) to admit they have feelings for each other. Hinata is devoted to Naruto as we all well know, but Naruto is clueless to her feelings for him. So the bad guy comes in and makes trouble for the Leaf village. You guessed it, so it is up to Naruto and friends to make it right. Oh, one more thing; the bad guy has a crush on Hinata and wants to marry her.

So this is where I have my issues: Who is the Hokagi at the time of the movie; Lady Tsunade or Kakashi? In the movie has Kakashi barking out orders, while Tsunade stood in the background silent. So Naruto and friends go on their mission, now it is the middle of winter and everyone is wearing a winter jacket. Except Hinata, who is wearing a sleeveless shirt, so tell me why is that? Another thing that bother me was the whole gang there, except Neji, why was that? He is not in Baruto, Naruto the next movie either, was he killed off? It seems Guy is in a wheel chair permitly now, why is that?

Watch the credits and stay tune past the credits to see where Buruto Naruto the movie comes in. It is not to well explain of course. But you will figure it out.",1444694400,,1581,4.012698412698413

7276066,5,B00ZCHTR6O,5/5 product and experience.,1444521600,,27,6.0
7276067,4,B00ZCHTR6O,"Naruto has been an action/adventure type of story, not a romance, but whether it involves school-child crushes or self-sacrificial actions, romance has been an element in the story, even an important one at times. Simply think about The Promise, or Hinata's actions during the battle with Pein.

One of the things that irked me about the series was that, following the battle with Pein, there was almost no acknowledgment of Hinata's words and actions. There may have been a few nods to it during the big last fight, which was fine, but it was rather muted. Which brings us to this movie.

There is plenty of action and fighting in this movie. Pretty much all of the main characters get screen time. Sasuke has a memorable moment, though he was in it much more briefly than I thought he would be, considering he's on the cover. A kaiju-like battle is a part of the final fight, and Naruto pulls out a trick he used in the original series and uses it against the bad guy here. And though it happens off-camera, there's even a point where normally gentle and quiet Hinata goes Uchiha and yanks someone's eyes out. She had good reason for it.

Of course, the real story of this movie is how things fare between Naruto and Hinata. It did treat some of the things that happened between them during the Ninja War, brief things though they might have been, as if they hadn't happened, or as if Naruto had simply forgotten about them, which I'll admit rather puzzled me. It begins the story as if Naruto had no idea of Hinata's long-held feelings toward him, but that it takes a trip down memory lane for him to recall some of the things that had happened and their significance.

Still, the movie does hit a lot of the right notes. There are scenes when their struggles with what to do or not do, or what to say or not say, are rather amusing, and times when those struggles are frustrating, too. And right after one of them finally works up the nerve to say what needs saying, well, trouble comes a-calling.

For the most part, it does treat this aspect of the story with respect. Naruto shows some thoughtfulness in regards to his responses when he figures out her feelings towards him, a welcomed change from the jump-before-thinking character he often was early in the series. His fit of tiff was kinda unexpected, but it did set up a nice discussion with Sakura, showing the changed friendship the two teammates now have.

There are a few things I could quibble about, especially regarding the fight on the moon's surface. If, for example, it was an airless place like the moon in the real world, and it seemed to be that way, then fighting on the surface could be...difficult. And it might have been interesting if they'd done some things with the gravity change.

On the whole, this is a good way to essentially finish the series, and I guess set up for things like the Boruto movie. Fans of the series should be happy with it.",1444521600,,2927,4.53219696969697

As a fan loving Naruto and watching through my early teens, it is a great story and the movie was worth for myself as a huge NaruHina fan. Of course there's some technology that is in the movie,  is always questionable to how ninjas make it but soundtrack is phenomenal and the opening blows me away with the background of ""What Child is This?"" With the beginning being black and white and incredible animation telling a story very well for my roommate who didn't watch the series in the beginning until after the movie.

7276079,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"I've been closely following the franchise for 10 years and this was the epitome of my hopes for the series. To finally see the hero of this journey (who was orphaned and outcast his entire life) fall in love for the first time with a girl who had deep feelings for him since they were children. It's not just an action anime of ninjas and saving the world, it's about the human experience. The feelings we all have felt or want to feel. Something I've waited faithfully for 10 years and it was nothing short of amazing.

Naruto and Hinata are a true love story. It gives all hope relating to a hero who made all his dreams come true. It brings you to tears",1444176000,2,656,4.248

7276083,4,B00ZCHTR6O,"This movie for a conclusion to the main Naruto story line went out on a pretty decent bang.  I wish though that it would have featured more on characters that were an important part in said story, such as Sasuke, Lee, and more.  Kakashi pops in a couple of times but he could have been seen more as well to wrap everything up nicely.  DON'T LET THE COVER ART FOOL YOU! Not saying this is a bad movie but it does mainly focus on Naruto and Hinata, it flushes out more of Hinata's character as well as the relationship between her and Naruto.  If you are a romantic fool you will be gushing over it,  All in all I would say this is a must see,  Not to mention you get an exclusive very...very short story (maybe two pages) that bridges the gap between The Last and Boruto, thee latter of which I can not wait to see!

Sauske is in the movie but for a short while still with this incredible love story between hinata and Naruto this movie is also recommended for couples too.this also comes with a mini manga comic its two pages but it takes place after the movie its funny and a nice bonus. So if you're a fan of Naruto or looking for a love story (better than twilight, the notebook, titanic, etc. In my opinion) look no further this movie delivers the goods.",1444089600,2,788,4.441379310344828

7276087,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"Wow. Just wow. I did not buy this movie online but at my local Hastings today for $19.99 with $21.64 as a total. There are some things you just have to go get in person and I had a pleasant conversation with the sales person who got it for me. He was surprised that this film came out today and that the final volume of the Naruto manga also came out as well. Now to the movie review:

 The movie was good. Not GREAT but still very good. I loved the whole theme the movie was representing but despite being over an hour and a-half it seemed to go by too quick action-wise and the slower parts seemed to be inflated. The plot had some holes and I personally thought that many characters didn't get enough screen time. The secondary protagonists didn't get to show off all of their abilities and their final battles were left unsatisfactory with the efforts of the lead protagonists responsible for their victory. It made me laugh. It made me cry. My feelings for Naruto and Hinatas happiness goes beyond joy and I truly did enjoy this movie despite its few flaws. I highly recommend this film to the supporters and lovers of Naruto everywhere! My favorite Naruto film because it's actually canon and doesn't have a crappy story line like some of it's predecessors!  Update: May 17, 2018 9:52 pm. Ive been going through the other reviews and cant help but notice that those fogging a 1 Star are all butt hurt NaruSaku fans so don't waste your time listening to them complain.",1444089600,,1473,4.4684014869888475
7276088,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"The animation quality is the best it has ever been, and the story is great, for a Naruto movie that is. In other words, the story is predictable and falls into the Shonen Jump furmula, but still enjoyable. The biggest compliment I can give the story is that it gives great closure to the characters we have all grown up with. This story feels like Canon, where as the previous Naruto movies all felt like what they were, filler. I am very satisfied with Naruto's final movie as the lead character.",1444089600,,497,4.472527472527473
7276089,4,B00ZCHTR6O,"This is the first canon movie in the show. As well, it's mostly a romance story about how Naruto fell in love with Hinata.
The movie is overall pretty awesome. I only have two problems:
1. Needs more content for the extra features. More behind the scenes would be nice.
2. Boruto and Naruto have the same voice actor in the English version, while they have different voice actors in the Japanese version",1444089600,,403,4.534246575342466
7276090,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"If you have seen the Naruto anime or read the manga, this movie might be a little different than what you're use to. This movie is not fully focusing on the action or story between the love of Sasuke and Naruto. For the first time, Kishimoto dedicated this movie for the pairings of ""certain"" characters (try not to spoil it for anime viewers).

Honestly this movie was well done, the animation is great, and the story is good. I would like to have the movie a little bit longer to include other pairings that were made at the end of the series (more like a summary of how they got together).

Don't let the one star reviewers deceive you on this purchase. It is worth it if you're a Naruto fan, whether you like the pairings or not. Come on, it is the first Naruto movie that is CANON! Don't pick this movie up if you are into the Naruto battle scenes because nothing can really top the war arc or Sasuke vs. Naruto pt. 2.

It makes more sense and goes with the flow in the story. The only reason NaruHina happened was because of the fanbase. Naruto had only loved Sakura. We've never seen Naruto like Hinata. And then the movie showed up and apparently he now likes her because she likes him. Anime logic I guess. I did enjoy *all* of Team 7 kick ass though XD,1443744000,,478,4.322222222222222

7276095,1,B00ZCHTR6O,"This movie goes against everything that is canon to the manga and is claimed to be only the canon movie, how ironic. Not only that but it destroys the development of characters such as Naruto and Sakura for example. Naruto is the worst offender because by looking at this movie, Naruto is a scumbag who only views women as trophies and is apparently too dense to know the difference between true love and his love of ramen, we all know Naruto isn't too sharp but he's not that completely idiotic. Another unheard of thing is that he actually gives up which goes against what his character stands for, and guess what for, because Hinata left him after he ""realized his feelings for her"". Give me a break, not only did Naruto show any sort of romantic feelings towards any girl in the manga except Sakura, out of nowhere he falls for Hinata through genjutsu as pity because she ""loved"" Naruto. This is a girl he only had about 30 something pages interactions with in a 700 chapter manga.

Beside that point the main problem with this movie is that its not even a Naruto movie, it's Hinata's movie. An bland underdeveloped side character without any signifigance is put upon a pedestal and praised as the greatest thing ever pretty much at the cost of other characters development. Why is it that this happened? Well it comes down to what happened at the end of the manga. In any fandom you'll always have that loud vocal minority and for Naruto's fandom that would be the shippers. Unfortunately for the ending, all it was about was who ended up with who, unfortunately the loudest ships got the ending, and they weren't even the pairings that the story was going towards(No matter what Kishi says in favor of it at this point are just damage control and lies).

The ending was just a big sellout to make money by Studio Perriot, that is not the true ending and I have no idea if we will ever get it which is unfortunate. Kishi either sabotaged his ending cause he lost control of his story because thats not how the story was intended or he just stopped caring.

TLDR
Anyways to wrap this review rant up, the only way for this movie to make any sense is for you to have never read the manga or watched the anime, otherwise its just retcons and ignores canon. Hinata the bland side character is the star of this movie, this movie was to explain how Naruto and Hinata ended up together(You shouldn't have to make a movie for that but those 2 weren't meant to be because no development) but in turn it just trashes the entire story and insults the fans intelligence. I know it sounds like I'm hating on Hinata a lot but its only because she is treated as an important character more important then the main characters which simply isn't true she is nothing more then a side character and that's it.

Dont waste your money or time with this movie, if you want to watch a good Naruto movie go watch Road to Ninja. Forgive me for the long rant review.",1443484800,8,2944,4.456400742115028
7276096,1,B00ZCHTR6O,"Insult to all Naruto movies and the series in general , kishimoto  wrote the biggest load of crap he has ever anyone with a brain can see that this movie had lazy writing, major plot holes and it was a horrible way to introduce  the hinata and Naruto paring no development at all honesty  if I could give this movie zero stars I would please don't buy this movie watch it online or something  but please don't save your money.",1443484800,5,426,4.2875
7276097,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"The Last Naruto the Movie, has been something many fans have been waiting for. Not only is this movie canon but is the beginning of the end of Naruto's journey to becoming Hokage. The concept and character design were created by Kishimoto but the script was written by Tsuneo Kobayashi with the intention of the movie being a love story. Kobayashi delivered. This movie is a love story but also maintains the comedy and personality of the characters that fans know and love. The direction of the story does not take away from the character development but depicts how these characters are maturing from kids that have dreams to young adults who are attaining those dreams and leading their own lives.

This movie was made to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the franchise as well as the first installment of the Naruto Project. The Naruto project contains light novels and manga-shorts that expand on the story after the end of the manga and this movie. In particular, the novels called Naruto Hiden and Naruto Shinden will feature events involving many favorite characters from after this movie to the start of Naruto Gaiden and Boruto. They are currently released in Japan with an English releases from Viz in November 2015 and able to preorder on amazon now.",1442534400,11,1264,4.851851851851852

Also some people should also remember this is Animie and not real life.",1440547200,2,267,4.254901960784314
7276103,1,B00ZCHTR6O,"This movie show cases the ruination of fifteen years of work and the absolute decimation of our beloved characters and their personalities. The only people who will enjoy this piece of garbage are shoujo fans who only cared about which person got together with that person. So unless you enjoy some of your favorite characters turn against everything they stood for in the Manga I suggest you torrent this and don't waste your money or time, either way you'll soon learn why this series lost over half it's fan base and the hero Naruto himself is now known as the ultimate scum bag.",1439596800,7,582,4.660194174757281
7276104,5,B00ZCHTR6O,"Out of all the Naruto Movies that I've seen (I've seen all of them), I rank this one the highest among the ""Must Buy"" list. Why? Because it's the only one that actually develops the overall story-line. Events that occur in this movie will have direct impact on the overall story to come in the next movie and manga. You can't say the same about any other Naruto movies such as Blood Prison, The Lost Tower, and Bonds. For example, the situation between Naruto and Hinata in this movie will explain the events that occur in the future of the main story. This is not the only example, but I just wanted to give you a minor example of what I meant without spoiling anything. In any case, the movie is more like a sequel for the Fourth Shinobi War more than anything. The beginning of the movie shows you the technological advancements after the war as well as how all the characters are doing. The rest of the movie sets up events that happened to Naruto and Hinata.

Note: New movie called Boruto comes out October, 10th!!!",1439337600,33,1021,4.430851063829787
