2561764,1,B000FDEE7C,It was a waste of 2 dollars. I was highly disappointed,1408579200,,54,4.0
2561765,1,B000FDEE7C,"Terrible acting, idiotic storyline, horrible sets and make-up, out-dated scooby doo background music. No one in this films acting was believable.  Sabrina the teenage witch makes pervert zombies to get back at the funeral home.  Rotten corpse = skeleton covered in chocolate pudding.  Music is a few string instruments with a flute mixed in to make it sound mysterious, seriously an episode of scooby do blows this away.  I wanted to turn this off after 10 minutes but kept watching so i could give fair review, thats when i started to realize the true nature of this movie.  This is basically a soft core porn movie, all the main women in the movie take thier clothes off at some point.  I cant see anyone other then people involved in it saying this film was good, Dont waste your time.",1407888000,2,788,4.633093525179856
2561766,4,B000FDEE7C,"The Revolting Dead was fun and interesting, a nice surprise as it turned out. The story does several things new and different for a zombie movie, which takes some doing these days. The characters interested me and sometimes I even cared what happened to them. The acting and occasional humor are a bit over the top but not too badly. I like a good zombie movie, but the problem is that most, even when you adjust your expectations for micro-budget, aren't that good. Overall, I enjoyed watching this one.",1403568000,,504,4.674157303370786
2561767,1,B000FDEE7C,I couldn't make it through the first 15 minutes & had to turn it off. I wasted money on this junk. Dont buy it!,1399680000,,111,3.6666666666666665
2561768,5,B000FDEE7C,"Super fun and great for a party crowd ready to be ""creeped"" out and laugh! Loved the writing!! Never a dull moment! A Halloween must!",1399334400,2,133,4.36
2561769,3,B000FDEE7C,"There is nothing like a clever title. In this film a family of undertakers rob graves and recycle coffins. When a witch (Shelley Delayne) makes this discovery, she casts a spell which allows the dead to come back to life and get revenge. Toss in a dead girlfriend, a dead brother, and the undertakers doing some of their own killings and you got the film.

This is a low budget production which had some uneven sound problems. The dialogue went from bad to corny. The acting wasn't there. The film waited too late to introduce the zombies.

The girls were pretty and sometimes that's all I need.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity (Shelley Delayne, Lindsey Lofaso , Stephanie Christine Medina- thank you)",1388102400,3,706,4.770491803278689
2561770,4,B000FDEE7C,"This one is worth your time!  It's not classic cinema, but it's a pretty good effort by some people who know what OUGHT to be in a zombie movie.

Special effects and gore are decent.  The plot makes sense.  The acting is suprisingly good.  There are a couple of glitches in continuity, but -hey- it's a low budget zombie flick for crying out loud!

The best aspect of this movie is that it has a sense of humor.  The wicked stepmother, who sometimes has a British accent, is a hoot!  She alone is worth the price of admission!",1195776000,,526,4.295918367346939
2561771,3,B000FDEE7C,"This film was fun, a bit silly but still fun. The acting is very B. (No Oscar performances) The premiss was almost believable, Strange things do happen in the mortuary business. The characters are all over the top caricatures, but that was what made it fun. It's not particularly scary, it's more of a rowdy romp in graveyards with creepy people. If it were a 1950ies black and white film, it would have be considered terrifying in it's day. But we require more to be scared these days.

The music was the most professional aspect of the film, it was actually quite good. It was an interesting blend of classical orchestral music and head banging heavy metal. The ""Revolting Dead Theme Song"" played at the end could be a Halloween favorite, if anyone were to ever hear it.

I like happy endings, in this film justice is served, and bad guys get their what they deserve. Now we are safe to back about our business. Or are we?",1165104000,3,924,4.494047619047619

2561779,4,B000FDEE7C,"I liked this one. The 'comic relief' of the bad folks was a bit too much, but overall, I liked this movie.

It didn't have tons of zombie action of super great acting, but this is a what a lower budget zombie movie should be.",1449100800,,225,4.0

2561782,1,B000FDEE7C,"This would have been a great movie if: It had acting, a story, a plot thicker than paper, dialogue, special effects, suspense, entertainment and perhaps a tiny bit of intelligence. I really don't know what else to say about this so-called movie. About the only compliment I can come up with is that it might cure your insomnia.",1447372800,,327,4.655172413793103

8121205,3,B000FDEE7C,"Average low-budget thriller about the dead crawling out of their graves to seek revenge on a family of delinquent grave robbers. You can walk away from this movie - do some laundry - come back - do some dishes - come back - fold some laundry.... and never miss a twist in this one. It's as if someone gave them a time limit to work within and they worked hard to fill it.

It is watchable - but don't expect much.",1473724800,,413,4.098765432098766
