8295110,3,B001DWN5U6,"This DVD is an advance promotional film for Ricky's celebrated 2006 appearance on MTV's UNPLUGGED.  Ricky and the musicians are seen rehearsing and also comment on the music and production (important note: all speak in Spanish except for a rare sentence in English here and there and there are no subtitles).  The film runs about 30 minutes and the lone ""bonus feature"" is the complete song  ""Tu Recuerdo"" from the program.

This DVD has a curiously steep list price given the actual concert program is also on DVD for less than half that amount, however it appears this DVD may have initially been a ""promo"" release in it's original release at a low budget price like several other DVDs of this nature, seemingly confirmed by the number of Amazon marketplace sellers who have it at a very low price.  If you're a major fan of Ricky Martin's you will no doubt want this DVD for your collection but for the newer fans or ones who just want the music I would recommend purchasing the actual program RICKY MARTIN UNPLUGGED or some of his other excellent DVDs like 17 or ONE NIGHT ONLY instead.",1285113600,6,1090,4.626943005181347
