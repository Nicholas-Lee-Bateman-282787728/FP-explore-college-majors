1258538,5,B000035Z4H,"I first saw this film six months after I returned from my junior year in the south of France. I laughed so often and shook my head in embarrassment so much at myself and when it was only part way done, I wondered how any writer could possibly have seen all those quirks in so many different people and hit them all so exactly dead on the money. I recognized my friends over and over and well, it was such a pleasantly-acted film and a completely lovely story that even after twenty years I remembered it very fondly and longed to see it again. I finally found it and you know, it still brings a misty eye and an out loud laugh and a warm smile to look back over the years and remember how young we were, how curious and serious and silly all at once, and how, when we weren't looking, someone out there was, and knew us better even than we knew ourselves. Mme si all you'll ever know of French is 'Bonjour', you simply must have this charming film.",1042070400,4,948,4.185792349726776
1258539,4,B000035Z4H,"This movie brought back memories, of when I was a teenager Its just as I remember it..Only one thing, and it did upset me. I don't know if people will notice. There is a scene almost at the end when Joel and Toni are leaving and there parents run into each other, its here where I noticed something was missing?? The music..in the original movie it had Nicolette Larson's Lotta Love.. In this video its been deleted, and that really pained me, because that was part of the reason I bought this movie. I did not notice until later that it mentioned this on the cover of the video, I wonder why this was done. However overall the movie is safe clean AMERICAN fun from the 70's.. Great comedy.",1001894400,15,690,4.3565891472868215

This is probably the only known documentation in film or literature of the practice of making FREE international phone calls from pay phones in Paris, an important phenomenon in the 70's.  The movie is also notable for a brief appearance by Debra Winger in what may well be her first speaking role in a movie.",986256000,6,498,4.584269662921348

1258554,4,B000035Z4H,"NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONCERNS THE OLIVE FILMS DVD AND BLU-RAY RELEASE OF THIS FILM

This is a wonderful and very neglected film from the late 70s, made by the same couple who co-wrote ""American Graffiti"" and (uncredited) part of ""Star Wars.""

The best news is that I have it from Olive Films that they are releasing the original theatrical version.  An earlier DVD release didn't have the original music in spots and it hurt the film.  This will be the way people saw it in the theaters in 1979.  I enthusiastically recommend it.",1462492800,,526,4.612903225806452

1258560,4,B000035Z4H,A good human comedy.  The only fault with the DVD is the original music track has been replaced.  It was integral to the story and therefore diminishes the impact.,1391040000,3,163,4.586206896551724
1258571,3,B000035Z4H,"This is one of my favorite light comedies of the 1970s and it pains me to give a five-star film a mere three.  But Paramount (a company that has done this sort of thing before, notably deleting the haunting song ""Goodnight Sweetheart"" from the classic Star Trek episode ""The City on the Edge of Forever,"" only recently restored to the episode on DVD) has, as other reviewers have noted, butchered a soundtrack that was an intrinsic part of the immense charm of this likeable, funny film.  The humor in the first scene, for instance, comes from the American students being told to ""forget everything American""--and then the bus driver turns on a tape of a French-language version of ""Do You Believe in Magic?""  Now he turns on a completely unmemorable French tune, and the humor is lost.  Somebody at Paramount should learn from the experience of ""City on the Edge of Forever"" and restore this film's rightful soundtrack, regardless of music clearance costs.",1383177600,4,957,4.852760736196319

1258574,3,B000035Z4H,"I used to love this movie and have seen it many many times (I have an old copy on VHS that I recorded years ago).  So I was quite disappointed when I watched the DVD version and the songs were changed from the original.  It also seems to me they did some editing, which certainly changed the flavor a bit, but I might be wrong.

I paid a bit under $7, so I'm not too upset.  But art is art and I prefer the original.",1363219200,3,416,3.8588235294117648
1258575,3,B000035Z4H,"It is still a charming film, but the butchering of the music is inexcusable. At one moment, I turned to my viewing friend and stated that one of the best marriages of scene to music was about to take place. I was livid thay ""Just One Look"" had been removed from the scene where Alex is spying on the ever beautiful Pisier in the changing room. Bring back a version with the entire original score.
Anyone have an idea of where I can find these originals or how to edit the original back in?",1347062400,3,489,4.212765957446808
1258576,3,B000035Z4H,"Was so excited to see that Amazon.com carried this movie that I immediatly purchased it in the DVD format. I once owned the movie in the VHS format many years ago. I enjoyed the movie so much and remember watching it on TV. One of the many reasons I enjoyed the movie was that I absolutely love the soundtrack which included Do You Believe In Magic, Lotta Love & Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow performed in French. When I received the DVD in the mail I proceeded to watch it anticipating these songs, but to my dismay I thought that I missed hearing these songs I went back to replay scene selections from the movie. Not being able to locate where these songs played out, I decided to go back and read the reviews @ Amazon.com only to find that it was 'edited/deleted' out completely! Just to make a note, all these songs are still listed at the end after the 'credits'. This is so disappointing...give me the 'original' movie & soundtrack any day!",1304467200,5,949,4.428571428571429

1258578,1,B000035Z4H,"I've always loved French Postcards but I was totally disappointed with this new DVD version which completed destroyed the movie because all of the music was replaced!
For me, the music is just as integral to a movie as the actors, directing and the story itself! I had the same shocking experience with the new version of LEGENDS when Ridley Scott decided to replace the whole magical soundtrack with some weirdo soundtrack by a friend (I assume)! So no more Loved by the Sun by Jon Anderson and tangerine dream!
Whatever

The same here with french postcards. I LOVED the french version of Do you believe in magic in the beginning that sets the tone of the movie right from the start! Nicolette Larson's Lotta Love was also excised from the ending in a critical scene between Joel and the lovely Valrie Quennessen (R.I.P)! Also missed Just One Look as Madame Tessier dances as she tries on jeans. Plus many more moments ...gone.

Thank goodness I recorded the original version of French Postcards when it was on A&E! I have it on DVD now and enjoy it every now and then. This new DVD stinks. Don't bother watching it, nevermind spending money on it.",1261785600,7,1149,4.627450980392157
1258579,5,B000035Z4H,"I loove this movie and have been waiting patiently for it to appear on dvd since I wore out my vhs copy of it. It's basically a sweet movie about a group of twenty somethings that are studying in Paris for a year. The stand out performances are from David Marshall Grant, Miles Chapin, and Blanche Baker. Oh, and Valerie Quennessen is in this one too. you may remember her from Summer Lovers with Peter Gallagher. Her life was cut short tragically to an fatal car accident. Marie France Pisier also shines as the head mistress who David's character is infatuated with. Also, Debra Winger and Mandy Patinkin both shine in brief, but necessary points in the film. Dont' rent this movie. Buy it and I guarantee that it will be one you watch again and again.",1234310400,,754,4.510948905109489
1258580,5,B000035Z4H,"I loved this movie when they played it on HBO back in the 80's. One of the best things was all the pop songs done in the French language like ""Do You Believe In Magic?"" and ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow?"". I hadn't seen it in over 20 yeras and was overjoyed when I saw it was coming out on DVD. Imagine my horror to hear they replaced most of the soundtrack with elevator muzak! All the great songs were gone! This would be like the French ""American Grafitti"". Of course it was done to save money. George Lucus has said that he paid more for all those old songs in ""American Grafitti"" than he would have paid for an original soundtrack. But I still want the original ""French Postcards"" restored! Even if it was more money!",1226016000,12,725,4.260869565217392

I seen it before on TV but If I knew the music was change, It would gave me more to decide if I still wanted to purchase the movie or not If I would have known.

1258592,5,B000035Z4H,"What can I say? Ever since I first saw this movie, I had fallen deeply in love with Valerie Quennessen. I seen just about every movie she has been in, and it was with a deep depression that I had found out one day while looking her up to see what happened to her, that she had died. She had so much to offer!

This movie just plain touched me. It involved just about everything that I had WISHED I could have done with my life back when I was younger, but never did. The bacground of Paris is so beautiful, and the adventures so much fun. One scene in particular that gave me a chuckle, was when Joel was staying at home with the old French lady and watching Star Trek - dubbed in FRENCH LOL! Reminded me of a story my brother told me about when he was stationed in Germany - how he was watching Casablanca, dubbed in German. He told me how the dubbed voice for Bogart was some high pitched squeky guy LOL.

But if you want a fun and enjoyable movie, with some truly unforgettable characters in it, do see this movie!!!!!!!! And if like me, you get blown away by the beauty of Valerie Quennessen, then your next stop would be Summer Lovers.",1216512000,11,1140,4.177272727272728
1258593,5,B000035Z4H,"First of all, I'm very grateful that ""French Postcards"" finally has made it to DVD.  I fell in love with this movie on HBO back in 1980, when it seemed to be on at least once a day. It's a sweet and funny movie that perfectly captures that in-between stage of life when you're in college.

The cast is terrific: The late Valerie Quennessen is completely enchanting as Toni, a young French woman who falls in love with bookish American student Joel (Miles Chapin). There's also Blanche Baker, hilarious as she travels through Europe checking out the graves of famous authors. The DVD packaging makes a big deal out of Debra Winger being in the cast, but she barely gets any screen time.

The movie is delightful, but as for the DVD? Well, although the box doesn't state it, the music has been changed from the original release. Part of the movie's charm (and a comic comment on the scenes) was the use of French-language versions of American pop songs, including ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"" and ""Do You Believe in Magic."" Those have all been excised, replaced by generic-sounding French songs. There were some well-known English-language recordings in here, too: The Kinks' ""(Wish I Could Fly Like) Superman"" and Nicolette Larson's ""Lotta Love"" were both prominently featured. Now, the Kinks' song has been replaced with an anoynmous dance tune; the Larson song has been replaced by...silence.

Perhaps the weirdest move of all involves a play the students put on.  During the course of the production, Baker leads the students in singing Cole Porter's ""You Don't Know Paree."" However, the sequence in which Baker performs a solo has been completely removed. Then, instead of hearing the students sing the song, we see the students on stage, mouthing the words to the Porter song but the soundtrack has a chorus of tuneless people chanting: ""I love Paris, oh how I love Paris, I love Paris, it's here I want to stay."" OK, even if you've never seen the movie before, I think that would be noticeable.

The movie is presented in widescreen and the picture is fine, but the butchering is a major disappointment. I realize this wasn't a hit movie, but it's still wildly annoying. There are no extras and the packaging is rather sloppy: Even Quennessen's name is misspelled on the box cover. So, again -- love the movie, wished the DVD was better. Still, it's better than nothing.",1214870400,45,2374,4.778048780487805
1258594,4,B000035Z4H,"If you are looking for an intellectually challenging film, this isn't it.

French Postcards is, however, a charming, sweet story about the hopes and expectations of Americans studying in Paris for a year.

I first saw this film on Cinemax in the early 80s, and thanks to having picked up a VHS copy of it a few years ago, I have continued to enjoy this little gem of a guilty pleasure. I appreciate aspects of it further now that I've been to Paris myself a few times.

Contrary to the implication of the item description for this film, Debra Winger (in one of her earliest acting roles) does not play a major role in the film. Her character does, however, appear at various junctures, often injecting bits of humour. Mandy Patinkin makes a brief, though somewhat key appearance in the film as Laura's (Blanche Baker) chauvinistic Iranian weekend traveling companion.

The story revolves around four main characters: a somewhat socially clumsy but likable Joel (Miles Chapin); serious, humourless, prudish tourist-y Laura (Baker), whose postcards home to her boyfriend give the film its title; romantic musician, Alex (David Marshall Grant), who falls for the French Institute's co-director (Marie-France Pisier); and Toni (the late Valrie Quennessen), a Parisienne with whom Joel falls in love.

The story is, for the most part, light and funny, but there are nonetheless a few poignant moments. One of my favourite moments in the film is Alex's performance of a song (""The Thing Of It Is"") written for Madame Tessier (Pisier) in lieu of the assigned essay. ""A romantic look at a classic situation,"" he describes it.

Veteran actor Jean Rochefort also plays a central role in the film as Madame Tessier's husband and the Institute's brusk co-director.

Again, while not a major breakthrough motion picture, it's a delightful little film, and I'm looking forward to the release of the DVD.",1213401600,3,1889,4.996815286624204
1258595,5,B000035Z4H,"This movie is just plain, old fashioned, FANTASTIC FUN!
It was written/produced by the same team of writers and producers (Huyck & Katz) that penned American Grafitti and you can definitely see a similar thematic flavor (learn the big lessons of life/self realization before adulthood) flowing through this movie!
I find myself wanting to see this movie every six months or so, just to catch up with a few old friends - that's the way the characters affect you in this movie - you want to go home with them and hang out with them and see what they're up to today! I fell in love with Toni (Valerie Quennessen) and Madame Tessier (Marie France Pisier); Joel (Miles Chapin) and Alex (David Marshall Grant) feel like they are my two best buds! Joel is absolutely hilarious when he tries to convince Mssr. Tessier to go 'get a beer' with him so he can prevent his best friend Alex from being discovered in bed with Madame Tessier. When he begs the Headmaster of the French Institute where he is studying to stop his car by jumping on the moving vehicle in desperation as if he's dying and then, after finally getting the drivers attention, he just saunters up to the window and casually asks ""so, ... wanna get a beer?"" as if they are old buddies - I am absolutely screaming with laughter! He is forced to pretend to be FREAKING OUT on DOPE in order to convince the guy to go to the hospital in the hopes of having him avoid catching his wife in bed with Alex! This endears the Joel character to you because we all love a person that cares enough to risk his very reputation and future (""20 yrs in my own Country and nothing like this ever happened to me - you're right - I am FREAKING OUT"") for his friend! This is Ben Stiller-esque style comedy with the subtle nuances of facial ticks and casual glances - I find Miles Chapin to be a very, very funny and charming actor!
I love the scene where he is trying to fit in with some French students on a screwy date and he wins the heart of the adorably cute and sexy Toni because he's so genuine and funny!
You will LOVE this flick - lots of cool surprises, first time sightings of future stars (Debra Winger's first speaking part in a small role as another student at the Institute; Mandy Patinkin as a Persian chauvinist)  and great, touching, little scenes (the scene where Alex and Joel say GOOD BYE at the end is very well done and almost makes you want to cry) as well as some real significant life lessons make this a very enjoyable movie experience that you may want to watch five or ten times!",1174176000,7,2545,4.380549682875264
1258596,5,B000035Z4H,"I love this movie and it is one of my all time favorites I watch over and over again. It reminds me of my many many firsts in college in the early 70's: First time on a plane (an inaugural Pan-AM 747 flight from JFK to Paris [I still have the certificate each passenger received]); first time overseas; first time in Paris; my first time speaking a language in its native surroundings; and other first times a little too personal to share publicly -- but when in France, do as the French do!!!! (nudge nudge wink wink!) I had the opportunity to study French language and literature at the Sorbonne in Paris in my junior and senior year of college so I took the challenge! As I watch the film, I imagine myself as being Joel (Miles Chapin) who wouldn't be caught dead without his Larousse de Poche for fear of saying something wrong! His bit where he speaks to everyone in  fractured French is hilarious as he tries to convince his peers to immerse themselves into the whole French scene as instructed by their advisors. His accent is horrible and his French is very gutteral - as my one French prof said at the Sorbonne, ""On parle francais comme une vache espagnole"" (One speaks French like a Spanish cow), a very degrading insult to any budding Francophile or student soon to become a French instructor as I. Marie-France Pissier (JE VOUS ADORE!!!!) is a beautiful actress at home in a comedy like this or in a very serious role such as Chanel Solitaire. A very talented actress who has grown more beautiful as she ages. I make it a point to see/own every film she has done. Jean Rochefort is one of those actors that you remark ""Where have I seen him before?"" A classic French character actor with the acting aplomb of Marie-France, quite comfortable doing comedy, drama, or a classic by Moliere. Valerie Quennessen is charming as Toni, the English-speaking French girl who works in a college bookstore that Joel frequents (sorry to say, she died in an auto accident in France in 1989 at the age of 31). Her career included a film with Darryl Hanna and Peter Gallagher called SUMMER LOVERS in 1982.

This film also featured the debut of such stars as Debra Winger, Mandy Patinkin, Blanche Baker, and David Marshall Grant. David is playing the classic college screw-up who went to France to ""find himself"" and speaks Franglais 1/2 English and 1/2 poor French. Prime example was when Madame Tessier sees he is having problems studying and offers him some tutelage. His reply to her was ""Pourquoi me?"" He soon absconds the whole French scene to backpack around Europe until it is time to go back to the States. Beautiful scenery, cute plot, lots of reminiscing about college students abroad, I hope this film comes out on DVD soon. I wish there was a soundtrack, some of the French pop versions of American rock classics are merveilleux! The biggest diappointment is the cutting of some scenes and music from the film due to copyrights etc. I especially missed LOTTA LOVE, JUST ONE LOOK, and the French version of DO YOU BELIEVE IN MAGIC? as were performed in the original screen release and HBO release. Also, after living in Paris (Montmartre) for 2 years, when I saw Marie-France's character driving around Paris in a silver American Corvette Stingray, I wondered how the heck she got that car through those narrow Parisian streets or where she bought that on a French teacher's salary? I guess that is a job for the cinemtographers and special effects crews! All in all, buy,rent or see this film if ever on cable for its wholesome cuteness, good acting, and beautiful scenes of La Belle Ville Paris! Hope the DVD is in the planning stages, my VHS tape is becoming threadbare!!",1148601600,3,3680,4.6513056835637485
1258597,4,B000035Z4H,"I first saw this film at a theater when I was in high school. I was charmed by the appeal of traveling to Europe and going to a foreign university even for a semester.  I finally had that dream come through in graduate school, but I remember when I departed that I wanted to experience some of the things that the characters in this movie felt - romance, exposure to another culture, romance, European sophistication, immersion in another culture, did I say romance? This movie in a very easy way shows how our expectations can sometimes disappoint us. But it has some very funny moments. Some of the styles are dated-typically 70's stuff, but this is charming to anyone who grew up during this time.  I was a little disappointed by the music changes in the film.  I especially missed the Kinks singing ""Superman"" in the disco scene.

  The characters in this movie are very real and likeable.  Alex is the typical non-sophisticated sophisticate that goes after the older woman.  Joel is the fumbling adolescent American who somehow finds love in Paris.  Laura is the character with a list of things to do while in France, and a boyfriend back home - who ultimately is disappointed with being so fixed on her tasks that she doesn't enjoy them.  Toni is Joel's love interest in Paris, who managed to strike a chord with most 18 year old boys who watched the film in the 1970's.

  I watch this movie every once in a while because it brings back many memories, and even when I went to Europe some of these characters were still there. Perhaps it is the universal appeal of romance, and being abroad that makes this film work, but it does.  If the film is ever released with the original soundtrack I know I would buy it.  Everytime I hear the songs today, they remind me of the film.  So from a nostalgic view I highly recommend this movie to anyone who has seen it during the 70's.  To anyone who has not, take a peek, and if you are planning on going overseas to school, enjoy it and think that maybe some of these things could happen to you.",1140912000,,2042,4.460916442048518

1258599,3,B000035Z4H,"I saw this in the theatre when it first came out.  A fun film.

I bought the VHS, & it's still fun.  However, there is a LOT missing: several musical items [""Do You Believe in Magic"" - in French, in the opening scene on the bus; ""Lotta Love"", as noted in another review; ""Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow"" - in the scene with Mme. Tessier dancing w/ Alex at the end-of-year party] and several changed scenes.

The movie would be better ""restored"" & without deletions.  I read somewhere that there were rights issues on some of the songs, and that some of the actors were not eager for this film to be released on video.  The movie is remarkable for the pre-fame appearances of some actors and actreesses, as others have mentioned.

Buy the video, but if you somehow get a chance to see the actual film, I think you'll like the film better.",1106611200,22,838,4.367741935483871
1258600,5,B000035Z4H,"I bought this video on a lark, having remembered it from 1980 on HBO (as many other reviewers did).  The movie was even better than I remembered because I was only 10 in 1980 and couldn't really appreciate all the situations the characters were going through.  Watching the movie now, I found myself relating to all three of the main characters at some point or another in the movie.  Joel is sheltered and needs some nudging to get out into the world.  Alex is a dreamer and a free spirit.  Lora is rigid about what she plans to do and gets bent out of shape when things don't go exactly as planned.  It's a great delight watching these three on their adventures through France.  One of the last scenes of the movie, where Joel says goodbye to Alex and asks him to keep in touch, is quite touching and reminded me of the various people who I've met in my life who went away for whatever reason.  Goodbyes are sometimes sad but you appreciate the time you spent together.

Another reviewer mentioned that the scene in the original version with ""Lotta Love"" by Nicolette Larson had the song removed for the video version.  I don't remember ""Lotta Love"" in the original version, but I do distinctly remember that ""Just One Look"" by Linda Ronstadt was played in the scene where Alex stalks Madame Tessier in the clothing store.  That song was changed to some other French pop song.  However, unlike with the ""Lotta Love"" change, I feel this change takes away from the original... ""Just One Look"" is definitely appropriate for the scene, so you lose something in the new version.

Still I loved the movie... another thing that is different for me now is that I find Alex (David Marshall Grant) to be completely adorable!  His wide-eyed, eager beaver character is very charming.  Ahhh!

If you want to see a cute, light hearted romantic comedy, and want to be taken back to your young adulthood or the time when you first ventured from your hometown to a completely new environment, you will love this movie.",1092528000,4,2003,4.584269662921348

7916780,4,B000035Z4H,"OK, I doubt it was ever nominated for any major awards, but it's a nice way to spend an hour and half.  Great sound track, which has mostly been restored.  Apparently there were major royalty issues.  The main characters are likable.  The story is just OK.  The scenery is cool.  I first saw this when it was released and fell hopelessly in love with Valerie Quennessin.  My wife said it was OK as I would never meet her.  Falling in love with one of her friends was totally forbidden!  Valerie appeared in ""Summer Lovers"" and  again totally capitalized me.  Her talents were totally wasted in one of the Conan movies as a princess who's only contribution was to scream while tied up  What a sin on the part of the director and producer!  I believe those are the only films she made that have been released in the US.  She made a number of French-language movies, but I haven't been able to find one.  Bummer!",1485648000,3,909,4.424242424242424

7916783,5,B000035Z4H,Don't think this is just for those of us who saw it in 1979 - this actually still holds up following a group of American students having an academic year in France. Fun to see actors you know in what probably is their first film as well as the two French stars that already have their careers. It was so enjoyable to see again and to share with people who had never seen it.,1478044800,,374,4.0675675675675675

7916786,5,B000035Z4H,"I loved this movie from the very first time that I saw it!  But I noticed that there were some scenes that were altered and music substitutions......even the movie's ending credits seemed to have been changed for some reason.  I first bought the movie on VHS, then on DVD with different packaging than what is shown here.  Because I liked the movie so much, I'd been searching for a version WITHOUT the scene deletions and musical changes.......and here it it on blu-ray at last!  The casting is excellent and features Debra Winger and Mandy Patinkin in supporting roles before they became the big stars that we now know them to be. I don't want to unduly spoil the plot of the movie for those who haven't seen it or who may be sitting on the fence about whether to purchase it or not.  Except to say that it's about a group of college age students who are studying in Paris for a year, many of whom are at the  they learn a lot about life both in and out of the classroom.",1472947200,4,973,4.318681318681318
7916787,3,B000035Z4H,"It's funny how your tastes change when you age.  I really loved this movie when it was first released.  The music great, the cast funny, the late Marie France Pisier was gorgeous.

I was happy to see this movie released finally and eagerly watched it... And was disappointed.  The transfer is okay (the film is old and source elements would be limited).  The film has not aged well, the plot is obviously dated and childish.  I guess I have grown up and the film hasn't...",1467158400,,472,4.4941176470588236
7916788,5,B000035Z4H,Very happy to confirm that the new Blu-ray edition of French Postcards restores the original soundtrack from when this movie was first released. It makes a big difference in the enjoyment of this film - the reason I chose this edition over the digital HD streaming version.,1466380800,7,273,4.829787234042553
