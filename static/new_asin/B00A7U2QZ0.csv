At the end of season 5 Jeffrey Geiger returned for full-time duty and fired half the main cast as a result. So for no good reason the series lost fine actors like Jayne Brook, Vondie Curtis-Hall (despite his terrible Whoopi Goldberg new hair style) and Peter Berg.
So let me get this straight , these excellent actors are shown the door but  creepy hospital skirt chaser Adam Arkin gets to stay on the show - how does that even work !
And just who are these actors replaced by ?
3 Bimbos !!!
The truly terrible Carla fetus-faced Gugino.
 Barbera ""Love that Joker !"" Hershey.
 Lauren (I have no credibility as an actress whatsoever) Holly.
Who all should equally share the award for ""Most Unconvincing Performance as a Doctor in Television History""  !
But hey, they look good so I guess that's what really counts right ?
As for Geiger himself, one wonders why Mandy Patinkin even bothered coming back to the series when he's absent for more than half of it - having dissapeared from the storylines altogether by the time the series chokes out its final death rattle.
The fault for all of this mess clearly lies with creator David E. Kelley who abandoned his onscreen child early on - a blow from which the series never fully recovered - only to half-heartedly return at the end just to hammer in the final nails by ruining the series once and for all with his disastrous cast changes !
Even more, just to make sure the series is truly dead and buried some idiot goes and decimates the opening theme music into some eardrum shattering  tinny noise whose only purpose is to send the viewer deaf before each episode even starts !
All in all an abysmal end to what originally started off as one of the best medical series on tv and a series that easily could've given ER a serious run for its money -  if only it's creator and leading man had cared enough about the show to bother sticking around for its entire 6 year run !",1467936000,,2052,4.458666666666667
8548011,5,B00A7U2QZ0,"It got beat out in the ratings game by ER, but this was a brilliant hospital drama. Slower paced, because it does not spend all its time in the emergency room, which in a big city hospital can be wild and crazy and dangerous (my husband was a doctor and did his share of on-call in ERs in Louisiana and New York City, and came home to tell me the stories). But the actors' chemistry was excellent,  and the stories were for the most part believable and medically sound. It was a great show, and I am glad it is finally out on DVD.",1460505600,,530,4.096153846153846
