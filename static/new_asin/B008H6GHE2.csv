5162398,5,B008H6GHE2,"I saw this play in the theater and enjoyed it.  Excellent cast, sets, everything.  The acting was first rate as is the interpretation of Shakespear's play.  Yet, the biggest surprise was the interview/Q&A session at the conclusion.  For this reason, I could not wait to get the work on DVD.  I have watched the entire DVD through a number of times and just the interview session a few more.  Highly recommended.",1369612800,5,411,4.71830985915493
5162399,5,B008H6GHE2,"The first thing you will notice is that you can hear every word and very clearly. If you pull out the book you will notice that this may be an adaptation but it closely follows the written play.  Pay attention to the epilog. You will be spell stopped.

In case you missed this story:
Prospero, once the Duke of Milan and sorcerer now reigns over a faraway island, living there with his daughter, Miranda. After 12 years of being abandoned he has an opportunity for revenge. However the ships may bring more than he planned on.

Shakespeare, Stratford, Christopher Plummer will stand as a favorite.

I have various versions of the play and the obscure ""Prospero's Books"" (1991), even ""Forbidden Planet"".

5162400,5,B008H6GHE2,This version of The Tempest is a film of a stage production. It follows the text of the play very closely and the acting is solid. I found the audience a bit annoying --they laugh too much-- and the actor's interpretation of the characters is solid. Despite the fact that the play is performed on a mostly empty stage (true to Shakespeare's productions at the Globe) it is an engaging production.,1367539200,4,396,4.591549295774648
5162401,4,B008H6GHE2,"My actual score is 88/100, but I cannot give this five stars because the play is not top tier Shakespeare. The meeting of protagonist and antagonist is lame.

Everything else is perfect.

The panel discussion that is included on the DVD is very good.

5162402,5,B008H6GHE2,"I fell in love with Shakespeare back in the '60's when my now deceased mother first took me to Stratford, Ontario to see ""King Lear"" ( reward for getting a B in arithmetic instead of my usual C).  That exquisite little theater and the excellent actors overcame my childish unfamiliarity with Shakespeare's language and showed me the magic of live theater.

I was totally thrilled to come across this disk at Blockbuster (!) and watched it with my spouse, whose affinity for literature
is far less intense than mine.  But we were both spellbound by this production, and I've bought this disc since for us and another for my brother, who also was enthralled, much to his surprise and delight.

Shakespeare, Stratford, CHRISTOPHER PLUMMER!!!  Pure magic, start to finish.",1364169600,10,768,4.922480620155039
5162403,5,B008H6GHE2,"I saw this on June 14, 2012, during one of those special event broadcasts into movie theaters. I've seen the DVD of Julie Taymor's film version several times and I can't choose a favorite, so I recommend both! The Stratford production captures the excitement of live theatre but the Hawaiian locations in Taymor's film are so beautiful and exotic.

I've also seen the story of Prospero as interpreted in the Metropolitan Opera Live in HD broadcasts of ""The Enchanted Island"" in January 2012, and composer Thomas Ades conducting his version of ""The Tempest"" starring Simon Keenlyside in November 2012.

PS: I can't find subtitles on the Stratford DVD, but closed captioning is available -- I just accessed the appropriate menu using my TV remote instead of the DVD player's remote. This trick has worked on quite a few DVDs that lacked subtitles.",1361059200,9,845,4.943661971830986
5162404,5,B008H6GHE2,"I had the good fortune to see this very production at Stratford, Ontario, and this video does a wonderful job capturing the feel of the live performance. It was magical on the night: Plummer is outstanding in a difficult role, Caliban pitched just right, the masque of Ceres breathtaking, and the lords a strong supporting cast. I've seen several stage adaptations of this play, and this exceeds them all. I'm delighted to be able to own it on DVD.",1354665600,52,448,4.6835443037974684
5162405,5,B008H6GHE2,"Just hoping you've noticed that lots of these reviews are for another dvd altogether -  Julie Taymor's film starring Helen Mirren. Amazon really needs a policy for differentiating between different releases of the same movie, and different movies with the same title, as this problem arises all the time.",1348617600,64,304,5.204081632653061

5162407,4,B008H6GHE2,This is an excellant film of an on stage production of the play. The adting and direction were  faithful to Shakespeare's play.,1395014400,3,127,4.7727272727272725
5162408,5,B008H6GHE2,"...check out this excellent theatrical production of THE TEMPEST. Though filmed on stage in front of a live audience, it also has a cinematic quality. Very rewarding evening at the theater without having to get out of bed.",1394668800,3,222,4.868421052631579
5162409,5,B008H6GHE2,"The Tempest is a difficult play to stage because of all its effects: natural (storm at sea) and supernatural (Ariel, Prospero's creations). That's why I prefer movie versions (pace William!), but the staged version of the Stratford Shakespeare Festival with Christopher Plummer under the direction of Des McAnuff deals with these difficulties beautifully. It comes as no surprise that  Mr. Plummer delivers a fine Prospero. Particularly good are the portrayals of Ariel by Julyana Soetistyo and Caliban by Dion Johnstone.",1393891200,9,521,5.5125
5162410,5,B008H6GHE2,"Bardolators often think of this play as Shakespeare's farewell to the stage, with Duke Prospero as the playwright's stand-in.  Shakespeare could do worse than Christopher Plummer (Capt Von Trapp) as his alter ego.  Prospero is the focus in every production, but often Caliban the ""monster"" or the lovers Miranda and Ferdinand share second billing.  In this production the central pair is not the two young lovers, or the contrasted spirits Caliban and Ariel, but the master-servant relationship between the exiled duke and his obedient minion.  It will be difficult to find a more moving version of the relationship of Prospero with his fairy-servant Ariel than what is depicted in this film.  Shakespeare's language is spoken clearly and understandably by the entire cast.  The often curtailed wedding masque with ethereal spirits is here presented by diaphanously garbed goddesses projected onto the stage.  Plummer's lifetime of work on the stage in Canadian Shakespeare productions, as well as in film, is apparent in this filmed version of a stage production at Stratford Ontario in 2010.",1391904000,3,1093,5.319767441860465
5162411,5,B008H6GHE2,"I caught this performance playing at a local movie theatre a few months ago and both I and my wife (who's not big on Shakespeare) loved it.  When I saw it was available for purchase, I didn't hesitate buying it.  This is Shakespeare at its best.  Christopher Plummer, who I believe is about 80 years old when he did this, is absolutely incredible!  I had no idea he was such a great actor (certainly not from the mugging he does in Sound of Music).  If you are fervently or even mildly into Shakespeare, this is a must-have!",1388707200,3,524,4.360824742268041
5162412,5,B008H6GHE2,"If you are a theatre buff, don't miss this great production.
Christopher Plummer is at his best in this most difficult of all Shakespearian roles.
The cast is great and the production gave you the feeling that you were sitting in the audience.",1383264000,,243,4.674418604651163
5162413,5,B008H6GHE2,It was wonderful. With Shakespeare sometimes it is difficult to hear or understand the dialogue.  This came through so clearly.  Christopher Plummer enuciated so carefully that I wasn't frustrated in attempting to figure out what was said.  A wonderful rendition of Shakespeare's the Tempest.,1377820800,,292,5.590909090909091
5162414,5,B008H6GHE2,"Superb performances by everyone, but especially by Plummer. Not to be missed by anyone who loves Shakespeare. There is a long q&a after the performance in the theater with Plummer and the director.",1376784000,,197,5.0
5162415,5,B008H6GHE2,"Masterful. An absolute delight. Christopher Plummer is a wonder to watch.
...incomparable...
Christopher Plummer is a master of the English language. He leads the audience through this narrative as artfully as Prospero.",1370390400,11,219,5.875
8527970,5,B008H6GHE2,"Overall this is the best version of The Tempest on DVD at the moment, The Helen Mirren film is quite fine and appealing to students, but it's a film.  Although I haven't seen the DVD of the new RSC version with Simon Russell Beale, I saw the Barbican production and still think this is better. Beale is a wonderful actor and that production has amazing electronic effects, but the simplicity and clarity of this version and the authority of Plummer's Prospero makes this a winner for me, even over the Globe DVD and Michael Hordern's superb Propsero in the otherwise cheesy old BBC version.",1524614400,,590,4.673076923076923

8527972,4,B008H6GHE2,"Beautiful production, Prospero was meh, but Ariel was great, with a strong other supporting cast, so definitely worth a watch.",1440979200,,126,5.35
8527973,3,B008H6GHE2,"I believed I studied William Shakespeare's Comedies including ""The Tempest"" at Rutgers by Professor Ron Levao in the nineties. As an English major, you are required a Shakespeare course. I have never seen a production of this play before. Christopher Plummer is obviously a great Shakespearean classical actor from training and experience. His Prospero commands the stage in this production.

This is a taped version of an actual live production in Stratford, Ontario, Canada where they have world renowned William Shakespeare Theatre Company. The stage is actually smaller than it appears. Prospero is surrounded by his daughter, Miranda; his blue angel spirit Ariel; and Caliban.

I most enjoyed Ariel in this production. The actress seemed to relish the role even with blue make-up and costume. Caliban's costume is a bit disturbing.

If I have a complaint, I wished they included more information about the play, William Shakespeare, Stratford Theatre Festival, and more. You will only get the play and nothing else. If you are not familiar with Shakespeare, you will get lost and confused in viewing it.",1435622400,,1108,5.248587570621469
8527974,5,B008H6GHE2,"I revfere Shakespeare's THE TEMPEST. It is a work of art apart from all others, including his own! I always saw it as a play of reconciliation of people in conflict, of human beings to their tragic fate, of the older and younger generations, of - well, you get my drift: THE TEMPEST can be what you make of it, and Shakespeare's plenitude will hardly be diminished.
What I admire about this production is that its artistic goal, fully realized, is to be a play performed as live theater. It is not puffed up with special effects, but allows Shakespeare's language and theater genius to reign supreme. And that is a cup continually overflowing! I admire the natural charm and authority of Christopher Plummer's performance, and his generosity toward his fellow actors. This is no star turn; this is great acting. The settings and costumes seem to emphasize an
 untamed wilderness, showing Prospero has NOT colonized the island. Recent stagings that present the play as proto-imperialism may be provocative but they necessarily downplay the Renaissance emphases on magic, art vs. culture, political responsibility, family love - these are Shakespeare's themes, drawn from his 16th century world, and more than sufficient for our contemplation. This production will give you that quiet space in which to contemplate the fate of a man who realizes he must stop playing god and once again become a human being among his kind. ""I would, were I human,"" Ariel says to him toward the end, and Prospero is convinced he must change his  life to match Ariel's simple, profound perception. That is Shakespeare's wisdom.",1432080000,7,1606,4.9888059701492535
