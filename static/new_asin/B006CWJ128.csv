8496656,4,B006CWJ128,"Think three stooges, only doubled.  The Crazy Gang was composed of three successful double acts which sometimes came together as one six-man madhouse.  In this case, the gang is the crew of one of the barrage balloons protecting London from low flying aircraft.  To pass the time and make a little money, they are also using it to advertise their lunch wagon, to which it is attached.  Just as the brass are about to lower the boom on them, a gale lifts them and their lunch wagon across the channel to occupied France, where they are promptly picked up and imprisoned by the Nazis.  They learn that a former prisoner of the camp was working on a secret weapon which would get them home, but they don't know where he is.
A Gestapo officer visits the camp looking for look-alikes for Hitler and his staff.  They will be killed in an assasination plot, and then the real Hitler et al will rise up as miraculous survivors.  This gets the gang out of camp.  To the frustration of the Gestapo, every time they try to kill the doubles, something goes wrong.  Eventually they stumble across the secret device and get home.
Again, think a British version of the Three Stooges and you will have a general idea of what this is like.",1455408000,,1222,4.493212669683258

The opening has the gang using a barrage balloon (used to deter low flying aircraft attached to a mobile fish and chips shop.  Just as the authorities are about to shut them down, a storm comes along and lifts the balloon and its occupants across the Channel where they are captured and thrown into a POW camp  Fortunately for them, there is a Gestapo plot to create doubles of Hitler and his staff, assassinate them,  The Gang is drafted into this scheme as the doubles, but, out of sheer luck, the assassination attempts constantly fail.  Eventually they discover a secret device which allows them to escape back to Britain.  oduc
Fast paced, budget production values, good routines, though familiarity with British accents other than the posh Oxford accent are useful in following the dialogue.",1451779200,,1029,4.885057471264368
