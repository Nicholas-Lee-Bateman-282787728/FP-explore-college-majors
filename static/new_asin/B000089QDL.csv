7980752,1,B000089QDL,"You may find ""Enemy Gold"" on several Andy Sidaris multi-movie sets, but don't be deceived by this little atrocity (and do not even think of paying for the single-DVD edition). Although the film stars some actors that Sidaris fans will be familiar with, particularly Bruce Penhall as Chris Cannon and Julie Strain as Jewel Panther (seriously), this film does have at least three Sidaris family members in the credits, but is directed by Andy's son Drew. Now, I would ordinarily be inclined to give Drew a bit of a break as younger filmmaker, but I found the finished product to be a nearly unwatchable morass about a number of divergent things.

The film opens ominously with a bunch of Civil War re-enactors in a heated battle and a story about a Confederate mission behind Northern lines to steal their gold. Did the survivor of the gold hide it in the woods where it's been lost for the last 150 years? If you insist on knowing the answer, watch on. Once that premise is put forward we switch to secret agent Becky Midnite (Suzi Simpson), who, like most of the ""thespians"" here was hired more for her looks than her acting ability. She meets up with two other agents in an astonishingly improbable way, and even less probably one of the agents is Chris Cannon, her ex-boyfriend: Penhall is definitely the best actor here, but even he can't sell the wildly careening plotpoints. While that backstory is being generated, there's a shootout involving a Bolivian drug kingpin, Santiago (Rodrigo Obregon, who is another Sidaris regular, but this is not one of his stronger efforts), and a turf war develops between the agent's supervisor, Dickson (Alan Abelew), and their Washington leader Ava Noble (Tai Collins). While I'm discussing guns, here's a personal safety tip: do not tuck your machine gun into the waistband of your pants. That's just unwise. Given what I've told you I'm sure I'm not spoiling the plot to reveal Dickson is on Santiago's payroll, and gives him a communicator device to let him and his team of assassins track the three good guys, Cannon, Midnite, and sidekick Mark Austin (Mark Barriere). Of course there's a Jacuzzi scene and shortly thereafter we learn Ava is a hot blonde too; obviously there's rekindled romance and some lame dancing before the plot soldiers on. Dickson is mad that the good guys broke up part of his drug ring so he suspends them and they take a vacation in the woods while waiting for Ava to get them out of trouble. Just to be on the safe side Becky brings her crossbow with explosive-tipped arrows. I wonder if that will ever get used?

Once out in the serenity of the woods Becky immediately wanders off and finds a skull and the treasure map to the gold. It was just that easy. There is a minor helicopter and boat scene, but Drew isn't quite as dynamic in the chases as his dad. Sidaris wisdom frequently insists there be two bumbling assassins, and Drew follows the template perfectly, as two buffoons disobey Santiago's orders and try to knock off the good guys without his permission. This does not go as planned, but I'm not sure what the plan was exactly, as they were sneaking up on them with guns drawn and instead of, I don't know, shooting them, the dumber one steals their ATV which makes so much noise it alerts them all. Why? Oh yeah, to get the guys to chase him on their motorcycles while Becky towels off after showering. While this may be the dumbest chase ever filmed, it results in an even more amazing coincidence: the ATV thief is killed when he runs into a branch with his empty noggin. The branch is attached to the tree that has the gold buried under it. What luck! Becky dispatches the other moron with her crossbow while wearing a thong.

Dickson and Noble take another boat out to ""rescue"" the three good guys, who have found the gold and immediately run into Santiago and Panther. (The worst performance in the film, easily, is from Sidaris veteran Julie Strain. The scenery chewing is truly astounding.) While this may sound interesting, it's not: you know what's going to happen, and you know who's going to get killed, and despite the ridiculous scrum that ensues, it's pure tedium. I did like the helicopter versus crossbow scene (which was ordained the moment the crossbow was introduced and its nature and demeanor described). After getting out of the woods (most of this movie was filmed in the woods in and around Shreveport, Louisiana) the four good guys (now including Ava) head home and engage in some ""special training"", and of course that's a euphemism.

Produced in association with Medien-Beteiligungs-Gesellschaft MBH, and featuring a soundtrack populated with faux Mark Knopfler and Billy Gibbons guitar licks, the film is easier on the ears than most Sidaris films, but many Andy Sidaris fans will not find this film to their liking, and while its inclusion in Andy Sidaris sets is not overtly deceptive it is mostly just filler between better films.",1469923200,,4949,4.744483159117306

7980754,3,B000089QDL,"Being a fan of Andy Sidaris's movies, I was disappointed in this release. The story premise is okay, but the starlets were not sensationally endowed and the nudity was kept to a minimum and inserted at odd times. The locations were not appealing either.  Andy's done a lot better.",1309392000,,280,4.714285714285714
