It shares a title to one of my all time favorite films, Cannibal Holocaust, so it caught my interest. What type of Cannibal Holocaust can Satan hold for my viewing pleasure? I thought to myself while reading the description. It said something about being an ultra-gory horror film, so, even if it were low budget, I would find a way to enjoy it. Then I watched it.

The opening of the film sets the tone for the rest of the film perfectly. A poorly lit chase scene that leads into a club where a death metal band I never heard of is playing. Here, we see a girl, who is a terrible actress, kill the person she was chasing with a knife in front of a series of onlookers, but no one seems disturbed by the event happening in front of them. The kill has little to no blood, and after I saw that, I knew this was going to be rough.

While watching the film, there was not one thing that was done well. The lighting, writing, acting and directing are all terrible. There isn't one actor in the film who is accidentally good, or even somewhat decent. If there was a scene that was well shot, I completely missed it, and I watched it twice.

There is one moment where a woman knocks a pwrson out with a flashlight, and it looks like she just lightly tapped him on his head. If they played the doink sound effect, it would have fit perfectly. Then, another moment, a character says the line thats where they take them, the ones the eat. Not only is that a stupid line, but it is probably the most poorly delivered line of all time in any film, and I have seen Horno and Bucky Larson: Born to Be A Star.

Because of this, why would I watch this fulm more than once? Well, this movie was so mind blowingly awful, that i had to show my one friend. Neither of us could believe what we saw. One would assume that after seeing it once that the experience could not get worse, but somehow, the movie only got worse with the second viewing. The crappiness of this film does need to be seen to be believed. There is no film like it.",1524355200,,2093,4.186104218362283

I'm just writing this for other people who might be curious about how BAD this thing (movie) is.

It is just b#ll $""it!

There's even a sex escene but it's so bad (the fake blood seems like jelly, the acting, the ugly actors) that the hole scene is disgusting.

Belive the other review, DON'T buy this (of course I didn't do it).",1380499200,,337,4.301587301587301

Shot on video, convoluted, confusing, etc... etc... etc...

I have seen shot on video amateur efforts before that have impressed me. Not this piece of junk. Worse than any ""film student"" effort I've ever seen, this was just a waste of time even though I barely watched it.

Skip it. Seriously. Waste of time that you will regret. The only reason I took the time to write this review is because no one else has.

Stay away.",1188518400,3,576,4.256880733944954
