8600583,1,B00E3GIY7I,An amature production by someone who visited the grounds at Montecello.  Not worth fifty cents.,1477872000,,95,5.333333333333333
8600584,1,B00E3GIY7I,"This was incredibly boring.  I purchased for our family to watch in addition to our homeschool study unit. My kids range in age from 5-10, none were interested in finishing this,",1413849600,,178,4.741935483870968
8600585,1,B00E3GIY7I,Amateurish at best. Poor video and picture quality that the producer tried to make up for with the music sound track. It took a lot of work to make such a beautiful place look dull and uninviting. My wife and I were at Poplar Forrest and Monticello last weekend and were excited to see a documentary on them until the video started. I am amazed that Amazon would put an amateur video production on their site and charge for it. A truly wasted $1.99.,1407974400,,449,4.357142857142857
8600586,2,B00E3GIY7I,"This is not a professionally produced DVD. More like converted video and still shots from books. The narration is very nice, but slow and thoughtful. I bought it to share Jefferson and his home with my students, but it will just use my own collection of photos from a visit there. This video will never hold the attention of teens. Sadly, I doubt I will ever watch it again either.",1383955200,2,381,4.457142857142857
