If you love Roy, Dale and Gabby (& Trigger), you will thoroughly enjoy this.",1397347200,,254,4.478260869565218
8322623,5,B001MZVZGK,"My children absolutely love Roy Rogers.  Better example to pattern after than ""heroes"" of today.  This came in great shape and in a timely manner.  Great seller too.",1296000000,,165,4.821428571428571
8322624,5,B001MZVZGK,Many of the Roy Rogers TV episodes in other sets has terrible quality.  This is excellent.  Great buy if your a Roy Rogers fan.,1282089600,2,127,4.25
8322625,1,B001MZVZGK,"Very poor quality picture on all movies. So bad that I don't think I will be able to watch any of them. Would not want anyone else to waste their money on them. The Mill Creek multi packs have a far better picture and have most of these movies.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roy-Rogers-King-of-the-Cowboys-2-DVD-Set/dp/B001QYA7E8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roy Rogers - King of the Cowboys - 2 DVD Set</a>",1281657600,6,444,6.17741935483871
8322626,3,B001MZVZGK,You can't beat these Roy Rogers classics-'Sheriff Of Tombstone' is one of the best westerns ever- and the tin is excellent but the prints of these movies are dreadful-they have been hacked off at the top probably to fit the TV screenings in the 50s-those guys who did that should have been shot by Roy- I would gladly have paid $50 plus for good prints of these movies. Guess I'll have to wait until better prints come along and stuff them in the tin!,1240099200,26,451,4.380952380952381
8322627,2,B001MZVZGK,"The best thing that can be said about this set is the colorful, fancy tin, storage case that it comes in. The quality of the movie entries is very poor, it appears they projected it on a white sheet, and then filmed it with a video camera. The television episodes, while still leaving a lot to be desired, are much better, acceptable you might say, but, as the old saying goes, You get what you pay for.",1238544000,23,403,4.246753246753247
