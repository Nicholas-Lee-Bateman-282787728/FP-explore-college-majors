8111409,5,B000EMGIVE,"I love the story, but it is not translated into English to read - so I have to rely on the TV series.

No matter how many times I watch the film, I always see new plot details.

Really great fun and super acting - it has no Western drama to match it.",1388102400,,250,3.69811320754717
8111410,4,B000EMGIVE,"Vol 3 Disc 1 is about the main character's imprisonment and how he begins to mature. Here we're finding out more and more about the real colors of the Righteous parties (are they really righteous?) and Linghu's affection toward the Holy Lady. Vol 3 Disc 2 tells us more about Linghu's Master and some of the righteous parties are beginning to see Linghu's chivalry.

this series had never disappoint me since Vol. 1. From my previous review, the only slight problem was the subtitles. It has a few grammar mistakes, some lines appear too fast, and sometimes delayed.",1266796800,,566,4.775510204081633
