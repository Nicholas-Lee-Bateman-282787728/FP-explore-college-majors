8198409,1,B000R2K3VM,"""Team Mates"" is your typical '70's high-school genre bad movie.  I knew this was a bad movie going in, but I only bought it for sentimental reasons.  I dated the ""star"", Max Goff, a few times, and wanted a memento.  I'd actually already seen it WITH him, and HE even knows the movie is bad!  Although Max never made it big in Hollywood (he was on a couple of daytime soap operas for awhile, and did some off-Broadway shows), see if you can pick out James Spader, most recently the star in the fantastic Boston Legal TV series, now in re-runs.  I think Max told me this was one, if not the first, of James' first acting jobs, too.  There are also a couple of cameo scenes by a couple of ""B"" TV actors (Lou Ferrigno being one)... and those actors you see occasionally in bit parts, but can never remember their names.

If you like bad acting and bad plots, this movie is for you!  (Hope things are going well for you, Max!)",1253664000,4,921,4.252873563218391
