1788769,3,B00006RCMW,"This is a taped version of the play performed in Central Park.  I've watched many filmed plays and I was expecting the limitations and problems that come with any play taped under these circumstances - low quality sound, limited camera angles.
What I didn't expect was that the principals would be shot from the back much of the time.  I think I saw Rex Smith's back side more than his face!  In several of the production numbers, the only close-up camera is one at the rear and side of the stage, so you can't see faces at all.  I've seen other Broadway Archive tapes and they don't have these problems.  It's disappointing because despite the camera limitations, the performance has a lot of energy and fun that even the movie version lacks.  If they'd only used the camera at the front of the stage more often!",1041465600,12,813,4.534246575342466
1788770,5,B00006RCMW,"This production, though poor in terms of a/v, is intimate and otherwise outstanding.  It differs from the movie in that you get to see the entire production (the movie cuts out a few songs) and see how ""Pirates"" appeared in its formative days before the sensation reached its peak.
I own both versions (movie on VHS*), so offer the following observations:
- While the movie is extraordinarily choreographed and polished, the live show is more intimate in its own rough-cut way. Observe how the dialog seems fresher or sometimes less familiar to the cast than in the movie.
- The live show to me feels somewhat like a prequel or ""before they were famous""; it's a logical addition to the collection.
- The live production should _not_ be regarded as abysmal due to technical shortcomings; I will watch it before I watch the movie again.
Like most who have posted here, I was disappointed that the live production wasn't remastered or retouched in any perceivable way.  It appears to have been recorded on vintage home video equipment.  But that doesn't detract from the entertainment value.  If you have any affection for the cast this is definitely worth owning.
* We need to petition MCA/Universal to release the movie on DVD, along with the outtakes, interviews, etc.",1041033600,16,1268,4.856481481481482
1788771,5,B00006RCMW,"This is a really cool performance of a really funny operetta. The plot is a killer, and Kevin Kline rules as the Pirate King....",1040342400,5,128,4.375
1788772,1,B00006RCMW,"I wish I would have read through the reviews BEFORE I bought this.  When I was young, my family had a movie version of this with the same actors, so when I saw ""The Priates of Penzance"" with Keven Kline, Linda Ronstadt and Rex Smith, I thought ""great"" and just bought it.  WRONG!  It wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't so obvious that it came from an analog source.  Have you ever watched a video tape so many times that it jumps and hiccups and the picture gets all fuzzy and the sound gets all muffled?  Well, they didn't even TRY to remaster it - they just copied it to disc.  If you're going to buy this version, GET VHS - save yourself the couple of extra dollars - it's not worth it.
PS the version that I had as a kid had Angela Lansbury, this one does not.",1039824000,14,761,4.04
1788773,1,B00006RCMW,"I do not regularly post my opinion for public review, but I felt it necessary in this case.  There is some confusion between this version of Pirates of Penzance (a live performance in NYC Central Park) and the filmed version which includes many of the same principals.  I don't mean to sound preachy but some people may purchase this version thinking it is the movie version and come away disappointed.  Be warned, this version was recorded live and in an outdoor setting.  The lighting, sound, and camera work are of decidedly inferior quality.  If you are seeking to experience this without paying the 20 odd dollars, borrow your parents (or grandparents) Sony Walkman, pop in the Gilbert and Sullivan casette tape, with two nearly dead batteries and lock yourself in a dark closet with a swaying 100 watt bulb.  It is nearly as pleasant, though not quite.  It is my sincere hope that I can find someone who may be interested to have this DVD, but more likely than not it will end up in some local thrift shop.  I will be looking forward to the impending release of the movie version on DVD.",1039392000,21,1093,4.597938144329897
1788774,2,B00006RCMW,"I ordered this DVD in haste, failing to notice that it is NOT the movie version I loved so well.  My first clue should have been that it listed Patricia Routledge instead of Angela Lansbury in the cast.  Overall the performance was fine, but the quality of the recording is abominable.  Why is this Shakespeare in the Park production being marketed instead of the Hollywood version?  The colors are washed out, and at times the sound is indistinct.  I can only assume that the movie version of the same production is not available on DVD yet; otherwise, why would they market this grossly inferior production.  George Rose, Tony Azito, Rex Smith, and Kevin Kline are outstanding in their performances, as they are in the movie.  Routledge is ""so-so"".  Linda Ronstadt is terrible.  Her voice is flawed with warbling and mumbling that makes the libretto almost impossible to distinguish.  The only song she performs which I understood was a puzzling rendition of ""Heavy the Sorrow"" from ""HMS Pinafore"".  What is THAT doing in ""Pirates""??  I can only assume that she possessed it in her high school repertoire and had begged the producers to let her sing it.  Yes, I was rather disappointed with this.",1036195200,31,1198,4.842364532019705

1788814,5,B00006RCMW,"This is the original Broadway musical based on Gilbert and Sullivan's operetta Pirates of Penzance, and it is mostly faithful to the operetta. There are at least two songs added from other G&S operettas (HMS Pinafore and Ruddigore), and a very whimsical Elvis impersonation by Rex Smith near the end of the first act. The movie that came out later had Angela Lansbury as Ruth, but this Broadway rendition has Patricia Routledge in that role. I love them both.",1385769600,,459,4.822784810126582

1788816,1,B00006RCMW,I think Pirates of Penzance is a good musical  but this version it appeared as though this was filmed by an amateur in the audience.

1788817,5,B00006RCMW,"I adore Angela Lansbury, but see this version with Patricia Routledge (Hyacinth in ""Keeping Up Appearances,"" though you'd never recognize her from that).  The late great Tony Azito's dancing is seen to best advantage here.  Plus I do love the Delacorte Theater.  As for Kevin Kline:  Simply the best.  And he's still got it at 65, as proven by a one-night-only benefit stage performance of ""Pirates"" in Central Park this past summer.",1381795200,2,433,4.958333333333333
1788818,5,B00006RCMW,"O.K, up front I'd like to say that I am a huge Linda Ronstadt fan. You will enjoy this show more if you are a fan of any of the actors, or of the show in general. If not, you will likely be disappointed.
  The pros: It's Linda Ronstadt!!!! Nuff said!
  >The rough filming job makes it all seem more real, like you are there watching it.
  >Seeing the wind in their hair (since all of the scenes are set out doors) lends a feeling of authenticity.
  > The live singing is so much more enjoyable than the lip syncing in the movie version from 1983.
  > The story just plays better shot live. The 1983 movie just seems so over the top corny. it's not meant to be a movie, it's should only be shown in front of a live audience.
  The Cons:> During the beginning of the brilliantly choreographed dance scene of Tony Azito, the camera isn't even on him, and never quite gets the shot centered properly, a shame.
  > Poor sound and video
  > A really corny story. If I wasn't a Linda fan, I'd likely not have liked this very much. I gave it a 5, cause I'm a fan. If I wasn't, i'd likely have given it two or three stars.",1381363200,,1113,4.059907834101383

1788830,5,B00006RCMW,"Having read other purchasers' reviews, I knew what to expect so I was not disappointed that the video and audio was not up to current standards. Having been filmed in 1980 or so, pre-digital age, how could it be? For me it was an excellent production given the standards of the time. I am familiar with, and have loved, the movie version, but, having watched this live performance version several times, I find I actually prefer it. The movie can't convey the energy of the actors as they respond to the audience's reactions to their performances. It couldn't capture the thrill of show stopping performances. In this version, I enjoyed seeing the orchestra working in the pit to support the actors and the interaction of the conductor with the cast. The ""sword fight"" between the Pirate King and the conductor was clever and was incorporated into end of the movie version. The choreography was a joy to watch in both productions. This version is truer to the original Gilbert and Sullivan work. The movie version added music in G&S style, but the added music was more a detriment than an enhancement.",1373241600,4,1101,4.769633507853404

1788833,5,B00006RCMW,"I have the movie version of the play on dvd as well as this one, and they are both well worth owning!  The movie version is wonderful in its own right, and I love Angela Lansbury, but this being the original Broadway show gives it a bit of something extra.  It actually has several scenes that were removed from the movie version which are cute, and certainly don't hurt, especially the ones showcasing the talent (and incredible good looks) of Rex Smith.

Bottom line: if you're a fan of the movie, you'll love this dvd!",1360713600,2,521,4.463157894736842
1788834,5,B00006RCMW,"As a lifelong theatergoer, I find to much to love here. I own this and several other Broadway Theater Archive DVDs.  They are not the best technically, but for live theater enjoyment and big name actors, they are wonderful. Linda Ronstadt's voice does lack the range she needs for operetta, but Kevin Kline is the most entertaining Pirate King I've ever seen both in this production and in the movie -- and I've seen a great many productions of this show, including the famous D'oyly Carte company.

Patricia Routledge, George Rose, and Tony Azito are excellent as Ruth, the Major General, and the Police Sargent.  Rex Smith was most enjoyable as Frederic.

I am so happy I own this DVD and have watched it many times.",1356480000,2,718,4.674603174603175
1788835,4,B00006RCMW,"I continue to watch this Pirates of Penzance, even if the voices are ....well.....ok.  It is funny, it is raucous, and I think that at least WS Gilbert would have loved it.  I have showed it to British upper crusts who have lived most of their life in Africa, and they love it.  Whenever the ""movie"" night occurs, we frequently haul this rendition of Pirates out.  The fact that the DVD is of a live performance makes it even better, and that the set is Central Park, even better. The amount of energy that Kevin Kline expends throughout the show is absolutely incredible.  The best scenes are with the choruses, not surprisingly because Pirates is a chorus show. Particularly the whole second act ""Foeman Bears His Steel--Go Ye Heroes---With Catlike Tread"" scene cannot be beaten.  But, the Paradox song is equally good and fun.  The energy in the performance makes up for the voices.",1354924800,,885,4.707792207792208
1788836,4,B00006RCMW,"I pretty much agree with many of the reviewers - video and audio quality are so-so (but quite listenable) and the sense of fun and excitement in the performance is definitely greater than in the movie version.  For me, this is the Kevin Kline version to own.  However, I am also a fan of the more traditional performance style and so this is not the ONLY performance I would want to enjoy.",1351728000,,389,4.388888888888889
1788837,3,B00006RCMW,"And sing very well, Patricia Routledge does in the role of Ruth, the Piratical-Maid-of-All-Work.

This 1980 production, performed with enthusiasm, is actually very difficult to rate, because it varies between delightful and just plain awful. I think the easiest way to explain it is with Amazon's star method, beginning with five ***** & working my way down to one *.

*****  Kevin Kline, as the Pirate King, commands the stage, and even though his voice is not always in top form (The fault may be the sound recording, which is just plain awful.), he is very funny. He moves lithely, as a Pirate King should, and his comic timing is perfect.
***** ""With Catlike Tread/Come friends and plough the sea!"" is a knockout! One wants to join the audience in stand-up applause.
***** Major General Stanley's patter song, ""I am the very model of a modern major general"" is splendid (although I didn't care for his rather nasal ""Orphan boy"" rendition).

**** Patricia Routledge portrays a believable 47-year old ex-nursery maid, who, hard of hearing, has apprenticed young Frederick, not to a pilot, but to a pirate.

*** 1/2: Linda Rondstadt portrays an engaging Mabel, when she is singing with her light soprano 'head' voice, and resists the temptation to belt it out (as in ""Go ye heroes, go to glory"" in act two); her Donizetti-like staccato with the flute in ""Poor Wandering One"" is really quite pleasant; and she also looks as if she has stepped out of a sentimental Victorian painting.

** The screeching female chorus is appalling.
** Frederic looks and acts the part of a twenty-one year old (little boy of five), but much of the time his voice emerges as little more than a breathy croon.

*  The policemen are extremely unfunny. The roles have to be played straight to be comical (The whole point of 'tarantara' is that they are supposed to be stoney-faced Constable Plods who put on a brave front. Instead, they persistently mince around the stage like demented imitations of of Charlie Chaplin).
* The ghastly 'orchestra' (Flute, bass guitar, trumpet, xylophone?); Sir Arthur Sullivan must be spinning in his grave.
* The singers' diction (Major-General excepted) is often incomprehensible, so that Gilbert's scintillating words are lost (He's spinning too!).

The biggest problem with this DVD is the mono-sound. It is difficult to tell whether the vocal imperfections are the faults of the singers or of the 1980 recording.

I have a feeling that this production must have been a barrel of fun when it was performed live. Unfortunately, this DVD, which has no subtitles or even a menu, gives us only a few suggestions of the enjoyment.",1338854400,,2641,4.888143176733781
1788838,4,B00006RCMW,"This DVD was filmed outside and the quality of the film is not good, however, I knew that when I ordered it because I had rented a copy.

1788839,4,B00006RCMW,I ordered this along with the movie. I think I enjoyed watching this version the best. You got the feel of a actual stage production.

I would suggest this version as it was a real treat to watch. Had to add it to my REX SMITH collection.,1330128000,,405,4.012345679012346

Don't believe the pettyfogging and nitpicking gripes from others about iffy colour balance and less-than-digital audio quality.  For goodness sake, this was shot 'live' after minimal camera rehearsal time on analogue Edicons fed to a veteran outside-broadcast truck with pictures and audio captured on-the-fly by a production team that was in that long-gone era at top of its game.

The staging and technical presentation of this show on the night was world-class. And the performers - soloists, chorus and orchestra - breathtaking.  The TV capture, despite the technical limitations of picture and sound quality prevailing at that time, was first rate.  The DVD presentation is worth every penny of the asking price and far more satisfying artistically than the 'official' recording.

She is the best Ruth I have ever seen.  (and I have seen/own pretty much every recorded version available in the US).
I wish she had done the movie version instead of Angela Lansbury who was pretty good.  I also wish there was a soundtrack available of Patricia as Ruth - I had to make my own by recording her songs off the DVD.

1788855,4,B00006RCMW,"This is one of those happy events that the viewer has the opportunity to share in; everybody is having a great time doing a live performance of Pirates of Penzance at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park. The cast, led by Kevin Kline feeds off the audience reaction and gives a spirited performance that is delightful and filled with fun.

I found it a joy to join in on the festivities of this event from 1980 and can easily see why the decision was made to turn this into a movie in 1982. I've had the LaserDisc version (1983) of the movie for many years and have enjoyed the performance repeatedly during those same years. I see the DVD version of the movie is now being shipped and look forward to getting it as well.

I was surprised and pleased to discover this stage version with most of the movie cast intact except for Patricia Routledge who was replaced by Angela Lansbury in the movie version. Routledge was better known as Hyacinth Bucket in Keeping Up Appearances, or Hetty Wainthropp in Hetty Wainthropp Investigates. In these rolls she didn't reveal her talent as a singer so the considerable talent she displayed as Ruth came as a surprise.

It is not as if this recording doesn't have some problems; the sound and lighting leave a considerable amount to be desired. If one considers the venue, the date, and the rather predictable limitations encountered in a Central Park production the quality is not really surprising.

I for one found the excitement and enthusiasm generated by an appreciative audience and a spirited performance more than compensates for technical inadequacies. For the collector I believe this to be an indispensable addition to one's collection.

If, on the other hand, you will have only one copy of Pirates of Penzance then this may not be your best choice. I would probably suggest the new DVD version of the movie which is available now from Amazon.com. I believe I now have four different versions of this work and if I find another one of interest I'll probably add yet another version.

In summary, this is a fun and joyous performance before a live audience who enjoys the work and energizes the performers on stage. I found it a happy, fun experience!",1284681600,3,2202,4.706493506493507
1788856,4,B00006RCMW,"""Pirates of Penzance"" was the first of Joseph Papp's productions in Central Park, and the quality of the operetta's production shows through.  The actors range from tremendous (Kevin Kline as the Pirate King and Patricia Routledge as Ruth) to very competent (whatever happened to Rex Smith).

The comedic interaction with the orchestra is as Gilbert & Sullivan would have wanted.  What they really would have preferred, however, was better camera and sound quality.  The constraint is that this is a play performed outdoors, in the summer, in Central Park.  Given those constraints, the camera work was admirable and the sound quality quite acceptable.

I attended this production, as well as seeing it performed by (essentially) the same cast on Broadway a year later.  I have never understood (other than marquee value) why Routledge was replaced by Angela Lansbury on Broadway; you will see that Routledge was an inspired casting choice here.",1284076800,3,945,5.218543046357616

Linda Ronstadt, coming off several hits in the realm of rock, belts her soprano offerings surprisingly well as Mabel Stanley -- the youngest daughter of the major general. Rex Smith -- who plays Frederic, the duty-driven on-again, off-again pirate apprentice -- has an excellent tenor voice (including the high B-flat, sung full voice, in ""Oh, Is There Not One Maiden Breast"") and pulls off his portrayal like the stage pro he didn't become until later. George Rose brings the crowd to its feet with his rendition of ""I Am the Very Model of a Modern Major General"" and clearly relishes the role. Patricia Routledge is far better as Ruth, Frederic's nurse maid and ""piratical maid of all work,"" than either of the two actresses who succeeded her -- Estelle Parsons on Broadway and Angela Lansbury in the 1983 movie. Routledge plays Ruth with more abandon and sings the role with confidence and quality, allowing Smith and Kline to pull out all the stops in their roles. And Tony Azito, as the sergeant in charge of the band of constables that may have inspired the Keystone Kops, dances and sings with flair. Two songs were added to the original Gilbert and Sullivan production -- ""My Eyes Are Fully Open"" from ""Ruddigore,"" which allows Routledge, Smith and Kline (sounds like a law firm) to rollick and is a delight. And ""Sorry Her Lot"" was added from ""HMS Pinafore"" to allow Ronstadt a chance at the kind of ballad that she was known for before coming to the stage. The only negative I can think of is that the orchestra pit could have been a little lower, as musical director William Elliott's conducting almost distracts from the efforts of the wonderful cast in this staging of a show that veteran fans of G&S and newcomers should both cheer.",1271203200,3,2047,4.7366946778711485

Kevin Kline and the other principals who went on to make the later ""Pirates"" film are all in good voice here (although I cannot understand why George Rose introduced the irritating nasal whine in ""I am an orphan boy"" here, which he later repeated in the film  -  there must be some subtle cultural reference that I am missing).  Linda Ronstadt seems less secure in her singing than she was in the film, but perhaps that is just the result of a live performance as opposed to multiple takes.

However, I do remember the film version which was released with Angela Lansbury playing the part of the nurse.  Obviously there is more you can do with a filmed version than you can with a staged version.  Kevin Kline's antics in the film version of ""I Am a Pirate King"" allowed for much more than you can do on stage, and Tony Azevedo as the policeman with his Keystone Cops gang were highlighted with the camera angles and staging.

1788900,3,B00006RCMW,"Every summer, the New York Shakespeare Festival presents outstanding free productions in Central Park featuring big-name casts. This disc is derived from a problematic videotape of one such performance. The cast is fantastic, the orchestrations and staging are fun, and the audience in the Delacorte Theater obviously had a great time that night.

This production, which later transferred to Broadway, was taped for television. It apparently never aired. Presumably this was due to the tape's serious technical faults, including a miscalibrated camera that produced overexposed, washed-out images in Act One, and audio glitches in Act Two (caused by momentary tape-speed problems that become more frequent toward the end of the performance).

To make matters worse, the only known master tape is a grainy, badly worn work dub. It does not meet the professional broadcast standards of ANY era, much less our own. Some cleanup was done for the DVD release but the various cameras' shots were apparently not ""graded"" to give consistent brightness, contrast and color. Even if this had been done, no amount of digital restoration can fix the overexposed shots in Act One.

I'm so happy that a record of this performance exists, and I'm glad to have this DVD in my library (particularly since I saw this production twice on stage in the 1980s and enjoyed it immensely). But you should know what you're buying.",1207785600,2,1404,5.149122807017544

I particularly enjoyed Patricia Routledge's characterization of Ruth. I am a big fan of ""Keeping Up Appearances"" and enjoyed hearing her voice in it's real beauty. So, there are advantages to each version, and I believe I enjoyed them about equally.",1202515200,4,664,4.698275862068965
1788902,1,B00006RCMW,"It's entirely possible the performance recorded was excellent.  However, the video quality is horrible.  Apparently whoever filmed this could not manage to compensate for the bright lighting required for a live perfornace as the video is far too bright, looking badly washed out as a result.

My wife is hardly what you would call a video phile, but she could barely make it through the first 20 minutes of this DVD.  The video looks as if the DVD were made directly from the original video tape release with no attempts to enhance or improve the picture.  Honestly, I have seen better video quality from the small city little theater my niece worked for.

Another reviewer has claimed that one should be prepared for poor quality video based on the age of the recording.  I disagree.  Before selling a DVD as a professionaly produced product, you ought to actually have a product that looks as if it were professionaly produced.  If the company cannot be bothered to put some effort into improving the video quality, they should at least warn potential customers of that fact.  I'd suggest a banner across the front of the DVD reading ""WARNING: Sub par video quality, buy at your own risk!""  Of course, that would cost them sales, but failing to disclose the poor quality of the video strikes me as dishonest.

Bottom line: if the prospect of the poor video quality doesn't bother you, I'm sure you'll enjoy the presentation.  Otherwise, steer clear.",1202169600,2,1451,4.80241935483871
1788903,4,B00006RCMW,"This isn't the usual kind of video. It presents a live stage production, performed in front of a large and very enthusiastic audience. As a result, it captures the best of live theater, including the energy that the cast seemed to draw from the crowd. Between G&S's original intent and the remarkable staging, the entire crew threw themselves into athletic over-acting that enhanced the musical humor with physical humor - including some sparring with the orchestra pit. The musical humor was there too, not just in the original libretto, but in Ronstadt's amazing use of her vocal skills as Mabel. Routledge put in an outstanding performance as Ruth, and who knew that Kevin Klein could sing? Maybe he'll never headline at the Met, but he served the role of the pirate king more than adequately.

Anyone minded to complain will find plenty to complain about. The camera's focus sometimes takes a moment to find itself, and the first half is as bright and washed-out as the second half is dim. Production doesn't meet blockbuster standards, and post-production just doesn't exist. All those things apply to a video that this never tried to be. This documents a unique, live performance, in which recording took second place behind pleasing the audience in front of the stage. Taken for what it is and meant to be, it's huge fun.

1788905,4,B00006RCMW,"I saw this production, at the Delacorte, when it was done in 1980.  I was a young girl, and I fell in love with Kevin Kline that night, and have remained so over the years!!!  Helps that beyond being mega-talented, he's also a lovely human being.

Considering that this was done 27 years ago, it truly is amazing that we have this recording, and for all the quality issues, it is still a performance worth having and enjoying over again.  Kline had already won a Tony (for ""On the Twentieth Century"") but had not yet become a film star (which would happen with ""Sophie's Choice"").  George Rose, a fantastic actor, truly WAS the ""modern major general"".  Tony Azito is hysterical as the Chief of Police (remember him in ""Moonstruck""???)!!  Patricia Routledge, who was not held over to Broadway or the film, was a most delightful Ruth, much loved by the live audience.  Rex Smith was a charming, handsome and earnest Frederick, and Linda Ronstadt, although her singing was a bit disjointed (and the score was lowered a couple of steps!), made a lovely Mabel.

In this day and age we have become spoiled by technology.  Please remember that this is an historical record of a BRILLIANT show -- and as one reviewer mentioned earlier, hundreds were turned away nightly.  My friends and I were on line in the Park at 7 AM -- and it was SO worth the early morning hour and the long day on line.

I already own the Angela Lansbury movie version on VHS and wanted it on DVD, but since this was not available, I thought I'd get the Delacorte Theater version.

Okay, so the video and audio quality appalled me at first.  Then I got into the whole live performance experience and was able to appreciate the individual actors.  George Rose--stunning.  He was born to be on stage--a fact you really can't appreciate in the comparatively hokey film version.  Kevin Kline is just as maniacally funny in the film version as the stage version, but in the stage version you get caught up in the energy he creates with the audience response.  Patricia Routledge is excellent in the stage version, far superior in voice and acting to Angela Lansbury in the film version.  Rex Smith is astounding--what a crime his career didn't take off from this.  His voice and acting sent chills down my spine.  He's good in the film version, too, but to see him live is something you should not miss.  Linda Ronstadt is fine vocally in a very demanding role and takes chances I think no operatic singer would.  The quality of her voice is better in the film version--no surprise there--but consider her singing that role night after night, outdoors, with the wind blowing and the moths flying around, and you'll realize her performance on stage is close to miraculous.  Tony Azito is excellent in both versions, but again, the audience response to the bumbling policemen makes the stage version much more appealing.

How I wish a better recording of this show existed.  That being said, I'm grateful it exists at all.  I've seen Pirates many times--live performances by the University of Michigan Gilbert & Sullivan society and local theater groups, the Angela Lansbury film version, and the Stratford Festival live perfomance on DVD (buy this if you can get it).

78RPM recording because it's a notable artist performing his

work, you'd enjoy this DVD. If you worry more about background

noise, audio quality and limited dynamic range, this DVD is

probably not for you.

I bought this thinking it was the PBS version. It's not...it's

a videotape transfer of a live production three years earlier,

with most of the same cast. As others have noted, the video and

audio quality is not all that great in places. But the energy of

the performers makes up for it, IMHO, and it's a fine production

of the venerable G&S ""flagship"".

I particularly enjoyed Kevin Kline's performance. Look for his

long-held-note that ends with a fall off the stage, or his

devious sneaking-up-on-the-Major-General which is interrupted

by the abominable placement of an *orchestra pit* right where

he'd figured to be sneaking. Even a bit of counterweighting by

Frederick doesn't help.

Linda Ronstadt's voice is heavenly. I've always enjoyed her singing,

and she makes it clear in this show that she has a lot of breadth

to her future, as her subsequent work made clear.

1788930,4,B00006RCMW,"If you are willing to overlook the fact that the video is at times poor and the sound often uneven (otherwise, I'd have given it 4 stars), then you are in for a great treat.  The sheer energy and enthusiasm of both the cast and audience is unmatched, and the mis en scene is of a unique time forever gone, New York City at the end the 70's about to shift into the 80's.

Kline is terrific & Routledge is great: these two make the show (watch for Routledge's dramatics at the end of Act 1; Kline's brilliant in his ""Pirate King"" song, and his antics in Act II during the ""Paradox"" to ""Away, away"" scene are classic).  Rose IS the Major General.  Ronstadt is commendable (any pop singer who tries their hand at operattic singing has my respect - well, maybe not Michael Bolton...). Even Smith is bearable (a bit cheesy, but what are you gonna do - at least he doesn't seem to take himself all that seriously either).

Although some liked the movie version better, at least this production is in its entirety (the movie stupidly leaves out a the end of the Act 1 finale after ""Oh Happy Day"", and the second versus of ""A Policeman's Lot"" and ""Sighing Softly"").  It also resurrects the ""Major General"" reprieve lyrics at the end of Act II originally used by Gilbert for the New York premiere, which typically don't get included, but actually tie up the show perfectly.  And an added bonus is the use of the ""Matter Patter"" Song from Ruddigore with slightly changed lyrics (Kline does the last verse in one breath!).

1788954,5,B00006RCMW,"Before ""The Big Chill"" and ""A Fish Called Wanda"" made Kevin Kline a film star in the 1980s, he was still one of the greatest actors around. This recording of a 1980 production of Gilbert & Sullivan's ""Pirates of Penzance"" is an excellent example of his early work. As the 'Pirate King' Kevin Kline shines with every bit the brilliance and style he would later be known for.

The supporting cast was excellent as well. A young(er) Patricia Routledge was a joy to watch as 'Ruth' and George Rose was every bit the modern 'Major General'. Before watching this DVD I was not sure if I would like Linda Ronstadt, having remembered her pop music career, but I found her to be a very enjoyable 'Mabel' with an excellent voice for the role.

Some people have been disappointed at the technical quality of this recording. I disagree. Given how long ago this was recorded, the equipment used in those days, and the fact it was a live - outdoor - performance, I think the quality holds up quite well. I was never disappointed in what I was watching or listening to.",1142121600,8,1054,4.513089005235602

1788956,4,B00006RCMW,"From the first few bars of the Overture, a high-octane energy permeates through this legendary staging of THE PIRATES OF PENZANCE, the witty Gilbert & Sullivan operetta.  This is the acclaimed Joseph Papp/New York Shakespeare Festival production, videotaped live at the open-air Delacorte Theatre, just before the show transferred to Broadway's Uris Theatre for a run of over 700 performances.

Young Frederic is about to reach his 21st birthday and as such is allowed to leave his pirate apprenticeship if he so wishes.  He falls in love with Mabel, one of the many daughters of the eccentric Major-General, but his happiness is short-lived.  An eternal ""slave to duty"", Frederic finds himself back in the Pirate King's clutches due to a small technicality...

The original cast of this production is simply sublime, most of them went on to reprise their roles in a 1983 film version.  Kevin Kline's Pirate King is equal parts swashbuckling rogue and clueless klutz; Rex Smith is perfect as the innocent young Frederic; Patricia Routledge brings full comedic and musical life to Ruth, the ""piratical maid of all work""; and, in her theatre debut, Linda Ronstadt silenced her harshest critics by revealing a lilting yet merciless coloratura soprano voice as the beautiful Mabel.  Tony Azito's Police Sergeant is wonderful, as is George Rose playing the tongue-twisting Major General with catlike precision.  Delightful Alice Playten and Alix Korey lead the army of daughters.  Graciela Daniele's choreography captures a sense of whimsy and frolic, with some great acrobatic moves for the pirates and a cute Keystone Kops-Tinkertoy routine for the policemen.  This version of the show also includes interpolated pieces from ""Ruddigore"" and ""H.M.S. Pinafore"".

Linda Ronstadt's performance is especially good for a singer who was never trained in the classical roles.  The role of Mabel is one of the most demanding female roles in the entire G&S canon, and she pulls off the feat with incredible skill and flair.  Rex Smith perfectly partners her as Frederic and their duets are magical.

This was filmed on videotape in the early 80s, and the source is beginning to show it's age on this DVD release.  The image is fuzzy and overexposed at times, bleaching out colours and details, but the stage lighting does not help matters either, causing a `blooming' and ghosting effect on the performer's costumes.  The sound is easily heard but there are several instances of analogue wobble and tape-hiss.  These shortcomings aside, having this historic performance captured at all is a blessing.

Gilbert and Sullivan operettas are full of froth and fun, but this PIRATES is so delightful that it's positively featherweight.  An ideal way to spend a rainy weekend.",1141516800,24,2756,5.18058690744921

Even though the production had a ""no-star"" cast (Andy Gibb had been fired as Frederic), the show was a sheer joy to watch.  After wearing out the cast album, I eagerly awaited the movie.  I enjoyed the movie even though many of the songs were shortened.  Before I digress further, many years went by when I had noticed the DVD of the original Broadway cast.  I had heard that it was basically, a ""home-movie"" of the live show so I expected technical shortcomings.  In spite of grainy footage and fair to middling audio, the show once again brought tears of joy to my eyes.

This is NOT from the best sources. They didn't even try to find the best sources. For instance, this performance was recorded by a professional multi-channel recording truck, and they are credited at the end. They would have not gone to the trouble of doing so if they did not also record each camera's signal to 1"" or 2"" videotape.

So, where did this wretched thing come from? Probably a 3/4"" (Umatic) ""work tape"". These are typically used as a reference to mix the multichannel audio tapes down to stereo or surround. During that period, a warbling ""time code"" was recorded to a single channel of the multichannel master tape, and on a single channel of the video reference. One can hear the high-pitched sound of the ""time code"" leaking into the mono audio from the other track during the quiet bits.

The producers probably had access to the 2"" multi-track master audio tapes and the 1"" or 2"" video masters. But faced with the expense of doing it right - or just taking the money and running, they obviously decided they needed the exercize.

1788985,1,B00006RCMW,"No doubt a treat for the original 1980s audience, this DVD is a huge disappointment for those watching it on DVD. The video quality is incredibly poor, with artifacts all over the place, bright intrusive lighting which makes members of the orchestra appear to be major players, and a really small stage (I thought Broadway was the epitome of stage shows? This doesn't do them any favours). The entire thing (no, I exaggerate, since I couldn't bear to watch more than a couple of chapters) looks like a bad video of a school performance. These professional players perform better than a school company, of course, but it's really not that easy to tell on this recording.

I haven't mentioned the sound yet: it is also terrible. It's in mono, and is muffled to boot. Surely video producers in 1980 had heard of STEREO?

I can't wait to get my money back, from someone who loves this tripe (there seem to be many who can love this video despite its faults, going by this forum), and then I'll wait until I can get a copy of the 1983 film (which I thought I was buying) with many of the same cast, but shot as a movie, not a stage show.

I produced semi-professional videos of weddings, etc. for 10 years. If I had a tape as bad as this one, I'd have offered it to my customers at a big discount, if not for free - I'd be embarrassed to ask for money for it. I feel ripped off at having someone sell this on the regular retail market, at regular prices. The video itself warns you at the lower quality as you start to watch the disk, but the sales pitch on the website, and the outer case strangely never mention it. I almost made the mistake of importing it from overseas at much higher price - thank goodness I didn't.

Conclusion: Don't buy this unless you REALLY like videos of stage shows, and are not all that bothered about the quality of sound or vision of what you watch on your TV.

1788987,4,B00006RCMW,"For those who revel in polished audio and visual and the latest and greatest in those technologies, this DVD is probably just not for you.  On the other hand, if you love theater - raw, live, intimate - then this is as good as it gets. Personally, I love a live show and this performance definitely hits the spot.

In fairness, the DVD quality is not as rough as some would seem to suggest.  I was scared I wouldn't be able to make out any words or faces based on some of the reviews.  At the end of the day, it is an 80's quality video preserved on DVD.  Of course, the beauty of the DVD is that you can skip to your favorite parts (which I find very handy) and it will not wear through repeated playback like a video.

As to the performance itself, spectacular.  I personally feel some of it drags a bit - but that is just owing to my own particular taste.  I would rather laugh at the back story of Frederic's apprenticeship to pirates due to Ruth's hearing impairment, or revel with the joy it is to be a Pirate King, or most particularly dance about and laugh as the inept police do their thing than hear some of Ronstadt's/Mabel's ""arias"" (I was a little surprised that her voice and acting were not quite on par with my expectation).  Some sections drag a bit for me (others will find them the highlight, I am sure), but the highs are absolutely enjoyable!

And the individual performances must be applauded.  Kline hams it up beautifully as the Pirate King.  Smith conveys wonderfully his innocence and a sense of duty.  Routledge does wonderfully as his maid, Ruth.  And as others have highlighted, the Major General really brings out the best of his role and the audience.  All that being said, I'm a sucker for the policemen.  Their dancing about and general goofiness is wonderful.  Their ""leader"" does a phenomenal job and his performance (vocally and physically) is my favorite part of the show.

If you are looking for an audiovisual masterpiece, please pass.  You will be horrified.  If, however, you love theater and want to have a jolly good time watching others perform with all their hearts, you can't go wrong with this production.

Much hullabullo was made when this show arrived:  non-traditional singers/actors in a work almost historically bound by traditions.  The orchestrations were sacked in favor of synthesizers, marimbas and such and on its own merits the score is delightful.

Technically, the video quality is a bit on the rough side, but give yourself a couple of minutes and you won't notice it.  You'll be too busy getting caught up in the delightful high(and low!) jinx of the once-in-a-lifetime cast.

Ronstadt is ravishingly beautiful and in mostly terrific voice (a couple of incredibly high notes go a little wiry, but what the heck).  This was her stage debut and as long as she's singing (which is most of the time) she's affective and loaded with charm.  When speaking, alas, the pop diva ain't so convincing - but there's mercifully few of those moments.

Kevin Kline is a hoot and full of high camp as the Pirate King, impressively executing some tricky  choreography by Graziella Danielle.  George Rose IS the very model of a modern major general, Patricia Routledge is hilarious as Ruth and Rex Smith sounds terrific having a ball as Frederick.

Indeed the sense of live all-out-fun here is remarkable and more than a few musical moments pack some legitimate thrills.  The Act I finale with its improbable lyrics ""But they give up the felicity Of unbounded domesticity, Though a doctor of divinity  Is located in this vicinity"" gives

Ronstadt opportunity to let loose some legitimate soprano high notes and the sound is thrilling.

The audience is clearly relishing one whale of a good time and at times threaten to stop the show with cheers and applause.

There are many such moments and, well, heck, if you can't have a good time with this, I just give up!",1112054400,14,1963,4.855421686746988
1788989,1,B00006RCMW,"I had the pleasure of seeing this production on Broadway, and was looking forward to receiving this DVD.  It opens with an ominous warning that the 'digital re-mastering may reveal limitations of the source material'.  Boy, they weren't joking.  It looks like they got an old copy of the video tape, pulled it out of the cassette, dropped it into a bucket of Drano, and then transferred the result to DVD.  For my money, not even the performances (seen murkily) can overcome this major short-coming. A great disappointment.",1110153600,12,523,4.909090909090909
1788990,4,B00006RCMW,"The movie version of ""Pirates"" with Angela Lansbury was very disappointing. The DVD with Routledge as Ruth is wonderful. It was lovingly directed and filmed, and spontaneously and joyously performed. The film with Angela Lansbury went ""Hollywood"" by pandering shamelessly to the audience with silly staging. It is tiresome and forced. Angela Lansbury's interpretation is overdone and tedious.

The performances in the Central Park DVD version are all wonderful. Linda Ronstadt sings magically, Kevin Klein and Rex Smith are marvelous as are all the performers. General Stanley's daughers are a lot of fun to watch. Everyone's joy in performing was clearly appreciated by the audience. The scenery was simple but effective. The film version, on the other hand, featured elaborate studio sets that for me wound up detracting from the performances. The video quality of the Central Park performance was on a rare occasion sub par but that does not, in my opinion, interfere with the enjoyment. The costumes in the Central Park performance were much better too...I hated the night caps General Stanley's daughters wore in the Angela Lansbury film version. Ruth's change of costume in the Central Park version were very clever...as she finally donned a pirate outfit after Frederick rejected her. Routledge was wonderful in the role. She has a great voice too.",1103500800,11,1355,5.273148148148148

It was thrilling to recognize Patricia Routledge.  I fell in love with Frederic and adored Kevin Kline as the Pirate King.  It was remarkable how lively and animated the performance was.

1789004,2,B00006RCMW,"It is valuable to have a record of a notable Broadway production, but you should be aware that this record is barely adequate. The audio is a satisfactory record of the event and while the visuals enable one to appreciate the staging they do little to show the skill and energy that was a feature of the show.
The major faults are in two departments. The first is in the clumsy camerawork and TV direction that misframes action and misses bits of important ""business"". Here a minor complaint is the visible camerman peering out of a hole in the set which adds a distraction that his viewpoint of the back of the cast does nothing to justify. Secondly the visual quality is terrible. Only in close up are facial features resolved, everthing further away is a blur of TV defects. The extensive ghosting suggests a recording of poor quality TV reception, even though the credits suggest a direct videotape recording was made.
However if you can cope with a visual quality that is similar to home TV reception in a remote valley poorly placed in relation to the broadcast transmitter, then go for it! Be aware that this DVD is not a patch on the 1983 film version with the same cast.",1086739200,9,1179,4.566037735849057

 Nevertheless, nevertheless, it's fun to watch. It is a live

1789008,5,B00006RCMW,"I previously rated the VHS version of this Joe Papp production (which I fortunately have on Laserdisc). It's one of my favorites, but the VHS version was recorded later for cable broadcast and it suffers from it. Although it has excellent picture and sound (at least on my Laserdisc), it frustratingly falls short of the original cast CD. To fit its time slot, some verses or even whole numbers were omitted, while more visual business was added - some of it over-the-top silly.
This DVD is from a taping of a live performance in Central Park. It suffers from wind noise in the microphones, bugs flying around, and all sorts of other hazards of a live taping. Not that it's bad, but simply don't expect the same audio and video quality of the slick later soundstage production.
Having said all that, I wouldn't give up either of them! This version was made some 3 years years before the other and it shows on the actors who all are obviously younger. Better yet, it has all the verses and all the numbers that are on the CD - even the ones ""borrowed"" from other G&S works. The same sense of fun prevails. Patricia Routledge actually fits the part of Ruth better than Angela Lansbury did in the later production (both are *far* better than Estelle Parsons who's on the CD!) One minor disappointment is that the camera never pays enough attention to Tony Azito, who pretty much stole every scene he was in in the later production. Possibly just as well - wearing stage makeup and without the moustache he sported in the later version, he looks a little goofy here.
So take your choice... A great, but incomplete production on VHS or this technically inferior, yet intact production on DVD. I'm just glad to have both.
UPDATE:
Since this is a favorite in my family, I've now watched it several additional times with various family members. Imperfect as it may be, it's easily become my favorite of the two. The infectious sense of fun, the audience interaction, Routledge's superior performance - all set it apart. Will I still buy the soundstage production if it's released on DVD? Yes, if only for The better presentation of ""When the Foeman Bares His Steel"". But if I could have only one, I'm afraid this would be it.",1062547200,10,2217,4.629441624365482
1789009,5,B00006RCMW,"Thank goodness this version of Joseph Papp's ""Pirates"" has been unearthed and released to the public! For as lavish as the 1983 film version is, I always felt that it was lacking something....a live audience.
With the exception of Kevin Kline's performance, this live recording of the Central Park production is very charming and well worth the watch. Mr. Kline is wonderful as The Pirate King, but his performance in the 1983 version is far better. After 3 years of performing the role, he perfected it, and truly made it his own.
Reviews back in 1980 complained about Linda Ronstadt's performance as Mabel, noting her lack of acting training. I found her to be perfectly charming and quite adorable. She's a cross between Snow White and Lilian Gish...the perfect mix! She handles the vocal difficulty of the role with ease and clarity. Her upper voice is slightly improved by the time the big screen version was shot, but this early attempt is wonderful! And Mabel really doesn't have a lot of acting depth to her anyway....G & S wrote her as a parody of grand opera sopranos. Player her ""straight"", as Ronstadt does, and she's fabulous.
The late George Rose and the late Tony Azito are almost exact on both versions...which to me a sign of a great performer. I always heard the Rose did the entire movie version with no retakes, and I can now understand why...he's flawless. Azito could have given Ray Bolger a run for his money back in the day...the man was like rubber.! I would have loved to have seen him play the Scarecrow in The Wizard of Oz! Sadly both Rose and Azito were taken from us before their time. It's a great loss.
Patricia Routledge leaves Angela Lansbury in the dust in the battle for the better Ruth. Routledge actually had a character unlike Lansbury who simply played Jessica Fletcher as Ruth....serious miscasting there folks! If you are a fan of Patricia Routledge in ""Keeping Up Appearances"", this is a must see for you!
The video used for the DVD and VHS versions of this show is very rough. It's been digitally cleaned up a much as possible, but it is 23 years old! Only so much can be done! But it's worth the watch anyway!

1789010,5,B00006RCMW,"The complaints I've been reading here are:
1. Why didn't they tell me that this isn't the Angela Lansbury version?  (If you had looked for Lansbury's name in the description, you would have noticed its absence.)
2. The video quality is sub-par!  (Knowing in advance that this was recorded outdoors over twenty years ago, I was prepared for less-than-broadcast quality.)
3. It's LIVE... EEEEWWWwwwww!  (Get a grip.)
I like the 1983 movie version a lot.  But this version kicks the movie version's buttocks so thoroughly that I probably won't order it when it becomes available.
Patricia Routledge's performance is ten times better than Angela Lansbury's.  In the movie Lansbury, after several years of playing Mrs. Lovett in ""Sweeney Todd"", apparently was sick of Cockney dialects, and played Ruth as Irish.  It didn't work and she wasn't that funny.  Routledge is funny and has a gorgeous voice.
What is glorious about seeing the live performance is the energy that the cast gets from the audience reactions.  George Rose, after the Major General song, isn't applauded... he's CHEERED.  There is no way that this type of response can fail to pump up the cast.
This really is the type of material seen best with audience reaction, the same reason that films like ""Noises Off"" and ""A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum"" don't really work.  If you love theatricality, this is for you.",1055462400,199,1391,4.905982905982906

In addition Fredric has just discovered what young women look like and had fallen for Mabel, daughter of the Major general. All of this is about to change.

I have always enjoyed the variations of ""The Pirates of Penzance"". Among my favorite is this Broadway theater archive from 1980. It was recorded at the New York Shakespeare Festival. The cover of my copy of the DVD looks like the standard cover of the series which is also the one on the VHS. It is distributed by Kultur.

You need to know that this film has all the strengths and weaknesses of a stage production vs. the Movie. The sound sometimes comes and goes and you have to listen closely to understand much of the singing. It helps to know what you are watching in advance. On the positive side I have always appreciated the minimal scenery of the stage and marvel at how so many can do so much with so little. This is an excellent film for those living in a culturally deprived area and to hold others until they can see the real thing again.

Just so you know this is not a movie. So many of the players push the envelope with their variation on the Gilbert & Sullivan theme and music. Speaking of music the stage surrounds the orchestra so you can watch them and occasionally the audience. Linda Ronstadt as Mabel has a surprisingly high voice at first and I assume is on purpose soon she settles down and you would thing that the play was made just for her. Kevin Kline adds the over the top energy needed to keep this fast passed play going. When all is said and done you will be exhausted from listening and laughing.

7972603,5,B00006RCMW,"This is the original performance that the 1983 movie is based on--a theatre performance in Central park in 1979.  Fair warning--the sound quality isn't the best, making Gilbert and Sullivan's already-hard-to-follow dialogue even trickier.  And the cinematography is sometimes hit or miss.

BUT.  As good as the movie is, the performance is better. A lot of extra gags the movie added are cut, making for more streamlined humor. There are also some original songs the movie cut (""How Beautifully Blue the Sky"", ""When Love is Alive and Hope is Dead""), and others that the movie slims down (""When a Felon's Not Engaged in His Employment""). Kline and Ronsdtadt are as excellent as in the movie, but Rex Smith is a more believable babe-in-arms, and George Rose's performance is more spontaneous and not quite as overblown.  Patricia Routledge beats out Angela Lansbury's Ruth.

Yes, its a stage performance, but that's what makes it great.  This was meant to be performed.  Part of the problem with the movie is that the actors never seem to know quite which way to face--they always act like they're on a stage, even as the camera moves around them.  Here, that's part of the charm.  Kline fights with the conductor.  The orchestra pit gets in the way of a particular scene.  You can hear and see the audience screaming with laughter at lines.

So yes, the sound quality is bad, and it's not cut to be a movie.  But it's a stupendous adaptation, and you should watch it.",1465084800,3,1466,4.765873015873016
