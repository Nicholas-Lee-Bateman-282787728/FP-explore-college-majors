8214267,1,B000UPBUBS,"I thought this was a foreign movie that might have some interesting twists.  I was so fooled I tried to change the language in the menu to English only to find out it was already an English flick.  (Color me stupid).  In fact, it is a Cinemax movie that I have cut off after 15 minutes under a different title on late nite TV.  It is only worth purchasing if you cannot afford premium cable channels and you are very lonely.  R-rated sex, the same women you find in dozens of Cinemax movies doing the same guys.  An absolute waste.",1208908800,2,531,4.26
