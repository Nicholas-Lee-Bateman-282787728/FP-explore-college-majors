It was one of the best concerts I've experienced and I was moved to tears.  Favorite line of that night:  ""don't get too perky . . . ""  Sorry for all your legal/artistic battles Moz, but we've been waiting for this for a long time.  It can now be viewed on YouTube anyway.  THANK YOU TO EVERYONE who has posted it on YouTube!!",1329177600,4,467,4.411764705882353
8297626,1,B001ECE5VI,"Statement From Morrissey:

The slapdash release of Morrissey live at the Hollywood Bowl is done by Warner without any consultation to me whatsoever, and is in breach of their terms as laid out by themselves in an agreement made for the film between Warner and my ex-manager. Being Warner, predictably the sleeve art is appalling. It is the work of cash-hounds, and I urge people NOT to buy it. I am not signed to Warner, and no royalties from this dvd will come to me. Please spend your money elsewhere.
Thank you, MORRISSEY.",1327449600,23,525,4.645161290322581
8297627,5,B001ECE5VI,"But this is a FANTASTIC DVD. Great sound, great pic, filming, editing and performance. The band plays songs from all eras machine-gun style one after the other including several Smiths' ones in a 102' long show. Plus there's some extra aggro to the overall sound, esp on the guitars; versions are heavier and faster-paced. I loved them !!

Sorry Mozz we all know you were bummed by this release, but it is a must have for the fans. A friend bought me the russian release in Europe and mailed it to me.

Who Put The M In Manchester was a good DVD but this one got the ball out of the park
!!  No money in it for you ? Sorry mate, but don't deprive your fans from watching it; they're not to be blamed for your contractual troubles.

Much as I'm fond of the guy I had to take this statement off my chest.

GET IT YOU'LL DROOL ALL OVER IT !!!

It just R - O - C - K - S  !!!!!",1324684800,3,873,3.954285714285714
8297628,1,B001ECE5VI,"Aside from the highlights in the promotional video for ""That's How People Grow Up"", I'm not writing this to comment on the content, editing or other unknowns of a release that is definately on hold for the time being. For everyone waiting whether they were at this sold out performance or not, as fans we must remember that it was his night as well. It would also be wise to set aside what his financial worth is without this DVD. As Morrissey has stated in writing there was no consultation even down to the cover art on a product that bears his name. Like many other loyal fans I want this to become available as soon as possible. However, above all else our loyalty must be for the artist without whom this recording would NEVER be availible. Why? Because we must.",1240963200,6,767,4.446808510638298
8297629,1,B001ECE5VI,"Dear Friends,

Morrissey requests that we do not purchase this DVD due to contractual issues. Please look for Morrissey live in Manchester.",1229558400,7,139,5.318181818181818
