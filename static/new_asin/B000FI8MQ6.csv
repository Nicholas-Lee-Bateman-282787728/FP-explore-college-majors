2566113,4,B000FI8MQ6,"Its a B movie, but its a well made B movie that entertains, though not quite as much as the first Road House.  I expected no relation to the first Road House with this sequal, but there is.  Jonathan Schaech plays a DEA agent, who is the son of Patrick Swayze's character from the first Road House.  He takes over running the bar for his Uncle (Will Patton) who is in the hospital after getting the beat down from the movie bad guy, played by Jake Busey.  The same ""3 bar rules"" are applied from the first movie.  And as things progress, more and more becomes too much in common with the first Road House.  I found that ok though, since most of the charcaters and action provided good entertainment for an hour and half.
One thing is for sure, the presence of Swayze is not felt at all in this film from Schaech, who semmed a bit bland.  In fact, the whole movie is toned down from the first.  But thats not to say there still isn't a good deal of action.  Jake Busey, typical B movie actor, actually does a decent job of coming off as a decent villain, though he can seem like an over aged brat at times.  One of the best treats is actor Richard Norton, playing the head boss.  He is obviously showing signs of aging these days, but manages to still get in a good fight scene and pull of the villain role swiftly.
As for action, don't expect any crazy bar fights like the first Road House, but there are more one on one fights that are quite fun to watch.  Schaech gets in a good fight with both Richard Norton and Jake Busey, both about the best scenes in the movie.
If you enjoyed Road House, this sequal is worth checking out.  The similarities may be dissapointing, but you get more solid action to add to the fuel.",1182211200,,1720,4.223241590214068
2566114,1,B000FI8MQ6,"Roadhouse two is a cute premise, trying to milk the idea of the original movie.

 DEA agent Sahne Tanner (Jonathan Schaech) is the son of Dalton from the original film. Many times during this film, his character is told sorry about his father's death. that is the only real connection from this film to the other.

Will Patton's acting is under used  as Tanner's Uncle  Nate who owns a Louiisana roadhouse  on the river, the Black Pelican. Tanner comes to help his Uncle Nate. Jake (Gary's son) Busey plays Wild Bill, the local drug dealer/gangster who wants the Pelican for his own base of operation and will do anything to get it.

The film is filled with action and low on plot. Not really what i call entertainment

SPOILER ALERT (DONT READ UNLESS YOU WANT TO KNOW!)-Busey Character tell Tanner that he killed Dalton, The epic finally battles ensues with the ending we all can see what happened through out the whole movie

Lets say this, I hope there isn't a ROADHOUSE THREE

2566116,3,B000FI8MQ6,"Roadhouse has become an inarguable cult classic. It was well made, had some decent actors in it, had some good fight sequences, hot women, and was tongue in cheek funny (whether the latter was intended or not.) Roadhouse 2 is a by-the-numbers sequel in almost every sense. It is basically the same as its namesake only not as good. It was a shame that the film-makers were unable to get Patrick ""Dalton"" Swayze to commit to making the sequel to reprise his role, if nothing else as a mentor to the next generation of world-famous bouncers. In this era of direct to video sequels of older movies in the attempt to create new ""franchises"" you could do worse than Roadhouse 2.",1158278400,3,673,4.570247933884297
2566117,3,B000FI8MQ6,"This sequel was certainly better than I thought it would be.  Will Patton, who plays the brother of Dalton (Pat Swalze) from the original film keeps the sequel together with his excellent acting.  The film, however, is just too similiar to the 1st and it kind of loses your interest halfway thru--its so perdictable. The fight scenes are pretty good but any film with Jake Busey in it is just an average B movie---the guy can't act for sure.  This film is worth a look--rent it-don't buy it--stick to the original one with better actors.",1153699200,5,537,4.631578947368421
2566118,5,B000FI8MQ6,"I loved the original Roadhouse and did not think a sequel could keep my interest, but was I wrong!  Johnathon Schaech really does Patrick Swayze justice!  He was very believable as Dalton's son and was awesome in the fight scenes!  This sequel was very entertaining and great fight scenes.  Johnathon is sexy and has my vote!

2566119,5,B000FI8MQ6,"Fans of the original ""Road House"" may argue the merits of any sequel, but RH 2 is a worthy successor to the Eighties cult favorite. This Son of Swayze chapter moves briskly from New York to Louisiana where Dalton offspring Johnathon Schaech must defend the Black Pelican bar, now his uncle's bayou domain, against takeover by a southern crime syndicate.  The ensuing battle sets the stage for a rowdy mix of fist fights and redneck sideshows in keeping with the first RH.  There's much to cheer in this welcomed summer release including beautiful locations and heroic charisma from the lead.  Two superb actors, Richard Norton as the criminal kingpin and Will Patton as the good uncle, distinguish the project in their supporting roles.  Given the talents of these actors, they are not allowed enough screen time.  Norton's well tailored Victor Cross is the type of villain that audiences relish.  Norton plays him perfectly, as a methodically menacing overlord from Miami.  When Norton, a famed martial artist, and Schaech are unleashed against each other, the movie finally delivers an edgy fight scene.  More room in this ""House"" should have been reserved for Norton. If the series has another entry, it will be a smart move to encore Norton

and his character as the franchise's bad guy.  Victor Cross is a suitable crocodile to keep those Dalton boys busy!",1153353600,9,1361,4.955947136563877
2566120,4,B000FI8MQ6,"This movie was filmed mostly in my hometown and so, I just had to buy it.. And I really wasn't expecting a lot, especially since this is a straight to DVD flick. But the movie was done very well. The acting was well done on most accounts, however, some of the cliche's or lines they used from the original Road House was a bit humorous...

The fight scenes were well done, though, could've been edited a little more in my opinion. The lead character in this did a very good job playing the role. Jake Busey was very good as well",1153267200,3,528,4.227722772277228

This was a good decent solid action flick with plenty of good music, good fights, good eye candy and above average acting from all concerned. Some nods to the original in this film, largely relating to Daltons son, played well by Johnathon Schaech. Jake Busey carrying the bad guy torch was also fun to watch.",1153094400,7,455,4.7

2566153,3,B000FI8MQ6,"Wow!  A sequel to Patrick Swayze's legendary ""Road House""!  I didn't know this existed until it fell into my lap.  Expecting nothing I was pleasantly surprised while also realizing that ANY expectations would've been met with a direct-to-video jab to the ribs.  So if you go into this thinking it's good or a decent continuation of the story you will be disappointed.  Let's face it, the original ""Road House"", as fun as it is, is a cheesy, slightly unconventional B-movie that was released theatrically and actually did well.  This sequel replaces some of the original's fist-fights with more conventional shoot-outs and explosions, while still having a reasonable amount of fist-fights.  I prefer the elder's method.  This is also even dumber and not nearly as cohesive.

Shane Tanner (Jonathon Schaech, ""The Doom Generation"") is a D.E.A. agent, working in New York, when he receives a phone call from a Louisiana deputy saying that his Uncle Nate (Will Patton,  ""Remember the Titans"") is in intensive-care after he was found with the crap kicked out of him.  Upon arrival, the sheriff's department seeems content to call it random, which Tanner ain't buyin'.  His uncle is the owner of The Black Pelican, a bar located in the bayou that local drug dealer Wild Bill (Jake Busey, ""Starship Troopers"") has been making lucrative offers on for quite some time.  Seems Nate wouldn't sell and the club's location is geographically convenient for large-scale narcotics transactions.  Shane decides not to close or sell the bar and will have to contend with Bill's goons causing more trouble. Oh, and yes, this is a direct sequel and Shane is supposed to be Dalton's son, though the name discrepancy is never explained.

I'll get straight to the fights.  Not bad but I'd place them in the same category as the film itself: don't expect anything and you may be pleasantly surprised.  Fans like me may have a hard time doing that knowing that the stunt coorordinator is J.J. Perry, who that same year, choreographed the awesomeness that is ""Undisputed 2"".  While these brawls are decent, they're nowhere near as exciting as ""U2"".  That being said, Wild Bill's thug, Marcus, is played by Larnell Stovall, who choreographed the awesomeness that is ""Undisputed 3"" and gets his tail kicked about as many times as one dude can in one film!  The presence of veteran fighter Richard Norton, as Bill's superior, should not get one's hopes up, as he only has one fight and lays off the kicks of his earlier years.  The bonus brawl comes from the inevitable girl-on-girl fight.  Beau (Ellen Hollman, ""Skateland"") as the love-interest against Bill's knife-wielding girlfriend, Nadja (Marisa Quinn, ""The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn-Part 2""), engage in a pretty good fight and, while far from perfect, is one of the better and more consistent scuffles the film has to offer.  What I found particularly odd is that our hero has very few fights.  Jonathon Schaech shows a bit of fu-prowess while working-out but it's hard to tell if he's doing his own moves or is being doubled.

The most interesting thing about this film is how the producers attempt to have characters & scenes imitate characters & scenes from the original.  This archetypal mimicry comes off more as caricature than memento so it's pretty funny.  For instance, the first film had blind guitarist Jeff Healey as the leader of the house band.  This one has blues rocker James Otto, who appears to have no disability, so standing next to him on stage is a dwarf with crutches!  We get no covers of classic bar tunes from The Doors or Cream, either.  Jake Busey seems a bit restrained in his ""Brad Wesley"" moments and that's too bad.  This is the kind of role Busey could sink his infamous teeth into, like he did in ""The Frighteners"".  His fights aren't very good either.

The Sony DVD has good widescreen picture-quality with no special features.  In English with French or English subtitles.  In the realm of standard DVD-ception, the foxy twins on the cover are actually only in the movie for about two seconds, within the first few minutes.  This is fairly fun but not nearly as much as the original and if your curiosity is still aroused it may be right for you.  Otherwise it should probably be avoided.  Yet I can't help but think I wouldn't mind another one of these.

The characters bleed red, the romance is awkward yet works and the action almost is a blur. Fortunately there's no overplaying the DEA factor in this movie and they stay mostly in the background. You also don't get the typical suicidal loner driven by a need to beat the drug beast, there's no grand conspiracy theories here but revelations built upon revelations. Finally we have a woman who kicks ass as good as the men in this endeavor but this is still a B grade movie and should be viewed as such. That being said everything else works, the protege has every trace of the same steady nature his father has along with the violence(although oddly enough there's an open ended question of the who the mother is), his uncle and g/f have the same spunk of the previous film yet thankfully less of the pacifistic qualms when it comes to getting down and dirty.",1305158400,,1008,4.543956043956044
