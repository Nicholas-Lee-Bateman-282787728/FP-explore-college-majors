3724929,5,B001NYRCIA,"Great show; really an engaging story line; Not just for baseball fans - the kids, my wife and I all loved it.  Only complaint is that it ended so soon - I'm sure a lot of great footage ended up on the cutting room floor.  I'm looking forward to seeing more of John's films in the future.",1231804800,,287,4.017543859649122
3724930,5,B001NYRCIA,"I watched the whole thing and it was wonderful.  great job and great look inside the world of minor league baseball.

Get this DVD to help you beat cabin fever while you wait for the snow to melt and you are able to get back out to a ballfield!

Highly enjoyable DVD!",1231718400,,267,4.096153846153846
3724931,5,B001NYRCIA,"This is a great presentation of the South Georgia Peanuts.  I had the privilege of umpiring in Albany for the Inaugural Season of the South Coast League.  This DVD set is a nice summary of the season and its ups and downs.

My wife and her friends who attended several games love the DVDs.  The pranks and umpire discussions are their favorite parts.

Thanks again for doing such a great job with the DVD set!!!",1231632000,,411,4.426666666666667
3724932,5,B001NYRCIA,"This is a must-see video for any fan of baseball. John Fitzgerald has hit this one out of the park! The bar has been raised from his previous masterpiece ""Emerald Diamond.""  Add this to your video library and you can't go wrong. Keep it on the shelf by your copy of ""Bull Durham"" or ""Major League.""",1231632000,,298,4.321428571428571
3724933,4,B001NYRCIA,This reality documentary follows a baseball team in the independent South Coast League. It shows the struggles of the players and coaches with an inept league management and poor working and living conditions. Former Met second Baseman Wally Backman is the manager and really makes the film interesting. Some players instruct the viewer how to pull baseball pranks. The only drawbacks to the DVD is that they didn't remove the bleeps from the TV version and there are lots of television teasers that could also have been removed for the sake of DVD format.,1231632000,,556,4.925531914893617
3724934,5,B001NYRCIA,"I found this great reality show thru seeing another great film this guy made, ""The Emerald Diamond"" a film about the creation of the Ireland's national Baseball team.
  Playing for peanuts is a very unique look into the lives and minds of the young men who have a dream of playing in the ""Show"" someday. You watch a show like this and you truly get a great feel for what it really does take to get all the way to the ""Big Leagues"". The director was either very smart or very lucky, to have ex- New York Mets star Wally Backman as the manager of the ""South Georgia Peanuts"". His insight into baseball and how he deals with his ""Kids"" is the most interesting facet of this series. There are obviously a ton of great situations that come up for these players that create plenty of very funny moments, but in the end it is still all about Baseball, and if you truly are a passionate baseball fan; the kind of baseball fan that would actively seek out a Documentary about the making of the Irish national Baseball team,(Like me!!!) then you will adore this series of daily life in the minor leagues watching these kids play on there field of dreams.",1231545600,,1144,4.3915094339622645
3724935,5,B001NYRCIA,"This series was originally shown on a local cable station, and I eagerly awaited every episode. Then poof! it was gone ... so glad it's available on DVD.

Though there is a lot of focus on Wally Backman, the story is just as much about the young players chasing their dreams of making the big leagues. The cameras follow the ""Peanuts"" both on and off the field, showing what it's like to play minor league / independent baseball -- from the perspective of the participants. After watching a few episodes, I found myself rooting for the ballplayers as if they were my friends ... and also wondering how in the world Backman isn't a Major League manager.

You might have heard about how ""crazy"" Wally Backman is -- don't believe it for a second. There's little difference between Backman's passion and that of Lou Piniella, Tony LaRussa, or Bobby Cox, for example. IMHO, baseball can use more of these colorful ""throwback"" characters. But don't take it from me, watch these DVDs and decide for yourself.

If you are a young baseball player hoping to one day ""make the bigs"", or a former amateur ballplayer wondering what you missed, this documentary will give you a pretty accurate portrayal of life in the minors. I found it interesting to see how players develop friendships, interact with coaches, and spend their free time -- while remaining motivated to attempt to overcome the nearly impossible odds of making it to the Majors.

This is the ""Ball Four"" of baseball video, and a must-have for every baseball fan.",1231545600,,1515,4.749049429657795
3724936,4,B001NYRCIA,"Playing for Peanuts is a fun look into the life of minor league baseball.  It's not such a glamorous life before the bigs, and this gives an idea of the day to day grind.  It's fun to see the personalities of the guys off the field as well.",1231545600,,240,3.9791666666666665
8328400,2,B001NYRCIA,what about a play all button like 99.9% of videos so I do not have to stand up 10 times to change,1467072000,,97,3.4545454545454546
8328401,5,B001NYRCIA,This tells the true story! I love it. These young men deserve a lot of recognition for what they did. And how bout that Wally Backman...a true gem.,1397606400,,147,4.285714285714286
8328402,2,B001NYRCIA,"Did you see the WILDLY popular Wally Backman youtube videos?  Then decide I want to BUY the DVD to see more of this amazing and unabashed character.

If that is the case DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE.
Don't make the same mistake I did.

There is an uncensored version that you want.  Not this one.

I find it EXTREMELY confusing that they'd sell an uncensored version.  Lets be honest, WHO IS BUYING THIS FORTHE CINEMATOGRAPHY, and inspirational story????  People are buying Playing For Peanuts because they managed to capture some of the most real and captivating video of a manager and this DVD CENSORS IT!!!!!!!!

I give it 2 bleeping stars.",1335744000,2,636,4.666666666666667
8328403,5,B001NYRCIA,Wally Backman is a living legend! This show really captures how great of a manager he is.  I am halfway through the series and I absolutely love it!  Definitely a must have for baseball fans!,1305676800,,191,4.428571428571429
8328404,5,B001NYRCIA,I can't recommend this box set enough. Even if you are not a Mets or Wally Backman fan it is for all Baseball fans. The show is great in developing the characters that make up the South Georgia Peanuts. It's a must buy.,1288656000,,219,4.116279069767442
8328405,5,B001NYRCIA,"A highly entertaining look at an independent team in a now defunct league. The trails and tribulations are fun to watch. The politics of baseball at this level is exposed, along with the shortcomings of all involved. A real candid look at baseball on the fringes. Following the adventures of Wally Backman and the team is a real treat. If you want an unvarnished look at guys trying to stay in the game and more up the ladder, this is plenty good fun. The ""Prank School"" section is a kick.",1268438400,,489,4.444444444444445
8328406,5,B001NYRCIA,"Fun to watch and interesting,see some pro's early in their careers and what they go thru....BACKMAN is a piece of work...Well made and will get you thru your winter baseball blues",1263600000,,179,4.806451612903226
8328407,5,B001NYRCIA,This show really opened my eyes to what minor league players have to go through to make it big. Wally Backman is totally my hero (: Not to mention there's some total hotties on the team. The episodes were put together really good and the editing was great.,1232582400,,256,4.354166666666667
8328408,5,B001NYRCIA,"This is real baseball as close as your memories of the game as you played it and maybe even watched it, before major league baseball became a celebrity business . A hot-stove league of pleasure and a summer of baseball, just baseball....oh!  and Wally :)",1232582400,,254,4.644444444444445
8328409,5,B001NYRCIA,"""Playing for Peanuts"" is a thoroughly enjoyable look at baseball in the minors.  On the surface, it has the structure of a reality show series.  But unlike most reality shows, every story feels real, genuine.  Director John Fitzgerald is particularly strong at drawing out details--from the never-ending supply of bugs that plague the team as they prepare for a game or an interview, to the impact of less-than-stellar facilities and league management on the players' gameplay.

Fitzgerald wisely chooses a couple of threads to tie together the entire series.  On the one hand, we get a strong focus on manager Wally Backman, a character with a great heart but sometimes a short fuse.  He's certainly entertaining to watch, but he's also a phenomenal coach.  It's fascinating watching his incredibly strong commitment to the players' and league's development.  But Fitzgerald also tells the tale of the struggles of establishing and maintaining a minor league baseball league in the South.  Throughout the series he snags some excellent interviews not only with players, but also sports reporters, managers, owners, and local fans.  This DVD provides a rare look at a sport in search of a way to establish itself in a variety of communities, with a fair catalogue of most of its successes and failures.

My only criticism is that the end of the series--the last episode in particular--almost tried to do too much.  It seemed a bit rushed in places.  But viewers should keep in mind that Fitzgerald takes the project on as an independent director, doing most of the editing and production on his own.  All things considered, it's an impressively put-together documentary, perhaps not as ""professional"" looking as the high school football documentary ""Go Tigers"" but far more comprehensive in its portrayal of all aspects of the minor league experience of baseball.  Plus (and this should not be understated), the series has excellent humor throughout, showing the quirks of the various ballparks as well as the players goofing around with one another pre- and post-game.  A bonus of the DVD is a feature called ""Prank school,"" where the players give tips on the types of pranks played on each other and the coaches during the season.

All in all, this DVD is highly recommended for those who love baseball or who love good story-telling.",1232150400,5,2336,5.041666666666667
