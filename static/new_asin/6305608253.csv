It definitely touches the heart and mind subtly and abruptly with prime examples of where the heart of humanity has gone  and how man is no longer growing, but has chosen a declining path in the  future.  I always believed that the best lesson learned is not one told,  but taught.  This movie definitely has a lot to teach.",943142400,9,424,4.662162162162162

1049026,4,6305608253,"I had no doubt about the director Jon Turteltaub  since he made pretty good films. He is streight hollywood filmmaker and average boxoffice hit maker.
This movie was not an exception. There are a lot of cheesy moments to make the audience likable and that is only for the average audiences only.
But there are a lot of good impact moments too.
Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr had a very good chamistry from time to time and they worked very well. I mean truely beautifully.
Also the moments of flashback when Anthony faced with monkeys(I am not sure about this, maybe kingkong) and amazed how they accept him as their family. That part was amazing too. He pictured that scene very well. It was almost heartwarming and teardropping scene.
This movie was not a masterpiece but a very good one to watch.

In spite of the fact Hopkins looks to be in his 60s, his character is able to fly through the air  and kick the assets out of every security guard in an airport while handcuffed. The only sympathetic Black character in the movie is Cuba Gooding, - the rest are portrayed as savage, greedy gorilla killers (who deserve to die for killing a gorilla) or crazed bullies.

1049462,5,6305608253,"A touching movie. My heart ached for the useless destruction of God's creatures and ever for the eccentric man's pain in losing animals that he had grown to love. Later, was as always saddened by the helplessness of the mentally incompetent. What I heard the movie say was: See how much it hurts when we are unkind to those not as safe, not as independent, not as intelligent as we are. Aside from these feelings, I  was not okay with one man killing others, but I think the movie made it clear that there was confusion on the part of the officers, followed by reaction from a man torn and saddened by the unexpected attack.

I once watched two men tie a young steer to a tree and every time the steer came around the tree one of the men would strike him in the front of his head with the blunt end of a single blade axe. Over and over the young steer cried out in confusion and pain; over and over one of the men struck him with the axe. The icing on this twisted cake: The two men were laughing. This went one for a long time before the poor creature gave it up and fell to the ground. Then they chopped off his head with the blade and brought in the brains. One of the wives made scrambled eggs and brain for breakfast. I was sixteen and was stuck in this most horrible story. The man with the axe was my biological father whom I had come to visit on my way back to Oregon from K>C., MO. I was not acquainted with that unfortunate steer, but that did something to me. Cruelty in any form must be despised or we have forgotten that having the intelligence and power to have dominion is a responsibility not a license to be cruel. Mindlessly killing wild animals in their own habitat is stupid. Even to see it in a movie is startling.

In this movie, I noticed a comparison of animal cruelty and man's inhumanity to man. The look on  the face of the fallen leader, male, gorilla and that of the little inmate beaten by a guard, as he lay on the floor should remind us that people with minds that do not serve them well and thoughts that betray them still have feeling; they may experience joy and pain much like us. Animals that lose their family members, animals that are beaten, shot or otherwise molested can be hurt, confused, frightened, much as we. Robbers, even if no pain is inflicted, cause damage to their victims. I do not believe that animals are the same as we are, and because I believe this way, I feel an obligation to any living creature with which I come in contact. Physically, we are part of nature. When nature hurts because of our wrong doings, nature has no way to forgive us, even if the dog does. I talk about this movie because I think it is a very good movie. Not many movies will follow one home as did this one. Now, years later, I purchased, and watched this again. It is one of the best. No movie is flawless, so go for it. Shame on them for the bland cover and poor marketing. Let us be the judge of what we like!",1405209600,,2946,4.208849557522124

1049464,5,6305608253,"I really enjoyed this movie.  There is another one I am looking  for, it's done in the Amazon.  He does such a wonderful job.",1402704000,,125,4.125
1049465,5,6305608253,"What is the main purpose of a movie? To entertain and amuse in one way or another, right? In other words, captivate your attention for the span of the movie's runtime. Great movies do this and something else - they inspire you and make you think; maybe even enlighten. That's the power of the art of film. My wife and I just watched 1999's ""Instinct"" and it does this, which explains my high rating.

THE PLOT: Anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) goes missing in Africa for a couple of years; when he is found living with gorillas he kills a couple of rangers and injures others. After a year in prison in Africa, where he refuses to speak, he is extradited to a Florida prison and put in the mental ward. A young psychiatrist, Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding Jr.), is assigned his case to see if he can get him to speak and learn what really happened in Africa. Meanwhile Powell's daughter (Maura Tierney) anticipates reconciling with her father, IF Theo can get through to him.

There are some peripheral characters, but that's the gist of the story. Some people criticize it as a mix of ""Gorillas in the Mist"" and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" which is only valid on a surface level. I've seen the latter film (a great film) and ""Instinct"" stands on its own; in fact, it's quite unique, which is a sign of greatness. The movie stands or falls on Hopkins and Cuba Jr making the characters and their story come alive and seem real to the viewer. They succeeded for my wife and me. Within 20 minutes we found ourselves absorbed into the story and the characters.

Some people, like Roger Ebert, criticized that the film takes on too many topics or messages, but I never got this impression, nor did my wife. There are the main themes--the limitations of freedom in conventional society and the abuse of controllers (or ""takers"")--and there are a few subthemes, like the flaws of our prisons and mental institutions. The film never confused us or gave the impression that it cut off more than it could chew. If you appreciate films like ""Grand Canyon"" and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" you'll probably value ""instinct.""

Some criticized one aspect of the climax, but it happens. There are documented examples in the USA and all over the world. Also, keep in mind that Powell was imprisoned in the mental ward of the prison, not the maximum security area.

Is the story contrived to some degree? Of course it is; all movies are. Filmmakers have to tell a story and make their points within a limited time frame -- usually around two hours -- and so there are always contrived elements, coincidences, etc. The trick is to pull it off without seeming too phony or forced, which is sometimes hard to do and it takes good actors. Thankfully, ""Instinct"" does a respectable job on this front, perhaps mainly because it has a few great actors, although some viewers may roll their eyes at how the ""ace of diamonds"" subplot is wrapped up. Regardless, it's in the area of ideas that ""Instinct"" towers above most movies.

BOTTOM LINE: ""Instinct"" is a psychological drama/thriller that entertains but also makes you think and ponder: How free are we really in society? Are you a giver or a taker? A blesser or an abuser? A liberator or a controller? How can you be freer? How can you escape the manipulations and shackles of others, of society, of ""government""? How can you walk free of ""the game""? And so much more, like the ""doctor"" learning from the patient and the humility it takes to learn from someone who's ""under"" you.

The film runs 126 minutes and was shot in central Florida, Uganda and Jamaica.

1049801,5,6305608253,"Dr. Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) spent two years living with a band of gorillas in Africa. Nobody knew where he was until a group of hunters and game wardens came upon him in the jungle and he killed two of them and injured several more. He was tried by the Rwanda courts and sentenced, but the U.S. State Department got him back to the US. In the airport, he assaulted a group of security guards, and I think he killed a couple of them.

He has not spoken since the day he was arrested back in Rwanda, never participated in his defense, and is now in need of a psychiatric evaluation before the US decides what to do with him. He's in a maximum security prison, in the psychotic section.

Dr. Ben Hillard (Donald Southerland) assigns his best assistant, Dr. Theo Calder (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), to do the evaluation. Amazingly, Calder gets Powell to talk. He's very violent, but he's also so fascinating that Dr. Calder expects to write a book about him. In fact, Dr. Hillard assumes that's the main reason he wanted to do the evaluation.

So Calder goes to this snake pit of a prison every day and meets with Powell. He's also been conned into being on the staff of the psychiatric ward, and has to evaluate the other patients as well. You may see some scenes that put you in mind of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,"" but it's far more gritty. It becomes clear that the warden and his favorite guard are both sadistic bastards who use any excuse to brutalize the prisoners/patients. Since they put Dr. Calder on the staff, he feels obliged to fight back.

Another significant element to the story is Lynn Powell, Dr. Powell's daughter. Her side of it is much too complex to try to summarize here, but since you just have to see this film, you'll figure her out eventually.

It's a powerful statement about prisons, mental hospitals, man's relationship to the natural world, and a few other significant things.

BTW, Cuba Gooding, Jr., looked so familiar that I looked him up on Wikipedia. Turns out he played an angel-like character in ""What Dreams May Come"" with Robin Williams. The man is definitely eye candy, but he's also a very good actor. I predict big things for him. [Wrote this in January 2010. Turns out I was right.]",1336780800,,2229,4.546134663341646

Dr. Powell, who has been with a group of gorillas during all that time, is not talking at all and seems to be living in a dreamworld. Very slowly, Dr. Calder manages to reach Ethan Powell and starts finding out why Ethan killed two of the poachers. Yet Theo's case is not just about why the murders have happened, but also about how Dr. Powell became the being he is in the first place. With Ethan's silence broken, Theo is introduced into a world beyond common human comprehension: The true nature of being. He learns that mankind's control of everything is a mere illusion and that the true values of existence can't be found so easily. Ethan changes Theo's view of things forever. The strengths in this movie are numerous but it starts with the performances. Hopkins is quietly brilliant as the emotionally traumatized and scarred former anthropologist. You can feel his pain even before he tells what it is that is eating away inside of him. Cuba Gooding is great as the doctor that goes on a journey with Ethan Powell. I really enjoyed this movie.

1049807,3,6305608253,"This account of a wild and wooly Anthony Hopkins as a killer par excellence who was rescued from his prison in a jungle somewhere and then confined illegally in the U. S.  He had long white hair, strength of an ape (mountain gorillas), and look like Hemingway in 1954.  Like the animals he studied so dilligently, he had the instinct to fight for his survival.  Dr. Calvin writes about the marvelous ability of humans to think and choose to make decisions, solve problems, forecast the future and even create ethics, all using this mental Darwinism.

In the confinement in America, he refused to speak or socialize with the other prisoners, all of whom had mental problems.  The jail was full of psychotics and other mental criminals, caged like an animal and abused by the guards.  The cruelty in the guards' behavior caused a riot.  Ethan kept remembering base camp and what happened there, and reflected on his success and failure to protect the apes.  When he decided to trust the doctor, he asked him ""Are you free?""  He apparently he trusted him because he looked like the apes in the jungle.  He needed someone to listen about the murders.  ""I used to be you; see what I have become.""

What have you lost when someone else takes over control?  It takes a lot of confidence.  Now he has an opportunity to better himself by appearing in court.  Was it a Good Conviction like Lewis Weinstein's account in the book of the same name?  He had to hold on to show where the violence came from, killing the apes. and acted like a mad man.  Violence can be provoked.  Funny how things can change overnight.  Loving, petting, kissing, holding hands -- you put trust in a person who was not in control.  All was lost, taken away by force.  ""You taught me how to live.""

Ethan regressed after the guard's attack.  It is hard to see a grown man cry.  Failure makes anyone cry, even a woman.  He thanked the young doc for sharing this journey with him, your friend; then he returned to the wild.  This book tells how chimpanzies can't talk and why we forget our dreams.",1218326400,,2061,4.532608695652174

Academy Award winner Anthony Hopkins plays Dr. Ethan Powell, a primatologist turned murderer, while Gooding plays Theo Caulder, a young psychiatrist who must unlock the secrets in Powell's mind and unravel the mysteries behind his unusual killings. As the truth comes to light, we learn about how Dr. Powell had become estranged from his family only to take solace in a family of a different kind in the wild. In the process, both men take a journey of self-discovery, not unlike the one taken by millions of Ishmael readers in [[ASIN:0553375407 Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit</a>

1049882,4,6305608253,"I finally got an opportunity to see this movie after 10 years of renting it at the local blockbuster but never getting around to sticking it in my DVD player.  Nonetheless, I was very impressed and moved by this movie right around the point of the film where Anthony Hopkins starts speaking to Cuba Gooding Jr.  I will jump right to the main points of interest and themes this movie represented beautifully.  Personally speaking I feel the main theme of this movie was driven home when Powell (Hopkins) made it a point to invoke Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding) the concept of control as an illusion.  That point was further driven home involving the scene where Hopkins coins and incorporates the word ""takers"" into his speaking throughout the movie.  Another interesting part was the scene where Powell was sketching an illustration of the history of the universe in his jail cell pointing out hunter-gatherers, ""takers"", and explaining that takers feel the word dominion is the answer.  Aside from these philosophical blips you see a slow progression of peace and harmony represented in the gymnasium versus the discord and favoritism thwarted by the correctional officers in the beginning of the movie.  In essence Hopkins grew an appreciation, admiration, and awareness of life being inundated with gorillas versus humans.  The gorillas essentially gave him an understanding of peace and harmony existing in our universe, and everyone in humanity has an opportunity to see it if they stopped getting caught up in constant illusions (dominion, greed, panic, fear, ambition, etc).",1199750400,2,1578,5.13671875

My main reason for writing is the inane comments here and fear with reality that pervades our society.  Those who can't, don't or won't appreciate (at least) the marvelous, insightful messages here are possibly the very ones that assure nothing will ever change much .  Scary to shed light on bare essence of humanity's inhumanity and its inability to rise above the systematic base obsessions of power, control and coveting; whether rationalized with all the reasons that endorse continuing to man's lower instincts or from fear of looking beyond the security of ignorance.  It is amazing that the natural order of things may be better balanced and have a wisdom beyond anything man may attain, as he seeks to control nature and fellow man while failing miserably at controlling himself, even with all his knowledge and tech, to a point equal or beyond the inherent natural wisdom of (so called)lower species.

Have some fun and enjoy this movie.  It is powerful and as perfect as it gets in addressing very intriguing human societal conundrums while offering quality performances from a great cast on numerous levels.

The film is simple enough, but does a great job of describing people's every day lives and the problems they face.  It just goes to show that simplicity is often far better than complexity, when trying to present issues of a human nature.

In such cases, 'Instinct' becomes more than just another trip through Hollywood; shifting instead into a life altering event.

There was nothing that indicated the precariousness of civilization - ""takers"" are mentioned but it comes across more as you just don't know what you are missing by being one - not that all of nature has had it. Heck, the movie makers would be shooting their own business in the foot if they were really to try and convince us to head back to the trees. But of course that was the main point of ""Ishmael"".

But, what Hopkins has to teach us is that we are not in control, but we simply hold onto our illusions of control.  When our illusions are threatened we become angry and frightened because we are afraid of the reality.  Ever wonder why we are so disturbed about a home invasion?  Is it because someone came in, or because we had built up an illusion that we were safe, and now that illusion is gone?

This is a deeply moving story about an anthropologist who leaves everything behind and lives with a group of gorillas - we get glimpses of that life later in movie. The beginning of the movie is a portrait of him as a madman, who doesn't speak, and has killed two park rangers. He is transported to the U.S. and awaits trial in a prison for the criminally insane. Cuba Gooding Jr. is a psychiatrist who is trying to get him to come out of his shell and speak. Cuba Gooding Jr's performance is the stand out in this awe inspring movie.

For fear of giving too much away, I won't say much more. I will say, however, that this movie is not so much about the crime itself. It is more about the transforming nature of love and respect and, ultimately, the meaning of freedom.

Noted anthropologist Ethan Powell (Anthony Hopkins) was reported missing in the jungles of Africa and lost for almost two years.  It was said that he was walking amongst the gorillas that he was studying.  Then he murdered a couple of game wardens with a wooden club.  Now he has been returned to the United States and placed in the mental ward of a prison where he refuses to speak.  The case is discussed by a pair of shrinks: Dr. Ben Hillard (Donald Sutherland), who is old and wise, and Dr. Theo Caulder (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), who is young and smart.  Hillard engages briefly in deep thought and then muses: ""He lives with the animals, takes on their behavior, and becomes one.  How does that happen?""
Of course that is what the movie is about, and young Dr. Caulder is going to go have a series of confrontational sessions with Dr. Powell in prison, get him to talk, and eventually find out the answers to the big question.  But as soon as Hillard articulated the big question I had my hand up because I was pretty sure I knew the answer.  I mean I saw ""Gorillas in the Midst"" but even without that big clue common sense would pretty much tell you why somebody studying primates in the jungle would favor the apes and side with them against human beings.  There might be some surprises in terms of the details, but certainly the general idea here is clear even before we actually ""learn"" the answer.  However, to be fair, this film gets credit for not having a sexual relationship develop between young Dr. Caulder and Powell's daughter Lyn (Maura Tierney),
Will Anthony Hopkins staring at an inquisitor in a prison setting it is hard not to see parallels between ""Instinct"" and ""Silence of the Lambs.""  Caulder admits at one point that he has become a student as well as a therapist and this 1999 film is one where the patient may well do more for the doctor than the other way around.  Added to this film are your standard roster of prison goons, apathetic doctors, and eccentric prisoner-patients in a simplistic combining of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" and ""One Flew Over the Cukoo's Nest.""  Consequently Caulder not only has to bring Powell back to sanity and his family, but has to fight to reform the corrupt system that he finds.
The extras on this DVD consist of the trailer for ""Instinct,"" as a reminder that it was a lot better than the actual movies, and then pictures of other movies you could have watched instead of this one.  Apparently someone in a decision-making capacity recognized that most people watching this movie were probably to hit the eject button as soon as the credits, so why waste time and money adding extras nobody was going to want to see?",1079049600,2,2789,4.583501006036217

I have just finished reading Ishmael by Quinn (which I wouldn't have known of hadn't it been for this movie), and I must say that Instinct's scriptwriter has done an excellent job of creating a story *based* on the thoughts of the book but making it so much more interesting and dramatic. The movie has IMPACT. It caught my attention when I saw the trailer on TV, and I knew I had to watch it, and I *drank* it in like I had longed for it for ages.
It's a beautiful, excellent movie.",1073779200,2,604,4.307017543859649
1050057,5,6305608253,"This is an intriguing film, not so much because of its improbable story line, but because of its intelligent and provocative interest in ideas that are hardly mainstream. Those of us involved with the environmental movement are often exasperated by the unknowing and unfeeling arrogant presumption of natural superiority many human leaders seem to have regarding use and disposition of the world's resources, both natural and otherwise. In this thoughtful film Sir Anthony Hopkins brings his prestige to bear on such heady issues, and forwards an undeniable argument regarding those presumptions.
The format of the movie is such that it is necessary to piece together this message, and this is the service that Cuba Gooding provides here as the bearer of logic and modern thought, presuming to examine Hopkins character for mental defect due to the extreme nature of Hopkins outside the mental hospital he is now ensconced in.  Yet the evolving dialogue and plot as it slowly builds is really the uncovering of the ways in which such arrogance and presumptive claims for natural stewardship over the natural order are laid bare for what they are, groundless and silly.
Of course, the fact that such ideas are expressed in a movie made for popular consumption is rare enough, but to do so with a message that is clearly enunciated and not overlaid with the weight of its own dramatic detritus is very powerful indeed.  The director is clearly warning us that our misuse and rape of the environment has terrible consequences, but unfortunately not just for us or for humankind, but rather for the whole ecological superstructure on which life on this planet depends.  The idea that we are false ""Gods' and false prophets is made chillingly clear by some of Hopkins monologues.
The plot is unusual but not all that plausible; it is unlikely anyone who found his way back to nature would return under any circumstances. Indeed, one of the more profound undercurrents of the classic Edgar Rice Burroughs series of Tarzan novels was the way in which he (Burroughs) constantly counter-posed the rather Victorian idea of the superiority and infallibility of Human progress and civilization on the one hand with the predictably calamitous results of that civilization on the other. Hopkins does much the same thing here, but with much more articulate and even profound use of language and story. This is a very interesting and worthwhile movie, and one I highly recommend. Enjoy!",1032307200,10,2470,5.049019607843137
1050058,5,6305608253,"INSTINCT has all the components that a great movie should have in my opinion: an early hook, top knotch camera work/direction, a stellar cast, well developed characters and a nicely paced, interesting plot along with plenty of passion and emotion portrayed. INSTINCT gives the viewer bite-sized, puzzle pieces which can be interpreted different ways. The viewer can think and also absorb the information given but can't predict the outcome. INSTINCT ties the story together beautifully with many twists and turns and an interesting, unexpected ending. I personally enjoy a movie which doesn't end sappy but instead, ends with Hope.
Kudos to who casted this movie! Dr. Theo Caulder's Desire and Drive so amply played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. is skillfully contrasted with Dr. Ethan Powell's (Hopkins) deep, dark secrets. What a duo they make--they have Chemistry--the magic so rarely seen on the screen. I was thinking near the beginning of the movie that there was no way that Hopkins could top his performance in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS but he did. He's one of my favorite actors of all time. He makes his characters real and him playing Dr. Ethan Powell is no exception. I've never seen a movie with him in it that I didn't like. And what can I say? Cuba Gooding, Jr. nailed his part.  I can't think of anyone who was more suitable to play Theo. Casting is so important! Donald Sutherland plays the mentor/boss of Theo (Gooding, Jr.); I'm so impressed with every word he spoke and how he said it--he's a seasoned, polished actor. Maura Tierney, who plays the daughter of Dr. Ethan Powell (Hopkins) portrayed both longing and love as well as strength, patience and acceptance.
BOTTOM LINE: INSTINCT is a tantalizing, thought-provoking film with much to offer the viewer. If you are a fan of Hopkins, Gooding or Sutherland and/or like psychological thrillers with powerful, emotional intensity and a lesson to learn, buy this. I rate this a 9/10.
Watch the movie to get the compelling answer to the question in the title and take many ideas with you to ponder.",1029715200,19,2057,4.877142857142857
1050059,5,6305608253,"Instinct is simply the most under-rated movie of all time. Hopkins and Gooding gave us great performances that were backed up by the talented supporting cast of Maura Tierney, Donald Sutherland, John Ashton, George Dzundza, and Doug Spinuzza.
It's too bad that most people who watch Instinct really don't understand the message, because it is one of the most important messages of all time. The message is that humans need to stop acting like we are gods, and give up the delusion that we are the masters of the universe.
How can such an awful film like Fargo gets praised left and right as one of the best, while this incredible masterpiece called Instinct goes unnoticed? Don't know? They are called CRITICS. Critics are generally people who have seen so many films, that they are burnt out, and try to analyze films in ways they never did when they truly enjoyed movies. They tend to develop a distaste for entertaining movies, and a taste for bizarre or boring films. Once some of the top critics blasted Instinct, it didn't have a chance. The domino effect took over, and a movie that I thought was destined to be hailed as one of the best, was very quickly stomped into obscurity.
How can this movie be so often described as derivative by the exact same people who praise one of the most derivative movies of all time, called The Shawshank Redemption? Watch Shawshank right after watching Escape from Alcatraz, and you should see what I mean. Was it King, or was it a writer for Shawshank the movie that stole those ideas and scenes? I don't know.
We all have opinions, and mine aren't any better than yours; but when a movie that has the entertainment, acting, writing, and messages of the caliber that Instinct does, can be successfully portrayed by the so-called experts as a horrible film, then you know something screwy is going on. Just watch this masterpiece, and do it with an open mind. From the words of Ethan Powell, played by Anthony Hopkins: `Are you free?' Not many of us are.",1019433600,7,1996,4.657223796033994

This movie pressed some buttons, and I was frequently in tears as it touched on issues of family and human nature.  I was amazed that Hopkins character was so clearly distinguished from Dr. Lector - because it seemed otherwise such a repeat in the trailers - once I saw it.  Many a critic pronounced it another Lector character, which shows their haste - only someone who must rush through so many movies to review could miss its greatness.

In particular, the fact that AH's character was accepted not as one of the gorillas but as a human.

Unfortunately, the filmmakers were so afraid that their subject matter was too complicated for the average movie goer that they felt it necessary to review the same obvious conclusion over and over. This is demonstrated by their refusal to even vary the language, lest we be confused about who the 'takers' are. Had this movie assumed the audience is capable of following rational thought, it could have provided some unique insight and commentary regarding issues of society and control in general. Instead, the movie never moves beyond conclusions reached in the first 30 minutes, which overall, makes it little more than a very average, very boring film.",983750400,3,781,4.924242424242424

But a large part of Instinct is a suspense story, as a young hot-shot psychiatrist tries to find out why Hopkins' character murdered two park rangers in Africa, and frankly, it wasn't suspenseful at all. I thought surely there would be some twist from the obvious explanation, but it never came. Still, the movie maintained interest in the characters, and for that it is worth seeing. I couldn't help feeling that I was seeing a cross between One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Gorillas In the Mist, and Silence of the Lambs. If that sounds like an intriguing blend to you, you will likely find that this is a movie worth seeing. The music by Danny Elfman was quite good (although unobtrusive) especially that of the opening credits.

1050107,1,6305608253,"I knew I was in trouble when the opening credits of the film said it was based on the book ""Ishmael"" by Daniel Quinn, which is a new age guide to living in fiction form about a talking ape imparting the wisdom of the world to the protagonist. (No, really! Look it up in the book section here at Amazon.)
How does this relate to a movie about a psychologist helping prisoners and a biologist accused of murder after he apparently spends too much time with great apes? Good question.
If I had to guess, I'd theorize that the screenwriter who originally sold this script had a probably very good script about a prison psychologist that he couldn't get sold -- those segments of the film, in fact, are what make it barely watchable. But after getting it turned down, time and again, he must have encountered someone who was a fan of the ""Ishmael"" book and perversely decided to rework his script into a very, very, very loose adaptation of that work in order to get his prison story on screen.
But this film is a train wreck. The prison scenes float in isolation, surrounded by ridiculous acting by characters we can't identify as being remotely human, given how underwritten they are. Gooding's character's eventual reaction to the lessons he learns from Hopkins' character seems to come out of nowhere, unless you know that the book actually had a lot more being imparted. Otherwise ""it's bad to kill mother gorillas"" is hardly a profound conclusion.
Don't even bother renting this turkey. This is something to watch, briefly, when it's on TV for free. There are loads of better films about psychologists and prisons. Watching this in lieu of ""The Shawshank Redemption"" would be a crime.",975542400,12,1685,4.695945945945946

Upon his return, he becomes the subject of psychological scrutiny by  newbie psychiatrist Cuba Gooding Jr who attempts to build a ""therapeutic"" rapport with his character to unravel the motives of the murders.
The real  irony is the way Hopkin's character protected that which he studied while neglecting his own offspring.  A  thought provoking look at human nature,  ""civilized culture"" and the reality (or illusion?)  of ""freedom"". Hopkins  saves this movie and delivers his usual great performance.

I should have known, Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. have yet to dissappoint me.
The story is about an anthropologist that has been charged with when considered missing, killing several park rangers.  He is sent back to the states and imprisoned.  They assume he is insane.  It appears he was missing because he was living with the apes for 2 years.
A young up and coming psychiatrist in training, chomps at the bit to find out what makes this man tick.  Of course he rocks the boat in the daily grind of a prison system.  The tricks and compromises of a established prison system dealing with deranged prisoners is medieval in the eyes of a newcomer.
This young psychiatrist is charged with finding ""What happened?"" to this noted professor.  Why did he kill those rangers, what was he doing with the apes?  Things progess a bit more rapidly than reality would probably dictate, but you get the answers Cuba Gooding Jr.'s character is looking for.  They might not be what you expected.
I thought the acting was magnificent.  They are a wonderful counterpoint to one another: Anthony Hopkin's intensity and Cuba Gooding Jr.'s exhuberance.

Hopkins stars as a research  anthropologist who abandons family, home and, eventually, sanity to take up  residence, Sigourney Weaver-style, with a family of apes that, of course,  just welcome him fully into their ersatz anthropoid family unit. While he's  making nicey-nice with the gorillas, a band of hunters attacks the camp,  killing most of their number, a crime for which he is returned to the  states in a strange state of self-imposed silence. Gooding jr. plays the  crack psychiatrist assigned to work with this violently deranged man and  attempt to draw the truth from him about what really happened in the deep  dark jungles of Africa.
Any movie that begins with the cerebral Hopkins  singlehandedly demolishing an entire airport terminal, while scores of  armed guards struggle to subdue him, is not destined to register high on  the credibility meter. The screenplay, in fact, degenerates into a  snail-paced series of increasingly ludicrous confrontations between the  deranged killer and the doctor, wherein the psychiatrist, predictably, is  set straight on some eternal verities by the psychotic truth teller. How  often must we be subjected to this idiotic notion that all therapists are  really only trying to work out their own redemptions and that the deeply  emotionally disturbed patients somehow possess the requisite wisdom we mere  rational mortals do not to help them achieve this? The film trods this  tried-and-true path right up to a thoroughly wretched final scene that  defies all credibility and lapses completely into the absurd. At one point,  to achieve his redemption, Gooding Jr. rallies the psychotic prisoners to  band together and stand up against the tyrranical prison forces arrayed  against them - in a scene filled with the kind of phony emotional uplift  that is always backed up by a swelling, sobbing orchestral composition and  endless shots of characters looking meaningfully upward in teary-eyed pride  and determination. If only Jack Nicholson had had such an advocate!
Cuba  Gooding Jr., though he certainly tries hard, lacks the gravitas necessary  to carry off a leading role of this magnitude, and Hopkins provides his  customary grating mannerisms as he lectures us about the virtues of  uncivilized, primitive Man. ""Instinct"" is thoroughly derivative  yet it does have the chutzpah to make momentary fun of itself by including  Sigourney Weaver as the butt of a one-liner. It is the one moment of  cleverness, honesty and courage in an otherwise dull, incredible and  utterly uninteresting film.",964742400,8,2839,5.256696428571429

There is something  about this movie for me: I feel like I'm sensing the seed of something  very, very good that didn't quite come to fruition, despite what on the  surface seems to be a season filler kind of movie.  There's something more  there (I wish the people involved could give it a few more tries--oh well).  But that not yet really well developed ""something,"" the promise  that seems to be inherent in this movie, is compelling enough for me to buy  it.

And for anyone interested  in a story based on a real-life experience with the mountain gorillas, I'd  highly recommend *Gorillas in the Mist*, based on Dian Fossey's  experiences.

1050310,3,6305608253,"Normally, before watching a movie, I would want to know who the cast is, who the director is, & also the production team to ensure a great nite entertainment.  Well, this movie is from Mandalay, & thus, a little bit  of Alan Guber magic is expected.  The credential for ""Instinct""  is almost flawless but after sitting thru the movie for 2 hours, I was  feeling indifferent despite there were good moments in the movie.  The  messages about human losing touch with nature, our propensity to destroy  the beauty around us, the issue about freedom & control were discussed  here.  However, the intensity that were expected between Anthony Hopkins  & Cuba Gooding Jr never percipitated.  The gorillas happened to be the  star of the show but then again, are they real considering that Stan  Winston, the special effect guy who brought us the Alien creature is  credited with special effect here?  Pretty convincing stuff.  One couldn't  help noticing ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest""'s element in the  movie, though.  Subsequently, I couldn't help noticing that the movie  failed to focus onto one issue but trying to be a bit of everything.  The  storyline gave the movie a strong foundation to concentrate upon the 2 main  characters but it failed to deliver big time.  Maura Tierney was given  limited screen time anyway & she was simply there to add a female  element into the movie & nothing more.  Donald Sutherland simply had  the presence & I wished he was given more opportunity to display his  acting brilliance.  John Ashton (who was one of the merry bunch in Beverly  Hills Cops with Eddie Murphy) seemed to be comfortable in his role as a  prison warden.  Overall, I still think that the movie is rather predictable  as expected from Hollywood.  In summary, a guy going nuts (other believe so  anyway),  a shrink trying to prove that he's the smartest kid on the block  & along the way felt for the guy & thus, trying to help him, the  guy is getting fed up with the world that it has become & tries to  protect the unprotected from any harm & along the way, they felt for  the guy too, the guy finally realises that there's more to it to life  rather than holding old grudges, the shrink & the guy's daughter is  happy because the guy has got his final redemption.

Gooding is excellent in an entirely color & gender-blind role.  It  might as easily have been played by a woman, an Asian, a Caucasian--anyone.  Those roles are rare in Hollywood, and their creation should be  encouraged. The mystery and the message: a little predictable, but moving  and credible.  (The critic who thinks the climax unbelievable should read  the newspaper from several years back when a similar event occurred in  reality--unfortunately with a less satisfactory outcome.)

In my opinion the character of Hopkins (who gave an incredible performance as always) is entitled to defend the Gorrila's. Why should a  human life be worth more then the life of a Gorrila. There is only a couple  of them left and millions and millions of us. We are the vermin of this  earth.

There's one simple way to tell if a  movie is a classic.. if you go away taking a piece of the movie and its  message with you.  And for me, that was one of ""Instinct's""  finest qualities.  I was moved by the way they got the message through  involving Hopkins and the Gorillas.  The truth within that brought a  million emotions out that were inside me. (btw I am an Animal Rights  Activist and Vegan)  I'm so glad that the movie touched on the subject of  humans destroying helpless animals' families and environment.

You can't watch this movie thinking about the accomplishments of the stars Anthony Hopkins and Cuba Gooding Jr. or compare their performances in other  movies. You'll miss it. You have to focus on the story and the characters.  Look past the impeccable grooming of Anthony Hopkins as a prisoner. After  all prisoners don't have much to do. May be that's what he does to past  time. Gooding seemed to be overacting, but that's what the part required,  an ambitious psychiatrist trying to make a name for himself. Even after he  becomes involved his training as a psychiatrist persisted. After all it's  hard to give up what has taken us so long to learn.

He has, but he plays the ""psycho""  role better than anyone else and I'd like to see some more movies where he  plays a lunatic.  The story is great and very entertaining.  From this  movie, we learn some lessons about human culture.  Men are controllers and  tyrants. They take what they want and do what they want without thinking or  realizing what the consequences may be.  This can be applied to many things  from the destruction of the rain forests, without regard to animals, to the  depletion of the ozone layer to further industrialization to nuclear war.

The other  characters, the professor, the warden, etc. however are pretty flat, and  very predictable. Overall I think the production is typical Hollywood fare,  one thing that annoyed me is how nice hopkins hair looked after being in  jail for over a year, I guess they had a salon in there?

What started as an interesting premise, the film quickly demises into a preachy load of gobbledygook. Hopkins plays an  anthropologist who has been missing in Africa for a number of years. After  killing 2 game wardens he is captured and sent back the United States.  Enter resident psychiatrist Cuba Gooding, Jr.
The film delves into some  crazy sublots and uses way too many cliches. Why is it that every prison  warden is a sadomasochist in the movies? Plus there is the ultra violent  head prison guard. For a minute I thought we were at Shawshank.
Then  there is the troubling premise of what exactly is murder and when is it  warranted. Bring on the animal-rights W####os, but, I don't feel the murder  of a gorilla gives someone the right to kill a human in return. The movie  tries to force feed us with that notion. Atleast it places the gorillas'  lives equal with our's as human. ..animal-rights activism will not  win me over.
