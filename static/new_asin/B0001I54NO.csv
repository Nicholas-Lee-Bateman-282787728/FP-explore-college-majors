8181485,5,B0001I54NO,This DVD set has been an excellent tool to teach the history of Rock n Roll to my 7th and 8th Grade Music classroom. Thank you very much.,1296950400,,137,3.9285714285714284
8181486,3,B0001I54NO,"I bought this hoping that it would be a collection from the ""Shebang"" show that Kasem hosted in the 60's on KTLA Channel 5 in L.A.  Alas this collection contains nothing from this program. However what it does contain is sourced from many other TV music shows such as ""Hullabaloo"" and ""The Beat Club"". And this isn't such a bad thing except for the fact that I've seen these clips in much better quality in other collections. I would purchase it if you don't otherwise own these clips and if you can find it for under $30.",1259539200,2,522,4.381443298969073
8181487,4,B0001I54NO,"I'm not going to leave a long-winded review like some others have done. But i do have to say that this DVD set is definitely worth the money. You get a whole lot of music that's for sure.  Some of these clips are very rare and hard to find elsewhere. Also, there is a great mix of genres of music and different artists, more than enough to keep you entertained. Bottom line; you get five DVDs, packed with some of the greatest artists of our time, and all for about $50.00. You can't beat that with a stick. BUY IT!",1085356800,15,515,4.15
8181488,1,B0001I54NO,"40 or so minutes per disk of footage mainly taken from German TV. Experimental camera techniques have not dated well. Content is widely available elsewhere at much better value for your money, compilation probably put together by an accountant.",1084924800,37,244,5.282051282051282
8181489,5,B0001I54NO,"Man, this set has it all...from roots to stems to branches to leaves...the Family Tree of Rock and Roll is well represented, but I have to say that what first caught my eye was the stunning cover art...brilliant!!!  I love the cover of the Soul DVD!  But the actual DVDs were dreamy...and harkened me back to a time when I was young, wild, and sweatin' at the sock hop!  WHOOOAH-PAH!",1078790400,8,383,4.442857142857143
