8272266,5,B00197PP08,"Sitting in my comfortable living room watching, I couldn't believe the danger in which the film makers put themselves to bring the anguish of Liberia and its citizens to a wider audience.  The footage is nothing short of astonishing as the camera navigates numerous gun battles to bring us to the heart of this, the second of two devastating civil wars.  I later watched PRAY THE DEVIL BACK TO HELL and was astonished to find how much of its footage was actually taken from LIBERIA--AN UNCIVIL WAR (I'm not implying improper use; I'm certain all due credit was given).  I applaud the directors and cameramen of this remarkable documentary for having the courage not to shy away from one of the most dreadful conflicts of the last forty years.",1251244800,15,742,4.736434108527132
