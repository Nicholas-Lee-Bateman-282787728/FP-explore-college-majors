7799319,5,1580024343,"An excellent introduction to and summary of devotion to the Infant of Prague on a 30-minute DVD.

Bob and Penny Lord have left so many wonderful books and DVDs about Jesus, Mary, the Saints, and miracles. I have watched them for years on EWTN.  Others carry on their ""Journeys of Faith"" ministry.

Probably the most well known promoter of this devotion was the Carmelite Fr. Cyril of Prague (Venerable Father Cyril of the Mother of God). We hear on the DVD that in becoming a Carmelite he desired to follow in the footsteps of St. Teresa of Avila and St. John of the Cross (His Feast is today). But things were not going well at the beginning of his Religious Life and he was filled with depression and anxiety. Upon praying before a statue of the Infant, he said his depression lifted. Later, when a Protestant army came into Prague, they ransacked the churches. Upon seeing the Infant of Prague statue, one of the soldier's called it ""The Pope's doll"" and cut off the statue's hands, throwing them behind the church. But the prayers of the Carmelites brought peace to Prague.

Later, in praying before the Infant, Venerable Cyril said the statue came to life and said to him:

""Be kind to Me and I will be kind to you. Give Me back My Hands which were cut off by the heretics. The more you honor Me, the more I will bless you.""

We also learn on the DVD that the Shrine in Prague has a sister church in Arenzano, Italy, in the Archdiocese of Milan. The Infant of Prague has over 70 beautiful garments now, 1 made by the Empress Maria Teresa of Austria.",1481673600,,1554,4.435087719298245
