8143805,5,B000I2KQPE,"The Pursuit of Happinness has been one of the most creative, tightest, and sincerest bands to come out of Toronto ,Canada...since Rush!  They never fail to entertain,surprise and improve on their solid form of RocknRoll ,no matter how many times you see them! From the first chord, the wanting Wail of Voice and Guitars grabs you by the balls!,and takes you on a ride that you never wqnt for it to end! TPOH is not just a band that needs to get their music out but,We need their music to enjoy for years to come! Sincerely, Stormin Normin ,Detroit RocknRoll!!!",1423094400,,560,4.6
8143806,5,B000I2KQPE,"TPOH was definitely one of my favorite bands in the 90s. I never was able to see them live though, since by the time I became a huge fan of theirs after their 3rd album ""The Downward Road"" was released, they no longer toured in the US.  So this DVD release containing a concert from '93, and all of their music videos from the first 2 albums, is a definite must for all past and present fans.  The concert, where they are playing at a ski resort, doesn't seem to be complete (unless they only played for around 35 minutes) but its top quality video and the sound quality is great.  Great set list too, with several from Downward Road and their earlier modern rock hits. The music videos are a real joy to watch.  Don't hesitate, pick this up!",1316995200,,742,4.2785714285714285
8143807,4,B000I2KQPE,"TPOH is a woefully underappreciated Canadian rock band that had its brief Stateside success with the song ""I'm an Adult Now"" in the late 1980's.  This DVD showcases the band in an outdoor concert in their native Canada in what looks like 20 degree Fahrenheit weather.  Good songs, catchy hooks, and plenty of attitude.  Given the temperature at the show, I'm glad I watched it in my living room instead of in person.

What also makes this a good concert video is the lighting -- mostly plain white light that showcases the band in vibrant cinematography and natural-looking light rather than bathing them in multi-colored stage lights just for theatricality's sake.",1227398400,,665,4.963963963963964
8143808,4,B000I2KQPE,"""As much as she'd like to believe, she's leading a brand new way...""  This band is quirky and fun and the show on this DVD is a good one.  The thing I like so much about TPOH is their vocal harmonies.  There's a certain sound that the female backing singers create when their voices combine.  The sound has what I call a ""pleading"" quality.  Abba had it.  I wish I knew the right terms to describe it.  If you like TPOH, you'll enjoy the concert.  If not, you might enjoy it anyway!",1222732800,4,482,4.163043478260869
