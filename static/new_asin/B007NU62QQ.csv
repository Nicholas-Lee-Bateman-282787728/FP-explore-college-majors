5100308,4,B007NU62QQ,"I liked the Meditation Prep section with Yee and the Mindful Meditation section with Maritza. I had a problem with the Refresh section with Yee. In that section I found both the narration and the music too distracting so had to eventually just turn it off/eject. As a result, I recommend only 2 of the 3 sections on the DVD. Would have given 3 1/2 stars if possible.",1385337600,6,366,4.397058823529412

5100311,5,B007NU62QQ,"This is very good combination of stretching, relaxation and initiation to meditation. Each part can be done separatelly with about 20 min each, or done together. The speed of Maritza's narration and her calm guidenance is really nice.",1360022400,6,234,5.184210526315789

8519778,2,B007NU62QQ,"I listened for the first time 'Mindful Meditation' narrated by Marzita. After just a few minutes I had to stop it because of the background music, in particular a warbling flute, it often drowns out the narration and I found it distracting and annoying. I wish  there was a way to cut the background music. Since I bought this a month ago I can no longer return it. My suggestion would be to turn the volume down where you can just barely hear the narrator. The flute music decreases as you get further into the meditation so if you can get past the beginning, you might find this useful.",1463875200,7,588,4.394495412844036
