The reason I took off was because of the stupid romance in the  second episode on this tape.  It really got on my nerves when in the middle  of the big battle they have this long romantic pause.  Plus it just seemed  like it was there to take up space, and it sort of got on my nerves.  Other  then that the tape was great, and I really think that this series is one of  the better anime series out at the time.",969235200,,569,3.8947368421052633
7887548,4,6305293961,"When I got this video subtitled I was a little bit doubtful. But my doubt are now past me and the verdict is in, this is still a great series even with the subtitles! I am not a big fan of subtitled animes but hearing the  actual voices is just as funny sometimes as the better comical moments. The  animation has to be to be the best yet in this series. The action has also  really picked the pace in this volume. The downsides to this volume is
1.  It costs more than the dubbed version
2. Still nothing about the Dark  sorcerer we saw in episodes 2,3,and 8.
3. Only two episodes!
Yet if  you can put aside these cons the pros are worth it. Thhis volume is really  only for fans of the series or for people whom love Fantasy! Warning This  volume contains Violence, Language, and some Mature Themes.",961286400,,801,4.223684210526316
