8596715,1,B00DRP7R8I,"This was worse than a high school video production. Nothing more than a long commercial/marketing tool for the realtor that produced/stars/wrote this piece of garbage. From the poor editing, content, lack of historical facts, poor questioning, lack of depth, and so on... I was really looking forward to viewing this, as an Eichler owner, and a fan of Mid-Century Modern architecture.  So disappointing. Don't be tricked, this is not a documentary. I feel bad for some of the people interviewed, they were conned into making a commercial without being paid.",1483228800,,557,5.188888888888889
8596716,4,B00DRP7R8I,"The film talked about Eichler and why people were -- and still are --  attracted to these homes.  There were also  numerous photographs and glimpses inside the homes during the interviews.  If you expect to see an on-screen tour of homes, you may be disappointed; however, this film offers so much more to enthusiasts.",1459123200,,318,4.833333333333333

8596718,1,B00DRP7R8I,"Warning! Don't waste your $2.00 on this video. It's just what the title says: the people, not the houses. It was so boring that I could not stand listening to the monotone of the people and stop watching. Even deleted it from my video library. I would not even give it a star.",1436227200,3,276,4.226415094339623

8596721,4,B00DRP7R8I,Eichler was a genius in his ability to design and build beautiful homes for middle class families. This book explains how and why.,1414886400,2,130,4.695652173913044
8596722,5,B00DRP7R8I,"One day, I'd love to own an Eichler. Growing up in Southern California in the '50s and '60s, I look at everything midcentury modern with fondness, but nothing beats this architect's vision and execution of the most unique and affordable (at the time!) homes. This documentary tells the story of Eichler himself (surprising), several homeowners ( endearing) and the interviews with his son and grandson really took it over the top for me. Anyone fortunate enough to own one of these homes, or just has an interest in midcentury architecture, should love it.",1376611200,7,556,4.989247311827957
