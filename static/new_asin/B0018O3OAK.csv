I wish that there were more than 51 eps in total (the show caught up to the manga and they didn't want to make filler eps, so they stopped at the end of the story arch)",1266969600,3,335,3.625
8270168,5,B0018O3OAK,"Some people seem to be wondering why this product is discontinued.  Well just as a heads up this series is licensed by funimation and the first dvd should be coming out around spring '10.  And if anybody is wondering they have quite a few episodes streaming online to watch with eng subs on the funimation website.

As for my review, I highly recommend this series.  Awesome animation, great voice acting (as far as the japanese dub goes), and a unique and intriguing storyline.",1254787200,5,478,4.72289156626506
8270169,5,B0018O3OAK,"This is probably one of my favorite anime series so far. Although only 51 episodes, it does have a satisfying ending that won't leave too many of those questions that usually come with short series.

I'm pretty surprised that it's been discontinued as well. If they have taken it off Youtube, and you still want to see it and can't find anywhere else to buy it, I'd suggest trying Megavideo.com. They have the whole series on there, at least for now.

8270170,5,B0018O3OAK,"seeing how Soul Eater is one of the hottest new items in the anime/manga world WHY is this discontinued?  The graphics are amazing, the series borders between drama and humor and has tons of creativity, again WHY IS THIS DISCONTINUED? Is someone planning on picking up the title again? What a freaking pain, they've taken it off of Youtube as well. how am i supposed to watch Soul Eater now?",1237507200,3,391,4.585714285714285
