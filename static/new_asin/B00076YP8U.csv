My 5 year old boy loves these programs. The first two were so enjoyed I bought the rest of the series.
This was a series on tv at one time, apparently. I hope they package the rest of the programs because the show was fab.
Each dvd has 4 episodes that are somewhat related. The 2 kid hosts explore different aspects of each subject.
Some are surprising but all are interesting, informative and professionally made.
In earlier reviews of this series I forgot to mention that grown ups find these programs interesting as well.
My husband and I love them as well.",1260057600,,811,6.052173913043478
8045226,5,B00076YP8U,"It's so cool! Once you get to learn stuff off of Popular Mechanics for Kids Extreme Sports, you might end up even wanting to do extreme sports or make up your own. I learned a lot from watching it. I learned what a road rash is and there are a lot of cool scenes that make me want to watch the disc over and over again.
