This video features the videos (except for Opposites Attract) from the Forever Your Girl album.
The videos are Knocked Out, The Way That You Love Me (Version 1), Straight Up, Cold Hearted, Forever Your Girl, & The Way That You Love Me (Version 2), plus it also includes commentary from Paula about the videos.
I would recommend this to Paula fans! Brings back memories when Paula was all over MTV with these videos!",1088985600,7,465,4.5476190476190474

There's lots of great footage that shows choreography, behind the scene look at her videos and concert material.  It also contains the following videos:
""Knocked Out"" (1988) Great video considering its 15 years old -
""The Way That You Love Me"" (Version One) (1988)  Lots of great dancing, this video has never been release to tv -
""Straight Up"" (1989)  Excellent video, winner of 4 MTV Video Music Awards -
""Forever Your Girl"" (1989) A very fun video, lots of dancing on this one -
""Cold Hearted""  (1989)  An awesome video, probably one of Paula's best videos of all time -
""The Way That You Love Me"" (Version Two) (1990)  This video shows all of Paula's beauty - No Dancing
