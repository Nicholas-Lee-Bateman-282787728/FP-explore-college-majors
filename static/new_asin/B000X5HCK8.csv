It is a must  have, given the perils of today with the spousal abuse and  the lost of a child from an accident etc.... and by some twist of fate meeting someone with a child and falling in love with the very person, who was unaware of the fact that the accident was caused by them.  This is a must see DVD it's so touching you will cry but there are some light moments, it leaves you thinking and searching in your heart as to what would you do in similar circumstances.",1410825600,,598,4.0
8325879,4,B000X5HCK8,My friend gave me this T.V. series and I couldn't stop watching it. It's very moving and the twists and turns will hold your attention the whole time. It's a great mix of sadness and humor. The cast was absolutely great together. If you like a good drama then I recommend you get this series.,1220572800,,292,4.327272727272727
