637479,4,6303400396,"This DVD is focused more on the historical aspect of Da Vinci's life. It is very comprehensive and will give you great detail about his life. I really recommend this DVD to any Renaissance fan or anybody that want to witness our true potential as human beings. Da Vinci invented the parachute before people could fly or even thought about it...
I was in particular fascinated about the extra material in this two DVD package, offered a more artistic information about his masterpieces.
Any Da Vinci fan will love this DVD although I think it still does not truly reflect the maestro's legacy.",1074297600,13,592,4.757281553398058
637480,3,6303400396,"I found this video insightful towards Leonardos life, but much is based on speculation and made-up scenarios. After studying Leonardos life for years, I've learned that this video only captures a small portion of leonardos life, missing soo many important documented discoveries he made. The video also misses his complex cognitive processes which is documented in his notebooks and what is truely favored by most people. The video lacks in many dimensions but is a good beginners introduction into the meistros life.",1037577600,13,517,5.317073170731708
637481,3,6303400396,"Although the reviewers seem to like this film a lot, the Italians did not do any justice with this overlong version of the famous artist. It presents him as a callous and distant man, somewhat obsessed by a hatred toward his natural father. In contrast, there is enough documentation that proves him as a very gregarious individual who did a lot for his friends! Then the film lacks his accomplishments as an inventor, and the one obscure but very fun part of his life: In Milan, he was in charge of food services; Leonardo invented the modern eating utensils we use today. Therefore, he had little time to paint. A silly outdated version, where is a good studio when you need one.",999734400,5,681,4.590163934426229
637482,5,6303400396,"Like the reviewer above, I've been waiting a long time for this video. And it's every bit as good as I remember it being.  The sets, costumes and, of course, actors are all superb (especially Phillipe Leroy as Leonardo).  I also always enjoyed the Rod Serling-like commentator who occasionally invades the scene, giving background details or insights into Leonardo's thoughts and personality. A must for any Leo-lover!",981331200,5,418,5.223880597014926
637483,5,6303400396,"This video set provides a lot of historical perspective on the strange life of Leonardo da Vinci who was without question one of the weirdest people who ever lived.

It's difficult to really compare him to anyone else such as other people who are generally considered geniuses today.  He seemed to be someone who was good at many things but only wanted to do things that he was interested in and he often left things unfinished.

What was unique about da Vinci was the combination of artistic and scientific interests.  He seemed to have basically unlimited energy and curiousity.

Leonardo was in some ways very fortunate because he was held in the very highest esteem by some rich people.  The king of France treated him almost like royality.  Here's a guy who would think nothing of sending thousands of soldiers into a human meat grinder but yet he felt that Leonardo was one of the greatest men that ever lived.

Leonardo was treated very well by the standards of the day and he always seemed to have money.  A lot of these guys he worked for were killers including the guy he put on all those pagents for.  That was also the guy who's young ambitious wife died as fate eventually always returns sadness to the cruel and greedy.

Leonardo had his hard times also and really never had a home until old age.  I think he had a hard time fitting his intense interests into the primitive social structure of the times.

Were he alive today da Vinci would most likely be a surgeon or scientist or at least he would try to become these things.

Leonardo came close to being burned at the stake for something he would say and get involved in some 500 years in the future.  Something that exists outside of time.

But fortunately he is remembered for his great spiritual paitings, especially The Last Supper which miraculously has somehow survived after beginning to deteriorate soon after it was finished due to using the wrong types of paiting methods.

He tried to create a gigantic oil painting on a wall and he treated the wall like a gigantic canvas.

637484,5,6303400396,"Originally telecast by PBS stations in 1972 as ""I, Leonardo"" this five-part series earned a Golden Globe award for Best TV Drama in 1973. I loved it then and was thrilled to be able to finally see it again  after so many years.  The program is simply outstanding, stunning, superb,  bellissima . . . I've run out of superlatives to describe it.  A vividly  illustrative, highly-detailed, historically accurate,  only-occasionally-sentimental account of the life of an incredible human  being, the program provides a great deal of information about all facets of  Leonardo's life and the personal, political, and artistic challenges that  confronted him.  I enjoyed the detailed background provided about his  mother Caterina,about whom very little is known, and the balanced handling  of his relatonships with the two primary disciples in his life, Salai and  Francisco Melzi. The video also provides a wealth of information about the  historical events that forced him to leave and return to Florence and  Milan, the political intrigue of the leaders he had to collaborate with,  and the bitter rivalry between him and Michaelangelo in his later years.  It's a show I can and will watch over and over and over again . . . and  again.",951955200,49,1234,5.054726368159204

637599,1,6303400396,"The one star is for this DVD (as well as Questar's previous two disc DVD release with a different cover) - and NOT the actual show.  The original series which aired on CBS in 1972 is nothing short of a masterpiece!  It's viewing time is four and a half hours.  Don't be fooled by the running time stated on the DVD which is also four and a half hours.  What Questar did was chop out huge parts of the original series and made up the lost time with five inept extras in order to fool the unwary buyer.

If you want to see the entire THE LIFE OF LEONARDO DA VINCI, thankfully the series is still available on VHS.

So much has been butchered in the DVD release that I would strongly urge anyone looking to see this fantastic production to buy the VHS version instead.  Why on earth Questar - who are behind the handsomely boxed and complete VHS version - would cut out such huge and vital chunks of the original production is absolutely bizarre.  But whatever the reason, the DVD is an atrocity.  I made the mistake of buying it, delighted that the VHS tapes were now on DVD!  When I finally watched the DVD I sat stunned at how much was missing - and I was so glad I still had the original series on video.

I hope this helps!",1358208000,9,1225,4.1923076923076925

The production is lush and filled with beautiful locations.  I'm not a Leonardo scholar, so I can't vouch for the biographical details, but this series paints a vivid image of the ultimate Renaissance Man.

With the chance to correct that failure with this new DVD release and restore the lost value, Questar has once again cheated viewers and disrespected the artists who created this series, adding supplementary shorts, but leaving the main documentary in its still badly mangled form.

By all means, get the VHS version and view it first, which I thankfully already own, if you want to see what these filmmakers really did, rather than settling for the this hatchet job Questar has shamelessly, repeatedly marketed to DVD shoppers. A disgrace.",1350518400,6,866,5.098591549295775

637657,5,6303400396,"While this series isn't for everyone, I devoured it with enthusiasm because of the way it so beautifully brought to life the imagery of the Renaissance, and the personal and artistic struggles of Leonardo. While the dramatization was bit stiff, corny and awkward, the art direction was just stupendous. Gorgeous costumes, cityscapes, and scenes of the countryside. And while long, the screenplay did include much wonderful material on Leaonardo's creative process. In the end, his was a rather sad and frustrating life, always at the mercy of political turmoil and the whims of powerful patrons. While he was revered and respected in his lifetime, he was also persecuted and often misunderstood. This series does a very respectable job of capturing such a poignant and brilliant life story.",1298764800,,790,5.228346456692913
637658,5,6303400396,"In my late teens I had the opportunity to see this magnificent documentary on TV. It left me an unforgettable impression. Recently my son needed to do a project on Leonardo and I remembered this italian production. I was extremely surprised and happy to find it in Amazon. Our entire family watched it together experiencing the sensation of having traveled to the intimacy of Leonardo's life and times. Italian director-writer Renato Castellani has artistically recreated with masterful poetry, beauty and thorough documentation every transcendental detail in Da Vinci's complex life and legend. Actor Philippe Leroy superbly lives his character with outmost conviction. Its extraordinary chapters help you to understand better the man, his brilliant mind and his times. The documentary leaves you with the strange feeling of having met Leonardo personally and yet it keeps a subtle mysterious veil which invites you to revisit this documentary over and over again. A must have for anyone who already admires the great master or would like to discover Leonardo Da Vinci and especially for all those who would like to posses a work of art!",1234915200,,1138,5.224043715846994

637661,5,6303400396,"I first saw this drama-documentary more than 30 years ago on Armed Forces Television in Germany.  I have been looking for it on tape or, recently DVD ever since.

The film was made in Italy, I believe, and done very well.  Leonardo da Vinci is shown through all the stages of his life, as a young boy, through his apprenticeship, and subsequent career as artist, designer, engineer, and advisor.

Ever the curious, observant perfectionist, da Vinci  watches the world and wonders why it works as it does.  His efforts to make machines that fly, machines that are invulnerable to gunfire, walls that are impregnable, and art that sets new standards in the world, changed the way the world saw itself.

Da Vinci remains, to this day, an enigmatic figure, misunderstood and aloof from the society he worked to improve.

This is an excellent documentary for schools and families alike.  I highly recommend ""The Life of Leonardo da Vinci.""",1178668800,3,934,4.860759493670886

I originally intended to buy this series on DVD, but when I read on Amazon that some of the original film had been omitted on the DVD version, I decided to go with the VHS version (if it's unavailable here, try ebay). I cannot imagine this series being nearly as enjoyable or informative without the narrator. Thanks to the other reviewers for their advice!",1147132800,13,407,4.589041095890411
637663,5,6303400396,"My wife told me about having seen this series about Leonardo Da Vinci when she was a child.  It had stuck with her for over 30 years, and she dearly wanted to see it again.  After doing some research on The Internet Movie Database, we determined this was the series she had seen.  At first, I ordered the DVD edition.  Then, I read the reviews.  (I know.  I did this in the wrong order.)  When I read that the narrator had been cut out of the DVD version, I asked my wife about it.  She told me that the narrator was one of the best elements of the series!  I immediately cancelled the previous order, and ordered the VHS edition instead.  Boy, am I glad!  I can't imagine this series being anywhere near as good without the character of the narrator who walks through the scenes and interacts with some of the historical characters.  The narrator is a charming, creative, and essential element of this series.  Cutting the character out of the DVD edition was sheer idiocy!",1136073600,33,974,4.435028248587571
637742,2,6303400396,"I would normally write a much longer review of this DVD, given the subject matter, AND would have given it 5 Stars. But, considering that this release by Questar is pointlessly a cut up, BASTARDIZED version of the original mini-series (which can still be had in its entirety on VHS, also from Questar), I am forced to focus more on what's wrong with this particular release, rather than extoll the astonishing merits of the wonderful film. Please avoid this version at all costs, and if you can, get the full version on VHS. Questar has cut out some of the best moments of this film series for no valid reason I can discern - maybe just to save 2 bucks on the overall package price. They have done great damage to this film, by removing, amongst other key scenes, the important in-story narrator. This element added much charm and charisma to an already fasicinating film - and was one of the many reasons it is, in its original form, so enchanting. Removing the in-story narrator also necessitated removing some key speculations concerning important areas of Leonardo's life and thought. I, personally, am glad I still have my VHS copy, and would like to submit a separate review on that one. This one, you can skip.",1133049600,42,1217,4.665116279069768
637743,5,6303400396,"This 1972 series is an excellent drama based on the Italian Renaissance man Leonardo da Vinci's life, with many of his inventions and paintings profiled and explained in detail.  The camera work is excellent, and the locations where this was filmed - I presume in northern Italy - create an authentic atmosphere.  Costumes, props, and acting are all first rate.  This was originally a co-production between a Chicago TV company and one in Milan, Italy, and the actors are Italian, but there are English overdubs, which are sometimes noticeable, but not distracting, at least not so to me.

Philippe Leroy, an actor I've never encountered before, plays Leonardo da Vinci as an adult.  He shows the serious, at times almost dour side of Leonardo the genius, constantly involved in an invention or painting.  Leonardo has a huge burden for the inventions he creates, and terrific commitment to the princes and dukes he serves.  One wonders in our more egalitarian age if the royalty Leonardo worked for felt a similar sense of commitment to him.

The narrator interjects different theories about Leonardo's life and inventions, attempting to dispel some myths which arose over the 5 centuries since Leonardo's time (he died in 1519, in the service of the French King Frances, considered an enemy by many of the Italian princes, and Leonardo was a native Italian.)  One such myth is that Leonardo, considered a ""King"" in a sense because of his genius, died in the arms of the King of France, since proven to be more legend than real event.

I bought this VHS series in 1990, and have enjoyed it from time to time ever since.  Picture, color and sound quality are all very good.  Highly recommended for students of history, Renaissance painting, or anyone who likes biographies of great men of history, of which Leonardo was an excellent example: serving humanity with his genius.",1132099200,5,1875,4.917460317460318
637744,5,6303400396,"Because of this movie, I launched into a research project to learn everything I could learn about Da Vinci.  It was THAT inspirational for me.  I didn't learn much more through books and websites than I did through this movie, so that should tell you how educational this DVD set really is.  Yet, don't let the word ""educational"" make you think it was dry & sleep-inducing.  It was an entertaining watch, too.  We enjoy documentaries and biographies, though.  Still, if you want to learn about Da Vinci, this is the best film to get, hands down.",1131753600,2,545,4.625
637745,4,6303400396,"Leonardo was not appreciated in his own time. He was sidelined, persecuted and many of his works destroyed. A similar fate has befell this documentary. I saw this film in the 70s. It was shown on Australian TV (where I live) and I thought it then, and probably still do, the greatest TV film I have ever seen. Leonardo, I believe, excelled his contemporaries in the range of his discoveries, and I believe he excells our contemporaries in the same way: this is a man whom to see as a precursor of 20th century science is to belittle. Castellani's film now exists in three versions. To save other viewers the trouble of the research, following is what I have found out about each version.

""The Life of Leonardo da Vinci"" was a 1971 Italian TV production directed by Renato Castellani, a famous and critically esteemed director of the time. It tapped into a moment of patriotic fervour in Italy and was funded by the Italian government to an unprecedented extent, becoming the most expensive production made in Italy up to that time. It was produced in the same way that Hollywood epics are fabled to be, with on location shoots at every place Leonardo was known to have lived or visited, and with a 'cast of thousands'. Meticulous care was taken with costumes and sets, without exception both luxurious and authentic. Particular care was also taken with casting. An innovative and appropriately experimental approach (for the time) saw the casting of a famous TV personality, Giulio Bosetti, as a modern dress narrator, strolling onto the historical sets to give a modern day perspective of the events depicted.

The original Italian version is available on a 3 DVD set. It has an Italian soundtrack and Italian subtitles, but no English, I presume to avoid competing with versions released in English speaking countries. If you understand Italian, this is the preferred version. It runs at the original broadcast time of 320 minutes.

The English language distribution rights for the film were secured by Questar Inc of Chicago, a specialist distributor of historical and other documentary material. Questar released a version on VHS videotape which dropped the Italian soundtrack for a (very well) dubbed English one. This version is still available for those not adverse to videotape. It is on a set of 3 videocassettes and runs for 270 minutes.

Questar Inc also released a DVD version of the film. This version has been shortened and is on 2 DVDs. Removed is all the material featuring Giulio Bosetti as the modern dress narrator, which would have also meant shortening some of the scenes on which he makes a commentary. Presumably the editors thought viewers would be puzzled by the sight of a modern narrator stepping out from an historical set (forget the contribution of structuralist film critics and the impact of Jean-Luc Goddard on cinema - this is supposed to be an historical epic, right?). The film survives this blundering butchery, it's that good. The dubbed soundtrack is slightly out of synch though. Somewhat unforgivably, Questar lifted the film specs from their video release and describe it as running at 270 minutes. There is no mention of any cuts. As a compensation, 5 short documentaries of 5-10 minutes each are included on the second disk. The film's running time is 230 minutes (total time including extras is back to 270 minutes).

This is the only version English speakers who prefer disk format can see Castellani's film. Even Japanese viewers have to watch this version (with Japanese subtitles). I think people who care about film, about Leonardo, who object to false advertising and concealed censorship, should object, but doubtless I'm in the minority.

Worth looking for is a 2004 BBC documentary, ""Leonardo da Vinci"", a 3 episode, 160 minute film which features spectacular photography, reconstructions and testing of some of Leonardo's machines (and some insights about them never before appreciated), location shoots, dramatic re-enactments, readings from the Notebooks and commentary by scholars. While not as good as Castellani's original film, it is better than the truncated version.",1130025600,11,4130,5.039531478770132
637746,5,6303400396,"It's unfortunate that the first thing many people would think of today at the mention of Da Vinci's name is the fictitious Da Vinci code rather than, say, the Mona Lisa.  I think this presentation's subtitle is absolutely correct when it names Da Vinci ""the most brilliant mind in history.""  Artist, scientist, architect, military designer - he was all of these and more.  The Life of Leonardo Da Vinci covers the Maestro's complete life over the course of four and a half hours and then throws in five impressive bonus features on top of that.  Philippe Leroy gives an impeccable performance in the starring role, backed up by a cast of hundreds against a backdrop of more than 90 locations in Italy.  Produced in 1972, the production looks its age, but it also shows the care and respect with which it was filmed.

We really don't know all that much about much of Da Vinci's life.  It sounds a little funny when the film points this out and then goes on to dramatize it all, anyway.  Clearly, though, what was put on film here was the result of meticulous research.  Of course, probably the greatest treasure trove of history is the remaining collection of Da Vinci's notes, which provide early sketches of some lost works, a record of Da Vinci's incredible inventions, and a record of his anatomical studies of the human body.  Truly he was a man hundreds of years ahead of his time, coming up with the original ideas for the tank, an underwater breathing apparatus, the helicopter, the parachute, the machine gun, etc.  Tragically, many of his notes and sketches were lost to history, as were some of his artistic creations.  Many might be surprised to learn that we have only eleven completed pieces of Da Vinci artwork today.  This film takes you through the creation of all of those masterpieces - plus some that have been lost or were never finished.

Da Vinci was a truly fascinating man, and this film does an excellent job communicating his isolation from the rest of the world.  He was an illegitimate child who never really had a home of his own.  In his prime, he sojourned between his native Florence and Milan, forced to flee on several occasions when the constantly shifting tides of military power among the Italian city states shifted or when France invaded.  In his later years, he was forced to suffer the abuse of the hot-tempered upstart Michelangelo, before finally finding some sanctuary in France in his last days.

I think the film does quite a fair job of dramatizing Da Vinci's life.  Many biographical treatments resort to sensational charges concerning the mysterious legal troubles that fueled his original exit from Florence and indulge in unfounded speculations of homosexuality.  Everything here is based as accurately as possible on what history tells us.  Da Vinci's biggest problem was that he was really too brilliant.  Forever fascinated with nature, he found himself distracted all too often from other work he was doing, and his meticulous methods required great patience on the part of his clients.  He could go days without touching a brush, yet he was working all the same - unlike any other artist, Da Vinci's art pieces were ""written"" as well as painted.  He studied every facet of horses and how they moved, for example, before attempting to make a bronze horse sculpture.

Da Vinci was not only the most brilliant mind in history, he was also probably history's most brilliant failure.  Besides the number of commissioned works he never completed, some of his works were plagued with problems: his Battle of Anghiari mural was ruined as the result of a failed experiment with drying the oil-based paint, for example.  Even his marvelous fresco of The Last Supper began suffering cracks shortly after its completion.  Seeing both his successes and his failures recreated on the screen, one gets a much deeper appreciation of the man and his humanity.  It's not really a happy story, as Da Vinci suffered many wrongs in his life and was never really given the respect he deserved (even his grave was desecrated and his bones hurled into a mass burial pit by foreign invaders several years after his death).

Besides the feature film, the DVD also includes five short bonus features: The Rise of Renaissance Italy, Leonardo's Masterpieces, Da Vinci's Inventions, The Maestro vs. Michelangelo, and The Works of Two Great Masters: A Timeline.  The whole presentation brings Da Vinci to life in as realistic a way as possible, and that makes The Life of Leonardo Da Vinci a masterpiece of sorts in and of itself.",1124496000,,4555,4.831185567010309
637747,5,6303400396,"The acting and narrative bring this story to life... BEAUTIFUL women and HANDSOME men... great costumes and settings... great actors for Leonardo as boy, young man, and adult. Wonderful reconstructions of the art and inventions.

What I didn't expect, and loved, was the reflection in the narrative about THINKING of things versus ACHIEVING things. Leonardo was much less productive than his contemporary Michelangelo, yet is regarded as the better painter and finer mind. Why? Many of Leonardo's inventions (parachute, helicopter, submarine, tank) were never realized but instead reinvented centuries later, yet he is given credit for them. Why?

In the end I find this production inspiring for its actors, settings, reconstructions, narrative, and thoughtfulness. I highly recommend it.

Note, it was produced in Italy and has a quirky sound quality not unlike watching ""A Fistful of Dollars."" A surprise for the first few minutes but not an issue after that.",1119830400,2,961,5.3933333333333335
637748,2,6303400396,"When The Life of Leonard DaVinci first aired on American Television, I believe it was on ABC, my wife and I had only been married a few months. But, every Sunday night as I recall, for about four or five weeks, we watched this fantastic production.

Years later, we saw it again on PBS. When I began teaching, I found that our local educational resource center had this program on VHS. As a graphic arts teacher, I felt that Leonardo and this documentary were of such great importance, I would show a chapter or two to my students during the course of a term. And, I would take it home at watch it again and again.

Not only was Leonardo, as one of the Amazon reviewers describes, a bit weird, he was also brilliant and interesting. Brilliant and interesting also describes this entire Italian production. As much as I dislike foreign films with the out-of-sync English dubbed voices, I was able to over look it in this extremely informative and superbly produced film. I really liked the occasional interaction of the characters as they sort of stumble into the narrator; I thought that to be very clever and nicely executed. So, after seeing that it was available in DVD, I purchased a copy.

I am so disappointed... What inept producer, or editor, of re-release material thought that he or she had the requisite skills to chop up so much of this production? I was so angered by this that I'm sorry I bought the DVD. The complete version deserves a FIVE STAR +, the DVD... TWO, if that much! This great program, unfortunately placed in the hands of a flaming IDIOT, ruined the overall presence and personality of this presentation by IGNORANTLY cutting away some wonderful clips that brought such a meaningful and complete story to an eager audience.

I really love the quality of DVD, but for this, I'll just go check out the VHS version and watch it from time to time. Oh, just an afterthought... Is there a COMPLETE version of this available on DVD? Hey, you, bonzo with the editing shears... Do you still have the original? Well, how about releasing that for some of us - ""I-want-to-see-the-whole THING"" fanatics!

637749,4,6303400396,"This 1970's docudrama has the video texture that came out in the 70's. One can almost instantly feel the graininess even when the film presentation is of a higher quality, which this one is. Our image was very good but doesn't have that pristine silken feeling one finds today or in many films that date back to the 1940's.

The sets and costume designs are authentic and a visual treat. The subject matter is more visual and entertaining than thought provoking. The film treads on the 'safe' side of da Vinci's life. But when a man has such complexity and genius, even that is enough. We never found ourselves board or wanting to take a break. It is entertaining enough to watch in one sitting, of course with the usual breaks.

Everything da Vinci like everything Shakespeare or Beethoven or Mahler should be viewed. When historical figures are presented to the Modern audience, some of the spaces will have to be filled in with educated probabilities and possibilities. This is very much the case with da Vinci. Much of his life is unknown. I think the producers of this film did a credible job in fleshing out da Vinci's life. I would have liked more in-depth footage on his intellectual and sexual life, even if only speculation, as long it is credible and relevant to what made this great man tick and bleed and exceed.

I highly recommend this to all lovers of da Vinci and those who simply want to learn and open their minds. One word of caution though. On disc 2, episode 4, there is a slight glitch. The disc freezes and has to be manipulated to fast forward. It's a minor problem. It is a manufacturing problem, as it was on both our original and replacement copy, in the exact same place. I, however, would not let this minor glitch stop me from purchasing and enjoying this dvd.",1097971200,22,1791,4.555900621118012
637750,5,6303400396,"Made in Italy in 1972, with superb acting from Philippe Leroy and supporting cast. What is most fascinating, however, are the reconstructions of Leonardo's many artistic and mechanical masterpieces, some of which have been lost. The costumes, the sets and camera are all flawless. One of the best documentaries of all time.",1085875200,13,323,5.230769230769231
637751,1,6303400396,"After reading The DaVinci Code, I wanted to watch a biography about DaVinci, so I purchased this movie.  It was made sometime in the 1970's and the screen quality (even on DVD) is horrible.  What's worse is the awful overdub.  At the beginning of the movie an announcer explains that there is not a lot of information on the childhood of Leonardo DaVinci, but this is what could have happened...and they create little childhood for DaVinci.  I thought this would have had biographers and mini dramatizations on DaVinci's life...not a full movie recreating his life.",1084752000,9,565,4.91578947368421
7845248,5,6303400396,"The VHS version is only way to view this 5 part series as the DVD version has been butchered beyond belief. You will get the narrator and all of the great music by Roman Vlad.  I just watched my VHS copy, which I purchased about thirty years ago. It comes in a beautiful 3 tape box with Leonardo artwork on each side, though Questar's offering of it today is probably cheap junk, recorded in the LP mode to save money on tape, if their treatment of the DVD is any indication. Buy the best used one you can find! To set some of the reviewers straight, this was made in 1971, but never shown in this country until August & September of 1972. It was on CBS on Sunday nights for 5 weeks and sponsored by IBM. The first episode was 90 minutes with an hour for the remaining four parts. And this agrees to the VHS lengths; Part one is 70 minutes with the remaining parts two thru five at 50 minutes each for a total of 270 minutes.",1513814400,,925,4.138888888888889

I waited a long time for the series to come out on DVD. It has been over 46 years for me, yet the music is just as I remembered it.
A great series, but as I remember it, I think there were about 5 or 6 episodes. This means that the DVD set is edited down, somewhat.

Still, I'm glad that it's out now, at long last.",1506643200,,379,3.7848101265822787
