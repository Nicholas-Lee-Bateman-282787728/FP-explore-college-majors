5732810,5,B00CPN933K,"My son is almost 3 and he is obsessed with these Mike the Knight shows.  I have already bought 2 of the DVD's.  He puts on his knight in shining armor and goes around the house all day saying ""Be a knight and do it right!""  All of the episodes seem to have the same underlying message that Mike is being selfish or fighting with his sister and then he realizes he is not being good and says ""It's time to be a knight and do it right!""  Then he fixes the problem and is a good role model for kids.",1391472000,3,496,3.881188118811881

5732813,4,B00CPN933K,"My son fell in love with Mike the Knight the first time he saw it so I knew he'd be thrilled to receive Magical Mishaps, the latest from his favorite hero.

I like that the show stars Mike and his sister Evie since I have a boy and a girl because they like to pretend they are their favorite characters and act out some of the shows. Since the show encourages working together at solving problems, I appreciate the lessons that my kids take away from it and then act out on their own.

My son was a little disappointed that the six episodes included he had already seen on Nick Jr. Personally I was happy to have them on a disc I can pop in instead of trying to remember to record it for him! Plus it's nice to have when we go camping and don't have cable or on a long trip in the car. Episodes include:
The Polka Dot Horse
Sir Super
The Many Knights
The Mission Mess
The Glendragon News
The Real Sword

At just an hour long, Magical Mishaps is the perfect length to hold my kids attention. Your kids will grow to love these magical characters who perform heroic acts but are still human enough to make mistakes.",1378166400,4,1112,4.186915887850467
