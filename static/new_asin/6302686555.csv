This movie was a fun and educational part of my childhood, and I'm looking forward to sharing it with my kids. The songs are classic, the illustrations are vintage Sendak (and unlike so many ""animated"" versions of children's books, they are ANIMATED, not just camera shots of stills). I can't tell you how much I love this movie.",1128988800,3,336,4.694915254237288
496992,5,6302686555,"Growing up listening to Carole King probably did it for me, but this is one of my all-time favorite movies & cd's!!!  In fact,  as a teacher, I did this play with my primary class and they adored the songs and the story...even the boys!  I'd hear them singing in unison at ""snack time.""  My little one is also beginning to appreciate the wondeful ways of Carole King & Maurice Sendak! This is a DEFINITE must-have for anyone who loves music and classic stories!",1121472000,2,461,4.4523809523809526
496993,5,6302686555,"Back in the '70's when I was a youngster I enjoyed this television special on PBS.  Now as a parent I couldn't wait to get my hands on a copy of this video.  My child loves the songs, (I also purchased the Really Rosie Soundtrack and it's wonderful) and we watch the endearing animated story over and over again together.  The story is set on a front stoop in Brooklyn where Rosie is the Queen of her block and all her little friends and playmates gather around to put on a ""show"" complete with fantasy songs and make believe stories.  The entire program is filled with catchy tunes and a wonderfully told story.  This is one for your youngster's favorite video collection.  It is very hard to find but I snagged a used copy from Amazon Marketplace so don't hesitate to order if it's still available.  Enjoy!",1049587200,26,808,4.45578231292517
496994,5,6302686555,"REALLY ROSIE is something that I bought for my son, when it first appeared on television. Now, I have bought this marvelous piece of work, sung by the fantastic voice of Carole King, for his son. The songs have become part of our family, from ""Chicken Soup"", to ""Really Rosie"" to ""One Was Johnny"". We love them all,as we watch the fantastic characters,singing along with them. This is just wonderful for children. There aren't many things finer than this production. It is a classic. Carole King was the perfect voice that was chosen for this role. REALLY ROSIE really should be done on Broadway. First it was television for us,then we bought the record,and now the video. We love it.",1034467200,20,684,4.708333333333333
496995,5,6302686555,"""Believe me"", this is one of the most magical performances
you will find for children.  Carole King makes Maurice
Sendak's characters come to life(as if he needs any help)
with the most wonderful music and a beautiful voice.
Your children will enjoy learning the alphabet,numbers,seasons,
manners and how much fun using their imaginations can be-Why,
even ""Pierre"" would ""Care"" to have a video,CD or Book of Really
Rosie!!!",1021075200,7,423,5.220588235294118
496996,5,6302686555,"I would love to see this released as a DVD. This is one of the best movies I have seen and am lucky that the library has a copy so that I can share it with my daughter. We have the soundtrack and a lot of the books that go along with it. Carole King makes the movie just wonderful.
Chicken Soup With Rice will live in my heart forever...",1004659200,5,337,3.8285714285714287
496997,5,6302686555,"This was Carole King's debut in film, and was her only take in film. Although most critics would disagree, This is one of the best films of all-time. I really wish carole would star in another film, but I'm sure she won't. This film was originally aired on television in 1975. I remember watching it the night that it premiered on TV. When it was over, me and the guys hopped in the station wagon with the soundtrack, which was on 8-track tape, and listened to it on the way to the discoteque. We were 17 at the time and we loved it. I still love it, and watch the laserdisc all the time. I know you will love it too. All Carole King fans should purchase this film, fore it is essential to any Carole King collection.",998265600,3,717,4.202898550724638

7829698,5,6302686555,"Nothing more to be said.  Love Carole King.  Love Maurice Sendak.  It's the reason by daughter started to sing, and she hasn't stopped yet!",1262131200,,139,4.708333333333333

7829700,5,6302686555,"First of all--Carol King: brilliant. She did an incredible job of this music. Secondly--all of the songs were fantastic, we all enjoyed them. Especially my older son. When he was around five years old, he kept playing this over and over and over while we were driving for 10 hours. We told him to shut it off, we had heard it enough. But he kept going back to it. Third--as we know, the ""Rosie"" song is not available for release, but you can buy a DVD with the other ""Nutshell"" songs on it, plus ""Where the Wild Things Are"", and ""In the Night Kitchen"". It's available for only $8.99 from Amazon (prime); I already bought four copies of it. It rocks!",1257465600,,649,4.371900826446281

7829702,5,6302686555,"Rosie is the ultimate star- five is not nearly enough.  The only thing I can complain about is that I have always, since I was little, wished this TV special was longer.  There are more songs on the album, which I think came first.  You can't lose with this- if you can find it!",1192665600,,278,4.111111111111111

7829704,5,6302686555,"I have been looking for this video for the longest! I have great memories of seeing the film and and singing the songs in elementary school, and still remember parts of ""Pierre"" and ""Chicken Soup with Rice."" I don't know what it is about Carole King's voice, but it has resonated in my memory for over 20 years.

I recently asked Weston Woods, the distributor of the VHS, about the possibility of releasing the film on DVD. They responded:

""The rights to REALLY ROSIE have been [held] up for close to ten years now due to legal reasons.  The original parties involved in producing the film are in the midst of working this out, and we're hopeful that we'll be able to re-release the film on DVD in the not-too-distant future.  If we do, we'll be re-mastering it from an original 35mm print.""

I hope they are able to work it out too! I want to make sure my nieces and cousins have influence from great children's visual and musical art-- particularly the non-Disney variety!!",1174262400,8,976,4.554285714285714
