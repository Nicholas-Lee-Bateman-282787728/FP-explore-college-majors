7905382,2,B000009DXX,"Wow, two hundred bucks for a VHS tape of a substandard assembly line chopsocky presented in pan and scan? Actually, that's not entirely correct. There are some elements that make this film unique among its genre contemporaries but none of them have to do with quality or value. One is its featured martial art of karate. Most Chinese films, for obvious reasons, concern themselves with some style of kung fu. The other is the presence of kung fu supervillain performer Hwang Jang Lee near the end. The fights, even those w/o HJL, are interesting to watch just to see how karate is presented differently than kung fu during this era, but the dramatuc scenes are boring as snail sex. The fights are probably on youtube anyway.",1522195200,,724,4.753968253968254
