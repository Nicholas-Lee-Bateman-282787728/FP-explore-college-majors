8202357,5,B000RQ6HPY,I'm a dance teacher and love to stay educated through instructional dance dvds. I purchased this dvd and loved his choreography and instruction. He was very good at breaking down the movements and it felt very natural and comfortable to watch and learn. I highly recommend for Contemporary Jazz or Modern!  I used some of his movements for my modern dance and worked great!!!,1381104000,,375,4.859375
