4246390,5,B0041UUNU2,"This 3 DVD set covers pilates from many levels.

The first DVD is Pilates For Inflexible People, and if you are a beginner or need more help starting with pilates, this is broken down to make the moves easier then adds some more.

The Pilates For Weight Loss has three levels of pilates.  The beginning level also is modified to help those that need it and then increases through the levels.

The last, Pilates Sculpt and Tone is good when you start getting the hang of pilates down and provides a good workout.

I have been using the Inflexible People one to get started and mixing it in with the weight loss beginning section for the most part, though I have tried the sculpt and tone for fun.  Looking forward to progressing more and getting into shape so that the higher levels of the weight loss (there are 3 levels) and the sculpt and tone are the ones I can do more, though I can see myself going back to the easier material from time-to-time for refresher or days that I may want to take it a bit easier.",1289952000,194,1012,4.328042328042328
4246391,2,B0041UUNU2,"Bought at Target. DVD's are poor quality. The sound doesn't always match the video and the instructors seem rigid and nervous, lacking energy and warmth. Packaging leaves packaging to be desired. The discs are stacked one right on top of another. These feel more like budget productions than motivating classes. The one thing it does do well is the sheer volume of content on these discs. There are adaptations for every move and routine, using ball, hand weights. But I can probably use my large stability ball to adapt any Pilates DVD. I personally prefer videos from Gaiam or Element.",1499299200,,587,4.88

4246417,5,B0041UUNU2,"Excellent purchase. I decided to buy after a male shopper said he had purchased several exercise DVD's and this was one of the better ones by comparison. I had quit my gym 1.5 years ago because I wanted to exercise outdoors. I have been taking very very long walks during this time but I wanted something a bit more than just walks now. I had considered Zumba but I thought it would be too intense for me. The DVD's arrived today and I did 1h of exercises. I took the first CD out (Pilates for inflexible people) and the exercises were very nice split through a 2 level menu. The CD has an intro of explanation of what it contains. I did fist 25 min of exercise (a 10 min lesson followed by a 15 min lesson). Everything was in my comfort zone, no weird position or move that I could not hold. It repeats everthing in sets of 4s' but by the 4th set I did feel strain. Not to worry the next exercise was using a different group of muscles. By alternating the exercises this way I could work out for 25 min without a break and at the end I did not feel very tired. I took 2 h of break at the computer and when I stood up I could feel all my muscles mildly sore. So the workout had effect, it had seemed easy but it did work my body out too. I then completed another 30 min of exercise and again I feel mildly tired. The step of the exercises is relatively slow with focus on *holding* the poses rather than pumping muscles. At the end of the exercise there are 2 more menu items : the same exercise slowed down or sped up as each individual would need.

I intend to use the first DVD for 1-2 months and then graduate to the next 2 DVDs. I will update my review later with further feedback.",1463011200,,1686,4.078313253012048

4246438,5,B0041UUNU2,"For me to get out of bed in the morning 30 minutes before I normally do just to do the 30 minute Pilates is nothing short of a miracle. For me to be slightly bummed that I need to wait another few days before doing this DVD again is flabbergasting. I'm the laziest person I know. I don't exercise, I don't go to the gym, I don't walk the less-than-a-mile distance to work. I don't even walk 2 blocks to the restaurant up the street.

I love the Pilates Sculpt & Tone DVD.

Meghan is very thorough, very detailed and reminds you of things you forget while you're doing certain things. ""Don't forget to breathe."" ""Make sure your leg is this way, not that"" ""If this is too hard, do it this way."" I did the 15 minute routine first and it was a great introduction as to what to expect. This morning I did the 30 minute mat and I can feel it in my body, my muscles. Not a lot but enough so that it's encouraging and motivating to do it again. And the stretching at the end!! My favorite part!!

So, after only 2 ""sessions,"" 45 minutes on the Pilates Sculpt and Tone DVD, I'm hooked. I look forward to the Inflexible People DVD. I'm excited for the changes my body goes through in the next few weeks. It's my hope that by the new year, I'll be in really great shape, have toned muscles, have great strength and a lot of flexibility.

I would definitely recommend.",1445299200,20,1356,4.203846153846154

Had I liked those, I might have done the inflexible one even though that is not an issue for me.  The segments are obviously very old judging by the production value.  You can customize the workouts but only if you have all of the accessories.  If you don't have a ball or a ring or weights, you're going to be limited to what you can choose from.  Also, the segments are very disjointed.  Within one 30 minute workout there could be four or five fade to black moments where the workout changes (like from arms to legs and from legs to abs).

The only drawback is that it doesn't give you pointers on form, so unless you already know how to do Pilates right, you could really get it wrong if you only watched this DVD.  I have used the Windsor Pilates DVDs and those give great tips on form but the videos are SUPER slow--maybe almost too much instruction--and not enough challenging variety.

Lesson learned, if it's a company you've never heard about they probably buy discs for wholesale and could care less as to whether they will work for the consumer

The exercises are slow enough for the most part, but she does have you moving from one to the other sometimes faster than your body wants to move.

By the time I started the Pilates Sculpt and Tone, I was already more flexible and seeing ""cuts"" in my muscles.

They give you ""instructions"" in the beginning but not long enough.  Even though they explained ""powerhouse"" and I know what it is, after their explanation I would be confused.

The routines are entirely too fast.  You should be holding poses longer and not working by momentum.  I went through all of the DVDs and did not find a routine I would return to.

They don't emphasis breathing. One issue for many beginnings is getting the breathing right - when to exhale and inhale.  They don't do a good job for that.

I will say that at this point I've only been working with the Pilates for Inflexible People because I'm probably one of the most inflexible people. It is easy to follow and my body genuinely feels better after doing the basic Pilates on here as well as the Yoga for Flexibility.

A lot of the workouts are used in other CDs just repeating stuff, so when they say there's dozens of workouts, it's a lie. Also, Pilates is not explained at all! The way to approach Pilates, I have found, is to get a basic overview of what it is, how it works, breathing techniques, positions, etc. There is NONE of this. This is the biggest waste of time and money ever spent. Wish I could return it but it's more trouble than it's worth with Amazon to get $20 back.",1365984000,16,604,4.353982300884955

I didn't realize the tape is a succession of several workout scenerio dubbed together...it feel disjointed?  I don't care for how the transitions are made from one part of the body workout to the next.  In some instances,  you have to stop, and go to the next chapter to do the workouts.  I think this is a DVD set that would work fantastic for someone who has short spurts of time to work out; and can tackle your workout in a couple of 20 minute session,  it just wasn't the dvd for me.  However, you will love the workout...the instructors are fantastic and will teach you the basics of pilates and the proper breathing during the exercises.",1364774400,2,806,4.333333333333333

The instructor is just so dry, and she almost doesnt give you enough time to get into the postion and she is on to the next.

4246580,4,B0041UUNU2,"This DVD set is a re-release of three older DVDs.  For the price, you get a HUGE amount of variety.  However, the quality of the routines varies.  I have summarized each DVD below.

This DVD was released in 2005; the instructor is Maggie Rhoades, and she teaches via voiceover.  There are over 20 routines of varying lengths (e.g., 20 minutes, 30 minutes, or 1 hour).  However, the exercises may seem somewhat repetitive, and Rhoades moves quite slowly, even for beginners.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-Complete-for-Weight-Loss/dp/B0000VLKVW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates Complete for Weight Loss</a>
This DVD, released in 2004, features Karen Garcia, again teaching in voiceover.  Here there are different models displaying different levels of routines, either Beginning, Intermediate, or Advanced.  Again, the practices are various lengths (from about 15 to 45 minutes) and focus on various parts of the body.  There are also tutorials breaking down the moves.  This is probably my favorite DVD of the set.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pilates-Sculpt-and-Tone/dp/B000AXWHOY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pilates Sculpt and Tone</a>
This DVD with instructor Meaghan White is from 2005.  The most important thing to know about the routines here--again, there are over 20--is that they require a variety of equipment, including a Pilates ring, a stability ball, a small weighted ball, and dumbbells.  This is great if you are ready to add a little variety to your Pilates routine, but others may be disappointed if they don't own these items.  In addition to being categorized by equipment, the segments are also organized by being either under or over 15 minutes.  White instructs via voiceover, and there is a bit of a cheerleader feel about her.

Again, if you are looking for a wide variety of Pilates workouts, this is probably the best deal that you are going to find, but keep in mind that some of these routines might be hit or miss.",1361059200,4,2227,6.132258064516129

Seems to be more in the 90s and the woman is better and you can actually work out more at a better pace. The tone one is good too made more in the 90s as well she actually is talking and doing the exercises at the same time so more like being at a class.

4246604,3,B0041UUNU2,"I really enjoy Pilates and I got this thinking it would be a bit more challenging

Pros
-customizable workouts either by complexity, time you have, or by a specific part of body i.e legs arms, and by a specific Pilates too i.e ball, or weights
-As you watch you are being explained everything very thoroughly so you don't have to keep your eyes on the screen at all times
-I enjoy that there are three separate DVDs and each DVD has about 16 different workouts to meet your specific Pilates level
-there isn't a group of people working out with you on the screen it is one person so you don't have to focus on 50 people doing different variations etc

Cons
-I didn't read the entire description when I bought the DVD so I wasn't aware that you would need to own such accessories as a ball, circle weight and weights to fully use the scult and tone DVD but that is more my fault than the products
-I do not find myself as challenged as I would like to be so I find myself using it about 3 times a week and than switching to a more high intensity workout the remaining days.

Overall I would not recommend this for advanced Pilates users who want a hardcore workout this is for beginners",1355788800,5,1185,4.28125

4246624,2,B0041UUNU2,"This three DVD set varies quite a bit--it starts with very basic and ends with rather advanced workouts.

But the production quality is so-so at best.  The box makes it seems like this is a rather current production but the pictures are not of the actors or the sets on the DVD.  The pictures make this seem like a new production when in reality it was probably made in the early 90s.  I find it rather misleading.

The DVD for Inflexible People is taught by someone that is rather uncomfortable in front of a camera.  The setting is a rather dark hall (conference room?) with harsh lighting.  It definitely is not a gym and is rather awkward. I'd sooner expect a group of hunters to mount a trophy of their latest kill on the wall rather than an exercise class.  The routines are great for a newbie though.

The DVD for weight loss is set in the same dark hall with harsh lighting and it is with a voice over.  Voice overs always seems kinda weird because there are essentially two people there. The routines are good for a beginning to intermediate workout.

The third DVD is taught in a different setting and is more attractive and pleasing. Still, it seems to be from the early 90s.  The actor moves at a good clip and has some rather tough workouts.

So, overall the DVD content is good but the production quality is poor.",1353110400,2,1327,4.411522633744856

I have Pilates for Dummies, but this one knocks it out of the ball park!  It covers everything I needed plus Yoga, which I've never considered trying, so... we'll see how that goes.

4246638,2,B0041UUNU2,"I've been doing Pilates for more than a dozen years, and I've found it to be of great benefit, so I was pleased to see that I could pick up three discs for a comparatively low price. It turns out that they're cheap for a reason.

None of the discs are in widescreen format. The video itself is a low quality transfer from VHS. The set contains three DVDs jammed onto a single spindle in a single case, two of which have misspelled titles on them. I don't know if that means they're bootlegged, or the producers don't care if their product looks like it came from a back street market in Hong Kong. Let it suffice to say that it didn't make a good first impression.

Technical issues aside, here's a breakdown of the lesson content:

The ""Sculp"" (sic) DVD was adequate as long as you already know know how to modify routines to fit your own needs. Although there are roughly 20 workouts of 10-25 minutes on this DVD, most of them are just the same ""Fab Five"" routines done over and over again, except with different props. The sequencing is done correctly, but they are performed far too quickly and with twice as many repetitions as needed. If and when modifications are mentioned, it's always ""bend your legs"".

The ""Inflexib"" (sic) DVD is just a half baked jumble of Yoga and Yoga derived Pilates exercises you'll see in group mat classes at mass market gym chains. If you truly have flexibility problems, you'd be much better off using a DVD from someone who knows what they're doing, like Moira Stott or the Corp sisters, buying Alycea Ungaro's book, or taking a small class from a qualified instructor who's there to give you feedback on your form. This isn't a gentle introduction for people trying to rehab or recover from a period of forced inactivity, it's more of a ""throw a bunch of exercises at the wall, see what sticks, and hope we can cash in on a fad"" collection of unrelated postures.

The ""Weight Loss"" DVD provided is actually more of a ""Pilates for Beginners"" than a ""Weight Loss"" program. If you really want to lose weight, this isn't going to be of much help unless you've been exceptionally sedentary- if that's the case, you'd be much better off walking and  changing your diet. As for the beginning level instruction on the DVD, you'd be much less likely to injure yourself and gain some benefit if you try one of the previously mentioned alternatives. Like the other two DVDs, the exercises are performed too quickly and with too many repetitions. More importantly, the beginner DVD tends to focus on large limb movement, instead of focusing on breathing as a way to cue core stabilization. The end result is that beginners using this DVD will learn to flop their limbs around, but won't learn how to strengthen and increase their range of motion in  their hips, sacrum, shoulders, back, and neck.",1351468800,14,2823,4.600397614314115

I am a weight I like but I would like to see more tone and definition thats why I signed up for the kickboxing class. Pilates just wasn't for me although it increased my flexability I felt like I was in a yoga class and yoga isn't for me. I like long intense workouts with lots of cardio and I felt this wasn't it. The overall video was very informative and I felt it was typical for a pilates class although this is my first. I gave it a one because it wasn't for me and if you never have tried pilates before Id recommend going to an actual class than getting the video like I did.,1351382400,4,703,3.923076923076923

It's great for both body and mind.  I can feel the increased strength and toning in my core and arms already, and my flexibility has improved.  Many of my aches and pains have gone away.

The instructor knows what she's doing and has made this completely geared to the really inflexible people, which I am.  This isn't just going at a slower pace, she's modified the Pilates mat pieces so that anyone can do them and benefit.

Don't know if I missed it but I have to stress to any reader or curious lurker that this set of workouts provides many, many, many, hours of workouts, and a great diversity of them.  I'm happily astonished at the variety.  There are weighted workouts with dumbells, weighted ball, swiss ball, the ring,(as well as no weights) for toning and strengthening.  There are short workouts and long workouts, and workouts for those trying to lose weight (that are faster-paced).  Simply put, this is probably about $100 worth of workouts (at least), compared to other exercise videos/sets/kits.  In those bundled sets, you'll get 4 workouts and maybe a band for at least $40-$50.  I know, I have them!  For the beginner to the advanced, this is a *fantastic* purchase.  I'm so tickled I have so many workouts to choose from.  Glad that I already had weights and a swiss ball.  I purchased a 5 lb weighted ball to use and I'm loving that workout as well.

I actually did the Pilates for Inflexible People and this is the CD you should start with. Unlike the other Pilates DVDs I've bought, this one actually tells you exactly how to do the pose and why you are doing it. And its slow. Real Slow. Like for overweight people over 40. All the other DVDs I've purchased seemed to go way to fast with little or no explanation. I started with this one because I don't think I'm ready for Tone and Sculpt or the Weight Loss DVD.

Someone suggested this to me, after seeing my myriad of ""beginning yoga"" and ""Intro to Pilates"" DVD collections. Instead of buying and storing other DVDs, try this one first (even if you try it only as a warm up routine) and you'll save yourself a lot of money. This one makes you feel like you're doing Pilates and Yoga (the bane of my existence,,,uh because I'm inflexible).

There are also some general basic yoga bonus sections to work with.

Pilates for Weight Loss has beginning, intermediate and advanced levels.  If you are new, the second level of the first video and the beginners of this one can work.

The inflexible stuff is made for people who aren't rubber bands so it does move slower then some other pilates you might have done before.  I've mostly used the intermediate section of the weight loss program and really like it.  I find the pace to be good.

It's fast enough that I'm not bored and not so fast that I can't get through the exercise before she's on to the next thing.  I've tried a couple on the sculpt program.

I really like the ab/glute  work out you, can feel it working! i just had a baby a few months ago and this is just right for me to get toned up .i don't have alot of time and there are 11 min workout options..in main menu you pick over 15 mins under 15mins ..alot to choose from ..so far ive only done the one dvd tone and sculped and its kept me busy..the menus great and had a preview workout for ab glute arms and leg in one workout then you can just pick ab glutes...or arms legs so on.. theres workouts you can do that you use weights and ring but theres enough with out them and she even say you don't have to use them. So far i really like this  set and would recomend it to anyone who like a fast workout that you don't have to do arobics and be to cordiated to do..",1296864000,38,841,3.8554913294797686
4246729,5,B0041UUNU2,"highly recommend this set. great for beginner and intermediate. I've done several pilates dvds but consider myself beginning. i like the core/sculpt one where it explains every move in the beginning mode. I can be sure i am doing the movement correctly. i also do pilates from exercise tv on my cable, as well as purchased pilates by element for weight loss. i found this 3-dvd set to be the most comprehensive of all and you can move to advance levels. it's one of my must-work out dvds....of course i have like 75 different exercise dvds. try to rotate them so my workouts are never boring. highly recommend it!",1296604800,58,613,4.63302752293578
4246730,5,B0041UUNU2,"If you have been interested in trying Pilate but haven't been able to decide on one DVD, consider this box set.  Each of the 3 DVDs is completely different and all are good.  One is for people who have little flexibility.  It will get you up to the point of being able to take advantage of what Pilates has to offer.  The weight loss DVD is really for anyone and so is the sculpt & tone.  Both of these have a lot of workouts to choose from both different lengths and degrees of difficulty.  There is something on each DVD that you can do and benefit from no matter what your fitness level, flexibility or experience with Pilates.",1293321600,352,630,4.296610169491525

8413164,2,B0041UUNU2,"So far I hate this DVD set. I bought it based on the reviews and I'm pretty annoyed so far. I have tried the inflexible DVD, unless you are elderly or recovering from an injury this ""workout"" is absolutely useless. It's insanely slow and the movements are SO simple I never felt any stretching to improve my flexibility or any level of workout at all.
 So today I tried the weight loss DVD. I gave up about 5 min in, it's SO BORING, insanely slow and there no challenge. Also I want to point out that all the ""different"" workout selections are the same workout sequences but broken into smaller time segments and insanely slow. I will still give it a chance and if I change my mind I will update. But so far I'm mad I spent money on this.",1504742400,4,738,4.23404255319149
