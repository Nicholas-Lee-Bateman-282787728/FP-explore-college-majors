2559219,4,B000FBGA8K,"Just as humorous as I remember it. As a child, I looked forward to this show. It has great characters. It is dated I suppose, but funny and entertaining nevertheless.",1266364800,14,166,4.566666666666666
2559220,5,B000FBGA8K,"Very happy to be able to find it.  Glad that amazon.com continues to make available items from many years ago.  The quality is good and there has not been any problem with this item I purchased.  It was for a gift and I checked to make sure there was no problem, and that he had experienced good quality and clarity.

2559221,5,B000FBGA8K,My husband was young when these series came to tv. He likes this dvd and it was a gift for him. He was surprised.,1391817600,,113,3.75
2559222,4,B000FBGA8K,These episodes are great. This is what I grew up on as family TV. I wish we had some showes like this now.,1390176000,,106,3.652173913043478
2559223,4,B000FBGA8K,"I really surprised my husband with this one.  The episodes are scratchy and show their wear but what can you expect?  I'm glad I bought it for him, and he's very happy to have the set",1388275200,,183,4.055555555555555
2559224,5,B000FBGA8K,"Absolutely hilarious My wife and I haven,t stopped laughing.
I grew up on this show along with my parents and it brought
back a lot of memories. What more can you say about these
gifted actors that has not already bee said.

The Kinfish and Andy were as funny as ever. Along
with Sapphire and her Mother you just have to love it.
As a Black man I was very disappointed with the NACCP
and there stupid remarks about stereotyping
I have known a lot of George Stephens both White and Black

It's just human nature for people to have funny folks
like that in their neighborhood Thanks again for bringing
back some of the funny memories of my childhood.
Although quality was not that good it was viewable
but the original TV series was not that good either.
Still a good buy for the money. !!!",1377129600,4,788,4.35374149659864
2559225,5,B000FBGA8K,I bought this for my husband and he just loved it he thought that there was none out there but if you look you will find,1368403200,,120,3.6538461538461537
2559226,5,B000FBGA8K,"Excellent.  Haven't watched all episodes yet, but they're as I remember them.  Too bad racists took them off the air.  What's racist about one man hatching schemes to get the other man's money . . . . where humor is the central theme?",1360540800,2,234,4.395348837209302
2559227,5,B000FBGA8K,Enjoyed very much! Will order other items soon. Shipping was satisfactory. Probably will order other items near the end of the month.,1358899200,,133,5.090909090909091
2559228,4,B000FBGA8K,"Even funnier than I remembered. Some of the humor we've enjoyed over the past 50 yrs. came from these early shows. Eg. Archie Bunker and Meathead trying to go through the doorway at the same time was done long before. Kingfish and Andy did it some 20 years earlier.

Episodes are well-written, wholesome and very funny.",1357516800,,319,4.696428571428571
2559229,4,B000FBGA8K,"Pleased with product availability. Quality and price improvement would render 5 stars. Overall , it was good to find  this.",1356566400,,123,5.15
2559230,1,B000FBGA8K,Not at all satisfied with this DVD.  Especially the sound.  Just not at all clear and fades out in some scenes. Picture not the best in fact I have seen better.  Don't recommend this unless you are a collector.  Better DVDs out there.,1331078400,3,234,4.372093023255814
2559231,5,B000FBGA8K,I really needed a trip down memory lane and that is exactly what I got with this movie. I remember watching it as a child with my parents. Thanks for the laughter.,1330905600,,163,4.125
2559232,5,B000FBGA8K,"I grew up watching this show as a child.
I thought it was hilarious and still do.
Don't show this to your friends though, because it is politically incorrect.
Video quality is only so-so.",1327795200,,187,4.529411764705882
2559233,5,B000FBGA8K,I was very pleased with the transaction process while purchasing the Amos and Andy DVD.  I am giving it as a Christmas gift so I am unsure of the condition of the DVD at the present time.,1323302400,,187,4.054054054054054
2559234,3,B000FBGA8K,"Ok so this is a really old show so I suppose I shouldn't have expected much.  However, I found the picture and sound quality to be very poor.  It was obvious that this wasn't professionally recorded to DVD.  This is understandable because I've heard this show was pretty much banned from TV because some folks find it offensive.  Anyway, I got it for my 68 year-old father and he loved it because he used to watch it as a child.",1321833600,,428,4.3125
2559235,5,B000FBGA8K,The quality & sound was good for the age of the show.  I would purchase other DVDs frm this vendor.,1306022400,,99,3.95
2559236,5,B000FBGA8K,"I am thoroughly pleased with my DVDs. In reading some of the comments before ordering, I was concerned about the quality. The quality was pretty much what we got back then. Each and every one made me laugh with delight!",1300060800,,219,4.5
2559237,4,B000FBGA8K,One of the programs had no audio. Some have bad background. Over all not to bad for the age of the program,1295481600,9,106,3.8636363636363638
2559238,2,B000FBGA8K,"I got this for Christmas.  The video quality is terrible.  And while I understand that video quality wasn't the best when this show first aired...they could have done a better job with this dvd set.  In one episode the sound quality will be fair, while in the next, the volume and quality will be much lower.  So from episode to episode, I find that I must constantly adjust the volume.

Sometimes the screen will scroll like they used to do on older tvs.  And this is just something I never expected to find on a dvd.

Also, the episode titles air differently than what is printed on the disk.  so they are printed out of order.

Basically, what this 'seems' to be is a set of dvds pirated and sold at a flea market.  Not saying it is...but that's what it looks like.  Terrible quality.  And the ONLY reason I haven't sent them back is that I love the Amos & Andy show so much and I doubt I can find a better set.

But if you don't just absolutely love this series...skip this set.  It's not worth $5.",1293321600,16,1002,4.232804232804233
2559239,1,B000FBGA8K,"I had ordered a DVD pack and 3/4 of it was not audioable.  Amazon was very fast to replace it at no charges to me,but the same problem excits with the new DVDs.  I sent them a new e-mail informing them of the same problem, that was three and a half weeks ago and to date have not had a reply. I would sugest not wasting your money.",1282262400,17,331,3.8529411764705883
2559240,5,B000FBGA8K,"I purchased ""The Amos & Andy Show - Vol. 1-20 on DVD by Alvin Childress"" for a friend who was undergoing a ""last-ditch"" effort to survive cancer.  It gave him moments of joy and offered a respite from his constant thoughts of hopelessness.

I didn't know what to give this beautiful person who has given so much, to so many, but this turned out to be the perfect gift.",1278374400,2,368,4.318840579710145

8120084,5,B000FBGA8K,"DVDs arrived early.  Considering they were copies of shows on broadcast TV from the 1950s, I was very pleased with audio & video quality.  Bought these as gift for a friend - he really enjoyed them too!  Thanks!",1488931200,,211,4.5

8120088,2,B000FBGA8K,"Watched a little and it's in a drawer until I decide to keep it or toss it. Perhaps it's maturity now but when those shows were on TV and I was a kid, I thought they were hilarious. I see too much 'slap stick'. The jokes are almost predictable and so are the facial expressions. Not the walk down memory lane I want to take again.",1435276800,,330,4.015151515151516
8120089,5,B000FBGA8K,"Brought back some fond memories, really enjoyed seeing them again  ( the one Andy plays Santa Claus is a must see ).  As some have noted the video is not so good in some of them but those of us that remember the first days of TV this was considered not too bad of a picture and in a way that brings back some of the old charm of the show as we saw it then.",1434844800,,356,3.6710526315789473
