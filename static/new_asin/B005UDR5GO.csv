8486782,3,B005UDR5GO,"The historical parts of this video are fascinating as are the interveiws with the current staff.  However, the ghost stories are largely the same urban legend ghosts shared by most ""haunted"" locales and the scenes featuring Robert Richard Randall are far too silly and confusing given the actual timeline of the wonderful place and when the man had been alive.  The hiring of three separate ghost-hunting groups that yield really nothing but to add their presence to the colour of the movie seemed unnecessary to the overall story and smacked of simply pandering to the current craze of watching ghost-hunting TV shows... In all, it is a melange of ingredients that don't seem to have been mixed well.  But if you hang on to the historical parts, it makes seeing it worthwhile.",1354752000,,777,4.871212121212121
8486783,5,B005UDR5GO,"Your historical or paranormal library is not complete without this video!  Have you heard about Snug Harbor?  Neither had I but the producers make sure you know the full history from the perspective of a lost spirit as well as interviews with those that have seen and experienced activity at this place.

Shot on location, this documentary keeps the viewer riveted in their seat as we travel through time with the ghost as he tries to remember what happened to him at Snug Harbor.  Finding out how and why Snug Harbor helped the sailors is a plus and is sure to please those that love Americana.

Be sure to watch for 'Old Salty'; played by a knowledgeable person in the paranormal field.  What an added bonus!",1326499200,,710,4.595238095238095
8486784,5,B005UDR5GO,"We were at the premiere last night (Oct 21st) and are hungry, so to speak, for another view from the DVD we received upon entering the theatre. The film unto itself for any historian, paranormal researcher or investigator will without a doubt satisfy a multi-disciplinary approach to this subject. With numerous experts commenting on the history of Snug Harbor itself (one in particular is Barnett Shepherd author of _Sailors Snug Harbor 1801-1976_) , plus leading experts in the Paranormal field (SCARED!, NEW YORK PARANORMAL SOCIETY & STATEN ISLAND PARANORMAL SOCIETY) the viewer will be taken on a very enlightening journey throughout the 150+ years of Snug Harbor history.  The film tours the grounds of Snug Harbor, historically but then takes the viewer to numerous ""hot spots"" of paranormal activity. The information presented on the paranormal side to the site is expertly coupled by the historical perspectives of these areas.
This tour does not just cite what the legends and stories considered paranormal activity are, the Paranormal Teams featured did numerous & exhaustive investigations of the paranormal claims.  The evidence they include in the film will blow you away. Not only do you have historical facts, legendary stories, and paranormal claims but you will witness evidence of paranormal activity at Snug Harbor.
If you have an interest in any of these topics then you cannot go wrong with your purchase of this DVD. We have not yet checked out the extra features but will update our review to reflect a full viewing of all the DVD features and a lengthier more in depth review.",1319241600,3,1600,5.079847908745247
