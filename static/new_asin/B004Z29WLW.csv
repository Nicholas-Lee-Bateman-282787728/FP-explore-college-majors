4505518,5,B004Z29WLW,"In the wake of negative commentary that has overtaken the media in discussions about the state of American education, this documentary puts the spotlight on the value of a good teacher. It demonstrates how years after we exit our school aged years, we can look back and identify the teachers who used their talents to mold us as students into responsible, caring, and empathetic adults.  There's no mention of test scores but what teachers provided was invaluable and not easily measured. Thundersoul should be seen by a wide audience since it's message holds so much more insight than the more popular Waiting for Superman. It demonstrates how Superman does exist in classrooms across our nation.",1330214400,11,697,5.060869565217391
4505519,5,B004Z29WLW,"The story of the Kashmere High School Stage Band is like a real-life Glee plotline: music teacher attends Otis Redding concert, and hits upon the idea of having the band students bring the funk. More than 40 years after the kids first got together to put on a show, the meager recorded output of these Texas schoolkids is prized by hip hop DJs looking for the perfect beat -- and it's the subject of Thunder Soul, an agreeable documentary narrated by Jamie Foxx that tells the story of the coolest band geeks ever. The students reunite to pay tribute to their teacher, Conrad ""Prof"" Johnson, and play some of the old songs, and they can still put on a show --  I grooved to this fascinating slice of pop culture history.",1328054400,9,720,4.4961832061068705

4505521,5,B004Z29WLW,"I've seen this documentary twice in documentary festivals and love it! Great storytelling and fantastic music. I'm so excited it will be released soon as a DVD so I can share it with friends.
This is a tale of a high school reunion and friends reunited - laughing about their hair in high school and telling stories of what they have done for the last 40 years. It is a thank you to music in schools and a special teacher who touched so many students' lives. It is a part of the history of the US and of funk music. You'll laugh and cry - and leave dancing to the music in your head. Well worth watching over and over again.  (and there's a CD of the original music!)",1325116800,21,667,4.170542635658915

Also the band members and Prof - just wonderful people.  Even the clothes and hairstyles they wore in the look-backs made me feel good.  Highly recommended.  I saw it in the theatre and now I want to see it again.  Maybe that's because I just got back from a Tower of Power/Average White Band show! Dating myself? Yes!

4505523,5,B004Z29WLW,"I just got back from seeing this film, and the funny thing is, I wasn't sure if I felt up to going since I was feeling kinda sleepy. Boy am I glad I went, this is the best damn film I've seen in some time. It was one of the most inspirational films I've ever seen and it's a must see for all black teens. In fact, it's the perfect film for parents to watch with their young teens and pre-teens. It would make an excellent film to watch with the holiday season coming up.

Talk about 'role models', Conrad 'Prof' Johnson is the epitome of the term, and the band is/was AWESOME!!!  This film will leave you feeling uplifted and joyous, trust me you won't regret seeing this one.",1319068800,,676,4.1923076923076925

4505534,5,B004Z29WLW,"This should be required viewing for all music educators. As one myself, it was inspiring to learn about a teacher and a program that found their groove. Music director, Conrad Johnson, understood that students can learn - and learn well - if you make the learning vehicle something that appeals to them. In this case, it was funky grooves that were popular in the late 60's and early 70's. ""Prof""'s success was also due to his ability and willingness to accentuate the students' musical strengths by providing custom songs and arrangements that he himself composed. In addition, Mr. Johnson mentions more than once that to be good takes more than just talent; it also takes hard work and discipline. Throughout the movie Johnson's love for music is evident, and so is his concern that his students learn music skills, as well as life skills.

From a production standpoint, this documentary exudes respect and affection. The film makers do a great job of telling a complete story; one that continues to unfold to, and into, the end credits.  A balanced amount of background info, personal stories,  interviews - and of course music - pull in the viewer and create an emotional tie to Mr. Johnson.

If the events of this movie weren't true and factual you would think it was a made-for-TV-script.  (At the risk of spoiling the story for someone who has yet to see this movie) The story begins when Mr. Johnson is already 91 or 92 years old. A reunion/tribute concert is being planned, and as rehearsals begin ""Prof"" begins to have health issues. He suffers a mild heart attack and goes to the hospital. The day of the concert he tells the doctors he IS going to the the show. Two days later he passes away, and within a few more days a statue of Prof is dedicated at the high school. All of this happens in real time. In other words, the film makers were present for all the events and allowed to film each (be sure and watch the audio commentary in the special features with the director, and film editor). The events and documentation provide a proper and moving conclusion to this great story of a caring and motivating teacher.

Highly recommend for all music teachers, music lovers, and those who work with young people.",1452297600,,2223,4.672634271099744

This story will make you cry. . . and if you're a teacher, you will be reminded of why you went into teaching. When the band began winning awards for their music - locally, state-wide, nation-wide - everyone at the school was affected. Math scores began to soar. They began winning spelling bees, debate tournaments, you name it. This teacher and his students raised the esteem of everyone. . .and Kashmere High became a legend.
Must see for everyone. . . student, teachers. . . we are all students or have been students.

The Funk music from the seventies, which I usually do not like is surprisingly full of joy.  This true story can touch your heart, if like me your heart has become a stone, start beating with a beat that won't stop.  On first viewing, I cried with both grief and joy.  And when I finally owned the DVD and viewed it for the second time, same result, I needed tissues.  The DVD made a great gift for two of my sons who are both involved in music education and great musicians because of the love and discipline instilled in them by their band directors and orchestra conductors.

4505558,5,B004Z29WLW,"I'm being selfish about Thunder Soul and Prof as other Kashmere Stage Band members would be. Mr. Conrad O. Johnson was more than a band director or academic preceptor, he was a family man and our dear friend.

He blessed us with his guidance, his strength, his creative thought and more saliently, his love for us. God was his guiding light. He believed in Fine Arts. He believed in academic achievement. He felt they were one in the same.

Concluding, The Conrad O. Johnson Music and Fine Arts Foundation, The Conrad Johnson Orchestra, The Kashmere Stage Band, The Legacy Group and The ThunderSOUL Orchestra and the Johnson family's mission is to sustain his legacy.

We are committed to teaching every student around this world about Prof, his legacy, his focus which was God, family, students, academic achievement and fine arts.

Prof was brilliance and there are only a few like him left, i.e., Quincy Jones, Maurice White, etc. #AcademicsMatter #FineArtsMatter #StudentsMatter #GuidanceMatters

Thunder Soul is Prof's story, our story and now it's your story. Thank you all and God bless.

Love, Peace & ThunderSOUL!!

The story of the reunion of the members of the Kashmere Stage Band is extremely moving, while the music they made is intensely funky! Band leader Conrad Johnson blew the doors off what a high school stage band could be when he introduced funk music and choreographed moves, and brought his kids to an amazing level of excellence and precision with a combination of discipline and love. This movie will engage anyone who is interested in 70s funk, social history, or how people touch each others' lives.

I am one of the members of the band and I must say this is right on point as it was back in the seventies during my time with the Kashmere Stag Band and my teenier at Kashmere Sr High. If Conrad (Prof) Johnson had not given me the opportunity to join the advance jazz band before my time I would not have experience the trip to Japan as a professional jazz artist which was a great trip. This movie tells you how Conrad loved us students by how he taught musicianship, respect, and professionalism learning to be responsible young men and women. Those were times I will cherish and funny as it may sound, those were the best years of my life as a high school teenager. Mark Landsman, great job! Thank You!

Thank god a documentary was made to capture, and continue, the legend of Prof Conrad Johnson; what an inspirational guide for all students who carried his influence throughout their lives. Kashmere's timing for a reunion right before his death was exquisite. It really broke my heart, and Conrad's, to know his project/his baby had been cast out of the system.

My high school choir director inspired me, and, 30 years later, a bunch of us got together to form the Alumni Choir, with our original director (almost 90, still sharp as a tack). Yes, I can relate. ""Prof"" Johnson reminded me a lot of our choir director, Raymond Dietrich, who was just awarded a life-time achievement award from the Civic Music Assoc in Milwaukee. Indeed, it's a privilege to be in the presence of such inspiration, and it's a shame more kids won't be subjected to such greatness and inspiration. Our choir didn't win such prestigious awards as Prof Johnson's band, but that Johnson lifted these inner-city kids beyond a less-pleasant outcome is so very much to be commended.

I know what a stage band is now!  I was really inspired by the music in this movie!  As good as the music was it didn't compare to the admiration,respect,commitment,and love,the musicians have for the beloved Prof!!!  OUTSTANDING!!!",1339545600,,380,4.681818181818182
4505583,5,B004Z29WLW,"This documentary was wonderful. As a Jr.high and high school band member this is so needed. Many schools are loosing music and the arts. Music kept me consistent in so many other areas of my life. The importance of respect, discipline, practice, and team work is all encompassed in the film. I love that they are giving credit to the man that made the music. Wonderfully done. This is a family movie. Great Job. I'm online now to buy the MP3 and the vinyl just to have.",1336867200,,469,4.402298850574713
4505584,5,B004Z29WLW,"Much like the award-winning documentary ""Drumline"", ""Thunder Soul"" shows how a strong-willed and loving teacher can truly ""make a difference"" in the lives of children living in the poorer or more crime-ridden areas of a city. This 88-minute film  (produced in 2010) focuses on the Kashmere (Texas) High School Stage Band and it's music director Conrad ""Prof"" Johnson. One of the most award-winning stage bands in the country, Kashmere's band only existed because of ""Prof"". He ran the coed musical aggregation of black students in this ward in Houston, with a ""tough love"" and a code of conduct and respect. And the students we hear from in the many interviews let us know that, with out Prof's support and guidance they'd probably be using, or selling, drugs today.

The action which forms the core of the film takes place in 2008 when a couple of band alumni from the 1971-4 period - just before Prof retired - decide to find all the old band members - now scattered around the country, with most having not lifted their instruments in years - and hold a ""reunion concert"" for the then 93 year old teacher. We watch as they come together and practice for the ""big night"". Director Mark Landesman interviews Prof in these later years but also incorporates clips from a 1974 documentary on the band titled ""Prof & the Band"". A 16-minute segment from the 1974 film is one of the two bonus features. The other is a full-length commentary by the Landesman and his Editor.

Unlike ""Drumline"" where we follow the students up to a competition, here we follow them as they reminisce and try to recapture the ""team"" spirit of their glory years, nearly 40 years earlier. (Spoiler alert: they do!).

Near the end of the film Prof says he ""gave them pride, (he) gave them honor and (he) gave them excellent performance"". That pretty much sums up the spirit of this film which will lift your spirits too!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

A fantastic musician and composer in his own right that chose instead to dedicate 35 years to nurturing black students in the south. Through an innovative approach to teaching Funk music, a genuine love for his students and commitment to his personal musical craft he developed the greatest competitive high school Jazz band in U.S. history. In this movie, his students come back together after 30 years to pay tribute to the man who transformed their lives by recreating their award winning performance he originally composed for them. 2 days after the concert he passed away at the age of 92. He is survived by an incredible legacy which illustrates the profound impact teachers have in shaping the world.",1527379200,,877,4.89261744966443
