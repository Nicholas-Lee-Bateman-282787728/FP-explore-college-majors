5555078,3,B00B4HM4UC,Movie is in Black & White which is okay with me.  It's a family movie which I like but this movie just didn't hold my interest.,1418860800,,127,3.8846153846153846

5555083,4,B00B4HM4UC,I watched this around Christmas. I watched it with my Roku. It worked just fine no problems. I thought it was a good story. I think it is a good movie for the whole family. I enjoyed it! I would watch it again.,1396569600,,210,3.9069767441860463
5555084,3,B00B4HM4UC,"A down under take on Christmas in a time and area where life can be harsh. Bad guys were similar to Laurel and Hardy. But could be fun for a family to watch, especially if they have a fondness for horses.",1388448000,,204,4.0
5555085,1,B00B4HM4UC,"Like the other reviewer, I am also on a Roku connection.  Please fix the audio because I really want to see this!",1366070400,2,113,4.136363636363637
8562313,5,B00B4HM4UC,"this is a 'strong' film from the 'antipodes'. the acting is 'outstanding' for a 'young' cast, but essentially the strong points go to the 'veteran' actors in the crew.
fun viewing for the whole 'family'.",1513900800,,203,4.828571428571428
8562314,5,B00B4HM4UC,"I enjoyed it, but I'm a bit bias since I'm a fan of Nicole Kidman.  You can also watch a teen Kidman in the better adventure Aussie film ""BMX Bandits"" (1983) fighting baddies using her bicycling skills.",1513468800,,202,4.45945945945946
8562315,3,B00B4HM4UC,Slow and boring.,1488931200,,16,4.666666666666667
8562316,5,B00B4HM4UC,just as frightening as when i was a 6 year old iam 74 now really enjoyed it,1484438400,,75,3.4705882352941178
8562317,3,B00B4HM4UC,"interesting to see a vintage austrtalian film.  semi related to christmas.  this is a remake notable mainly for the credit  ""Introducing Nicole Kidman""
not a particularly sharp image and there are color density changed throughout.  think ""B movie"" with even lower budget than you might expect.  still, it has its charms.  and is a christmas relted film i had never heard of.  might be time to watch the 1947 original of the same name this one i based on to see whet they liked/changed.",1481587200,,485,4.7023809523809526
8562318,1,B00B4HM4UC,So uninteresting I couldn't even finish it.,1455494400,,43,5.285714285714286
8562319,5,B00B4HM4UC,Great to see Nicole Kidman before she started chain smoking.,1440633600,,60,5.1
8562320,2,B00B4HM4UC,Did not know until after I bought this there was a PRESSED dvd available from Echo Bridge for a cheaper price.  now comparing Quality..  okay I paid for the cover.  The cover is way better than the $6.99 Echo Bridge release which the way the cover is.  Could be confused for a 1940's film I've also looked at with the same name,1433721600,,327,4.225806451612903
8562321,3,B00B4HM4UC,a good clean movie and kept the kids attention.,1426636800,,47,4.333333333333333
