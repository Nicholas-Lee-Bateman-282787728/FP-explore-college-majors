5271896,5,B0095XJ7OI,RELAXING WAY TO SPEND FUN TIME WITH THE FAMILY. All Psychology classes in college should review and discuss as  it plays a con games/venture  ideas etc. We will be ordering more films...thanks for the service. Woody,1377388800,,215,4.944444444444445
5271897,5,B0095XJ7OI,"From Noon Until Three is a cleaver satirical screenplay examining the nature of women, men, and their differences.  Great entertainment for non-Western viewers as well as Western enthusiasts.  Music by E Bernstein, a Victorian set that will amaze the viewer as much as it amazed Gram Dorsey, and succinct acting create a technically strong movie. This movie transcends the Bronson/Ireland partnership that we are accustomed to.  TGG product is very good - thank you TGG for taking notice of a movie that has not received the attention that it deserves.",1376697600,,552,5.111111111111111
5271898,5,B0095XJ7OI,"What a delightful film.
Full of mystery, passion, and mainly imaginative fantasies.
It may start out like a typical western, but it just gets better, more entertaining, and funnier as the film progresses.
I loved it so much I bought three extra copies for good friends",1375488000,3,268,4.8478260869565215
5271899,5,B0095XJ7OI,"I have not seen From Noon Til Three, but have seen Assassination. Think Charles Bronson movies are great. So that is why gave it a five rating.",1375056000,2,143,4.333333333333333
5271900,5,B0095XJ7OI,I have never seen the Assassin but just loved from Noon Till Three.  Glad to have them both in my film library.  I just love Charles Bronson and Jill Ireland,1374364800,,157,4.2
5271901,5,B0095XJ7OI,"I purchased From Noon Till Three / Assassination because I wanted From Noon Till Three.  Both movies star Charles Bronson & Jill Ireland.  Both movies are on one disc.  Theyre both letterboxed and look great.

I love From Noon Till Three (from 1976, 99 minutes), a humorous western with many fun twists and turns.  Bronson is a member of a gang of outlaws planning to rob a bank.  He fears the robbery will go wrong and arranges to be left behind at the home of a young widow (Ireland).  She is an upstanding lady who wants nothing to do with an outlaw, but he gets her to see things differently.  Perhaps theyll live happily ever after, except . . . things get very complicated.

Im not as fond of Assassination (from 1987, 88 minutes), but its a fairly good story.  Bronson is the agent assigned to guard the First Lady (Ireland).  She doesnt want to follow the rules and refuses to believe she might be in any danger.  It seems somebody is targeting them, but is it someone trying to assassinate the Presidents wife as a political maneuver, or is it someone trying to take revenge on Bronson for something from his past?  And how is it that the badguys keep finding them?",1371254400,13,1174,4.455399061032864
5271902,5,B0095XJ7OI,"I am so grateful that this fabulous and rare movie was finally made available on DVD and at such a great price.  You can't go wrong with the hilarity and humor in this rare Charles Bronson/Jill Ireland comedy.  From the first time I saw this movie way back in the early 80's, I have wanted it in my library and now, this many years later, I finally have it.  Both movies are on one side of the disc, but picture quality does not suffer.  This is a must for any Charles Bronson fan -- you can't go wrong!",1368576000,6,503,4.1020408163265305
5271903,5,B0095XJ7OI,"Saw this movie years ago (From Noon Til Three), have looked for it periodically but not willing to pay the higher price.  Finally able to enjoy it without breaking the bank.  Fun way to see Bronson in another light.",1365033600,5,215,4.487179487179487
5271904,5,B0095XJ7OI,I really enjoyed the movie it was great seeing Bronson in a different role than the usual action role. I like Jill Ireland in the more substancial role than she otherwise plays.,1360368000,,177,4.5625

5271916,2,B0095XJ7OI,"I only saw the From Noon Til Three film and will comment on it.
This is a silly film. As I watched, I thought that Bronson and Ireland must have run out of cash and were forced to do this film. It is about an unsuccessful gangster whose horse went lame, and he had to wait at Ireland's house while his four pals went to rob a bank in town. He seduces Ireland by telling her that he has been unable to have sex since the woman he loved died. Ireland is a widow of a 67-year-old man who died a few years ago. She is probably around 30. She feels sorry for him and engages in sex with him to cure him. Then she falls in love with him.
One of the four robbers who went to town to rob the bank was shot and killed. The other three were captured and were about to be hung. Bronson is urged by Ireland to go to town and find a way to save them. He leaves to ostensibly go to town, but really to stay away long enough to say he tried. He is pursued by a posse who apparently - it wasn't clear - knew he was part of the gang. He holds up a man, knocks him out, and takes his clothes. He is captured, and the posse thinks that the unconscious man is Bronson and shoot and kill him. They think that Bronson is the other man and Bronson is tried for the other man's crime and sentenced to a year in jail.
A writer hears about the three hours Bronson spent with Ireland and asks her for the story. She makes one up and the story becomes a world-wide best seller. Then the film becomes sillier. Among other acts, Bronson is released from prison, comes to town wearing a fake beard and removes it so that he can scratch himself, which bewilders a young girl.",1477526400,,1643,3.9969604863221884

5271918,5,B0095XJ7OI,"Noon Till Three is one of my all time favorite movies; not a Bronson movie fan, but this one is definitely well worth a look! Very tongue in cheek and a great social commentary!",1476748800,,177,4.235294117647059
5271919,3,B0095XJ7OI,"From most of the other reviews I have read most people bought this for From Noon Until Three.  Which is why I bought it.  It is a change of pace for Charles Bronson.  Not a straight ahead comedy but not really a straight ahead western or action movie either.  Bronson and Jill Ireland have good chemistry and they were really married.  And Jill Ireland gives maybe her best performance.  I think I read somewhere that she said it was her favorite.  And she sings pretty good too.
I wouldn't have bought Assassination by itself.  It's more of a typical tough guy action movie for Bronson.  And it has Jill Ireland in it too.  She plays the First lady and he is a Secret Service Agent protecting her.  They don't get along and she is pretty bitchy.  She does look good riding a motorcycle.",1475107200,2,787,4.426573426573427

5271933,2,B0095XJ7OI,"Bronson and Ireland did fourteen films together, but these aren't very good examples. From Noon Till Three is never quite funny enough, and Assassination is just a dumb story, even by Golan-Globus standards. Bronson is better when he has more believable adversaries, and Ireland is better when she has more to do than pout and look perfect. Breakheart Pass is a much better film with a much better cast, as are Hard Times and Breakout. While Ireland's role is minimal, Bronson's best performance is probably the French film, Rider on the Rain. Any of the four are worth buying, even if you don't appreciate Bronson's minimalist approach. If you want Bronson sans Ireland, get Mr. Majestyk or Sergio Leone's masterpiece, Once Upon a Time in the West.",1425081600,,749,4.905511811023622

5271943,5,B0095XJ7OI,"I first saw Noon Til Three on a late show when I lived in Cambridge (MA). I had the TV on mostly for noise. AS the flilck unfolded, it became more and more interesting, such that, at the end, I was sitting in awe.

Charles Bronson puts on a masterful performance, playing against his wife, Jill Ireland. The plot twists are unexpected, but refreshing. The closing scene is worth the price of admission.

Look closely at the widow's (Jill Ireland) house. I'm pretty sure it's the same one used in Psycho. Does tat tell you something?",1398988800,,532,4.53125
5271944,3,B0095XJ7OI,"The good one is ""From Noon till Three."" Charles Bronson in an unusual, comedic role. People of a small Western town condemn a young widow lady (Ireland) for her brief affair with a charming but otherwise mediocre outlaw (Bronson), who is believed to be dead after a botched bank robbery.  But after a city slicker novelist turns the story of Graham and Amanda into an international  sensation, with melodramas and popular songs celebrating their tragic love story, the town becomes a tourist attraction, and the lady a worshiped celebrity.  What happens when Graham comes back from ""the dead?"" The script was adapted and the film directed by Frank D. Gilroy, author of the novel of the same name, and he did a great job of adapting his own material. The husband and wife team of Bronson and Ireland were never better.
""Assasination,"" however, is a forgettable Secret Service drama with a made-for-TV feel.  Macho agent (late-career Bronson) protects ultra-feminist First Lady (Ireland) from bomb-flinging assasins and solves the mystery of why she is targeted.  Naturally these two opposites attract. Lots of schlocky banter between two cardboard characters, plenty of guns, bombs, and motorcycles. You get the picture.  Buy this DVD for ""From Noon till Three."" Note- both films are on one disk",1395532800,3,1294,5.080188679245283
5271945,5,B0095XJ7OI,Having 2 movies on 1 CD is great value. CD format is much better than VHS  because you can skip around quickly to parts you wish to see.,1394409600,,136,3.857142857142857
5271946,5,B0095XJ7OI,"This is an real classic,some humor also. You've got to watch this in order to understand. Definitly worth the money.

5271948,4,B0095XJ7OI,"Assassination:  Some of the worst acting in a movie since the old Ed Wood films of the 50s.  However, the story is exciting and there's plenty of action if you can get around the acting.

From Noon Til Three:  This is why I bought the DVD.  One of the best ironic comedies I've ever seen.  Could have been based on the Younger gang's robbery of the Northfield, MN bank, except for the comedic romantic interlude and the ironic aftermath.  Charlie and Jill were definitely better at comedy than drama.",1379894400,2,500,4.550561797752809
5271949,4,B0095XJ7OI,"You can't go wrong with Charles Bronson.  And ""From Noon Til Three"" is one of his lesser known comedic roles with his beautiful wife Jill Ireland.
