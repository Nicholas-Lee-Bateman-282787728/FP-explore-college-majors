7801992,5,1936045699,"I am a transitional deacon preparing for ordination as a priest.  This DVD is a wonderful resource to learn not only how to celebrate Mass in the Ordinary Form, but to celebrate it well.  Unfortunately, many in my generation and before have only been exposed to the liturgy celebrated poorly and not as the Church intends.  This provides an excellent model to follow, although in some respects, it is too short.  It doesn't really cover Mass with a deacon or Mass with incense.  That being said, it's a very good place to start to begin learning how to celebrate Mass according to the ordinary form of the Roman Rite.",1456444800,,617,4.623853211009174
