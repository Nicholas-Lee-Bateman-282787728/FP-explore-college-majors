I own the first two season and have ordered the third already.  Loosen up have fun and just enjoy.",1183420800,5,267,3.8
2863204,5,B000R9YLKY,"if you like dramas with arrogant doctors, this is the show for you. Seasons 1 and 2 were great, but I'd say this is the best of all three seasons...and hopefully more to come. You should definetly buy this season!!!",1183075200,9,215,4.4
2863205,5,B000R9YLKY,"Hugh Laurie, comical genious, awesome musician, great dramatic actor, and a very handsome Brit. If you haven't seen House MD yet I would just suggest you check it out it is a great show.",1182384000,7,186,4.5
2863206,5,B000R9YLKY,"That incredibly crabby doctor with the serious leg pain is back for the third season of the acclaimed medical series ""House, M.D."" And once again Hugh Laurie and company came up with another winner of a season, although in my opinion it was just a tad notch below the first two seasons. Still, ""House"" season three is still very much worth watching.

Laurie once again dominates season three as he did with seasons one and two, and come Emmy time he better be rewarded! (He's already won two Golden Globes and one Screen Actors Guild award for his portrayal of Dr. House.) Being snubbed for a nomination for season two was a crime! His performances throughout season three was probably some of the best acting that Laurie has done on the show so far, thanks in part to one major storyline early in the season. David Morse was introduced in the fifth episode as Detective Tritter, a cop who comes to the hospital as a patient. Guess which doctor he ends up getting? Before you know it, Dr. House starts off by treating him rude, and if that's not bad enough, pops Vicodin right in front of him. Later on, he arrests Dr. House for possession of drugs, and thereafter tries in every way to make the cranky doc's life miserable (such as when Dr. House has to go for days without Vicodin and ends up in rehab). In addition, these turn of events also put a disturbing effect on his team, as the cop pressures each team member to give him some answers about their boss. This was a very strong storyline, and Morse was excellent in the role of the ticked off cop.

Sure ""House"" is the Hugh Laurie show, but lets not forget about the superb supporting cast: Lisa Edelstein as hospital administrator Lisa Cuddy; Omar Epps as neurologist Eric Foreman; Robert Sean Leonard as oncology specialist James Wilson; Jennifer Morrison as immunologist Allison Cameron; and Jesse Spencer as intensive-care specialist Robert Chase are all back for season three, and they're better than ever. For all three seasons these actors are given plenty to do in support of Laurie, and each of them does a great job playing off not only Laurie but each other. This is thanks to some terrific writing by creator David Shore and his writing team. They not only make this show compelling but smart as well. My favorite episode from season three is the one titled ""Airborne"", where House and Cuddy board a plane departing Malaysia that soon becomes a hospital ward when several passengers become seriously ill (including Cuddy); while back at Princeton-Plainsboro Wilson, Chase, Cameron, and Foreman try to solve a medical mystery on their own. This is a great episode, maybe the best overall episode of the show so far. It's not only thrilling and dramatic, but funny and shocking as well. Other great episodes include the second episode ""Cane and Able"", in which House and his team try to figure out why a 7 year old boy thinks he's being tortured by aliens, and the next-to-last episode ""The Jerk"", in which Dr. House meets his match with his latest patient: a teenage chess player with an arrogant attitude that's even worse than House's.

Despite this show's greatness, I had a few quibbles on the third season of ""House"". One season three episode didn't work for me (episode #12 - ""One Day, One Room""). I found this episode kind of dull and not all that interesting. It's not real bad, but I just didn't seem to care about it all that much, which makes it the weakest episode of ""House"" so far. One minor storyline that was also kind of silly was the sexual hook-ups between Chase and Cameron, which featured them getting down and dirty in the hospital, in a patient's house, etc. And it was only for fun. Chase wants a relationship, but Cameron doesn't. This really isn't smart writing on the part of the writing team on ""House"". I think it was only thrown in their due to the real-life engagement of the actors who play Chase and Cameron (Jesse Spencer and Jennifer Morrison got engaged midway through season three). But in all fairness, I think this storyline would have worked better if the writers had done exactly what Chase wanted: let them have a relationship. These actors do look great together. I think a serious relationship storyline between Chase and Cameron would be awesome. Perhaps that might come later.

Familiar faces who show up for guest appearances during season three include: John Larroquette (""Night Court""), Kathleen Quinlan (""Apollo 13""), Joel Grey (""Cabaret""), Charles S. Dutton (""The Piano Lesson""), Piper Perabo (""Coyote Ugly""), Kurtwood Smith (""That `70s Show""), and pop star Dave Matthews.

The final episode of season three apparently will be opening the door for changes when season four debuts in the fall, as House lost his entire team (Foreman and Cameron resigned; Chase fired). I'm hoping that this will not be the end for some members of this great ensemble cast. I love this cast on ""House"", and if any one of these cast members leave the show or end up being let go, I will be very saddened by it. But this is the show's big cliffhanger for the summer. We'll eventually find out what will happen when season four returns this fall. And my fingers are crossed that all these cast members return.",1182297600,74,5207,4.711306256860593
2863207,5,B000R9YLKY,"as a healthcare provider, i realize how far-fetched the story lines are, however, this is by far one of the most entertaining shows on TV now! The entire cast is witty and charming, and Laurie's sarcastic manner is so very entertaining!!",1182124800,5,237,4.804878048780488
2863208,4,B000R9YLKY,"If you are watching HOUSE because you want cheap medical advice for your symptoms, you are misled, to say the least.  I would give nearly anything to verbally joust with a doctor like this.  He's painfully honest; accutely perceptive; adorable, in a rustic way; and at least you would know where you stand when he walked out the door.  I had a vet like this guy, once, and it was so refreshing to get what you paid for.  Too many doctors tiptoe around feelings, scared to death they will have to crank up the malpractic insurance coverage.  Hugh Laurie does an awesome job of being a genius in his field, and a sarcastic S.O.B. who no one can truly hate.  I have surmised that House will end up donating the sperm for Cutty's offspring...  let's face it, they are two peas in a pod (lonely, somewhat despirate for love, and misunderstood most of the time)... but that doesn't take the series very far.  And what's happening with the other characters?  Would they REALLY leave the show?  The interaction between House and new personalities would give the show a whole new twist...  not to mention, those new folks would have some pretty big shoes to fill.  All this said, I reccommend this series as a must have.  On those rainy days, when nothing else is appealing on the tube... you can always count on HOUSE to give you intense entertainment and force the gray matter to unravel each plot, sub-plot, and ultimate plot's mystery.",1182038400,9,1430,4.604743083003952
2863209,4,B000R9YLKY,"From the outset let me say that this is a fun series to watch. That being said one should not put to much faith in realism being displayed.  Most of the episodes of this series have become rather predictable i.e. patient is admitted, patient has convulsions.  Patient gets Cat Scan or MRI. Patient nearly dies from various treatments.  Patient finally recovers when correct procedures are found.  The vast majority of the episodes follow this form. In addition one is left to wonder how the hospital could afford the lawsuits that would arise from House's caustic personality as he insults patients,guardians and co-workers with his verbal abuse not to mention questionable medical procedures.  Finally for that added touch the spouse or guardian of the patient always seems to be present when the patient begins to have problems to add to the tension.  The items that hook you on this program is not areas I have previously outlined, but rather the fun of watching a really cranky somewhat mentally unbalanced genius doctor go about his work.  What will he say this week to abuse someone or everyone what rare disease will come to light to explain the patients problems.  The backgrounds of the principal supporting characters  are becoming more filled in and with this seasons certain tensions explode. As stated at the begining this is a fun show to watch it pulls you back in every week however, a growing soap opera feel now is starting to become more notable. The writers to their credit have allowed the occasional failure or patient to die something earlier medical shows tended to avoid which does enhance the series.",1181692800,8,1626,4.905109489051095
2863210,5,B000R9YLKY,"I love this show. I own the first two seasons and I have to say number 3 is the charm. I never know what House is going to do next and that is half the fun.

2863211,4,B000R9YLKY,"You have to give the ""House"" production team credit.  Your show has the ""American Idol"" lead-in and is often the highest-rated scripted drama on TV.  However, instead of playing it safe with disease-of-the week plots, ""House"" swung for the fences several times: putting its main character in jail and threatening him with prison; ramping up the conflicts between all six of the main characters; and ending the year with a big cliffhanger that threatened to cut the main cast in half.  Even when a given episode wasn't advancing the progressive storyline, the writers attempted to push the envelope with several politically themed episodes.

Early in Season 3, the big storyline revolved around recurring guest star David Morse, a detective out to get House and his questionable supply of Vicodin.  In previous years, lengthy story arcs were given to Chi McBride and Sela Ward: would House lose his job?  would House get married?  This year, the theme was: would House go to prison?  Morse dominated his episodes by playing the rare character that wouldn't back down to House.  Although some media critics grew tired of the plot, which perhaps went on 2-3 episodes too long, the resolution was clever and allowed House to keep his dignity (and his job) without having to sacrifice... anything.

Several subplots emerged throughout the season, such as the romance between Drs. Chase and Cameron (first shown in season 2), and Dr. Foreman's growing dissatisfaction with having House as his mentor.  House's fascination (or, some might say, obsession) with his boss, Dr. Cuddy, reached new levels.  By the end of the season, House faced near mutiny from his underlings... and still didn't seem all that bothered.  Perhaps House was too busy counseling a patient to end his life, or faking cancer in order to get a supply of pain medications.  Perhaps he was dodging the romantic advances of a teenager, or trading in his case for a wheelchair in order to recover his handicapped parking spot.  The more outrageous the behavior, the better Hugh Laurie was in the role.  He even upgraded his cane to a model decorated with stars.

Standout guest stars this season included John Larroquette as a man waking up from a decade-long coma, Joel Grey as an ailing doctor, Dave Matthews as a stunted piano prodigy, and the return of Charles S. Dutton as Foreman's dad.

While the ""House"" season DVDs are never what you'd call packed with extras, the tightly knotted plots and the rapid-fire dialogue makes this a great show to watch more than once.  Also try and track down plot-lines that never quite went anywhere, like Cuddy's rumored pregnancy or her not-quite romance with Wilson.

""House"" season 3 drew top ratings while continuing with the show's unflinching dialogue and medical situations.  This may not have been a great year for ""Grey's Anatomy"" or ""E.R."", so cruise on over to Princeton Plainsborough for a few hours of intense hospital drama.",1180915200,170,2941,4.973415132924336

2863213,5,B000R9YLKY,"As its hard to separate the seasons, I'll be posting a generic for all. House is a doctor who has more than a few issues, but is brillant so is allowed to get away with his rude, offensive, and at times, dangerous behavior. All this makes it so that the show never has a dull moment as the viewer isn't quite sure what House will do next or if he will be stopped in time. There are a lot of great moments and even for those who aren't fans of medical shows, this is still a show that should be checked out. It is not a family show as there is crude humor, but at least the viewer is never board.",1514160000,2,595,3.925619834710744

Last season's cliffhanger was fantastic, House being shot and his subsequent hallucination, and the first few episodes dealt with it well. The kinder, gentler House was fun to watch. Then it went through a prolonged down period, with the Tritter story line, but picked up speed and entertainment value when that story line saw through to its conclusion. What happened after that was a reflection of House in all his patients. Many of these cases were good and were really more about an exploration of his many parts. And the way the season came to a conclusion was fantastic and the finale could not have been better, even if it left us with more questions than answers.

While the conflict between characters was nicer than in previous seasons, it began to get a tad bit tedious in the medical drama aspect.  I found myself ignoring each shows plotlines and instead focusing on the subtext.  It's still better than the ones before and does setup all the levity for season 4.

I thought that Dr. House was worthy of every award becoming a great actor on TV.  He I like.
But for myself it is a real shame that the focus did not stay on Dr. House but more and more upon propaganda.
I like to think for myself.  I do not like others trying to tell me by showing me how I am supposed to think.  That is what appalls me and which ruined it for Dr. House who was great.
I do not recommend this season.  Of course this view is purely subjective and to be taken with a grain of salt.",1402531200,,551,3.849557522123894

I have enjoyed every single season of House, but in terms of the early seasons, I feel like Season 3 is my favorite because this is where you see Hugh Laurie's character hit its stride. His feelings for Cuddy are revealed, the depth of his pain and addiction are revealed as well.  One of my favorite episodes is ""Son of Coma Guy"" because you get to hear why it is House became a doctor-- when it's quite clear he HATES ALL OF US! :)",1395619200,,509,4.02970297029703

2863357,5,B000R9YLKY,"Without a doubt, the best medical drama ever on television, or even on film.  It skillfully combines precision and unusual diagnostic medicine with the Human Equation.  Other medical shows typically neglect the medical aspect, and focus on the soap opera love interests of the hospital staff; but House delivers Medical School level academics, along with the drama seen in only the best of literature - the unexpected, realistic, and non-linear events we all have in our lives, rather than the mundane writing of hacks who are pandering to what the TV executives think will sell the products of their advertisers.  House is tantamount to The Sopranos, in its approach and methodology, and the true swings from the gritty to anguish and from transient humor back to despair, rarely - if ever - seen in the media, yet ever present in the daily reality of life.  House makes the so-called Reality Shows look stupider and more contrived than they actually are.  House hinges somewhere between a documentary and a true masterpiece of the art of film.  This is not a must see, or a summer blockbuster, but a treasure that will reside in the archives of the consciousness of all who embrace it.",1385683200,2,1187,4.851485148514851

2863359,5,B000R9YLKY,"House Season Three, 2006-07

These stories are set in the Princeton Plainsboro Teaching Hospital in New Jersey. Gregory House MD is modeled after Sherlock Holmes, a character who is more observant and knowledgeable than his co workers. The camera records events like Dr. Watson. Everybody lies is Houses slogan. House acts and does what he wishes (as if he owned this business). Would his temper tantrums work in the real world? Would his pill popping be overlooked? [A nurse once told me she hated this show because it was so false to what she saw in her workplace. I told her Hollywood makes drama and entertainment, fictional reality.] This show has a very high amount of drama and personal conflicts. Is that its attraction? There is a recurring plot. A patient arrives at a hospital. There are conflicts about the diagnosis. Finally Dr. House correctly diagnoses the problem and the cure.

This show, like some foods, is best taken in small doses. This show is not a substitute for seeing a doctor for any problem. The important lesson here is that a problem cannot be solved until it is correctly diagnosed. Think of that when you read opinions in the newspapers or hear opinions on radio or television. Do they really know what they're talking about? Or are they just putting out lies or half truths to promote an agenda for which they are being paid? How many people die yearly from a mistake in their prescriptions? How many people die each year from a medical mistake?

Here are the names of the twenty four episodes on the five single-sided DVDs.
Disc 1: Meaning; Cain and Able; Informed Consent; Lines in the Sand;Fools for Love.
Disc 2: Que Sera Sera; Son of Coma Guy; Whac A Mole;Finding Judas; Merry Little Christmas.
Disc 3: Words and Deeds; One Day, One Room;Needle in a Haystack; Insensitive; Half Wit.
Disc 4: Top Secret; Fetal Position; Airborne; Act Your Age; House Training.
Disc 5: Family; Resignation; The Jerk; Human Error.",1384732800,,1948,4.791666666666667
2863360,2,B000R9YLKY,"Too unrealistic. A dr. could never talk to patients like this guy does. And he is a complete jerk and is honored for it and gets away with everything and gets what he wants always. Other people take the blame for his awful actions. Nice message to send to our society, esp. our youth! How terrible!",1384387200,,298,4.339285714285714
2863361,5,B000R9YLKY,House is again amazing.  By the end of this season House loses his entire team we have grown to know and love.,1384300800,,110,4.0
2863362,4,B000R9YLKY,"House is a good show, if not great. The acting by Laurie, Edelstein (Cuddy)and Sean Leonard (Wilson) is nothing short of terrific but the rest of the cast leaves a bit to be desired (In the case of the actors that play Foremen and Chase, A LOT to be desired) however, the show relies heavily on a formula and many could tire of it. If you know anything about the show and don't think you'll like it you probably won't. It's not dynamic or surprising, its vehicle for Laurie's greatness and those of us cynical at heart who can appreciate the risks the show's creators took by making House's namesake so selfish and caustic.",1382918400,,623,4.473684210526316
2863363,5,B000R9YLKY,"I see some problems in continuity, one being in ""Birthmarks"" we learn House and Wilson meet soon after Wilson graduates med school, making him an intern. In an earlier episode, ""Knight Fall,"" when Wilson is talking to the first former Mrs Wilson, Sam, he mentions them being together while he was in his residency. However, at the conference he meets House at, Wilson's carrying a package containing his divorce papers. Also, in the most excellent episodes ""House's Head"" and ""Wilson's Heart"" (Season four enders), House states he sees some dangerous symptoms prior to the bus crash. Actually, all he sees is Amber taking flu medication. Her kidneys weren't messed up until after the crash, but House insists he saw something prior. OK, those two obvious things bothering me, IMO ""House, MD"" never ever jumped the shark. Sure, some episodes are better than others but none has that wretched, turning the corner to bad ""moment."" As for the medical issues, here is my big, major gripe about the show: there are so many HIPAA violations it's not even funny, unless we can assume medical releases were signed by just about anyone involved. One glaring example is Edward Vogler (hisssssss)coming in and picking up a patient's chart, like he has any business doing so. Not even another doctor can do that unless that doctor has some role in the patient's care. One good example of observing HIPAA, however, is when Cuddy goes to look at a person's chart and House moves the screen away from her because it's none of her business. Google HIPAA to learn more. The government takes this law very seriously. I work for a medical health system and we take it seriously too.

One more great comment: Robert Sean Leonard. He was very young, early 20s, when he played a major role in Kenneth Branagh's ""Much Ado about Nothing,"" and some time between that movie and ""House, MD"" his acting greatly improved. I've read reviews that he should've won an Emmy for the House's Head/Wilson's Heart episodes. He does an amazing job.

As for getting these eps via Amazon Instant Video, I mostly don't have a problem, except in the connection. In ""House's Head"" it kept jamming at the same part of the video till I got so desperate I downloaded all of the episodes I'd bought.",1381190400,,2251,4.784061696658098

2863403,4,B000R9YLKY,"I still gave the season a 4 star because the actors are quite good and the production quality is great but I feel it is a problem with the format of the show.  Designed as a show with a mystery disease in every episode, the disease must last and not be resolved unit the end of the episode, and there must always be a crisis at some point midway through the episode.  Character development is designed as a distraction from the main disease, mystery storyline.  It inches slowly through the season like a slug.  This season the fellows are supposed to leave because they leave in real life after 2 years, but instead of ending their learning and moving on, one must be fired and the other two quit.  And the sexual innuendo focuses on Cuddy this year.  While I felt it didn't matter in the first two seasons, the format was getting old for me in this season.  The answer for me wasn't ditching 3 cast members but making it a more character driven show.  To me, it seems that network television has feared character driven shows and gone for something that doesn't matter how closely they are viewed and aimed toward shallow stories that don't matter from one episode to the next.  House is much better than most network shows but suffers from the same format.  While I still have affection for it, the format isn't something that really keeps it in my mind.  Love the main character but he needs something more to go on.",1353888000,,1420,4.465116279069767

The dialog is engaging and intelligent and sometimes seems dry. Yet this episode as a whole is one of the most emotionally moving episodes in the entire series. While many ideas are discussed perhaps the most interesting is the way the story deals with issues around ""trust"". Why do we trust? Who do we trust when we need - really need - to figure out what's true? This story doesn't pretend to answer these questions (or any questions) for everyone. One's left with the sense that the answer may be different for each of us at different times in our lives.

2863417,5,B000R9YLKY,"What can be said about a series that must certainly be ranked as one of the most compelling to have ever appeared on television? It is easy to view the slew of awards that House, M.D. has been nominated for (and won), to recall the litany of accolades the show has garnered from news, entertainment, and magazine critics, and even to review the endless series of online postings concerning the show (like this very one, here, on Amazon), and conclude that, ""Yes, House, M.D. is probably a good show."" But in fact, House, M.D. is more than a good show. For many viewers, the series is easily one of the most fascinating and unusual to have ever been aired on television. Moreover, and dare I say it, the series will likely eventually be ranked amongst the top television shows ever produced on network television.

But before I say any more about House, MD., let me briefly for the reader summarize the show. House, M.D. is a medical drama that takes place at a fictional teaching hospital (""Princeton-Plainsborough Hospital""). The story revolves around a particular doctor, Dr. Gregory House, an individual who has established himself as a medical genius able to solve difficult medical mysteries that other doctors have been unable to solve. Dr. House works with a small group of internists who are serving in residence under him, and who, despite their much less experience, actively work with House to solve medical problems through a technique called a ""Differential Diagnosis,"" a kind of group-based brainstorming session where diagnostic ideas are presented, written on a white board, and systematically eliminated by comparing each hypothesis with the ongoing list of patient symptoms. But Dr. House is more than just a diagnostic genius: he possesses a debilitating leg injury that keeps him in perpetual pain, and he regularly uses powerful prescription painkillers to the point where there is genuine concern that he may, in fact, be a pain medicine addict. But there's more. Along with his genius, House has an incredibly insensitive and offensive demeanor, and seemingly has no concern for social norms, courtesies, or sometimes, even common decency. His unparalleled genius at helping patients is probably what keeps him employed in spite of his incredibly ongoing offensive behavior.

What makes this show so compelling, so unique, and so interesting? There is probably no one answer to this question. At the core of it is likely House himself, a character who is fundamentally a contradiction, a walking incongruity, a person that we desperately and increasingly wish to understand, and perhaps, even wish to control to correct his unacceptable behavior. We find ourselves watching this man and so strongly wishing that we can figure him out, to come to a true understanding and belief about him, to solve the mystery of who he really is, and by that knowledge, settle the manifold open questions surrounding him and his relationships to others that each episode more fully presents.

Unfortunately, or should I rather say, ""fortunately,"" such an understanding is not easily developed. The complexities, ambiguities, and open questions surrounding the character of House come tantalizingly close to being solved time after time, only to be later shown that what we thought was the answer to this man was really just another false lead, another misunderstanding, another fact to add into this increasingly difficult puzzle. Part of the show's allure is this ongoing dissonance, not only between House and his coworkers, but deeply within House himself. Is he truly an uncaring person? Is he truly a person who views his entire medical career as simply a series of puzzles to be solved, and where people who recover are simply a side effect of the solved puzzle? Does he really look at every social, religious, or ethnic factor as a legitimate target of derision? Is he truly hostile to people's religious convictions? Does he truly believe that his drug addiction is an irrelevant issue to his work? Each episode faces us with House's reaction to these questions to varying degrees, and over time, we may find that we build an increasing understanding of this man, but we often find those understandings torn apart in a later episode, where new observations on House make us rethink what we think we knew.

In spite of House's problems and deficiencies, we often find him an imminently likeable character, and we often see hints of goodness in him that he desperately tries to keep hidden from others. Often, it is hinted in the subtilest of ways that House himself wishes to hide from others the fact that he truly does care, but this hint is just as quickly dashed as we witness his next immature toy kicking. (It can sometimes seem that House is more of a four year old in a nursery who is testing his fellow nursery members for territorial markers. In other cases, he is the genius child who seeks to use others as fodder for his most recent theories on human and animal behavior.)

House, M.D., if the truth be known, does not start out in Season One as a soap opera, but by Season Five for the series run, I think a defensible case can be made that the show takes on many of the trappings of a soap opera, curiously and ironically enough, mirroring the very soap operas that the character House in the show is seen so frequently watching (often, on an old, 1990's style portable television located in his office). This morphing into the arena of the soap opera doesn't really matter, though, for the viewer who has gone through the entire set of previous episodes in order. With no attempt to defend this shift in style, the show uses its first three seasons to genuinely establish itself as a puzzle solving, medical mystery show, with House serving as a medical Sherlock Holmes (sans the hat and the pipe, but plus the strange personality and temperament issues), and the stories are easily carried with each individual episode standing as a mental gymnastic exercise that keeps the viewer wanting more. But strewn through these episodes are myriads of strange, and often, very awkward character interactions that are left unfinished and unexplored, tantalizing us with seeming keys to unlock the mystery of House. It is perhaps inevitable that a show lasting so many years (now in its sixth season) and having such strong characters and unusual trappings would be inevitably drawn to revisit and examine such unfinished business. These ""explorations"" begin to occur more repeatedly in Season Four, and by Season Five, we see the exaggeration of much of this at the expense of series' original, focal point of medical mysteries to be resolved, which by this point in the series often take back seat to the ever growing personal dramas. But even this doesn't matter. The issues and themes explored in Season Five, while taking on the feeling of a soap opera, are still handled with great expertise and generally fascinating ways, so that we still find ourselves focused on each event, all the time still (unconsciously at times, I must admit) wishing that we can figure House out, get the mystery of House solved, and have some type of a resolution that fits our conception of the real world. By the end of Season Five, we still do not have an answer for this dilemma, and the show uses this dilemma to hold the audience's attention in a powerful manner.

The basic premise of the show is so startling unique and fascinating in its own right that the show does not need to rely on cheap ""shock"" tricks to maintain attention. It is true that there are a number of ""shocking"" events to occur through the series, and there can be no doubt that the show, being first and foremost a network based television format production, employs ""cliffhangers"" to hold the viewer through the regular commercial breaks, but it is amazing to see how the show is regularly worked into individual episodes that are artfully crafted into stories that flow, and work, from beginning to end.

Quite some time ago, I wrote a long review for The Rockford Files, a television show in the 1970's that, in my own thinking, achieved the status as being one of the best television shows ever produced. I had written my review at a time when the first Rockford Files DVD's were being released, and the opportunity to re-watch these shows reminded me again of the superior writing, the acting, and the impressive interworking of the cast which made this show, not just a cut above the average television show, but a true classic, one that could almost not be challenged in the realm of television. I still feel that way about The Rockford Files, and, truth be known, another very different show from a decade earlier, The Dick Van Dyke Show, had many of these same characteristics, all coalescing to make what eventual became in both cases a classic production. The Rockford Files and The Dick Van Dyke Show reached such pinnacles of performance that they remain examples of the very best television ever made, and even the ravages of 30 and 40 years of time have done little but solidify that achievement.

House, M.D. is, in my opinion, is likely destined for that same level of accolade. In the show, we find that same coalescing of features - a truly unique character creation, excellent writing, and a cast that works well together - that will argue for the show's inclusion in that highest level of ranking. But whether that specific claim turns out to be true or not, the fact remains that House, M.D. is one of the most fascinating, intriguing, and enjoyable shows to watch. We witness medical problems and the difficult procedure in diagnosing and treating those problems; we witness the struggles, oddities, and offensiveness (and yes, there are many parts of the show that are incredibly offensive) of a main character who remains both a genius and an enigma, an inscrutable person who is endlessly fascinating to behold; we witness a cast of actors who must earn to interact with the powerful character of House while establishing their own credibility; and finally, but not least of all, we enjoy Hugh Laurie's incredible rendition of the House character. Add these factors up, and you end up with one heck of a fascinating show. I'll say it in conclusion again, that this is one of the best television shows to have appeared in years, and Hugh Laurie is superb in his role as House. You can enjoy it even more on DVD, where there are no commercial interruptions. I rate this as five stars, but the real truth is that it is one BIG star (House) with four other stars with him. Well, make that seven or eight other stars, depending on the season you are currently watching.",1326067200,,10674,4.848135964912281

Ever since ""Battlestar Galactica"" ended its series run on SiFi, Kenny didn't know what to watch on Friday nights anymore. Then one late Saturday night, he came across some reruns of ""House"" on Bravo.  From then on, Kenny was hooked on Hugh Laurie and the show. A few months later Kenny purchased the first two seasons of the show from Amazon.com, and I purchased seasons three and four for his birthday.  He dosen't know but I have seasons five and six on my Amazon.com Wish List ready to include in my Christmas shopping.

My thanks to Amazon.com for making the first six seasons of ""House"" available for purchase. I also want to say an affectionate ""thank you"" to Hugh Laurie, his fellow cast members, the show's directors and producers, and everyone else associated with the show who gets up with the birds and puts in the incredibly long hours to help make ""House"" so very special.

2863435,5,B000R9YLKY,"What can be said about a series that must certainly be ranked as one of the most compelling to have ever appeared on television? It is easy to view the slew of awards that House, M.D. has been nominated for (and won), to recall the litany of accolades the show has garnered from news, entertainment, and magazine critics, and even to review the endless series of online postings concerning the show (like this very one, here, on Amazon), and conclude that, ""Yes, House, M.D. is probably a good show."" But in fact, House, M.D. is more than a good show. For many viewers, the series is easily one of the most fascinating and unusual to have ever been aired on television. Moreover, and dare I say it, the series will likely eventually be ranked amongst the top television shows ever produced on network television.

But before I say any more about House, MD., let me briefly for the reader summarize the show. House, M.D. is a medical drama that takes place at a fictional teaching hospital (""Princeton-Plainsborough Hospital""). The story revolves around a particular doctor, Dr. Gregory House, an individual who has established himself as a medical genius able to solve difficult medical mysteries that other doctors have been unable to solve. Dr. House works with a small group of internists who are serving in residence under him, and who, despite their much less experience, actively work with House to solve medical problems through a technique called a ""Differential Diagnosis,"" a kind of group-based brainstorming session where diagnostic ideas are presented, written on a white board, and systematically eliminated by comparing each hypothesis with the ongoing list of patient symptoms. But Dr. House is more than just a diagnostic genius: he possesses a debilitating leg injury that keeps him in perpetual pain, and he regularly uses powerful prescription painkillers to the point where there is genuine concern that he may, in fact, be a pain medicine addict. But there's more. Along with his genius, House has an incredibly insensitive and offensive demeanor, and seemingly has no concern for social norms, courtesies, or sometimes, even common decency. His unparalleled genius at helping patients is probably what keeps him employed in spite of his incredibly ongoing offensive behavior.

What makes this show so compelling, so unique, and so interesting? There is probably no one answer to this question. At the core of it is likely House himself, a character who is fundamentally a contradiction, a walking incongruity, a person that we desperately and increasingly wish to understand, and perhaps, even wish to control to correct his unacceptable behavior. We find ourselves watching this man and so strongly wishing that we can figure him out, to come to a true understanding and belief about him, to solve the mystery of who he really is, and by that knowledge, settle the manifold open questions surrounding him and his relationships to others that each episode more fully presents.

Unfortunately, or should I rather say, ""fortunately,"" such an understanding is not easily developed. The complexities, ambiguities, and open questions surrounding the character of House come tantalizingly close to being solved time after time, only to be later shown that what we thought was the answer to this man was really just another false lead, another misunderstanding, another fact to add into this increasingly difficult puzzle. Part of the show's allure is this ongoing dissonance, not only between House and his coworkers, but deeply within House himself. Is he truly an uncaring person? Is he truly a person who views his entire medical career as simply a series of puzzles to be solved, and where people who recover are simply a side effect of the solved puzzle? Does he really look at every social, religious, or ethnic factor as a legitimate target of derision? Is he truly hostile to people's religious convictions? Does he truly believe that his drug addiction is an irrelevant issue to his work? Each episode faces us with House's reaction to these questions to varying degrees, and over time, we may find that we build an increasing understanding of this man, but we often find those understandings torn apart in a later episode, where new observations on House make us rethink what we think we knew.

In spite of House's problems and deficiencies, we often find him an imminently likeable character, and we often see hints of goodness in him that he desperately tries to keep hidden from others. Often, it is hinted in the subtilest of ways that House himself wishes to hide from others the fact that he truly does care, but this hint is just as quickly dashed as we witness his next immature toy kicking. (It can sometimes seem that House is more of a four year old in a nursery who is testing his fellow nursery members for territorial markers. In other cases, he is the genius child who seeks to use others as fodder for his most recent theories on human and animal behavior.)

House, M.D., if the truth be known, does not start out in Season One as a soap opera, but by Season Five for the series run, I think a defensible case can be made that the show takes on many of the trappings of a soap opera, curiously and ironically enough, mirroring the very soap operas that the character House in the show is seen so frequently watching (often, on an old, 1990's style portable television located in his office). This morphing into the arena of the soap opera doesn't really matter, though, for the viewer who has gone through the entire set of previous episodes in order. With no attempt to defend this shift in style, the show uses its first three seasons to genuinely establish itself as a puzzle solving, medical mystery show, with House serving as a medical Sherlock Holmes (sans the hat and the pipe, but plus the strange personality and temperament issues), and the stories are easily carried with each individual episode standing as a mental gymnastic exercise that keeps the viewer wanting more. But strewn through these episodes are myriads of strange, and often, very awkward character interactions that are left unfinished and unexplored, tantalizing us with seeming keys to unlock the mystery of House. It is perhaps inevitable that a show lasting so many years (now in its sixth season) and having such strong characters and unusual trappings would be inevitably drawn to revisit and examine such unfinished business. These ""explorations"" begin to occur more repeatedly in Season Four, and by Season Five, we see the exaggeration of much of this at the expense of series' original, focal point of medical mysteries to be resolved, which by this point in the series  often take back seat to the ever growing personal dramas. But even this doesn't matter. The issues and themes explored in Season Five, while taking on the feeling of a soap opera, are still handled with great expertise and generally fascinating ways, so that we still find ourselves focused on each event, all the time still (unconsciously at times, I must admit) wishing that we can figure House out, get the mystery of House solved, and have some type of a resolution that fits our conception of the real world. By the end of Season Five, we still do not have an answer for this dilemma, and the show uses this dilemma to hold the audience's attention in a powerful manner.

The basic premise of the show is so startling unique and fascinating in its own right that the show does not need to rely on cheap ""shock"" tricks to maintain attention. It is true that there are a number of ""shocking"" events to occur through the series, and there can be no doubt that the show, being first and foremost a network based television format production, employs  ""cliffhangers"" to hold the viewer through the regular commercial breaks, but it is amazing to see how the show is regularly worked into individual episodes that are artfully crafted into stories that flow, and work, from beginning to end.

Quite some time ago, I wrote a long review for The Rockford Files, a television show in the 1970's that, in my own thinking, achieved the status as being one of the best television shows ever produced. I had written my review at a time when the first Rockford Files DVD's were being released, and the opportunity to re-watch these shows reminded me again of the superior writing, the acting, and the impressive interworking of the cast which made this show, not just a cut above the average television show, but a true classic, one that could almost not be challenged in the realm of television. I still feel that way about The Rockford Files, and, truth be known, another very different show from a decade earlier, The Dick Van Dyke Show, had many of these same characteristics, all coalescing to make what eventual became in both cases a classic production. The Rockford Files and The Dick Van Dyke Show reached such pinnacles of performance that they remain examples of the very best television ever made, and even the ravages of 30 and 40 years of time have done little but solidify that achievement.

House, M.D. is, in my opinion, is likely destined for that same level of accolade. In the show, we find that same coalescing of features - a truly unique character creation, excellent writing, and a cast that works well together - that will argue for the show's inclusion in that highest level of ranking. But whether that specific claim turns out to be true or not, the fact remains that House, M.D. is one of the most fascinating, intriguing, and enjoyable shows to watch. We witness medical problems and the difficult procedure in diagnosing and treating those problems; we witness the struggles, oddities, and offensiveness (and yes, there are many parts of the show that are incredibly offensive) of a main character who remains both a genius and an enigma, an inscrutable person who is endlessly fascinating to behold; we witness a cast of actors who must earn to interact with the powerful character of House while establishing their own credibility; and finally, but not least of all, we enjoy Hugh Laurie's incredible rendition of the House character. Add these factors up, and you end up with one heck of a fascinating show. I'll say it in conclusion again, that this is one of the best television shows to have appeared in years, and Hugh Laurie is superb in his role as House. You can enjoy it even more on DVD, where there are no commercial interruptions. I rate this as five stars, but the real truth is that it is one BIG star (House) with four other stars with him. Well, make that seven or eight other stars, depending on the season you are currently watching.",1266969600,4,10676,4.848135964912281

Hugh Laurie, Jennifer Morrison, Jesse Spencer, Omar Epps, Lisa Edelstein, Robert Sean Leonard, and the rest of this EXTRAORDINARY cast, have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least. All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)! Very well written and very well presented, the series is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few laughs and tears. House, M.D. does a great job of describing people's different personalities, fears, and the problems they face. It is all about life, death, human relations, hope, pain, and inner strength.
The acting, the setting, the plot (and subplots), the dialogues, and the music (!), which are just wonderful! It is indeed a rarity when an amazing series such as this comes by.

2863447,5,B000R9YLKY,"In Season 3 the characters are developed a lot more to the point that you change a lot of your original opinions from seasons 1 and 2.  There is a side story which runs for House over several episodes encompassing some quite dramatic scenes.  House reveals more about his past, his vulnerability and his own psyche and all those around House have their loyalty, morality and duality tested to the extreme.  Although there is still a case to solve each week as well as the side plot, the downside is that House is not in Clinic much for about 6 episodes.  This has always been one of my favourtie parts and where I find most of the comic relief.  Later in the season there is one of the most beautiful miracles of medical science built in to a case.  It involves an unborn baby and like all the other story lines it really did happen.  This season experiments a bit more with different settings and a lot more layering of the relationships and personalities.  However, House (Hugh Laurie and writers et all) are simply brilliant as always and I enjoyed his rapier, cutting wit once again.

2863449,5,B000R9YLKY,"I was late in coming to ""House"", as I'm not much of a fan of medical shows or contemporary procedurals, and these were the angles most emphasized by the early ads. Still, some family members were big into the show for years, and they finally wore me down this past summer. Now that I've watched every episode at least once . . . well, I'm still not much of a fan of medical shows, but it turns out that the medical mysteries are only a small part of the appeal, and work mainly to give a focus for the character- and humor-driven material. Yes, ""House"" is a medical drama, and it's every bit as formulaic as it appeared. Still, this is one of the most intelligently written, not to mention funniest, shows on TV, and they inevitably find ways to color this template in surprising and even moving ways.

Though the first three seasons of House are very similar, Season 3 is probably the strongest of them, now that the characters are fully developed and the individual performances finely honed. At the heart of the show is Hugh Laurie's House, and so much has been written in praise of him that it's hard to add anything else without delving into clich. Simply put, he's one of the most entertaining, fascinating figures you'll find in a TV show. I view him as something of a nerd icon: though we nerds are generally not geniuses nor are we necessarily interested in medicine, House provides an extreme version of the nerd personality: someone who is more interested in things and abstract ideas than in the people surrounding him, and who doesn't have patience for superficial social graces. Even better, House is, indeed, a genius and possesses an incredibly caustic wit, two other traits any self-respecting nerd must long for. (He also finds hot women inexplicably drawn to him from time to time, which, while not terribly plausible, also fulfills obvious nerd wish fulfillment.)

House is no mere one man show, however. The far more human and empathetic oncologist Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) is House's best friend and foil, and it's to the show's credit that he proves as intriguing as House, despite displaying a radically different personality. Beyond them we have Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein), the dean of medicine and House's nemesis/secret love interest, and House's three younger fellows, Foreman (Omar Epps), Cameron (Jennifer Morrison) and Chase (Jesse Spencer). Cuddy initially functions primarily as a sparring partner for House, but here she's given greater depth, particularly in her attempts to become a mother. One relative weakness of the show is the slight thinness of House's fellows (a fact well-illustrated in Airborne: ""You disagree with everything I say, you agree with everything I say, you be morally outraged by everything I do."") Still, Epps, Morrison and Spencer give considered and nuanced performances that bring the sometimes underwritten figures to life. Chase is probably the most conventionally likable of them, and serves as a much more handsome stand-in for the nerd audience i.e. he admires House and wants to be like him/impress him. (Also, Chase's fabulous hair and powerful jaw has been known to give even the most staunchly heterosexual of male viewers a slight case of the vapours. I can only imagine what he does to women. . .) Foreman is harder to like, though he's probably the most complicated of the fellows; he's a former delinquent kid from the street who is endlessly determined to be the best, but fears the moral compromises and inhumanity sometimes necessary to get the job done. Finally we have the controversial Cameron, the quintessentially caring and emotional (not to mention gorgeous) female doctor who becomes to personally involved all too often. Lots of people (women) dislike her (bitter old hags, no doubt), but she's ultimately a necessary figure, since she provides the polar opposite of House, even more so than Wilson does. (This matters cause it's quite a philosophical show, and must represent a wide cross-section of viewpoints.) Anyway, regardless of what others think _I_ like her. (In fact, I like her more than it is either rational or wise to like a fictional character. . .)

Since the show is so driven by dialogue and character, the individual episodes don't necessarily stand out as much as they would in more plot-driven shows. Still, there are more than a few particularly noteworthy efforts. ""One Day, One Room"" is probably the best episode of the season, a non-formula one where House is coerced into counseling a rape victim. This is a particularly philosophical episode, which I always like, and I'm impressed by how, despite being a generally misanthropic show, ""House"" manages to give a fair hearing for less bleak worldviews. ""Insensitive"" is another strong one, largely due to the comic subplot where House repeatedly disrupts Cuddy's date. (Possibly House's best line ever: (to Cuddy's date) ""You must've meet online . . . that or else you have a friend who secretly hates you."") There's also ""Son of a Coma Guy,"" where House awakens a vegetative patient (brilliantly played by John Larroquette) to help cure his dying son. (At its best, House is a great mixture of humor and pathos, and few episodes do that better than ""Son of. . ."") On the downside, the season has a rather humdrum finale, particularly when compared to the conclusions. Still, this is partially redeemed by the excellent multi-episode plot arc where the vengeful Det. Tritter (David Morse) tries to bring House down on drug charges. Morse gives a great turn as Tritter, who proves ever bit as obsessive and driven as House, and the general events does much to strain House's other relations, which is, again, always the heart of the show.

""House"" underwent a somewhat substantial revamping after this season and, as much as I enjoy Season 3, this probably isn't a bad thing. While the last season and a half haven't been quite as good as the strongest earlier material, they managed to preemptively stave off any staleness that would've emerged sooner or later. Whatever the case, the material we have is very good, and anyone who is interested in a funny, intelligent but surprisingly human show would be wise to check this out. (Though you should start at the beginning, of course.)",1232236800,2,6246,4.928774928774929

2863474,5,B000R9YLKY,"Season 1 got me hooked, Season 2 made me fall in love and Season 3 just made me giddy. If someone told me this show couldn't get better, I would be inclined to agree. At the end of Season 2, House was shot and he asked to be given Ketamine which would help fix his leg. Season 3 starts off with, what seems to be a completely new House, he's happy and he's walking without an aid and doing his job without Vicodin. This is cool, it shows us just how much the leg problems have affected House and his personality. It doesn't last, as within a few episodes he's back to using the Cane and popping pills every hour.

During mid season House also gains himself a Vogler-esque type enemy, only this time it's a cop, and it lands House in some serious trouble. He's constantly haunted by this cop who insists on making House's life a misery until he's behind bars. House just carries on as usual, so the cop known as Tritter starts on his friends, first off is Wilson. This is a big test for their friendship as Wilson's life is almost destroyed by Tritter, but he refuses to give him up. Can we say the same for the team? Even Chase? Watch it and find out, you won't be disappointed.

Naturally Season 3 is bound to have the classic lines. Below are some of my favourites.

Cameron: ""You're lucky he didn't die.""
House: ""I'm lucky? He's the one who didn't die.""

From Episode 8: Whac-A-Mole

House: ""Okay, fine. I'll father your child. But first you gotta write me a Vicodin prescription. Just so I can get through the foreplay.""

From Episode 14: Insensitive

House: ""I was curious. Since I'm not a cat, that's not dangerous.""

It's not surprising that House has its ups and downs but the cast always manages to save the show.  For me this is the essence of what makes a show worth watching.  Even when the writing lets you down the actors make it watchable.  By now we know Dr. HOuse and his attitude.  We also know that at the last minute he will come up with an impossible diagnosis and save the patient.  The Cuddy/Wilson interaction is what drives the show.  House's underlings may or may not be interesting, but the core cast keeps this above the fray.",1211241600,,692,4.488
2863481,5,B000R9YLKY,"The Season 3 DVD collection of House, M.D. has been out for nearly two months, and I've already watched it so many times that even my husband (who's not really a fan) can quote chapter and verse and tell you, from one line of dialogue, which episode I'm watching (yet again!)  So it goes without saying that I highly recommend that you go out and purchase this set (in the lovely red box) to match the blue (Season 1) and orange (Season 2) collections, if you haven't already.

My suggestion is to watch the seasons and the episodes in order.  Although House, M.D. is promoted as a procedural drama, the episodes also tell the fascinating story of Dr. Gregory House and the doctors who reside in his orbit.  The Season 3 DVD set contains a hilarious blooper reel (my only complaint about it is that it is too short); a director's commentary on the mid-season episode ""Half-Wit"" (which guest starred Dave Matthews); and a behind-the-scenes look at ""The Jerk"" (a late season entry).  Other extras include a look at the props, a peek at the production office, and some alternate takes of several scenes. (None of these additional extras, in my opinion, is particularly special).

My favorite extra on the DVD has less to do with the show than with its star.  It is a recorded recording session of Hugh Laurie's band ""Band From TV"" recording Laurie's arrangement of ""Minnie the Moocher.""  It's a rare look into the recording studio and into Hugh Laurie's other life (one of them, anyway) as a gifted musician.

The advantage to watching Season 3 on DVD, besides the glorious color and richness of the print, is that you can watch episodes one after the other with no breaks, no commercials, nothing to interrupt the flow of the narrative. Broken up as it is aired, it is easy to miss the cohesiveness and story arc of Season 3.  As I see it, the season unfolds in four separate acts (on five DVDs).  Act 1: Episodes 1-4 (concluding with ""Lines in the Sand""), followed by the bridging episode ""Fools for Love.""  Act 2 (also known as the ""Tritter Arc"" among fans was) was bridged into Act 3 with ""One Day One Room,"" which concluded with ""Fetal Position."" ""Airborne"" led fans into the season's final act.  The following ""road map"" is intended to guide you through some of the glorious subtext and motivations (as I saw them) that suffused the series's third season.  These are the things that can be easily missed in casual viewing, but that draw me back to this show week after week and viewing after viewing.

Act I--The Happiness Scale. The season started out hopefully for Dr. House, in the aftermath of his near-fatal shooting and subsequent treatment with the veterinary drug ketamine, a radical procedure that would, if it worked, end House's pain to the point where he could exercise, do physical therapy, and regain the use of his leg. Side note:  This is why you should also watch Season 2 before Season 3. We first meet the new (and maybe improved) Season 3 House all sweaty and running!  Pain free and cane-free! However, House's Season 2 finale hallucination had convinced him that ""meaning"" was lacking in his miserable, lonely existence.  And Season 3, as much as anything, is about House's search for meaning and humanity - and for healing.  House's Season 3 journey is also about change--change that is within his control, and change that is not.

But from the start, House is at a loss as to how to insert meaning into his life.  So much of season 3 is about things that House cannot control, such as the terrible disappointment of the ketamine treatment's failure.  There is a devastating scene in Episode 3 (""Cane and Able"") where House tries to push himself on a treadmill in the dead of night.  He's in terrible pain, desperate, trying to deny the pain its final victory.  Then there is the tragedy of that episode's final scene, made even more tragic by the musical backdrop of the song ""Gravity,"" as House seeks out the familiarity of his cane, his face awash with defeat.

Season 3, Act I concludes with ""Lines in the Sand,"" as House tries to understand how parents could devote themselves to an autistic child.  As he had wondered about the patient's wife in the season premiere, so, too, he wonders how the boy's parents can be fulfilled by the all-consuming task of raising their needy son.  What is the meaning they derive from it?  Are they happy?  House connects with the autistic boy, and for his efforts is rewarded with a gift that I think both stuns and moves him.  It is also in this episode that House engages in what appears to be a power struggle with the Dean of Medicine, Lisa Cuddy (who alternately tries to both control and protect Dr. House), over something seemingly trivial - the replacement of House's bloodstained carpet - that actually gets to the heart of House's control issues.  That carpet was something he could control when everything else in his life was spiraling away from him.  It had become, in effect, his anchor.  He doesn't want it replaced.

Act II--Les Miserables. As Act II unfolds, things spiral completely out of House's control.  He offends the wrong patient, a vindictive detective who sees House's relationship with vicodin as a menace to society.  House has found his own personal Javert.  He sees Detective Michael Tritter (played by David Morse) simply as a bully.  If you ignore a bully, House postulates, he will go away to harass an easier score.  House's refusal to deal with Tritter as a serious threat digs him into even deeper trouble, sweeping everyone around him into the maelstrom. But through this personal nightmare, House still endeavors to come to terms with the role of ""meaning"" in his life and in others'.

The episodes ""Son of Coma Guy"" and ""Merry Little Christmas"" are specific examples of House's continued journey.  In ""Son of Coma Guy,"" House helps a man (played by John Laroquette) make sense of his own tragedy by enabling the man to make the ultimate sacrifice. It's a poignant moment, driven not by ego or the solving a diagnostic riddle, but by respect for one person's desire to make his death meaningful.  House, who is often accused of not caring for anyone but himself and having no interest in a patient beyond solving a diagnostic puzzle, risks his career and his freedom by assisting the man's suicide at a time when, had Detective Tritter found out, it would have ramped up House's legal difficulties exponentially.

The second act of Season 3 also explores the value House places on being ""normal,"" picking up on a thread from ""Lines in the Sand."" House decries being ""inside the circle"" and the ""circle queens,"" who endeavor to re-mold anyone ""outside the circle"" (as House sees himself) to fit inside it.  House appears to revel in his uniqueness, his outsider status a badge of honor.  In ""Son of Coma Guy,"" he romanticizes a Japanese Buraku (outcast) physician he knew as a kid living in Japan as his role model for becoming a doctor himself.

""Merry Little Christmas"" is the first of several episodes where House helps give another outsider--another ""freak"" like him--the chance of a normal life.  And it becomes clearer and clearer that this is something House seeks for himself.  This theme echoes the Season 2 finale, ""No Reason,"" in which House ultimately decides to risk his genius for a ""normal"" life.  The encounter with Tritter (and the nearly tragic events of ""Merry Little Christmas"") lead to House's voluntary stay in a drug rehab program.  But we are led to assume, by House's own words, that neither rehab nor his brush with the law have any effect on the good doctor.

The Tritter arc bridges to Act III with ""One Day One Room,"" which contradicts the assumption that House was left unchanged by his encounter with Detective Tritter.  I think rehab put House in a particularly vulnerable emotional place, despite his best efforts.  And it is at this vulnerable time that Eve, a young rape victim, enters into his sphere.  She simply ""wants to talk""  to House - and only to House.  But he resists connecting with her, questioning why she would even want to connect with him, until he can no longer push back.  And when she wears down his resistance, getting deeply under his skin, House reveals to her that he had been physically (and probably emotionally) abused by his marine pilot father

Although being an abuse survivor doesn't come close to fully explaining House's motivations, personality, or behavior, it does begin to explain why he so very much needs to be in control of his out-of-control life. I believe that he had never told anyone about the abuse until that moment in a room with a stranger. That, of course, is part of House's MO: revealing things about himself to perfect strangers (and to us, the viewers) rather than risk doing so to those who know him the best.

Act III--Baby Steps. After the heaviness of the first two acts, we get the humor of ""Needle in a Haystack"" before embarking once again on House's journey to ""normal.""  We get hints in ""Insensitive"" and ""Half-Wit"" that House is doing a lot of reading about experimental pain management - something to help himself. Wilson believes that House is depressed and needs to begin to reach out to people, rather than relying on drugs and the faint hope of healing himself through radical, experimental, and dangerous procedures.  ""It will shorten your life,"" Wilson tells House in ""Insensitive,"" regarding an experimental treatment for pain.  ""Shorter but normal,"" House retorts.

But in ""Fetal Position,"" we do witness House begin to reach out, take baby steps.  Back in ""One Day One Room"" House had revealed to Wilson (and to the rape victim) that he visits a jogging park (even though he can no longer run) to ""watch and imagine.""  In ""Fetal Position,"" more of his torn inner life is revealed.  House makes plans for a vacation that someone in his physical condition cannot possibly take with ease:  The Galapagos Islands, Vancouver Island, the Andes.  He imagines, he desires.  But to actually do would require bigger steps towards change than he is emotionally able, or willing, to make.

Act IV--Resignation. Season 3's final act is fueled by Foreman's decision that he has no stomach for House's game.  He sees himself in House (I don't, but, hey, I'm only a fan) and doesn't like what he sees: a cold, misanthropic, unemotional machine.  No heart; no soul.  Meanwhile, House continues his baby steps towards change. Whether they are fueled by the antidepressants Wilson was surreptitiously slipping him for at least one or two episodes, who knows? But House allows himself the pleasure of a young woman's company and an ongoing flirtation with Cuddy, something he would have never done two years ago, or even one year ago.  Our change-averse, out of control doctor has edged closer and closer to becoming part of society.

Then, in the finale, House does something we've never seen him do: kick back and relax with a patient's spouse.  The scene towards the end of the episode perfectly bookends the season premiere, in which House had nearly forced himself to spend time with his family, trying awkwardly to access his own humanity.  As he told Wilson, ""I didn't even know how I was supposed act.""  But in the finale, he has, in the end, resolved that issue, as he enjoys tequila and cigars with the patient's husband, keeping watch on the man's recovering wife.

This would not be a review of mine if I didn't make special note of the extraordinary Mr. Hugh Laurie, OBE.  His portrayal of one of the most prickly and difficult characters ever written for network television is breathtaking in every episode.  He is a joy to watch as he deftly tells House's story.  He so completely embodies the character, and is so completely in the moment in every scene, that every episode is simply a master's master class. Three words to conclude: buy it. Today.

2863484,4,B000R9YLKY,"""House, M.D."" series 1 and 2 were possibly the best thing to happen to television drama in ten or so years with it's well defined and well played characters, funny yet serious dialogue, and well written stories, and series 3 is not far behind. But it is behind.

Although the main plot of each episode still is an unsolvable medical case and House still is a jolly, painridden misanthropist, the sub plots plays a larger role in series 3. House is about to land in prison and lose his medical license when he insults a policeman (played excellently by David Morse) who in turn goes out of his way to nail House. The drama and tension between House's underlings also raises to new levels ending the series in a true cliffhanger.

This is all very nice, but I think the sub plots get a little too much attention in series 3 and the drama gets a bit too dramatic. I think they painted themselves in a corner with the ending of series 3, which will be very hard to get out of in a plausible way for series 4.

Series 3 is, however, still seriously good entertainment. Hugh Laurie makes sure of that on his own. It is just not entirely as good as series 1 and 2, is all. But the difference is more akin to an Aston Martin being a better car than a Jaguar. That dosen't mean that the Jag is bad car, does it?

The best thing about House is the way that the entire series shuns political correctness in every way and flies in the face of good taste. Addiction, sexual innuendo, abuse of anyone who dares to come near him and a way of twisting every bad situation to his advantage makes this anti-hero the most enjoyable television character for decades.

In this set House becomes embroiled in a vendetta with a police officer who he insults and leaves in an embarrassing situation. The policeman decides to make an example of House who soon finds his life and indeed that of his associates is made miserable by the policeman who does all he can to have House thrown in jail.

They may not be very realistic, but can happen. For those who think it's an outrageous show and don't like it for the fact that Greg House is a narcissistic bastard. That's no reason to not like the show. This show was not made to be funny or anything like that. It does have its humerous moments, but overall is supposed to be a serious show. House has been through things most people will never go through. Faced with the decision to have his leg removed, have half his leg removed, or have nothing done whatsoever. He chose to have nothing done, but his girlfriend went against his only wishes and broke his trust. He cannot trust anyone anymore because of the fact he was betrayed so long ago. He thinks if he gets close to anyone again and it comes down to another life of death situation, he will be betrayed and have his heart broken yet again. This is my favorite show and I will keep watching it. Overall I would give it 5 stars.

I am in nursing school and the students in my class and I have learned a lot from just watching this show. It is an excellent show to watch to learn how to take a good medical history as well as how to do good patient assessments. Some of the less common medical conditions are portrayed very well on the show. They have very good writters for the show that have a lot of medical knowledge.

The story lines are more in depth as back stories and recurring plots take on as much meaning as the episode's main plot.

Watch the season and enjoy.",1200528000,,320,4.3
2863514,5,B000R9YLKY,"I don't really get a chance to watch much episodic television (when the good stuff is on, I'm either already asleep or have gone out somewhere for the evening) - but being a fan of Hugh Laurie, I knew I would love House. I finally had a chance to watch an episode - while recovering from the flu! - and it confirmed that I HAD to keep watching. I immediately bought all available box sets and set out to watch about three or four episodes a night.

Dr. Gregory House is brilliant and truly does not give a tinker's dam what people think. The things with which he gets away - what he says to his colleagues, patients, and superiors - are a vicarious treat. Who wouldn't want to say a lot of what House acerbically delivers in each and every episode?!

What is so compelling about his character is his total unwillingness to bend, whether it is his methodologies or his opinions. Here is a character that - in any other situation - would be one that you KNOW would be set up to metamorphose in some way; perhaps the ""bully"" becomes a kinder, gentler person by episode's end.

Not the case with House. He is everything contrary to what we perceive to be characteristic of a ""hero""; he's a bitter, Vicodin-addicted misanthrope, whose interest in his patients is solely for the medical puzzle they present. On the rare occasions that he appears to connect with a patient, it is always within HIS own parameters.

But you wouldn't want him to change. That's what keeps him strangely likeable and believable; he's a damaged person (his leg injury is really secondary) and is what he is, take it or leave it. He doesn't actually like many people at all - he won't even meet his own patients unless he absolutely HAS to; even though he's a genius diagnostician, he's horrible at relating to people.

We find ourselves alternately cheering his successful unorthodox actions or aghast at his crude insensitivity, and we keep watching! The medical jargon, while complicated at times, never makes the audience feel left out; explanations are skillfully woven into the dialogue before you have a chance to scratch your head in confusion - and without slowing the pace.

This is a highly recommended medical drama with enough suspense and mystery to keep you involved. But if you haven't seen seasons one and two, you would be missing out on some intense character background and stories.

Differential diagnosis, people! Go!

We finally saw the mean side of House, i think they wanted to see how far they could go till we started to hate the House character and that was really painful to watch, first he refused to say sorry to Tritter then he refused to care about everything Wilson was doing to save him, i really felt sorry for Wilson this season and House also punched Chase in the face and made Cuddy cry just to be mean with her.
Finally when the whole thing ended the show became really terrific again, i really liked the season finale, he got what he deserved... can't wait to watch the season 4.

Hugh Laurie is just the perfect man for the job (at least this job): rap in an north-american accent, fake a limp, be a doctor, be a cranky doctor, be a cranky and very intelligent doctor.

Hugh Laurie brings a depth and breadth to Dr. Gregory House that no other actor could.  Laurie's comedic talents give House charm, complexity, and humor even as the writers put words in the doctor's mouth that might otherwise make him despicable.  Episodes are always complex.  The best of them have a rich, interwoven quality in which every scene builds the central theme.  The underlying issues are truly weighty--well beyond the ""mere"" saving of a patient's life.  Revelations about House's values and character are written and acted with subtlety and freshness.  Hugh Laurie will tire of this role long before his audience will tire of watching him.

S3 is essential if you are looking for continuity and closure to S2, but then it presents with it's own set of challenges for Dr. House and the team. Some say that S3 isn't as good as the first two, but don't let that stop you. I will admit S1 and S2 were when the show was at its best but if you are building a collection, you know you gotta have it.

2863544,5,B000R9YLKY,"House is by far the best television series out there, but I have a quibble with both the writers and Amazon's Plot Synopsis. House is branded a drug addict, showing a woeful lack of understanding of chronic pain and it's treatment these days. Granted, House should not be self-medicating and should be under the care of a certified pain specialist, but I know from personal experience that that anyone in that much pain needs the pain-killers simply to able to function at a normal level. There is no euphoria associated with pain meds when taken to control pain.

So, I would urge Amazon to drop the label drug addict and urge the writers to find another way to deal with House's use of Vicodin, perhaps by showing a more enlightened (and current) view of treating chronic pain. All chronic pain suffers want is to lead as normal a life as possible. That doesn't make us junkies looking for a high.",1194307200,,899,4.61875

Each episode describes the emotional drama and intense medical investigations of the House team of doctors against the clock to get to the roots of a special medical puzzle affecting a patient.

There were a couple of weak story threads--while Detective Trotter's investigation allowed an exploration of House's addiction, the show whitewashed the vicious, often illegal, persecutory actions of the cop.  And the show's writers merely toyed with the relationship between Chase & Cameron--they should have either developed the idea further or dropped it entirely.  But these are minor quibbles.

If you have watched any of the House episodes and enjoyed them, then you will know how fascinating it is to watch the team at work.
House Season Three is full of bends and twists, and imaginative medical ideas which seem out of this world but at the same time are all within the realms of possibility, and addictive to watch.

The chemistry between the characters adds to the interest, and despite House's self destructive life style, and despite his rude and uncaring manor, you just cant help but like him.

2863562,4,B000R9YLKY,"The third year of House, M. D., was as good as the first two, continuing a run of interesting shows about people who are involved with unusual and bizarre medical problems.

The formula is pretty well set in stone by now, any victim falling into the clutches of Greg and his team is worse off than anyone suspected, and is bound to get MUCH worse before, possibly, getting better.

I'm three episodes into the fourth season, and believe there must have been a change in writers, as the newest batch of shows seems to me to have lost or misplaced many of the qualities of character development which compelled me to buy the full first three years of the series.

I recommend this third year season to those who enjoyed the first two years.  Whether the fourth year will meet the same high standards of those previous is yet to be seen.  Literally.",1192233600,,846,4.503267973856209

2863564,5,B000R9YLKY,"Even if you've never seen a single episode of House, chances are you've heard about the cranky doctor that's made this show such a hit...

Played by Hugh Laurie, Dr. Gregory House is a brilliant misanthrope who operates by no one's rules but his own. He's also in chronic pain, limping on a cane with flames painted along the side and popping huge numbers of Vicodin, even in front of patients. While he's pushed away most of humanity, he's fortune enough to have a best friend, the long-suffering Dr. James Wilson (Robert Sean Leonard) as well as the support of the hospital's Dean of Medicine Dr. Lisa Cuddy (Lisa Edelstein). Despite almost daily clashes with the two, House knows he can count on them to back him up when he needs it.

House's team of fellows include Drs. Allison Cameron (Jennifer Morrison), Robert Chase (Jesse Spencer) and Eric Foreman (Omar Epps). Enduring regular emotional -- and sometimes physical -- abuse from their boss, the three will quickly say that they are only putting up with House in order to gain valuable experience to further their careers. But it's also apparent that after more than three years under his wing, each young doctor has grown to respect and care for House, who occasionally lets them see his damaged and human side.

As Season 2 ended with House being shot by the crazed husband of a former patient, Season 3 begins with his returning to work, presumably after taking the summer off to recuperate. House -- and everyone who knows him -- is thrilled to see that the ketamine used to help him through surgery continues to help him walk well and without pain. But will it last?

A plot arc involving Michael Tritter, a detective who swears to ruin House after the latter humiliates him in the hospital clinic, runs through several episodes. The detective's goal is to prove House is dangerous to patients because of his Vicodin addiction, and thus needs to have his license taken away. Many fans -- including myself -- felt this arc was poorly done, and did not contribute to the season's overall story growth.

Other memorable episodes include ""One Day, One Room,"" where a rape victim inexplicably latches onto House, causing him to reveal some troubling details about his own past; ""Half Wit,"" where House claims to have brain cancer while he and team treat a damaged musical prodigy played by Dave Matthews; and ""Top Secret,"" where Chase and Cameron embark upon a complicated new relationship.

Overall, the format of this show may seem too set or predictable; each episode, the team treats an unusual Patient of the Week, while dealing with side issues involving their own lives. Yet with the show's fantastic writing, this never happens. Rarely is anything predictable -- and as Dr. House is fond of saying, ""Everybody lies,"" so you can never tell what someone may be hiding until the very last minute. Each episode is enjoyable in its own way.

As for this box set, it's handsomely packaged. It includes a few extras, like behind-the-scenes with the medical props people and some bloopers (which are mostly just instances where the actors started to say their lines and burst out laughing, nothing truly ""blooper-worthy,"" in my opinion). If you look forward to the extras on DVD sets, this probably won't be your favorite.",1191974400,2,3280,4.825622775800712

And there were some hilarious episodes, as the one in which Dr. House wants his carpet back on his office and while the carpet ins't there he's attending his team in the church, in the entrance of the hospital... hilarious!

And as always there are some touching episodes, and some that really make you think, like the one in which they have to treat a young gipsy and the team of doctors have problems trying to get their points of view and treatments into work because the gipsies doesn't want to be ""experimented"" with, and that raises some issues of racism, prejudism...

And the creators have done it again & again. So we know it's the best show on TV out of all genres (yes, even the action/thriller 24 series, or arguably Heroes, cant beat it) but as far as real life is concerned - regardless whether or not any of the diseases is real or there's such a genius doctor, it poses the question whether our doctors have done enough before giving up.

2863570,5,B000R9YLKY,"Rude, condescending, sarcastic, belittling and brilliant.

If the combination of words that best describes someone has seemingly inherent contradictions, we need to look for addiction, however improbable it may at first seem. (This is the theme throughout my books, including&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-to-Spot-Hidden-Alcoholics-Using-Behavioral-Clues-to-Recognize-Addiction-in-Its-Early-Stages/dp/0967578868/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How to Spot Hidden Alcoholics: Using Behavioral Clues to Recognize Addiction in Its Early Stages</a>.) Since these terms are an apt description of Dr. Gregory House, the lead character on ""House,"" the odds are if we are able to peer into the person's private life we'll prove addictive use.

There is little on TV that brings thoughts such as ""brilliant"" or several belly laughs in almost every episode, but ""House"" manages. The tight and acerbic writing is comparable to that of the original ""Law and Order"" starring the late Jerry Orbach as Detective Lenny Briscoe. It, too, is one of the greatest series ever shown on the small screen. The culprit is a medical malady instead of a human one and Dr. House is a practicing pharmaceutical drug addict, while Briscoe was a recovering alcoholic.

The thread introduced in Season Three heightens the interest of an already great show for the addiction aware and helps to bust some of the myths of addiction (something I do to these and many more in my book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Alcoholism-Myths-and-Realities-Removing-the-Stigma-of-Society-s-most-Destructive-Disease/dp/0967578825/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Alcoholism Myths and Realities: Removing the Stigma of Society's most Destructive Disease</a>). House has supposedly been in chronic pain while gulping Vicodin like they're candy. He's nasty, mean-spirited and sarcastic to both staff and patients, which could be typical of an iNtuitive-Thinker M.D. addict. His nastiness was particularly pronounced while treating a detective named Michael Tritter (smartly played by David Morse). When Tritter realized that House was an addict, he decided to go after him. This marvelous thread continues throughout the Season.

""House"" is strongly recommended for very good acting, excellent writing, an interesting mystery, some very clever if mean-spirited sarcasm and a unique look at the possible behaviors of an addicted iNtuitive Thinker in his position. Even better, Season Three offers a view of several different people enabling for their own reasons, as well as how far an addict will go in destroying the lives of others to protect his perceived right to use.",1191542400,,2703,6.238605898123325

2863575,4,B000R9YLKY,"So far, Nip & Tuck has been the only TV serial that hasn't disappointed me at its third season.

Scrubs didn't grow an inch after the first two seasons. To be honest, Scrubs said EVERYTHING of itself in the first episodes.

Friends has been an ever-descending curve.

As regards House, its second season was superb, especially in its first part, when Stacey was present. Stacey was able to show some of House's faces that had been hidden that far.

The third season does not add much to all of this. [WATCH OUT: SPOILER IN THE NEXT SENTENCE] Not by chance, the fourth season will see a total renewal of the cast.

The relationship of House with his leg was recounted in a surprisingly non-articulate way (the doctor turns out to be a cripple in two episodes and neither he nor anybody really FACES the return of this devastating loss).

Twitter is a poor character. He chases House after admitting he wants to show he is a better bully than House is [?!?!]

House's and Wilson's friendship does not show images of itself that had not been presented before. Wilson is more and more passive to House and his personality does not show any growth-

The only character that shows some renewed interest is Cuddy, whose struggles to keep a teaching hospital working are shown in their deeper meanings.

As for the medical cases, they do not present any novelty. Some of the diagnosis are really difficult to believe.

2863577,5,B000R9YLKY,"Don't be fooled by the Negative Nannies who put down season three of ""House.""  This show has not missed a beat in its third year. ""House"" delivered once again on its initial promise of a hard-hitting smart combination of dramatic medical stories, laugh-out-loud comedic interludes, and compelling character-driven arcs.  Hugh Laurie continues to amaze as the soulfully tortured genius whose heart we are ever so slowly unpeeling.  Not one minute during which Laurie was on screen was wasted, boring, or conventional -- an astounding achievement in the third year of a network show. [Emmy voters mysteriously mesmerized by other, lesser actors need to wake up now before its too late!]  Favorite episodes include the riveting conclusion to the bad cop arc ""Merry Little Christmas"" in which we watch horrified as House descends to the grimmest depths imaginable. Also tops on my list was the charming series of episodes which let us know a bit more about the fascinating heated romantic entanglement between House and his boss Lisa Cuddy.  The extraordinary and sexy chemistry generated between Hugh Laurie and the intelligent and striking Lisa Edelstein was the overarching highlight of season three for me.  I also greatly enjoyed the twisted deepening of the characters of Wilson and Foreman, played expertly by Robert Sean Leonard and Omar Epps.  The skillful support Laurie enjoyed from Edelstein, Leonard, and Epps significantly strengthened this excellent season's drama.  Among many superior episodes, these stand out: ""Lines in the Sand,"" ""Son of a Coma Guy,"" ""Words and Deeds,"" ""Half-Wit,"" ""Top Secret,"" ""The Jerk,"" and ""Housetraining.""  Each of these episodes significantly advanced our knowledge of House's lonely inner journey, his desperate search for normality in the face of crushing pain, and his quest for meaning in a shattered life.  Guest actors John Laroquette, David Morse, Dave Matthews, Joel Grey and others all turned  in outstanding performances.

2863610,5,B000R9YLKY,"Hugh Laurie as the irascible Dr Gregory House has a lot to deal with in this season three dvd from dealing with  the ketamine treatment that Cuddy performed after the end of the last season to his vicodin addiction and the cop who tries to ruin him, to a confrontation with a girl who has been raped in One Day One Room to a patient that is more hateful than him and finally the resignation of Foreman and Cameron to the firing of Chase we see a different side of Dr House he becomes more dimensional in the third season. I think this is definately the best drama in tv it is a thinking persons show not just some fluff soap opera like Greys Anatomy. .This is a show for everyone who loves mystery and an intellectual challenge. Mr Laurie plays the role brilliantly along with a fine supporting cast .I recommend you also have a look at the first 2 seasons it won't take long to get hooked on this great show.",1190073600,,909,4.254335260115607

Incredible stories, humour, witty house-isms and most of all Hugh Laurie is absolutely amazing!  Watching him in the bloopers made me appreciate his talent even more.  This series is a must buy.  I did have trouble with the first disk, part of it froze and was pixelating. I had to fast forward through that part so I plan on doing an exchange.",1189900800,,502,4.413043478260869

2863616,5,B000R9YLKY,"Hugh Laurie, once again, takes what would have easily been another overly detailed medical drama and gives his comedic flare and dramatic edge.  How does a British speaking actor learn to speak all the medical terminology, as well as the rest of the dialogue for an entire episode and sound so American?  Almost as mysterious as one of Dr. House's cases.  The entire cast is superb and work well with Laurie.  The writers keep the show fun and interesting right through season three.

2863621,5,B000R9YLKY,"This third season of house was just as entertaining as preceding seasons.  As always, I am intrigued by the tension between House and his team and my silent hope that he will face his addictions, get help, let down his guard and tap into the softer side that he so desperately protects and hides.
I could really feel the struggle between the love House has for medicine as an art form, and the rest of the teams love for the patients and authentically wanting to help them.  The ending was sad but not surprising.  Is there hope for this egotistical, self-centered, and manipulative but brilliant Doctor?  I guess I will have to wait until season four!

You can really so the major changes in the fallows in this season above all cameron. The drama is stay writen well and Hugh Laurie still can pull off being american over all it is great season but a little to dark for my liking.,1189036800,,349,4.147058823529412

House season 3 dvd, as the first two seasons, has a great ""replay"" value, if you enjoy the brilliant writing and the acting.",1188950400,2,305,3.935483870967742
2863627,2,B000R9YLKY,"In the first two sesons of House, he was not only the selfish, agreesive, sarcasticc and arrrogant, super mind doctor but also, a human being with a golden heart that hides beneath all those layers of ugliness. At the same time de series never lost its ironic humor that is, most of the time refreshing and provocative.
The third season, is  complet disaster. It loses the humor and those tininig little things that keep House an human being and not a monster.
I love so intensily the first two season as I hated the 3th. It is a dark,  selfish, stupid, and intelectual limited House that crumbles like a blind rinoucerous along the episodes smashing and destroying everybody and everything. It looses al the deep and complex personality of the two first season and  becomes a one dimension caracter, a clich, a simplification, almost a  markting slogan. Target to whom? Not to me!",1188604800,11,881,4.738562091503268

Mr. Laurie's talent was so obvious, I knew he would be a big hit on US Television.  Little did I know that he would be maybe ""the best thing on television"", period!

If you have not purchased ""Jeeves & Wooster"", you must do so!  Laurie's comic timing and acting prowess is non-pareil.  You will laugh for hours.

Laurie rules!!!

Season 3 was fantastic.  I shall allow the others to relate the story lines to you--I just wanted to rate Laurie, himself.",1188259200,,574,4.504854368932039
2863631,5,B000R9YLKY,Season 3 of House M.D. is by far the most intense drama mini-series on Tv. This Season far outranks the previous seasons and keeps you on the edge of your seat wondering what witty statements Dr. House will say next and what the outcome is on the bizzare cases that he takes on.  The ending of this season leaves you in suspense on what is going to happen in Season 4. Don't miss out on the opportunity to own this product and don't miss all the extras that come along with this DVD.,1188259200,,483,4.193548387096774
2863632,4,B000R9YLKY,"""House"" is a brilliant series by American standards. Life and death issues are always compelling. HOWEVER like so many American progs it skates over very thin ice in terms of the facts. Most of the medical stuff is mumbo-jumbo at best and highly untypical in terms of the every day world of hospital practise. The best bit about it is the psychological interplay between the main characters eg the bureaucratic Cuddy and the maverick freeloading House. By the way no wonder Hugh Laurie got an Emmy. No one would ever believe he was British! His character is genuinely complex and deserves a good deal of credit.

It's very interesting to compare US and European series. The former are still very much fact/law based while the second go more for relationships. ""House"" is an interesting evolution.",1187827200,3,796,4.896296296296296
2863633,4,B000R9YLKY,"though the quality of the show is maintained, some of the major background plots that carry over between episodes felt very heavy handed and drawn out in season 3 (specifically the cop that house makes mad at him)

if you love everything house, this is still well worth getting. if your someone that picks and chooses without buying every season of a series, you could skip this one

i can rewatch seasons 1 and 2 alot more often than i can sit through 3 because i spend most of the time wanting to shoot the cop",1187827200,,512,4.322916666666667

2863635,5,B000R9YLKY,"This is the only show currently running which consistently holds my interest.  Most programming these days is ""reality"" programming--which seems to mean watching anxious people locked in fierce competitions which reveal the worst human characteristics and are often ugly to watch--that's cheap, junkfood TV and it truly is a mindless waste of time.  Dr. House is a breath of fresh air.  With all his oddities, his demons, his arrogance, and his brilliance, he's an original character I find fascinating.  He's locked in his own struggles, too, as are all the other members of the cast.  To me the fictional show seems more real and valid than all the ""reality"" shows.  It's a wonderful show and I look forward to each new episode.  Hope the entire team makes it back this fall!",1185062400,23,777,4.885496183206107
2863636,5,B000R9YLKY,"House is by far one of my three favorite shows on TV.  The state of medical care in the US today leaves so much to be desired, makes you wish you had a brilliant and no-holes-barred doctor like Gregory House.  Whatever it takes to diagnose and get you better is his motto.  This season I enjoyed the one big lesson of life, that being that death is an essential part of life.  It is always a hard one to face, but face it we all must.  This lesson leads to much dissent among his staff who are all dealing with the basic lessons of life - death, sex, and taxes (the last one really wasn't in this season and probably never will be - too mundane!).  Thus, we are left with the ending that leaves everyone - except House of course - trying to figure out how to deal with life itself.

The one thing in this season that really got to me was House's having to deal with the criminal justice system in all it's glory and corruption.  And I truly believe that the AMA had the say in how this season would play out in that regard.  I mean you just cannot have American TV protraying an esteemed doctor popping pills - narcotics no less - at will.  Never mind the guy is in constant pain and has no choice in the matter.  This image will not be allowed on prime-time TV.  Big brother gets bigger every year.  Please think about that, and remember that.  There was no reason for those episodes involving the police trying to curb an addiction that is perfectly normal for someone who takes narcotics on a daily basis.  Now the House we all grew to love is not the same man he was.  You rarely see him take any pills anymore, and it seems everyone in his life is trying to make him normal.  Well, if he was normal, we wouldn't love him so!  It wouldn't surprise me to see next season's introduction of ""Doctors on Narcotics Anonymous"" meetings!  Ridiculous.  Well, in my opinion, the AMA has toned the drug aspect of the show way down, and it has sort of taken the ""edge"" off the show.

I guess this is a fact of life that House had to face this year, just as his staff had to face their facts of life.  I hope they all learn to accept the reality of life - except House, of course.  He has his own reality and let no one interfere with it!

It was a great season, even if the AMA did irritate me, and I look forward to next season.  This series is definitely a winner, a thinker, controversial and yet tender at the same time.  Love it.",1184457600,9,2427,4.165591397849463
2863637,4,B000R9YLKY,"Someone would say you need a gimmick to make a show work (think Columbo's raincoat and cigar, Ironside's wheelchair, House's misused cane). House does misuse his cane, takes pain pills like penny candy and is an anti Doctor's  doctor. However the show gets better and better , season after season

Some critics of this season of House which had been shot and recovers in the first episode and then David Morse (St Elsewhere) played  a revengeful  cop House disrespected in his clinic visit as a JUMP THE SHARK (a term when a show needs a gimmick in a story arc) season. I do not think so. The story arc added to the drama. Now we know House won't lose his license or go to jail, unless they canceled the show and FOX wants this hit for 2 more seasons...so we know the interplay between characters works so well asnd delivers well during this personal crisis story line.

After the COP arc, the show was back to business as usually, until the second story arc, where Foreman (Omar Epps) wishes to leave House's team and the hospital. Here is acting at its best this season. Epps and Lurie play the power struggle with a Liar's poker style. There is a climax which is at the end of the season which will throw everyone for a loop. Emmy voters there is still time, Lurie and Epps for Best actor and best supporting actor in a drama, OKAY?

Some will ask why only 4 stars..well there were so much of the Cop and Foreman arc, that there were not many of those single Episodes where House and his team acted like miracle workers. Sometimes you watch this show like its CSI for medicine, there was some of that..I wanted more.. well there is always next season! It starts in October

2863638,2,B000R9YLKY,"It seems to me as though the moment I become devoted to a show, the writers and producers ruin it in their pursuit of a wider audience.  I loved the first two seasons of House.  But in Season 3, I finally stopped watching altogether. First, House was transformed from a selfish, funny, curmudgeonly guy who, nevertheless, we could believe had a heard of - well --  silver, maybe -- to a narcissist so without any redeeming qualities that I WANTED him to go to jail and never get out. (He was willing to have his only friends in the world lose their licenses rather than apologize to the cop?) This was the worst, but by far not the only negative development.  House became nasty not-funny instead of nasty-funny.  Almost nothing was funny all season. The entire story arc with the cop was annoyingly dumb as well - you don't have to be a lawyer to know that one lone cop cannot have the prescription privileges of several doctors suspended without at least lengthy administrative proceedings (wherein, or course, he could not have prevailed, since he had no evidence against them).  Suspension of disbelief is one thing, but this goes too far into fantasyland.  Finally, House's treatment of each of his colleagues was so over-the-top out-of-line mean that none of them would ever have forgiven him.  I didn't either.",1184112000,67,1317,4.745614035087719
2863639,5,B000R9YLKY,"One of the Best non fiction books I read last year and probably the best book on workplace dynamics, is ""The No ***hole Rule"". Almost every time I agree with that premise, the exceptions for me are if...

A) You really do know more than anyone else AND no one is listening, and

B) If it is a matter of life & death/ safety

Dr. House continues to be the most obnoxious character on television, and the most compelling. Too bad one never meets Doctors of that caliber in real life! As this season progresses, House begins to pay the price for his alienating behavior.

House continues to be one of the best dramas ever on TV., and one that is really perfect for a DVD marathon to help keep all the threads of the story in your head at once.",1183680000,16,740,4.226950354609929
2863640,5,B000R9YLKY,"I thought I'd grow bored with the series long before now. But...no...not only does House continue to grow and change, showing signs of humanity (the jury is still out on how MUCH compassion he has and whether he is more self-serving than not) but the other characters are being allowed to grow in surprising directions.

  If you are already a fan of this show, then I expect you'll probably want to get this. If not, don't start with the newest boxed set but go back and watch all the episodes. The dialogue is among the sharpest and wittiest out there.
