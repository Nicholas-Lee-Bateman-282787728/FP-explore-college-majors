599534,3,6303201261,"This is a cute movie, full of chuckles.  The lead actors in the movie, Winston Chao and some White guy, are awful.  Fortunately the direction and surrounding cast are good.  A solid script somehow manages to navigate the intersection of traditional-normative Chinese culture and normative American gay-male culture without grossly insulting either.  The film never really explores the two cultures or takes high risks, but hey--it's a comedy, and this one is good for some laughs.",974332800,4,480,5.276315789473684

The humor and interpersonal  interactions are realistic, humorous, and thought provoking.

599537,5,6303201261,"This movie continues to be recommended to me over and over as friends see it in art houses, rentals and on cable.  In turn, I recommend to others.  This is a dramatic slice of life masquerading as a comedy.  It is  hilariously funny, but when the house lights went back up they exposed  light sobbing by some of my group.
The plot is simple: gay Asian with  same sex mate decides to marry a woman needing a green card to fool his  ""old world"" visiting parents. Gayness is more a plot device than  an issue here.  It is easy to identify with these characters.  Though the  conflicts are comedic, they cannot be fully resolved.  It's a view of the  joys and frustrations of a loving family whose values are a big generation  apart.  The movie is partially subtitled and (I am not making this up)this  adds to the story because part of the humor is not everyone even  understands everyone else's language let alone lifestyles.

This film is superior in two ways: first, it is more understated than La Cage Aux Folles, making it less heavy-handed in its comedy; then, its characters are far more appealing and sympathetic that those in his later Brokeback Mountain, a film I am sorry to say is not worthy of all its hype since its own topic was better handled earlier in Boys in the Band or Kiss of the Spider Woman.",1449187200,2,598,4.348214285714286

599769,4,6303201261,"I enjoyed this comedy.

The very handsome Wai-Tung Gao/Winston Chao plays a very picky bachelor though he is secretly in a gay relationship with Simon/Mitchell Lichtenstein.  His mother, Mrs. Gao/Kuei Ya-lei, wants desperately for him to get married, and continues to pick potential brides for him, and bemoans that he is so picky.  Then she wants to visit.

It is then that Wai recruits his tenant, artist and illegal Wei-Wei Gu/May Chin to play his fiance.

His parents are disappointed there isn't more of a wedding, just a civil ceremony at the courthouse, so they set an elaborate wedding banquet.  There is tension.  For Simon is sick of the whole pretense.  And Wei-Wei truly loves Wai, and Wais mother loves Wei-Wei.

But Wais father surprises them.

They surprise each other.

The ending is probably one of my favorite endings in film.

Yes, it is a comedy, and a romance, but it is beautiful and heartfelt.

My one quibble is that at times it was clear May Chin was dubbed.  Her hair fell over her face, and the voice that spoke could not be hers.  I don't care about the dubbing, I just wish it was more precise.

599859,5,6303201261,"Ang Lee's ""The Wedding Banquet"" could easily serve as a more lighthearted yet moving pendant to his later unprecedented success - ""Brokeback Mountain"".  TWB also deals with a gay subject where the two key figures must hide their orientation from family members.  The big difference here is that both are together and out; both are successful in their respective professions; both are comfortable with their situation. Then, into their world comes a sudden visit from the parents of one of them who happens to be Chinese and whose family is highly traditional. Now, things really begin to happen at a record pace. Anything hinting of gay in their home is quickly removed from sight and replaced with more ""conventional"" decoration. A female friend who is Chinese is presented as a fiance. The true partner is presented as the ""landlord"".  What could possibly go wrong?  As it happens, the father of the potential groom is a good friend of one who owns a banquet/dining hall.  The two men go back to the time when China fell to the Communists. The friend offers his facilities gratis to have a ""Wedding Banquet"".  As events proceed, the real relationship becomes strained during the effort to hide things from the parents.  The wedding banquet does take place.  But, throw in too much to drink, the raging hormones of youth, an aggressive ""bride"" who takes her role too seriously, a suspicious mother, and we have a cocktail for potential disaster. Without giving anything away, our story does play out to a satisfying conclusion depending upon your perspective and vantage point.  One hint: The Chinese father is not all that he appears to be and plays a key yet subliminally important role in the final denoument. The music which literally underscores the film is brief but beautiful and hits just the right emotional notes (pardon the pun).

This is a good movie however I give it only 3 stars due to poor editing. Basically it does a very good job of showcasing how the choice of a young man's homosexual lifestyle brings great pain and shame to his parents. What is natural is also showcased and contrasted by the fact that this homosexual young man becomes aroused sexually and is able to impregnate a young woman posing as his wife. What is right and natural does exist in humanity, in the law of everyone's heart. However this young man's choice to deviate from what is right and natural only leads to shame and despair.

600073,5,6303201261,"i should have known ang lee could not make a dud movie.  from the very first frame of this film, you know that this film is universal because it involves family.  yes, the couple at the core are gay but small matter.  everyone will easily be able to recognize the contacts with the parents as identical to their own, no matter what race, religion, etc., you happen to be.  we hear the mother's voice over trying to manipulate her son into getting married yet again.  they want grandchildren.  he is their only child. they sign him up for expensive singles clubs, send women to meet him at his home in NYC, phone him in the middle of the night as to his romantic life, etc., etc., meanwhile, he is all but married but to another man, Simon, who is also a great character.  this sets everyone in the movie on a hilarious collision course.

this was made in the early nineties. i wonder if by today the characters wouldn't think of sexual surrogacy to solve this problem.  i don't know if this would satisfy the elder asian couple completely but it would solve their main problem as to continuing the family line.  their son finds a surrogate who uses in vitro fertilization with him and she carries the resulting baby(ies). it is not a perfect solution but they had a lot of money to throw around on the wedding which could have been put towards a baby instead without his marrying a woman.  for people dying for grandchildren, it is another alternative in 2013.

600158,5,6303201261,"Ang Lee creatively uses the conventional social mores and cultural behaviors associated with a traditional Taiwanese family along with their expectations of a good life for their number one son and compares and clashes them with the modern gay lifestyle which the son has kept secret from his family. This is one major comedy where surprises and deception continually arise to keep the viewer laughing and enjoying the events that unfold throughout. The film is jam packed with subtle and direct playful scenes by the director which reveal Chinese cultural expectations for a proper married life which contrasts with the freedom of expression (both verbal and sexual) allowed and experienced in the West. Ang Lee shows the viewer he is sympathetic to both sides of the issue. His film is outstanding and unique. It is a one-of-a-kind film which only a person of his background and understanding could have made.

Gao Wai Tung (the number one Chinese son) arranges a marriage of convenience at the suggestion his lover of over 5 years, Simon, to help out a female artist, Wei Wei from Taiwan, just so she can attain the green card to stay in the USA. When his parents hear of their only son's marriage, they arrive in New York and are highly disappointed with the arrangements the couple made for a civil ceremony. They plan an elaborate wedding celebration which is filled with  numerous comedic twists and turns that revolve around the secrets and deception associated with their son's gay lifestyle. A Taiwanese/Chinese wedding is filled with hilarity and games and the married couple must go along with it all ... The biggest surprise is when Wei Wei announces to Gao Wai that she is pregnant. A grandchild is one of the most cherised gifts that Chinese parents look forward to from their offspring, yet this unexpected outcome of a drunken wedding night complicates the lives of both the gay couple and Wei Wei in unimaginable ways. This surprise creates the need for more deception and secrets that must be kept from Gai Wai Tung's parents. It is an amazing set of events that transpire which helps resolve this major dilemma in an already complicated state of affairs. Ang Lee manages to wrap up the ending to this film in a most satisfying manner with more surprises than any viewer could possibly anticipate! This is one hilarious comedy on a highly unusual but modern subject. Ang Lee managed to break down barriers, plus enlighten and entertain all at the same time!

This film is directed by a clever Taiwanese director, Ang Lee, who was honored the academy's award a few years ago.

This black comedy has several layers: the gay, the immigration, and the old generation (the parents). An interracial relationship is never easy when you have a conservative Taiwanese parents and you are gay. A 'green' marriage could help you out from creating a mirage to your parents. Seems a win-win situation before your parents smell something fishy...

600227,4,6303201261,"I first saw the WEDDING BANQUET upon initial release, and I revisited it again recently.  A bit more sophisticated in its' human observations, it's a film that has grown stronger with time's passage.

Lee emerged as an independent filmmaker (an alum of NYU, along with the likes of Spike Lee and Jim Jarmusch, who also emerged from the school during the 1980s), and his earliest films were a great indication that independent filmmaking could tackle complex themes, surpassing Hollywood standards, and still connect meaningfully with audiences.

Lee also may be ahead of his time as a globally focused filmmaker - also evident here.  With an unusual knack for balancing cultural specifics (and how they fit into individual lives), and broader universal elements, Lee handles cultural clashes, and assimilation wonderfully - WEDDING BANQUET features some of the most entertaining riffs on such themes (the justice of the peace wedding scene is definitely a classic comic moment) to have graced the big screen.  To varying degrees, these themes have surfaced in some fashion in all of Lee's films (also notably in EAT DRINK MAN WOMAN, and it's US remake TORTILLA SOUP); here they are at their most charming.

Overall this film was marketed as something like a gay-themed update on the classic Hollywood ""screwball comedy"" genre, which it isn't exactly - WEDDING BANQUET moves at a slower pace, and has its' share of humor, but also offers an abundance of very thoughtfully crafted drama.  Like EAT DRINK (and also ICE STORM), Lee is very skilled at shaping relationships, and zeroing in on poignant insights within even the bad moments, and in many ways this film stands as one of his finest.

This tightly plotted story revolves around a Taiwanese-American businessman.  He's handsome, successful, and in a committed relationship.  Yet he can't introduce his love to his parents - not because his love is a blond American but because his love is a man.  Our hero isn't ashamed of being gay.  Yet his father has a heart condition, his parents are conservative, and he is their only son.  The pressure to get married increases as he turns thirty.

Most of the film is madcap comedy culminating in a full scale Chinese wedding banquet.  In one traditional game guests line up to kiss the blindfolded bride on the cheek.  Where the goal is to identify her husband, she mistakenly picks a ten-year-old boy.  The story shifts to serious drama without missing a beat.

For a movie that seems to benefit from lots of money and production values, nothing in the way of the story was lost.  This is an excellent film depicting the life of a gay couple in 1993.  It's about a culture clash between the growing openness of America vs. the unknown (to me) Asian cultures.

It is both a sweet love story and a dramatic film about a couple dealing with parents.  I think in the end all the characters in the film ended up with more than they ever hoped for.

The film did a great job of focusing on people's individual expectations, and the means by which people would go in order to live up to those of their parents'.
I was lucky enough to talk to Ang Lee at a film discussion last year.

In some respects, I found ""The Wedding Banquet"" to be the most accessible and intimate of his films that I have seen.  It's certainly the most humorous.
The plot has been summarized by other reviewers, and in lesser hands it could easily have turned the film into a cliche.  Given that the film appeared in the early 1990's, it could also have look dated to viewers in 2004.  However, this film is not dated and it's not a cliche.  Instead, it's a warm-hearted (but never maudlin) look at the importance of family, cultural heritage, and the difficulty of leading a hidden life, even when your relatives live on the other side of the world.
Much of the dialogue is Chinese (with English subtitles), but this is one of those rare films where I quickly became accustomed to the subtitles and they did not interfere at all with my enjoyment of the movie.  The fact that the Chinese characters actually spoke Chinese made the film more believable.
Ang Lee's talent for visual composition is apparent throughout the movie.  It's filled with scenes of real beauty, which is not always the case with comedies.  Too often, movie comedies are shot as if they were widescreen TV sitcoms.  That's not the case here.

Ting Gao [Winston Chao] is a thirtysomething Taiwanese immigrant who lives in New York, where he has a real estate business. He seems to be heavily subsidized by his wealthy family back home. His Mom and Dad are constantly pushing him to get married. Why can he not grant his father's fondest wish to become a grandfather? Ting can't do his parents' long distance bidding because he happens to be gay. He lives happily with a nice guy named Simon [Mitchell Lichtenstein]. The very American and liberated Simon is wise enough to see that cultural differences prevent his lover from admitting the truth. The deception is no problem until the folks announce their imminent arrival in New York. The boys come up with a plan. Ting will marry their friend Wei-Wei [May Chin], who happens to need a green card anyway. The parents will arrive, Wei-Wei and Ting will marry in a civil ceremony, the family will leave, and life will return to normal. All goes according to plan until an old family acquaintance shows up and insists on giving the bride and groom a lavish, old-fashioned Chinese wedding banquet. The plan then hits some serious snags.

It wouldn't be such a big deal if Wei Tung's parents decide not to come to congratulate their son.  Now they have to fake a wedding and living together.  Simon becomes their landlord.  Everyone is trying to compromise.  Everyone is trying to finish the ""act"" and go on their own lives. But is it as easy as they thought?  The wedding itself is a perfect demonstration of melting pot culture.  But at the end of the banquet there is a little twist.  Now what's gonna happen? Is everything still fake?
This movie reveals the conflict between traditional Chinese culture and independent American culture, the different aspects in sexuality and morality, and different concept of family, love and honesty.  How hard is it for one to survive in a society with other kinds (being either a foreigner or a gay) and being accepted?  You will find it out through laugher, tears, heartbreaks and strong wills.  You will enjoy the movie, and keep going back to watch it again and again.",976838400,,1340,4.635593220338983

7841242,4,6303201261,"The Wedding Banquet is a comedy about a young gay man who must hide his secret and marry in order to placate his traditional parents.

Gay couple Wai-Tung (Winston Chao, Eat Drink Man Woman) and Simon (Mitchell Lichtenstein, Streamers) are happily cohabitating in New York when word comes from Wai-Tungs parents, who, tired of waiting for their son to marry and give them grandchildren, have hired a dating service to get him closer to the altar. Wai-Tung and Simon hatch a plot that bring about a marriage of Wai-Tung and Wei-Wei (May Chin, Woman Soup), an acquaintance in need of a green card. All seems to go well until Wai-Tungs parents announce a visit and insist that a customary wedding banquet is given to make up for the less-than-spectacular city hall marriage ceremony.

Director Ang Lee (Life of Pi, Brokeback Mountain) combines comedy with biting social asides. The jokes are often predicated on genuine pain and confusion as Wai-Tung is torn between a lifestyle he has embraced and his devotion to his parents. This kind of film could easily have drifted into broad yuk-yuks by treating its characters as caricatures and stereotypes, but Lee keeps the situation believable. The humor derives from the relationships and the conflict between modern, enlightened society and old-school traditions. The Chinese cultural traditions portrayed are a significant part of the story, and are treated respectfully, rather than as a source of one-liners.

Bonus materials on the Blu-ray release include the featurette A Forbidden Passion, and a trailer.",1504656000,2,1555,5.162698412698413

7841247,5,6303201261,"Ang Lee is my favorite director, and early on he evinced the ability to present complex situations in shades of gray, i.e., not to reduce them to stereotypes.  ***SPOILER ALERT***  It's quite rare, in my experience, for someone (be they straight, gay, or somewhere in between) not to do just that where sexuality is comcerned.  Remarkable- Lee feels no need to explain the characters' sexuality (that is, how a gay man could desire sex with a woman).  Sexuality is often not cut and dried (though the majority of folks regardless of their sexual orientation seem to behave as if it is).  These are people who love each other, it's complicated.  Wonderful.  And even dear old ex-military Dad is able to view the situation realistically.  And this is just ONE aspect of this film that's unusual.  Love it.",1478908800,2,803,4.802919708029197
