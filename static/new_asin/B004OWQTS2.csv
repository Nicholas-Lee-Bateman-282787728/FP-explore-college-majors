4441944,5,B004OWQTS2,The family are big fans of Penn  and Teller.  We have all  eight of their seasons.  Each season is quite entertaining as well as educational.,1357862400,,141,4.52
4441945,4,B004OWQTS2,"The last season, unfortunately. These guys aren't always right, but they always make you think. They cover a wide range of subjects here, some of which you wondered weren't covered in an earlier series. And boobs.",1356220800,,213,4.944444444444445
4441946,5,B004OWQTS2,"This last season is excellent.

The Cheerleading episode is both eye-opening, and probably not in the way you're expecting.

I'm going to miss this show.",1318118400,2,153,5.08
4441947,5,B004OWQTS2,I love this show.  I have all the dvds.  I hope they never run out of BS to talk about.,1316736000,,87,3.3
4441948,4,B004OWQTS2,"Whatever topic P&T are covering, whenever they trot out the Cato Institute or Reason Magazine or some libertarian talking head, all I hear is the sound of axes being ground.  I'm not saying that what libertarian think-tank Cato Institute has to say about, say, cheerleader injuries and Title IX (as in the first episode in the season) is WRONG.  Actually, it sounded fairly persuasive.  It's just that as soon as I see debunking tied to an ideology (other than science and philosophical skepticism, that is), I begin to lose interest.

Like in the midst of an otherwise excellent episode on BS related to ""old people,"" we get the libertarian take on end-of-life issues.  I happen to agree with the position taken--that we should have the right to self-determination for such a personal decision--but would have preferred another source.  Otherwise it starts to look like a case is being made for planks in a party platform.

All of which is probably a big part of the reason that my two favorite episodes were Cato Institute/Reason Magazine/libertarian shill-free: the one on self-esteem and the one on anti-vaxxers.  But the one on anti-vaxxers most of all.  It would not be saying too much for me to say that for me that one was worth the price of the series all by itself.  Of all the BS currently floating around, by far the most immediately and tragically dangerous is the anti-vaxxer BS.  And P&T did a superb job of dismantling the ""argument"" on the anti-vaxxer side--with trademark wit and telling interviews.

But as much as I loved that particular episode, and as much as I find some of the outrageous high jinks still highly entertaining, and as much as I respect what Penn and Teller set out to do, it's hard to escape the sense that with most of the big fish fried, finding 12 more worthy topics for next season, much less any additional seasons, will be a challenge and probably a chore.  The one BS episode that Penn once mentioned wanting to do that I'd like to see is the one on the ""BS of BS.""  Because the greatest value of skepticism is that it teaches us to be skeptical about ourselves--our own biases and sacred cows and blind spots.  If P&T were able to pull that off in the style they've applied to others, it would be the very model of how skepticism ultimately must work to be invaluable.

June 6 edit: I just learned that this was in fact the last season of BS, and that Penn & Teller will instead be starting a new show on Discovery this fall.  And after complaining that they couldn't reasonably find 12 more worthy topics to cover in another season, I find myself a little sad at the show's passing.  What was I thinking?  We might be close to peak oil, but we're nowhere NEAR peak BS.",1305504000,8,2716,4.574380165289257
4441949,4,B004OWQTS2,"Kudos again to Penn and Teller for their confirmation of what we have long suspected as BS behind several of the topics.  This season delivers same quality and humor as the previous seasons and would only be better if it had more episodes.  Maybe I just can't get enough.  My wife especially enjoys Penn and Tellers equal opportunity display of gratuitous wang to compliment all the boobs, which I thoroughly enjoy.  As for the difference between the two CDs, I got the longer version thinking that it would include a lost/censored episode akin to the notorious Vatican episode.  Sadly, the longer disc only includes two episodes of another Showtime series called ""Episodes"" which has nothing to do with Penn and Teller.  Aside from the disappointment of missing out on bonus P&T footage (or maybe bonus boobs), I'm glad we were able to get a copy of this eighth installment.  Hopefully they'll produce more seasons....",1304726400,10,919,4.928571428571429
4441950,2,B004OWQTS2,"I was just about to pre-order this for tomorrow and then I see that this one is $28 at 275 minutes while there's one that's the same in every way but is 255 minutes at $23.
What's with the missing 20 mintes?  What will I miss? Will I miss anything at all? Has it been sensored? What is the deal here?
UPDATE FOR THE 'COMMENTS' ON MY REVIEW

Apparently the English language and the definition of the noun 'product' has eluded those fine, intelligent Amazon reviewers who have commented on my review for these versions of Penn and Teller's product.
As an educational service I'll point out a couple of facts here...the product in question has 2 different versions at variable playing lengths.  Therefore, these 2 products are not the same and one may contain more Penn and Teller antics than the other.

I like Penn and Teller antics and would prefer to witness more rather than less of their talents prior to buying this DVD set.

In view of this fact this review is appropriate as a product review because the product offering is unclear and the intelligent buyer will become informed about the best quality product BEFORE a purchase is made.
I would also urge those of you who believe that an electronic insult is a good idea to perform your own personal review of the quality of the thoughts and actions that you produce.
You may be disappointed in your own review and may see yourself as others do...a less than adequate intellect that earns less than a 2-star rating. Oh, by the way...bite me.",1304294400,5,1497,4.57089552238806
4441951,2,B004OWQTS2,I'm seeing that this is 255 minutes at $23 and the other is 275 minutes at $28.  What's the deal?  what's the difference here?  Is there reall a missing 20 minutes on the $23 version? Why?,1304294400,,188,4.166666666666667
4441952,5,B004OWQTS2,"What can I say...Penn and Teller did it again.

4441956,5,B004OWQTS2,"Consistent with the other seasons of this series, Penn and Teller explore the hysteria surrounding teen sex, Area 51, easy money (multi-level marketing schemes), and vaccinations. As usual, they interview both crackpots and bona fide experts in each field.  Very funny but also illuminating.",1417478400,,291,5.613636363636363

8437342,5,B004OWQTS2,"Another great season of Bulls***, I just wish they would make more.

Or how about a special on the Electoral Collage, I kind of think that would be timely.",1480550400,,155,4.344827586206897

8437344,5,B004OWQTS2,"I'm a big fan of Penn and Teller. I've seen their show in Las Vegas, I've watched their TV shows. This was their last season for ""Bulls***!"" and all of the seasons are worth watching. I probably agree with 98% of what they say on the shows. Many of their topics are obviously BS and we didn't really need them to point it out but the shows are entertaining anyway.",1463356800,,364,4.214285714285714
8437345,5,B004OWQTS2,"Aside from my disappointment with the censorship issue (the missing Vatican ep), I love this show and this was another outstanding season of one of my favorite shows.
