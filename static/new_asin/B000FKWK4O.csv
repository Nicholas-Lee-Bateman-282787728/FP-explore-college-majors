2571084,5,B000FKWK4O,"This workout is oh so great and oh so tough. I'm talking about 35 minutes of high impact cardio moves sequenced to great music. Luckily, Lisa's cueing is fantastic so if you can handle the high impact you'll be ok. For beginners, you may find the workout to be quite difficult simply because the instructor showing beginner modifications barely gets any camera time. You will need the Firm Box, or the Transfirmer for this one. I suppose you could try it with a regular, non inclining, step, but you would be s.o.l. when it comes time for inclined aerobics. Also, this workout requires you to have lots of room around your step for all 5 sets of aerobics, so If you have a small, confined workout space you may want to pass on this one.",1212019200,10,736,4.45925925925926
2571085,5,B000FKWK4O,"The Firm line of work out products is by far the best I have ever tried. Its combination of weights and aerobics melts off the fat and tones muscles at the same time. During my pregnancy, I gained a total of fifty pounds. Thanks to the firm, I now weigh ten pounds less than I did before I got pregnant, and it only took me a couple months to take it all off. The Firm videos are time efficient and fun. The music they are syncronized to is upbeat and fun. I would highly suggest anyone with a desire to tone up try these out!",1151539200,5,526,4.019047619047619
8124444,4,B000FKWK4O,"This video is extremely advanced.  You can not use a regular step to do this workout - you have to buy the FIRM box.  I've used other FIRM step workouts on a normal stepper, but this one you can't.  You are jumping side to side, doing burpees, and all kinds of quick, high impact moves on this box.  You can't do it fast enough with the regular length stair stepper and also one that does not incline.

I really struggled, but never made it through the DVD.  I didn't want to rate it poorly because the workout and DVD quality are good - you just need the FIRM box and to be very young and athletic to be able to do this workout. I'm donating my copy to my local library.",1483920000,3,671,4.083969465648855
8124445,4,B000FKWK4O,"I've had all the other workouts in this series for years, but only recently acquired this one.  Fat Blasting Cardio(FBC) and Express Cardio (EC) are the other two cardio workouts from the series.  Of the three, this one is my least favorite.

It is advanced in terms of getting the heart rate up, but the choreography is fairly simple.  Libby modifies the moves if you want to keep it low impact, because it is higher impact than most Firm workouts.  Lisa Kay is a good instructor, she cues very well.

This one doesn't use weights at all, which was a little disappointing.  Both FBC and EC use light weights and I think it adds to the workout.

By the end, I was definitely sweaty and felt like I had gotten a good workout in a short period of time.",1458864000,,750,4.345323741007194

8124451,5,B000FKWK4O,"I've actually owned this DVD workout for over 6 years now. This is pretty much one of the only FIRMS where you use NO weights at all, just the FIRM box. I don't own the blue one in the picture, but the ""Body Shaping"" black 3-leveled one I have owned for years works like a charm! I also own the original FIRM fanny lifter (the wooded one that was made back in the early 90's), and use that one for the first segment.

First of all, this workout clocks in about only 20 (not counting warm up and cool down).

The first segment is the HARDEST. You do slow step ups on the 14 inch then doing hand stand/kickbacks. (Not actually hand stands, but you you bend over fast and grab the 14 inch then kicking your legs back, then quickly stepping up)..to me,that is the most challanging part---and never gets old!! LOL

Then the 2nd segment she does plyos, and you jump around the box, although not really using it.

The 3rd, you use the stepper more for step areobics.

The 4th you also use it as an incline.

Overall, I would call this advanced, however advanced exercisers may still consider this as high intermediate. This one is actually a very nice cardio workout-in the shortest amount of time.

8124452,5,B000FKWK4O,"This is one of the best Firm cardio workouts out there. It's only 30 minutes long but it'll have your heart rate up as soon as the warm up is over, and it doesn't let up until the end. This is pure cardio using the adjustable step (I use the transfirmer with it). It's a great workout and one I love to do when I'm short on time. Warning: it's not for beginners!",1256860800,,362,3.9726027397260273
8124453,3,B000FKWK4O,"I was a little disappointed with this workout. It's ALOT of jumping so if you have bad knees, it will be a killer. I also thought there would be more ""sculpting"" as the title indicates. No hand weights or ankle weights are used. ""Sculpting"" to me implies a slower pace, using weights with repetitive moves (ex. leg lifts, etc...) This one is all cardio. I didn't feel like I sculpted much.",1223596800,2,389,4.492957746478873
