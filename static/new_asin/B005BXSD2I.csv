Then he gets his conscription notice in the mail and goes to town for his physical examination, while there he meets a gal. He returns home for a series of unexplainable scenes without dialog that reminded me of '2001' and 'Big Fish'. Occasional beautiful scenes, usually in long shots.

8597216,5,B005BXSD2I,"I am utterly ashamed that I have only now, about a year after watching this DVD, come around to reviewing it on Amazon. Its Turkish dialogue, independent releasing and lack of reviews make it easy to overlook. I came to watch it in making an informed decision about whether to learn Turkish, wanting to hear what the language sounded like, what Turkey was like, etc. Watching it one night, and again the next night, a rare honor for any film, I was thunderstruck by how it spoke to me. It immediately became the 4th best film I had ever seen, and have seen yet, although you are not likely to find it on any critic's top list. On a somewhat topical note, if you are interested in watching a Turkish film, definitely start here over less meaningful fare such as ""Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"", even though it hasn't won prizes in Hollywood or Cannes.

Anyways, I watched the Yusuf trilogy, three films about Yusuf as a grown man (Yumurta - Egg), as a young man (St - Milk), and finally as a young boy (Bal - Honey). Strangely, the films are reversed in the order of human development, and all take place in modernity, with cell phones, modern cars and dress and such, even though Yusuf is less than 10 years old in Bal and about 40 in Yumurta. Yusuf's love interest in Yumurta is played by the same actress as a girl Yusuf asks on a date in St, but the meaning of this chronological decoupage eludes me.

St follows Yusuf as he has literally just graduated from high school and getting dropped off by the bus, and in only a few moments we see how awkward, quiet, and different he is from his peers. He is a nascent poet and a narcoleptic, who hopes to be published, hopes to make it big. He faces disappointment in his poetic career and watches his like-minded friend be swallowed by the mining industry and his poet teacher drown in alcohol. His mother, trying to get her dairy business off the ground, wants him to devote his time to helping her make repairs and deliver milk. The reverse chronology of the trilogy will see his father dead in the next film after falling out of a tree; his mother has been widowed those 10 years, and she receives some interest from a widower station-master who helps her with a flat tire. His (not Oedipal) jealousy of her and fear at discovering that she is a woman as well as a mother proves to be too much.

The story is simple, pedestrian, but subtly presented, rich in details of character and natural beauty. I don't believe in spoilers, but I also would not want to speak in great detail about just how beautiful the prologue and the last two scenes are, so that you don't simply go into the movie giddy at the beginning and anticipating the end, without appreciating the fine brushwork in between. (You will ask yourself whether the snake and the fish are real, and how the director was able to so silently, artfully, and mathematically describe the point where boyhood meets manhood, and where a relationship between a mother and son reaches its peak and immediately begins its decline.)

There is no score. The performances throughout are graceful; the leads are solid, of course. The cinematography captures the natural beauty of people, Turkey, existence, as if it were a tangle of threads that could be snatched out of the air. Whoever would stay to collect them after the crowds have died down, and pick these threads off the ground, out of his hair and the tree branches, fish them out of the river, and pull out those stuck in his mouth*, they'll have the biggest share.

(The director alleges the snake is real, so Google ""St Semih Kaplanoglu"" to read about this ingenious cinematic trick.)",1373414400,2,3642,4.52887537993921
