6164164,5,B00HHVFW6M,I purchased this set of celebrity roasts because I always loved watching them weekly on television and thought it would be great entertainment for our monthly senior casino bus trips.  I'm so glad I did because our attendees loved-loved-loved them.  They resulted in so much laughter on the bus and filled the time gap for an otherwise quiet ride home.  All the people are looking forward to the next DVD on our future rides.  Thanks for the opportunity to reminisce!!,1398038400,17,468,4.8125

6164196,5,B00HHVFW6M,"Again I'm reviewing another DVD of Dean Martin Roasts...first off this DVD has a lot of extras on each Disc which I keep saying is important to me. Not only does it give you an insight into the people they talk about and peels away at the different celebrities that many of us only knew by watching TV.  There are still the hilarious roasts with: Red Buttons, Nipsy Russell, Orson Wells, Audrey Meadows, Rich Little, Ruth Buzzi, etc. etc. I stop at Ruth Buzzi because she gives an interview that digs deep in the back story of many celebrities and many of the politicians that used to grace the dais at the roasts. They even have a special feature of celebrities talking about Politicians, and that was because Barry Goldwater, Hubert Humphrey, and Ronald Reagan were featured in these various roasts. I might be thinking of the other DVD set, because I've been watching these DVD sets back to back now. Other features have excerpts from the Dean Martin Comedy Hour which I used to watch as a kid. I do remember watching Foster Brooks and thinking he was a genius at impersonating a drunk. Some people that were interviewed I think on the last disc made some statements that made me wonder about these DVD sets.  JJ Walker talks about how those roasts were 2 hours long, and so it made since that evidently they were edited down for these sets!  Especially when you see 2-4 guests on the Dais that don't get up and make any speeches!  Then in this DVD set they go from Man/Woman of the Hour to Man/Woman of the week which I don't remember.  Because in one of these segments it only lasted 18 minutes on one of them...where some of the others were at least 30 minutes long.  More celebrities come to the defense of Dean Martin and explain that Dean Martin didn't drink like he portrayed to his audience. It has been some time, but I read the autobiography of Dean Martin and that's where I had learned that he didn't drink as much as he portrayed. I kind of got upset over an interview from Fred Willard because he portrayed Johnny Carson as a snob, and wouldn't talk to him I guess when he used to work for him. In earlier interviews from everyone else either on these DVD sets or I had heard that Johnny Carson was a very private man when off camera, and was very shy.  Several people have stated that believe it or not Johnny Carson who was a huge celebrity was actually shy to talk to people and thus because of it seemed snobbish maybe.  But put him behind the desk at NBC and turn on the lights and camera and he knew how to make people comfortable and look good in front of the camera.  Anyway....the extras from these DVD's is well worth the money to buy these sets!",1422316800,9,2673,4.394736842105263

8632819,5,B00HHVFW6M,"Some really big stars and athletes here are getting it just as well as they're giving it.  Today's PC police and snowflakes need to go away into their little safe spaces and never return.  Pick up a copy before they make these harmless dvds disappear.  A lot of these athletes and entertainers were truly talented, personable and admirable.
Product info - video and audio do appear to have been remastered as they say.  Some of the audio tracks sound like they're mismatched.  With some of the roasts, the guests standing at the podium speaking into the microphones seem to be on a different audio track from the audience laugh track.  All the speakers in a couple of programs are consistantly hard to hear while the laugh track of the same programs seem to roar by comparison.  I'm a little disappointed as I find it distracting but that's probably just me.",1502668800,,858,4.68
