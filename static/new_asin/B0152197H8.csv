7425473,4,B0152197H8,I have three children and want to tone up.  I have lost all the weight.  This video is very difficult but I like it a lot.  I don't think it is possible to get a six pack again even with these exercises though.  I run as well and find it more useful then the cardio in this DVD.  I use the core exercise portion.,1451692800,2,312,3.8125
7425474,5,B0152197H8,I love Moms Into Fitness dvds.  Lindsay is great!,1450051200,,49,4.444444444444445

7425476,5,B0152197H8,"This is hard! I just finished pretty fierce weight loss and thought that this would be a piece of cake...wrong! I was out of breath doing the Core Torch workout and I struggled finishing the Barefoot Core. But Lindsay is so motivating that I just want to please her, make her proud, so I do my best. Mind you, after one week I can see a flatter tummy and I feel ALL the muscles in the core area. Can't wait to see what the other three workouts look/feel like :). The DVD works fine, but a real gem is the meal plan. Make sure you get it from Lindsay's web page. I love Lindsay's workouts, this one is no exception.",1447632000,4,614,4.125
7425477,5,B0152197H8,"Whoa!!  These exercises are great!!  This is my second Lindsay Brin purchase (first one was Shed 5 Fast, which is also good), and now I'm totally hooked; I just purchased her Pretty Fierce Extreme Lean Out & Pretty Fierce X series (from a different site).  I plan on starting those programs after this.

Like most moms, my trouble area is the belly & I although I'm in pretty good shape and exercise regularly, I have yet to find a program that effectively trims the tummy.  I'm hoping this program will do the trick & so far, it seems like it just might!  What I love about this program is that it works the TOTAL body, not just the core (which is so important).  This is such a well rounded program!  It has everything you need from body weight training, strength training, cardio, & even flexibility, all while emphasizing on the core.

Also, this comes with two different training calendars, a regular version & an advanced version.  Some of the workouts with the advanced version are 6 to 8 minutes longer than the regular workout, and trust me, those few minutes makes a HUGE difference.  I'm following the regular calendar, but I was curious about the advanced workouts, so I tried the advanced cardio torch today and OMG I so wish I hadn't. The additional 6 minutes towards the end were killer!!!  So, what I've decided to do is turn this into a 60 day program.  After I complete the regular 30 day core program, I will continue on to the advanced version for an additional 30 days.

I will update my review after I compete the program (if I can remember).  Anyway, I highly recommend this program, not just to moms, but to anyone who wants a complete fitness program that focuses on the core!!  By the way, the nutrition plan is also great & allows you to eat ""regular food.""

Great job, Lindsay!!  Can't wait for more!",1446422400,5,1828,4.521341463414634
7425478,5,B0152197H8,This workout program is great! It works all my muscles in under 30 minutes and has me losing inches!,1445299200,,100,4.315789473684211
7425479,5,B0152197H8,"I have just begun this workout DVD. I have four young kids and therefore some extra pounds around my waistline. I also have chronic back pain. I figured this core workout will hopefully help with both of those issues.
Each of the workout videos has three women doing the exercise. Lindsay Brin does the workout in the middle, then on one side of her she has someone doing an easier version of the exercises and on the other side she has someone doing a more advanced version. This is really great because it ensures that the workout will be doable for you no matter what your fitness level. I happen to be very out of shape right now so and if I had to keep up with the more difficult version I would likely quit before getting too far. I follow the modifications for the easier version and find the workout tough but doable. This feature will also allow the workout to be effective for another few rounds because I can increase the level of intensity the next time i start by following the more difficult workouts.
The DVD directs you to a calendar on Lindsay Brin's website (momsintofitness.com) which clearly indicates which workout to try each day and when to rest (5 days of workouts followed by 2 days of rest). This is helpful because there is no guesswork and ensures you follow a safe regimen where you don't work out the same muscles too many days in a row.
I should mention that I have the moms into fitness app and actually use the downloads that came free with the DVD when I purchased it through moms into fitness. I love the app for many reasons. Firstly, I can download or stream the workouts on my iPad. Secondly, I downloaded the calendar onto my phone using the app and it allows you to choose your start date so now my phone calendar and to do list show which workouts to do every day. There is also a progress feature where you can record your measurements and weight when you start and as you progress through the program. There is also a food tracker which I do not use because I have another app which I find easier to navigate for the purpose of tracking food consumption each day. If you have an iPad or tablet that can accommodate the app, I recommend you purchase this workout that way (the app is free then you pay for the workout) but otherwise I highly recommend this DVD.
I will post an update in a few weeks when I hopefully have some weight loss progress to report!",1444435200,3,2399,4.381165919282512
7425480,5,B0152197H8,"I never thought I'd give this 5 stars on week one, but I think I'd give it 6 stars after week 2. I feel so strong, my whole body feels strong!
I'm an avid at home workout person. I have it all, cardio-dance to barre-yoga- to weight lifting. I like to workout.. at home.. with DVDs.

What I love about this set of workouts is I love that every workout is .. maybe the word is 'similar' but different enough, I feel like every workout is a whole new workout.
I feel strong, and every imaginable angle of my core has been hit!! Love it!

after the full 30 days.. I love how strong I feel, I realize now my other workouts did not work on my lower back like Lindsay does.  I had a little bit of muffin top before.. and my lower back, sides really bothered me more than my stomach.  This has really toned that area so that doesn't bother me anymore.  I also feel like it's helped my posture.  I always assumed my upper back/shoulders were what I needed to work on for better posture, but I realize now my lower back needed strengthening.
There's no one magical move or magical workout to get these types of results, Lindsay has a good combination here that works! cardio/strength/toning/flexibility.",1499904000,,1193,4.375565610859729

I love that she's a mom a speaks specifically to our challenges with time etc.  She's very encouraging.  Most importantly this is EFFECTIVE! My abs are stronger.  I have more work to do, but I'm well on my way and I'm sticking with Lindsay!",1498694400,,387,4.380281690140845

7425484,3,B0152197H8,"Since this is marketed toward new moms, I bought this hoping it would start out at an easier pace. My core is very weak, and I have back pain and muscle spasms because of it. I had hoped that this would help strengthen those muscles to help my back. But, I can't do many of the exercises, and when I can, explanations and transitions are too fast for me to change positions. For someone in better shape and without back pain, this will be great. I just have more work to do before I can even attempt it, and I wish I had known how difficult it would be for me before purchasing.",1493078400,6,578,4.123893805309734

7425486,5,B0152197H8,"I'm a huge Lindsay Brin fan. And this is another great workout video.

After gaining so much pregnancy weight, I could not wait for my 6 week postpartum doctor's okay to start exercising. I was planning to hit the gym, but realized how hard it was to leave my baby. That's when I discovered Lindsay. I love that she has different workouts on the dvd so I won't get bored and she provides a calendar so I don't have to think about which workout to do each day. Her workouts are short and effective. Knowing that she is gearing the workout for moms to get back into shape keeps me motivated. And of course the results keeps me coming back for more. I have almost all her workout dvds and have using them for 5 years to keep me in shape.",1492819200,,734,4.205673758865248
7425487,5,B0152197H8,"I have quite a few Lindsay Brin workout DVDs. I really like this Core work out. I started using it after an extended break from working out (6 months) in order to get my core strength back which I did. Some of the work outs/exercises really strained my shoulders though so I wouldn't recommend it if you have any shoulder issues (lots of planking and similar exercises in these work outs). I like that there are so many different workouts included with the DVD as well as the 30 day calendar and all the bonuses you get once you buy (meal plans, calendar, etc). This work out program is also nice as you don't need additional equipment.",1492646400,,636,4.444444444444445
7425488,5,B0152197H8,"This is a great workout if you're looking for a routine that is manageable, and not so intense that you're ready to drop when you're done. Lindsay provides easy-to-follow instructions, as well as modifications for every move: There is a modification for beginners, those that have been working out for awhile, and there is also an in-between.  Or if you're like me, choose multiple intensity levels throughout each workout.  It's whatever works for YOUR body.  Even doing the modifications, I'm getting a good sweat, and come away feeling refreshed and worked.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS WORKOUT FOR ANYONE, MOM OR NOT!!!",1492473600,,619,5.099009900990099
7425489,5,B0152197H8,"I LOVE this workout! Lindsay has helped me almost completely repair my severe recti distastes after five kids (including one set of twins) something my doctor said could only be repaired by major surgery. This is my third workout of hers and it is my favorite, I am just about to finish my first 30 days and then I will move onto her more advance workouts. She is so motivating...I have to say I'm addicted to working out again all thanks to Lindsay. I have only seen but can feel the results and my hubby compliments my progress all the time, I'm going to stick with Lindsay with the hopes of getting my pre babies body back!",1490313600,,626,4.358974358974359

7425491,5,B0152197H8,"Only through the first DVD and I already love this! The instructor is very attentive and describes everything with clarity. She often stops to remind you about form and introduce modified routines if necessary. In some of the videos she has two other ladies behind her - one doing an ""easy"" version of the routine and the other performing more challenging versions. (With weights, more reps, etc) ... so you can follow easily. I love that these girls are moms and that she seems to have a great attitude about fitness. Highly recommended!!",1488240000,,539,4.806451612903226

7425493,5,B0152197H8,"I've done a lot of workout videos in the past, but Lindsay's programs are something I have stuck with for 3 years now. I have multiple workout programs from Lindsay Brinn and love them all. She has taken me from postpartum to best shape of my life twice now after each of my kids- In just 30 minutes a day, cause we are all busy moms! 30 day core has been an awesome follow up to postpartum slim down. I healed up my diastasis recti after pregnancy first by following postpartum slim down, and then started 30 day core. I am on day 21 of 30 day core and yesterday my hubby noticed my great abs! It is possible to get in great shape after babies! I especially appreciate Lindsay's real life encouragement - we are not all going to be the same shape or weight, and its not all about how our body looks. Motivation to keep working out comes from wanting to keep up with my active family, live life pain free, and feel great and strong about myself no matter what the scale says. Lindsay is my favorite workout coach ever!",1486512000,,1018,4.252577319587629
7425494,5,B0152197H8,"A friend introduced me to Lindsay Brin's Moms Into Fitness videos and i am so glad that she did!  I did the 30 day core (streaming option) in September.  I did not do the meal plan (although i did cut back and focus on nutrition in other ways) and i lost an inch in my waist!  below my belly button in that hard-to-lost, ""mama belly"" place!  I was thrilled with the results.  But even besides the results, i just really like the videos, too.  I found them motivating and i really loved having a schedule that told me what to do and when.  She packs a lot into the 25 minutes, which i really appreciate.  I really feel like I'm making the most out of the short amount of time i'm devoting to it each day.

7425500,5,B0152197H8,Great workout program! I love Lindsay Brin and all of her workouts! She helped me get my core back in shape after having 5 kids in 6 years time which left me with diastasis recti.

I love that the works outs are fast, but they really give you a good workout. I can do them during nap time or while the kids sleep at nignt, it's the best way to stay on track for a busy mom. I've used Lindsay's workout videos for 5 years now and I must say, I never get sick of them. When the weather is nicer, I get to run outside and then throw a workout in here and there when I want to change it up.

7425505,5,B0152197H8,"Written by wife.

I love Lindsay Brin's work outs.  Before this I also had and used her postnatal slim down and some of her pretty fierce lean out.  I was very excited to hear about this new video since my core was where I wanted to focus after having 3 kids.

I love that the videos are 30 minutes.  It makes it easy for me to get done.  When my youngest took 2 naps I use to do it during her morning nap, but now I get up in the early morning and get it done.  I love the feeling that I have after I complete my daily exercise

I have completed 30 day core 3xs and each time I lost inches and toned up.

This is a great video for beginners or more advanced exercisers.

If you follow the calender and give it your all you will see some results",1485907200,2,745,3.8741721854304636

It is short, fun and intense.... I am really bad at getting up in the mornings but in this 30 day I did it this way... And it wasn't even so hard
She is motivating and you see results fast!!
Of course you need to diet a bit, but doing the workouts your anxiety towards food decrease a lot and makes it easier.

I followed the meal plan and 30 day core calendar with this DVD and saw results within the first two weeks. It's challenging enough to make you work, but she changes the movements every minute, which I find motivating. It doesn't overwhelm you, but definitely pushes you. The cardio will make you sweat! But it totally makes the fat melt off quickly. (I feel so accomplished after I finish that cardio, let me tell ya!) I have been a Lindsay fan for years, ever since I got one of her pregnancy DVD's.

After not being able to walk, sit or stand without severe pain in over a year, I have been given two months ""off"" from pain. I have used this time to get back into fitness with this workout plan.

I love to know each day what I am supposed to eat and what workout to do. There is no guess work and it's made specifically for moms! I could go on and on.",1475452800,,558,4.081818181818182

I love the fact that she puts the time and effort with the research and study she does for her fitness programs - she truly understands how a woman's body reacts and bounces back from being pregnant (in her case, 3 times). She relates to every mom out there with her no fuss meal plans that take the guess work out of ""what should I be eating?"". She understands that you don't have the time to workout for an hour every day and the 30 DC workouts are usually no longer that 30 minutes - but believe me (I am an advanced, avid exerciser) they get the job done! - ( she does, as in all her fitness videos, have someone who modifies each move or she will show a modification of it herself)  I have yet to do a workout program of hers that I do not enjoy so if you like this one be sure to check out her others -they are awesome too!",1474243200,,854,4.023529411764706

7425527,5,B0152197H8,"I was a big time skeptic at first. Knowing my track record with workout DVD's I didn't think I would last for more than a week. Heck, my husband didn't think I'd last either, but here I am, almost at the completion of my fourth week and ready for another round. The first day I started I said oh these exercises aren't that bad, but boy let me tell you, that very evening I had muscle pains I didn't even know were humanly possible. Every day, I would wake up and push myself, with the encouragement of Lindsay as well as Amy and Adrianne, it made me motivated to keep going. I hate working out, but Lindsay makes it easy with the calendar that shows what you need to do and how long it is. I haven't been keeping track of measurements but I can physically see the change and I sleep much better at night. I must admit, even after doing this for 4 weeks I am still sweating balls and pushing myself to finish. This isn't easy, your muscles ache after each session, you know it is working. I am not where I want to be but like all things it takes time and dedication, you're not going to get rock hard abs in 30 days, but you will feel 100% stronger trust me. The more time you put in and the longer you do 30-day core, you will see a huge difference. I will be following the advance calendar next, then the
pretty fierce and lean workout. I am so grateful to have found a workout that works and I want to do it! I am not forcing myself to wake up to workout. I literally get up, get it done, shower, and go about my day. I wish I would have know about this 3 years ago, but now is better than never. Thank you, Lindsay, for motivating me, I find myself pulling up my shirt every day just to see my stomach, it's an awesome feeling! I can't wait to get those abs that I used to have and now I know I am on the path to do with your workouts. So guys, what are you waiting for?! Buy this now!

I'm somebody that has worked out for years and can definitely say this ab workout is a challenge. The workouts are great too because they are only 1/2 hour long so easy to squeeze into a busy day and if you want to add more you can by just playing it again and doing another round.

7425546,5,B0152197H8,"If you're like me, you have a graveyard of fitness DVDs -- the ones you bought, were so excited about, and planned to do until you got the results on the cover... for a while. Then, life creeps in, you get discouraged, you say ""I'll do it tomorrow,"" there's too much wasted time, all the excuses.

Enter Lindsay Brin and Moms Into Fitness. For the first time in my life, I have used and more importantly, GOTTEN GREAT RESULTS FROM, a fitness DVD. I'm almost through my first round of 30 Day Core, and I can really see a difference. My husband can too, and he keeps telling me how great I look. But that's not my favorite part: this exercise TRULY makes me feel better. I have so much more energy, and a mush more positive outlook on life, because I am taking this time for myself and my fitness. Pre-kids, I ran half marathons and even did a triathlon. Lindsay's DVDs (I've also done a couple rounds of Postnatal Slimdown) are better workouts, and help me look better an feel better, than all that training I did. Lindsay addresses and solves every problem I've ever had with a fitness DVD.
1. A plan. She gives you a workout calendar to follow. This works great for me! I NEED that, I'm not one of those people who sticks to workout schedules I create for myself. I have the best intentions, but I really need it spelled out for me what to do, when.
2. She doesn't waste your time. Lindsay crams all the work into around 30 minutes or less. I don't have time for more. Also I don't get bored like I would with a longer DVD.
3. Support. I enjoy and look forward to Lindsay's encouraging emails. She's super sweet and relatable. I feel like I have a trainer. I even talk about her to my mom, ha ha.
4. I also love that she has running calendars. I really haven't been running much between pregnancy and postpartum but I really would like to get back to it. Plus, you can work out with the kids and you can't beat that.
5. I love how she provides modifications and lots of coaching on form. If I'm feeling tired (my baby isn't a good sleeper), I just take it easier that day. And I always, always feel better after.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to finally find an exercise program that works! All fitness levels could find something here. Try it!",1461715200,4,2262,4.297423887587822

7425550,5,B0152197H8,"I am a new Lindsay Brin fan after purchasing this program... and it is that, a complete workout and nutritional program. Everything about this system is so thoughtful. The workouts, in my opinion, are organized in such a way to build in difficulty from weeks 1&2 to weeks 3&4. It is the first at-home program I have done and not suffered some type of injury. Lindsay is VERY focused on emphasizing proper form and I never get tired of her reminders to ""pull in the T.A.(lower abs)"" because she seems to know exactly when I may be fatiguing and/or compromising form. The workouts are tough, but doable. There are days when I do fewer reps or follow the easier modifications (there are two moms assisting Linday, one doing a more advanced version of the move, and one doing an easier modification), but I always feel I have gotten a great workout. I love the countdown clocks in many of the routines, which often push me to finish the set. It has been an empowering journey strengthening my core with Lindsay. It has improved all aspects of my other workouts. I am running faster and stronger and I am doing more challenging 1-minute HIIT intervals between my weight-training sets at the gym (I incorporated moves from Lindsay's video into my workout). I prefer variety, so I did the complete 1-month program once and may revisit it in the future. For now, I am using some of the individual workouts a few times per week, along with other workouts.

THE SURPRISE BONUS: I had no idea how amazing the mix&match meal plan would be. It is not a diet, it is a way to eat healthy for life. This plan was so obviously developed for busy moms. There are many many ways to mix and match meals depending on how much time you have and whether or not you wish to cook. Nothing is overly complicated or requires unusual or expensive ingredients. And this is the first meal plan I have seen that includes SO MANY options. I've always wanted a meal plan that was simple, yet comprehensive, and Lindsay delivered.",1460592000,8,1996,4.559888579387187

The workouts are not very long and easy to squeeze into any schedule. The modifications are perfect for the unconditioned as well! If you have trouble doing any of the exercises and you simply keep at it (with proper form of course ) you'll be amazed at how quickly you get into shape. I have a terrible lower back since having my second child and these workouts helped me more than I can say. In addition, if you are extremely conditioned, the advanced modifications are for you!

Lindsay does a nice job of balancing pushing yourself and ""doing what you can"" in her talk as she goes. The meal plan is good and easy to follow, even with a gluten restriction.

Lindsay offers such a wide variety of plans to follow with each program, so you can reuse them time and again, but challenge yourself in different ways. Lindsay is clear in her direction and wonderfully encouraging. I love popping in a DVD each day and doing something for me.

My core naturally is really good, and so I didn't think I would really get measurable changes since I'd already tightened up quite a bit again after my pregnancy. However, I lost inches on my waist and abs too and my core is even stronger than before! For an overall body workout I think that the Pretty Fierce program pushes other areas a bit better (I'm looking forward to doing her Lean Out series next), but you still get a great total body workout doing the 30 Day Core program.

Everyone followed the 30 Day Core calendar that comes with the DVDs and checked in with her when they finished the workout each day. I followed the basic 30 Day Core calendar, there was also an Advanced option but I didn't think I was on that level yet. The accountability factor was amazing and really helped me to stick to it!  The videos are all around 30 minutes. I was able to establish a little routine at home. I wake up and workout, shower, get dressed, and feed myself- all before my little one wakes up!! At the beginning of 30 days, I could not even straighten my legs all the way to do the scissor kicks and by the end I could straighten and hover my legs really close to the ground! I lost about 5 lbs and some serious inches around my waist! I would definitely recommend any of her workouts after baby. She really focuses on the mother's body and what we went through while carrying babies and all of her moves really help with that lower pooch that I developed. I'm posting my results picture! My favorite is the difference you can see in my waist from the back. I think I'm going to try her Pretty Fierce Weight Loss next! To summarize: I LOVE LINDSAY BRIN'S MOMS INTO FITNESS 30 DAY CORE!",1457136000,12,1325,4.317269076305221

7425568,5,B0152197H8,This is the best core workout I have ever used. Lindsay is knowledgeable about the underlying structures and muscles in the core and does a fabulous job of coordinating the proper workouts to achieve that flat tummy! I have a better core now than I did before having my 2 kids! Amazing!,1456876800,,286,4.519230769230769

7425571,5,B0152197H8,"This is a must have DVD!!!!  It is challenging, has a variety of workouts, and really brings back your core-probably better than it was before!  Lindsay's attention to proper posture and frequent cues to keep your form set this DVD apart!  Definitely worth the time and money!  In fact, I have many of her workouts and LOVE them all!  As a swimmer, runner and physical therapist, her workouts have gotten me in the best shape since having my three kids!",1456704000,,453,4.6125

7425575,5,B0152197H8,I love Lindsay Brin and have most of her DVD and this one doesn't disappoint. I love her upbeat  attitude. The exercises are great. Challenging and doable and the longest segment is about 40 minutes I believe. It has definitely made my core stronger.,1456617600,,250,4.681818181818182
7425576,5,B0152197H8,"Love, love, love this work out & Lindsay is great. I am a physiotherapist but on maternity leave with baby number 2. Never lost the last 10lbs from my first baby. I have chronic low back pain & the last month of pregnancy was pretty bad in this regard. I was very leary to do too much & aggravate my back. I started with postnatal slimdown then tried 30 day core workout at 6 months post partum. Amazing!! No back pain doing exercises due to great education and motivation throughout the dvd. No back pain picking up my heavy baby (when with baby number 1, I had a flare up when my daughter was 6 months old). My core is so much stronger, I have lost stubborn inches around my butt, hips & waist. I am so excited to move onto the pretty fierce work outs. I recommend,  not only as a busy mom that found time to do these exercises daily but also as a physiotherapist promoting a safe, educational & effective training method post partum. Thanks Lindsay, keep up the great work!",1456531200,,976,4.304347826086956
7425577,5,B0152197H8,Absolutely love all of her videos but this one might be my favorite. They are 30 minutes which is great for a mom of 2 kids. You don't do the same thing everyday. Buy the video,1456531200,,176,3.9166666666666665
7425578,5,B0152197H8,"Another great program from Lindsay Brin!  I found Lindsay three years ago when researching what to do for diastasis recti.  I started with her Pretty Fierce Weight Loss and Lean Out programs and have been sold ever since.  I just completed 30 Day Core and am very happy with my results, despite mediocre nutrition on my part.  I get bored easily with programs that repeat workouts very often, and I admit I was getting there at the end of week three.  But, I stuck with it, and I'm so glad I did!  I feel like my core is stronger, and I can actually SEE a difference.  The workouts are quick and effective, and I plan to rotate them into my fitness regimen.",1456531200,,657,4.336065573770492
7425579,5,B0152197H8,I've done just about all of Lindsay Brin's workouts and this one is a staple for me. The length of the workouts are under 30 minutes and it's challenging so I feel like I made the most of my time. Ive had positive improvements in strengthening my core and have moved on to pretty fierce weight lose since this video. These workouts are good for someone just starting and someone who is more advanced!,1456531200,,400,4.418918918918919

7425581,5,B0152197H8,"As with all other Moms into Fitness programs I've purchased, 30 Day Core is challenging, fits in with my busy mom schedule, and provides awesome results. The workout calendar takes all the guesswork out of working out and allows me to spend more time with my kids.",1456531200,,264,4.638297872340425
7425582,5,B0152197H8,"Just yesterday I finished the 30 Day Core Workout. I lived it! The workouts were challenging and sometimes i had to slow down or take a break, but I felt the improvement in what I was able to do. After completing this workout I feel so much stronger. Lindsay Brin is my favorite to workout with because she is upbeat, motivating, and classy. I've learned more about proper form with her videos than with any others I've watched. I love it all!",1456531200,,443,4.414634146341464
7425583,5,B0152197H8,"Loved 30 Day Core!  This is my third MOF purchase, and I've loved everyone one.  I started with PF Weight Loss and then went to PF Lean Out.  I knew I needed something else to keep momentum going with my workouts so I was very glad when 30 day core was released.  I like it as a maintenance video to switch things up between the 8 week PF videos.",1456531200,,346,3.971014492753623
7425584,5,B0152197H8,"The workouts, when paired with the nutrition plan, are very effective for any fitness level. Lindsay Brin knows her stuff, and I find her and the Moms Into Fitness staff to be open, approachable, an helpful. If you have a question, email them! They'll respond. Need help with nutrition? They have nutritionists on staff to help you get your diet in check. The workouts are short and straight-forward. I followed the nutrition plan very closely and had excellent results. Granted, I *was* grumpy for the first 2 weeks while I got my diet in check, but after that it got a lot easier, and I've continued to use the lessons learned during the 30 Day Core program to keep the scale from creeping back up. I've recommended it to several friends, and it's currently out on loan now!",1456531200,,776,4.630434782608695
7425585,4,B0152197H8,"I bought this workout in the app form!
I had software difficulties and could not download all the exercises. Then I realized some workouts were the same except that they added some extra features. In my opinion, this workout was a little over prized. There were repetitive exercise videos which I think could have been narrowed down to 3 or 4 videos. However, the exercises are awesome. MIF videos are my favorite. I see results if I follow a well balanced diet. I would recomend subscribing to the MIF streaming workouts for $9.99 I believe. It's worth more bc you can choose 30 day core and all the others videos as well plus you can cancel anytime. I love Lindsay Brin.",1456531200,2,672,4.56198347107438
7425586,4,B0152197H8,"I love 30 day core! It is easy to follow and fun! I started when I was about 6 months post partum and have already seen a difference in my abdominal muscle strength, I had a small separation after my third pregnancy and started doing her post natal program around 4 months and by the time I went in for my 6 mo check up, my midwife said it had fully healed! I love Lindsey's philosophy and how she incorporates her faith into what she does! This is a great program and it is easy to customize to your ability.",1456531200,,509,4.1
7425587,5,B0152197H8,"I'm a huge fan of Lindsey's workouts. I purchased her prenatal workouts and loved them. When this new workout came out I had to get it. I started in on it when it was safe to do so after my son was born.
I had been working out regularly before pregnancy and throughout my entire pregnancy.  I found it challenging and extremely effective. After I finished the 30 days I could tell a noticeable difference in how strong my abdominals were. It was a great foundation dvd. Since then I've moved onto more challenging workouts but know that I wouldnt have been strong enough for them if I hadn't first started with this.
What I liked about this workout is that she incorporates all the necessary components of a good workout. I felt the burn in the core exercises, burn and strength in the strength portions and sweated it out in the cardio.
Lindsey is motivational without being a nagging trainer. She is encouraging and kind. I can feel the love through the screen. ",1456531200,,964,4.5344827586206895
7425588,5,B0152197H8,This program is nothing short of fantastic! I started using Lindsay's programs after having 3 kids in 3.5 years (during which time I slowly stopped exercising altogether). She got me back on the proverbial horse and two years on I'm still sitting high! This program and the different schedules that go with it can be wedged into any busy mom's life and it works! It is worth purchasing it.,1456531200,,389,4.6521739130434785
7425589,5,B0152197H8,30 Day Core is the fifth workout DVD program that I have completed by Lindsay Brin! I LOVE it!! I have been doing her workouts daily for a year and a half and 30 Day Core helped me discover some abdominal muscles I didn't know I had! Love the calendar that comes with it so there is no guess work about which workout to do. Another plus for me is that the workouts are each 30 minutes or less so you can fit them in to your schedule! Another great workout by Lindsay Brin and Moms Into Fitness!,1456444800,2,494,4.051020408163265
7425590,5,B0152197H8,"I have been using Lindsay's DVDs since having my first baby in 2009. I personally feel like Linsday is a mastermind. Her unique exercises have toned up my body in ways I did not know were possible. I highly recommend her 30 day core DVD if you are looking to increase your core strength. shred fat, and see ab definition. In this past year I completely my personal training certification and appreciate that Linsday's workouts and information are spot on with what I learned in my certification course.",1456444800,,502,4.715909090909091
7425591,5,B0152197H8,"I love everything Lindsay comes out with, and this program was no exception! Her methods are the best I've ever tried, and when you follow her guidelines its pretty much a guarantee you'll get awesome results. I'm in the best shape of my life after 2 kids and losing more than 30 lbs after my first baby. She's inspiring and so fun to watch and follow along with! I've done her Pretty Fierce: Weight Loss, Lean out and PF: X programs before this one, as well as her pregnancy fitness DVDs. I've loved every single one!",1456444800,,518,4.40625
7425592,5,B0152197H8,"I seriously love anything Lindsay puts out.  I have 4 of her programs and each one has been so great.  This was my latest purchase after finishing her Pretty Fierce Lean Out program.  I love the focus on the core but appreciate that she still does strength training and full body workouts.  I just finished the 30 days and my core feels strong and fit.  I didn't do the meal plan when doing this program, but I know if I had I would have lost inches off my waist and gotten even more from the workouts.

She provides 3 different calendars to follow too, based on your abilities.  She even had a Pretty Fierce hybrid calendar for all of us ladies that have done her Fierce DVDs.  As always, Lindsay's DVD did not disappoint.  Love her!",1456444800,,734,4.338235294117647
7425593,5,B0152197H8,"Another winner from Lindsay. I have several of her videos, and with the help of her Post-Natal Slimdown, I was down to my pre-preg weight in 3 months and Closed the minimal diastasis rectii that I had. I tried this video when my son was 4 months old. I didn't follow a meal plan, and honestly, I could have eaten better. I still lost .75 inches around my waist. It was challenging but not overly so. I'm an advanced exerciser, and I think I'm going to try the hybrid 30 day challenge next. That's what I love about Lindsay's workouts - options in a quick, efficient workout. There's new moves not seen elsewhere in all of her videos, and they are effective!",1456444800,12,657,4.39344262295082
7425594,5,B0152197H8,"I'm a Lindsay Brin fan - I think I own most of her DVDs and love them all. I previously had my best results ever using her Pretty Fierce Weight Loss series. Moms Into Fitness asked me to help with Research and Development for the 30 Day Core. In two weeks I lost 4lbs and 7"". The workouts are short and fun, with a lot of kickboxing moves. The nutrition aspect is important to good results! I like that it's a short program, and I can add in the workouts whenever i need a kickstart or just looking for something fun.",1456444800,,517,4.128712871287129

7425596,5,B0152197H8,There are a lot of programs out there with crazy claims. This one actually does what it says and is actually do-able for a mom. I am not your typical gym seasoned person. I am a mom who wants to be toned so I can go about the rest of my day and feel great. These workouts are easy to fit in and do not leave me panting on the floor afterwards. And I actually have abs. WHAT? Abs after baby???? I've never had toned abs in my life!,1456444800,2,430,3.842696629213483
7425597,5,B0152197H8,"Love Lindsay Brin's Core workout. Quick, intense and effective. I have felt muscle I didn't know existed and her exercises reach areas we all struggle to firm up like the lower abs. These work outs allow me to get it done and return to being a mom to my 3 year old and twin 9 month olds. I also love that the core workouts are something I can easily add to my running routines as well.",1456444800,,385,4.078947368421052
7425598,5,B0152197H8,"I need to write a longer review of the DVDs and workouts that I have tried, but I will suffice it to say I am in love with MIF! I was a regular half marathon runner before trying to find some crosstraining that would really help my core and tummy after having 3 kiddos. I found MIF and it has been such a blessing to me. I started with Lean Out and this was perfect for a time when we were moving. Having a schedule kept me sane and accountable as I packed up our house, and my newfound muscles were a lifesaver as my husband and I pretty much moved our house slowly into storage. I was amazed that my back didn't hurt after this endeavor, unlike my poor husband who tweaked his back during the move. Fast forward to pre-ordering 30 day core and starting a new calendar after Lean Out. The hubby, who is a competitive cyclist and in amazing shape, joined in to help his back. And he is convinced 30 day core completely fixed an old cycling back injury that flares up from time to time! I was amazed to see 1 inch come off my waist and 2 inches below my waist. This is especially hard on my petite frame! I am now on my 3rd round of 30 day core- and still loving it! My 2 daughters and 1 son love to join in, ""Lindsay"" is truly a household name around here.",1456444800,,1256,4.048192771084337
7425599,5,B0152197H8,"I only did the videos and did not follow the diet plan that went with it and lost 4 pounds in 4 weeks.  If I actually followed the program, there is no doubt I would have lost more weight. Since having my son a year ago, I  have lost almost 20 pounds using postpartum slimdown, pretty fierce weight loss, and now 30 day core. My favorite thing about Lindsay Brin's programs is that each one have multiple workouts that target different areas each day and have a nice mix of weights and cardio. The calendars are also wonderful and really help me keep on track. I highly recommend this program!",1456444800,,593,4.381818181818182

I have to admit - at first I was intimidated, but I really felt stronger with each day and noticed I could do more. And I could ""feel"" my core getting a workout. I just love that her workouts are less than 30 minutes - so hard to find time, but this is manageable. Great home video - love MIF.",1456444800,,481,4.073684210526316

It was secretly more difficult than I thought. Pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a month of crunches/bicycles. And that it's really your whole body, too. She (along with her meal plan) helped me get rid of my 'mommy tummy' post-baby with her Pretty Fierce weight loss, so naturally I wanted to do 30 day core, too.

Because of that it lead to the purchase of her other programs from her Pretty Fierce Weight Loss, Pretty Fierce Lean Out, and Pretty Fierce X.  I have been hooked ever since and was so excited when she came out with her 30 Day Core.  Her workout have always been to the point without the extra fluff. The time it takes to do a workout is great because it doesn't take a huge chunk of your time, and you can get back to you day feeling better then ever.  I love how she explains the muscles that you are working and why it is helpful and I love the other resources you have access to.  I highly recommend 30 Day Core!",1456444800,,817,4.1069182389937104

All workouts are designed to be able to fit into your already busy schedule. Lindsay is motivating and so sweet. Her pregnancy series are wonderful too.

The production is good (better than her earlier videos which I also love) and Lindsey is so likable.  While this is a core focused series, you get a full body workout and cardio.  I am really enjoying the 30 Day Core calendar.  It helps to keep the workout fresh so you're not doing the same thing day after day, getting bored.",1456444800,,499,4.25531914893617
7425618,5,B0152197H8,I have two days left to finish 30 Day Core. I have followed through with every workout accept 1 (I was super sick). I love the energy of the videos and Lyndsay's attitude. A workout video is a good one for me when it has me keep coming back and this one does it for me. I am looking forward to trying out her Pretty Fierce line.,1456444800,,328,3.91044776119403
7425619,5,B0152197H8,"This is an excellent DVD! It's labeled as a core workout but really works the whole body and improves your cardiovascular endurance. I viewed it as an all-around workout with special focus on the core, therefore toning the whole body while honing in on trouble areas.

It comes with a 30 day calendar and nutrition plan that you receive in your email. The workout plugs in to her free MIF app, helping keep you accountable.

This can really be used at any level of fitness, as Brin offers two to three different levels of intensity every workout. There are even separate ""advanced"" workouts for when you complete the 30 day calendar and want to go for round two.

No complaints about this work out. It got me in shape after my second baby and I've now moved on to her Fierce DVDs after two rounds of 30 Day Core.",1453420800,3,812,4.436241610738255

8732344,4,B0152197H8,Love all Lindsays workouts! Helped me get my abdominal strength back after baby :-),1531958400,,83,5.0
8732345,5,B0152197H8,This work out was a great way to jumpstart my motivation after being inactive for a little while. It is easy to work into my day and there is enough variation to make it interesting. It is also a workout that I can go back to at a greater level. I truly enjoy Lindsays blog as well. She keeps things simple. I found Moms Into Fitness when I was pregnant six years ago and loved it. I have recently started the Pretty Fierce Weight Loss. I can already tell it is a good one too.,1530489600,,477,4.031578947368421
8732346,5,B0152197H8,This was a great workout for a busy working mom! I definitely saw results within the first couple of weeks. Lindsay Brin keeps it fun even while pushing you to do more.,1524182400,,168,4.28125
8732347,5,B0152197H8,needed a fresh set of workouts for home and these are perfect-- all about 30 min. and really provide good cardio/core exercise.  lindsay is upbeat and instructs well.  have the bootcamp set from her also.  i think these are a little tougher-- but maybe because its so focused on core areas.,1520467200,,290,4.647058823529412
8732348,4,B0152197H8,Great workout especially shred but I do not see as much result as with other videos including the slim down. Completed two times and see results in my legs but not the abs area.,1514851200,,177,4.235294117647059
8732349,5,B0152197H8,"I love Lindsay.  I do a lot of Beachbody workouts, but Lindsay helped me get back on my feet after both my pregnancies with her Bootcamp.  I was plateauing a bit, so I decided to come back to the woman who gets postpartum strength.  I love this workout series!!  It's quick and interesting.  And there's a running calendar available to switch to after finishing the first round!",1513641600,,378,4.582089552238806
8732350,5,B0152197H8,I love the workouts! They are easy and effective.,1506124800,,49,4.555555555555555
8732351,5,B0152197H8,"I've been doing Lindsay Brin workouts for 4 years now (including the prenatal DVD which is great if you're expecting)  and this is one of my favorite's of hers! The 30 day core has several different workouts, all challenging, but she keeps it entertaining and fun, and I almost never get discouraged! The included meal plan and calendar is key for me. I am not one that's good at picking and choosing workouts and sticking with it- I need a set calendar to tell me what do do each day, it's a great motivator for me. I'm finishing up my first round of 30 day core and I'm down a couple inches and a couple pounds. I plan on doing a second 30 day round of it!",1503014400,,658,4.181102362204724
8732352,5,B0152197H8,"I cannot say enough good things about her workouts and programs! I've hated ""working out"" and ""excersising"" my whole life. After my 2nd child I figured I needed to do something to loose the many pounds I gained. I did her postnatal slim down first (lost a TON of inches and pounds) and then this one after. I lost 2 inches on my belly and L. O.V.E. the Shred workout on this one (great workout for all over and especially the booty) Buy this workout and stick with it and you will feel great!!",1501545600,3,493,4.25531914893617
