4706979,5,B005HWAOH0,"WHAT AN AWESOME TEAM OF DETECTIVES; DICK VAN DYKE AND HIS REAL SON
BARRY (ONE A DOCTOR AND THE OTHER A POLICE DETECTIVE)! GOOD MURDER
MYSTERIES AND GREAT DETECTIVE WORK, ALMOST LIKE SHERLOCK HOLMES OR
JESSICA FLETCHER (MURDER SHE WROTE).  THE ONLY INCREDIBLE PART IS
HAVING AN MD, IN A HOSPITAL NO LESS, WITH ENOUGH FREE TIME
TO GO HUNTING BAD GUYS WITH A FELLOW DOCTOR AND THE POLICEMAN
SON.  REMOVE THE INCREDIBLE PART FROM YOUR MIND WHILE WATCHING,
AND IT IS A WONDERFUL AND DAMNED INTERESTING RIDE, GOING FROM ONE
CLUE TO ANOTHER, MOVING FAST FROM ONE THING TO ANOTHER.  OF THE
MYSTERY SERIES I LOVE THE MOST (COLOMBO, MURDER SHE WROTE, ROCKFORD
FILES, AND DIAGOSIS MURDER), DIAGNOSIS MURDER IS NOW MY FAVORITE,
BECAUSE OF THE GREAT RAPORT BETWEEN TRUE STARS, THE FASCINATING
MURDERS, AND  SURPRISE SOLUTIONS THEY COME UP WITH.  THE HOSPITAL
ADMINISTRATOR, A COOL ITALIAN NIT PICKER, WORRY WART, DEDICATED
BUREAUCRAT, AND STRAIGHT MAIN TO DICK VAN DYKE'S JOKES, GIVES
EACH EPISODE A TOUCH OF HUMOR.  LATER EPISODES HAVE AN ADDED
ATTRACTION; SCOTT BAIO, HANDSOME AND CLEVER AND SMART DETECTIVE
TOO!

4706980,5,B005HWAOH0,I have always loved Diagnosis Murder and I'm really glad this TV movie collection was finally released. When I was a kid I would get a bowl of popcorn and sit down and watch Dr. Sloan and the gang solve murders. This show really defined great Television in the 1990s and I wish they would release more seasons on DVD.,1349568000,,317,4.3
4706981,5,B005HWAOH0,I really enjoyed these movies. It is a shame the did not come out here in the USA. I was a fair price from overseas and very fast delevery.,1345593600,,139,3.8275862068965516
4706982,5,B005HWAOH0,Excellent TV!  Worth watching! People all over the world seem to like Diagnosis Murder and love Dick Van Dyke!  I just wish they'd release the other series on DVD!,1334793600,3,163,4.586206896551724
4706983,4,B005HWAOH0,"i am a huge fan of diagnosis murder, even ordered extra cable channels just to watch this show every week.  i was so excited when i saw this was supposedly coming out on dvd. i was hoping since this collection was on its way, that maybe the other seasons would be released as well. i tried to order this every time it was said to be coming out, with no success. very disappointed that it is still not available",1333497600,,410,4.189873417721519
4706984,5,B005HWAOH0,"A wonderful series, funny mystery, good dialogue, can sit when confined and enjoy for hours. Been waiting a long time for the rest of the series, so what is the problem?",1331164800,4,169,4.483870967741935
4706985,5,B005HWAOH0,"I really want this item to come out. all fans need to let VEI (Visual Entertainment Inc.) we want them to release the set. there worried there not going to make much money on this product. I am almost 19 years old and i grew up with this show and i was exited that this was being released. I was hoping if this set went over well, the other seasons would be released.",1328745600,30,367,4.041095890410959
4706986,5,B005HWAOH0,"At least, ""Yay!"" is what I thought when I saw this was going to be released... a couple months ago. I hope it's not a bad sign that it's due out in a few days and still has no image available.

But anyway. This is one of the greatest shows ever, and it's just wrong that they released 3 of 8 seasons and just stopped. We will hope that the fact that they are releasing these five movies means they will release the remaining seasons.

Out of the first three movies, ""Diagnosis of Murder,"" ""House on Sycamore Street,"" and ""Twist of the Knife,"" before the series started, I always enjoyed ""Twist of the Knife"" the most. I thought Suzanne Pleshette was such a cute match for Dick Van Dyke. As anyone who loved the show knows, they never got a girlfriend for Mark Sloan! Off the top of my head, there were 2 episodes that ended with ""let's try a relationship"" moments, but they never panned out. I guess Mark was just too busy being a doctor AND a detective.

After the series ended, they aired the final two movies, ""Town Without Pity"" and ""Without Warning."" ""Town Without Pity"" was excellent, even if it was heartbreaking. I think that one would have been an amazing finale. ""Without Warning,"" while good, was more like just a regular, average (though double-length) episode. But then again, maybe that's why they did it. After the sadness of the first one, everything needed to get back to normal.

I miss this show, and shows like it. Crime dramas today... all they do is butcher people so they can show off how great they are at analyzing microscopic DNA evidence. Before, they used their brains to solve crimes.

In the meantime, read Lee Goldberg's Diagnosis Murder novels. He was one of the writers for the show so they're pretty great.",1327708800,55,1740,4.528662420382165
4706987,3,B005HWAOH0,"I purchased the first three seasons of this outstanding series, and found it had no subtitles, neither the normal ones nor the hearing impaired type.",1320019200,5,149,5.0
4706988,5,B005HWAOH0,"Best actor in the world I am only 21 and he is my favorite and always will be; you will most likely remember him from his star roles in Marry Poppins(Bert the Chimney sweep) Chitty Chitty Bang Bang (Caractacus Potts a quarky inventer) and more recently Night at the Museum (in which he played one of the bad guys named Cecil). Diagnosis Murder is possibly the best mystery tv series ever created. A mixture between criminal minds, law and order and Bones this show is great for the whole family. Possibly one of the cleanest tv shows out there as well there are some instances where damn is used and a couple of sensual scenes in the whole series but other than that the show is just filled with murder mahem and a lot of action.",1316044800,40,729,4.367647058823529

4707026,5,B005HWAOH0,"This set includes three movies that predate the television series and two that conclude the series; this, in my opinion. makes watching them a necessity for all Diagnosis Murder fans.  If you are used to the series you'll notice the difference in characters and set up but that is typical for the transition from pilot to weekly episodes.  I think the character changes were good and made the series more cohesive but the movies are still entertaining.  The final two movies are much more like the series.  A Town Without Pity is heartrending and the characters experience more pain than usual; while Without Warning ends the series on a positive note for the Sloan family and the future of crime solving.  I wish they made series today with such likable characters.",1428537600,15,766,4.816793893129771

4707032,5,B005HWAOH0,"Always a favorite.  Dick Van Dyke and the rest of the cast really do a good job for a setting such as a hospital, to connect detective work with medicine.

4707057,3,B005HWAOH0,"It's okay. The supporting cast is entirely different and it's a bit jarring if you're a fan of the show but never saw these 90 minute mysteries before.

4707060,5,B005HWAOH0,"I bought this set for my husband and my daughter (and her family) who are both big fans of Dick Van Dyke and they thoroughly enjoyed watching the five movies.  I think the first three were made before the series of the same name and the last two after the series had ended at Series Eight.

The stories were great and there were some excellent guest stars - a bit of everything - humour, murder, mystery and mostly well acted.",1393632000,5,426,4.3125
4707061,4,B005HWAOH0,"I love this movie as it is what I call a ""gentle"" mystery. Along the lines of Murder She Wrote and Colombo, they open the movie showing you the murder and most of the clues. the events of which unfold as the story develops. The suspense is often found in the questioning of how it was done and by whom. And there is little blood and gore seen.  The only real drawback is the fact that Barry Van Dyke is not the actor his father is. He is stiff and at times awkward.",1393632000,2,465,4.0
4707062,4,B005HWAOH0,"My wife and I have not seen all of the five movies in the set yet, but we have liked what we have seen so far.  They do hold one's interest and keep the viewers wondering until the end who the murderer is  (too bad other Diagnosis Murder movies were not made).  I cannot, however, say that the full-length episodes were extraordinary in any particular way.  Like ""Murder, She Wrote"", I would definitely recommend this collection for the light-hearted suspense and how the stories are presented.",1393545600,2,494,4.709302325581396
4707073,5,B005HWAOH0,I am collecting the entire series.  The thought that it ran for 10 yrs while he was 65-75 yrs old is just amazing.  It is great evening entertainment with laughs.  Gotta love him.,1393372800,6,179,4.363636363636363

I wanted to give a review so that I could let anyone out there who is hearing-impaired (like me) a heads up concerning closed-captions and/or English subtitles.  The Product Details state that there are English and Spanish subtitles.  Sadly, there are no subtitles.  I was going to return it, but it would have cost almost half of what I paid for the movies to send it back to Canada.  Of course, if I had bought it directly from Amazon instead  of an Amazon Marketplace seller, I would have been able to return it for free.  Oh well, I will give the movie collection to my friend.

I am a deaf woman and I depend on these kind of things. I thought it was the law to have subtitles.

4707121,5,B005HWAOH0,"These movies show what made this a series and how a father and son can work together to find out the truth about murder.  The first three are before the series started and what made the series possible.  Each movie had great guest stars I especially liked seeing Bill Bixby and Ken Kerchival.  I really like the comedy used throughout and the mystery used to keep the audience guessing who did the killing up to the last possible second.  The bond between Dr. Mark Sloan and his son Detective Steve Sloan made for good drama also.  I really liked how Dick Van Dyke incorporated music and dancing to his character.  This is good for anyone who likes mystery, suspense and comedy.",1362096000,21,678,4.56198347107438

8473895,4,B005HWAOH0,"The television movie collection consists of three TV movies broadcast in 1992 and 1993 and two TV movies broadcast in 2002.  The first movie introduced Dr. Sloan (Dick Van Dyke), a roller skating, tap dancing, teacher of medicine.  Theres a murder.  The police naturally accuse the first person they set their sights on.  It doesnt matter that the real killer ran him over in the getaway car.  The police are portrayed as buffoons, led by their fearless leader Detective Sloan (Barry Van Dyke).  The son is rarely seen in this movie but when he is, he is depicted as an angry contentious idiot relying on his dad to solve the crime.  The highpoint is a chase sequence involving Dr. Sloan on roller skates.  In the second movie Dr. Sloan raps, dances, and solves another crime.  This episode is filled with nose jokes.  And his angry son is still just yelling, this is a part that anyone could have played.  The remainder of the movies are just longer versions of the TV series.  So if you liked the series, you will like the movies.",1510790400,,1032,4.579234972677596
