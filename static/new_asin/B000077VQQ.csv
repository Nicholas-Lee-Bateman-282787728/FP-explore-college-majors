1801729,3,B000077VQQ,"Michelle Lintel revisits her television role as the crime fighter Black Scorpion.  While this is a movie, it plays like three television episodes placed end to end.  The film opens with her undercover and running into another undercover cop.  The other cop becomes her new partner.  He transferred in specifically so he could catch Black Scorpion.
Black scorpion must first go up against Firearm, a villain with a gun for an arm.  He is after the mayor because of a gun bill that was passed.
Next Black Scorpion blinds a photographer who becomes Flashpoint, a villain bent on exposing Black Scorpions identity.
Finally she must go against Clockwise, a villain improperly jailed for twenty-five years.  Now that he is out he wants vengeance on all those who did him wrong (Frank Gorshin does an excellent job as this villain).
At the film's end, you do not feel like you have watched a movie, but a television show.  Nowhere near as good as the original film.  The fighting is more professional wrestling than martial arts and the banter, especially in the Firearm battles, is so bad you have to hear it.  Still, it is some reasonably good and fun crime fighting.",1078790400,13,1162,4.77
1801730,4,B000077VQQ,"This is the 3rd installment of the Black scorpion Movie series. First there was the ""The Black Scorpion and then there was B.S Part II (Aftershock). Out of the 3 I would have to say ""Aftershock"" still remains my favorite. ""Sting of the Black Scorpion"" is a 2002 Film....Also ""Michelle Lintel"" from the T.V series is the ""Black Scorpion"" not ""Joan Severance"" in this film. Although I thought Joan did better in the first two feature films conveying the part, Michelle definitley looks better. ""Sting"" is basically a reproduction of the first two films but is unconvincing. Why? because none of the same actors are in the film. To Replace one character is one thing, but to replace all is another. Even ""Arguile"" was a different actor her accompass. The only thing that was really a surprise in this film is that her ""Scorpion Mobile"" was destroyed and she got a New Model  White Corvette to roll with. And when it transformed,  the ""Scorpion Mobile"" was better equipped with a new look with some new tricks. Basically the story line was quite similiar to the previous two films. There was 3 villians in this film..FireArm, Clockwise & Blinder or something like that. Well anyway she had to defeat these guys before they took over ""The City Of Angels. The film is very Quirky as the others whre in the past. And offers alot of action comedy..which is definitley worth the purchase. You will laugh throughout this silly irony althrough this film. ""Roger Corman"" didn't fell on his attempt to reserect the movie franchise with this 3rd installment.

7974179,4,B000077VQQ,"This is a campy movie of a crime fighter who is also the police partner of a man who works with her everyday and can't recognize her with half a mask on. Michelle Lintel, an accomplished marshal arts fighter, stars in the title role. The film also use Frank Gorshin of Riddler fame to play one of the villains. The movie is fairly hokey, but a fun super hero watch.

It is rated ""R"" for brief nudity, something that I was looking for, but never saw. It does show plenty of cleavage and crotch shots.
