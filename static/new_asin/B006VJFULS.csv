5020767,4,B006VJFULS,"There were several parts that were probably inspired by The Time Machine by H.G. Wells.  The time machine was a window you can walk through, which was very interesting.",1360540800,2,168,4.793103448275862
5020768,5,B006VJFULS,"The Time Travelers has proven to be the best of classic '60's Sci Fi ""B"" pictures. We begin in the lab, where a team of scientists is beginning their experiment in time travel. They are able to see through time via the video screen connected to the Time Machine Computer Unit. However, they quite get ""ahead"" of themselves by setting the dials too high. They realize that they can physically step into the window and travel to the distant future! It's a one-way ticket to a post-apocalyptic world of mutants, androids and super-humans who seek to escape the dying planet for another (Via Rocketship). Of course, in the future, the super-humans are entertained with Light-Synth music that requires manual direction. However, the mutants are onto their escape plan! The scientists have to decide if they'll board the Rocket or just rock the Light-Synth.

Will the scientists ever return to 1964? Do they want to? Will the mutants discover the Rocket-based Light-Synth and destroy the world?

The Time Travelers is a must see for fans of time travel films/shows (The Time Tunnel!!!) as well as fans of '50's and '60's Sci Fi pictures (4D Man, The Incredible Shrinking Man, This Island Earth, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, The Day The Earth Stood Still).

5020769,5,B006VJFULS,"I remeber seeing this in the theaters, it blew me away, then it would come on the tv late nights....very watchable and a super ending, I cant wait for it to come out on dvd......please rescue this film",1294531200,2,201,4.315789473684211
5020770,3,B006VJFULS,"With its shameless bits of corny humor, weirdly discordant soundtrack, and all around goofiness, it is a little hard to take The Time Travelers seriously today.  If they ever bring back the old Saturday afternoon science fiction matinee on television, though, this film should definitely be in the rotation (although the similarity of the film's futuristic androids to adult blow-up dolls might be a problem).  The mutants of the future might have scared impressionable kids back in 1964, but nowadays they just look like poor imitations of that bald dude on the cover of the original The Hills Have Eyes.  As you might expect, this 1964 film does warn of a coming nuclear apocalypse brought on by the great folly of man, but that's nothing compared to the frightening vision of what passes for fashion in the wake of the destruction (the more important a man of the future is, the more he dresses like Liberace - sans all of the lace).

Here in the present (which is now, of course, the past) a team of scientists pursuing the holy grail of time travel push science - not to mention the electrical grid - to its boundaries, blowing the system up yet somehow managing to not only open up a window but a bona fide door into the future.  2071 has all the markings of a barren, lifeless world, but everyone in the lab stupidly steps through the time portal, anyway - led by electrician/comic relief Danny McKee (Steve Franken), who is basically in the wrong place at the wrong time.  Naturally, the unstable portal closes on them, leaving them running for their lives from a bunch of mutants (who carry sticks but never actually use them).  Fortunately for them, they are saved by the last remnants of human civilization, a small society of cave-dwelling scientists led by Dr. Varno (John Hoyt).  These people are busy building the dumbest-looking androids you'll ever see and preparing to launch themselves into space in search of a new Earth.  Eventually - after many a lame antic by designated funny man Danny, one supposedly erotic Lumichord  (a sort of color organ) performance by the only hot babe of the future (Delores Wells, who was Playboy Playmate of the Month June 1960), and a hilariously bad cameo by Forrest J. Ackerman, our gang of time refugees faces a crisis.  With the mutants on the brink of breaking into the cave structure, will they be allowed to board the spaceship, or will they try to construct a new time portal back to their own time - or will they be left there to die a most disagreeable death?

If you're looking for great special effects, you're definitely in the wrong place.  The overall cheapness of the whole production gives the film a certainly campy charm, but you can't help but laugh at much of what you'll see.  In all honesty, I can't really explain the fondness that a lot of fans have for The Time Travelers.  The acting is fine, but I don't find the story all that original or compelling.  The music is weird and oftentimes distracting, what with what I can only describe as cartoon music accompanying our visit to the android lab and some kind of quiet classical piece during what is supposed to be a central and heated scene near the end.  At least the ending actually works - although it didn't exactly blow me away (and I must admit that I don't understand why so many people seem to interpret it the way they do).

The Time Travelers is a good movie, and I enjoyed watching it - but I can't say it left a lasting impression on me.  It's rather obvious that those who remember seeing the film when it was first released in 1964 have a special fondness for it, but I don't think such a connection will be made with those just watching it for the first time here in the twenty-first century.  Still, I think we can all agree that this film is long overdue for a DVD release.",1278288000,,3819,4.571847507331379
5020771,3,B006VJFULS,"The Time Travellers is a somewhat predictable perhaps corny film that does nonetheless successfully illuminate common dilemmas incurred by the challenges of curiosity. Whether we risk by exploring or merely observing life while others make history is actually a daily current event. If we hire our heroes in society to 'professionally' lead, guide or entertain us we remove our involvement to directly change the world we know. Our lives are not what others decide but come out of how we interfere in what our leaders want! By altering the outcome of foolish destruction, the travellers save however few they can from certain death, to instead enter a distant future of restoration.

The use of what are essentially parlor tricks instead of the cheesy effects available at the time (watch the gasket scene and the transporter) was clever.  Delores Wells....what a knockout!

I got this as part of a Mill Creek set either their 1970's set or their 1980's set, probably the 70's set. It also appears on the Amazon streaming store. Either way, it's worth the watch. I am sure if you really wanted you could find it here on Amazon as well as a lone movie.

5020795,5,B006VJFULS,"It was fun to be able to find this out of print 1964 sci-fi ""B"" movie on Amazon Prime. It has an interesting premise of how a research team figures a way to explore the close future through a portal in their lab. But, as it always happens, something goes wrong & they somehow view a post atomic war, barren, future earth. Not only can they see that future, they can step through the lab's portal into that future. This where the adventure begins. Post war mutants, survivors, & androids, they're all there. Time Travelers has all the makings of classic mid 20th century science fiction.
Plus, look for the inventor of the phrase ""sci-fi,"" Forrest J. Ackerman in his first cameo guest appearance in film who is a technician making squares from circles. He has one line in the film where he makes a pun response to his ""supervisor"" in the film.
While the dialog is simple, & even humorous at times, with an occasional wink at the audience, this film was produced long before things such as CGI were invented. In fact it was time when computers were still nothing more than giant calculators. Which explains why the special effects in Time Travelers, for the most part, were actually magicians' illusions. A case in point is where the android has its head replaced on the lab table, (think of sawing a person in half). Or, the transported Danny McKee, (played by Steve Franken,) disappears off the rotating table only to reappear in another part of the room. There are a few more simpler illusions throughout the movie, but this why, in my opinion, is a classic. As infantile as some the illusions are, the effects where done on set & not animated in post production. However, there are a couple of  real ""special"" effects that I noticed & that's the green screen effects showing images in the portal  in the lab & from the desert side of the portal. Or in the cave scene. Also, check out the mat painting over the android assembly shop.
Time Travelers is a must see film for sci-fi buffs to see how far film, even this drive-in specialty, has come in the last 50 or so years. It's a ""B"" movie I'd like to give an ""A.""",1473292800,2,2115,4.490909090909091

5020809,4,B006VJFULS,"A crew of scientists in 1964 build a time portal. While testing it, the portal shows a barren land, rather than the usual view of the campus. One of the scientists cannot resist the urge to explore, and he climbs through the portal. A second scientist goes to find him, and soon, another follows him. The female scientist is left behind, trying to keep the portal open, when a savage enters the portal and tries to attack her. The entire crew ends up out in the new, barren world as the portal closes, leaving them stranded. A band of savages attacks them, and the scientists take shelter in a cave. There, they are rescued by yet another race of people.

This is a dated sci-fi movie, very typical of the others of its time.

5020838,4,B006VJFULS,"This is a good low budget science fiction film of ideas. A laser projected 3-D video screen accidentally becomes a time portal. Several scientists step through it into a little over 100 years in the future, where they find an Earth devastated by nuclear war, their university and lab gone, and the land overrun by wild mutants. The scientists find a group of technologically advanced people living underground, keeping the mutants out with force fields, and building robots to help them comstruct a massive rocket ship. These people have a robotic probe, similar to our present day Pathfinder robot, exploring one of the moons of the outer solar system looking for habitable planets. The future of humanity lies, they believe, in colonizing a different planet. With the time window they opened now closed, and their computers unreachable, can the scientists return to their own time to warn Earth of the approaching nuclear disaster? This film features a light and sound organ called the Lumichord designed by the great animator Oscar Fischinger. This is the first film shot by Cinematographer Vilmos Zsigmond, who went on to become cinematographer of Close Encounters Of The Third Kind and The Deer Hunter. The director Ib Melchior was responsible for several unusual low budget science fiction themed films of the time. He directed Angry Red Planet and cowrote scripts for Robinson Crusoe On Mars, Reptilicus, and Journey To The Seventh Planet, and wrote the screenplay for The Premonition episode of the TV show The Outer Limits. He created the Space Family Robinson, which became a comic book series, and claimed to have inspired the TV show Lost In Space, but he received no credit for that. Sure, The Time Travelers is limited by its low budget and perhaps aims a little low, but it compensates with interesting ideas. Traveling through a big screen 3-D TV to another time could be seen as similar to Doctor Who's Tardis, Doctor Who having hit British televisions the year before this film saw release.

In 1964, a team of scientists create a view screen to look into the future but what they get is in fact a portal to the future. as they slowly test the portal and venture out into it, they come to realize they are in fact 127 years into the future when the portal collapses. Earth of the future is barren and they are attacked by mutated humans. They are rescued by a group of scientists who are building a spaceship to take them to a new planet. They learn that much of Earth was destroyed as the result of a nuclear war. When they find out they cannot join them on the ship, they ask for help in constructing a new portal to return to their own time before the ship leaves. Always under constant attack from the mutants, They make friends with some of the scientist and they learn of life in the future using robots for basic tasks.",1455148800,,1145,4.070796460176991

Some elements of the film remind one of Planet of the Apes, which appeared four years later in 1968.  Use of benevolent androids as helpers is also interesting (similar to Data on Star Trek: The Next Generation).

Ending of the film is somewhat confused, though.  They could have gone back and simply destroyed the time machine, just in time to save the day.  Instead, they end up going through it again, and you spend another five minutes replaying the whole movie.  This is the only disappointing part.

A team of scientists in 1964 are developing a time portal. Pushing their equipment to the point of damage they see a wasteland where their university campus stands. Needless to say, the foolish young man of the group finds the window is a door and passes through. Eventually the other three individually go through to find each other. Of course, the portal collapses.

They are chased by mutants and rescued by humans who they find out are the descendants of scientists who survived a nuclear war. It is now 2071 and the survivors are building an ark ship to travel to Alpha Centauri and a habitable planet they hope to colonize and save the human race.

Love the practical effects used for the budget at hand. Some are magic tricks filmed in real time.

Look for sci-fandom curator and cult figure Forrest J. Ackerman in a cameo as a technician in the future.

I also love how they tackled the nuclear aftermath and the humans were benevolent and not sinister for a change and the mutants the good guys a la Dances with Wolves, Avatar etc.

It was also nice to see that there are actually 3 types of humans now and the ending was amazing. I was just thinking that it would be a time loop and it ends with a time loop.

The only question is when they reach the 100,000 years in to the future, do they encounter more copies of themselves again and again???

It starts interesting;ly in a lab that is running out of funding; lighting is flat like a TV show and you wonder if its going to improve and it does (would have looked better as B&W I think). In just ten minutes an imaginative time window opens in vast desert, hovering above the sand like the doorway back to civilization that it is. Talent here is quite good; Preston Foster of course is top shelf; Steve Franken is the surprise; usually a snotty, baby-faced upperclassman like in Dobie Gillis, he shows range and is generally the most likable of the Travelers. I always enjoy rugged Philip Carey, but they just don't give him much to do. His talents are pretty much wasted by the as-usual poor producing job by IB Melchior (Angry Red Planet). On the other hand, he produces from his own screenplay which has many inventive and clever sequences (I'm thinking the Android factory here) with enough to recommend, plus a few unexpected high end effects and surprisingly just-OK photography by top tier talent Vilmos Zigmond (who redeemed himself with The Black Stallion). This is a ""He's up! No, he's down"" kind of review, but thats the kind of film this is.

Unlike so many B movies of the era, where they would have a gimmick (IE basically a monster or alien costume), and pretty much begin filming with a half baked plot and seemingly no overall plan, this movie was well thought out.  The special effects were well done for the era, and must have been done by a magician (literally: at least three special effects - turning the circles into squares, removing the android's head, and the disappearing man - were all magic tricks with special props that were filmed real-time with no camera tricks).  They actually gave the time-travel process some serious thought, and tried to portray some of the dangers that can occur when you start messing with time.  They present an actual moral conundrum and attempt to resolve it as well.  Anyway, this movie stands quite a bit above many of the other sci-fi B movies of the era.  It's also interesting that the poster is in black and white, because this movie is in glorious color and the quality is very good.

Although it tells an apocalyptic story, it presents a hopeful and romantic view of Earth's future - inventive, humorous, even a little sexy in a wholesome way. It is worth noting that most of the special effects in the film were either created in-camera or live on the set, in the manner of stage magic; there is one effect involving the removal of an android's head that will have you rewinding and rewatching the scene over and over to see how it was done.

When they go forward in time 107 years, it looks a lot like the Forbidden Zone in the original ""Planet of the Apes."" There are several similarities between the canyons they walk in and where the Sand People attacked Luke on Tatooie in ""Star Wars: The New Hope.""

The rest of the movie has remarkable similarities to episodes of the original Star Trek, which began production in 1966: Besides looking like a giant, four button etch-a-sketch, the portal looks significantly like the time portals in ""All Our Yesterdays"" and/or ""City on the Edge of Forever."" The rapid aging is almost the same as the ""The Deadly Years."" Speeding up so that everything else looks like it isn't moving is straight out of ""Wink of an Eye."" The time travel concept draws heavily from ""Tomorrow is Yesterday"" and ""Assignment: Earth."" The parallel universe concept is straight out of ""The Alternative Factor."" The identical androids are from ""I, Mudd.""

This film was made in 1963/64, before Star Trek.

I have always been fascinated by various time travel movies/television shows - The Time Machine, Planet of The Apes, etc.  While the technology, scientific explanations, special effects are dated, it, like many such movies from the time period, served as a warning of the kind of future awaiting those who technological advances (nuclear) are inevitably used for conquest/defense.  Balancing the bright futures/utopias that had been imagined with the reality/consequences/responsibility of the atomic age.  Some interesting points regarding the conflict with the advanced/normal humans and the mutants (intellect vs animal instinct), creating a class of servant androids, interstellar travel, time loops/being outside of time, etc. (interesting ending) ... some cute bits of humor along the way (eg, android factory) ... needed more character development ... had hoped past&future could have been explored... the movie itself reminded me a bit of the Outer Limits ... leaving the viewer with something(s) to ponder.",1413676800,,1155,5.577142857142857

Most B movies were so bad we had more fun making jokes about the poor production values and rotten scripts than we enjoyed the films.  Some genius would put on a ""Please don't throw popcorn boxes at the screen advertisement""  at the start of each show. Naturally we all had our flattened popcorn boxes read to throw at the screen the minute the ad came on. Maybe this gave someone at Whammo the idea for the Frisbee This movie has the usual big chested babes inserted for prurient interest Hollywood seemed to feel necessary in B Sci Fi movies. As a film this movie is more interesting for the way it represents the values of the time in which it was produced than any great story line or special effects.

We felt too much was missing for a B movie to become reproduced into a new film production, and I expected more from Burroughs and DOBIL, even for back then in ""TIME,"" 54 years ago, when we write this. The garden of Eden was in the ending of the film, and did not connect to the beginning of Bible chronology, as we expected from the beginning of the film, which quoted Scripture so much and so well.  There were probably many sequel productions anticipated. And, it looks reminiscent of Irwin Allen's TIME TUNNEL, and some of the music was reminiscent of Rod Serling's TWILIGHT ZONE.

Plot points were introduced and then never brought up again. An inordinate amount of time was spent showing the ""android factory"" in such a way that it could have been seen as Santa's toy shop. (Chirpy music, happy workers, spanking new androids off to happily toil in heavy industry, etc).

I somehow had forgotten that those scary android eye-balls on the assembly line were being manned by beautiful young tanned females.  (Maybe at 6 years old I just didn't care.)  And that the terrifying android assembly line hand and finger parts grabbing the guy from behind now appears possibly to be merely attempting to scratch a bunghole itch.  I didn't realize that one of the time travelers was that hilariously drunk butler in Peter Seller's ""The Party.""

5020942,5,B006VJFULS,"I was really glad to see this available on Amazon Instant Video.  This is a film I remembered very fondly after having seen it only once on late night TV in the 70's.  While at the level of B-movie production values, everything is done well.  The acting is solid if little bit formulaic, while the special effects were at least the quality of the original Star Trek (one of the main characters played Dr. Boyce in the first Star Trek pilot which was made into the 2-part episode ""The Cage"").  The plot involves a group of scientists in 1964 who accidentally open a time portal 107 years into the future, and who become trapped with the remnants of humanity who are trying to escape the Earth for the stars.  There are some of the favorite science fiction tropes from the 50's and 60's, i.e. hostile mutants, and (friendly) androids.  The costumes are suitably skimpy for the women and strangely lounge lizard type plunging necklines for the men.  Some good tongue in cheek humor lightens the mood for what would otherwise be a very grim topic (post nuclear holocaust survival).  There is a temporal paradox and the last scenes in the film are an accelerating time loop which I remembered vividly from my first viewing, and is still impressive today.  Note the presence of ""superfan"" Forrest J. Ackerman (the square gasket guy...you'll know what I mean when you see it).  Ackerman was possibly the greatest science fiction fan of all time, and appeared in numerous bit parts in film.

5020954,5,B006VJFULS,"The Time Travelers (1964) with John Hoyt (the original 'Bones' - Dr. Philip Boyce in The Cage) is absolutely the most interesting SciFi film I have ever seen.  While it does not have the depth of story line or visual polish of The Forbidden Planet, or the heady moral value of It Came From Outer Space, or the wonderful story telling quality of The Day The Earth Stood Still (1951), this so called 'B' movie is at least B+ if not A in intrinsic value, and is a TOP LIST MUST for any collection.

Here are the several of the parts of this ambitious little film that I find so impressive.

Lots of time is spent developing both the story and the many characters (to include the Androids) - the plot takes some predictable turns, yet still has the ah-ha effect of going somewhere you ultimately do not expect - and throughout the film I smiled and smirked at the many comic bits and tongue-in-cheek moments, even those presented by some of the set pieces and props.

Every scene is full of elements that are direct precedents to Gene Roddenberry's Start Trek, including John Hoyt who was in the first ST Pilot, The Cage.  From the Time Portal, to the many returns used in a couple hallways to give the effect of several scenic locations, to the scant dress of the women, to the transporter mechanism, to the hyper-time existence used near the end of the movie (used in By Any Other Name - incidentally the alien ship in this ST episode is headed from the Andromeda Galaxy, the destination of the rocket is this film).  Every few minutes I could see the influence of this film on Gene's production value and story telling.  There are so many bits and pieces of Gene in this film that I especially recommend it to all my Trekker friends.  Watch this and see how many items you can find.

Ultimately, this film is funny, goofy, interesting, entertaining, scientifically robust, and one that does not take itself too serious.  It has my highest recommendation, and hopefully with interest from all of us, more and better DVD copies will become available - hear me Amazon!

I should try to justify my dislike of the movie. I did not like how the story  developed. Characters was poorly done. Mutants exist but they really don't seem to contribute to the story other than to provide a urgent need  to complete the ship on time.  It looks like one of council members might become the antagonist, but he does not oppose the time travelers, he simply  points out the facts of the situation.

8505030,3,B006VJFULS,"Ultra-cheesy '60's science fiction fare.  The music is at times spectacularly inappropriate, the dialog grating (Holy McKee!) and miniatures of the star ship fairly shout ""Lego"", but you know what?  It's an entertaining watch and a fascinating window into a bizarre bit of American culture.  Fix some popcorn.",1506556800,,309,5.395833333333333
8505031,4,B006VJFULS,"Four scientists in a control room of sorts, doing a time experiment, accidentally take a trip forward in time, while following a technician (Steve Franken) into a portal.  Before anyone can point out just how reckless this is, one by one they follow the leader and find themselves trapped in a dismal future.  Chased by mutants, they are barely saved by whats left of humanity, on the verge of leaving Earth for a better planet.  Things do not go according to plan though, when they are told they cant come with them.  In haste, they try to reconstruct their fluke time portal to escape back into the past where they belong.

Originally called the Time Trap, this movie plays out like something made especially for TV.  At times it feels a bit juvenile in its approach, complete with cartoon music and jokes provided by the technician.
However fascinating the premise, it could have been dealt with in serious fashion.  This was a missed opportunity.",1497571200,,950,4.7560975609756095
8505032,5,B006VJFULS,"Watched with not much hope in watching the whole movie, but this movie has a great story line and it's way better than I expected, totally watchable and can keep you interested in the characters, like, love, or hate them. A classic Saturday Matinee or a late-night Drive-in.
This is a 5 Star B-movie.",1487808000,,300,4.574074074074074
