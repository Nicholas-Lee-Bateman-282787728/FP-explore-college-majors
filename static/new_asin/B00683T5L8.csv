4972629,4,B00683T5L8,"Perhaps the best way to summarize the feeling you'll receive from Jack the Giant Slayer is this: Welcome back, Bryan Singer; You are indeed forgiven for Superman Returns, sir.

No, really, it is THAT good.

It is good enough to make you forget that horrid moment when Superman was getting dragged hair- and face-first by some nameless goons (oh and Kumar), and he managed to let out a desperate, horrifically out-of-character scream of, I'm still Superman!

For those of you who know what I'm talking about, you know what I'm talking about. For those of you who are going to zip on over to YouTube or dig through your guilty pleasure collection and fast-forward that fumbled rehash of the Richard Donner and Christopher Reeves era with the subtitles on: You.

Were.

WARNED 



  Did you see it?

Awful, right? And now you can't UN-see it. You're welcome.

BUT! Even though you can't erase the memory I've just Incepted you with, you can certainly run down to your local theater now and use the epically fun Jack the Giant Slayer to cleanse your mental palette.

Now, I'm not sure how many people have been following the development of this film. After all, Singer certainly didn't exactly help his Hollywood credibility following up Superman Returns by throwing a Nazi uniform on Tom Cruise (though, for the record, Valkyrie was good!). Perhaps the uh Stanley Tucci fans? Ewan McGregor fans? Did they forget the Jedi-mullet?  In any case, based on the weekend receipts and projections, it's not going to be pretty, and the studio did jack squat (see what I did there) to help this picture by showcasing the films worst instances of CGI in the trailers and utilizing that beat-to-death marketing campaign of flooding a trailer with utterances of the titular character's name (looking at YOU, Parker!).

The poor box office is simply a travesty. Let's not forget Singer gave us one of the greatest superhero movies of all time in X-Men 2 AND he wrote the story for the much-beloved X-Men: First Class (which people seem to forget when they claim every X-film before First Class was trash, but I digress). Not to mention the powerful Apt Pupil and everyone's favorite pimpin' limpin' villain in The Usual Suspect's Keyser Soze.

After that, we OWE it to Singer, dammit, because this film is so good. And you know what MAKES this movie so good? Singer had the balls to break the conventions we would've pointed to to justify the feeble box office, and both the storytelling and action were so tight that you can almost picture Singer going, Yeah, remember me? Remember what I can do? Well, I pictured it, and I certainly was forced to remember what he's capable of.

The film, like any other, has flaws, ranging from the miscasting of King Brahmwell (Ian McShane (should have been Bernard Hill)), a Padme-and-Anakin-esque conversation between Jack (Nicholas Hoult) and Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) early on, and distracting aesthetics like Jack's hoodie and Elmont (McGregor)'s Team Edward haircut. Not to mention some video-game-level CGI that goes into the giants, which we all should've been aware of going into the theater.

However, the key to any good story is not to be free of flaws but to be alive and organic enough to essentially force the audience to get over them because the ride is just that gripping. Such was the case with Jack the Giant Slayer. It would have been so easy for Singer to regurgitate all the trappings of fantasy and adventure storytelling into a quick cash-machine without putting any thought and energy into the subtle complexities (looking at YOU this time, Wreck-It-Ralph). Instead, there is care put into virtually every aspect of this film. Upon every instance of you as the audience starting to believe you've got a bead on what's going to happen next, this movie utterly smashes your expectations and puts together something even better.

You want specifics, you say? Well, first of all, this movie is full of characters who actually THINK. It's a sad state of our modern movie-going experience when we can watch a movie free of characters who are stupid because the plot demands they should be stupid. Sure, Jack must make that initial exchange for the Magic Beans as the classic fairytale dictates, but his curiosity was piqued early on by his father telling him stories of an ancient war with a race of giants that reside in a cloud kingdom, and Jack wasn't the only one. Isabelle receives a joint bedtime story exposition sequence and acquires a taste for adventure from her royal mother (which is perhaps all-too-familiar for the five of us who saw Hellboy II: The Golden Army). Following the death of both of these orating parents (which should've been given a scene), Jack is left in the hands of a cruel uncle and Isabelle her protective father.

A chance encounter with Isabelle in town plants the seeds of romance for these two, and Jack gets a taste of her world, which entails constant supervision by the elite King's Guardians, headed by McGregor's Elmont and his trusty second-in-command Crawe (Eddie Marsan), who also required an additional scene to round them out. After Jack and Isabelle inevitably receive their scoldings from their guardians for being too naive, the former is left steaming and in possession of the beans, while the latter flees from both the castle and her arranged marriage to the boundlessly ambitious and ruthless Roderick (Stanley Tucci). Isabelle happens upon Jack's cottage while his uncle is out attempting to rectify Jack's misguided transaction, and following that at-times painful exchange I mentioned before, one of the beans gets wet, sprouts, and we're off to the races!

What follows is wonderful example of what can get done in fantasy/action-adventure films when the writer and director have zero tolerance for a stale and meandering plot. Once Jack is discovered at the bottom of the beanstalk, absent princess-in-distress, a rescue party is dispatched, and both Jack and Roderick inevitably join up in the race to retrieve Isabelle before the giants realize they've got a route to wage war on humanity once again. At this point you may start to mentally prepare yourself for yet another drawn-out journey where the company is able to rescue Isabelle and in the process exhibit all that is right with Jack and all that is wrong with Roderick; add a dash of blatant set-piece action, a sniveling coward character for comic relief, and a moment when the leading woman takes her place amongst the boys by being the one to stop the war and save everyone's collective ass, and we're set, right?

Wrong.

Not only does this story have brains, it has guts.

Secondary characters are forced to don red shirts and walk the tight-rope.

Roderick's personal goon (Ewen Bremner) is much scarier than he has any right to be.

Isabelle sees Jack for who he is on his own merits and not in stark contrast to Roderick, whose motives aren't allowed to simmer for 90 minutes before a grand betrayal.

And the giants do make it down to the ground to go Gojira on our structures and devour humans in brutal (albeit in blood- and gore-free) fashion.

The heroes are roughly thrust into an impossible situation and forced to handle it, and it feels so good to find a storyteller who does not fall so in love with his own creations that they are unwilling to take this sink-or-swim approach. To those of you who cringed at the CGI displayed in the trailers, allow me to assuage your apprehensions by saying Singer smartly films in a manner to keep the giants and humans separate for the majority of the movie, and everything that should have been a physical prop, WAS a physical prop. There's even a scene where one of hour heroes is about to be turned into a pastry and you can watch the giant crepe bread they've been wrapped in BAKE. And the scale and pace of the action was just unapologetically both brutal and fun. The King gets hands-on and makes sacrifices to drive home the severity of the threat. Furthermore, the tactics and innovations in the climactic battle make it clear that the giants and humans have been preparing for the possibility of another war for a very long time, and the battle is sprinkled with glorious tide-swinging moments up until the final charge.

AND, when the short-lived World War Giant II is over, we're given the cherry on top in the form of a foreboding wink that Singer has perfected.

I freely admit that perhaps the reason why I enjoyed this movie so much was because I let it catch me off-guard. I went in with tempered expectations. And no doubt some of you will now watch the film after I've hyped it up and be disappointed. But don't come back and say it sucked. And don't even say that the film's quality exists in a vacuum unsullied by the audience's interpretation. Instead, simply join me in saying: Welcome back, Bryan Singer; You are indeed forgiven for Superman Returns, sir.",1362355200,3,8906,4.812704649639817
4972630,3,B00683T5L8,"Director Bryan Singer's long awaited fantasy adventure, ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is finally here, and it's better than I expected, but not that great either. I heard about ""Jack the Giant Killer"" early last year (2012), then nothing more. Now I know what happened. It was scheduled for release, June 15, 2012, but was delayed until now because of production problems. Many adjustments were made to the original films screenplay including title change. This film is very entertaining BUT, I'm disappointed in it because it lacks the magic, emotion, and scary (giant awe), I was hoping for in a well crafted and told giant story. Instead, I got to watch a poorly rendered CGI giant eat his boogers, another one fart, and the two-headed one belch and argue with himself continually. This could have been so much better. It reminded me of the CGI work done in the 1995 fantasy film, ""Jumanji"". Also; These giants are not respectable or scary giants in any way. They are all ugly, behave immature and are bumbling and stupid. They end up being flat with no presence, unengaging and mostly boring. I wanted to be thrilled by these giants. I was not.

This films story started off promising enough. It begins with the re-telling of the ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" story told separately, to two small children (Jack and Princess Isabelle), then jumps forward ten years and their grow-up. The hero Jack (played by English actor Nicholas Hoult, recently seen in 2012 ""Warm Bodies""), saves the heroine, Princess Isabelle (played by English actress Eleanor Tomlinson, who you may remember as the young Sophie in 2006 ""The Illusionist""), from drunk bar ruffians, while she's out (incognito), mingling with her subjects at a bar. Isabelle is then safely whisked off (away from Jack), on horseback to her palace by her handsome and able Captain of the Guard, Elmont (preformed by talented Scottish actor Ewan McGregor, known for his recent staring role in Oscar nominated 2012 ""The Impossible""). McGregor's character, Elmont seems to have more of a hero role in this story then Hoult's character Jack does. McGregor's acting is solid giving this film a serious feel. Isabelle's father, the king is played by English actor Ian McShane, who was made to wear armor in this film that is by far the worst looking armor I have ever seen in a movie, in my life. All the costumes in this film are hideous. So much so that it was distracting, throwing me out of the movie and back into the audience many times throughout this film. The enjoyable villain, Lord Roderick is preformed excellently by Stanley Tucci. He's great and did a wonderful job preforming his character.

The action is great throughout this film. This is where this film really shines and the entertaining factor comes in. There is an exciting giants-against-the-humans war near the end that had me on the edge of my seat. I LOVED the beanstalk! All the scenes with the beanstalk in it are great!

""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is ultimately a fail for me mostly because I was confused by the screenplays inability to make up it's mind if it was a gross kids movie or a serious, well made adult adventure fantasy/action romance. Even with all of this films problems, I still enjoyed parts of it, and the ending is perfect...but I can't recommend it. Something went horribly wrong with this film during it's production, and it shows. The two-headed giant may be the cause. Too many cooks in the kitchen make a mess! In this films case...too many writers. It's too bad. It could have been great. If you do decide to see this entertaining mess...Enjoy!

4972631,2,B00683T5L8,"Jack the Giant Slayer, directed by Bryan Singer (X-Men, Valkyrie), is the tale of Jack (Nicholas Hoult), a struggling farm boy that happens to meet Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), the adventurous princess of Cloister.  After a priest gives Jack a sack of mystical beans (which shouldn't be touched by water), Jack and Isabelle are suddenly separated during a rain storm when one of the beans grows into the heavens, or in this case, the home of the giants - taking Isabelle with it.  King Brahmwell (Ian McShane) sends a group of his men, including Jack, Elmont (Ewan McGregor) - the leader of the king's army, and Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci) - the king's trusted/devious advisor, to retrieve his daughter.  Naturally, matters are complicated when the humans are captured by the giants.  Eddie Marsan and Ewen Bremner also star in supporting roles, while Bill Nighy and John Kassir lend their voices for Fallon, the double-headed leader of the giants.

Sadly, this film had a great deal of potential, yet the script suffered mightily from lack of character development, as well as plot depth - which can both be detrimental to the quality of the overall film.  However, Nicholas Hoult (one of the young, up-and-coming actors) saves the day with his fearless prowess and giant slaying ability.  Even though Hoult does have some bland scenes, he isn't to blame for his poorly written character.  Obviously, a film like this is not going to be overly heavy on the dialogue anyway, but still - it would have been nice to see at least one show-stealing scene between ANY of this cast's fine actors.  But, sadly (once again), it never comes.  Ewan McGregor and Ian McShane, two masterful and powerful actors, both have their talents utterly wasted in this film.  Their characters are bland, mediocrely written, and just downright forgettable.

Overall, the script stays true enough to the original stories, Jack and the Beanstalk and Jack the Giant Killer - enough so to make for an interesting viewing experience.  While the expectations for fairy tale live action films are low (even though the budgets are typically high), director Bryan Singer makes the best out of this film, and for that he should be commended.  Combine Singer's direction with the visibly pleasing CGI, not to mention a plot that gives the bare minimum amount of information, and we arrive at a perfectly average fairy tale/fantasy film.  It's certainly not as interesting as The Lord of the Rings, but it's also not as frighteningly horrible as 2011's Red Riding Hood.  Therefore, Jack and his beanstalk can take some solace right between the lands of 'greatness' and 'terrible.'

4972737,5,B00683T5L8,This is a classic folklore tale that leaves you wondering.... could it be possible? After all perhaps truth and fiction are one. Old historians certainly thought so. Acting performances are very well done across the board and there is a very special and sweet chemistry between Eleanor Tomlinson (princess Isabelle) and Nicholas Hoult (Jack). The story is tangible and takes one back to being a child when the outstanding doesn't seem silly. Magical and action packed- never a dull moment from start to finish- the special affects are fantastic. A must watch and own.,1476316800,,567,5.042553191489362

4972745,5,B00683T5L8,"This movie is fun from start to finish.  The acting is superb as are the writing, scenery and special effects.  It's great story-telling at its best.  One caveat.  Really young children may be disturbed when they see the giants pick up humans and eat them.  So use you own good judgment about letting the little ones watch it.",1474588800,,326,4.551724137931035

4972835,3,B00683T5L8,"This movie seems to borrow visually from the classic children's  book  ""Are All The Giants Dead?""  written by Mary Norton in 1975. I highly recommend this book if you enjoyed the movie. The climbing scenes with the 2 children as they go to the Giants kingdom are just as I imagined them when reading the book, the story differs somewhat, both I found very enjoyable.",1453161600,,366,4.6
4972836,4,B00683T5L8,"We all know the story...or at least we think we know it.  Jack The Giant
Slayer is loosely based on the fairy tale that all of us grew up with.  I say
loosely, as the film suggests that this is the original story from which other
variations grew from. Oh, don't worry, all the basic elements are still firmly
in place here.  We have the young, adolescent farm boy Jack (Nicholas Hoult),
who goes to town to sell his horse. Instead of bringing home money to pay for
needed repairs on his uncle's roof, he returns with a pouch filled with magic
beans. One of the beans gets wet, and from it, a monstrous beanstalk sends
him into into the clouds to a land where Giants roam. Jack The Giant Slayer
introduces some original twists to the story by adding several new characters.
There's a beautiful Princess (Eleanor Tomlinson) who gets kidnapped by the
giants, a King (Ian McShane) longing for the return of his daughter, and his
most trusted knight (Ewan McGregor) sent to the top of the beanstalk to rescue
her.  Of course, every story like this must have a villain (if the Giants weren't
exactly enough), and Stanley Tucci seems to fit that role rather perfectly playing
Roderick, the King's advisor.

I suppose from the start, I should have put a little more faith into Director Bryan
Singer (X-MEN, The Usual Suspects) who knows a little something about how to
effectively tell a story.  By the time our hero reaches atop the beanstalk, the film
suddenly shifts into something incredibly epic.  Filled with immense set pieces and
outstanding visual effects, Jack The Giant Slayer begins to look and feel like
something out of Peter Jackson's The Hobbit.  I couldn't believe how much I found
myself enjoying what was suddenly evolving before me.

How does the 3D fare?  Well, things don't start off very promising.  In fact, while
I was watching the story unfold, I questioned whether the studio's decision to film
Jack The Giant Slayer in native 3D was simply a money-making scheme.  Most of
what I was viewing looked mostly flat and uninspiring.  A few camera angles from
below and above briefly provided some sense of depth, and the abundant usage
of rain provided some interesting outward effects as particles of water sprayed
forward. Once again, it pays to be patient.  Once Jack arrives to the land of Giants,
everything suddenly begins to make sense as the process greatly enhances the
breathtaking production design and marvelous, often dazzling special effect work.
Most of all, the 3D effectively conveys proper size, scale and proportion of the men
against the monstrous unfamiliar world around them.  For those like myself who
enjoy the ""In Yo' Face"" gimmickry, there isn't much to be had here sans a few
surprising moments.  For instance, a buzzing bee quickly flies out of screen as it
harasses a giant that resembles boxing promoter Don King.  In another scene, a
giant breaks through the castle floor sending small pieces of foundation hurdling
towards the viewer.

The Blu-ray presentation is immaculate and effectively delivers the film's rich color
scheme, perfectly saturated throughout.  Filmed with the latest motion-capture
technology, the 25 foot tall CGI characters come across more digital than life-like,
but nonetheless, their grisly qualities are effectively conveyed in a transfer that is
always sharp and well detailed.

You need not wait to feel the impact of the film's robust 5.1 DTS-MA soundtrack.
From the opening moments, filled with claps of thunder, you can sense the presence
of low-end bass.  However, consider it a mere tease for things to come.  Be prepared
for 22 minutes later, when a sprouting beanstalk gives your system one of the
hardest workouts it ever has endured.  If you dare, turn it up loud.  Yes, folks, this
is a hard-hitting soundtrack where every giant step is reinforced with LFE reverb.
Surrounds provide excellent panning and placement for the film's multitude of effect
work as well as threatening dialogue from giants that travel from one channel to
another.  I am certain you will agree that this is an amazing audio experience.

Jack The Giant Slayer arrives as a combo pack that contains a 3D Blu-ray, 2D
Blu-ray and a single DVD which contains UltraViolet content for download.
I particularly like the outer lenticular cardboard sleeve artwork that contains
a giant hand reaching towards Jack.  Extra features on the Blu-ray include a
""Become a Giant Slayer"" Interactive Experience; Deleted scenes and a gag reel.
The DVD contains the same features minus the Interactive Experience.

Theatrically released in the winter during a time when most studios try and
push their least-likable fare --- and going up against Disney's Oz The Great
and Powerful --- it seems as if Jack The Giant Slayer could have benefited
from better release placement.  It is my guess and hope that this film receives
a rousing second chance on home screens.  For adults, it's a highly energized
adventure/action film that is miles ahead of Oz in entertainment value (though
the 3D is inferior).  Be aware that it's overall intensity may not make it suited
for children.

Is it worth spending $10 more for the 3D combo pack over the 2D counterpart?
I can only say, ""perhaps.""  This is not close to the best 3D presentation I have
ever viewed, but the process does lend to heightening the film's incredible visuals.

Don't underestimate this title as I did.  Definitely worthy of a watch.",1453075200,,5430,4.910186199342826

Many visual effects are not seen in the 2D version making the 3D more enjoyable. Color is bright with broad coverage of the croma range.

The fairy-tale adventure of a gullible farm boy thrust literally and horticulturally into circumstances where he must prove his worth or perish.

What did I think?

Bryan Singer takes the quirky elements of a childrens fable and grittily reboots it. No longer restricted to water-color illustrations, the giants and the bean stalk become monstrous entities. The action and violence are larger than life and occasionally pushes against the PG rating potentially upsetting some parents and a few children. (They love it.)

Surprisingly satisfying for anyone who has ever enjoyed the age old tale and/or delighted in Ewan McGregor at his hammiest.",1423958400,2,661,5.326923076923077

He gives it a 4 because it was ""quite scary"". I tried to reason with him that because the movie was scary, perhaps it should be given a 5, but no, he feels the scariness should put the movie at a 4. So a 4 it is!

I personally didn't feel the movie was overly scary for an 8 year old. There were some parts where I could see him flinching, but he knew it was a fairy tale and that it would end well, so that eased the pressure a bit.

The movie was very well done, realistic giant figures, perfect scary-ness level, a bit of romance, lots of action! A great movie for a family movie night!",1420502400,,742,3.875

The storyline is good because it's both recognizable yet different.  The acting is good because the producers paid for good actors.  The animation, such as it was (CGI), was really good.

The moved did come as described.  I was a little nervous because the picture only shows blu ray but the description did say it was the combo (blu ray, dvd and uv).  It was the combo and the price was fantastic.  It came in good condition and played on all my players and the sound was good as well.  No complaints!",1405123200,,470,4.043478260869565

The giants coud be quite scary, they eat people and there is quite a lot of violence & death.  Great family film with your older children, and great for people who don't have kids.  No sex or cussing that I picked up on (except the king said hell no).  The giants have crude behaviors, but my sons loved it.

Although this is rated PG-13 for ""Intense scenes of fantasy action violence, some frightening images and brief language,"" kids will clearly know this is fantasy as opposed to their everyday exposure to violence in the news, on TV and in the theaters.

There is absolutely nothing offensive in this film for any age group. It is good all-around fun and entertainment.",1402444800,,573,4.39622641509434

Trying to sell their horse for money Jack gets pulled into an adventure which involves fighting giants and becoming a hero.  I like the characters and feel the acting is good.  There are a few fight scenes and a battle scene as well.  It is not perfect, but it is a fun way to spend an evening and left me wanting to watch it again.",1401062400,,502,4.134020618556701

Jack the Giant Slayer did a wonderful job in keeping you interested, even though you already know the story.

Given the advancements in CGI technology and the budget this film had I'm at a complete loss how the giants could look so unconvincing.

This movie was an excellent tool to pair with Jack and the Beanstalk and The Sister's Grimm: Fairytale  Detectives. Students compared and contrasted among other concepts in order to justify watching a movie in class. They thoroughly enjoyed. Even though it is rated PG-13 I only heard two mild swear words (hell and bastard, I believe). There is plenty of violence but the killing is alluded to and not shown on screen. Students loved the special effects. Will use this one again next year.",1399680000,,583,4.888888888888889

I'm usually very cautious about what my kids watch and nothing in this seemed as bad as some of the reviews made it out to be.

Jack is the reluctant hero but shines so well. Young boys will especially like this version of Jack. The other characters are depicted excellently, and at times, light heartedly, slightly over the top in a way that is tongue in cheek without being snide. Kids will enjoy this too. They will smile.

Art and CGI are great both regarding the giants, their cloud kingdom, and the beanstalk. And art direction in general is very good. A little over the top, but I think that's part of why I smile so much when I watch this movie. Good stuff.",1396569600,,645,4.6

4973114,3,B00683T5L8,"Jack the Giant Slayer is a good and fun movie to watch with your family.  Other than that, it was okay.  Jack and the Princess were... boooooring (and unconvincing in their roles).  The CG in the movie was absolutely fantastic, and it brought the old story from every child's storybook to life perfectly.  I even like the two-headed General.  Watching Jack the Giant Slayer is like playing Monopoly with the kiddies; at first it's fun, but then you're thinking... why is this thing still on?  Ewan McGregor, as always, is enjoyable in this movie.  With the exception of Ewan, I don't think any of the actors stood out.  The ending was incredibly anti-climactic.  However, the movie does what it intends to do... give you a reason to read Jack and the Beanstalk to the kiddies.",1395705600,,776,4.688888888888889

4973130,5,B00683T5L8,"Its about time someone admitted it. The Bible speaks of Giants that we looked like grasshoppers to. David hunted down Goliath's brothers one by one. They ate people, and hunted people in the streets like dogs! Finally a movie that leaves open the possibility that  the stories and records that have been handed down through time actually lived in a very different world, and weren't just off their rocker! They did an excellent job with the movie. Before seeing it I already had in mind to write my own ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" story called ""The Beans"" Mine will be better. :) There's was still excellent, and I loved the ending! Opportunity for a sequal indeed. Also the young actor who also played in ""Warm Bodies"" has a great career ahead of him!!!",1393545600,,751,4.646616541353383
4973131,5,B00683T5L8,My boyfriend and I really enjoyed this movie. I bought it for my 7 year old granddaughter. She loved it too. It might be a little too scary for kids younger since the Giants are very real looking. Great adventure!,1393459200,,213,4.35

Might be too violent for young kids but, probably, ok for 12 year olds or so.  OK, the 6 year olds would like it but might have bad dreams.

4973149,4,B00683T5L8,Overall a very good effort.  The characters and story line are believable but predictable.  The main reason we got the DVD/Blu-ray was my wife likes to watch the extra features,1391644800,,176,4.833333333333333
4973150,5,B00683T5L8,"I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I'm not 12-year-old! I didn't even have the grandkids with me, but I was compelled to watch the movie because I loved this story as a kid and I think Ewan McGregor and Nicholas Hoult are excellent actors as well as quite handsome. What I was afforded was way more than entertainment and eye-candy. I was proud to see that Princess Isabel was afforded a strong female role rather than cast as a simple damsel-in-distress. The romance between her and Jacks builds well and is very believable. Also believable are the giants, oh my! This movie is sure to be a crowd-pleaser. Do watch!",1391644800,,618,4.627272727272727

YOU'LL FIND YOURSELF THROWING THIS ONE ON AGAIN EVERY FEW MONTHS.

4973160,4,B00683T5L8,"I wish more directors would shoot in 3d. It adds depth and such , however this is a converted film into 3d. And it has that look about it. Unlike a film shot in 3d that is.  There is a huge difference in 3d depth , that comes with actually shooting a film in 3d. This is ok in 3d though , the 3d disc is slightly darker than the 2d version though.  As a film it is a good family film for kids older than 7 , as the gaints eat people. But at a distance , with no blood though.  SO it's far less gory than a video game. It is a good flick for the whole family and the 3d does add some depth. NOt like a film shot in the format though.  In fact every movie could benefit from being shot in 3d. wether you plan a shot that takes advantage of the 3d doesn't matter. Some films are all about that ,  'silent hill 3d' is about the money shots. this one isn't. but it's still good and would have looked better if shot in 3d.  3d is a varied tool and I could watch any movie in it.  it adds depth. or to see a flick with some shots that utilize that 3d.  But this is mainly just a kids flick the 3d adds to it some.  It would have added more if they shot it that way.  The picture looks fine and I saw no ghosting on this one.",1390867200,,1217,3.71875

4973183,4,B00683T5L8,"When I heard that Bryan Singer was remaking the film ""Jack the Giant Killer"", I was a bit surprised.  The original 1962 film was basically a second feature that reunited many of the individuals involved in making the 1958 classic ""Seventh Voyage of Sinbad.""  There was the star Kerwin Matthews, the villain Torin Thatcher and the Director, Nathan Juran.  As a matter of fact the only one missing was the genius and special effects legend Ray Harryhausen, who was deemed too expensive to use on this film.  The basic plot was farm boy Jack rescuing a Princess kidnapped by an evil giant being used by main villain Thatcher.  As stated, it was an enjoyable little second feature for 12 year olds (at the time) like me.  I even still have the Dell Comics adaptation.  I couldn't figure why Singer would want to remake this film.
Well after seeing it in the movies, it became obvious.  The film, now renamed"" Jack the Giant Slayer,"" was a combination of the original story and the Jack and the Beanstalk legend.  The special effects are truly excellent.  The film is exciting when Jack and several of the kings soldiers, led by the suave Ewan MacGregor, climb the beanstalk to encounter the giants in their own domain.  The excitement really kicks into high gear when the giants come down to earth and attack the mid-evil kingdom of King Ian McShane.  These scenes are truly incredible to behold and must have looked great on an IMAX screen.
Well anyway, concerning the sad fate of this film, it was supposed to be a summer release but was kicked back by Warner Bros. until the following March (supposedly to complete the special effects.)  It opened to mediocre business its first week and was absolutely crushed by Disney's ""Oz"" the second week.  (I saw both films in the movies and preferred this one although"" Oz"" was enjoyable as well.)  This film wound up losing millions and continued Bryan Singer's losing streak since leaving the X Men films to make the disappointing ""Superman Returns.""  (He is now back at work directing the new X Men film scheduled for release next summer.)
The picture and sound on blu-ray are fine.  There are little extras including some deleted scenes (including an excellent scene of Jack running across a giant drawbridge.)  There is also a short gag reel.
In conclusion, this is a beautiful looking film with astounding special effects and a truly exciting and rousing conclusion.  It deserved to do much better than it did.  Check it out,  If you enjoy this type of film, I have little doubt that you will enjoy it.",1388880000,,2548,4.719457013574661

Though the characters and plot are predictable (then again, this is just a fairy tale), the performers are likable and the action scenes very well done.  Blatant CGI fills almost every scene, but given the fantastical nature of the whole story, the cartoony look is appropriate.  Compare this movie to tedious junk like the Percy Jackson adaptations and the recent Hobbit flicks, and there's no doubt which one will be played back repeatedly.",1388793600,,577,4.927835051546392

The giants are overly filthy and do some gross things. Your kids may be excited or terrified. Might be a good idea to watch it first and then decide if its appropriate for your children. One question: Where are the female giants?",1388707200,,541,4.41

4973206,4,B00683T5L8,"This film is graded PG probably, although it is essentially a children's story with a story line much unlike the famed fable, there are some actions that are inappropriate for kids, such as really ugly giants, a giant with a deformed extra head, and watching giants eat humans and step on them. There are some magical elements that kids will like, such as a crown, which when worn causes the giants to obey the wearer. The story is in essence about a humble not too bright farm boy who is given some magic beans, although not as in the fable. The beans grow into a stalk that reaches toward heaven where vicious giants live. These giants had been defeated in ancient times and secluded above the clouds. A princess is captured by the giants and Jack, who had seen her previously and become enchanted by her, climbs the stalk to rescue her.",1387324800,,839,4.526315789473684

4973210,4,B00683T5L8,"Jack the Giant Slayer(released Feb/13)stars,among others,Nicholas Hoult,Eleanor Tomlinson,Ewan McGregor,Stanley Tucci,Ian McShane,Bill Nighy and John Kassir. This film is populated by a a very nice cast that consistently gels together in putting over a nice new slant on an old fairy tale;Jack and the Beanstalk.
The story begins as we see a young boy and a young girl(in two separate homes)being read the same story of giants living above the earth. The boy is Jack,poor,and the girl is a princess to be. Time passes and Jack is now living with his uncle,who sends him to the market to sell their horse and cart. While there he happens to enter a tent to watch a show based on the giants fable. A young lady is also there in disguise;the princess. When she is accosted by some thugs Jack steps in to help,but the arrival of the princess's guards puts an abrupt end to his""heroics"".Back at the castle,dad the king is upset at her constant clandestine comings and goings and her refusal to marry one of his close aids. When he puts his foot down she leaves upset. Jack meanwhile has sold his horse to a monk who happens to be on the run from some of the kings men. For payment Jack accepted some beans the monk said were priceless. When Jack arrives home his uncle tears a strip out of Jack and leaves to sell some of Jack's possessions.
That night the princess decides to leave the castle again,and she gets caught in a storm. Seeking refuge she comes upon,of all places,Jack's house. As the two get reacquainted,a bean that had fallen down between the cracks in the house floor,gets wet from the rain outside and starts to grow exponentially. Jacks ends back on terra firma,but the princess and the house get carried into the clouds by the beanstalk. When the king gets wind of what has happened he dispatches some of his best men to bring his daughter back. But treachery is afoot as the kings aide that is due to marry his daughter has plans to rule both the giants and the earth. He carries with him an ancient relic forged from the heart of a giant leader. Any wearer will rule the kingdom of the giants. When they reach the top they find the house but no princess.
The group are quickly confronted by the giants. They do find the princess eventually,but they can no longer help or free her as they quickly become captives themselves. The kings close aide finally takes his opportunity and claims his dominion over the giants. It does not last too long as he ends up battling and losing to another of the kings men. In fact the giants reclaim the crown and before the remaining members of the kings rescue party can return back to earth,the giants are already in attack mode. However the king and his men on the ground have decided to chop the beanstalk down,stopping the giants in their tracks. It does have the effect however, of making it a rather harrowing trip back down for Jack,the princess and the kings top guard.
The giants recovered not only the crown but a sack containing some of the beans and they use them to grow beanstalks downwards. They arrive on earth and attack the king and his men on their way back to the castle. They barely make it back to safety as the giants are now on the offensive. The kings forces put up a good fight but the giants are able to eventually enter the castle walls. Their leader has both Jack and the princess at his mercy,when Jack uses his final bean,by throwing it down the giants gullet. This disposes of the giant as a beanstalk grows out of him. Jack also reclaims the crown and sends the giants back to their world in the clouds.
The film comes to an end as Jack and the princess,now married,are telling their children the old story of the beanstalk and the giants. We also see that the crown was eventually forged over time into what is now the crown worn by the Queen of England for official ceremonies and is locked in the Tower of London.
This film is a pure delight from start to finish. Yes the giants are all CGI,but unlike the creatures created for R.I.P.D.(see my review on that)these look quite wonderful. In fact I would say the CGI here is on a par with anything in the Lord of the Rings trilogy of films. Considering the world that is created you can be sure the actors were shooting alot in front of blue screens, having to react to things that actually were not there. When you view the finished product,it is impressive. The story itself has got such a good twist on an old story that it keeps you interested all the way through.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 1:77:1. Extras include deleted scenes and a gag reel.
All in all a very impressive twist on an old fairy tale of giants and a beanstalk. The cast is good,the script is good and the CGI is spot on. Well recommended.",1386979200,,4768,4.4816091954022985

Maybe I like the story because I'm a farmer at heart. I love to grow things from seeds (men-we are the seeders). The story of Jack and the Bean Stalk is a powerful story. I like the bean stalk story more than the giant slayer angle. Put the emphasis on growing a bean stalk (growing a family) instead of ""slaying"". Subtle innuendoes make such a profound difference on young minds. If Jack had to kill a giant (for the protection of his family/people), hopefully he would still remorse and not pride for the act.",1386460800,,674,4.4

With a starting point of a childhood story, a princess, CGI, and giants, you'd think it was a child's movie. All the fighting and violence says it's not. Now, Grimm and Anderson had their share of violence in their fairy tales. I think that's actually better than Barnie and pretending that the world is a safe place, but this was not the type of thing you want a child watching. It's not just ""the wolf blew the house down."" It's bone crunching and catapulting  flaming trees.

4973245,4,B00683T5L8,"This movie could have easily been botched, but the producers, writers, and director pulled it off, making for a very entertaining, modernized telling of one of the most classic fairy tales. The person who deserves the most credit is whomever did the casting, because every character in this movie is full to the brim with wonderful personality and charisma - and that goes a long way. I really wanted the characters to succeed because I liked them so much. The subject matter is still a bit terrifying (as was the original fairy tale), so I believe many younger children may be horrified by the sight of these ghoulish giants feasting upon the bones of men, so use your judgment when deciding if your kids can handle this (it's rated PG-13 for a reason, and I personally feel 13 is the perfect age for this movie, maybe 12 or 11 for more mature children).

What's really cool is that the story, while vastly elaborated upon (resulting in the two hour run time of the movie), remains true to original, as far as the core elements go. The writers did a nice job of taking the sparse elements of the fairy tale and tastefully enhancing it into a feature length film. The pacing is excellent, making for an entertaining, fun filled ride with plenty of humor and suspense. I also very much appreciated the care with which the fantasy world was created, especially the airborne realm of the giants. As far as the actual behemoths themselves, their CGI rendering is very well done, and their animations and facial expressions are very convincing.

The Blu-ray transfer is pretty much perfect, as far as I can tell, with vibrant colors, immaculate detail, and fantastic sound.",1383955200,,1668,4.7285223367697595

I don't blame any of the actor's performances here but movie falls flat mostly due to tired tropes and bland writing.  I'm sure visually in theaters the effects may have seemed magical but at home even on a reasonably large screen I was left feeling ""Meh"" overall.  I don't regret renting it once, but I don't plan on watching it again.  If I could use something other than Stars to rate this I would call it ""An Airplane Movie.""",1383091200,,523,4.371134020618556

The story is entertaining, but the lead actor who played Jack seemed very detached and out-of-place in this role; he radiates a ""what am I doing here"" and I could not identify with him; see if you feel the same way. The film might be a little too scary for young children.  Once again, the 3D alone is worth purchasing this film and the story-line is good.",1382140800,2,537,4.104761904761904

4973288,3,B00683T5L8,"Well this is no Lord of the Rings but it was pretty good fun. Aside from the magic beans there is not much that is similar to the fairy-tale, which is good in that the film is reasonably original in how it develops the story. Jack is a farm boy (though you wouldn't know it from his hands!) who finds himself on a rescue mission to save the princess and then the world. The lead actor looks a bit too much like Ashton Kutcher but the giants are quite interesting and Ewan McGregor is allowed to have a lot of fun. I thought the special effects were good and the battle scenes entertaining. Much of the dialogue is a bit twee and there's predictable co-incidences but happily a few reasonable twists too. There's a gruesome moment or two as well, so it's not for small kids but most action genre fans will probably have a pleasant time over it. 3 1/2 stars",1381708800,,855,4.283950617283951

The 3D was just okay; there was ample opportunities for things in the movie to fly out into the audience but that just didn't happen.

I used to be a fan of urban, psychological Scorsese-esque thrillers but sometimes: enough is enough and you want to encounter fantastical green and growing elements with a creative plot that does not take itself too seriously yet is mature enough to hang together.

I recommend it if you are feeling nostalgic for films like Willow or Dark Crystal with a bit of the epic-ness of Lord of the Rings.",1380499200,,571,4.490384615384615

4973314,2,B00683T5L8,"Jack The Giant Slayer has set a record that no one should be proud of. This film made the least amount of money, compared to the amount of money spent on it, in box office history! The film gives new meaning to the word bomb, as it cost the studio approximately 80 million dollars! The goal of this film was ambitious, but the problem was that it completely misses all of it's target audiences. The writers wanted to take the story of Jack & The Beanstalk and adapt it for more mature audiences. Parts of it almost seemed like they were looking to make it an epic adventure, like the Lord of The Rings, but the Lord of The Rings it is not. The problem with this film is that while they built up the intensity, they didn't go far enough to make adults want to see it. On the flip side, with all the added death and violence, it garnered a PG-13 rating, which meant that younger kids weren't going to see it either. Personally, I liked what they did with the story and I think Nicholas Hoult is a terrific actor, but the way they wrote this film was just a disaster waiting to happen. When they build up the suspense and something is about to happen, they don't show it, because it would be too intense for the kids. When they go the comedic route, the fart jokes, bees in the helmet, and gigantic bad breath is a turn off to the adults. At times I felt like I was watching a kids movie, while at other times I felt as though I was watching one of these three an a half hour epic trilogies. The film couldn't decide how it wanted to go and as a result, it didn't appeal to very many. You can't argue the fact that the film bombed at the box office and I think you can't argue the fact that it did so for a good reason.",1380412800,,1716,4.1101190476190474
4973315,2,B00683T5L8,"Great animation (if you're into that), but the movie itself is boring.  It has a lot of machismo, so guys would probably like it.  By this I mean, there's a lot of males trying to prove they're ""the boss"" by beating each other up; and there's a young woman who acts like a typical male who's full himself -- i.e., she goes against her father and sets out to prove she's tougher than he thinks and she can take care of herself, only to be rescued in the end by, you guessed it, Jack.",1380412800,,482,4.117021276595745

Any of these choices would have been fine, but for some reason the director decided to do all 3, so you end up getting this hodge podge movie that really stretches attempting to appeal to all audiences. It's a decent movie, but mediocre at best on its delivery.",1379548800,,420,4.5394736842105265

As I watched the film I was torn between whether this movie was for adults or children.  It seemed at times like the fairy tale and at other times with an adult twist to the film due to some of the violence.  It seemed a little dark and violent for children so I would not recommend it for very little children.

The acting was well done and the actors in the film did an excellent job of portraying their roles.  The special effects were outstanding and the good acting made the film entertaining for all ages and ultimately I felt it was between a 4 and a 5 star family movie.

I was expecting to have to endure another completely predictable, totally unimaginative and derivative script written by greedy Hollywood executives. To my complete surprise, however, both my son and I were kept on the edge of our seats the whole movie. What a clever interpretation of the Jack and the Beanstalk story! It is not without its flaws. The dialogue was too modernistic for my taste, and the depiction of social class relations was anachronistic. But, despite that, the story was fantastic.

""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is an entertaining update of the classic fairy tale in which a Medieval lad by the name of Jack (Nicholas Hoult) acquires a handful of magic beans that sprout into massive stalks, leading him to a race of giants that live in the clouds.

Directed by Bryan Singer, the movie boasts a likable cast (Eleanor Tomlinson, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci, Ian McShane), spectacular production design and special effects, and an action-packed screenplay that doesn't forget to take time out for a little humor and romance along the way.

You won't remember a thing about it five minutes after it's over, but it should keep you entertained for the duration.",1378252800,,677,4.921052631578948

While I didn't have super high expectations, I rented this on amazon to watch with my family of 5 and the gore was over the top for my 5 and 6 year old daughters to sit through. I see no reason why it was necessary to have eyeballs popping out and heads being ripped off all while being advertised as a children's movie.

I'm not one of those people who think that gore is a major issue but when it's over the top I can't help but advise other parents that they may want to preview it before letting their little ones watch it. Cheers.",1378166400,,608,4.1525423728813555

Surviving a fall from such great heights on the beanstalk falling quickly from the sky, and surviving without a scratch: that is a bit much for me. And the insta-beanstalk that grows in the belly of a giant... its like the stories my folks would tell me when I swallowed apple or watermelon seeds; you'll grow a tree in your belly. Rubbish!

Way too much in the film was coincidence. Too much was aligned too well for this to be enjoyable. ""It looks like doom for him, but whats this!? Random even is working just so specifically, its as if it was placed there on purpose!"" Way to ruin the fantasy and remind me there is a film maker out there.

I also hated how the strong female was not-so-strong once there was a male around. Biggest issue with fantasy films: they have a case of the chronic weak women.

I guess it's meant to be a fairy tale for adults with adult themes maybe trying to remind us that the original Grimm tales really were a bit grim.  However, it comes across as just too much casual brutality even though it's all CG which detracts from the wonder of the fairy tale it's supposed to be.  It just took itself too seriously.  There are a few lighter moments, but not enough to balance the remainder of the story",1376524800,,488,4.329670329670329

He does and all live happily ever after...unless the kingdom was wiped out by the Black Plauge..we are not given privy to that information but we do get to see a lot of giants.  They are mean, smelly and uncivilized...and they throw a lot of trees and cows and stuff at our erstwhile heroes trying to defend the castle. They could have used some help from Thor and the Avengers or even the Transformers but they were occupied with other missions...in another time...lol!

JACK the GIANT SLAYER is a nice flight of the imagination and exercise in fairly mindless--though far from stupid--entertainment. The film has a Disney-like flavor, and though it makes only a half-hearted attempt to convey the medieval setting, the cinematography is very fine. Good performances by Hoult, Tomlinson, and McGregor.

The story may be missing a piece or two, and the modern day ending is a bit tacked-on. There's an interesting mythos here, but its underdevelopment is  dissatisfying. Nevertheless, it's clear from the beginning that this is not a film to take too seriously: Simply fun to watch for children of all ages.",1376265600,,648,5.152380952380953

4973642,3,B00683T5L8,If you are 9-13 years old (or think like one) than this movie is a go. Lots of gross out humor with the giants. The story involving the humans is mildly interesting and very predictable. Ian McShane is totally wasted here as the out-of-touch king. And of course the princess is going to fall in love with the wrong sort of guy.  Seemed to me that the story line wasn't too well thought out and the last 1/4 of the movie was an add-on after they realized the film was too short.,1376179200,,477,4.184782608695652

4973687,4,B00683T5L8,"From the opening scene,a young boy begging his father for a bedtime story to the pleasingly surprise ending, Bryan Singer has magically transformed the telling of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" into an incredible cinematic adventure with all the action and thrills imaginable! Utilizing today's CGI (ingeniously but not too overdone), good old fashioned acting (believable dialogue laced with humorous reparte between the characters, void of the tiresome clichs)lavish costumes, believable locales and sets, and an ensemble of fresh new faces (Nicholas Hoult as Jack, Eleanor Tomlinson as the Princess) we are taken back to a time of Kings, Castles and the myth of a banished race, the Giants ......the story does not stray too far from its original telling but focuses on those elements that beckon the return of these gargantuan creatures (each so grotesque in their appearance and evil in their intentions, masterfully portrayed in this story) and the Fairytale romance between a Princess and a commoner, the Farmer's son.  The Beanstalk itself, a spectacular design of special effects, is an unbelievable enormous growth of twisted, tortuous, twining tentacles that ascends from one magic bean- growing upwards into the clouds as the portal into the land of the Giants. Here we see a hierarchy within the Giant culture...a simmering conflict between the two headed (ingenious!) leader and his rival who desires to be King of the cretins.  There is a clever use of overlapping dialogue that stitches one scene to another into brilliant, believable conversations and surprises! Subtle colors, candlelit interior scenes add to the frightening and ominous events that occur thruout this spectacular film....the action scenes almost rule the film but for the Actors (the King, regally played by Ian McShane-what a scene stealer! the Protector, Ewan Macgregor-dashing, fearless and a potential suitor for the princess, the General-monacled and reminiscent of a German Kaiser in uniform and demeanor; and, of course, the Giants themselves-each markedly different in appearance and mentality with just enough humor to allow viewing by younger audiences) Oh yes, there is somewhat of a surprise ending with a twist provided by Mr. Singer-- remember the evil Lord Roderick? I was thoroughly entertained and treated to feast of deliciously devilish villians, creatures and a believable plot.....you need to experience this wonderful film....how about this weekend?  Perhaps a gathering of pillows on the floor, a large bowl of popcorn, all the kids and SHHHHHHH! the movie's starting........",1375920000,3,2578,5.44

I think the Giants got the wrong end of the stick in this telling of the tale. But then don't they always? Just watch the 50's classics,""Attack of the 50 Foot Woman"".

4973724,3,B00683T5L8,"We sure have been getting a lot of reinterpretations of classic fantasy tales lately, haven't we?  Jack the Giant Slayer is a movie that strives to follow in the footsteps of The Princess Bride but falters.  It's not that it necessarily is a bad movie, it just doesn't fully realize its goals.  That's the main thing I walked away with after seeing Jack the Giant Slayer.

The story, naturally, is an action centric retelling of the classic Jack and the Beanstalk.  Naturally the story centers on Jack (Nicholas Hoult) a farm boy who comes by some magic beans.  One rainy evening the princess of the kingdom runs away from home and winds up in Jack's house to escape the rain.  Before the two can get to better know one another the rain activates the beans which take the princess away to the land of giants far above the clouds.  Determined to save the princess Jack joins the knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) and his men to climb the beanstalk and rescue the princess.

If you couldn't tell already this is a silly movie.  The plot is silly, the characters are over the top, and the special effects are cartoony.  That's clearly what the movie is going for, but if reading that immediately turns you off from it than I doubt you'll have much fun with Jack the Giant Slayer.

Bryan Singer is a talented director, but the film just doesn't have enough substance to hit home.  There is humor, and occasionally some good bits of action, but the plot is predictable, and there isn't enough material for the cast to work with.  There are moments that work where you as a viewer really can see what the filmmakers were going for, but these moments are too few.

Ewan McGregor is the shining light of the film.  As the knight Elmont, McGregor completely steals the show.  Watching McGregor's performance you can see what the movie was striving for, and if script and everyone else in the cast could match him the film would have been a lot better.  It's the kind of ""I've seen everything and never panic no matter the situation"" type character and its clear McGregor has a blast from start to finish.  He's having fun, and I as a viewer was having fun with him.  So if you're at all a fan of Ewan McGregor Jack the Giant Slayer is worth a watch.

Jack the Giant Slayer doesn't come anywhere close to reaching the lofty standards of The Princess Bride, but I didn't regret watching it.  There's some decent action here, some good visuals there, and Ewan McGregor's performance is fun.  If you're into light fantasy adventures or have kids around the age of 10 or so the movie is fun, but know that there are better options out there.",1375660800,,2623,4.522292993630574

4973774,4,B00683T5L8,"If there is something that films are missing in today's world, it is a sense of ADVENTURE. That feeling you felt as a kid after you watched The Lone Ranger or Zorro on television, or Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Lord of the Rings. Those are the kinds of movies that make you want to go out and do something heroic and daring.

Jack the Giant Slayer, for the briefest of moments, captured that adventure.

A pity, then, that it's screenplay was poor, it's dialogue was clunky, and that it was overloaded with CGI, though, admittedly, it was good CGI. Let me list some cons. The screenplay is filled with plot holes, from melting down a giant's heart to make a crown, to the incredibly short time it took Jack, Elmont, and company to climb the beanstalk. The dialogue is often stilted and unnatural, though the one-liners are suitably heroic (I loved Eddie Marsan's line ""Choke on my bones!""). There is a Deux ex Machina so implausible it almost ruins the movie. Bryan Singer, an indisputably great director -- if only for the brilliant&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Usual-Suspects/dp/B00101ZOTA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Usual Suspects</a>, shows a peculiar lack of restraint here. There is so much CGI on display here it makes The Hobbit and Man of Steel look almost subtle.

Admittedly, the giant's animation and rendering _was_ very good. They were so hideous and disturbing you could almost smell them. But too much of a good thing is not wonderful. It is childish. And Jack the Giant Slayer is a very childish movie. Other cons include a sag in pace towards the middle of the film, and just way too many bodily humour/gross out gags, courtesy of the hideous giants.

But hey, who says childish is bad? This is a movie based off of a magic children's fairy tale. I wasn't expecting the next Lord of the Rings here! Jack the Giant Slayer is entertaining in it's own right.

First off, I was very impressed by the cast. Nicholas Hoult is perfect as the brave farmboy turned hero, adeptly mastering the awkward bravery and charm of Jack. Eleanor Tomlinson wasn't bad either, but her character lacked depth, foregoing a personality for lots of screams during action scenes. Stanley Tucci, on the other hand, is so deliciously evil you could almost sense him twirling his moustache offscreen. Can you say SCENE STEALER? This is another case of a good actor saving a thin story. As a worthy foe to Tucci's treacherous Rodrigo, we have Ewan MacGregor's brave and noble Sir Elmont, who gets most of the best scenes and heroic oneliners. Ian McShane is typically excellent, lending gravitas to his dodgy lines. The biggest surprise for me was Eddie Marsan, who, in his short role, became the coolest guy in the film. I would never have pictured Marsan as an action-hero, but by George is he believable!

And let's not forget Bill Nighy. Nighy is one of the most diverse, distinct, adaptable, and entertaining actors working today. No matter what the quality of the film, you can count on Nighy to turn in a memorable and entertaining performance. He is typically on par as the evil, two-headed giant Fallon.

Second, I was VERY impressed by the costume and set design. Everywhere you look, there is a beautiful, rich, believable, practical, stunning costume, from Jack's muddied leather clothes to the rich golden robes of the King. There was clearly a lot of work put into designing the giants, as each looks distinct and suitable hideous. Their armour, crude but effective, looks believable and realistic. The scenes that take place on Terra Firma are excellently shot. The medieval towns, castles, villages, and camps are all an effective blend of fanciful and realistic.

Third, though there is too much of it, the CGI is still excellent. The giant's are incredibly realized, so finely detailed you can see the pores on their skin, the hairs in their nose, and the little latch that holds their breastplate together. This ""unrealistic realism"" gives the grand battle scenes more effective, as the giants become all the more menacing in our eyes.

That brings us to the climactic battle scene. It was perhaps the high point of the movie; epic, dangerous, explosive, riveting, and fast-paced. The giants were evil and threatening, and the humans were relateable and suitably awesome. Refreshingly, it took place in daylight, and was not soaked in lightning and rain like so many other movies. Let me just say that, while it won't rank in the Top 10 battles anywhere, it was a very fun, effects heavy, completely OTT set piece.

...

In conclusion, Jack the Giant Slayer isn't perfect. It's marketing was poor and therefore, it didn't connect at the box office. Critics slammed it for being predictable, cliched, overloaded with special effects, and childish. Valid points all. But all that criticism was perhaps uncalled for.

Jack the Giant is a fairy tale. It's got the requisite farmboy/hero, princess, gallant knight, evil advisor, and giants that make a fairy tale. Like a fairy tale, we've heard and seen it all before and many of us have grown out of it. But like a fairy tale, Jack the Giant Slayer is beautiful to look at, and the action is the sort of stuff that giants, knights, and a 150 million dollar budget was made for. It even touches us at the heart, sometimes. Other pros include great CGI and a noble cast! The production design is excellent, and John Ottman's score ain't half bad.

So, yeah, it's not perfect. But let yourself go ride with Jack, slay giants, rescue princesses, and have a giant of a time. Four Stars.",1375401600,,5591,4.872631578947368

4973779,2,B00683T5L8,"Maybe great for preteens.  But for adults this is just plain not good.  I was disappointed by the effects, the characters and the action.  So...pretty much everything.

Director Bryan Singer, the man behind X-Men and X2 (the ""good"" movies of the franchise), truly disappointed me with his spin on Jack and the Beanstalk.  Other than a few somewhat funny moments, this movie was simply moderately entertaining and largely a letdown.  This is just my opinion though.  So if you want to cut the criticism short and hear a review from someone who had a more positive experience with this movie, then please read the top rated reviews on Amazon.

This classic tale follows the classic plot points.  Jack trades something for some ""magic beans,"" he's scolded for being stupid by his uncle, the seeds get wet and a bean stalk on steroids lifts his house to the land of giants up in the clouds, and then he faces off against giants.

As Jack, Nicholas Hoult brings a strong sense of purity and goodness as if it came naturally to him.  Despite that, I wasn't otherwise impressed by his performance at all, which is unusual.  I typically very much enjoy his acting.  We quickly meet his love interest, future queen Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), who also fails to impress me and is accidently carried to the land of giants with Jack's house.

A smooth, well-spoken and stylishly haired knight named Elmont (Ewan McGregor) leads a band to rescue Isabelle from the land of giants.  He goes with a company of knights, Jack and Isabelle's extremely unsavory intended husband Roderick (Stanley Tucci).  Roderick slithers his way through the story and manages to do something despicable every step of the way.  He backstabs everybody and sides with the giants to seize King Brahmwell's (Ian McShane) kingdom below for himself.  I was unimpressed with all of these characters.  ALL OF THEM!!!  Sorry.  I call it like I see it.

The giants are led by General Fallon (Bill Nighy).  Bill Nighy normally does great playing evil bad guys (e.g., Underworld, the Pirates franchise).  However, I felt he really missed his regular benchmark here.  Nothing about his character struck me as inhuman except for the CGI that illustrated him on screen.  Speaking of which, the CGI is just ""okay.""  I've seen MUCH better.  I guess it does its job but shows far too strong of a contrast with the non-computer-generated actors and backgrounds.  This goes not only for the giants, but for the fantasy-scapes as well.  Much as General Fallon, the other giants fail to feel like monsters outside of eating humans and their deliberate appearance.  They're simply mean ""giant"" humans and, as a result, were uninteresting.

Sadly, while provoking a few giggles, I didn't care for the action either.  And the ending was just awful.  I can comfortably say that there were only three things that I really liked about this movie.

1)  There's  a knight with a monocle.  That's as random as the Monopoly guy fighting in the UFC.
2)  General Fallon's second head.  It's a brain-damaged, malformed little mongoloid that growls, cackles and mumbles incoherently with a stupid, googly-eyed look on its face at all times.  It reminded me of Gollum.
3)  Ewan McGregor's hair.  I had no idea that fantasy knights had access to decent hair products.",1375315200,,3296,4.873646209386282

Jack the Giant Slayer is a beautiful twist on an old fairy tale with a delicious surprise ending!  I would say that it is like Princess Bride meets the Neverending Story.  It would be a good idea to preview it for younger children, but my 6 and 7 year olds will be watching it (they have also seen all of the Harry Potter, Star Wars, Trilogy of the Ring movies, etc with no ill effects-something about the clearly fantasy aspect of these type movies make them fun to watch but clearly unbelievable I guess).  I highly recommend this one!",1375056000,,621,4.421052631578948

virtually never stop coming, and a lot of imagination went into laying out a plotline that
would absorb all the potential for fantastic visuals. Even the ""real life"" is fun, with a very
good cast. The hero and heroine are beautiful, the giants are colorfully disgusting, the king
is clueless yet committed, and the faithful lieutenant or whatever he is is Ewan McGregor in a
very fashionable beard. And, boy, are the bad guy and his henchman evil. I wouldn't recommend
this film for family viewing, though, as some of the violence will frighten the tots.",1374796800,,650,4.8125

I like how they'd created the Giants and the voice acting done. The General of the Giants has a cool Irish accent. Super battle scenes. Good soundtrack.

I enjoyed the movie very much and was not sorry I paid $3.99 to rent it.  In fact, I watched it more than once before the rent time ran out. Filled with plenty action and who could help but fall in love with Jack the farmer turned giant slayer and the fair maiden princess aids her in time of distress.

4974124,3,B00683T5L8,"The most difficult thing about reviewing new DVDs each week is choosing just which title to write about. While you would love to write about the best film being released it's not always a movie that's easily accessible. So you do the next best thing. You write about the one that will be easily found and probably rented or purchased by more folks than any other. So if you want to know what the best release is this week read what I've written about SOLOMON KANE.

That being said let's take a look at what will probably be the big DVD of the week, JACK THE GIANT SLAYER. Directed by Bryan Singer, the man responsible for the X-Men trilogy, SUPERMAN RETURNS, VALKYRIE and one of my favorite movies, THE USUAL SUSPECTS, brings us a new take on the classic fairy tale that I'm sure we all heard growing up. Trust me when I say this isn't your grandpa's giant killer.

Jack here, played by Nicholas Hoult, is indeed a young farm boy who has fond memories of his mother reading him the fairy tale but who now finds himself living with his uncle and being forced to sell the family horse to get money to fix their home. In town he bumps into a friar on the run from the evil Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci). The friar has stolen some magic beans from Roderick in hopes of preventing him from using them to reach the legendary giants as well as the crown that held them at bay from attacking folks here on Earth. Before he can be caught he entrusts the beans to Jack and tells him to take them to the Abby for safekeeping. Of course Jack's uncle gets mad and tosses the beans at him, several of which fall through the cracks in the floor to the ground in the midst of a terrible rain storm.

Back at the castle Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson) is set to marry Roderick, something she truly does not want to do. But as with all medieval films it seems princesses are nearly always forced into a marriage with someone they don't love to solve problems in the kingdom. This story is no different and that evening Isabell runs away from home. Where does she end up? At Jack's house of course.

Having met earlier in the day, when Jack attempted to save her honor from some ruffians when she was in disguise, the two are drawn to one another but realize that there is no way a princess may marry a commoner. Before their attraction can kick in, the beans hatch and begin lifting the house into the skies. Jack attempts to save Isabell but is tossed from the house before he can do so.

The next day the king's men show, led by knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) head of the elite guard. The king sends Elmont along with Roderick, several guards and Jack who insists on going along. They make the treacherous climb up the beanstalk and find the land that was spoken of in fairy tales, a land where giants actually exist. They also have the uncanny ability to smell out the Englishmen who have made there way upwards.

The rest of the film answers the questions will they escape, will Roderick find the crown and rule over all, will Jack and Isabell find a way around their differences to fulfill true love and will the giants make their way down the beanstalk to attack England? I could answer all of those questions but there is more fun in watching them than reading here about those answers.

The film moves along at a brisk pace, never slacking off or becoming tiresome. The acting by all is well played with McGregor moving comfortably into the swashbuckling hero role he began playing in the STAR WARS films. Hoult does a great job as well as the impressionable Jack and Tomlinson portrays the fair maiden in distress admirably. But while the acting is good it's the special effects folks are waiting for in this movie.

Those special effects live up to all expectations. The giants are all quite believable with each one having their own special characteristics and quirks about them. In the lead is General Fallon, a two headed creature bent on taking back the lower land they once ruled. The beanstalk is also well thought out and offered up in its full glory.

In the end I can say that this film was an enjoyable time, an evening well spent. It offered some new twists to an old tale, some great acting, notable special effects and never attempted to become offensive with gross out jokes or language. There are some violent moments that might bother small children (people being eaten by giants) but I would say the whole family could enjoy this one together. Unless you're the Addams family, in which case you'll want to rent EVIL DEAD.",1374019200,,4536,4.475211608222491

4974155,3,B00683T5L8,"Jack the Giant Slayer is a movie about an ancient war between humans and a race of giants when Jack, a young farmhand fighting for a kingdom and the love of a princess, opens a gateway between the two worlds in this imaginative telling of the old tale.

After watching this movie, I thought that the tale had a lot of imagination and potential but could have been so much more. First the good parts, the special effects were very good and the land of the giants was very well done. I thought Bill Nighty who played the giant Fallon did an excellent job at being the villain. But I thought the love story was not well done and felt a bit impersonal and could have been developed a little better. The other thing to me is that it seems that the violence and action in the movie was toned down to the point of blandness. The movie title was changed from being a Giant Killer to a Giant Slayer and several action sequences seemed to have been cut up to avoid showing the giants eating the humans for example and things like that. I am assuming that they did it that way to make it more of a family oriented movie (with the PG rating) and that's not necessarily a bad thing but I felt that it detracted from the action of the story as the action sequences felt a bit choppy and uneven.

With that being said, Jack the GS is a good family movie although maybe not for the youngest ages. Unfortunately that direction to make it a general audience movie made it less of an adult oriented movie that could have been better overall and probably would have done better in theaters. Ok to watch but not a memorable one.",1374019200,,1607,4.282894736842105

The characters I felt sorry for was the poor little pigs being roasted in pastry, alive. They couldn't at least knock them in the head? Besides that, those 2 little pigs and one human couldn't possibly feed that many giants.

4974199,4,B00683T5L8,"When I saw the previews for this movie in the theater, I thought, ""no chance"".  But after it became available as a rental, I figured I've give it a try because Bryan Singer (X-Men) is attached to it, and Bill Nighy (Davy Jones from the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series) voices the lead bad guy (a two-headed giant who dies an exceptionally unpleasant death at the end).

The thing that impressed me the most about the film is that everyone in it was playing it straight. At no point did I feel that the actors were making fun of themselves, or their material, or of the audience for watching. The action was straightforward and free of super-tight close-ups and night shots that prevent you from seeing what's happening. The actors didn't come across as grim, but they weren't trying to act hip and cool (like they were in the truly awful ""Hansel & Gretel: Witch Hunters"") either; they hit just the right balance and came across as normal people in an inherently absurd situation. It's also worth mentioning that there is a very strong and positive female role model in the character of the princess.

All in all, worth viewing. It's much better than the previews might have led you to expect!",1373760000,2,1194,4.622641509433962
4974200,4,B00683T5L8,"I thought Jack the Giant Slayer was a pretty good flick considering it's genre. Many times a movie of this caliber doesn't measure up to the hype that precludes it's release. It's not a movie I'd buy for myself, but I can see myself viewing this movie a few more times once it makes it's way to Netflix since I already have an account there.

4974243,4,B00683T5L8,"A rather tasteful, bloodless version of the famous fairy tale.  It looks lovely and everything runs smoothly (more or less).  The fact that it's pat and perfunctory was its undoing.  I can see why it was a box office dud.  There's very little magic to be had.  The singing harp was present and accounted for but quickly passed over.  Most of the elements one would expect from this story were cast aside for a tiny bit of romance, brief adventure, and an almost epic battle.  It didn't help that the feature began with a whiplash effect between Jack's childhood and that of the princess.  Scenes sped back and forth at an alarming rate, at times the separate conversations folded into one another making it impossible to keep up.  I suppose the director thought this was an interesting gimmick to employ but the result was entirely too cute and confusing.  An odd choice considering the admonishment that was used on Jack ad nauseam: ""don't get distracted!""  Very little imagination went into the making of this movie.  My biggest complaint remains, it was too darn tame (practically sanitized to death).  I expected more backbone, especially considering the subject matter.  As for the cast, Nicholas Hoult made a decent Jack, Eleanor Tomlinson was a lovely princess, and Ian McShane was perfectly cast as the king.  I smiled when I heard Bill Nighy's voice for half of the two-headed giant.  But I couldn't understand why Ewan McGregor deigned to play such a lackluster role that anyone could have done.  The same goes for Stanly Tucci as the villain Lord Roderick (a villainous creature from first to last and yet all of the characters voiced surprise to learn that he was a megalomaniac only out for personal gain!).

At worst, this was just a pleasant diversion that should have been a lot better.  At any rate, I enjoyed it enough that I wouldn't mind watching it again someday.  It's a keeper.",1373673600,,1900,4.769938650306749

It is truly action adventure.  There are parts that are played where the individuals are very noble.  This is truly a fairy tale and it is played out that way.  There is some great acting and some very good lines.  I am not sure why more people do not like this movie.  They have left an ending where there could be a second movie but my guess is not because it did not make a ton of money.

It was an interesting retelling of a well-known story, and I thought the concept was very good; however, it just seemed like there was a little something missing in the execution that I couldn't put my finger on.  When you see a movie like this, you have a greater appreciation for how much Peter Jackson is able to cram into each of his movies without losing any vital plot nuances, but without feeling rushed (of course his usually last three hours).

4974374,5,B00683T5L8,Wasn't sure if I'd like this one but it was spectacular.  The story moved from start to finish seamlessly.  The bad guys got their just deserts.  Wonderful happy ending that satisfied.  A delightful movie and we enjoyed every minute.  Good acting and beautifully presented.,1373241600,,273,5.113636363636363

I enjoyed it and by chance had streamed shortly after another movie called ""Warm Bodies."" The lead who played Jack is also in the other movie and I believe he does far better in ""Warm Bodies"" than in Jack the Giant Slayer.

The visuals of the movies are nicely done, the writing is a mixed bag and at times it isn't clear if this is really a fantasy with drama or approaching the edge of camp with some of the elected to use humour to offset intensity. Again, I did enjoy the movie but would only recommend it to friends who like fantasy films in general.",1373241600,,643,4.103174603174603

4974391,5,B00683T5L8,"Loved this movie, lots of special effects to bring new perspective to an old fairy tale, love it when an old fairy tale gets redone over and over from different viewpoints, they should make more of these for the whole family to enjoy, i think they should take it further and make a series of it.",1373155200,,295,4.285714285714286

4974421,3,B00683T5L8,"Knowing the story, I thought this would be interesting.. Hollywierd went a bit too far in trying to make this into a NEW childhood story. At times it felt they lost their way, and I know they had to build up on a short story but come-on, they missed the key parts by focusing on the giants and grossness.",1373068800,,304,4.169491525423729
4974432,4,B00683T5L8,"It's rare to see a adventure movie that still believes in magic, and it's even rarer to see a fairy tale be done so well.

4974433,1,B00683T5L8,"Viewed via Xbox.  The movie never reached HD quality- very disappointed.  Xbox was wired, I subscribe to 15mbps service (speedtest.net rates it around 10mbps when the movie was showing), and I've watched plenty of other movies and tv shows in HD with other services using the same connection.  Thought I would give Amazon a shot since the rental was a little cheaper.  In the future I'll be using Xbox Video, Vudu, Apple TV, or one of the many other options available to me.  I recommend that others do the same!

Wish it would have at least given me the option do a delayed start to ensure HD- especially since Amazon had HD plastered all over the rental (or if it was available it sure isn't easy to find).  Also wish I would have checked around a little more before I rented.  It doesn't seem to be and isolated issue.  Buyer beware.",1372982400,,836,4.483443708609271

Jack was cute, the princess was okay, the guards, sorry all but one died, the evil advisor did die, hurray.  The bean stalk, that was the only thing that I thought was good about this film and this is not a kid film.

I haven't watch the 3D version yet but I'm willing to bet it will spectacular. The Ebdind could've been 10 to 15 minutes longer but in all a really good film with a good story, effects, acting, directing & amazement truly worth watching.",1372982400,,595,4.622641509433962

Yes he was right most of the time, but didn't know how it would be portrayed on the screen.

Yes the script introduces elements and never revisits them (i.e. Jack finding the treasure horde)

Yes the movie starts off interesting in the telling of the history. Much better than normal narration of what came before. Nearly as good as the Princess Bride and catching us up with the story of the characters in that movie.

Yes Ewan McGregor is clearly a likeable character and he did well in the role.

Yes Nicholas Hout was a good, believable Jack, who's courage outweighs his fears and ineptitude.

No, I'm not sure if I liked Eleanor Tomlinson as Isabelle. I think she was cast alright, but they made a point in the movie how she's not so ""fragile"" and can handle adventure but other than wearing armor she needs Jack's protection throughout. Character was inconsistent.

OVERALL: Good clean family fun. All the ""killing"" is pretty much off-screen though you know it happens. Kids liked it and our visiting international exchange student was able to follow along with subtitles (can read English better than speak or understand spoken) and so the movie was better than okay for us.",1372809600,,1245,4.736111111111111

Maybe some of the dialouge was a little hard to understand; from the giants, but the 2nd time around I understood the talking better. I would rate the Special Effects a 10, & the Scenery, Costumes of the time period were amazeing. I would most definitely reccomend this movie to anyone.",1372723200,,621,4.254237288135593

4974563,5,B00683T5L8,This was a cool fantasy movie. The interpretation of how the story line goes compaed to what most kids had grown up to know was very interesting.,1372636800,,145,4.407407407407407
4974564,4,B00683T5L8,"reasonable good take on the classic story. animations of the giants is first rate, not so much when they interact with humans in the fight scenes. some glitches in the story like whatever happened to the bean stalk that falls and almost smashes the castle? lots of action after the first 20 minutes of context between Jack and princess. Would watch it again when it comes out on netflix or redbox, streamed well the first time on our playstation, not so later on the computer",1372636800,,475,4.6

Just once is enough to put the fear into it. This film just seemed gratuitous with it. The film makers should have focused more on story and less on the gore.",1372636800,,331,4.1875

4974602,3,B00683T5L8,....it's a decent watch. A well-done production will often save a weak script in this type of far-fetched premise. This is an example.,1372550400,,134,4.869565217391305

This is a great family movie, i agree that it is a great cinema version of a story that we grew up reading as kids. Funny, nail biting; the giants are disgusting things. I am going to purchase it!.

I can see where it would of made the experience even better.  It's a must see and the story follows the original (that we all grew up with Jack and the Beanstalk)_ close and yet adds its own touch to make the story more interesting.,1372464000,,406,4.10126582278481

  The story, while familiar, was given some unique twists. The photography was good, and the sound level was consistent, which is great. Some movies you have to scramble for the remote to turn the volume up to head dialogue.
  Of course when it comes to dialogue, Shakespeare it ain't, but there were a few good lines.
  The best part of the movie for me was that there were about a hundred opportunities to make political comments during it. It seems that incompetency and bungling of responsibility isn't confined to the here and now.
  On the whole, I liked it,",1372464000,,611,4.644859813084112

I loved it, hubby came in to respond to my ""Yikes"" and ""OMG's"", and stayed to finish the film with me. Tonight we are planning on watching the entire film together. I thought the CGI was great, the plot fun, scary, at times yucky, yet true to the original storyline that I still remember from my childhood and I am hoping that the ending may lead to another film being made related to this one:)

The great thing about grabbing a movie from Amazon as we did with this one is that it's no longer a big gamble at the theater in terms of cost, so based on that alone I felt it was just OK.

It follows almost the same good vs. evil plot with a love story thrown in to keep everyone happy, except much better special effects. As a bonus, it's also well-acted. Nicholas Hoult plays Jack with an innocence and ""every man"" sort of heroism, and Ewan McGregor is almost unrecognizable as the head guard.  The grotesqueness of the giants - not just how they look, but the things that they do and eat (hint: 2 legs, 2 arms, walks upright, evolved from chimpanzees, rhymes with Neumann) - is worth the price of admission. To boot, you also get a decent storyline that changes the original ""Jack and the beanstalk"" story enough to feel original and so that a big budget, effects-filled blockbuster action movie can fit within the plot.  There's a little bit of campiness thrown in to show that the movie doesn't take itself too seriously...Ewan McGregor plays these parts just right, as does Stanley Tucci. It's an enjoyable movie that doesn't take itself too seriously. I'd give it 7/10.",1371945600,2,1103,4.830687830687831

Director: Bryan Singer
Writers: Darren Lemke and Christopher McQuarrie (screenplay)
Stars: Nicholas Hoult, Eleanor Tomlinson, Ewan McGregor, Stanley Tucci

An excellent fantasy movie that the trailers don't do justice, but the reviews will give you a good idea.  This has far more depth than I expected.  Although the special effects are great, the movie has a good story, action, romance, horror, and more.  Loosely following the fairytale ""Jack and the Beanstalk"", Jack receives magic beans for the sale of a horse (cow in the fairytale), but the similarity ends there.  Oh sure there is an ornate egg, but not solid gold and no goose that laid it.  Nonetheless a great story and script, wonderful casting, exceptional acting, superb directing, excellent  F/X, and lovely music.  Jack's uncle is mad with him taking beans for his horse, and throws them on the floor.  One goes through the floor and grows.  While the princess visits him for an earlier rescue she ends up in his house at the top of a beanstalk in the land of horrible giants.  Jack informs the king and a group of soldiers are sent to rescue her.  So as not to spoil the rest, suffice it to say the movie is well worth viewing and owning and I plan to get the Blu-ray once it drops from the absolutley ridiculous price of about thirty-five dollars to under fifteen dollars.

The story of a Kingdom, a beanstalk, Giants, a Princess and a guy named Jack.

The Princess: Beautiful and kind. She was looking for an adventure and she got one.

Jack: A farm boy with a noble heart. A very likeable hero.

Leader of the Giants: Two heads are better than one.

Magical beans: Beans, beans, the magical fruit, the more ya eat the more ya.......well, just ask the Giant King.

4974878,4,B00683T5L8,"4.3 stars

I was halfway into this before I realized how little harsh violence there was. Tons of action, but little of it results in blood and gore. Which is a welcome relief from the constant violence in most movies these days, even kids' films. The script is good, plenty of humor, the acting is solid, especially Hoult and McGregor, and the effects are very convincing.

All in all, this was a very pleasant surprise and lots of fun. I'd think it would be perfect for most families, as the fairy tale romance is light fun and the action is too. Other than a few folks falling off the beanstalk and a bunch of giants who get wacked in mostly humorous ways, there's little to squirm at for most kids. Considering what they get on tv now, this is in fact thoroughly wholesome fare.

It looks crisp in a good blu-ray transfer, and the extras are slim but ok, including a little game that's ridiculously easy to win, but worth playing, because the ""prize"" is a five minute short on the pre-history of the story, a cartoon narrated by the great Ian McShane, the Morgan Freeman of Britain and then some. He might be the best voice-over guy of them all, actually. That short is worth seeing, as it seems like it was the explanatory prequel they made for the film and then decided not to use. If you like McShane and good animation, be sure to play the climb the beanstalk game and check it out, it's quite well done.",1371859200,,1412,4.402298850574713
4974879,4,B00683T5L8,"This movie will not win any awards. But it is a perfectly fun movie. I admire the CGI, the story line, and the overall tone it has as a movie. Is it the best? Again no it is not. But its a great adaptation of the story of Jack & The Beanstalk.

Jack The Giant Slayer stars Nicholas Hoult (Beast in X-Men First Class) as Jack. He is a young farm boy who, while trying to sell a horse, is abruptly put into a situation with a lovely princess played by Elanor Tomlinson. Now, be mindful it is not until after these course of events that Jack is given a mysterious bag of beans by a monk, and therefore begins a movie that is not only engrossing as it is funny, but the actors do one heck of a job bringing Jack the Giant Slayer to life.

Ewan Mcgregor plays Elmont; his acting helped this movie a lot. We have Stanley Tucci as Lord Roderick (there has to be a bad guy in the midst). Also we have Ian Mcshane(played Blackbeard in Pirates of the Caribbean 4) as King Brahmwell. As I previously  said, the acting in Jack The Giant Slayer is really good.

I enjoyed and had a good time with this movie. Bryan Singer is one really good director,(notably with the first two X-Men movies) and while this is not a highlight in his career or a A+ movie, Jack the Giant Slayer should not be ignored. My final rating is:

4974894,5,B00683T5L8,"I really enjoyed this movie and wanted to start off by saying that the 3D version is the way to go with this movie and I will go into a little more detail on the 3D later, but first the story.

This movie is a re-imagining of Jack and the Beanstalk. Jack, played by Nicholas Hoult (Warm Bodies, X-Men: First Class), who grows up listening to the story of Giants that live on a land in the sky and come down to earth by beanstalks that grow from magic beans, and have a hunger for humans. Erik the king makes a crown from the heart of a giant, and whoever has the crown has the power over the giants. With the use of the crown king Erik sends the giants back to the land and the sky and chops down the beanstalk so they cannot return. Upon king Erik's death the crown and magic beans are buried with him, or so the story goes.

The movie then picks up with Jack now 18 and living with his uncle, played by Christopher Fairbank (The Fifth Element, Batman), due to both his parents being deceased. When Jack's uncle sends him to town to sell a horse and cart he meets and saves the princess Isabelle, played by Eleanor Tomlinson (Alice in Wonderland). While trying to sell his horse after saving the princess and having his cart stolen, he runs into a monk, whose has stolen the beans and is being sought after by the kings most trusted adviser Roderick, played by Stanley Tucci (The Hunger Games, Captain America: The First Avenger). In exchange for the horse the monk gives Jack the magic beans. When Jack returns home with the beans and no money his uncle becomes upset with Jack and spills the beans on the floor. One bean falls in a crack in the floorboard. Later that night a bad storm hits, and well I guess you know what happens when the bean gets wet and this is where the movie really starts to take off.

The cast did a terrific job and, there are alot of good actors, besides the ones I mentioned above. Ewan McGregor (Star Wars Episode 2&3) plays Elmont, Bill Nighy (Underworld) plays General Fallon, Ian McShane (Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides) plays the king, and the list goes on. They did a wonderful job casting this movie.

The visuals were really well done also. The landscapes looked really vast and beautiful. The land in the sky was really awesome and I loved the waterfall. The giants are really well detailed, right down to the hair on their noses. I also like the POV shots from the giants perspective, it really gives you a since of how tall the giants are.

The 3D was really well done and like I mentioned earlier, it is definitely the way to watch this movie. The depth is nicely done and adds alot to the film, especially in the POV shots I talked about above from the giants perspective and also with the landscapes. There are also some nice pop outs here and there, mostly flying debris, but it all helps to just immerse you into the movie.

Overall this movie was a great experience and should definitely be recommended. If you have a 3D setup you have to watch it in 3D, I just can't stress that enough. If you don't have a 3D setup this movie is still worth checking out. If you enjoyed Lord of the Rings you will definitely enjoy this, because it has a Lord of the Rings feel to it, with the story and the vast landscapes. Anyway be sure to check this one out, you won't be disappointed!",1371859200,6,3334,4.3264

While Nicholas Hoult and Eleanor Tomlinson are appropriately squeaky clean as Jack and Isabelle, they are also quite dull...not so much their acting, but the script gives the best roles to the secondary performers:  Ewan McGregor doing a smart Deppish flair as heroic Elmont; Stanley Tucci's foppish turn as the diabolical Roderick; Ian McShane, Bill Nighy, John Kassir....all get scene stealing moments.

The acting was pretty good, everyone did a fine job, the characters were believable in their individual roles. Ewan McGregor (swoon) was, as usual excellent.
The music was great and fit the mood and scenes.
The special effects were very good, maybe not awe-inspiring-blow-you-away kind, but they were still very good.
For parents:
I understand why this film is rated PG-13....while there is no 'bloody' scenes (people get stabbed but you see no blood), there is a heck of a lot of very gruesome and violent scenes....yes, I know it's about giants vs humans so it is to be expected - but some of the scenes went a bit too far in the gore factor (just my personal feelings on it). Pretty big body count.
There are some use of foul language as well, what many call 'mild bad words', but they are few. There is one scene where a giant makes a sound/says a word (like in another language) that sounds like the 'F' bomb, not saying that is what he said, but the word so closely resembled it that it took me by surprise.
I would not recommend this film for anyone under the age of 13/14 (even then it's still questionable), so the rating is fitting.
It wasn't bad, but it wasn't really great either.",1371600000,,1446,4.522900763358779
4974951,4,B00683T5L8,"Didn't expect much...possible something like the the original story that we all
have heard through our youth... But no, this has the feeling like the movie
Jack the Giant Killer, which was done years ago on a limited budget. So with a
bigger budget, we have a great looking castle, soldiers and entourage, and for what it is, a pretty good story. And they could have ended the movie at different parts
like most cheap companies would do...but they decided to add to the movie and
make the ending even more interesting....love the battles...love the giants and
their characters....I have been entertained.

4974972,4,B00683T5L8,"""Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum, I smell the blood.......""

If I were talking to inquiring parents with young children I would say that this is no Disney telling of ""Jack and the Beanstalk"". The film would have been pretty terrifying to me as a youngster (but no less enjoyable). I don't recall them showing anyone being eaten but the viewer, even the very young will undoubtedly realize that this is occurring. The giant ""General"" is extreme and even to this horror-film veteran his creepy 'sidekick' had an effect - it was grotesque and disturbing actually (the film ""Basket Case"" comes to mind.....seriously). There is definitely an end-to-all-good-things scenario going on - a literal devouring of Man - and PG-13 is an accurate rating although my parents would have rightfully let me watch it much younger but it depends on the child. My nephew is ten and he would not enjoy the intensity and fright at all.

The theme of gallantry is apparent as is the universal fight against brutes. The heroes, villains, and monsters are there for those who want to simply watch a fairy-tale come to life visually in front of them.

The scale of the film at times achieves the epic and I thought the giants looked great as did the effects in general. There are some heart-racing moments involving the many giants - some pretty impressive scenes. The human characters are classic, including a princess, but it's not cheesy although all is quite predictable regarding them, their motives, and their actions.

I enjoyed this film but I do like a fantasy from time to time.",1371600000,4,1544,4.837121212121212

4974978,4,B00683T5L8,"Bryan Singer has never been a filmmaker whose work I've celebrated and adored. It's not that his films aren't entertaining to some degree. However, they always seem to have an issue with pacing, which could just as well be blamed on the writers he chooses to work with. Most of them feel as if they lose their footing in the last act. His latest movie, ""Jack The Giant Slayer"" is no different.

A younger farmer named Jack (Nicholas Hoult) accidently drops a magic bean under the floorboard of his shack, resulting in a monstrous beanstalk growing into the heavens and bridging the gap between a world of giants and the Earth. The giants want their land back, which was taken from them in battle centuries before. When a princess is caught by the vengeful behemoths, Jack joins the King's(Ian McShane) rescue team to get her back.

""Jack The Giant Slayer"" starts off well enough and establishes all the important characters and their motivations. Screenwriters Darren Lemke, Christopher McQuarrie, and Dan Studney even set up a solid foundation for their story to be told through flashbacks to the legendary events of the past that occurred between the giants and the humans.

Instead of building up excitement and tension for the climax to the film, Singer manages to wind things down and then rev them up again. He can't seem to find a satisfying or fluid way to end his films. I ultimately blame this on Singer and not the writers because he's the one constant element of each movie of his this tends to happen with (the first two ""X-Men"" movies come to mind).

The visual effects for ""Jack The Giant Slayer"" look good for the most part. There are spots that could and should have been better. The beanstalks and their foliage definitely looked animated in many scenes. I always walk away from these types of CGI fests wondering why or how filmmakers would leave certain aspects looking the way they do. I know it ultimately all boils down to budget and a production's deadline.

The cast of ""Jack The Giant Slayer"" is filled with talented actors who give their all. Nicholas Hoult is enjoyable and likeable as Jack. Ewan McGregor has a lot of fun with his character of Elmont, the witty and loyal protector of the King and his daughter. Stanley Tucci does an excellent job of making you despise the King's devious confidant, Roderick.

""Jack The Giant Slayer"" is presented in 1080p High Definition 16x9 widescreen (2.41:1). The picture quality is clear and vibrant. The 5.1 surround sound is put to good use through the pounding of the giant's walking, the noises of nature, and other eclectic sound effects.

There's some interesting bonus material included on the Blu-ray version of ""Jack The Giant Slayer."" An interactive feature entitled ""Becoming a Giant Slayer"" sends you up the beanstalk to enjoy eight different behind-the-scenes featurettes. If you want to watch each one, then you must re-climb the beanstalk every time. Five deleted / alternate scenes are included as well. Lastly, we get a gag reel.

""Jack The Giant Slayer"" may lose steam towards the end, but the journey is still exciting and humorous. It's family-friendly fun and blends together fairy tale elements that will appeal to both girls and boys. Fans of damsels in distress and Disney Princesses will be pleased just as much as guys wanting an action-movie fix.",1371513600,5,3342,4.840630472854641

4975092,4,B00683T5L8,"Nicholas Hoult has been knocking my socks off, as an actor, since I saw him on episode one of ""Skins"".  He's so good, and the biggest reason I watched JACK THE GIANT SLAYER - a not-so-modern modern take on the well-known fairy tale ""Jack and the Beanstalk"".  The film opens with Jack as a young boy, where through his father's tales we learn the legend behind the great giants that live far above the earth, and how one day a giant beanstalk enabled them to come down and almost destroy the land ... until a wise-thinking king found a way to forge a crown that kept the giants under his control so he could send them home.

Cut to Jack at 18 (I think).  Orphaned, he now lives with his farmer uncle and works the small plot of land they live on.  But things aren't going well, and Uncle sends Jack to town to sell their one and only horse to buy the materials needed to repair their roof before the rains come.  In town, Jack finds himself taking on ruffians to save a beautiful young woman - Princess Isabelle, the king's daughter, no less - but is having trouble selling the horse until a monk offers him a handful of beans as collateral, telling Jack to come by the monastery later for his payment.  The film, after this, follows form as just one bean that Jack loses track of grows into a monstrous beanstalk - and when Isabelle is trapped in it, Jack insinuates himself into the search party the king sends out to rescue her (which includes a couple of really bad guys with  more than rescue on their minds).

Even with all the CGI - which I normally hate in abundance like this - the film is fun, entertaining, and provides just enough twists to the original fairy tale while staying very true to it at the same time.  Hoult is great, Eleanor Tomlinson as Isabelle suitably tough yet vulnerable, and both Ewan McGregor (heading the rescue team) and Stanley Tucci (big-time bad guy, here) all make the film one that grabs your attention even as the tension and action both escalate.

There's a couple scenes where the giants eat people and people die, however they do not get up and personal with it so from that perspective it's kid friendly. If I have one gripe on this movie it's not the movie itself but the script. The dialogue never really get's going between characters in this movie and I think that's what is stopping me from giving it the 4 stars that I wanted to.

4975123,3,B00683T5L8,"Rumored that ""Jack"" was doomed to flop, you may assume that going into the film that it may be terrible. That isn't the case. It was just an expensive film to make, approximately $190 million. Based on the fact, that Warner Brothers Studios has numerous movies (""Harry Potter"", ""Dark Knight"", ""The Hobbit"") in its pocket that will make up for whatever loss, if any, ""Jack"" sustains, you should not weep for them. Although, you may consider whether or not to take the time to go see it in theaters or get the bluray/DVD.

Why not! It's a fun movie. Not to mention, it is one of those rare movies that anybody in the family can watch and enjoy. There are some dark moments in the film and some mildly scary moments, but it's all fun. We all know the story of Jack and the Beanstalk and now, with today's incredible technology, we can see this fairy tale, mostly imagined up to this point, in vivid 3-D and live action or CG action.

Director Bryan Singer knows a thing or two about bring us fairy tale characters. He's directed two X-Men films and a Superman film. So, telling the story of Jack and his magical beans is right up his alley. We all know the story and Singer managed to keep those same elements in the film. The best part about ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is the script; until the ending. Most of the time, these type movies are made just to appease the visual desires of a film-goer, but this film has many surprising twists and turns. Although, it isn't without a little bit of criticism from this reviewer.

The first two-thirds of the film are filled with surprises and quality writing that keeps the audience riveted. When the humans enter the world of the giants, I found the whole experience to be incredibly realized and reminiscent of the movie ""King Kong"". It was amazing and frightening at the same time, especially when one giant tracks down a running human as if he were catching a mouse and picked him up as if his catch was pretty much insignificant.

My beef comes from the choices made in the final third of the film. They had built up so much possibility with script direction. There was the world of the giants. There was the love story between Jack and Princess Isabelle. There was the massive treasure that the giants had horded overtime from the humans. Yet, I think that they chose the less interesting of directions for the film. Battle; not in the more interesting giant world, but in the human world. The giants are really just mindlessly driven to battle. They have no heart-filled reason to do so, they just want to destroy and steal. We've seen so many battles on film in so many movies and they are always less interesting than a human motivated storyline. There was a reason for battle in ""Braveheart"". There was a reason for battle in ""Glory"", ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""Saving Private Ryan"", but the reason for this battle was just boring.

""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is a great time at the movies for the whole family, I just wish it had a ending that was as personal and interesting as the rest of the film. Instead, we get an ending that reminded me of Burton's ""Alice and Wonderland""; uninteresting CG junk.",1369699200,67,3150,4.509632224168126
4975124,4,B00683T5L8,"I liked this film and together with my 12 years old daughter we spend a nice moment watching it. It is however definitely not recommended to little children, like 10 and younger. This review contains limited SPOILERS.

This retelling of old tale of Jack and the Beanstalk is pretty well done, with many key ingredients of fairy tales well in place. There is a brave and ultimately quite clever farm boy (Jack), a cute and quite likeable damsel in distress, a noble king, his brave knights, a vilainous treacherous scoundrel, powerful magic items, a really REALLY BAD giant alpha (and beta) and a whole batallion of other giants, almost as dangerous as their two-headed leader.

Past the first 10 minutes, the film is rather quick paced and visually it is very pleasant: the sky domain of giants, the giant beanstalks and the mighty royal fortress are really impressive. The desperate fight of royal army against the giants besieging the great royal castle is a particularly well done thing - I certainly appreciated that both humans and giants fight in a rather logical way and human army is definitely not a push-over...

The best character in the film and a scene stealer is Elmont, a sarcastic noble knight commanding royal guard, played very VERY convincingly by Ewan McGregor who seizes this occasion to remind the public, that he once played Obi-wan Kenobi and that after all he killed Darth Maul and General Grievous and defeated and mutilated Darth Vader... Frankly, I almost expected Elmont to finally use his light-saber and I was very surprised when he didn't...

Stanley Tucci who plays the main villain Roderick is another scene stealer, with his quasi Monty Pythonesque style - it is clear he had tons of fun playing in this film. Ewan Bremer, who plays his slightly deranged murderous sidekick Wicke, is another delight to watch.

Compared to those three characters and to all the gallery of giants, both Jack and the Princess seem a little pale - this is the reason I give this film only four stars instead of five.

Children younger than 11 can find this film TOO SCARY, as there are numerous scenes when giants EAT PEOPLE - and even if there is no gore and everything happens fast and is shown in some distance, the scenes are explicit enough to leave no doubt that a character had just his head and shoulders ripped of the rest of his body and swallowed by a enormous, ugly, very strong, very fast and very agressive monster.

But bottom line, I liked this film and I spend a good moment watching it - and I think we will buy the DVD when it is available. Although not a masterpiece, this is a nice, easy, visually very impressive film.",1369612800,38,2655,4.696774193548387

4975128,2,B00683T5L8,"The fantasy genre has been in a bit of a rut for the past 5 or so years.  The young adult fiction genre is rife with a glut of derivate sword-and-sorcery series looking to piggy-back off of the success of Harry Potter, and they are largely becoming more and more indistinguishable from each other.  A great deal of the film industry's material, unfortunately, also comes from this tired pool of bland teenage protagonists, rehashed plot points and settings, and frequently embarrassing attempts at edginess.  It takes a stellar fantasy film nowadays to be able to be noticed as a gem among slag.

 Jack the Giant Slayer is definitely not one of these films.  It has neither the enthusiasm to be a faithful retelling of the fairy tale, nor does it have the talent backing it to make it an intriguing retelling.  It simply exists, a film that doesn't particularly seem to care if it is watched or not, just as long as it makes Warner Bros. some money.

 While it's doubtful that anyone needs the plot summarized for them, Jack the Giant Slayer stars the titular hero Jack, who does numerous tedious things, meets tedious people, and slays surprisingly few tedious giants.  He is played (tediously), by Nicholas Hoult, who has mastered the art of ""green-screen face"", the act of staring blankly past the camera with a look of slack-jawed not-quite-amazement.  I suspect the producer was dangling his check in front of him.  As you might expect, Jack is given some beans by a monk, the purpose of which is to keep the out of the hands of the nefarious Lord Roderick.  Roderick also happens to be well on his way to marrying the princess, Isabella, and becoming heir to the king's throne.  Despite his all too short amount of screen time, Stanley Tucci does a fantastic job as Roderick, adding some much needed hamminess to a film that takes itself much too seriously.  He's arrogant and outrageous in the classic style of Disney villains, and his scenes are where the film shines brightest.

 The role of love interest is taken by Isabella herself, played by Eleanor Tomlinson.  Much like her co-star, she plays a character as bland as sawdust, leaving no doubt in the viewer's mind that these two tedious characters will likely fall tediously in love, have a tedious wedding by the end of the film, and likely end up with more than one tedious child.  Her dissatisfaction with being made to marry Roderick brings her to Jack's dump of a home, right before he manages to accidently get one of the beans wet, growing a massive beanstalk that carries her away.  Poor guy.

 The king is understandably upset, and sends Jack, Roderick, and Ewan McGregor (playing not-Obi-wan Kenobi) up the beanstalk to retrieve her.  Roderick is all too happy to volunteer, as his plans involve taking control of the hundreds of sky-bound CGI giants, and using them to conquer the kingdom.  While this second act should have been spectacular, considering the expense taken to render the massive environments of the giants' world, nothing in particular really sticks.  Forests and rocky caves are the name of the game here, and there's never anything truly new to look at.  Even the sense of scale is lacking - being in a giant's world should be fascinating to see characters interact with, as even the simplest tasks can be impossible when they suddenly struggle to scale one stair-step.  But despite the fact that this world is built for beings 20 times larger than they are, this size difference is rarely even noticeable.  The film simply doesn't emphasize it, perhaps in an attempt to be as boring as its main character.

 I'll give the film credit for a fine example of faithfulness to the culture and dress of the time period.  Beyond that, the finale is well done, and much better than the boring hour that precedes it.  But none of that can make up for the fact that this is, really, a boring, pointless film.  The story of Jack and the Beanstalk has been told numerous times, from the classic and lovable Disney animated short, to the odd and overlong, but fascinating Jim Henson movie Jack and the Beanstalk: The Real Story.  Jack the Giant Slayer, on the other hand, has neither charm nor a worthwhile thing to add to the story, and no real reason to exist.  Skip it.",1366588800,4,4254,4.71041948579161
4975129,1,B00683T5L8,"There is a whole sub-community of movie executives who will farewell their Hollywood careers when, as most assuredly it will, this film plummets like a clumsy giant out of the sky on its general release to the public.

For, unlike the last film I can remember being this wretched (Danny Glover's Age of the Dragons) Bryan Singer's Jack the Giant Slayer was not released straight to video, its producers having first been taken out and shot.

Here rather more is at stake, at least if the fanfare that accompanied its preview screening is anything to go by. They erected a 20 foot high climbing wall outside the cinema to mark the launch. Since the screening took place in Leicester Square on St. Patrick's Day amidst a throng of drunken Irish revellers, this was a misjudgment all of its own.

Other than Age of the Dragons (and, let's face it, ""Moby Dick. On land. With dragons. Starring Vinnie Jones"" is quite a benchmark), I can't remember a film quite so bankrupt in its basic concept. The idea seems to have been to take anything of note in the fantasy genre of recent times - there are hat tips to The Princess Bride, The Hobbit, How To Train Your Dragon, Beowulf, Prometheus and Immortals among many others - and to stitch them together in the expectation that it might all fly. Jack the Giant Slayer therefore has a cloying excess just about everything.

Except smut. Smut is fully absent without official leave. Great Scott, it's a pantomime! Jack and the Beanstalk begs for double entendre! Its bizarre omission calls to mind Danny McBride's childishly excellent Your Highness, a film almost entirely comprised of innuendo and which, like no other, illustrates just how redemptive a willy joke can be.

In the meantime, the story is a hodgepodge of English fairy tales. Despite being named for ""Jack the Giant Killer"" (""killer"" nixed because the focus group didn't like the word ""killer"" and didn't understand the concept ""synonym"") this is mostly a reprise of Jack & the Beanstalk. Only better, I suspect its screenwriting collective thought (this is a collective whose collected output, by the way, is enough to induce dizziness, cold sweats and vomiting).

And of course it isn't better. It can't be. Jack & The Beanstalk is an archetypal fairy story with the kernel of a decent drama, but in no reasonable man's conception could it stretch for two hours (not, at least, without a cross-dressing Widow Twanky somewhere along the way). So the collective has drowned out the elemental aspects of the story with additional tropes and dog-eared routines of the idiom, whilst egregiously forgetting the all-important transvestitism.

Now excuse a digression into literary theory, but in this fairy story there is a hero (Jack), a monster (one giant), a perfidious interlocutor who, through shortsightedness, meanness, hubris or stupidity provides the impetus for the hero to be uncaged (a stepmother who angrily throws away the beans for which Jack has stupidly traded his cow). It is simple stuff, and has a whopping great cock of metaphor quite literally rooted right in the middle of everything, yet the moral of the story is unusual for a ""hero overcoming the monster"" story: be careful what you wish for. Sometimes your vaulting ambition can come back to bite you. Here the screenplay entirely futzes that simple premise. There are several candidates for villain - an entire tribe of Ulstermen giants (in a land and at the top of a beanstalk, by the way, so graphically rendered as to compel close literal examination of a metaphor which isn't up to such scrutiny. Wouldn't everyone have, like, noticed a huge landmass floating in the sky? Wouldn't it always be dark below? Wouldn't things spontaneously fall off it from time to time (as indeed they start to once the action gets underway)? Would the land below really look just like the Home Counties in summertime?

The screenwriters have invented a backstory for the giants which further compromises the fable. They're subject to a mythical ring (or crown, depending on your hat size), to the bearer of which they must pledge automatic fealty. This allows further candidate for supreme Villain when dastardly Roderick (Stanley Tucci), one of the King's men, gets hold of the ring, waves it at a horde of onrushing giants, and they all at once bow down to him without further discussion.

And just as the giants seem improbably captive of one little midget, director Bryan Singer seems captive of, his special effects department. The film is in 3D, a fad which elsewhere seems thankfully pass, is lit darkly anyway, and they have made the curious decision to entirely animate the giants (per Beowulf, rather than augmenting live performances per Lord of the Rings) using quite dated rendering technology. Perhaps we have reached the limit what the CGI wizards can do, and there is hope for the Film Actors Guild after all. In any case Bill Nighy isn't recognisable as the Giant with the Belfast accent and the extra head.

Meanwhile, our anaemic young hero Jack (Nicholas Hoult) does his best with no obvious fibre and only an anaemic princess (Eleanor Tomlinson) to win over, whom the giants are (specifically, for some reason) hell-bent on eating (notwithstanding that such a skinny little whelp would, to a giant, have the size and consistency of a cockroach).

We arrive at a final dramatic conclusion at the Castle (I know, I know, *what* castle?) wherein King (*what* King?) Brahmwell (Ian McShane), in possibly the most woeful piece of miscasting in motion picture history, is obliged to partake in a twenty minute tug of war with a giant cabbage-patch doll while dressed in a suit of armour made of 24 carat gold lam that even Julian Clary wouldn't be seen dead in. McShane, to his credit, looks singularly unamused, adopting the expression of a Candid Camera victim immediately prior to being let in on the gag.

As of the time of writing the film hadn't recouped half its estimated production costs in a month or so of general American release. Thus I hope Ian McShane and his cohort of celebrated English actors got paid in hard currency in advance - because the merchandising rights ain't going to be worth Jack.

4975130,3,B00683T5L8,"""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is yet another attempt by Hollywood to revamp fairy tales and fantasies by name directors. Tim Burton did it. Sam Raimi, too. Even Terry Gilliam. It's only natural that Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"" ""X-Men"") directs the updated version of the famous fairy tale. And like many previous efforts, the film is visually attractive, but needs better storytelling.

Nicholas Hoult plays a young farm boy Jack, who falls in love with Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), who runs away from the palace. When the Princess has been carried away up into the sky (in a rather contrived fashion), Jack volunteers to join the rescue party including scheming Lord Roderick (Stanley Tucci) and the King's elite guard Elmont (Ewan McGregor).

The story takes too much time to get going, with a prologue about the giants and back stories about the main characters, but once it gets started, the film is entertaining with thrilling action set-pieces, in which human actors, motion-capture giants and CG-created beanstalks blend pretty effectively. Special effects are decent, if not outstanding, and the sceneries and castle of the Kingdom of Cloister are beautiful to see.

For all the enjoyable action sequences, however the film has a feel of ""been there, done that."" Two young stars do their best, but, likeable as they are, the hero and heroine are bland, and I wanted to see more of Ewan McGregor's dashing Elmont, which is the best part of the film.

""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is just an OK adventure film that is in need of creative ideas on how to tell a familiar story. The film needs something creative and unique that is briefly seen in its clever ending.",1364947200,7,1676,4.932624113475177
4975131,4,B00683T5L8,"The story of Jack and his magical beanstalk dates back to Viking times and over the past 1400 years, we have yet to be sick of it.  Countless versions of this story exist in virtually every format of entertainment imaginable.  The story is a good one though and in the hands of the talented director Bryan Singer, this version is certainly one of the best.

Jack the Giant Slayer stars Nicholas Hoult whose star is on the rise.  Fresh off of his other starring role as R in Warm Bodies, Hoult functions well as the underestimated, romantic hero.  The main story is mostly familiar.  Jack is trusted with a task to sell items for money, but he returns home with no money and a handful of ""magic beans.""  The magical properties of the beans are unleashed when they become wet in a rainstorm sending Jack's house, and inadvertently the King's daughter Isabelle, up to a legendary land of giants via a massive beanstalk.  King Brahmwell (Ian McShane) organizes a team to rescue his daughter lead by his trusted knight Elmont (Ewan McGregor) and including Jack as well as the plotting Roderick (Stanley Tucci) who the princess has been promised to for marriage.

The giants are truly spectacular.  They are easily 20 feet tall and have a very clever form of motivation based on a previous war between man and giant, which resulted in them being magically enslaved by a magic crown.  Nonetheless, they are vengeful and dangerous, bringing a real threat of danger and excitement to the story.  Furthermore, Singer allows several opportunities for tongue-in-cheek humor to permeate the already clever adventure story that takes place up the beanstalk.  Simply put, a strong case is made for Stanley Tucci to have a part in every movie.

The only issue the film has going against it lies in its first act.  Singer's film begins a bit slowly with terse voice-over narration of parallel backstories for young Jack and young Isabelle.  The children playing these parts deliver excruciatingly clichd performances, and it was at this point that I admit I was worried.

Consequently, I must pause here to mention that this review comes with a brief stipulation.  When it comes to re-making a fairy-tale, there are many pitfalls that can occur; a major one is choosing the right audience.  Aside from this tepid opening segment, Bryan Singer actually has made a film that would exist more comfortably in Middle Earth than in Disney World.  It embraces its world of man-eating giants and has fun with it.  This decision certainly enhances the film's entertainment value, but it also takes a familiar children's tale and puts it just out of reach for children to enjoy. Creating an opening scene so clearly not in congruence with the rest of the film sets the incorrect initial mood that is hard to shake once the movie gets good.  However, if you can make the leap, this film definitely functions much better as a romantic action film than as a cute and safe children's tale.

That being said, I liked Jack the Giant Slayer.  I also recommend seeing it in 3-D, which is a recommendation I can honestly say I would give to no more than five films.  This is a fun, entertaining, funny, and good looking film that is easy to enjoy once the film figures out what it is and who it's aimed at.  B",1364774400,11,3273,4.708260105448154
4975142,4,B00683T5L8,"I liked this film and together with my 12 years old daughter we spend a nice moment watching it. It is however definitely not recommended to little children, like 10 and younger. This rfeview contains limited SPOILERS.

This retelling of old tale of Jack and the Beanstalk is pretty well done, with many key ingredients of fairy tales well in place. There is a brave and ultimately quite clever farm boy (Jack), a cute and quite likeable damsel in distress, a noble king, his brave knights, a vilainous treacherous scoundrel, powerful magic items, a really REALLY BAD giant alpha (and beta) and a whole batallion of other giants, almost as dangerous as their two-headed leader.

Past the first 10 minutes, the film is rather quick paced and visually it is very pleasant: the sky domain of giants, the giant beanstalks and the mighty royal fortress are really impressive. The desperate fight of royal army against the giants besieging the great royal castle is a particularly well done thing - I certainly appreciated that both humans and giants fight in a rather logical way and human army is definitely not a push-over...

The best character in the film and a scene stealer is Elmont, a sarcastic noble knight commanding royal guard, played very VERY convincingly by Ewan McGregor who seizes this occasion to remind the public, that he once played Obi-wan Kenobi and that after all he killed Darth Maul and General Grievous and defeated and mutilated Darth Vader... Frankly, I almost expected Elmont to finally use his light-saber and I was very surprised when he didn't...

Stanley Tucci who plays the main villain Roderick is another scene stealer, with his quasi Monty Pythonesque style - it is clear he had tons of fun playing in this film. Ewan Bremer, who plays his slightly deranged murderous sidekick Wicke, is another delight to watch.

Compared to those three characters and to all the gallery of giants, both Jack and the Princess seem a little pale - this is the reason I give this film only four stars instead of five.

Children younger than 11 can find this film TOO SCARY, as there are numerous scenes when giants EAT PEOPLE - and even if there is no gore and everything happens fast and is shown in some distance, the scenes are explicit enough to leave no doubt that a character had just his head and shoulders ripped of the rest of his body and swallowed by a enormous, ugly, very strong, very fast and very agressive monster.

But bottom line, I liked this film and I spend a good moment watching it - and I think we will buy the DVD when it is available. Although not a masterpiece, this is a nice, easy, visually very impressive film.",1363996800,7,2656,4.698924731182796
4975143,2,B00683T5L8,"Now that Robert Pattison's big series is over, and he has yet to make a successful film not associated with brooding vampires or hunky werewolves, Hollywood is searching for The Next Big Thing among the pool of eligible young actors.

Enter Nicholas Hoult. Hoult has been around a while, he was literal Boy in ""About a Boy"", starring Hugh Grant as figurative boy and Toni Collette. Now that he is in his twenties, the studios are making a little push to position him as the NBT. He is currently in two big releases, which is a good sign, but only one of them is worth your attention, which is problematic.

It makes sense that Hoult is being groomed for this new role; he's British, not hard on the eyes and he can act. RPats shares two of these three qualities. Slam! Any Twihards reading this review have no doubt clicked ""Not Helpful"" provided they understood the slam. Double Slam!

But back to the reviews.

Bryan Singer's (""The Usual Suspects"", ""X-Men"") new film was originally scheduled for last summer, but Warner Bros. delayed the release to ""enhance the special effects"". It is never a good sign when a studio delays the release of a film. If they liked the film and had confidence in it, they would have stuck to their guns and gone ahead with the release. Instead, they are ""enhancing the effects"" and the marketplace is ""too crowded"".

It's easy to see why the studio lost faith. ""Jack"" isn't very good. A lot of money was spent on the creation of the CGI giants. They look good, but they also look like CGI creations. In a live-action film, CGI should blend in more seamlessly and not look fake and cartoony.

In fact, none of the recent grown-up adaptations of fairy tales has been memorable. ""Red Riding Hood"" is a bad, blatant attempt to capitalize on the success of ""Twilight"", complete with two hunky male leads fighting each other for the girl. Both ""Snow White"" films were problematic; one is too goofy and cornball, the other is anchored by a starlet who can't act working with Charlize Theron who chews the scenery throughout. ""Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters"" (sequel on the way, folks) is a gory revenge tale with a brother and sister with different accents fighting off witches throughout.

The other big use of CGI in the film, the beanstalks, is pretty well done. Somehow, these creations, wild, unpredictable and massive, seem much more real because they don't have any human characteristics.

""Jack"" begins with a flashback - both young Jack and a young Princess Isabelle are told the tale of King Erik who defeats the cannibalistic giants and banishes them to their own land, in the clouds. His magical crown and the beans needed to grow beanstalks that can reach the giant's land are buried with the King. Jack is frightened by the tale which Isabelle embraces as a fairy tale.  Flash forward 10 years and Jack now lives with his Uncle who sends Jack into town to sell their cart and their last horse to help keep their floundering farm afloat. But he is quickly distracted by a young woman watching a panto show. When he realizes she might be in trouble, he tries to help, but the King's guards, Elmont (Ewan McGregor) and Crowe (Eddie Marsan), arrive to save Princess Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson). Roderick (Stanley Tucci), the King's (Ian McShane) advisor, has uncovered the crown and beans and has a secret plan simmering. Long story short, Jack gets hold of the beans and one grows under his Uncle's farmhouse, trapping Isabelle there. Soon, the two world's clash and Wicke (voiced by Ewan Bremmer) leads his giants into battle against the humans.

There is a lot of good production design in ""Jack""; the prologue is illustrated with panto characters, much like the `Deadly Hallows"" sequence in the last ""Harry Potter"" film. And the castle is beautiful. But this is definitely a case of the filmmakers putting all of their eggs in one (or two) baskets. Much of their time and energy was spent on the look, leaving little left for character development or story.

Once the film gets going, it is basically one long chase. The princess gets stuck in Giant Land, leading Jack, Roderick, Elmont and other members of the King's guard to begin climbing the beanstalk. Once there, they try to elude the murderous beasts as they search for the princess. Eventually, they make their way back to the kingdom but giants are fast on their heels and attack the castle, trying to extract their long-gestating revenge. This makes for a fast-paced film, which is good, but does nothing for the characters and doesn't exactly make a complicated or involving story. For instance, when we meet Jack in `Present Day', he is now living with his uncle, but there is never a mention about what happened to his father or how this might have shaped the young man's life.

Princess Isabelle, as played by Eleanor Tomlinson, is completely forgettable. There is an attempt to make her a self-reliant, plucky young royal. The moment we first meet her is a good indicator of how her character is to be viewed; despite her independent nature, she needs to be saved by the Royal Guard, to protect her from an unruly man. Not exactly a great role model for the tweens in the audience. This unfortunately holds true throughout the film because she quickly ends up as a Damsel in Distress, hanging on Jack's arm.

Hoult isn't given much to do. He runs around, trying to evade the giants before he realizes he has to stand up and fight. Naturally, he finds courage he never knew he had when the need arises. Not very interesting. Strangely, his costume in the film looks like it was purchased at Hollister or the Gap; he really looks like he is wearing jeans, a t-shirt and a hoodie. This lack of detail only serves to draw us out of the time, place and story.

McGregor, Tucci, McShane and Marsan are all more interesting than the two leads, but they are also given more to do. McGregor has the swagger and confidence you would expect from the head of the Royal Guard. But he also has a twinkle to his eye that brings in a touch of the comic book superhero. Tucci's Roderick is plotting to overthrow the King while he plays along with King's plans to marry him to Princess Isabelle. It is a funny, strange and interesting role. McShane is perfect as the blustery, unaware monarch. And Marsan plays against type as a member of the Royal Guard.

""Jack the Giant Slayer"" is a very uneven film. If the filmmakers had been as interested in the characters as they were in the special effects, this aspect of the movie would have been greatly improved. As a result, the entire film would have been much better and memorable.

For every NBT to make it through. Hollywood history is littered with thousands of handsome young actors who didn't make a lasting impression. They are given a big push, star in two or three high profile films that flop and then end up starring in a show in the CW. The sad thing is that the failure of these films is not always the actor's fault. Those that can act often get cast in bad films, or poorly marketed films. Cast him in a period costume romance and then a hard hitting urban drama. The tweens who made his first film a huge hit will surely follow and the success will follow. Or not.

I think Hoult can and will rise above the failure of ""Jack""; he got many good reviews for ""Warm Bodies"", he had a small, but interesting role in ""A Single Man"", he was on the BBC version of ""Skins"". In other words, he can act. His agents and handlers just need to steer him away from some of the more iffy blockbusters. If a balance can be reached, Hoult can become a fixture of Hollywood. Hell, he might even end up seated next to Nicholson at a future Oscar ceremony.",1363824000,2,7689,4.6007299270073
4975144,4,B00683T5L8,Jack the Giant Slayer was a lot of really good clean fun with some top notch acting. This beautifully cinematic adventure has several similarities to the classic tale we've all heard but also a lot of really great changes. It is every predictable and very cheesy but it's overall a really great movie to take the family to or if you just want a pleasant night at the movies. There is a considerably high amount of people getting killed or eaten but it's all mostly implied and everything is very light hearted. I would defiantly recommend seeing this.,1363219200,,551,4.63265306122449
4975145,5,B00683T5L8,"""Jack The Giant Slayer"" involves the story of a well- meaning but over-protective man named King Brahmwell(valiantly played by Ian McShane) who seems more concerned about his daughter  Isabelle(strongly played by Eleanor Tomlinson) getting married than allowing her to explore the world around her.  Stanley Tucci plays a discreetly evil assistant to the king, but does a good job of playing it convincingly.  Ewan McGregor also projects a compelling performance in playing the protector of both the King Brahmwell and Princess Isabelle.  Nicholas Hoult plays an innocent and energetic portrayal of Jack. The character of Jack unintentionally changes the life of himself and those around him when he obtains ownership of some magic beans.  ""Jack The Giant Slayer"" is the type of movie to watch for those who are open to the message of how even just one person can drastically shape events for themselves and those around them.",1362960000,,926,5.1879194630872485

4975147,4,B00683T5L8,"Here's a new take on an old tale. Rated PG-13 and directed by Bryan Singer (""X-Men""), this ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" is well cast, visually exciting, and lots of fun. Computer Generated Imaging has made fantasy stories more and more fantastical; this one is mind-boggling.

We admire:
  * Nicholas Hoult (""Warm Bodies"") is resourceful and resolute as Jack, the nice young man who drops a magic bean and... ""Uh oh,"" gets it WET. Later, as he clambers up that amazing beanstalk, he admits he ""doesn't much like heights.""
  * Eleanor Tomlinson (""Alice in Wonderland"") is Isabel, an adventurous princess who finds waaaay more adventure than she bargained for.
  * Ian McShane (""Deadwood"") is the king, ready to marry off his daughter to a much older man in order to achieve peace with a neighboring kingdom. But he pitches right in when his kingdom is under attack.
  * Stanley Tucci (""The Hunger Games"") makes the perfect bridegroom/villain: ambitious, ruthless and cruel. Once he gets the magic crown, the wedding is off!
  * Ewan McGregor (""The Impossible"") is our stalwart guardsman Elmont: organized, decisive and brave. It looks like McGregor enjoys being in a comedy for a change.
  * Bill Nighy (""About Time"") is the lead Giant. He has a little spare head sitting on one shoulder, which offers another point of view.

If you take a 12-year-old boy (the perfect demographic) reassure him that there is less than a minute of ""mush."" Otherwise, it's slam-bang action, with lots of spears, arrows, horses, drawbridges, armor, swords, boiling oil, burning trees and other weapons of the middle ages.

I can't think of a thing I would change; 114 minutes flew by. The battle scenes aren't too long, the giants are appropriately icky, our hero is valiant and the heroine is plucky. We all ducked when a crown bounced into the audience, but beyond that, the story is engaging enough that there should be no need to spring for the extra 3D charge, so a DVD from Amazon will do just fine.",1362873600,83,1981,4.819526627218935
4975148,5,B00683T5L8,"Yes that was cheesy pun on words.  Yes this is 2013's John Carter a poorly marketed mistitled film that was a enjoyable Saturday matinee popcorn movie.  When you go into a movie like this that is a fairy tale you should throw away any notion of realism because it is not suppose to be realistic if that was the case terrifyingly huge talking giants would be real and so would be a magical beanstalk that is a porthole between the two worlds would exist.  I loved the action in this movie, seeing the giants was awesome they looked intimidating which was awesome for a movie like this, and much has been said about the CG job on the giants, what did you want the filmmakers to do to create giants?!  Seriously some complaints are downright stupid.  Nothing can save this movie now from being a box office disaster but Warner Brothers I doubt it is much consolation, I for one loved this movie and I will surely be picking it up on blu ray!",1362787200,3,938,4.367816091954023
4975149,3,B00683T5L8,"This film is just one of those films where you know it's not going to be great but its not going to be horrible either, thats what i thought when i went in to the theater to view this film. I had previously heard about the film being pushed back almost a full year from its June 2012 release date. But it didn't make me think twice about going and seeing it. What i saw did not impress me a all, considering all the time the film had to be made perfect. This film had major issues and major successes thats why its 3 stars instead of 2 and a half which i was originally planning on giving this film. Ok now to start actually reviewing this film. The first things are the good things and they are the acting, cast, characters, comedy, story, and suspence. Ok to start with the acting. The acting in this film from the trailer seems cheesy and fake, but its not it is actually good. The best of the lot are Nicholas Hoult, Stanley Tucci (as always),and surprisingly Ian McShane. Nicholas Houltis on the verge of star status , for me that is, because it seems like this film is going to bomb at the box office. But never the less, he seems to always dig deep into his characters as shown in his performance as R, a zombie with a heart in Warm Bodies. This timehe digs deep to find his brave, farm boy self inside. He does well, he isjust one of those actors who actually can act well. And making it seem like its not acting , that it actually is a person, or monster. And Stanley Tucci, heck who does not always enjoy his fun performances!? I mean i gave him praise for his stand out performance in The Hunger Games, and The Devel Wears Prada. He just makes me laugh all the time he makes me like him, and hate him, depending on his roles. He can get me to feel him. Now for the last one Ian McShane does well surprisingly as the brave king, who instead ofbeing cowardly and hiding in the castle stands out to fight. He is wonderfully cast and acted in the film. And as for Ewan McGregor and Eleanor Tomlinson well they didn't stick out. Their actring was normal, same old , same old. It was not special nor horrible either. Now ontop the cast. This film as i said before has an excellent cast, of mostly unknowns. The Highlights are Bill Nighy as the voice of the lead giant, Fallon. He puts great effort into his characters and succeeds in becoming a tough leader like voice fore a giant. He was well chosen for the part. And Ewan McGregor and Nicholas Hoult were also well cast in their parts. Even though Ewan McGregor's acting was not anything special he is still the only one i can see playiong his part actually. And Nicholas Hoult, well he is epic, in the part of Jack. He is a genuine, brillent casting. I can think of knowone that could play Jack as good as he could. Now onto the characters. The characters are very good. Though few in characters i, tend to like some of the characters and would hate to see them die referring to Jack, and Elmont. Now not all of the characters are develpt that great, but i'll get onto it later on in this review. The jokes are really good, they are very funny (while childish i may add) these jokes are just super goofy and perfect for this film. The stroy is really interesting and original. I never thought about Jack ever slaying giants or them com ing down here to eat people, or a crown controlling them. They brought interesting ideas into this film. The suspence in this film is high. I was on the edge of my seat as the bean stalk fell, and when Isabelle almost got slabbed in the head. I was like OMG, it was really crazy, and when the first giant appeared and the water started moving it kinda gave a Jurassic Park vibe to it. Now with every good thing comes a bad thing and this film has a few which include the screen- play, ending, animation, lodgic, PG-13 rating, and running time. Ok so the screen -play as i previously stated is pretty much a weak script. I mean you have like the bald guy come over, look down and say ""where , where"" i'm like wtf, and then he gets pushed over the cliff and killed. Wow. That is not good. The script is just way weak, and it effected the poor ending. There is not alot of giants, which caused me to turn on the running time as an issue. It also effects the character develpment of the supporting characters like Ewen Bremner as Wicke, Ralph Brown as General Entin, and Eddie Marsan as Crawe. Those characters are given very little develpment and are killed off like nothing. Come on whats with that i mean i know nothing about them and feel nothing for them when they finally meet their poor deaths. The screen-play includes mostly poor writing, with a couple cheesy lines thrown in for effect. The endingin this film is horrible. The whole film leads up to whats surrposed to be an epic battle between giants and man kind, but all we get is a couple tree throwings and thats it before they are all heading back to the sky? What the heck , it is a big disappointment to me. trhe film ends with no battle or anything. The whole film leads up to something but fails to deliver anything at the end. The trailers promise a epic ending but the actual film gives us non of the above. The animation is um, not great but not horrible. There was not alot of differences between all of the giants except for Fumm, Fallon, and the giant with its hair standing up, all the others are just bald and tall, they just didn't spend much time to different one giant from another. The animation also to me looked way to cartoonish and not very relistic, they just used way to much animation on their giants, way to much, it was overloaded. This film is anything but logical. I mean when the humans and giants are playing tug a war the humans almost won. And it went on for nearly 10 minutes. I mean two think that these huge big giants can't take on the ant sized weak humans is crazy. That part really upset me. This film seems way to tame for a PG- 13 film. I mean they could have shown the people being eaten like Ewen Bremner's character, and shown alittle blood coming out, they didn't half to show tons but you know atleast show it. Don't have all the eatings happen off screen or so fast that we don't catch it. It makes me wonder what happenes to those characters. Wow PG- 13 ratings have become really strict. Almost all films now get R ratings. The running time is way to small for this film. It should have been around 2 and a half, 3 hours, people could make it i know it. The script could have added more giants, and a long battle sequence, and more character develpment. And youknow more small scenes like exploring the jungle in the giants world more and finding giant monsters , some fun if you will. All and All this film had its highs and lows. It was really difficult to come up with a proper rating too. And finally alittle more praise on the wonderful, Nicholas Hoult, who was the star of the show. C+",1362787200,3,6896,4.272935779816514

I thought that the giant army would battle the human army now does this happen my answer would be both yes and no (i will let the person watching the film decide for themsevles) i guess my problem was i had high expections for this movie and it fell short of what i wanted to see but still check it out its a great movie in its own right and its still very entertaining just don't have high hopes for anything super super epic. is it epic again i answer both yes and no but again its still worth watching,1362441600,,869,4.2727272727272725
