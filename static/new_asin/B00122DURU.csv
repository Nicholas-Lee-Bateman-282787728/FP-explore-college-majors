It's not an entirely original story, but it's different enough to be interesting. what drives this anime is the strong bonds that the characters form with one another. The main character, Jin, and his girlfriend, Toa, are really cool characters. You really want them to find happiness. The animation in this series is impressive. There are lots of bright colors. It kind of has the Heroic Age vibe to it. If you have seen Heroic Age and liked it you will certainly like Dragonaut. If you haven't I recommend Dragonaut to any anime fan. It's well worth the reasonable price.",1354665600,,682,4.739495798319328
8243600,5,B00122DURU,"OK people this is my humble opinion about this anime (although again I ended up reviewing an anime that has not reached the US market yet - an assumption based on where I live):

The story outline (without getting to much into the details so as to avoid giving spoilers away):
In the near future a planet called Tartarus gets in the orbit of Pluto and blasts is away. So what you may say. Well, to make the long story short Earth is threatened by this planet of not only colliding with it but also of being invaded by its inhabitants who can take on human forms (with super abilities) or transform into dragons. So as for earth to counter this threat they have created the dragons of earth who can be piloted by humans ones they have been resonated by them (these are called dragonauts) and are supposed to be loyal to their human-masters.
The main protagonist survived a shuttle crash that was caused by colliding with one of the extraterrestrial beings. And he is protected by one of the three original extraterrestrial beings that came to earth and both of them fall in love with each other.

So what, again, you may say (a question that is justified). Well, what makes this anime worth watching are besides the action, the story that evolves, the romance that exists (basically a love triangle is formed) plus the funny, sometimes, and on other moments the emotional moments of the series.
On top of that, power games will occur among various groups, betrayals among friends, twists etc.

Animation:
The animation is very good

Acting:
The acting of the series is very well and professional executed (as for dubs I don't know cause I saw the original version in Japanese, sorry for that)

Music:
The music that accompanies the series is perfectly orchestrated and has a very touching ending song (and guess what kind of song that is: and you are correct, a ballad).

Buying or not:
The answer would be yes But the prices that I see here they are momentarily way to expensive (maybe wait a little bit till they go down).

I hope that I could help you...",1225929600,,2056,4.570652173913044
