8229857,1,B000XULOC0,"This is one of the worst action DVD from Amazon.com I have even seen (Usually, I enjoy it). It is chaotic and there seems to be no coherent continuity between one episode to another. This is not to say that the fighting sequences are not good. With a modicum of editing, it can be made much better. In fact, if I have to evaluate the fighting sequences alone, I would have rated the DVD 5 star. This action DVD is salvagable, but, the editor is lazy.",1243728000,,450,4.244186046511628
8229858,5,B000XULOC0,Excellent movie!  If you're tired of the typical martial arts movie with no story lines then get this movie.  It's action packed and well acted.,1207353600,,144,4.72
