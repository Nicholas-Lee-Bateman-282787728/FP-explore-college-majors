3905530,2,B002CA68H0,"Comment: Sorry... this is one of those movies that I describe as a bunch of actors got tired of acting indoors, so went outdoors and turned an indoor play into an outdoor ""goofy and sappy"" farce. Very very loosely based on facts that few people are familiar with... it just turns stupid. Pass on this one.",1300320000,,305,4.464285714285714
3905531,4,B002CA68H0,"Fun, funny and set in Dublin, Ireland.

Typical happy ending, yes, but, one of a kind Irish style, crack you up craic of a story.

Thumbs up with a wee smile for sure.

""Waiting For Dublin"" is a modest, unassuming little charmer set in the peaceful Irish countryside just a few months prior to the end of World War II (Ireland being a ""neutral"" country in the conflict).  Mike (Andrew Keegan) is an American fighter pilot whose plane goes decidedly off course, stranding him and his British co-pilot, ""Twickers"" (Hugh O`Connor), in a village just chock full of lovable eccentrics and cranks, brimming over with thick brogues and quaint, old-fashioned country ways.  Mike is also one ""kill"" shy of the five he needs to officially become a flying ace and to win the $10,000 bet he inadvertently made with Al Capone's nephew back in the States right before heading off to war.  The opportunity for achieving that goal comes in the form of a German flyer who finds himself stuck in the same town.  Now all Mike has to do is to somehow convince the affable chap to let him shoot him out of the sky so the American can claim his fifth victim and win both his title and his wager.

With cleverness and wit and more than a touch of the customary blarney, ""Waiting For Dublin"" doesn't add up to very much in the end, but the truth is it really doesn't care that it doesn't - and, quite frankly, neither do we.  For its greatest charm lies in its not trying to be anything more than just a pleasantly innocuous, no-sweat-no-strain kind of offbeat diversion.  And at that it succeeds very well - even if it does go off the rails a bit towards the end.  Pleasant performances, lovely cinematography, and a fine sense of atmosphere are just icing on the cake.

It's not a movie you're likely to remember much about years after having seen it, but it makes for enjoyable enough viewing while you're at it.",1249344000,8,1730,4.56957928802589

8363797,5,B002CA68H0,"A classic British farce, with US airmen and a friendly German pilot stranded in an out of the way village in neutral Ireland during the end of World War II. With only days to go before the war is over, the American pilot struggles to get ""one more plane"" shot down so he can become an Ace, and collect a bet made the night before shipping overseas, with Al Capone's nephew.... a bet he has no way to pay if he doesn't come home an Ace.",1454544000,,435,4.069767441860465
