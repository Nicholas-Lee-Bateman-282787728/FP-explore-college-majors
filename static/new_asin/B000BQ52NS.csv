8090800,5,B000BQ52NS,This was a very interesting dvd. I really enjoyed the history of the horses but I wasn't expecting a view into the filming of this dvd. That was an added bonus.,1423008000,,160,4.193548387096774
8090801,5,B000BQ52NS,"The Spanish Riding School of Vienna is the last riding academy in the world where classical horsemanship is still cultivated in its purest form.  On this DVD, we watch the Lippizan stallions perform at their home in the Spanish Riding School of Vienna, and we also see them running free in the high mountain pastures of Austria.  There is a voice-over explaining the history of the Spanish Riding School, and the maneuvers performed by the flying white horses (and one bay), and also a musical accompaniment consisting of Spanish guitar music, trumpet flourishes, plus an assortment of Viennese waltzes and quadrilles.

Lippiza, the original home of the Lippizaner stud is now in Slovenia, and the brood mare band and young horses are now kept in Piber, Austria.

My husband and I were fortunate enough to attend a command performance that was given in honor of President Carter's state visit to Vienna in 1979 (the President didn't attend the performance, but Rosalynn and Amy Carter were ensconced under the portrait of Emperor Charles VI).  I had just started taking dressage lessons before our trip, and watching the perfect harmony, the unspoken communication between horse and rider was one of the most beautiful moments of my life.

In one of my favorite moments on this video, we see a Lippizan stallion in his loose box at the Piber stud farm.  His dark eyes are large and expressive, his nostrils flare in anticipation as a mare is being led to him, and he is performing a beautiful piaffe alone in his stall, out of sheer exuberance.

I don't think I've ever seen a more beautiful documentary, and I highly recommend this DVD to all horse lovers.",1393113600,3,1657,4.830388692579505

8090803,5,B000BQ52NS,"They show the riding school, and gorgeous heavenly horses to nice settings and great classical music.  If you collect information on them, you will have one of the best mood changing meditations.  I watched it on passport earth in that TV series on ch BYUTV it is somewhere around 30  minutes long I would say give a few minutes.  I saw them personally and may write a book on them, they glide and show horse dances also explaining the school.  I would also re-comment miracle of the white stallions.",1340236800,4,500,4.573033707865169
