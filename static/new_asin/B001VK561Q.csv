I loved it when I was a child when the movie was first shown.  I still love it as an adult.

3822604,5,B001VK561Q,This is a great movie for teachers teaching ASL.  It shows how the Deaf Community was treated after the Milan Conference in Italy in 1880.  That was the Start of Discrimination against ASL and the Deaf Community.,1392422400,,212,4.702702702702703

3822608,5,B001VK561Q,"This movie is an extremely important movie...important to the point that I believe it should be shown in schools.  Yes, getting a glimpse into the depression era is good, but on top of that we get to see a family that faces challenges in several different ways that may be new to us.  Mare is always excellent, and the rest of the cast were right up to par with her.  We see her dealing with being a hearing child/young adult/ wife and mother. The intensity of communicating adult matters to other adults and dealing with judgements made on her parents.  Introducing William into this paradigm that he will be joining and helping her maneuver.  The physical and emotional pain felt by her mother's co-worker, and the emotional reaction of the others, not completely understood by hearing onlookers, but understood in its entirety by the non-hearing.  Love is Never Silent should be on a required viewing/reading list along with The Miracle Worker and Children of a Lesser God!  <3",1385856000,,980,4.7976190476190474
3822609,4,B001VK561Q,Saw this film on TV years ago and could never find it until now.  This is a tremendous film that presents the struggles of the non-hearing in a hearing world.,1380672000,,158,4.266666666666667

3822612,5,B001VK561Q,Turn off the sound then allow ASL students to read the closed captioned and watch Deaf's signs.  Have the list of questions ready for students to answer.  Students enjoy learning to immerse in the Deaf community by watch this video.,1363478400,,232,4.775
3822613,5,B001VK561Q,"I was thrilled to find this on Amazon after a friend lost my original VHS from many years ago!  It is a very special, heartwarming, family-friendly movie (with one exception of one bedroom scene..it could  have been worse....perhaps not for the very young)  Would recommend to anyone!",1361059200,,284,5.0
3822614,5,B001VK561Q,This is a must to watch. I am deaf and this is a CC and has a lot of signing. This is about 2 deaf parents with children during the depression time. This shows where they can't sign in public and not sure if they were ashamed or it wasn't allowed in public so they live in shelter lives. I can relate to that.,1360108800,,309,3.84375
3822615,5,B001VK561Q,"This movie will make you laugh, cry, and understand the world of Deafness a little bit. It is an outstanding story, with outstanding acting, and an outstanding way to show the obstacles that some Deaf people face in a hearing world. This movie is absolutely WONDERFUL!",1356825600,,268,4.8478260869565215
3822616,5,B001VK561Q,A wonderful movie that gives insight to the deaf world. Powerful - get the tissues out! I will watch this over and over,1353456000,,119,4.217391304347826

3822618,5,B001VK561Q,"It's extremely rare for me to give a 5 on anything. But this movie, Love is Never Silent, is an excellent and captivating drama about Margaret's demanding struggles of love and shame with her Deaf parents in the 1930s and 40s. They've had a long road of cynicism until they found their independence.  The props and era setting are excellent. And a tearjerker from the beginning to the end.",1345939200,,389,4.63768115942029
3822619,5,B001VK561Q,"I must say, I have been looking for this movie and book for years.  Based on the novel ""In This Sign"", this film , to me, was landmark.  A brilliant performance by the incomparable Mare Winningham, this film says so much about what is right and what is wrong in growing up as a hearing child of deaf parents.  I am an English teacher and am looking into teaching this remarkable story to my students.  I saw it when I was fifteen and I'll never forget it.  Catch it now....briliant....",1336089600,,485,4.344444444444444
3822620,5,B001VK561Q,I am deaf and I love this movie. It is educational for hearing people to know what life was for deaf people. The movie portrays how deaf people were treated. In those days interpreters were unheard of. Their hearing daughter became their mouthpiece and it was hard for a child to assist her deaf parents I recommend this movie for those wh9o are studying deaf cultures or want to work wth the deaf.,1334275200,,398,4.465753424657534
3822621,1,B001VK561Q,"This movie portrays Deaf people as helpless and not capable. I understand the idea...but it is a movie full of depressing characters, with a choppy storyline, and...wow. I understand it was made 25 years ago but NOT a film I would recommend to anyone who actually wants to know anything about Deaf people or Deaf culture.

And...let's add insult to injury...the DVD SAYS it's captioned, but the captioning doesn't work. Deaf people can't even access this film that portrays them so poorly. :(

TERRIBLE film.",1331251200,5,508,4.964705882352941
3822622,5,B001VK561Q,As an interpreter for the deaf with ties to the deaf community I love this movie! It's my favorite movie EVER.,1328832000,,110,4.285714285714286

3822625,4,B001VK561Q,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I watched it with my mother.  She is deaf and I am hearing.  I could really relate to this movie because I grew up with deaf parents and had 4 older hearing siblings.  I thought this movie did a very good job of a CODA""s perspective of growing up with deaf parents.  However, it is much different today because the technology we have now gives the Deaf more opportunity to be independent and not rely on hearing people to speak for them.  I hope you enjoy it!!",1300060800,,490,4.271739130434782
3822626,4,B001VK561Q,"As a student of ASL, this was a excellent movie to do a paper on.  Many things going on.  Watch , look and listen, both with your eyes and ears you might miss something.",1292889600,,169,3.9411764705882355
3822627,5,B001VK561Q,Those who think that the Deaf need to just buck up and join the hearing culture need to see this film.  It is a heartwarming story about a woman caught between two distinct cultures and shows just how distinct they are.  I highly reccomend it for anyone who has an interest in the Deaf culture or any diverse cultures.,1288569600,,318,4.372881355932203
3822628,5,B001VK561Q,"This movie very realistically protrays the family life of a hearing child with two deaf parents, played by actors who are deaf.  It tugs at your heart and really opens your eyes to how difficult life can be for those who cannot hear.

Mare Winningham plays a girl who is the ears and voice for her family.  Her brother dying in an awful accident early on in her life leaves her as their only link to the hearing world.  When she comes of age, she must deal with the struggle to balance the responsibility she feels for her parents and the desires of her own heart.

I remembered this movie from 25 years ago and was thrilled to find a copy in DVD.  A family movie that can open up great conversation regarding those we view as handicapped and how we can understand their dilemmas and be open to making their lives a little easier.

Adults, teens, tweens ... a movie I recommend for all.",1280707200,4,886,4.333333333333333
3822629,5,B001VK561Q,"This is an excellent film which provides the viewer with an unique perspective of Deaf people and their culture during the years of the Great Depression (1930s).  This Hallmark film was also unique in having the key roles of Deaf individuals performed by prominent Deaf actors.  Those two actors, Phyllis Frelich and Edmund Waterstreet, gave performances which provided much insight into the challenges and difficulties that Deaf individuals had in dealing with hearing people in the world of work and outside during those hard times.

The previous reviewer of this DVD mentioned that it was not captioned.  I am assuming that he was referring to the lack of english subtitles.  If that is the case, he is correct.  However, this DVD fortunately is closed captioned.  If any viewers turn on the decoder in their television sets, the captioning should be viewable.  Both the film and the ""Making of"" featurette are closed captioned.

This DVD product is highly recommended for anyone with interest in learning about Deaf people.  This film is based on an excellent book which was published during the early 1970s called In This Sign by Joanne Greenberg.  I would recommend anyone who views this film to also read the book.",1279756800,18,1221,4.9950495049504955
3822630,3,B001VK561Q,"One of the best TV movies ever made?  Yes, I'd agree.
Perfect in every way? No way. Not one  of the dozen or so reviews mentioned the GLARING omission of any captioning.  This DVD is not pure shovelWARE; there's a ""Making of"" extra feature and some production notes so how on earth can Hallmake be so lame as to not provide for captioning???? Come on, this is a movie about the deaf community for Pete's sake!  The movie begins with a voice over and there are scenes where lip reading is not possible.  So what were they thinking?!  I'd give it a 5 star if it had captioning but its really annoying without it.
PS, I am hearing (not deaf).",1278633600,10,639,4.283333333333333
3822631,5,B001VK561Q,For anyone wanting to understand the deaf culture and the hearing culture worlds coming together. This one is it!,1275177600,,113,5.0
3822632,4,B001VK561Q,"I have been looking for this movie for years.  It's based on a book who's name escapes me (I believe it is titled, In This Sign).  What was fascinating about the book was that it was written by someone who did not grow up in the deaf community, yet she was able to capture it's essence and the basic distrust the deaf community, especially in the time it was set, has for hearing people.

The mother and father are played by two actors well known in the deaf community (Phyllis Frelich and Ed Waterstreet who are real life spouses.  I believe they founded Deaf West Theater in California).  Interestingly, Mare Winningham also played Helen Keller in another television production which was also excellent. Winningham does a decent job as the daughter, but I wish they had gotten someone with better fluency as she would have had if she were a child of deaf parents and had been their interpreter all her life (someone like Louise Fletcher who has deaf parents and was actually introduced to acting by an aunt who taught her to speak according to IMDB.  And, yes, hearing children of deaf parents may have some speech problems as they may not be hearing speech at home as very young children. That aspect is part of the storyline in the book if not the movie.  Although at 51 Louise would have been too old.  She was born in 1934). Lou Fant also appears as an interpreter when the mother character retires from her job.  He is a child of deaf parents and a well known teacher of sign language and story teller.

It's a story about a family with two hearing kids - a boy and a girl with two deaf parents and their trials and tribulations at the hands of hearing people and because of misunderstandings due to their inability to communicate with the hearing world and it's misperceptions of deaf people, but also deaf people's misperceptions of hearing people.  Although they are quite fluent in their communication with each other in their little family unit.  At one point, the little brother dies and the little girl has to act as interpreter for her parents as they make funeral arrangements.  She feels embarrassed and ashamed of them.  They make some attempt to appear more hearing-like (the dad briefly wears an old fashioned hearing aid, which provides no benefit. But he thinks it will please his daughter and only makes her feel more embarrassed and alienated from her classmates).  She is able to escape for brief moments when she befriends a neighborhood storekeeper who has a radio.

After many years of saving, they are able to move out of their poor apartment and move into a little house.  The daughter meets a serviceman and brings him home to dinner.  Cloris Leachman plays his mother and adequately shows the discomfort hearing people have when they are around deaf people do not know sign and don't know how to communicate with them.  There is awkwardness as the parents must entertain these strangers and the daughter straddles the hearing world and the deaf world. There is a tender scene when she confronts the parents about what life has been like for her and how she felt about having to act as interpreter and adult because everyone treats her parents as though they are the children and she is the adult as they must communicate to them through her.

I may have mixed some of the storyline with the book, but they are good read and a good watch.  Although the book and the movie are somewhat romanticized versions of what hearing people think it is to be deaf in a hearing world.  The couple is portrayed as being confused on many accounts and perhaps that may have been true in those earlier part of the last century.",1272412800,,3642,4.613953488372093

3822637,5,B001VK561Q,"I've been waiting a long time to purchase 'Love is Never Silent' on dvd. I remember seeing it on TV in December 1986.

In the tradition of 'It's a Wonderful Life', 'Love is Never Silent' is a very cumulative movie in which it prepares the viewer for the emotional scene near the end of the film. It's certainly one of the most gut wrenching scenes I've ever seen on TV.

Mare Winningham is second to none in her role as Margaret. Since her parents cannot hear, Margaret is their 'bridge' to the hearing world. Ed Waterstreet and Phyllis Frelich are quite convincing as the manipulative, deaf parents. Sid Ceasar is perfect as the kindly neighbor and friend. Cloris Leachman makes a rare departure from comedy, and clearly demonstrates her tremendous skills in drama.

I highly recommend this excellent movie. Mare Winningham learned sign language for the role (which is an impressive accomplishment).",1250121600,5,900,4.907894736842105

8346528,5,B001VK561Q,"This is a classic movie that does not pull any punches.  In a very short 92 minutes, the viewer is transported back to the days around WWII.  Our lead actress tells her story of being born a hearing daughter of two Deaf parents.  We are shown the small depression-era apartment the family lives in, the mother and father are hard at work, and we begin to gain insight on the prejudice and gross unfairness that surrounded them.  The parents have developed a guarded stance, if not an outright distrust of the hearing borne of so many experiences where trust was used against them.  And then there is communication - the life trial of every Deaf person who tries to interact with the hearing world.  The daughter has lived the fate of so many hearing Children of Deaf Adults (CODAs):  She has become their voice, their eyes, their bridge between the worlds of hearing and Deaf.  This is brought painfully home in one of the first scenes.  While I do not want to post a spoiler in a review, I will say that in showing us the scene of a then ten-year old child having to interpret for her parents in a situation no child should have to face, Hallmark and the playwrights have shown us clearly an unvarnished view of life of a CODA - a situation that still goes on today, maybe not to that extreme, but each person has their own burden.  The best aspect of the film for me is that the roles of people who are Deaf are played by people who are/were Deaf in actual life, not a hearing actor portraying deafness.  This gives the viewer a very real aspect as the actors and actresses are telling their story from the heart.  They have lived through stories like this personally.  It is not just a story for them.  It is their story.  Younger viewers may not remember the gifted Phyllis Frelich, who played the mother, but this movie is my favorite of all the roles I have seen her play.  I would recommend this movie to anyone from junior high school age up.  There are one or two scenes that would be difficult for a child to watch, indeed, they are hard for an adult to witness, but they need to be shared, and are vital to the total story that needs to be told.  Once you have seen this film, you will find that love does not need spoken words, only an open heart, because Love IS Never Silent.",1477872000,3,2289,4.345882352941176
