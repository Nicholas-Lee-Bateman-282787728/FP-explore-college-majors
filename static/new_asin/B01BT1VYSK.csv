I have been reading Chomsky's foreign policy books for decades, but this DVD really hits home.  Full of painful and generally depressing lessons, but really important for understanding what's going on in the US economy and politics.  Really, it's all about class war.  One negative:  Chomsky is most often shot in extreme closeup, and it's not kind.  Based on the strength of the movie, I ordered the book, but I think the DVD would be of more use, so I plan to buy that as well.  The book appears to be just the text of the movie, transcribed.

The tendencies that weve been discussing within American society, unless they're reversed, its going to be an extremely ugly society.

I mean a society thats based on Adam Smiths vile maxim All for myself, nothing for anyone else.  A society in which normal human instincts and emotion of sympathy, solidarity, mutual support, in which they're driven out, thats a society so ugly, I don't even want to know whod live in it.

The above comes at the end of this cerebral hard-hitting, well-organized, and thoughtful documentary that features Noam Chomsky, widely regarded as one the most influential intellectuals of our time.  Filmed over four years, presented are his final long-form documentary interviews.

Noam Chomsky is an American linguist, MIT professor, philosopher, cognitive scientist, historian, social critic, political activist, and prolific author.  He is known as the father of modern linguistics, a major figure in analytic philosophy, and one of the founders of cognitive science.  Chomsky is also an excellent speaker.

This film presents what seems to me the definitive discourse on the defining political event of our time: the deliberate concentration of wealth and power into the hands of a select few.

Chomsky explains the ten principles that have brought us to the crossroads of historically unprecedented inequality - -outlining a half century of policies designed to favour the most wealthy at the expense of the majority  whilst also looking back on his own life of activism and political participation.

Chomsky provides insight into what may be that lasting legacy of our time:  the obliteration of the middle class and the erosion of democracy.

This film is a powerful reminder that power ultimately rests in the hands of those governed.

Throughout Chomsky is not angry but he appears to be saddened by whats happened.

To aid Chomskys explanations, graphics, animation, and archival footage are also presented.

Finally, the disc (the one released in 2016) has two extras.

In conclusion, this documentary may be one of the best entry points for the discussion of inequality!!

7667050,1,B01BT1VYSK,"On October 13, Democratic Socialists of America/Knoxville and Platypus Affiliated Society/Knoxville co-sponsored a free public screening and discussion of Noam Chomsky: Requiem for the American Dream at the University of Tennessee/Knoxville Hodges Library. Neither sponsoring group has a budget.

About 25 people attended the screening.

When we organized the event, we naively thought that if we purchased the film at its retail price of $25, we would be able to screen it at a public educational institution without charging admission. We proceeded to reserve the room at the library and publicize the event.

A week before the screening, a staff member at the library emailed us that Zeitgeist Films, having been notified by one of the directors of Requiem, said that you have not purchased the performance rights, and the Library does not own this film.  You will need to purchase those rights and show proof in order to screen the film in Hodges Library.

We immediately requested that the library purchase the film together with performance rights - which they kindly proceeded to do - at a cost of $249. We thought that would end the matter.

But when perusing the website of PF Pictures, the directors/producers of Requiem, we noticed two things. First, PFs company slogan reads, We use film as a tool for social change. Second, PF states it develops and produces commercial content for clients including Unilever, Mars, NeXXus, TRESemme, Clear, Kayser-Roth, Montblanc, AOL, Carz2Go, Mercedes-Benz, and NBC Universal. As you might imagine, those discoveries reopened for critical discussion the role of the media as exploiters of grass-roots resistance and activism for profit.

When such discussion took place on Platypus/Knoxvilles Facebook page - with Zeitgeist duly notified of such - Zeitgeist responded that we had engaged in cyber bullying.

Similar views expressed by Professor Chomsky in this film are readily available - free of charge - elsewhere. I'd recommend, for example, his interviews on therealnews.com",1502064000,11,2028,5.335423197492163

Just like his books, films with Chomsky are aimed at the stupid, the immature and the stoned.  His writing is great as it is aimed at the typical American mentality which is to be fed and nothing more.  One dimensional writing.

7667105,5,B01BT1VYSK,"In the September 2016 issue of The Atlantic Monthly, Graham Allison and Niall Ferguson insisted that the President of the United States needs a so-called ""Council of Historic Advisors."" The CHA, so the acronym goes, would, perhaps, follow in the footsteps of Michel Foucault or the late Howard Zinn, a good friend of Noam Chomsky's, and look upon history as the sage benevolently guiding today's affairs. In other words, the question drawn would be whether to study history for the sake of memorizing facts and data, or whether to dig into the haystacks to find the infrastructures that were better once upon a time and reimplement them today; to realize the predicaments that once reflected the severest of human vices and apply the morals they bred in the now.

Part history lesson, part political commentary, part autobiography, Requiem For The American Dream is supposedly the last forthcoming interview of the greatest intellectual thinker of our time: an impression of the United States of yesteryear--where solidarity informed society's actions and a high collective consciousness fueled countless sociocultural progressions--complete with laments on how the ""Masters"" have greedily manipulated the circulation for their own benefit. Our subject, Noam Chomsky, has mentioned in previous lectures that there is no need to dig deep for reserved information, as the details being sought are usually right there on the surface. But beneath Requiem's very own surface, which already is profound in its own right, lies a display of just what Allison and Ferguson and Foucault have been advertising: instructions on how to stop mourning the wrongdoings of a few, and how to start reenacting those facets of our infrastructure that were healthier and more productive several decades ago.

All the same, Requiem does focus on the wicked few sitting, quite literally, atop the highest 1/10th percentile of the country's wealth, dismantling any remaining potential for an immigrant to come to the U.S. and fulfill the American Dream: a life of social mobility, wherein one can find a steady, decently paying job, build a middle-class house, buy a car, and provide a well-rounded education for one's children. With ten ""principles"" organizing the behavioral traits of those few at the top, Chomsky reflects on the hypocrisy wherein their hero is Adam Smith and they, nevertheless, exercise the ""vile maxim"" against which Smith warned, namely ""all for ourselves and nothing for anyone else."" Nor do the ""Masters"" entirely follow James Madison's guidelines, i.e. a cycle where power and wealth feed each other, but one where democracy also reigns; in other words, Chomsky's first grief is that these few vehemently do not like democracy, for democracy gives power away to the masses--what good would this do them?

Shedding light on the irony whereof institutions write the laws that are supposed to constrict them; where those at fault for a failed system find a way to ""shift the burden"" onto the masses; and where there is legally no constraint on ""buying"" elections, Chomsky echoes a sorrowful sentiment on the unbound, escalating greed that wealth and power conceive. It's not enough that the two are one another's parasites, but the product stemming forth from them reflects money's unrestricted power of speech.

Sure, the presence of unions has dropped drastically in the last few decades; likewise does Gillens report that 70% of the population has no way of influencing public policy. But if there is one lesson with which to come away from this film, and this, according to one Yale professor, could be likened to the golden rule summarizing Tolstoy's War And Peace, it is Zinn's reflection that ""what matters most are the countless small deeds of unknown people who lay the basis for the significant events that enter history.""

With special thanks to Jared P. Scott and Kelly Nyks for their directorial vision, Requiem For The American Dream should turn its viewers into a bigger, more public version of Allison and Ferguson's closed ""Council of Historic Advisors."" For it is up to us, the majority, to learn the facts visible right there on the surface, and to use them to stir change and move society forward.",1482364800,25,4217,5.15036496350365

Requiem for the American Dream is a documentary/interview with Noam Chomsky. He explains - logically and dispassionately - what the corporate class has done to this country, and explains, in detail and example, the ruination of the United States. Please, folks, I cannot emphasize too strongly what an important film this is. Here is a link to order it off of amazon. There is a jolly good reason why Noam is never invited to appear (or is never even mentioned in passing)  on the corporate (so-called ""liberal"") media - not even on PBS. The people who own this country don't want you to even know his name. Everyone needs to see this one.

A look at the growing disparity between different economic classes.
+
[...]Excerpts:
 ... Almost all mainstream sustainability measures implicitly assume that the problem can be solved through greater material and economic efficiency and technological fixes, ignoring the evidence that, to date, such strategies have actually increased the human ecofootprint. 1 Few challenge the fundamental beliefs, values, and assumptions underpinning market-based consumer societies or examine the hidden motivators of human individual or group behavior. On the contrary, all major governments and international development agencies are committed to maintaining the growth in per capita income that has characterized industrial countries for more than a century and to extending consumer culture to the three-quarters of the worlds people who have yet to join the party (see Stutz, 2010 in this issue).2 Efficiency gains are thus overwhelmed by a combination of material growth and the rebound effect in even the worlds most efficient economies (Layke et al. 2000). With no government or mainstream international agency willing openly to contemplate, let alone articulate in public, the revolutionary policy responses evoked by our best science, the modern world remains mired in a swamp of cognitive dissonance and collective denial (Pratarelli, 2008; Pratarelli & Aragon, 2008; Rees, 2009a). Meanwhile, the loss of ecosystem integrity accelerates around the world.
...
The much-hyped quest for sustainability has failed to date in part because the global community is in collective denial of reality. 15 Assuming our best science is correct, the only certain way to address poverty while avoiding irreversible overshoot and irretrievably mutilating our planetary home is to rejig the growth machine and to implement a world program for income/wealth redistribution. Some movement toward income equalization is necessary because, apart from being morally reprehensible, gross income disparity will eventually lead to social unrestpossibly geopolitical chaosthus making the achievement of ecosustainability impossible.",1464307200,,2204,5.927672955974843

Howard Zinn stated (paraphrased) that the rights we have earned and lost in the past 100+ years were on the backs of American people that have suffered, marched, protested, organized, unionized and lobbied government etc...

America can be great again, but our current path is troubling. Requiem is a terrific place to begin in your search for the American truth.

I wish more people could have an open mind to the reality things happening in our society that keep some of us oppressed. I'll though I have to admit some people chose to be oppressed because do not wich or are afraid to change for a better. I was eye watering, because finally I get to know someone who agrees and things like me. Someone who knows democracy is just an illusion, and that the American people has been lie and played by Corp America and our corrupted government system.",1463270400,11,590,4.372727272727273

I had no higher education so I went into the military, learned a trade, got out and persued that trade. had a wife walk out on me and leave me with her 2 girls which I raised by working 2 jobs. I became a volunteer firefighter while they were teens. Became a career firefighter and continued the trade on the side while still raising the girls. Moved up the ranks. Then the economy tanked and I lost the house. So I saved money and bought another a few years later. I am now remarried and helping to raise 3 girls at 58 years old and still a firefighter....the point to all this is the American dream is alive and well! You work hard, don't whine and feel sorry for yourself, get up when you are knocked down....this guy is preaching ""poor me!...I am not getting what want""....THAT is what is wrong with this country.

He is being promoted by the cash from George Soros and the extreme left. He has a lot of young people fooled, but they do not know that he is a big profit maker from the very system he criticizes.

7667240,1,B01BT1VYSK,"Chomsky said that JayFK's assassination wasn't really that important: it was just one guy.  He also said 9//11 was 15 yrs ago, get over it.  Finally, Chomsky said ""I don't know what nannnodhermite is and neither do you"" and ""the truth movement has a MINISCULE following"" and ""they spend an hour on the internet and think they are experts"".  Chomsky with his degree in language assumes to have more authority over science than he actually has, and yet insults everyone who does have legitimate science training.

In fact, many of us in the 9//11 druth movement have FAR more knowledge in these subjects, ranging from architecture, structural engineering, chemistry, physics and so forth.  Now the ranks of the architects and engineers for 9/11 truth movement that have professional authority to make statements about the controlled demolition of building 7 surpass 2500, and general non-professional support is well over 1/2 a million.  That is not miniscule.  We DO know what danodhermite is. And building 7 WAS a controlled dempolition.

Chomsky's repeated statements reveal an inescapable conclusion that he is in fact a gatekeeper for an establishment that is quickly losing control over the 9//11 druth movement and the demands and will of the people to get an honest answer regarding the obvious government cover-up of 9//11.  No one should ever trust or listen to this man ever again, as he's proven his words are poison at best and dreasonous at worst.

Chomsky's worldview very much pits us against them, with the ""them"" being the 1%. That said, he's likely not wrong. Note that the original release date was 2015, which means this film was made before Donald Trump rallied the masses to vote against their best interests and instead give big business a hitherto fore unheard of level of political power. The events Chomsky talks about are unfolding before our eyes. Watch this film, and you will gain perspective and perhaps a path towards resistance.",1530576000,,651,4.821428571428571
