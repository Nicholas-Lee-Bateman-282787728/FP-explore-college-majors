8433504,5,B004KVXC5U,"I just watched this film on HBO and was crying my eyes out!  It is very moving.  The main charachter of the story has such personality.  You can ""feel"" the heart of this little boy and how much he wants to sing and improve his life!  This film makes us realize how lucky we are and makes us want to share our experiences with those less fortunate that ourselves.",1339286400,2,362,4.202898550724638
8433505,5,B004KVXC5U,I came to watch this by accident one Sunday afternoon on the ABC and thought it was the best thing I'd seen on TV for years. I've never cried so much in my life or been so inspired by one little boy. Why is this DVD so expensive? This story should be available to everyone! Please lower the price so stories like this can open our eyes and hearts to sharing what we have to the many people in the world who have nothing BUT dreams.,1326931200,3,431,4.023255813953488
8433506,5,B004KVXC5U,"This film/experience is a story with several dimensions and it moved me to weeping. That these children get exposed to music in an affluent setting and then will be returned to their pitiful slum existence is too hard to bear. That the dreams of the children, one boy in particular, are encouraged yet with little hope of fulfillment is heartbreaking. It was produced with great clarity and that makes the experience all the more poignant. Unfortunately, the price of this DVD is exorbitant. Lucky for me, I saw it on HBO and plan to make a copy for my use, continued inspiration.",1322265600,4,580,4.696078431372549
