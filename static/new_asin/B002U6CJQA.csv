3988459,5,B002U6CJQA,"Dollar for dollar, this is the best MMA dvd you can get. It's loaded. It's a must have if you are a UFC and MMA fan. 12 bucks is nothing for it.",1335225600,,144,3.53125
3988460,4,B002U6CJQA,"Actually, you have two more choices. You can buy this DVD of ""moments"" from the 100 Greatest Fights for $5 or you can spend 5-6x that and buy the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UFC-Ultimate-100-Greatest-Fights/dp/B003XMKN7W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UFC: Ultimate 100 Greatest Fights</a>&nbsp;box set which shows all 100 fights in their entirety. That set runs over 26hrs whereas this DVD clocks in at just under 3.5hrs. If you're just a casual fan who's curious as to which fights they picked, you won't be disappointed with this DVD. It packs a lot of punch for such a cheap price. But if you want to see all 100 fights go the distance, you're gonna wanna go with the box. It all comes down to how much time and money you want to invest in some of the best the UFC has to offer.

Here's my personal ""Tale Of The Tape"" as to how these two match up: This ""moments"" DVD, unlike the box set, actually features on-camera commentary from more than half of the fighters on the countdown. They share their training regiment, fight strategy, injuries - both sustained and inflicted -, what they really think about their opponents, reactions to the judge's decisions, their personal picks for the greatest fight of all time and all kinds of other interesting trivia. For instance, I never knew that the Huerta/Garcia fight landed the UFC on the cover of Sports Illustrated. So even if you buy the box set, this DVD might make a nice companion piece if you want to learn more about the fighters or the fights. The only problem, and it's a big one, is that you can't directly access individual fights. This program was taken from a five night event that SpikeTV aired to coincide with UFC 100. In total there were five 50min. episodes. So you can only pick Episodes 1-5. For those who want to watch specific fights, you're going to be doing a lot of fast-forwarding. It's kind of a big hassle. But other than that, I still highly recommend this DVD. You're gaining some and losing some compared to the box set but you're saving a hell of a lot of money in the process. Truth be told, if I had found this DVD before I bought the box set, I probably wouldn't have spent the money on the box.",1332979200,10,2224,4.746770025839793
3988461,5,B002U6CJQA,"Ok so I bought this for my girlfriend and not for myself.  Go figure, she's the big MMA fan.  But she loves it and is still not done with it because she wants to treasure it as it counts down through the fights.

She loves the reviews and coverage, and it's a very nice, long DVD - not a quick one at all.

3988462,5,B002U6CJQA,"It's fair to say that back at UFC 1 in 1993 not many people thought that 16 years later UFC would be getting ready for its 100th event and would be easily doing over a million pay per view buys in the U.S alone and have a worldwide audience and would even be now accepted as a mainstream sport and be sanctioned in most U.S states, and sell out arenas in those that it is sanctioned. So what better way to celebrate the historic event UFC 100 would go on and become is to count down the top 100 moments in it's history.

It's fair to say two things saved UFC, first was the Fertitta brothers listening to Dana White and buying the company that was on it's last legs and the second was the self financed make or break reality show The Ultimate Fighter(TUF) becoming an overnight sensation on cable tv mainly thanks to the finale featuring finalists Stephan Bonnar and Forrest Griffin.

So what you get with this dvd is over 3 hours of a countdown(from 100 to 1) of the UFC's greatest moments, whether it be Ken Shamrock's and Tito Ortiz's heated rivalry, Matt Hughes coming back from an illegal groin strike or Randy Couture defying the critics and father time to become a champion at the age of 43 they are all include here, all the great fights and upsets!! I don't want to give away too much as that would spoil the countdown but there's many jump out of your seat moments and it's a great dvd for new fans of the sport to learn a bit of history.

There's loads of talking heads to talk about the moments including UFC president Dana White as well as commentator Joe Rogan and of course loads of the actual fighters that actually competed in the fights.

This dvd is really a must for new and old fans of the UFC and it must hurt the knockers of the sport who said it would never last and was too barbaric. One thing is for sure is that it won't take another 16 years before UFC 200 comes along!!",1299369600,3,1898,4.263888888888889
3988463,5,B002U6CJQA,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend.  It came just as described.  Brand new, still wrapped up in plastic.  It shipped within a day or two of ordering it.  Very satisfied.",1299024000,,175,4.212121212121212
3988464,4,B002U6CJQA,"Mike Goldberg runs through the top 100 fights as voted by the fans. Fight clips are interspersed with commentary from the fighters and other UFC names. Note that you do not get the full-length fights.

Also note that there is no DVD menu shortcut that takes you to the fight you want. The 100 fights are broken down into five episodes with the last episode being the top 10 fights. Neither does the DVD come with a booklet, so there is no quick way to locate particular fights to watch.

Spoiler: The #1 fight is... (see below)

...Griffin vs Bonnar (from the Ultimate Fighter season 1 finale)",1287014400,2,593,4.5233644859813085
3988465,4,B002U6CJQA,"Highlights! For anyone who is intending to by this item should know that it's a highlight DVD of 100 fights in UFC. It's a cool DVD to have when you don't have time to watch actual full fights. I think it's good to see short highlights of memorable moments of past UFC matches and having fighters talk about what happened in those fights; but don't expect to see all the fights you like. For example, I would of hoped to see some Bas Rutten, Marco Ruas, and even Frank Shamrock in this DVD. All in all I would say it's a nice DVD to have. I have watched it a few times now and am still watching it.. just to get that rush now and again.",1270771200,9,636,4.055555555555555
3988466,4,B002U6CJQA,"Nice for the UFC fans. I enjoyed it, but for the ones who have bought The Ultimate 100 Fights, it does not bring anything exciting. It could be much better if it had more interviews with the fighters. But, its a good buy for the fans.",1268265600,,234,4.108695652173913

3988488,2,B002U6CJQA,"May I say this review is not about the dvd but the way it was shipped. It was packed in a box with another (much Heavier) gift I had ordered which had squished the case which tore the cover art in three places. Also the dvd had been knocked loose from the case causing it to slide around resulting in scratches (though it still plays), meaning I had to open it just to stop the dvd from further damage. The person the gift was intended for had a small time frame to be home for the holidays so I had to present the gift as it was and explain the damages.",1387065600,,554,4.0

3988490,5,B002U6CJQA,"As the name of this DVD says, it's about moments, not about full fights at all. So that should be clear from the get-go, since I have read reviews of people complaining that this disc doesn't contain fights in their entirety. You are getting highlights of 100 of the greatest fights, with some extras like the fighters talking about their fights, what was going through their minds, training regime, commentators coments, and tidbits of info, to add to what made these 100 moments so great in the history of the UFC. If you are an MMA fan, and if you like the UFC, this is a great disc to own. It's just about 3 hours long, so for highlighting 100 moments I think it's great time. I see people complain ""it's too short"" or ""it's too long"". Come on people, it's just a matter of reading how long it is, and deciding if you (or whoever you will give it to) have the time to watch it, it's not that hard really... It may have all the moments you liked, it may be lacking a few we wish were in there, but all in all, it is a well made video. So sit back, and enjoy 100 good moments in the history of the Ultimate Fighting Championship.",1378944000,2,1131,4.216589861751152
3988491,3,B002U6CJQA,"OK... First off I love the UFC but this DVD was one of the worst they have put out. I wouldn't say it is the absolute worst they have put out but to me this was a waste of time and money. This dvd is clips of what UFC calls their 100 greatest fights. What UFC did was they had a poll on their website and the fans voted on the fights but the bad thing was that UFC left a lot of really great fights off the list because some of the fighters are or were on bad terms with Dana White. These fighters are guys like Ken Shamrock, Frank Shamrock, Tim Sylvia, Tito Ortiz, etc... Like I said, it is a waste of time and money when you can buy a set of all 100 fights in their complete form for about fifteen dollars more.",1375315200,,713,3.857142857142857
