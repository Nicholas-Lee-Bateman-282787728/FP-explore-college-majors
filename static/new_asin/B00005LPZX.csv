1623263,4,B00005LPZX,After Dolph hit a ultimate low with Agent Red it seemed like Dolph was washed up. Well The Last Warrior might be less action packed but the film remains a fun one from start to finish. The acting and directing is done in a straight foward meaning if Your a Dolph fan this is what the four star rating is for. Others I would rate a 3 star.,1004918400,,338,3.985294117647059
1623274,4,B00005LPZX,"I'm watching this and enjoying it and then I think, ""This would have made an awesome series"".  To me it seems like a series pitch that didn't get picked up so they released it as a DVD movie.  It's a little hokey and that made me think of a Sci-Fi channel show but I would have watched it anyway because I like the concept and Dolph is in it.",1323907200,,342,3.9420289855072466

1623276,1,B00005LPZX,"Dolph is one of the best when it comes to action movies; however, not this one.

This has to be the worst movie I've ever seen, EVER! I've seen quite a few badly produced films in my day with lame acting; however, this puppy takes the cake!

I don't know what the producers were smoking when they made this; however, the plot is a disaster. I can tell that the world has supposedly ended; however, there's nothing that really clarifies who all is alive across the globe and what they intend to do to survive. Overall, its a very depressing, non-action packed, vague, and a very strange movie.

To make matters worse they have a disease that people apparently can contract by drinking goat milk? - WTH? :D The disease causes disgusting pulsating soars on the skin - completely random. Further, there is some Voodoo woman who can cause the sky to rain because apparently the Earth no longer receives rain. She is wandering the plains with a school bus of kids for some reason and Dolph has fallen for her. WEIRD!!!

No one in the movie tries to figure out just what the hell happened to earth and what they intend to do about it. Most of the movie evolves around a military base with a bunch of drama queens who can barely even fire a weapon.

Please do not waste your time with this one! It is a disaster from start to finish.",1283299200,,1325,4.391836734693878

1623278,2,B00005LPZX,"I've seen several of Doplh Lundgren's films. SHOWDOWN IN LITTLE TOKYO had to have been one of his best, and he excelled as the cop who I nicknamed ""SGT. SAMURAI"". I also liked some of his other films like SWEEPERS, and Lundgren made a great bad guy in UNIVERSAL SOLDIER.
These days, he's suffered the fate of so many karate stars out there to be condemned to only direct-to-video films. He may never be in another theatrical fim again, but that doesn't mean he can't still make good films. I rented this and popped it into the DVD player, having read reviews of it on .... There, it was classified as an action;martial arts;science fiction hybrid, and that appealed to me. I rented WARRIOR hoping to see some of Lundgren's kung fu on display in an exciting action film.
And that's the problem. This movie has much less action than Lundgren fans and Lundgren himself deserve. Oh, what little action there is in this flick is pretty well staged and has Lundgren showing off his martial arts prowess, and earns this film 2 stars in my book. The story is pretty clever to. An earthquake separating California from the mainland U.S., and it is then overrun by inmates of the maximum securiy prison.
That sounds like the perfect setup for an action film, doesn't it? Of course. So why didn't the filmmakers get it right. Didn't they know that action films THAT HAVE ACTION are popular for a reason? Apparantly not. This is the kind of action film that was made in the days when guys like Davey Crockett were popular. Thank God we've gotten past that.
Lundgren's career seems to be at a crossroads now, not so much because he's stuck doing direct-to-video, but because he did this movie. I have no doubt that his other films and his next film will better more enjoyable than this, but if he does continue to make this kind of action film, where the action is running on empty, he may be demoted further from direct-to-video to released-on-video-after-sitting-on-the-studio-shelf-for-three-years.",1055894400,8,1988,4.7485549132947975
1623279,5,B00005LPZX,"This movie without a doubt has the least amount of action sequences in it then any other Dolph Lundgren movie. And the one that it does have is very short,but skillfully done. Still the movie is never boring. Even though the movie at times does not make since its still has a fairly decent script with solid acting. Definatly worth a rental, and by no means Dolphs worst film.",1044489600,3,376,4.463768115942029
1623280,1,B00005LPZX,"Seldom is a film so bad that I waste my time reviewing it, but this action fiasco is simply so horrible it's worth the effort. I am a fan of the post-apocalyptic genre, and while I've never ranted at the Academy for overlooking him at Oscar time, I have on enough occassions enjoyed Dolph Lungren that I thought we had a chance here. Ninety minutes later, I was ready to go find someone to give me a hug and make me forget having ever seen it. This film fails in every possible way, and action film with no action, a post-apocalyptic with only passing reference to peril and no cool costuming eye candy, a war story with no discernable plot or point, a romance with all the chemistry of a stale pop-tart. This film couldn't even manage to be offensive. I'm sure everyone shares blame in it, the writers, the actors, the director. For goodness sake, if you have some critical need to see this, be it Dolph Lungren fan or masochism, wait for a tv broadcast. Waste as little money as possible.",1026604800,2,990,4.415300546448087
1623281,2,B00005LPZX,"Dolph is the leader of a group of survivors living on an army base after an earthquake isolates California from the rest of the US.
 I love Dolph in just about everything, but this movie really suffered from the lack of a decent script.
The writer, just couldn't seem to decide whether to do a 'survival' film, mad max, or some something like the ""Stand."" What we get is a hodge podge of several decent ideas, with none of them actually going anywhere. Dolph limps valiantly through the storyline, trying to  hold it together, with dialog revolving around eating cans of alpo and finding water.  Plot threads  are left hanging like tinsel.
This movie would've been much better, if they had made it a straight action flick, and left out the hordes of urine drinking, heroin-shooting inmates.
I give this movie 2 stars, for what it could've been.",1012521600,11,844,4.6824324324324325
1623282,4,B00005LPZX,"The Last Warrior starts of pretty good as Dolph Lundgren explains what has happened......which a earthquake destroys the USA and turns the california into a wasteland...........and to top it all off a group of crazy prisoners are looking to kill Dolph Lundgren and his platoon..........The first flaw is the actionscenes (The lack of) When I rent a Dolph Lundgren movie I wanna see the guy kick ..........I may have been spoiled by The Punisher and Blackjack but I really miss him not kicking the ... out of somebody..........Second of all is the story doesn't make sense. And the acting by everybody not named Dolph Lundgren is cliched and trite..........Overall the best way to enjoy this is as a B.movie and despite the lack of action it's better than that turkey ""Agent Red"" The Last Warrior at least boasts some originality........It's better than Jill The Ripper in the fact that it isn't boring. It'd better than Storm Catcher in the fact that it isn't as rushed and poorly executed.....I guess I am basicly reviewing this for Dolph Lundgren fans who have seen those flicks....I won't say that The Last Warrior is as good as Blackjack or Bridge Of Dragons but The Last Warrior is better than The Minion,Storm Catcher,Sweepers,Jill The Ripper and of course (Shudder) Agent Red..........Overall The Last Warrior won't knock your socks off but it won't leave you stunned by the badness of Agent Red.

7944367,2,B00005LPZX,"For some reason, I've been very eager to see this movie for a while. Now that I've watched it, I think I could've held off for another few years. Rumor has it that this one's production wasn't an easy one, and the lackluster quality of the finished product seems to confirm this. Plainly, this is an overwritten action movie without a lot of action. It doesn't look as cheap as it most likely was to make, but it's still a low point in the careers of star Dolph Lundgren and director Sheldon Lettich (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Only-the-Strong/dp/B0000DD76R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Only the Strong</a>).

The story: after a massive earthquake has torn California apart, an amnesiac military captain (Lundgren) leads a gang of survivors against the hardships of their barren surroundings.

Note that my plot summary doesn't mention any specific villain or antagonism that Dolph & co. must overcome - that's because they don't really need to, at least until the movie's last half-hour. There's a bad guy who leads a dismantled prison (played by the late Juliano Mer-Khamis,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadly-Heroes/dp/B00006BT81/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadly Heroes</a>) and its inmates, but even though he's introduced early on, he doesn't become a threat until the last third of the movie when he kidnaps the resident ditz of Dolph's camp (Rebecca Cross,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bachelor/dp/0780630122/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bachelor</a>). Up until then, Dolph spends his time dealing with a strange infection that causes peoples' skin to boil, finding new members to add to his camp, and getting nagged at by the thoroughly annoying Sherri Alexander (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Layover/dp/B00007CVT1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Layover</a>). Trust me when I say that there isn't much of interest going on here. Of course, if there actually were a story worth following for most of the film, it'd be competing for prominence with Dolph's endless exposition monologues and the oversaturated cast, which includes no shortage of misfit characters whose names you won't even bother to remember and whose importance to the film is completely facetious in several cases.

A bit of action might have alleviated some of the boredom I endured while watching the film, but again, there's very little here that's actually worth watching. In the movie's first hour, the action highlight is a scene wherein the characters chase a horse. There's almost nothing between then and the next hour, after which Dolph and a few others infiltrate the prison and there's a bit of punching, shooting, and an explosion or two - again, nothing worth noting.

Another reviewer has commented that this might have been a pilot for a promising TV series, and because of the soundness of the movie's production values, I almost agree - this would have at least presented an opportunity to flesh out the characters a bit more. However, the fact that Lundgren - in the only instance in living memory - had his voice dubbed by another actor for stretches at a time seems to indicate that his attachment to this project was limited, and I doubt he would have wanted to do much more of ""The Last Warrior"" (then again, he needn't have been in a big hurry to do the subsequent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agent-Red/dp/B00013RC4S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agent Red</a>&nbsp;in my opinion). I really can't recommend this to anyone but completionists.",1357516800,,3662,5.87781954887218

The acting was bad, the lines were bad, and the story was bad.  It tries to be a Mad max type movie but fails misserably.  I would give it zero stars if I could but I can't.",1342137600,,346,3.75
