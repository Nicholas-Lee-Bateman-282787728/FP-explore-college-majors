3557747,1,B001EXE328,"the movie was in a good condition but the movie sucks, the movie is not scratched but it always freezes and stops in random times.",1276646400,,130,4.24
3557748,4,B001EXE328,"The premise for Accoralada is a great one. A woman seeks revenge on her old nemesis and searches for her lost daughters--who are in love with the nemesis' sons.

I'm sure had I seen this during its original run (of 180 episodes) I would've experienced all the highs and lows meant to be ensued by all the on screen action, but since I didn't, I had to settle for this chopped up, heavily edited 10 hour version.

The choppiness you can understand. The bloody soap went from being 180 episodes down to ten, so A LOT, and I do me A LOT, had to be edited. One minute a child is kidnapped and the next, the mother has her child again, now for this I'm grateful, I'm not a fan of dragging out the smaller stories; but the editing doesn't work with other aspects of the piece. For instance, how they fall in love, you never know. One minute they meet, the next he's telling her he can't live with out her. Say what? When did that happen?

HOWEVER, the story itself is rather entertaining and I have to admit that the choppiness and the constant ""what the heck just happened"" question kept me highly entertained.

So if you didn't see the soap, or you're a fan of David Zepeda or William Levy, I say buy this DVD (those two in tiny bikinis are worth your money). Sure you might scratch your head and think to yourself ""what just happened"" more than once, but that's part of its charm.",1268697600,12,1377,4.305019305019305
3557749,5,B001EXE328,"I think this soap was great.  It had all the important points to understand the drama with in.  There was only one thing that wasn't clear on edited version, but by comparing this novel to others I think that it was perfectly edited.  I saw the full version but I felt that with this version I saw the whole novel.  I will recomend it.",1250380800,3,335,4.1875
3557750,1,B001EXE328,"Again i am very upset with amazon's false advertising, why do you keep putting  up that this has english subtitles, when that is not the case, please stop putting out these dvds when you know that this is not the case.",1246320000,13,218,4.317073170731708
3557751,1,B001EXE328,"It says it is accoralada which is a completely different soap.  This is actually a movie.  Don't waste your money if you are thinking of one of your favorite spanish soap, beause this is not it.",1241654400,,194,4.361111111111111
3557752,5,B001EXE328,Mi novela favorita al fin en DVD solo espero que no la hayan cortado mucho y nos den todas las escenas claves.,1227398400,,110,4.045454545454546

8299757,2,B001EXE328,"I was disapointed. I guess I expected too much. The best part was seeing William Levy, but  the chopping seemed to come at the worse times. Maybe 4 discs. would have made it flow better.",1406246400,,186,4.314285714285714
8299758,5,B001EXE328,"I had the opportunity of being one of the characters in this telenovela...
I loved my character as the principal of a nurses school!",1384473600,,132,4.541666666666667
8299759,1,B001EXE328,its was rubbish it jump so much they it was not worth watching at all money badly spend and was waiting for it for ages,1363651200,,119,3.8
8299760,5,B001EXE328,"Heavily edited but that is to be expected with any novela DVD. Received item very quickly. Extremely satisfied customer. I love anything with David Zepeda or William Levy, so if you're a fellow fan, it's worth watching.",1358467200,,219,4.945945945945946
8299761,1,B001EXE328,"William Levy is extremely handsome and talented, but Acorralada is not his best work... He isn't even the hero in Acorralada.  I think this SO is his first role on a Latin soap opera. in my opinion, it is crazy expensive.",1338508800,,221,4.390243902439025
8299762,2,B001EXE328,Like another novela I bought(CCEA)I thought just maybe this one would be different. But again I was cheated because its not the full novela. There are chunks of the storyline missing. If don't watch closely you'll be like what the hell just happened.. so don't blink lol you will miss alot...your better off watching this in its entireity on you tube or something.,1312156800,,364,4.7936507936507935

8299764,4,B001EXE328,"Exelente Dvd, Esteticamente tiene una Hermosa Presentacion, la Portada, los Discos, la verdad esta Muy Bonito. En cuanto a la Edicion del Dvd esta muy bien compactado, contiene Lo Mejor de la Telenovela, pese a que son 187 capitulos en un resumen de 10 horas aproximadamente, pero lo bueno que tiene el Dvd es que los resumenes de las Escenas son cortas (no picadas), y hace que la Telenovela se haga super entretenida y a su vez quitan todo lo de relleno, que despues de todo no tiene mucho sentido. Lo que si note es que no tiene la Cancion de Angel Arce Acorralada, en la Entrada, tiene el Tema del Grupo Voz a Voz Perdoname, y lo contadictorio es que durante toda la Novela, en las escenas de Amor se escucha el tema principal, no entiendo porque la quitaron de la Entrada y los Creditos, es raro...
Por otra parte es una Exelente Telenovela, tiene un Gran Elenco, las Actuaciones de Frances Ondiviela y Sonya Smith son Magistrales, ambas son Exelentes Actrices, de primera calidad, a mi particularmente Me Encanta el Personaje de Octavia Irazabal es unico, es una Exelente Villana, como pocas. La verdad que amo este Personaje Antagonico de Frances Ondiviela y quede fascinado con el Dvd de la Telenovela Acorralada, Me Encanta!!! A mi me hubiese gustado que dejaran un poco mas sobre el Final de Deborah Mondragon, la parte en que la Policia encuentra a Marfil ilesa, luego de que Deborah intento matarla y la persecucion, y sobre todo que el Dvd tubiera un poquito mas sobre el Final de Octavia Irazabal.",1305072000,,1511,4.662921348314606
