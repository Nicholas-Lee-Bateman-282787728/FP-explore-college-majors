8013466,5,B0001JXP7A,A classic archery film made in a bygone era long before political correctness cluttered people's minds!  Howard Hill was a legend in his time and a absolutly amazing archer. This film depicts an african adventure during more innocent times.,1298764800,2,240,5.153846153846154
8013467,4,B0001JXP7A,"This is a very good archery hunting video and it is the first Longbow man to take down a Elephant.

I enjoyed the video and it was back when this was a major motion picture.",1207180800,2,173,3.942857142857143
8013468,4,B0001JXP7A,"Ok...So I grew up in an archery household.  Dad owned an archery shop and bow hunted.  I hunted(read donate arrows to the arrow gods!)

All my life I had heard of Howard Hill and his amazing skill with a long bow.  I knew he was the shooter for Earol Flynn's Robin Hood, but to see what this man can do in real time is astonishing....

On safari in Africa Howard hill shoots a charging lion, pins an attacking crocodile, and takes down a rouge elephant...all with a long bow!

This movie is un pc to say the least as it was done in I think the 1930's, but with that said if you are a bow hunter or an archer you have to see this!",1135641600,9,629,3.992
