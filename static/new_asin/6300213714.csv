228189,5,6300213714,I love this movie and finally bought it.  I didn't realize until after I bought it that it is the director's cut.  I don't know how this one differs from the theatrical release since I've only watch the movie on regular TV in the past.,1522713600,,235,4.2

228233,4,6300213714,"I am rating this movie keeping in mind that it is four decades old and should be considered when being watched today. However, great movie's always stand the test of time and this is no different. Keeping in mind that it is a 1970's movie the action and dialogue aren't too over the top and the acting is actually very good. Always fun to finally watch a movie and see where famous catchphrases come from! ..."" Can you dig it? And ...""Warriors, come out to play-e-ay"". Definitely worth a watch.",1521504000,,494,4.5

228239,1,6300213714,"Do not watch the director's cut! Walter Hill (the director) really butchered this one. He took all of the suspense and eeriness out of the film with ridiculous comic book panels and deleted scenes.
Back when I first watched the movie online (yarr harr) I loved it so much that I went out and bought it to watch with my brother. Imagine my disappointment when the the movie felt completely different and even boring. My brother's opinion of the movie was forever one of mediocrity. I don't want this to happen to you.
Unfortunately, the only version of ""The Warriors"" available physically is this director's garbage. Please, do yourself a favor and find the theatrical version... somewhere.",1520553600,,689,4.897435897435898

228267,1,6300213714,"Terrible storyline, caricatures not characters, romanticizes hoods and bad acting. Dialogue has no resemblance to 1970s NYC street where I grew up. If you want better acting, a little realism and a few laughs, watch ""The Wanderers"" which was released in the same year about early 1960s NYC gangs. I never understood how this movie became a cult classic - perhaps, it's middle America's perception of urban life at the time. ""The Wanderers"" is becoming a cult classic and it's about time.",1519689600,,487,4.951219512195122

228270,5,6300213714,"I'm always a little weary of ""old school movies"" some are entertaining and others are horrible with video, audio, or poor acting issues. The Warriors movie was funny, engaging, and entertaining with an old school flavor. A gang war breaks out after the death of a notorious leader is killed. The Warriors gang has a serious problem... try to make it back to Coney Island... alive. Watching the different gangs decked out in different attire was hilarious. A great action Saturday night movie. This is not a family movie due to the level of violence. However, it's not anywhere near as violent as some of the movies out there on the market today. Overall, a funny old school movie, with entertaining scenes, and good strong characters. I appreciate you for taking time out to read my review. I hope it is informative.",1519344000,,816,4.753521126760563

228295,5,6300213714,"THE WARRIORS (1979) is a traditional adventure / journey / quest film, set in modern times. It's also a fantasy film, concerning New York City street gangs. Each wearing their own individualized, highly recognizable ""colors"". When big gang kahuna, Cyrus (Roger Hill), leader of The Riffs, calls a midnight meeting of nine representatives each, from a hundred different gangs, his vision of a huge, city-wide takeover seems like a great idea. Oh no! Going against the set rules, Luther (David Patrick Kelly- DREAMSCAPE, COMMANDO, THE CROW) from The Rogues brings a gun, and shoots Cyrus dead. Not surprisingly, Luther blames THE WARRIORS. Chaos and karate ensue. Now, the gang must attempt to get from The Bronx to their home turf on Coney Island, while being hunted by every other gang in the city! This includes groups like The Furies, a baseball themed gang, wearing face-paint, dressed in Yankee pinstripes, and carrying bats! They even emerge from a dugout! Then, there's the Turnbull Ac's, a skinhead gang in a school bus! When THE WARRIORS are forced to split up, the real trouble / fun begins! Of course, there's the all-female gang, The Lizzies too! Luther's Rogues are a leather-clad, biker looking bunch of total scumbags. Luther himself, is memorable as being totally off the rails! Kelly plays him w/ gusto, making him seem unpredictable and capable of anything. As for The Riffs, they're a militant army of never-smiling, serious, kung fu fighters! THE WARRIORS, led by Swan (Michael Beck), are a diverse, entertaining collection of hard-a$$es. James Remar is a standout as Ajax. Throughout, the mysterious DJ (Lynne Thigpen) provides the music and appropriate commentary, (a la Cleavon Little in VANISHING POINT) for THE WARRIORS' progress toward their goal. At once, absolutely ludicrous and brilliant, this movie is power-packed from start to finish! There are so many quotable lines, you may as well memorize the movie's entire script! The comeuppance finale is perfect, and the ending will have you singing Joe Walsh tunes f-o-r-e-v-e-r! Oh yeah!...",1518393600,7,2067,5.173134328358209
228296,5,6300213714,Ive been waiting for so long for this movie to be released in HD like I saw it at the theater back in the day.  So over joyed to be able to visit one of my favorite movies from the past.  Cant even begin to tell you how disappointed I was when the directors cut blu ray came up and ruined a movie I considered to be a classic.

228348,5,6300213714,"This movie is NOT some deep poignant thriller making a statement about social unrest, poverty, and the angst of youth in the seventies who were too young to be immersed in the hippie dream like the book is. This movie is an unremitting, unapologetic, CULT CLASSIC like Rocky Horror, Shock Treatment, or most closely of all, John Carpenter's Escape from New York.

I have read the comments about the addition of the graphic novel cutaways as though someone had damaged a some sacred item like the dome of the rock. RIDICULOUS!!!! This movie is the FIRST CYBERPUNK-type movie years ahead of the genre itself (you could say it's pre-Cyber and Punk. It is almost a Richard Linklatter movie, and if he had been old enough at the time, I've NO doubt he would have been involved in the project. The movie has the air of a serious graphic novel, not some academy award-winning thriller. It IS what it IS, and for my part, that is GREAT!!!!

The additions of the graphic novel portions to this movie have ENHANCED it even beyond what it was originally. It has ALWAYS been sort of a gritty graphic novel on screen to me. The pre-cyberpunk theme comes out clearly in the sandwiched graphic novel format, and especially with the added tale of the soldiers who had to return home from a distant land read by Tom Berringer's deep, rich voice, caused an effect that simply KNOCKED ME OUT. The original should absolutely have had this- but it probably wouldn't have had Tom Berringer, so maybe it was worth the wait.

To the rest of you yammering like this is something akin to Greedo shooting first, just be quiet!!! That is what is known in formal logic as a ""false equivalency"". I can school you further on proper syllogistic form and defense should you wish, but I think we should all just calm down and enjoy the movie, and the improvement. If you don't like it, there are plenty of non-director's cut versions available and for streaming.",1512604800,,1928,4.631578947368421
228349,3,6300213714,"OK MOVIE.  NOT TOO INSIGHTFUL. JUST A MOVIE ON ""SOME "" OF THE GANGS IN NYC.",1511222400,,75,3.6875
228380,2,6300213714,I remembered this movie from long ago and wanted to see it again. They ruined it by splicing in small sections of comic book scenes. That was never in the original movie. What a disappointment.,1510876800,2,193,4.542857142857143
228381,5,6300213714,"My boyfriend and I loved this film and both remembered seeing it on TV when we were younger (late '80s/early '90s). For those out there who actually got to see this film in the theater or in its original version, you probably already knew this, but for kids like us who only ever saw it in the cut-up, edited-for-TV version, I didn't even know this film had comic-book-style intros to each 'chapter' or scene! It lent a whole new perspective to the movie -- the characters no longer seem so overtly silly, because knowing that it was kind of comic-book-inspired, it made more sense that the different gangs were so colorful and outrageous in their silly hollywood-ized styles and themes. Having the comic-book intros cut out of the film and seeing it on TV with commercials is totally different than watching the whole thing through in its original form. It's an underrated cult classic and I was happy to find it on Blu-Ray last Christmas as a stocking stuffer for my man.",1510704000,3,973,4.662790697674419

228426,3,6300213714,"This is still a great movie, but the additions really detract from it in my opinion. The intro talks briefly about the source material for the plot, Anabasis by Xenophon. Even in this first segment, the lack of care is obvious. Instead of Greek soldiers from 400 BC, it shows Roman soldiers from around 9 BC. It certainly raises the question of why anyone would take the time to do this, without even a little attention to detail. However, this is only an opening introduction, so even though it's poorly done, it is easily ignored once the movie starts.

The other sticking point is the comic book transitions. Rather than hiring an artist to illustrate scenes, the transitions look like they were done with a simple software filter, lacking any kind of artistry or unique appearance. The text boxes in the panels are also irritating, as they either explain the obvious (saying things like ""meanwhile"") or they are inappropriate to the events (one says ""Holy s**t!"" right after an intense moment).

If there were any scenes added or tweaked I certainly didn't object to them, and may not have even noticed. The overall story still plays out really well, and the whole movie looks great on Blu-Ray, especially the iconic radio station scenes. However, I would recommend that anyone interested in this movie should shop around to see if there is a different Blu-Ray version without the new transitions.",1506816000,,1401,4.857740585774058
228427,1,6300213714,"Do not waste your money. This is the Director's Cut and not the theatrical release. Originally when I purchased it, it was advertised as the theatrical release; I even asked for an exchange, and got this abomination yet again. I see that the misleading wording has been changed now.

However, the Director's Cut is terrible; I have never liked it. The original theatrical release draws you in and by the end of the film you feel the hopelessness that The Warriors feel. The Director's Cut destroys that by placing idiotic comic book-like headers between scenes. It breaks up the movies into chapters and loses the moodiness and hopelessness the theatrical release exudes. This is one case where the director's vision was completely wrong.",1506816000,,738,5.0

Guys, there's a reason why the original edits were made and it still holds true today.

I thought making things digital instead of physical was supposed to DECREASE the price!?
Also, a blog post from 2015 said that this movie was free via Prime, which is no longer the case. Amazon and/or Viacom must really enjoy forcing people to pay a bunch of money on a movie that's almost 40 years old.

228580,5,6300213714,"This is one of my very favorite movies of all time.  It's a story about a street gang from Coney Island that gets invited to a big gang conclave in the Bronx, and has to battle its way back through a hostile city to get back home -- a battle made more difficult by the fact that the gang is (spoiler alert!) unfairly blamed for the murder of the leader who called the gangs together for their big meeting.  It's an exciting, well-paced tale of adventure and courage against great odds.  I first saw it on HBO when I was ten, and I liked it then, I remember.  I had no idea at the time that the movie's plot was based on the Anabasis of Xenophon.  I figured that out when I was in college, before I'd actually read Xenophon's work and knew it only by outline, and I recognized the plot similarities, and the sprinkling of Greek or Persian names in ""The Warriors"" (e.g. Ajax, Cleon, Cyrus).  The movie has grown to become one of my favorites over the years.  The Ultimate Director's Cut will make the connection clear to any viewer in the opening narration.  That said, I dislike the opening narration, and the illustrated comic book inter-titles peppered throughout the film.  They are totally unnecessary, and they give the film an almost campy element it does better without, in my opinion.  The movie can be enjoyed on its own merits by viewers who are totally unaware of the connection to Anabasis, and if they ever figure it out, or have it pointed out, it just adds one more enjoyable layer to the experience.

I have read that Walter Hill always wanted to opening narration (and tried to get Orson Welles to narrate it) but budgetary considerations, and studio influence kept that from happening.  This is one time when interference from the studio suits may have actually improved the film -- it happens sometimes; sometimes artists do their best work when forced to operate within constraints they'd rather do without.  It forces them to be more creative and subtle.  Would Jaws be as enjoyable if you saw a lot of the shark, for example?  Spielberg had to rely on unseen menace and the audience's imaginations, because the mechanical shark didn't work as well as desired, and they had to limit its screen time, resulting in a better, more suspenseful film.  In a somewhat similar way, perhaps the lack of narration and other clues to connect ""The Warriors"" to Xenophon's story made Hill tell the movie's story better on its own.  In any case, I think the theatrical version, without  these later additions, is the far better version of the film.  I really wish they'd release a version on blu ray that had both the theatrical, and director's cut versions.  As it is, if you want to see the film in its sharpest, best presented version, visually, you have to buy the director's cut blu ray edition.  If you want to see the better, theatrical version, you have to find one of the old, now out of production DVDs with the different cover, which has that version of the film, and accept the lower video quality as the price to be paid for seeing the superior version of the movie.",1495843200,11,3085,4.562613430127041

228583,2,6300213714,"This film has accrued much hype and a large following, but in my honest view it's just a celebration of debauchery with a soft surrealism. The credits proclaim that the movie is an adaptation of a book. It's hard to gauge what the content of the book is with the films strange pace and content. The plot is of an alternate universe where crime and other negative influences have overcome the forces of law and order, but conflict is surprisingly tame. It has to be assumed that the film rating system was a cause for toning down the violence. The setting is New York City in the eighties, like many other pieces that laud criminality or vice. Gangs run the city, varying in organization from (not believable) almost paramilitary to barely scraping by (though their livelihood isn't comprehensible). Only the city is real, the protagonists exist in a life that's not fathomable and the antagonists are just the same, but with more flare. The paramour of the main star is even less believable when you reflect on her confessions of basically living anywhere and having sex at random while being in destitute poverty. The climax is pulled together by the director's will alone; creating a chance timing of fate and skill that's just so lucky. It was nice to see once, but wouldn't recommend or watch again.",1494720000,,1303,4.744493392070485

228889,4,6300213714,"One of my favorite older movies. Sure, the plot's not the deepest, which  borrows from Greek/Roman times the theme about a stranded army (or at least a gang of 9, dang, make that 8, oops, 7, oh well, I mean 6) fights its way back home, in this case, to Coney Island. Some of the incidents are not credible(crazy killer voluntarily pays for candy instead of walking off), but the action is what you watch this for. The fight between the Warriors and the Baseball Furies is one of the best. Don't expect anything deep and you'll enjoy it.  If you wondered where Shaq got that ""Can you dig it?"" quote, this was where HE got it from.

This is one of my favorite all time movies about a gang cut off from their home turf and having to fight almost every gang in ny to get back home because they get blamed for a shooting they weren't responsible for. If you want to get rational ,yes they are a gang who like other gangs do violent things to innocent people but in the original cut you have to admire their courage and bravery against overwhelming odds. This is a 5 star movie in any action pictures book but the director ruined the original cut by slowing down the action and turning it into a cartoon story instead of the true action picture it was.this is the reason I give it 3 stars.the director should be ashamed of himself but I assume he was paid well to ruin his own classic.",1475539200,,855,4.35

229208,2,6300213714,"Gang warfare in the boroughs of NYC, seen at their absolute grimiest. This is a film that's admirable for its inner fire, and its determination, if not for its execution or storytelling. In a sense, it almost works as a sheer abstract; lingering shots of graffiti-laden subway cars and dark, wet city streets abound, lending it value as something of a time capsule in the modern light. The plot is adorably simple, though, and overacted at every turn. It's no surprise to see this as the first or second film on nearly every actor's resume, although I'm not sure a more accomplished thespian could do more with the script, which left me laughing from its sheer absurdity more than once. It's more of a visual film anyway, reliant upon the cityscapes and quaintly-themed gang ensembles to do most of the heavy lifting. That's a wise decision, as it's generally entertaining to look at, though the aforementioned gangs vary from laughable (an entire syndicate of mimes) to, actually, pretty cool (lots of stylish fedoras in this flick). Unfortunately, there's a serious lack of violence for this kind of picture (flight seems to be the word of the day) and the second act drags on for so long, there's barely any time for adequate resolution at the end. A valiant effort, not to mention an influential one, but not a particularly good film of its own right.",1474416000,,1355,4.770212765957447

229337,3,6300213714,"I can't tell you how many times in my late teens/early 20's this movie was thrown onto the VCR while we partied on a weekend. We ALL loved it. And it still holds up decades later as a training manual for filmmakers with limited/low budgets. It proves what you can get on film with the leanest of pocket books. A bigger budget would not have made this a better movie. Having said that....
I can appreciate Walter Hill finally giving us his ""original vision"" of how he saw the film....BUT as in the case with Lucas, do what you want to your precious ""DIRECTORS CUT"" as long as you provide the original version was well AND in the same HD quality. Personally I don't think the comic additions work at all this many years later...perhaps if it had been done that way from the beginning with 1979 artwork being used and Orson Welles doing the narration it would have worked, but it just doesn't. It's like re-touching an 19th century painting to make it more accessible to a current audience. As I watched the film I tried to just watch this version, it was okay. Did it elevate the movie? make it better... not at all. The film ran to the end and I was glad I still had my original DVD version that I will prefer to watch ESPECIALLY with the intact tail credit scene with all the Warriors walking off into a log lens sunset which is TOTALLY destroyed by this new cut. When the ""new"" version was done I felt so robbed of the emotion at the end I had to eject the blu-ray and stick in my original DVD version and re-watch the whole credit scene.",1466640000,,1539,4.310344827586207

Even if you don't like the ULTIMATE DIRECTOR'S CUT buy both versions anyway. Show respect for Samantha (Sam Shaber) and her father David and watch these movies. They're worth the money.

229580,3,6300213714,"I've always loved the premise behind The Warriors. A gang having to fight their way through an entire city of distinctive enemy gangs to make it home? That sounds like a great time. Based on its reputation, when I first watched it I expected to be blown away. But when I finished, all I could think was ""That's it?""

The film wasn't near as action packed as I was hoping. Most of the encounters with the gangs out to get them end with The Warriors running away, and there are only two full blown fight scenes in the movie. Even the climax is completely boring. While the fight scenes the movie does have are well done, neither of them are entertaining enough to make up for how dull the rest of the film is.

Perhaps the film could've been saved if the characters had any depth. But the movie comes up short in that aspect too. We never find out anything about the gang members. We don't know what led them to become gang members, or what they hope to achieve. The closest the film comes to exploring the pointlessness of gang life comes down to one brief conversation near the end of the night. Even the event that kicked off the plot is revealed to have been done for no reason at all. I've never felt the romance between Swan and Mercy added to the film, and wish it had been replaced with something more exciting or interesting. The movie may be cheesy, but that doesn't mean it needs to be shallow.

I've watched the movie multiple times, and to this day I don't understand why the movie is so highly rated. It certainly has a distinctive style. I just wish it had more than that.",1452988800,,1585,4.32996632996633

The story is so slow and nothing to talk about. Just a bunch of stupid street gangs wandering around doing nothing. Is this supposed to be worriors?
No, i don't thing so. Why they are called as such?
They are doing nothing but fighting with each other for nothing. Chaseing each other, kick each other's ass.

Simple plot mixed with fight scenes, which aren't martial arts spectacles but more like brawls. Kept thinking throughout the movie why The Warriors didn't just take a taxi back home.

I did not bother seeing it when it came out because as a native New Yorker the gang outfits looked ridiculous to me compared to what I knew the gangs wore.

230085,2,6300213714,"I thought this movie was gonna have a lot of violence, yet it barely has any. These ""gangsters"" don't look like any gangs I've seen. A gang of mimes? A gang of baseball players with painted faces? Oh, and lets not forget our Abercrombie & Douchebag gang, The Warriors. Talk about showing skin, why not put them in short shorts while you're at it?

The story is ridiculous, and the girl that eventually joins her is even more ridiculous. ""I can take care of myself."" Sure, it's the boys who do all the fighting, what exactly do you do?

Why is this a cult classic? I get Nightmare on Elm Street, Halloween, Pulp Fiction, Saw, there's a ton of films that are cult classics, but what's so special about this one? You want a real gang film? Watch New Jack City.

Oh wait, I guess this is a cult classic because most of the gangsters are white. Yeah, very realistic, not.",1442620800,,866,4.366459627329193

230198,5,6300213714,"this was one of the first blu rays to come out. And there was a reason for that . It was such a huge hit and remains a cult favorite to this day. The cast did  a great job in this movie and it was a no apology type of film featuring violent gang members who were  easy to relate to because they just wanted to get home to safety.  Of course at the time, new York was collapsing in reality from crime and violence.  It was one of the worst places in the u.s.  The Detroit of it's time in some areas.  It's much better now.  But the movie had to deal with real gangs who caused problems and sometimes even helped out.  The film also had a slick style with fantastic music behind it.  today gangs are bloddthirsty drug dealers mainly, back t then most of them were local groups who could be as bad as today or not.  This version is the directors cut , so you get more of this and it helps to have a young Debbie valkenburg in it. She had real sex appeal and has had a successful career in Hollywood ever since. Most the other cast members were not so lucky at all.  Still it's a walter hill film and that guy makes great action movies too. Like 48 hours.  and others.  The man complaint at the time was that this movie was pro gang , but in reality it doesn't glamourize gangs at all.  you wouldn't want to be a in gang unless you had to be. And new York at the time was so awful at the time that this movie wasn't far off from reality.  Soo.  It's like watching a western set in the wild bad city of New York of that era.  And it was no joke.  Watch it for that aspect. The blu ray looks great here with lots of extras and such.",1441756800,,1626,3.9355828220858897

The warriors were turf oriented gang members who were daring, somewhat reckless, and who expressed the general machismo mores common to gangs of their era. The plot is an interesting one where an across the board truce is proclaimed by the most powerful gang leader so that all of the gangs can cross turf lines in order to gather and unite. What follows that makes for an interesting and well done story more than less reflecting the general gang ""codes"" and mores of the time in history represented.

230861,5,6300213714,"When people talk about grindhouse movies, then know that the quintessential film of this discussion has to be Walter Hill's 1979 masterpiece The Warriors. This movie is a rollercoaster ride of pure atmosphere and visual imagery that perfectly creates its own fantasy world while encapsulating the crime-infested streets of New York City circa the 1970s.

I'm obviously a fan of this movie on many levels and every since my introduction to it as a child, I have introduced numerous friends to this film. Nobody has ever been disappointed with the cinematic journey that The Warriors takes them on. Amazingly now that New York has been ""corporatized"" and made family-friendly, watching a movie like this opens a doorway into a world that no longer exists. Much like this summer's Mad Max: Fury Road, The Warriors can almost be appreciated dialogue-free as the visuals take center-stage over plot and characterization. If you have never seen this movie, go check it out or revisit it. The podcast Don and his Amazing Friend recently did a thorough review of the movie as well.

231222,5,6300213714,"This review is for the original release of The Warriors on DVD. I couldn't find that release on Amazon; all I could find was the Director's Cut, which most people say is very bad.

When Kramer found himself being chased by guys in baseball uniforms during an episode of Seinfeld, I'll bet generations of younger viewers had no idea what Seinfeld and co-writer Larry David were referring to. The Warriors is one of those films that occupy the fringe of 70's classics. It's good enough that some people remember it, but its shortcomings are always in danger of making it forgettable.

The shortcomings are obvious. The variable acting and rambling plot make the movie difficult to take seriously. The dialog about how tough things are in the city is either stylized or clichd.

The strengths are also obvious. Some reviewers complained that Hill was trying to compensate for his lack of material with ""verve"" and ""pizzazz."" However, Hill displays enough verve and pizzazz in the first 15 minutes of his movie to last for this and many other lifetimes. I've never seen plot exposition handled with such dexterity and aplomb as Hill handles it here. It really is one of the visual highlights of the movie. Other examples of Hill's considerable gifts are the much praised ""Furies"" attack in Central Park. Another very fine moment is the rumble in the men's room.

This movie's greatest strength--much praised but never adequately praised--is Andrew Laszlo's cinematography. I'm watching this movie on a 32-inch Samsung widescreen panel and it looks FABULOUS! Laszlo's old-school photography--shot on film mostly at night under fluorescent and neon lighting--looks better than a lot of digital, Blu-Ray releases I've seen (I won't mention any names).

And, if I may revisit the topic of this movie's putative lack of a theme, I believe that Hill does manage to tease a theme out of his material by the end of the movie. Hill is advancing a non-violence message. He's showing there's a difference between walking away from a fight and choosing a better alternative to fighting. The Warriors realize that NYC, with all its petty fiefdoms, isn't much different than Vietnam or the South Pacific. Endless slaughter over postage-stamps of territory has to stop sooner or later. So the Warriors walk off into the sunset looking for greener pastures and a brighter tomorrow. (How's that for a clich?!)",1438473600,,2388,5.005037783375315

Set in modern New York City, with street gangs replacing the ancient warriors, it's a gritty tale of survival. If you're old enough to remember the 70s and what NYC was like then (and may be returning to now), it's a flashback to violent streets filled with crime and garbage. The acting is good and photography captures the mood of that time.

232584,5,6300213714,"Cyrus (Roger Hill), the leader of the largest street gang the Gramercy Riffs holds a gang meeting in the Bronx. He invites 9 delegates of the local gangs in an attempt to call a truce. His plan is to unite the gangs into one organization, with intentions on conquering New York City one borough at a time. During the ovation, he's gunned down by a gang leader whom places the blame on another gang from Coney Island called the Warriors. Chaos ensues and the Warriors realize that the truce may have been called off, and they may have to fight their way back home. However, completely unknown to them, the Riffs place a bounty on them and now every gang in the city is after their heads. -summary

Normally when I hear the title ""cult classic"", I think the worst and commence on my merry way into the other direction for something else. It's no secret that 90% of the time, the title ""cult classic"" means garbage that I like. Through out the years I have wasted tons of money and time on lackluster projects that some folks find enjoyment in. Fortunately, the 1979 action thriller The Warriors, does not fall into that category. This is one of those times that ""cult classic"" isn't just a label that was stupidly tossed around. Here it is rightfully earned, and although Warriors may not be among the greatest films ever made. It's definitely among the greatest B-movies ever made and it's among my favorites. I see the movie at least twice every year and I have owned it in some form either on VHS or DVD for the last 28 years; now that's longevity right there.

Directed and co-written by Walter Hill, The Warriors follows a group of friends that must overcome incredible obstacles ranging from rival gangs to the police force. The plot is very well paced mixing up some good character interactions and injecting action when reasonably called for. The action scenes are clearly the best feature of the film, and they're pretty much what it's remembered for. They mainly consist of straight up and gritty fisticuffs, with a baseball bat or two used here and there. There are no over the top and over-exaggerated fight scenes like you get in many of todays action films, or incredibly skinny women knocking out two hundred pound men. These battles feature rugged and battle hardened men just getting down and dirty, with the occasional beat to death moment somewhere in the beginning.

The characters were tailored made for the gritty atmosphere, and the sense of isolation and existentialism can be felt through out the dark neighborhoods and the characters demeanor. The gangs are unique in their look representing their crews through uniformity, with each of them bearing a clear distinction from other gangs; crews such as the skin headed, denim outfitted jacket and jeans crew the Turnbull AC's, or the baseball bat wielding Baseball Furies. The gangs are indeed intimidating, I seriously wouldn't want to be caught up in a beef with the former crew, or ran up on at night solo in a park with the latter. Hill did a great job here with the make up and creativity of these outfits. I also feel that the character development is pretty strong, as the viewer will get to know many of the characters personalities.

The Warriors is also one of those type of films that shows you how a great soundtrack can make a film much better. The BGM which is made up of rock songs and synthesized music scores, fits in very well with the urban background and dark feel of the film. There are so many listenable tracks in this movie that it makes the soundtrack a must hear. Although there were some wooden performances, the small issues with the acting doesn't really hamper the film much in my view.

After watching this film, many folks will come away feeling as if they only saw a mindless action movie. For a very long time that's also what I've seen until I became more well rounded in film. The Warriors is definitely more than that, as it well utilizes themes as brotherhood and hope, and it doesn't feel the least bit ham-fisted. I think the film well uses the ""show and don't tell"" element very effectively.

Any way you slice it up, whether you care for the subtle themes or not and even though it can have a cheesy feel at times. The Warriors has more than enough going for it to entertain most action fans. The lack of nudity and over the top bloody scenes adds to it as well. I highly recommend this to serious movie buffs and B-movie lovers. The film has a 93 minute run time that goes by way too quick.

Pros:Action, stylish, and atmospheric, amazing 70's soundtrack

Cons: Some wooden performances",1428537600,2,4602,4.624235006119951

The fact that it may have paralleled the story about the 300 Spartans is great but frankly better left unsaid. In an attempt to somewhat 'modernize' this movie, adding the comic book transitions and prologue it effectively re-dated it and made it look much more cheesy and less genuine.

232944,3,6300213714,"Alarmingly shallow but fast moving film about an urban street gang known as the Warriors (of the famous title) who all must do battle with various other warring gangs of their region when a psychotic man murderers an important gangland figure, a figure who wanted to lead the other rival gangs on a road to unity in the hopes of combatting the small armies of police.
Although the film looks great, I am eternally suspicious of any film made by Walter Hill (although ""Southern Comfort"", despite its weak box office returns, is an interesting film) as a product of someone who was one foot away from sliding over the edge of moviemaking plausibility (if not, to my reasoning, respectability). To me, ""The Warriors"" is far too 80s rather than 70s (though the release was in 1979, this does not FEEL much like a true 70s movie, and it was admittedly ahead of its time with its apparent idea that the story (if there is one) doesn't count and that the important thing to do is to get on with it anyway). Not a great influence upon cinema (if you ask me), but an influential one nonetheless. ""The Warriors"" is far too musical to be a good action story, and yet it is not grim enough (or violent enough) to be a classic genre entry either. But this is because, I suspect, that Walter Hill wanted to make a film that was more moody (and less gory) than other gangster pictures, and don't be surprised if you get a ""Flashdance"" or ""Saturday Night Fever"" feeling from some of this...""Death Wish"" this is certainly not. It is astoundingly light in tone and in texture for an alleged gangster picture, and it certainly doesn't stand up as well under that influence, despite the unfortunate Greek history references that open (the new version of) the movie, and the role of David Patrick Kelly (who would go on to become one of cinema's better mainstream movie crazies). At times it feels inauthentic as a street movie, and at other times it seems as if Hill's uncertainty and hesitation about the genre is holding him back from achieving any kind of greatness here. Pauline Kael's review praised it (and as Hill says in one of the sections of the 'making of' documentary offered on the DVD, the longer print reviews were more positive in their readings), but I find the film to be lacking in both dramatic weight and creativity to give it a truly passing grade. However, this new ""comic book"" Ultimate Director's Cut is the only one version of this picture that I have seen, so I have not had a chance to watch it in the original version (nor have I read the Sol Yurick's source novel for the original screenplay, but I gather from what I have read about the film that the book was not kept in tact in the apparent translation). Hopefully, however, Yurick collected some money for having sold the book rights, but I suspect that the later gang war outbreaks at cinemas put the brakes to the floor for the film for a while after its initial release; unfortunate, since ""The Warriors"" is not as offensive as it would like to think itself to be.
On a happy note, Barry DeVorzon's score is actually one of my favorites, and probably more substantial than the film. There is also a great score to the film that includes several rock music pieces, most offered without vocals, which breaks up the DeVorzon bits. Andrew Laszlo's amazing cinematography is genuinely effective, but the film is a case of style trumping every other circumstance of merit.
The Widescreen print on this DVD is very good (to these eyes), but again I have not seen the original and I am admitting that. The 4-part 'making of' documentary is generally informative and fun to watch (especially Frank Marshall's scenes) and it's satisfying enough. The original theatrical trailer is also included.

 Please Mr. Hill, for all that is holly, release the original The Warriors in DVD or even better In BLU - RAY, the original 1979 the warriors.  Because with  "" The Warriors ( The ultimate Director's cut )""  you have relegated a great and entertaining movie to the $2.50 or less priced bin of movies next to Ishtar and Gigli that most people don't want. ""
I remember watching this movie in south america as a little kid not long before I came to live in the great U.S. of A.
I remember it filled my mind with wonder seeing New York and these band of brothers facing great odds to make it to safety, it may sound silly but I think it might even helped  plant a seed in me to persevere in difficult times faced later on, either in the military or life in general. I know someone reading this would find it easy to be cynical and say "" aw, come on "". However, if we look back in life we might be surprise to find what tidbits we took from what we saw and/or heard growing up that made a deep impression. As just another impressionable kid is easy to associate the courage and perseverance displayed in the movie as a main ingredient to being a man. And why not, aren't those great human qualities to try to emulate ? We might not display them fighting gangs necessarily, but don't worry life will throw obstacles along your way anyways. Then like the warriors you may also need to cowboy up and press forward.
Please Mr. Hill, undo your proverbial Jar Jar Binks that you have unleashed on this movie and those of us who do love it.

233149,1,6300213714,"Before I get started I would like to clarify that ""The Warriors"" is (in my opinion) a 5 star movie.  The 1 star is for the ""Ultimate Directors Cut"", which is basically the ultimate workshop in what NOT to do with a classic film.  Walter Hill made changes to this movie that would make even George Lucas say ""Too much bro"".  And the most hilarious part is that in the Introduction by Walter Hill (which was included on the DVD I saw, not sure if it's on the Blu Ray), he talks about how he doesn't like when director's go back and change their films... then launches into how that's exactly what he's doing.  And it's terrible.

Do you remember that dark/gritty/low-budget classic you grew up watching late night on cable in the 80's and 90's?  Well it's a comic book now.  And I don't mean that in a figurative way, like they dumbed it down or something, I mean it's a comic book.  In one of the dumbest alterations in the history of film alterations, a comic book framing device is now used, to make it look like scenes are comic book panels that come to life.  One scene ends, the frame freezes as the image turns into a comic book style drawing, and the camera pans to the next panel (the beginning of the next scene), usually with some stupid dialogue bubble, and that drawing transforms into the frozen frame of the next scene which begins.  It is unbelievably stupid, corny and really ruins the tension in many sections of the film.

There's also the added introduction, which seems more like Walter Hill trying to justify this low-budget gang flick as high art, and ""church it up"", by up-playing the 300 Spartans inspiration.  Because it's historical, remember how the Spartans had to rumble with the Baseball Furies?  That's not so bad though, unnecessary, but unlike the previously mentioned changes it doesn't destroy the film.

Hopefully one day they'll release the REAL version of this movie, but it's been a long time since they've done that.  For the last 10 years this junk has been the official release.  It wouldn't be so bad if they made both versions available, like many directors will put the theatrical and directors cuts together in the same release.  But they didn't, just the ruined version.  And just like Star Wars, I refuse to purchase this movie until they return it to its original glory.",1417824000,9,2318,4.598540145985401

This movie is a classic and everybody should see it. One of the best movies Water Hill directed. I first saw this movie on VHS because I wasn't old enough to watch it in a teather (had to be 18). It was a big sensation when it came out, and still very good by today's standards. I bought the original version in Amazon from Windaria in DVD format.

The original theatrical release is the one we all remember and that younger folks who weren't around then should see.  That's the film we all talk about.

The Director's Cut... wow, it's astounding how badly a director can ruin his own film.  All through the movie, he messes it up.  And then he coup de grace, ruining the final scene that plays out under the credits, where they are walking away from us on the beach.

As for the film itself - it is truly strange.  It's surreal.  We have ""street gangs"" of mixed races (which just doesn't happen), shiny clothes, roller skates, and the famously painted faces.  How can something so hokey be so cool?  Maybe it's because the opening sequence with the Wonder Wheel, subways, and theme music (which has stood up to time very well) just pulls you in.

The scene in which the Warriors encounter the Furies.

The ""Wonder Wheel"" opening by inserting an absolutely unnecessary animate reference to Anabasis before it. And, worst of all, he obliterated the wonderful ending scene.

I became so obsessed with the game, I just had to watch the movie.  It was cool putting a real face to each character from the game.  The game makes  Swan look a lot older than he is in the movie lol.

 Overall, I eenjoyed the game  so much,  it made me watch the movie. I had the game for ps2  YEARS ago.  I lost it but I missed the game so much that I had to buy it for  my PSP  and it's byfar  best PSP game i've played.  Til this day, I still turn my PSP  on some days and play the game!

The armies of the night number 100000; they outnumber the police 5 to 1; and tonight they're after the Warriors - a street gang blamed unfairly for a rival gang leader's death.

This contemporary action-adventure story takes place in the sub-culture of gang warfare that rages from Coney Island to Manhattan to the Bronx. Members of the Warriors fight for their lives seek to survive in the urban jungle and learn the meaning of loyalty. This intense and stylized film is a dazzling achievement for cinematographer Andrew Laszlo.

I hate the fact a whole new generation of people will watch this disgraced version for the first time. The powerful segue-ways during the Baseball Furies chase / the dusk to dawn sequence from the train to the Wonder Wheel towards the end and that final amazing scene during the credits...are RUINED by the juvenile comic book stills. These unnecessary interruptions take away the tension, suspense and just ruin the cohesiveness and momentum of the movie in a very significant and desecrating way. Walter Hill the great director should have fired Walter Hill the worst editor ever. The extras that include interviews with the cast are certainly worth seeing, but if you have not seen this classic before, PLEASE watch the bare bones first edition DVD that does not have the ubercolor cover but the more black/blue/whitish cover with a large picture of Swan's (Michael Beck)face in the upper right...or search your movie section of cable and find it on Encore or IFC. Walter Hill...Shame on You! Do NOT watch The Directors Cut version if you have never seen this movie. Watch the original, then check out the extras on this disc if you feel the need.

The Original version cover looks like This:

It has action scenes that are of course fake but not extremely drawn out and over the top in other fighting based films.  The storyline was great and the outfits were even better.  I would definitely recommend this to someone who appreciates older movies and not ""how much CGI can I fit into 2hrs"" like we have today.",1380672000,,491,4.191489361702128

It sounded flatter, more mono like in the early crowd scenes, where I expected more surround sound(they couldn't possibly have two different audio versions?) - I eventually found I just had to turn the dials up more for the Blu-ray, and it matched. Flawless picture quality for a 1979 release; doesn't look dated at all. I remember just the poster for this in the theatre lobby intimating me as a 9-year in 1979; it was a time when urban crime and gangs were prevalent in the public's mind (it was the same era that gave us the Deathwish films, which gave the audience the revenge it craved for feeling intimated by criminals and gangs.) Only in the last few years did I understand the story was inspired by some famous Greek history - Anibasis by Xenophon, the famous retreat of Greek soldiers from deep in the Persian Empire - updated to a dystopian, future New York where gang culture has actually become a true alternative to a society with corrupt police and government officials (plus the influence of different mafia families.) One gang on a long retreat from a meeting in the Bronx - The Warriors, from Coney Island - are on a journey of both body and spirit, ultimately asking themselves is such a life worth it, and is there more beyond the horizon of the city they have always felt trapped in. A film both thrilling and unexpectedly thought provoking, and still the best film to date by Walter Hill (48 hrs. , Red Heat, Streets Of Fire)",1379116800,3,1571,4.594306049822064

When I would tell them, ""I've never seen it."" I was immediately met with disbelief and an immediate instruction, ""Oh GOD! You have got to see it! It's one of my favorite movies of all time."" Naturally I was very curious to find out what I'd been missing all these years.
I began watching and was sucked into a story about the biggest, baddest gangsta in NY ""Cyrus"" calling a meeting of ALL the gangs of NYC together. But instead of the intended uniting off everybody, the meeting disolves into chaos when someone in the crowd shoots & kills Cyrus in mid speech. The actual shooter points the finger at another gang, The Warriors, in an effort to shift blame off of himself and everybody believes him. So their is a bounty announced on the warriors' heads & every single gang in NYC is out to find and hurt them dead or alive. The movie details the fraut adventure The Warriors must face to make it back to their turf in Coney Island-while obviously having to passing thru all the other gang's territory. Can You Dig It?!
The clothing and gang names are awesome and entertaining. I think it is set in 1979 NYC- the movie is SO BAD that it's SO GOOD. U too will reference the movie and the dialogue after you have it loaded into your memory bank. It's immediatetly entertaining, gives u some laughs (although it's doubtful that it was the original intention of the director) & it's a great little time capsule. Definitely a great source for Halloween costume ideas.

235113,3,6300213714,"After watching this movie for the first time just now, it's hard for me to understand the hype.  Perhaps it was a big achievement at the time.  Not sure.  I found the story somewhat boring and predictable.

Starts with a massive gathering of gangs in New York (minus the mafia I guess) where the unofficial ""leader"" of all things gang related, Cyrus, is trying to convince all the gangs to unite for a common cause, to take over the streets of New York from the cops (good luck with that) and is then shot while giving this inspiring speech.

Everyone flees and one member of the Warriors sees the guy from another gang who did the shooting.  The culprit yells out that the warriors shot Cyrus.  The rest of the movie, gangs are chasing the Warriors for killing Cyrus because word on the street is that the Warriors killed Cyrus, yet it takes them a while to figure out why all these gangs are chasing them.  That's it.  I won't ""ruin"" the end but there's really not much going on.  Little dialogue and lot's of fight scenes and running from cops and other gangs.  Random ally chicks here and there, and somehow the Warriors pick up one along the way.  Odd.  She's really good looking and good at running with those high heels too!

Call me crazy, but if I figured out that everyone in town thinks my group shot ""Cyrus"" and that's why we keep getting chased and attacked by people we don't know when all we're doing is trying to go home and sleep... i'd probably take off those clothes we're wearing that make us look like a gang called ""the warriors.""  Guess they prefer battle scars, running and/or the thrill of people trying to kill them.  I suppose it might be difficult to find shirts in the middle of the night...

Memorable characters and often quoted lines throughout (I remember Shaquille O'Neal yelling ""Can You Dig It!"" to the fans. That didn't come from Shaq, it came from this movie). There's something in the way the Riffs leader Cyrus speaks that reminds me of Pres. Obama.

The gang is hounded by the likes of the Turnbull ACs, the Baseball Furies, and the Rogues, all colorful looks at an imagined urban underworld that again, could only have been inspired by the culture of the 1970s.

If they would have put both this version and the untouched original on the same DVD, a lot of grumping could have been avoided.

235318,5,6300213714,"Gritty 70's cinema rarely got this eventful. The Warriors became a small phenomenon during it's initial release. By today's standards the violence in the film seems rather tame, but in this period of the 70's some critics slammed the movie because of it's excessive violence, and for good reason. The film seemed to glorify the idea of gangs and being a member of one. Though obviously some of the gangs in this film seem like comic book characters, especially the 'baseball furies' who paint their faces, wear baseball uniforms and used baseball bats as weapons. With that inclusion alone there seems to be a little bit of a 'Clockwork Orange' influence to the movie. In the 70's this film seemed like the real thing none the less. The only people who knew gangs like this really didn't exist were real gang members back then. The film also did in fact influence some teenagers to emulate some of the characters in the film, and the film was blamed for a short outbreak of ""gang related"" violence. The film worked very well because director Walter Hill had a good vibe for the city. NY city made a great backdrop for a film like this. Gang fights in subway stations and central park by night highlight some exciting acton sequences. The audience get's to imagine what it would be like to be part of a street gang. This gang- falsely accused of murder and fighting their way 50 miles back to their turf. One outstanding thing about this film was James Remar(Cruising, What lies Beneath, Django Unchained) as the head-strong and tough warrior member, Ajax. He is hard to forget once you've seen him in this film. Michael Beck(Xanadu) makes the perfect gang leader.",1367884800,2,1663,4.718213058419244

The warriors struggled getting back to their town. They were accussed of something they never did. They were lied about. In the process they lost people. This happens in everyday life. Reputations are destroyed because of jealousy or simply because someone wants to look better than the other. This is usually is the result of greed or a quest for attention. But, in the end justice was served. The truth came out and the bad people paid the price. Sometimes we don't see justice served here on earth.

The plot is purely simple: When a charismatic gang leader is shot at an open air convention in the Bronx meant to unite all the gangs in New York City, a gang from Coney Island called the Warriors get blamed and have to fight back to their own turf--which means an escalating series of battles with colorful and improbable gangs like the the Turnbull ACs, the Orphans, the Baseball Furies, the Punks, and the Lizzies- learning from the latter that everyone believes they killed Cyrus. This is a story of young men, and one crazy girl caught up in urban violence by being in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Cyrus is killed during the speech, and the Warriors are framed forcing them to fight their way home. The Warriors is an iconic, adrenaline-filled brawler.

The Warriors has a straight-forward story; easy to follow and efficiently told. It moves at a consistent pace and blends brutal fistfight brawls, baseball bat duels, edge-of-your-seat chases, and more; basically, it has a great variety in action which keeps the movie going and avoids repetition. This is a film with plenty of memorable quotables; from ""Can you dig it?!?!?"" to ""Warriors, come out and play"", this film is unforgettable. The acting was good, the music was excellent, great cinematography and choreography for the fights.

Overall, The Warriors is an amazing action film. Definitely a must-watch for fans of film in general. As of 1/19/13, this film is available on Amazon Prime Instant Video and Netflix Streaming, a purchase is highly recommended.

235832,4,6300213714,"The new Warriors Director's Cut Blu Ray is an example of addition by subtraction.  They added some scenes that aided the story and others that detracted from the story.  The beginning with the reference to Anabasis is good, but needed to be fleshed out more to help the viewers understand the connection (to anyone who does not know, the Warriors is a modern retelling of the Greek classic, Anabasis).  While the comic panels detract from the story, they do not ruin it as others have said.  There are a few instances where they hurt the story a bit, the Baseball Furies scene and the end of the movie.  Otherwise, they are just an unnecessary addition.

While the changes will upset some people, the new transfer more than makes up for it.  Visually, the film has never looked better.  The colors are vibrant, the blacks deep and you will see details that were never present on the older versions.  Also, while the sound has not had a huge upgrade, it has been improved.  Now, you hear more of the conversations, especially during the big meeting and when they are fleeing the Lizzies.

The special features are nice as the original DVD version was bare bones.

The best case would have been to include both versions of the film on the Blu Ray.  But for the price, you can easily get this and the DVD version of the original film and have both to choose from.",1357257600,10,1360,4.524590163934426

This movie has some pretty good action and some parts that I thought were funny. Even though the movie was well written, and directed, I just can't get into a story about a bunch of street punks beating each other up for no good reason. If you someone is fighting for something important like family or country, I can get into that. This movie is just about thugs, and I really just don't care.

I especially like the Coney Island scenes, being an old Brooklyn boy. The movie drifts in and out conflicts with surrealistic gangs. The leader of the protagonist gang has has become a classic icon. The actor does a marvelous job portraying a sociopathic gang leader on the edge of psychotic behaviors.

However, instead of ancient Greek armies fighting their way to the Black Sea, the titular gang fights their way back to Coney Island in Brooklyn, taking on a slew of gangs from the corny to the fearsome.

Interestingly, Yurick hated the movie and thought the character of Cyrus was dreadful (hey, Stephen King hated The Shining too, which was a fantastic film so what do authors know?).

The film in undeniably cheesy (The Union Square subway roller skating gang?) but the opening sequence is wonderfully creepy and the settings are terrific as is the music.

Warrior gangster Ajax went on to become Dexter's flashback dad on that show and there are many snippets of memorable dialogue, including a radio DJ wishing the gang well as they try and fight their way home. ""Can you dig it?"" ""Warriors, come out to play-iy-ay"" became incorporated into 90s rap and the Furies gang were the inspiration for a video by Eminem.

236037,4,6300213714,"Just got my copy of ""The Warriors Director's Cut"". I'd read about the changes Walter Hill made, inserting comic-strip panels between some scenes, so I was as wary as anyone else.

I'm here to tell you that this addition in no way detracts from the movie. Walter Hill explains at the beginning that he considered The Warriors a kind of comic book-type story and that he might have done it that way if he'd thought of it back in '79.

And it's true: Certainly, ""The Warriors"" is a movie to enjoy but not to be taken too seriously. The comic insertions merely bring out the cartoonish flavor of the movie (consider this: those ""wipes"" between scenes were in the original movie, and the editor, in one of the commentaries, said they were used to signify a sort of switch between ""panels"" or pages).

Think about it: The Baseball Furies? The High Hats? You can't take these gangs seriously--though the Furies sure look cool. And even Michael ""Swan"" Beck comments about how, after their vicious fight with The Punks (in the bathroom), his character comes off with one gash on his face but otherwise looking fine. You have to take the movie as it is: a live-action comic book.

By doing so, I was able to enjoy the movie just as much. Everyone's entitled to their opinion, but don't let it sway you; especially the ones that make it sound like these insertions are everywhere and therefore ruin the movie. Absolutely untrue! The Warriors is still a classic.",1345939200,2,1450,4.63035019455253

236096,5,6300213714,"""The Warriors"" (1979) is perhaps the definitive cult film -- a flick you always enjoy seeing again.

The story involves a Coney Island gang that gets wrongly accused of murder and must make it back home from the Bronx, fighting enemy gangs and police all the way.

The 'feel' of the movie is part surreal, part realistic and wholly captivating!

""The Warriors"" is just a great flick full of memorable scenes and lines. I really love the ending where the remaining Warriors walk down the Coney Island beach while the DJ offers them a tribute song -- ""Survival In the City"" by Walsh/Eagles.

I also like the fact that the Warriors is a racially mixed gang -- a group of lost souls in the urban jungle, banded together perhaps for no other reason except for the obvious fact that they're from the same urban cesspool and have a need to belong.

I stated that the movie is part realistic, but only in the sense that it never becomes campy; the creators and cast properly take it all quite serious. Other than that, the flick showcases a mesmerizing fantastical New York City, that could never be mistaken for reality.",1337126400,,1113,4.601010101010101

Also, it sure seemed scary didn't it?

Therefore we have simplified and hopefully un-scaryfied it a bit by framing it into a comic book reality by adding word balloons and an awesome cgi comic intro.

Also, looking back we regret not having the technology to digitize Cyruss to a chinese man to avoid any similarities to Obama, who as we all know is a real person, not a pretend leader of a bunch of ruthless gang bangers.

I did have the opportunity to meet David Patrick Kelly (Luther) when he was in my town for a film festival. I sat in on an interview with him and he attended a showing of the director's cut where he took questions after the show. Kelly understands that there are strong feelings about the theatrical release but thinks that the director's cut is good in its own right and reinforced that it represents the director's vision. I figure if it is good enough for Kelly who is responsible for one of the best lines uttered in a film it is good enough for me.

For the record, I watched the theatrical release twice before seeing the director's cut for the first time. While I love the original version, the changes in the director's cut did not lessen that love for the film. I was still gripped, excited, and thrilled.",1331164800,3,940,4.465116279069767

The fact that it is not, nor was it ever intended to be, a realistic portrayal of gang life or activities seems to go over a lot of people's heads now as it did then. While I have my issues with this version of the movie as well, I suspect part of the reason it was done this way this time around was to try to remove it one step further from reality, to portray it as a comic book/graphic novel kind of experience, which takes away the need to suspend disbelief since it's all a fantasy, or 'some alternate reality', ala ""Streets of Fire"". Once you view it that way, what Hill did makes perfect sense. Whether or not that was his original vision, I'm not sure, perhaps he didn't have the means at the time, or he couldn't sell the story that way, in any case, it's important to remember that directors often don't get to present something exactly as they might want. If you try to view the film as a realistic depiction of gang life, you'll be disappointed, because it's not. Gangs are rarely integrated, gangs rarely brawl in the streets, and they certainly don't run around in baseball uniforms and makeup. If you view the film as a fantasy adventure, it stands the test of time very well...and isn't that really the attraction of cult films in the first place, that they are removed from reality?",1327363200,,1457,4.34065934065934

The future is ours...if you can count.

I have a small pile of unwatched Blu-rays, but last night I was in the mood for something I already knew. After much deliberation, I went with The Warriors.

I like to analyze why I enjoy certain movies so that I can understand myself more, but this one is tricky.

I know that I don't like watching violence or people getting beaten up, unless there's a point to it. I certainly don't think it's cool to watch a fight or someone being hurt. I have no fascination for gangs in general. The acting isn't up to much and dialogue is limited. I couldn't pick out a selection of scenes that were meaningful or memorable. So why do I enjoy watching this movie?

I do like the setting. Released in 1979, it was intended to have a somewhat futuristic look. It still seems dated to me though.

The first 15 minutes sets up the story so I don't think talking about it is much of a spoiler. The gangs are requested to attend a meeting by Cyrus, the leader of the biggest gang. Those attending are allowed to send nine members from their gang and weapons aren't allowed. Cyrus points out that members from rival gangs are standing together without anyone getting wasted. He also observes that there are 60,000 gang members in New York and only 20,000 police. Instead of fighting over a few yards of turf, the combined force could take over the city. That's an interesting idea. Unfortunately, gangs being what they are, one of the gang members (Kelly, Twin Peaks) hasn't obeyed the truce and shoots Cyrus, killing him. He points at the Warriors, claiming they did the shooting.

So the nine gang members are surrounded by rival gangs, weaponless, fifty miles from home. Both the police and the rival gangs are after them. The story shows what happens when they try to make it back to their home turf. Nine innocent men on the run; Hitchcock would be proud.

As I said, that's the first 15 minutes. The remainder of the story deals with the journey home. Will they all make it? Will any of them?

The soundtrack adds something and a local radio station monitors the progress of the Warriors. The original music by Barry De Vorzon fits in well and makes the whole thing an atmospheric experience.

Various encounters with other gangs and the police ensue. The gangs all have their own colors and way of doing things.

It's such a simple story, but it works. It's become something of a cult classic over the years in the same way that Escape From New York has.

I'm still not sure why I like it so much. Do I place myself in their position? Is it nostalgia for my childhood? Most of the characters are merely sketches, although some have a bit more depth. There are quiet periods where we just see the Warriors walking around, although the scenes are filled with tension because a threat could appear at any time.

After all that, I'm still not sure.

Would I recommend this? Sure. It's not what you would think just by looking at the title or the cover. If you can see it for free, it's worth checking out. Maybe you'll have the same reaction as me.

This is a surprisingly good transfer for a movie of its age and limited budget. The sound quality is a little lacking, being just DD 5.1.

Overall 4.5/5",1303689600,2,3529,4.573015873015873
236203,5,6300213714,"The Warriors. Oddly enough, it wasn't until 2005 that I knew this movie existed. And that was due to the Playstation 2 game based on the movie. Oddly enough, it wasn't until 2010 that I actually got around to seeing the movie.

Admittedly, I've never seen the theatrical version. Only this with the comic book cuts. So it didn't bother me as some people seem to be bothered.

That said, what is The Warriors? It should be noted that the movie is actually based on a book of the same name though there naturally were some changes (such as there being white gang members whereas in the book all the members were black or Latino). The plot was inspired by an ancient story that had a group of mercenaries trapped miles behind enemy lines trying to fight their way to safety.

That's the basic set up for the movie. At the beginning, New York City's largest gang, the Riffs, led by a man named Cyrus organizes a gathering of the city's main gangs and their representatives. His goal is to unite the gangs into one ""army"" to effectively take control of the city. Unfortunately, for both Cyrus and the Warriors, he is murdered and his death is blamed on the Warriors. With every gang in the city out to get them, the main characters have to fight their way home to Coney Island.

You might could say this is a standard through and through ""guy movie"" though that of course doesn't mean women can't enjoy it either.

It's a collective hero movie meaning there's no one central character. The acting is pretty decent. Oddly enough, it should also be noted that this movie was many of the main characters' only acting role if you don't count the game.

The action is also nice. The Warriors must face off with several rival gangs in the process of making it home. This includes being chased down in a van, fighting in a bathroom, and a car blowing up.

Do they succeed? Are their names cleared for the murder of Cyrus? Soldier up and find out, as the Warriors would tell you.

All in all, if you're looking for a decent action movie to watch on a Friday night, The Warriors is a good movie to start with.",1302825600,,2095,4.423376623376623

For those who complain that this new version emphases the cartoon nature of the movie, well Doh! If you want a realer deal on street gangs, read the book. The James Remar character - a favorite character actor of mine - comes closest. For example, Mercy asks the Warriors if they are planning to pull a train on her. In the movie, it's like ""Huh?"" In the book, it's ""All aboard!""

But then, who wants to see true to life violence. I will take the stylized cinema variety any day.

Director Walter Hill has seen fit to re-edit the film and introduce an overt comic book element by inserting freeze-frames and captions between the scenes which mimic the panels of an old-fashioned, four-colour pulp comic book. The effect of this is to completely destroy the pace and feel of one of the best, stylized, urban thrillers ever to be unleashed on an unsuspecting public. As a technique, it may work in the context of a schlock horror classic like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Creepshow-Snap-Case/dp/0790744295/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Creepshow (Snap Case)</a>&nbsp;(which was an affectionate, tongue-in-cheek pastiche of the old EC horror comics) but here it just sucks like you wouldn't believe.

Walter Hill's Ultimate Director's Cut is even better than the original with the comic book segues and the intro with Greek history analogy. It's appropriate since The Warriors has a classical feel; it's a perilous journey homeward to Coney Island. The Warriors  contains marvelous performances throughout, for me especially Michael Beck and Deborah Van Valkenburgh. Anyone remember her as the good girl daughter on Too Close for Comfort in the 1980s? The creativity in crafting gang appearances, especially the baseball furies, always cracks me up, and the Rogues' ranting ""Warriors come out to pay-eay"" is unnerving genius.

This is a masterpiece on many levels. Forget the criticism of the silly gangs. The cult aspect of the film's popularity would be lost without it. It could have been grittier, less comic-bookish, but that would have produced a different movie entirely, closer to Death Wish. I think this could be the quintessential American boy-girl story, also.

This modern (OK, modern for 1979) retelling of a Greek legend is amazing, as all the comic-book-come-to-life characters give the movie a gritty realism mixed with existentialism and a melancholy sadness, particularly at the end. A lot of die-hard fans complain about the Ultimate Director's Cut, but honestly it's not that bad, except for the fact that Walter Hill changed up the end scene too much (which is inexcusable). Otherwise, the comic-book style interludes don't take away from the movie (and yes I've seen the original). The Blu-Ray adaptation is awful because essentially all you're getting is 7.1 Surround (if you have a home theater system) and a marginally better picture: I watched this and the DVD version on a Pioneer Elite 60"" TV and didn't notice much of a difference. There are no real extra features and there doesn't appear to be any BD-Live content (though admittedly my Panasonic Blu-Ray player isn't hooked up to the Internet yet; I'm just saying I didn't see anything pertaining to BD-Live in the main menu). If you want The Warriors (and if you're a movie fan with a functioning brain, you will), save a couple of bucks and just get the DVD version. Can you dig it? CAN YOU DIG IT?!",1261353600,2,1378,4.818565400843882
236321,5,6300213714,"I can understand some of the complaints about the director's cut using campy comic book scenes in breaking up sections of the film - but as the Director states in the film - this version is closer to the novel and closer to to the director's vision.  The film is very accurate in portraying New York City gangs in the late 1970's - but the film's plot and portrayal crosses the line into a pure comic book world in several areas - hence I think the comic scenes are OK.

This is one trippy film. I was born in the 1970's in a lower middle class part of New York City and I can just remember gangs roaming around like the ones depicted in the film.  You can really see how the American diet has changed over the years because everyone in this film is skinny as a rail and lean.  You could not create a film now and recreate the 1970's anymore because even if you made up accurate film sets - americans really do not look the same anymore.  (Spike Lee did a good job in 'Summer of Sam' but its still not close).

I put this film on and I think of myself and my family over 30 years ago.  The film drags you in when the subway picks up the Warriors in Coney - seeing the old Wonder Wheel lit up - ahhh.  The music is great as the Warriors rocket through the subway tunnels up the Bronx and we hear the names of some great gangs like 'The Van Cortland Rangers' all dressed in camaflouge.  (Van Cortland park in the northern Bronx has large swaths of woods).  Back in the 1970's gangs still had some type of Honor Code and some education - for instance, the gang members uses the word 'conclave' to describe the meeting called by Cyrus.  Gangs were able to send emissary's into other gangs turf under truce to deliver information.  They use the term 'Parlay' in the film without explanation.  (In the movie 'Event Horizon' they actually have to explain that CO2 gas builds up when humans breeth!) - gangs had some education - now your typical gang member cant tie his shoes.

In any case - a rival gang member shoots Cyrus (for laughs) ""I like doing stuff like that"" and blames the Warriors for it.  The Warriors are then hunted by every gang in the City as they make their way back to Coney.  The police break up the meeting right after the shooting.  Cyrus' gang even uses coded language over a jazz radio station to tell everyone in the City to 'bring in' the warriors.  ""You better be looken' good Warriors - you better be looken real good - all the way back to Coney.""

The Warriros then fight off several gangs - ""we bop are way back.""  For instance, the 'Punks' who take a beat down in an old New York City subway bathroom.  (I remember those OMG!)  The 'Punks also all wear 4 wheel roller skates.  I can remember going to disco style rollar rinks as a kid!

I think that the people that appreciate this film the most are those who can remember and grew up in New York City circa 1973 to 1983.  The feel of this film, the locales, the way the old street lights used to look and the trippy music - it brings back a lot of memories.  Back then gangs were still ethnically made up but all gangs were more or less American.  There were also  'white gangs' not all made up of bikers, nazis, or kkk guys - the white gang just happened to all come from a 10 block area of a lower middle class neighborhood - the film traces an old New York City subway map as they goto the Bronx - they talk about making subway transfers along the way.  Been there - done that.

In reality, these gangs did tens of millions of dollars of property damage, dealt drugs, shook down businesses for protection money, etc. Incredibly - the film crew shooting the parts of this film in Coney Island paid protection money to the gang down there at the time.  When a payment was missed - film equipment was trashed.  Read online about the history of the film!

This film is part of my collection - its a window on my past and window on New York City's past, for good or ill.  Its a good story, albeit a yarn.  There were a lot of throw-away kids back then - there are now just a different kind.

Kudos to the Warriors!",1260057600,5,4087,4.214929214929215

I am guessing that the guy who wrote the screen play learned about NYC gangs by watching West Side Story.  He then added in some dialogue borrowed from some hippie films.  Right there, you know this is going to be cheesy.  Sadly, it was not cheesy good, it was cheesy bad.

The reason it was cheesy bad is because 1/2 of the film is footage of a bunch of Fame extras walking around NYC.  So while I appreciate the ""so bad it's good"" thing, any humor provided by the goofy dialogue was lost in the ensuing walking scenes.

236370,4,6300213714,"Walter Hill's THE WARRIORS was a remarkable film when it emerged in 1980. Based on Xenophon's legendary military tale ANABASIS, about a gang of soldiers cut off from their homeland and outnumbered on enemy turf, it retains a mythic atmosphere, and Hill admitted its rhythms and style were much based on comic books. (The film was apparently a favorite of President Reagan's, which may be an apocryphal fact but which makes perfect sense when you considering his own cinematic career.) Hill makes some terrific choices, including a kind of ""chorus"" part enacted by the great Lynn Thigpen (see only as a mouth in extreme close-up) as a radio DJ announcing the plans to attack the Warriors after they've been framed for murdering a legendary visionary gang leader. And the film genuinely has visual dazzle, with New York City figured as a hot graffiti-riddled neon wasteland inhabited almost solely by gangs and cops.

Even so, the film has unfortunately dated more than you'd think. The gangs (all gathered together in the Bronx in the film's beginning by the visionary, Cyrus) each have a distinctive look which every member in the gang wears, such as purple forties hats or (in the case of the titular heroes) red leather vests. This has the unintendedly humorous consequence of making the gangs all look like Olympic synchronized swimming teams, or like Seventies rock bands: in fact, in one of the film's most famous sequences, the Warriors face off against the Baseball Furies, a gang that wear baseball uniforms and full face make-up clearly inspired by KISS and Alice Cooper. (One of the film's few jokes is that the Baseball Furies turn out to be wimps; ""I should have guessed,"" one of the Warriors remarks after defeating them.) The presence of Michael Beck as Swan, the Warriors' de facto leader for most of the film, might remind you of his next film XANADU, which in its conclusion also featured groups of men and women in fabulous costumes also set against a musical background. (The by-and-large unthreatening gang members here look like they might easily have been re-outfitted to be the rollerskaters, muses, and pop-and-lock dancers from that later film.) Neither Beck nor his lady love, the luscious-lipped Deborah van Valkenburgh, are very gifted in their line readings, although they're both quite memorably beautiful--they might be style icons of the year 1980. You'll see instantly why this film has a confirmed cult status.",1243814400,,2444,5.019704433497537

236539,4,6300213714,"The Warriors (Walter Hill, 1979)

When I was a kid growing up in the seventies, there were three movies that defined all that was cool. Phantasm was (and still is) the essence of horror. Death Race 2000 was the epitome of the action comedy. And The Warriors was a textbook on how to make a darker action film. I watched it a few nights ago for the first time in twenty years or thereabouts, and while as an adult it's easier to see some of the shortcomings Walter Hill would develop as he gained experience, there's still no denying that The Warriors is, in fact, all that and a bag of chips.

This is not the New York City you know. The gangs to be found in Walter Hill's epic chase flick would probably be stomped into the ground in five seconds flat. All of them are far too fashion-conscious to actually survive on the streets. But in the context of the film, they look cool, and that's what counts. Once you have seen the Furies in action, you will never forget them-- Yankee uniforms, baseball bats, and very strangely painted faces. The Warriors themselves, reflecting upon seventies fashion from the safe distance of the next century, are almost inviting themselves to be beaten to a pulp; leather vests with no shirts? Oh, please. But somehow, it still works.

The plot: Cyrus (Roger Hill), the leader of the Riffs, the city's largest gang, calls a meeting at which nine representatives from each of the city's gangs will show up. The Warriors, from Coney Island, are one of those gangs. During the meeting, during which Cyrus preaches banding together and taking the city for their own, he is shot and killed by Luther (Dreamscape's David Patrick Kelly), one of the Rogues, who in the confusion is able to lay the blame at the feet of Cleon (Dorsey Wright), the Warriors' lead delegate. With the shooting, the all-city gang truce is off, leaving the eight remaining Warriors to make it all the way back across the five boroughs to their home turf. They have to cross the territory of seemingly every other gang in the city to do so, and to make matters worse, the Riffs are also looking for them. Just to add to the fun, there's tension in the ranks between Swan, the Warriors' warleader (Michael Beck), and an upstart, Ajax (James Remar), who believes he should be next in line to lead the gang to glorious times.

Yeah, it's pretty cheesy. But Hill pretties it up a good deal, and to be fair, when he's on his game, he's a great action film director. And Hill was certainly on his game here. Even the lulls in the action are fraught with tension, though one wonders on occasion whether they should be. Still, for all that, it's a very fun movie, and it does what it's supposed to do-- entertain the viewer for ninety minutes and change. How much more do you really need from an action film? ****",1201046400,2,2807,4.508840864440079

Once it hit Blu-ray, I finally put it in my rental queue to see what all the fuss was about. After my initial viewing, I just had to order a copy of my own immediately. I definitely know why this film is regarded as the cult classic as it is. Great characters and a simple, yet engaging story. A gang, wrongly accused of a crime, must fight ther way back home. No fancy effects, no silly one-liners. Just a group of guys going through a brutal fight to get to where they need to be. And visually? I don't know what the original DVD looked like, as Blu-ray is my only reference. But honestly, if you hadn't told me it was an older film, I would have guessed it was filmed this year, along with a really good costume design team.

236541,4,6300213714,"This ""Ultimate Director's Cut"" of ""The Warriors"" unashamedly emphasizes the comic book nature of the film.

Director Walter Hill goes out on a limb to create an alternative reality of gang culture - and succeeds brilliantly.

""The Warriors"" is somewhat influenced by Stanley Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" in styling but has a much lighter tone.

Acted with conviction by a large cast (no-one plays a weasally villain better than David Patrick Kelly), ""The Warriors"" makes brilliant use of New York street and subway locations.

Still holds up well after all these years because it stands outside contemporary concerns to explore the timeless themes of survival against the odds and ultimate redemption.

236542,4,6300213714,"As a big fan of this movie, I was stoked about it being re-released, along with the game, in a new Director's Cut version. First, the good. The Warriors is simply a great movie with a 70's New York vibe like no other. The performances are solid, the action is fast paced, and during the run back to Coney Island you really get a sense of fight AND flight.
Now, the bad. Although for the most part, I liked the idea of the comic book angle. After all, some of the gangs in The Warriors are straight out of the comic book genre. However, in one particular scene, they took it too far and edited one of the most powerful scenes in the movie. As four members of The Warriors escape the police from a subway station and race to the streets, they are confronted by The Baseball Furies. In the original version, they get to the streets, Ajax shouts ""Where are they?!"" in reference to the other members of The Warriors they were just with, and immediately after he says this, his eyes turn stone cold as he and the others spot The Baseball Furies, standing in the distance, waiting for The Warriors, wielding their weapon of choice, the baseball bat. So it goes from intense, to a fierce intense scene of a never ending battle. In the Director's Cut, this scene is chopped up and all the intensity of this pivotal scene goes down the toilet when Ajax says ""Where are they?!"", he dissolved into a comic book sketching, and they cut to another scene. This was one of, if not the, best scenes in the movie and they butchered it. The movie itself is still great, but I'll never, ever understand why they did that with that particular scene.",1190073600,10,1628,4.394039735099338
236543,4,6300213714,"One of Walter Hill's best received and most controversial films gets a new look here in the ""Director's Cut.""  The biggest difference is the comic book transitions in which scenes freeze to comic book form before moving on.  The concept feels a little gimmicky and does distract early on, but once you're used to it, it accentuates some cool moments that make you smile.

The Warriors came out admist a lot of controversy.  During the first week of release, some knuckleheads back east decided to start shooting each other in a screening, creating the type of buzz you don't see anymore.  People were warned not to go see it.  Well, the movie never lived up to that hype.  It's a fairly conventional action-thriller.  What it did live up to was entertainment value.  Even decades after its release, there are still iconic moments that register in everything from pop culture references to songs.  Yes, the film is dated.  Some of the actors and dialogue are weak (surprisingly from Hill).  But the thematic story still holds true.  The action is still entertaining.  And the bad guy, clinking his bottles to the tune of ""War-r-r-r-riors...come out to pl-la-ay!!!"" will always have a special place in my heart.

HD transfer gives the film a freshness not seen in some time.  Extras are pretty scant, but at the price, this is a no-brainer to add to the library.",1188345600,2,1360,4.772532188841201
236544,3,6300213714,"I still think this movie is a classic, but allowing the director to change his vision 20-some years down the line resulted in a movie that is less than the original. The comic book scene transitions are jarring and yank you right out of the movie. Maybe this really is the movie he intended to make originally. I'm sure that if I'd seen this movie back then I would still have been impressed, but having seen the original cut I'm less than fond of the Ultimate Director's Cut. Luckily I still have my memories (and original DVD).

That said, the picture quality of this disc is obviously head-and-shoulders above that early DVD. I'm just afraid that the only time it'll be taken out of the cabinet and shown is when I want to rant about the disservice that was done to the movie by releasing this cut.

The bad part is, this ""director's cut"" sucks!  They claim it was how he originally wanted it to be, but if that were true, he could have done it!  There were no technology restrictions back then!  All he did was butcher this film in an attempt to try an modernize it and make it look 'cool' for the young people of today while completely forgetting about those who grew up with the film!

This comic book transistions BS is a distraction while watching.  It makes it look silly.  I know the film on a whole (the gangs) look silly now, but you can deal with that on it's own without them trying to make it look as if they made it look silly on purpose.  Also, many songs in the film run a lot longer and overlap dialog that was previously there!  This is also distracting and takes away some of the suspense.  They even totally edited out the end 'walk on the beach scene' and replaced it with a static comic strip!  That alone ruined this 'cut.'  That scene said alot.  It represented the end, the end as in the Warriors are presumably going home and the end of the movie.  It is also the memorable scene I recall of cabel all those years ago.  These cuts were almost as bad as the Star Wars DVD's!

What they should do is to in clude the original intro which truly sets up the story.  Forget that it took place in the daylight!  They should alos include all deleted scens to give in some length and GET RID OF THE COMIC BOOK BS!

The sound is horrible!  That is, the Dolby Digital.  The center channel(dialog) disappears and the channels get crossed.  You end up not being able to watch it in surround sound!  I hope it is not my amp, but I have not had a problem up to this point.  This sound is hard to deal with.  If the channels were correct, it would be fine.

236596,3,6300213714,"I'm shocked that a film that was made in 1979 still looks brand new today. High Definition certainly does this film justice. But also, so many films these days rely heavily on special effects, and The Warriors doesn't. Yes, it involves a lot of running, but it's very simplistic, and that makes it stand out from films today.

Can you imagine if some idiot director came along, and decided it was high time for this to have a remake? I reckon it would awful.

I knew nothing about The Warriors before watching it, and was gripped from the beginning. I loved the fact that in this director's cut, the new intro is included (bit of history for you guys out there) and the comic book effects (outlines at the beginning & end of scenes - sorry, I don't know the technical term for it) are excellent, and add a certain something to the movie.

Basically the movie is all about a group of gangs. I'm sorry, let me rephrase that - a BIG group of gangs, one of which gets accused of killing the big main man, who wanted to unite all the gangs. So all the other gangs are trying to get their revenge, and chase the main gang (funnily enough, called The Warriors) back to their turf. Where they can't touch them. There's probably well over 100 gangs in this, from all five points from New York, and each has their own 'turf'. Go into a rival's turf and you would expect not to walk another step. It's like in Scotland these days, you're not allowed to wear football strips into certain pubs. Honestly. Some of the gangs are featured in the film and some are not. My favourite was the Baseball Furies, mainly cos they scared me so much! All the gangs listed are: Alleycats, Amsterdam All-Stars, Baseball Furies, Black Hands, Blackjacks, Big Trains, Boppers, Boyle Avenue Runners, Charlemagnes, Colt 45's, Dealers, Delaney Rovers, Dingos, E Street Shufflers, Easy Aces, Electric Eliminators, Eighth Avenue Apaches, Fastballs, Fifth Street Bombers, Filmores, Firetasters, Five Points, Gerrards, Gladiators, Go Hards, Gun Hill Dancers, Gramercy Riffs, High Hats, High Rollers, Homeboys, Hoplites, Howitzers, Huks, Hurricanes, Imps, Jesters, Jones Street Boys, Judas Bunch, Jupiters, Knockdowns, Knuckles, Lizzies, Locos, Magicians, Meatpackers, Moonrunners, Napoleons, Nickel Steaks, Nightriders, Ninth Avenue Razors, Orphans, Panzers, Phillies, Plainsmen, Punks, Queen's Bridge Mutilators, Real Boys, Red Hook Shooters, Roadmasters, Rogues, Romans, Runaways, Saracens, Saratogas, Savage Huns, Shanghai Sultans, Southern Cross, Speedwagons, Stevedores, Stilletos, Stonebreakers, Terriers, Turks,  Turnbull AC's, Van Cortlandt Rangers, Warriors, Whispers, Xenophones, Xylophones, Yo-Yo's, Youngbloods, Zodiacs, and finally, the Zulus.

My main quibble about this movie is how none of the stars went on to bigger & better things. Michael Beck (Swan) particularly. At first he reminded me of someone, but I've figured out that to me, he looks like a mixture of Peter Green, young Keanu Reeves & Johnny Depp. It's the whole chiselled cheekbones and strong jawline. Hubba hubba. I'm a sucker for those. He could have done so well in the movie world, but he just seemed to disappear without a trace, according to his IMDB profile.

The other good thing about The Warriors, is the amount of running the actors have to do. Read here VERY FIT!!! And the actual Warriors seem to be mostly topless apart from a waistcoat. Guess the other reviewers didn't pick up on that. It must have been exhausting to film.

I would definitely recommend The Warriors as it seems to be a small cult classic, according to some reviewers. It's worthwhile picking up, and enjoying some simplistic film making.",1186012800,3,3666,5.079734219269103
236597,4,6300213714,"Bret Fetzer hits the nail in his review: the comic book transitions added by Walter Hill seems to overkill the movie. That's the only reason I rated it whith four stars instead of five.
The warriors is not a masterpice, but triumphs over its limitations. The premise is timeless: a group of (literally) warriors is unjustly acused of a murder and forced to fight its way back home against overwhelming forces. Some details of the film are cheesy, but it has style, and the over-the-top costumes and makeup plays ultimately in its favor, not bounding it to any particular period.
This HD DVD edition is very good. The transfer is flowless, with excelente constrast and wonderful colors. There are four interesting featurettes on the movie. What impresed me most was the interviews with cinematographer Andrew Laszlo. He details all the problems they faced shooting by night in locations, and one just wonders at his skill and artistic sense (the problem of the unpredictably summer rain in New York turns an ally at the end, because it was the perfect excuse to spread water over the pavement and thus reflect street ligths and make even richer the colors on the frame).

236601,4,6300213714,"Nine delegates from every gang from every neighbourhood across New York meet in an empty stadium to hear a speech on taking control of the city from a messianic and enigmatic overlord known as Cyrus.

The Warriors: Cleon, Swan, Ajax, Vermin, Cochise, Snow, Cowboy, Fox and Rembrandt travel all the way from Coney Island to be a part of this massive gathering with dozens of other rival gangs. Things go very, very wrong!

As you are probably aware, so called ""unseen editions"" and ""extended editions"" are pretty common on DVD and are usually lousy films with some extra filler thrown in to fool unsuspecting buyers. This is not the case with The Warriors. Like Daredevil or Aliens, this is one of those ""director's cuts"" that really makes a difference.

First and foremost are the comic book transitions and the new opening. Writer/director Walter Hill felt that his original presentation of the film was a little lost on the audience of the time and its subsequent cult status on video. This new cut draws parallels with the 4th century BC legend of Anabasis, in which an army of Greek mercenaries are left stranded after their leader Cyrus the Younger has been killed. If they can make it through 1000 miles of hostile territory to the ocean, they will be safe.

The Warriors, as you know, must make it through all the tough neighbourhoods of NY to Coney Island after they are wrongfully blamed for the assassination of mega-gang boss Cyrus. A loose, but truly inspired connection.

Back in the Seventies, there weren't just certain neighbourhoods in New York that you avoided. The whole damn city was infested with crime and scum. The gangs were plentiful and they really did OWN the streets. The scenario of all gangs joining together to form one big Uber-gang may seem far fetched today, but if Mayor Giuliani had left the city to decay then NY's future might well have ended up this way. But the fact that the Big Apple is a helluva lot safer these days doesn't lessen the overall impact of The Warriors.

As I mentioned, the Greek history inspiration is clever. But the film is also based on a Fifties novel by Sol Yurick and director Hill took a comic book approach to bring it to life. He was aware of the film's silliness, but coupled with the sense of adventure and episodic battles, a pulp fiction take could make it seem believable. For all we know, maybe there was a gang called The Baseball Furies, who went about with painted faces, beating invaders to a pulp. These were wild times.

The Director's Cut also makes the photography and editing more apparent. Hill frames the movie to look like comic book panels and, as usual, Freeman Davies' (Hill's favourite editor) cutting gives The Warriors a sleek and fast-paced look.

Hill is an action director of considerable talent, who is often overlooked. Films such as 48 Hours (and it's under-rated sequel), Southern Comfort, Trespass and Last Man Standing have never been massive hits, so his hardcore style is only familiar to fans of his work, rather than general movie audiences. Which is a shame!

Now is the time to rediscover The Warriors and be reintroduced to a cult classic. I know a lot of people are purists and will decry the Director's Cut as a cheap stunt to make more money, but I honestly think it's the superior, definitive version.

Judge for yourself; you might just agree with me.

The HD-DVD features a brilliant 1.85:1 1080p picture that is so clean and colorful you'll think that the film is just fresh out of the cinemas and not 28 years old. Ditto for the sound. Originally a plain stereo movie, the DVD comes with a remastered Dolby Digital Plus sound design and it's amazing. The songs come through loud and full of life and the dialogue natural. The sound effects were never that sophisticated, but there's loads of ambience to be had and you'll still be surprised at how good the movie sounds without ever seeming artificial. A decent amount of extras are also included.",1183680000,2,3963,4.720694645441389
236602,5,6300213714,"THE WARRIORS. Now that is one of the coolest titles ever for a film. You really don't need anymore than that. It just works.

This film tells the tale of a street gang, wrongly accused of murder, having to fight their way back to their home turf. That's the whole film. You would never think that this simple premise could fill a 97 minute movie's running time, but it does, and does so well.

I loved this film from the first time that I saw it. It was, in fact, the very first film I ever saw on VHS (waaay back when). It seem somehow fitting that I should be writing a review of the Hi-Def.

THE WARRIORS' simple plot is full of great visuals and good fight sequences, well executed (but slightly dated) synth music and a sense of fun that keeps you watching to the end.  Who could forget the freakish BASEBALL FURIES when you first see them? By the end of the film you feel every bruise, cut and scrape that they have endured through their long night, and you want the baddies to 'get theirs' totally. The actor who played the rival gang's leader (THE ROGUES) was really creepy.

236604,3,6300213714,"WARRIORS (1979) is a quintessential late 1970's movie partly in from

the automobiles shown, the debilitated housing and neighborhoods

specifically chosen,  and the cheesy 70's era hard rock soundtrack.

Its strength is that it touches on  the basic survival and

self-preservation instincts that people  have when in danger. Some

may have come to recognize this as fear, and the reaction that ensues

in varying degrees. Those in the military know this well, in combat,

for example.

The story stresses the need for physical fitness (running, jogging,

weight lifting) and excellence in one-to-one hand combat to properly

engage opposing gangs. At the time, this did not encompass gun powder

weaponry, as the arms perhaps were difficult to obtain, and the minds

of the gangs did not see a need for mortality, but rather, ""just""

baseball bats, switch blades, molotov cocktails, physical brutality,

arson of vehicles, subway stations, etc.

Above all, what works most, is the amusement and the reaction to a

host of ridiculous scenarios, such as a policewoman working

undercover in a park, looking to actively entrap johns or rapists.

Other examples are the fashion or clothing selections of some gangs

(purple vests anyone?), or even the intro that suggests this plot

being on the same level as the ancient wars told by Homer in respect

of the Greeks and Trojans before the Roman Empire.

The formation of gangs is not entirely unrealistic, in some respects,

as they are often built by ethnicity, with the Warriors being the

sole exception.

The plot is reasonable, starting with a jamboree of sorts attempting

to get various gangs to unite together, for profit maximization of

their untold activities, with the except of a gang of anarchists.

The role of the police is well presented, as they are shown as being

effective, against literally dozens of platoons of thugs, mainly

comprised of youths who seem to have unlimited amounts of free time

on their hands, mainly in the evenings and at night, in the public

transportation systems of NYC and streets.

Amusingly, but unrealistically, a Radio DJ comes on from time to

time, with her score sheet (as if assisting to a boxing match), to

provide the listeners with the latest on the gang strife. (This is

the same actress that shows up in Enzo Castellari's movie, as a gang

leader of stylish dancers in New Barbarians.)

With NYC's dark underbelly (neighborhoods) exposed, it  brings into

focus the territorial limits, that gangs feel should not be crossed

by opposing ones, as a matter of pride and of economic control.

Although this DVD is not a true wide-screen release, it does not

distract at all from the action. The filming is good, sharp and good

quality, well edited, if not for the erroneous artistic choice of

using cartoons in between scenes, unfortunately, which takes the

audience out of their surreal experience.

The eye-candy of Deborah Van Valkenburgh obviously works well, as a

contrast to the bleak subway scenes, and to the combat and action

scenes, yet, implausible in her eagerness to forego her own gang and

join Swan.

In sum, Warriors is obviously a popular movie among a segment of the

population, above all, those below 15 or 21, or those in high

schools, owing to the interaction and interplay between gangs and

within the gangs, that is one-on-one, consistently, which makes the

action personal to the audience, never anonymous, impersonal, or

inconsequential. In 2007, the music is a liability, as it has no hip

hop or other styles that were invented and now dominate radio.",1180569600,,3599,4.98984771573604

One gang leader calls on all the rival gangs to set aside their turf battles and unite against the police force.  During his eloquent raised-platform speech in the opening sequence of the movie, a drugged-up street punk assassinates him, and points the blame at The Warriors, our hero street gang.  A melee ensures, and the Warriors need to make it home to Coney Island without getting assaulted by the cops or their rivals.

There isn't much else to the plot of this movie (in fact, the viewer is never sure of the assassin's motivations, other than surmising that he's a punk who has nothing better to do than cause trouble).  Visually, however, The Warriors is a cinematic experience.  Each gang is color coded in their own street uniform--baseball gear with face paint, denim overalls, purple satin with matching hats, a mime group, and so on.  The Warriors is representative of a video game a full decade before the explosion of video games (and it was recently turned into a video game by Rockstar Games).  The various teams are color coded, they get power ups and additional weapons by battling their enemies, and they need to complete a quest without getting killed by the enemy.

Swan (Michael Beck), the cool headed 'war chief,' assumes command... Of his followers only Ajax (James Remar) gives him trouble...

Their perilous journey home is filled with considerable amount of risks as they face violent encounters with different gangs in many shapes and colors...

'The Warriors' is a film that will make most viewers cringe at times, but you'll forgive the shortcomings and praise the exciting camera-work, the excellent use of music, and the good performance of David Patrick Kelly, the best soft-spoken killer since Andy Robinson in ""Dirty Harry.""

The great moment in the movie is when Patrick Kelly, clicking together three soda bottles, coaxes the Warriors out of hiding by whining over and over, ""Warriors, come out and play!""",1168905600,,2188,5.100840336134453

This classic movie set against the background of the Bronx, NYC and Brooklyn is a cult classic for a reason, it is great.  Many discuss the allusion to Homer's Odyssey but frankly I could care less, it's just great fun.  I strongly recommend that you buy it before MTV screws it up with a remake (in the works but hotly protested by fans).

236707,5,6300213714,"Totally awesome movie.  One of my favorite cult movies.  Reminds me of when I first saw it, I was blown away with the whole honor concept that was somehow evident in some of the ""honorable"" gangs at that time, and which is plainly evident in this film.  The ""honor & loyalty"" concept is incorporated in many of the modern movies that have been and are being made.  Sadly, in real life, such a concept is becoming more outdated and obsolete.  Many expect it but even fewer practice it.  In any regard, I value my copy because of it and it's just a really, really cool movie.  The best part of owning my own videos/DVDs, like the ""The Warriors"" is that I can see them anytime I'm in the mood or I'm disillusioned with many of the modern trends that take away from an individual's humanity. It helps remind me that there are still people who value the practice of  honorable concepts like myself.  I treasure the friendship of these rare individuals whenever I come across them.  Thanks for allowing me this forum in which I can express my viewpoint about such a great movie.",1162771200,2,1072,4.479381443298969
236708,5,6300213714,"The movie opens with an illustrated prologue such as found in the extended version of Dune. The narration tells the story of an army of Greek soldiers two thousand years ago that found themselves trapped one thousand miles from safety in the middle of the Persian Empire. This sets up the film as a story about soldiers running the gauntlet in a desperate effort to get back home to safety with everyone around them an enemy. The setting is a dark near-future; New York City where the streets controlled by rival street gangs. The Warriors is one such street gang from Coney Island that journey along with hundreds of other gangs for a large meeting in the Bronx. The Warriors, unarmed and out-numbered, are framed for a murder of major gang figure, and are forced to run back to Coney Island with every gang and cop in the city looking for them.

The transfer is gorgeous. On a standard definition TV screen, the film looks very modern, and the colors are saturated nicely. The audio is just as good. Having lived near an elevated rail line, the sounds of the subway system are authentic. The 70s rock music that powers the film does more than just sound good, it helps set the pace of the story. This is the definitive version of the cult classic that director Walter Hill intended. The film comes with several featurettes as well as an introduction by Walter Hill himself. There is English 5.1 and 2.0 audio tracks as well as a French audio track.

There is no commentary track. I wish there were; however, Walter Hill explains in his introduction that he feels that a film should speak for themselves without special explanations or apologies. I personally love commentary tracks when done by the director or core actors, but in The Warriors, the lack of a commentary track forces the viewer to only see the movie as it is. The viewer isn't allowed to see the world outside the film. For a film as dramatic as The Warriors this works very well. What Walter Hill adds to this version of the film are comic-book art style segways that bring the film back in line with the comic book origins he intended.",1154217600,2,2105,4.5809018567639255

Waites, Terry Michos and Tom Mckitterneck). However, our heroes are running from the cops and other rival gangs such as ""The Baseball Furies"" for they must run to their turf at the other side of the city, try to clear their names and fight Luther's gang.

Kickass action drama from director Walter Hill (""48 Hours"") is one of the most unique and violent films from the 70's! the premise is very original with terrific action & battle scenes with good performances. The movie has went on to become one of the controversial movies ever cause of it's subject matter and causing some violence to be break out into theaters, it's grown to become a cult classic over the years since it was released and i can see why.

This new Director's Cut DVD features an all-new version with a new narration, some comic book-esque framing at some points of the film and the ending, four featurettes, the original theatrical trailer and a deleted scene along with great picture and sound remastering.

While watched it then I was thinking that its from an ancient Greek story. I was pleased now when I saw the comic introduction that I was right.

What this movie proves that to make a really good movie, you don't need a massive budget and big name actors. They help but they are not necessary. The story, acting, directing, music, filming etc etc etc are all first rate.

A warning if you don't like these surreal comic type movies, you will not like it as its certainly not a realistic story. Also I wish that they had included the original theatrical release on this DVD as I thought that it was better then this version.

236714,5,6300213714,"Walter Hill's 1979 cult classic still holds up all these years later.  The Warriors is one of those films that one just has to see to believe, and while this new director's cut adds comic book-ish frames between scenes that don't really add anything to the film, they don't distract from it either.  Based on a mythical story from Greek history about soldiers trapped behind enemy lines, the Warriors are a New York street gang wrongfully blamed for the murder of a charismatic gang leader who wanted to unite all the gangs of the city.  As they try to make their way back to Coney Island, they are trailed and hunted by every gang in the city, and some won't make it back alive.  Though in some spots the film hasn't aged entirely well, the Warriors still manages to pack a punch (literally) and remains one of the best cult films to come out of the late 70's.  The DVD itself features some nifty featurettes with looks back on the film by Hill and stars Michael Beck and James Remar (who played Swan and Ajax respectively) among others, and there's even a clip for the great video game by Rockstar, which is definitely recommended for anyone who is a fan of the film.",1148774400,2,1169,4.469483568075117

Worse, the pauses they inject tend to trash the movie's rhythym.

I own both the original and Ultimate Director's Cut, and I'd say if you're a pathetic completist (like I am) then owning both is similarly a no-brainer.

However, this is the Director's Cut (so I'm assuming that means you get extra scenes, etc.). Without knowing the original version, I couldn't tell you what's different about it. This version of the movie is only about 95 minutes long.

The Warriors was filmed back in 1979 and tells the story of a street gang from Coney Island (""The Warriors"") that spend a night fleeing from every other gang in the city. There are lots of memorable one-liners, gang costumes, and characters.

The film is based on a novel that told the story of Greek warriors trapped in Persia that had to fight their way back to their homeland. In the opening minutes of the movie, they explain this, and say: ""this is a story about courage"" (or something like that, to paraphrase).

I bought this movie because it was relatively well-reviewed (see Rotten Tomatoes). I can see why. It was sort of a cross between a Broadway play and an old-school fight movie. While you don't get the action-per-second and super duper special effects of a modern movie, it was a breath of fresh air to see a film like this. It sort of took me back in time.

You should pass on this film if you're expecting something modern and flashy. If you appreciate the Greek analogy, and you want to see a stylistic portrayal of late 70s urban heroes, then you'll want to give this one a try.",1143072000,,1562,4.4475524475524475

Well... I think it's worth asking--did The Warriors *want* to be realistic? The movie, for example, has a gang of mimes.

Mimes.

I think it's safe to say that the film's creators weren't going for a ""realistic"" story. So, as for the ""plot holes"" one of the current spotlight reviewers talks about (like, why they didn't just call a cab or something like that), I think it's safe to dispense with that kind of talk. They don't call a cab because the story is about The Warriors fighting their way home through the streets of New York. That's why.

And, it's a fun story. There's a little bit in the beginning about the story of The Warriors modeling an ancient Greek event. I don't doubt it was the inspiration, but you won't find much that's 'deep' here. The Warriors is just a little bit of 70's campy fun, in the same sort of vein as Death Race 2000 or The Phantom of the Paradise, and there's nothing wrong with that.

I think they should've left the comic book theatrics out of it. Let's just pretend you hadn't seen it in the 27 years it's been released. If that was the case, then you got cheated with this version because Walter Hill took a serious movie about gang wars, courage and survival, and dumbed it down with comic book theatrics (as if there aren't enough comic book movies). Call me a sucker, but I just didn't want them to change a thing. I grew up watching this movie, and I still love it 25 years later to this day. This movie is about ""The Warriors"" (a street gang) trying all night to survive making it from the Bronx to Coney Island after they are wrongly accused of gunning down the president of ""The Gramacy Riffs""... Cyrus. On a good note, Micheal Beck (Swan) and James Remar (Ajax) still deliver powerhouse performances. Come on, we all know that Ajax (the 2nd best character of the movie) was robbed! In fact, Ajax and Swan were my 2 favorite characters in the whole entire movie, and halfway through it, Ajax gets arrested, and you don't see him anymore from that point on. If Walter Hill wanted to add something, he should've added a prison break. Just kidding! I really did miss my Ajax, and I would've loved to see him still standing tall at the end next to Swan. At any rate, I don't think that Deborah Van Valkenburgh was right for the part of Mercy, but that's just an opinion. David Patrick Kelly also didn't disappoint as the leader of ""The Rogues"" the real person who pulled the trigger killing Cyrus. At any rate, this movie was so ahead of it's time.

but im not saying the comic approach is bad!!!  i think i understand why Hill wanted to do this..

well there are a couple possible reasons, maybe he's trying to fit it into a more modern comic-book-trendy style.. maybe he really did indeed intend the movie to be comic bookish to begin with as he says.. or maybe it is just marketing.

well the new dvd release does coincide suspiciously with the rockstar game :)

but you know what, this is bad and good..

because to someone who isn't upset by the .. err . .  modification..  of their original beloved Warriors movie.. it makes an interestinglyh different movie!.. so if you have both versions, you can have the original and the strangely comic-bookized version..

a problem though, im thinking a new generation of kids/young adults will see this movie, and think that is the way it was .. not seeing the beauty of the original version . .  especially the leagues of video-gamers it will probably draw in this time..

the worst of all really...  the ending : (

in the original untainted Warriors.. that isn't trying to cleverly repackage itself or mutate to market itself to new genres/trendiness..  the ending beach scene.. where the Warriors (or the remaining warriors at this point) all go walking away along coney island beach . .  for a very long while to the background while the credits are rolling..

this was such a beautiful scene, maybe even my favorite of the film : D  that i almost cried when i saw it on television : D

i know, call me tacky or whatever but it had such a wonderful aeshetic/poeticness to it . .  i was a loner at the time and it made me really want to join them, be part of the warriors/belong.. well this isn't a psychology thesis, so on with the review..

and that was the worst shock last night as i watched this dvd release the first time.. they totally cut that for a stillframe of the comic frames.. and i knew right then and there 'this is a crime!!'  to the throngs of newcomers who will not even know the full beauty of the movie when they get this dvd..

but like i say, if you can find the original, good, this one is good in its own way if you don't mind it being kind of mocked into the comic form..

i think the only reason, frankly, they added the comic parts, were so they could even release it again and call it a directors cut..

but i see lots of reviewers slamming Hill for the comic book thing.. its not really BAD !  in itself.. it is a cool idea really.. but i was shocked that they would totally change it like that..

less shocking would have been if they actually just re-colorized or hyped up the visual to make it trendier ..

with some sort of image program trickery, etc. .. to make it seem almost like a different movie.. well i don't know maybe thats a dumb idea..

and yes, it ruined the beginning of the baseball fury encounter i thought..  i mean he pops on in a comic frame before you even have a chance to think 'hey where are we oh no who are these guys!!'

a great movie!! by the way ..  yes it can be cheesy, tacky.. and i even caught some mediocre acting this time around..

as i keep seeing this movie years after the last time i saw it..

and seeing it in a slightly different way..

and FULL of plot holes.. yes..

and oh god...  much like a horror movie... they keep splitting up??

my remote is broken so i cant access the featurettes yet : (

but im looking forward to it, especially with the interviews with the original cast members..

i was about to say im surprised an outright re-make of this movie hasn't been attempted yet.. the time seems ripe for it.. but i just found out that they are indeed looking to make one in 2006 . .  i was a small-time actor/model wannabe for a while, oh man what i wouldnt do to be in the remake of the Warriors..

well thats all i have to say i guess, it is a great movie and though the comics cut into it, its still here on this dvd . .

236832,4,6300213714,"The other reviews cover what the movie is about, so i'll spare that since you probably already know the summary.  You're probably reading this board for the same reason I did:  To find out which version is worth it to buy.

Here's the news:

If you're a hardcore fan of this movie and remember it as a part of your childhood, it's highly unlikely that you'll like the ""Ultimate Director's Cut"".  Some scenes from the original movie were chopped up and cut out.  The main thing that seperates this version from the previous dvd release is the inclusion of comic strip scenes.  You'll be watching the movie and all of a sudden the character on screen pauses, turns into a comic drawing, then the camera moves to another section of 'the page' with a letterboxed caption - 'meanwhile'.

This is where the early fans seem to dislike the dvd because it takes away from the gritty, vintage, feel of the movie.  The beginning of the feature has a comic intro that parallels this story to the Greek tragedy that inspired it.  Aside from this, the comics really don't contribute to the story nor the film.  If segments like the first were intergrated throughout the movie, it would definitely cause larger damage to the continuity that already affects this film with the comic digresssions as they are.

But if you have little to no patience for 70's movies, or kinda remember this movie, but not really, then you might like this dvd version of it.  What helps is that the movie is enhanced from the original, and looks alot cleaner than its earlier counterpart.  The documentaries provide valuable insight as to how this film was made and came together, the origins of the story, and how the actors look now.  Throw in the 5.1 dolby sound, and it makes for a worthwhile dvd.  But there is no substitute for the original.  They could have added the enhanced sound and picture plus documentaries to the film as it were, and it would have been ten times better.

SPOILERS:

For those who have seen this dvd, here are my own thoughts on the special features;

I don't know if any of you were annoyed at this, but I would have liked to see a ""play all"" option on the documentary menu.  It was a little irritating to keep playing each section after every 14 minutes or so.  Sometimes you just want to have it on and do other stuff.  Not a big thing, but it's funny when you think of how the comics disturb the continuity of the film and how even the special features suffer this fate!  I also didn't like the near-mandatory adds that appear in the beginning.  I get the ad for the video game version of this movie, but it provides an unnecessary inconvenience.  Not to be lazy, but losing yourself in a dvd is where we escape the little technicalites of life.  This is why we watch our movies right?  Sorry, i'll move on before this becomes a Seinfeld bit...

David Patrick Kelly is the MAN!!!  It's hilarious because all the other actors look so different (as expected given the age of the film).  If you could look at this movie and picure his character as an older gentleman, he looks exactly as you would picture him!  And he still has that squirmy, creepy voice!  I remember watching the documentary for the first time, uncertain if the entire ensemble would be back, and anxiously awaiting to hear his two cents, and then out of nowhere, you hear him speak.  Priceless.  He does his infamous saying again when he explains how he came up with the taunt - and it was golden!

I liked how all the actors seemed so enthused about this movie.  It may be seen as pathetic, and that's why many actors try to downplay their parts, but i'd rather see them proud and happy about it rather than act like a-holes.  David Harris and Deborah Van Valkenburgh in particular seem very genuine in their recollections.

I've seen how Walter Hill has drawn comparisons to George Lucas for the tendency to screw with his movies, but this guy has literally turned into him!  Draw a comparison picture and you'll see what I mean.  Funny.

Andrew Laszlo reminded me of GOLDMEMBER.

Most of the people who have reviewed this dvd have very strong feelings against it.  I don't blame them.  This newer version isn't totally without value, but I could have done without it.  If it absolutely HAD to be made, then the least they could have done was keep the original, remaster all it's components, and then add this newer one as a throw-in.  I know some people, especially newer audiences, don't have patience for dated movies, so for that reason only would I suggest that you may have use for this dvd in showing it to them.

But if you're only going own one version of this movie, try and get the first edition that came out.  It is currently out of print, but I would suggest either going on ebay where you can get a new or used copy for less than it's being sold here, or burn from a rental or friend.  If you like this movie alot, then I would only recommend buying this newer dvd for the extras and higher quality picture.",1134950400,3,4990,4.483906770255272
236833,5,6300213714,"No, this film isn't ""realistic,"" exactly.  It's more of an urban mythology.  The story is rooted in greek history, which this version of the film explains in the beginning.  It's also an urban version of Homer's the Odyssey, in many ways, about a perilous trip back home.  Anyone with an intimate knowledge of that work will see it played out in this film.

There are instances that recall the Greek Sirens... parts in the film where our heroes are suduced by film fatales and come close to meeting their doom or, in one case, get busted.

WHY NO GUNS?

The  gangs  in this film are a different kind of gangster.  Rather than cap each other off, these guys are a ""street fighter"" variety of gangster.  These gangsters don't come across as a result of poverty or social ills.  These  are more like a bunch of stupid kids  who join a gang because it's a fad or they just want to prove something.

236835,3,6300213714,"This Joe Silver late 70s brainchild, with Walter Hill in early career directing form, is pretty much considered a cult film with an uncanny ability to predict the dreadful style of 80s clothing and bad haircuts that would proceed it, is not really such an action packed movie, or very violent, but does have a number of interesting concepts, that are enough to sustain it. The title refers to a gang in the story, The Warriors, who after a city boss group truce meeting goes bad, must make their way from one end of New York City to the other, avoiding and fighting with other gangs along the way. Each gang, such as The Furies, The Boppers, The Rogues, The High-Hats, The Lizzies, The Turnbull A.C.'s, and The Gramercy Riffs have their own identity, such as baseball-bat wielding white crow-style face-painted mute killer gangs to gangs of women with a penchant for hostage taking. Much of these encounters are repeated over and over. It is the costume design that is on show here, rather than a plot or the names involved. All in all you will certainly want to check it out as an interesting piece of low budget action that seems to have some connotations with more popular independent films of the 70s, early 80s, but never really seems to want to earn the acclaim that those movies do.

236888,4,6300213714,"I first saw this when I was a kid, on On TV, not in the theatres.  It was probably a couple of years old by then, but I was entranced by all the different gangs, their bizarre costumes, the unfairness of the framing of them based solely on a very creepy David Patrick Kelly and his freaky bottles.  I even went so far as to track down the original book by Sol Yurick, which was checked out for about a year.  The book is radically different and quite an eye opener, i.e. it's not the comic-like cult film, it's read nasty, in your face, no happy self-examination of the lives their leading and the concept of getting out of it.  The library probably would have been slapped with child endangerment today for lending it out to an 11-year-old.

That said, this is one of the few films that you think was totally awesome as a kid and DON'T cringe with embarassment when watching it as an adult.  Not that I'll be showing it to my son anytime soon.

It was buying the new video game based on the movie and an ad in it that even alerted me to the director's cut.  The ad was, um, overenthusiastic.  They didn't weave cut scenes back in, there's no commentary, it's got funky comic-book like transition scenes that sometimes cut into scenes in such a way to actually lose a few lines.  That said, it does have a hefty amount of 'making of' featurettes, including interviewing several of the actors today.  Brace yourself, they're old now, but they have a lot of interesting things to say and are very thoughtful, intelligent, and profound.  The featurettes are what make this worth buying if you love the movie, but I will also keep the original version rather than getting rid of it as I usually do, just so I can go back and see the scenes without the comic book transitions.",1131321600,,1771,4.398773006134969
236889,3,6300213714,"I loved the Warriors when it was released but had not seen it for many years.  Watching this new release, I was a little concerned whether or not it would hold up over time.  I must confess that the fight scenes aren't quite as gritty or intense by today's standards and the music is almost funny it is so synthesized.  But the movie is still very entertaining.  Watching the Warriors fight their way home using brains at least as much as brawn is a great ride.

What is not great is the new Director's Cut edition which treats us to yet another director ""improving"" a film that should have been left alone.  Why anyone would think that adding in comic book page transition scenes would make the film better is a mystery to me.  Every time they come up on screen, they jar you out of the story and disrupt the flow of the movie.  Seriously, it's like something from a bad high school film project.

I would givethe Warriors 4 stars as a film because it is a good (but not great) film.  It's entertaining and holds up reasonably well even after all this time.  But I am forced to deduct 1 star for the director desecrating the movie with the ridiculous comic book transitions.

236890,4,6300213714,"I don't know why but I never thought I'd like this movie. I never gave it a chance until the video game came out and it became one of my new favorite games. So I decided to check-out the movie and I must say it's a fun and cool movie. Surprisingly though the game has more of a story. It gives you back stories to why Cleon started the Warriors and to how people like Swan joined up with them. It also gives Cleon a bigger part and he sounds a lot like Samual L. Jackson lol. The movie just has the Warriors trying to get back to Coney Island after they are framed for killing a big gang leader. While besides that, the game has them getting into all sorts of trouble. Plus in the game you get to kick Luther's ass as Swan when they don't fight in the movie.  So in ways it's superior than the movie since you'd love to see Swan kick his ass in the movie.

  Still though the movie is great fun for what it is. The acting isn't bad either by it's unrecognizeable cast of actors. Watching the movie made me wonder why guys like Michael  Beck (Swan), didn't go one to bigger and better. He's great as Swan who has to be the Warriors new leader after the gang gets seperated from it's leader Cleon. He gives one of the most badass performances I ever seen.

  James Remar (The Phanton, 48 Hours, Blade Trinity) is the most recognizeable actor because he's still in many movies and tv shows today. He plays the toughest guy in the gang next to Swan. Always wanting to get laid gets him in trouble though. The movies strongest point is probably the relationship between Swan and Mercy. She's a tough girl who doesn't mind getting into trouble and wants to be part of the Warriors as soon as she sees them. She was with the Orphans but they aren't tough enough for her. Swan just sees her as trouble but he's also curious about her and wants to understand her. She also wants to understand him. The two have strong chemestry too so it adds something nice to the movie besides all the running and fighting.

  I hear that Tony Scott has a remake planned for 2006 and that's a shame. Although I did pretty much call the game better. That at least stayed true to the movie without really trying to out-due it or be better. I don't want to see anyone else play Swan or a remake without the corny 70's music. I mean who's gonna play Swan, the girly Orlando Bloom ?? lol. If you like movies like the Outsiders or even Sin City, you should check-out the Warriors.",1130889600,2,2450,4.236051502145923

236892,2,6300213714,"A note on my rating, I give 5 stars to the original version and only 2 to the director's cut.

First, general review:
The Warriors is a dystopia vision of a New York City sometime in the near future - a city overrun by innumerable, and often outlandish, gangs.  They're divided, disorganized, and often at each others throats until the leader of the largest gang in NY, Cyrus of the Riffs, comes up with a plan - he wants to unite all gangs under his banner and take control of the city in a mafioso type fashion.  All eyes point to a revolution until he is shot, and soon after that one of the gangs, the Warriors, is blamed for his death.  The situation turns into a flight for life as the Warriors race back to their home on Coney Island before the dozens of gangs manage to catch them first.

This movie at its heart is B-quality; bad dialogue, no-name actors (at least, at the time this was filmed), horribly inaccurate portrayal of the subway system, dumb fight scenes, and a far-out plot... this all adds up to a fantastically fun movie.

Now, if you're going to get this movie - do yourself a favor and watch the original untainted version.  The 'Ultimate Director's Cut' scrambles what was already a very tight film.

The new comic cut scenes make a movie that was fun to watch Because it took itself so seriously, it makes it seem very cheap, not to mention is slows down the pacing and screws up some of the scenes and lines.
The greater tie-in with the real events that this movie is loosely based upon is completely unnecessary.  Such a fact is fun to know in hindsight but does nothing for the movie itself.

The Director's Cut should've just made available interviews and deleted scenes (which it didn't even include all the deleted scenes).  Even adding back into the movie some deleted scenes would've been acceptable - but not adding in the comic-book scene transition.  They pulled a Lucas, taking something that was special and cutting it off at the knees in an attempt to rewrite history and 'improve' the final product.  Disappointing.

EDIT:
I managed to see many of the cast from this movie last fall at Chiller Theater (2006), each of them I asked which version of The Warriors they liked more.  All of them responded the original version.  BTW, if you ever get a chance to meet Dorsey Wright (Cleon) go for it - the guy is freakin' awesome - ask him about how he was cut from a larger role in the film ;)",1130457600,10,2430,4.451467268623025
236947,3,6300213714,"I agree with most of the other reviews.  Stay away from this unless you care to see interviews with the principals. Granted the featurettes are pretty extensive but this release is very disappointing. I mean-1) Why not include the  original version of the film on a separate disc? I for one did not like the ""comic book"" cut-to scenes and just wish I could see the movie as it played in the theatre.  An example to me of where the comic-scenes really hurt the film is with the ending credits. In this new version, the Joe Walsh/Eagles ""In the City"" plays over a comic page.  The theatrical version shows the characters walking away as though they are moving on to a better life.  In this case, the comic book structure removes the emotion and feeling the original closing credits offered. 2) Is Paramount telling us that with all the people who sat down for interviews, not one of them was willing to do a commentary? The visual nature of this movie makes it perfect for a voice-over.  I know chances are the commentary would have repeated much of what the interviews said, but come on, a commentary option would not have hurt. Paramount probably did want to pay anyone for an extra 90 minutes worth of work.  3) I've been hearing about deleted scenes for years. Where were these?

Paramount Home video does not care about fans who cherish a ""cult"" classic. This is the second ""special"" release of theirs I purchased which really shortchanges the fans who embrace every nuance about a movie.  I purchased the 25th anniversary edition of ""Chinatown.""  What did we get? A bunch of short, been-there-done-that interviews, that's it. ABout 10 years ago PBS did a special on detective films and in 5 minutes told me more about ""Chinatown"" than all the shallow interviews on the DVD combined.

All in all, I was excited about ""The Warriors"" being given it's just due on DVD and have enjoyed watching the featurettes, some more than once. But I am extremely disappointed with how Paramount decided to once again diss consumers and film lovers just to make a quick buck. Come on Paramount-we show you the money, show your consumers some enthusiasm!",1130371200,3,2140,4.695187165775401

Then the movie begins, What is this? The comic book transitions in this cut is the worst idea to ruin an already-tight movie since ""Greedo shoots first"". The weak extras are not enough to fix this mistake of a director's cut. They blew it. I hope they try it again with a DVD worthy of this film.",1130198400,19,572,4.153153153153153

Thats right, I've never seen the original version.  But I have to say going into this one that I had no idea what to expect and I was pleasantly surprised.  The simple story is pretty tight, and the cinematography is fantastic.  Here's the thing that surprises me the most though, one of my favorite aspects of the movie was the comic story boards, and I come to find out they were not in the original movie.  And to top that off appearently the die-hards are bothered by this.  From a new perspective I have to say, c'mon people don't you know how awsome that is.  I understand this is probably as bad as Star Wars 97' to some, but I have to say that I don't think I would have enjoyed the movie as much without the comic touch.

 On another topic, I'm sick of gangster trailers and special features on new editions like scarface and this film.  It's a pretty obvious sell out when a company supports thuggary in order to boost sales.

236950,4,6300213714,"Director Walter Hill has decided to revisit his movie and altered it slightly so that it closer resembles his original comic book vision. His new tweaks to the movie are obvious right from the get-go as he narrates an opening scrawl featuring parallels to some nonsense about what we are about to see with a Greek myth. Some of the scene transitions are now done in a more overt, comic book style a la panels featuring stylized frames from the movie. It doesn't look too bad but is unnecessary and does tend to upset the rhythm of the film somewhat.

The Warriors is set almost entirely at night and presents the city as a dark, foreboding labyrinth fraught with danger that lurks around every corner, much like what Escape From New York would capitalize on for an even greater effect. Even though Hill claims this to be a comic book-like film, it really doesn't feel or look like one despite his recent tinkering. The gritty setting, the ominous music and the constant danger that our heroes are in doesn't evoke a comic book vibe at all. And this is what fans of the film like about it.

""The Warriors: The Beginning"" examines the film's origins. This featurette also takes a look at the casting process including an amusing anecdote that James Remar tells of how he got the role of Ajax.

""The Warriors: Battleground"" examines the filming process. They shot mostly at night and on location in New York City. It was a tough one as principal photography took place during the summer with short nights and in rough neighbourhoods.

""The Warriors: The Way Home"" explores how the encounters with various gangs, like the Baseball Furies, was done. Cast and crew members dish some great anecdotes in this featurette.

""The Warriors: Phenomenon"" examines the end of the film, the post-production process and its enduring legacy. Fans will delight in David Patrick Kelly's recounting of how he came up with the film's most famous line.

And overall its alot of fun. its ridiculous because  the purests who are bashing it are probably diehards who own the original dvd release along with the old vhs like i do. In that case, , put in the original version and presto, you have the pure unadulterated theatrical movie.

  What this directors cut  offers is  a very decent series of featurettes that give you an in depth look at the inner workings of the film. Its also  a chance to see some of the films stars , people like Michael Beck, James Remar, David Harris and David Patrick Kelly among others as they look today and hear their account of the film and what it was like being a young person  at the time in New York. also, my personal fave  additions  are the movie stills included in the  featurette that show close-ups of the individual furies and turnbull's among others.  One of the most interesting dvd special features  ive seen yet as most are borefests, with the exception of the ""Duel"" SE dvd.

  Let's face facts. The Warriors is a comic book brought to life. so why not  play around with the concept to give the  original fans something new to look at. It makes it look a bit campy, but hey, nothing wrong with that. The fact its based on the  Novel means nothing, because if you hve ever read the book, you probably wouldnt recognize the story as being the Warriors.  Walter hill took  the books basic premise and took it over the Top.  In fact, the books author Sol Yurick hated the Movie when it was originally released back in 79.

The one thing i would have liked to see included was full deleted scenes such as  the Boardwalk pre-meeting, the additional bathroom brawl footage or even the  police car speeding to the scene at Coney island at the films end . i have all this footage on vhs from various  TV late shows but it would be cool  to see as part of this package.

 So all you bashers, take your own advice, hold on to the original as anyone into this movie should do. but enjoy the featurettes and lighten up .  Don't worry, when the remake MTV version of this film comes out in 06, this Directors cut is going to start to look a whole lot better",1128729600,5,2335,4.335648148148148
237009,2,6300213714,"I find it very hard to believe that this is the version of the film Walter Hill intended.  It sounds more to me like he had this idea of the comic strip shots in his head a couple of times when he was making it, and then discarded it, knowing it wouldn't work.  But when the idea of a Director's Cut DVD came up 25 years later, he probably decided to say, ""Yes, this was the version I was thinking after all.""

When the Warriors first was released in 1979, it was electrifying.  It was a dark gangster film, taking place all night, with a glitzy look.  Underneath this gang movie was a simple, fun comic strip.  What made it so entertaining for me was watching the gangster story on the surface and seeing the comic strip aspect underneath.  Like Star Wars (which was a space adventure on the surface but a western like adventure underneath), the Warriors entertained us with it's combined genres.  Seeing a movie about gangs, with the electric like score, colorful costumes, and well staged action sequences brought out the excitement in us.

This film doesn't need these unnecessary comic strip drawings that have been inserted in the Director's Cut.  These changes make it too obvious it's a comic film.  The gangs are no longer menacing.  The story no longer has suspense.  Maybe I'm being bious because I'm so used to the original version but I just don't see where Walter Hill thinks these additions help.

The other features are entertaining.  I liked the documentary of the making of the films to an extent.  I would have preferred more interviews with some of the other actors though.  When they talked about what a great performance Roger Hill gave as Cyrus, I was waiting to see him interviewed.

237010,2,6300213714,"Why in the Hell did Walter Hill decided to add those stupid comic book like scenes and cut some very cool scenes? According to him, he wanted to make sure that people knew like this was some kind of fantasy-type film, like we didn't know that.

The Warriors is a masterpiece, and this is a director's vut alright, he cut the good stuff and added crappy comic book sh_t. At least they should've added 2 edtions of the film on this DVD, the theatrical release and the butchered director's cut.

I do like the way they remastered the footage, looks very updated. The special features are good, too. However, many fans of this film including myself are gonna be mad about how Walter Hill destroyed his own film on DVD.

No wonder he hasn't had a hit in years, he must be brain dead.",1128643200,11,778,4.388888888888889
237011,2,6300213714,"If you wanted any clearer indication that Director's Cut DVD's aren't always a great idea, look no further than this ""ultimate"" reworking of The Warriors, a wonderfully pure piece of high concept cinema from the late 70's that has been transformed - by a director clearly out of his mind in thinking this kind of inane pretentiousness would improve matters - into comic-booky codswallop. Literally.

If you've been paying attention to the one-star reviews that are flooding these pages, you're now aware that the new cut enhances what Walter Hill sees as the story's comic book origins (when in fact it was adapted from a novel) by inserting actual comic book-style panels as scene transitions, complete with dialogue balloons and ""Meanwhile..."" tags. But even worse than this is a new intro, which announces to one and all the roots of the story in the works of Greek historian Xenophon. It does this with bad, bad, BAD drawings (I was a comic book artist for ten years, so trust me, I know bad comic art), and narration from Hill himself that is in *grammatically incorrect English*!! Get this: it begins, ""Over two millenniums ago..."" WTF? ""Millenniums""? Unless we're also seeing a new ""Ultimate Director's Cut"" of the English language, as far as I recall the plural of ""millennium"" is ""millennia"". A veteran writer/director like Walter Hill can't even put his hands on a frickin' DICTIONARY?

Now, I'm generously granting an extra star for the bonus documentaries because they actually are pretty decent. We learn a lot about the difficulties with the shoot. Most of the original cast has been reassembled. We learn interesting bits of trivia, like the fact that Luther's famous taunt ""Warriorrrrrs, come out to plaaaay-aaayyy"" was improvised by that actor right there on the set. Or that the Baseball Furies' makeup was inspired by Kiss. We don't hear enough about the real life post-release controversy, such as the gang violence that really erupted during some screenings. But overall, the docs are worth seeing for fans of the movie.

I do give thumbs down for no deleted scenes section. The well-known alternate opening, set during the day with Cleon's girlfriend begging him not to go to Cyrus's meeting is seen only in clips in one of the docs. They should have included it in its entirety, the way that the Escape From New York SE included the entire deleted bank robbery and capture opening. (I do agree, BTW, with the decision to keep it out of the final cut. The movie's structure from night to day gives it a perfectly consistent atmosphere. To go from day to night back to day would have been a less effective choice.)

As for a commentary, okay, if Hill doesn't like them he doesn't have to do one. But why not the cast, or the producers, or some well-known critic who's a fan of the film? Really a letdown.

The best I can recommend is renting this just to see the docs if you're a big fan of the movie. But if you already own the previous movie-only DVD from a few years ago, FOR GOD'S SAKE DON'T GET RID OF IT.",1128643200,17,3031,4.722117202268431
237012,1,6300213714,"After almost a year of anticipation, the trumpeted ""ultimate director's cut"" of the beloved 1979 camp classic arrived - and it made George Lucas's belated Star Wars reeditions, with their already proverbially inane ""Greedo shooting first"" and ""Hayden Christensen's head inserted over Sebastian Shaw"" changes look like genuine improvements.

Walter Hill just managed to do what medicine previously thought unimaginable - he raped himself. He took a film loved by no less than four generations and murdered it, spat on it and desecrated its corpse.

The ""ultimate cut"" was turned into an imbecilic quasi-comic book film. Hill destroyed numerous legendary scenes by inserting awkward zooms, awkward cuts at pivotal moments, and - oh, heaven have mercy - freezes and transitions into ""stylized"" pseudo-comic book panels (actually seemingly made with the emboss filter of Photoshop), often complete with inane ""thought bubble"" comments.

Case in point - the scene in which the Warriors encounter the Furies. A powerful scene in which tension grows with every second, conveyed only through the actors' eyes and Barry de Vorzon's slowly creeping-up score. At least that is how it looked originally... because in the new version, at the second when the tension just began growing, the ""new"" film freezes and transforms into an idiotic comic book panel complete with - oh, God, why?!? - an imbecilic bubble comment stating ""Holy sh..., the Baseball Furies!"". That's how bad the new version is - and this isn't even the worst example.

He shattered the mystery of the ambient ""Wonder Wheel"" opening by inserting an absolutely unnecessary animate reference to Anabasis before it. And, worst of all, he obliterated the wonderful ending scene. You know it - it is the symbolic take showing the survivors  as they walk away from the memory of the night of horror towards the - perhaps hopeful - fresh dawn. I called this scene ""the walk to nowhere - somewhere - everywhere"".

In the new version, the walk is frozen after a few seconds and spliced into four idiotic comic book panels which then remain on screen. That single change is so wretchedly disgraceful that it defies belief. It is akin to taking, say, the closing scene of ""The Godfather"" and cutting it at the moment when Michael Corleone sits and thinks, rolling end credits at that moment rather than following it to show the legendary ""new don"" conclusion.

As the final insult, the DVD does not offer any worthy extras. There are some standard featurettes, but not much beyond that. Hill ""does not believe in commentaries"", apparently, so this is absent, but doesn't he believe in viewers' rights to watch deleted scenes, either?

It's true that most deleted scenes, in any films, on any DVD, are usually worthless and epitomize drivel - yet even truly bad ones are often included, since any viewer devoted to any film is always interested in seeing extra footage from it. I understand that Walter Hill may feel ashamed of those scenes and does not want them to be viewed even as a curiosity. I would not be surprised if some of them had not even been shot by him (particularly the infamous, awful day opening) - that would make his objection against their inclusion perfectly justified. However, considering that deleted scenes that do make it to existing DVDs as extra features very rarely represent all material that was cut from the film, and taking into account the typical running time of most rough cuts and workprints from late 70s, I would suspect that there was well over half an hour of alternate or additional footage shot - and that would be enough to choose some interesting snippets for the disc. And, Mister Hill... however bad even the worst deleted scene was, it would be practically impossible for it to be worse than the comic book insertions in the Ultimately Disgraceful Cut.

If there is anything worth having in this disc, it's the new cover. It restores the original 1979 poster - the famous gang conclave in the park, with the tagline ""They are the armies of the night"". (The UK version has this cover, anyway. The US release apparently features an idiotic, oversaturated ""Photochop"" of a random scene from the film instead - identical to the previously available DVD's cover, but tinted in ""angry"" MTV red now...)

If that travesty is indeed representative of the concept that Walter Hill originally had in his mind in 1979, then I praise the studio board that changed it into the version that the audience knows and loves.",1128556800,457,4499,4.931307793923382
237013,1,6300213714,"As a serious fan of this movie I am completely pissed off at Walter Hill chose to put his comic book interpretation in this movie, without also adding the original verision so people can at least see the version that was released in the theatres at the time.  And in the featurette according to the principals connected with making this movie,the opening scene with Cleon talking to his girlfriend before going up to the Bronx,(usually shown on the cable versions of this film),this was left out since they thought that this scene was unnecessary since most of the movie takes place at night.  How stupid is that when we have a daylight scene at the end of the movie?  It would add value to the scene that starts of with Cleon talking about them going to the Bronx in the beginning.  And what the hell (?), how to you cut the part when Ajax, sees the Baseball Furies for the first time, go to another scene of Cleon, Vermin and Rembrandt getting on a different train, and then go back to the station shot with Ajax, Swan, Snow and Cowboy seeing the Furies?  WHAT THE HELL????  Thank god I kept the original DVD!  The only thing good on this DVD is the featurettes.  And while we are at it, why must you go through 8 previews before you can even skip to the damm movie????  And let's not even talk about the ending of the movie a freeze framed comic strip!??!!!!!  OMG!!! It's terrible!

I like the fact that the movie is clearer, and the sound is fantastic. And I also realize that this is the director's cut.

Where did all of these cartoon cutouts come from between scenes?

Was this REALLY Walter Hill's vision in 1978 or 27 years later in 2005?

I could have ignored all of that, but, to me, the most egregious error is Hill cutting off the last scene in the movie, during the credits, when they were all walking off into the sunrise.

That was a nice way to end this movie and I don't know WHY he was so fascinated with this comic book motif, that he would cut this scene off COMPLETELY to use these comic book pictures to end the film.

They showed a clip of a deleted scene between Cleon and his girlfriend earlier that day before they left for the Bronx and if they had of cut that type of stuff back into the movie than that would have been okay but the whole comic book  idea was corny and I'll be selling the one I bought today and I vow to never watch it again because now the original is going to be a collectors item.

The Director's Cut of The Warriors falls closer to that end of the spectrum occupied by the ""Deckard is a Replicant"" version of Blade Runner and Apocalypse Now Redux as the rare bird that improves upon the original.

The previously comic bookesque wipes are enhanced by scene changes taking place within panels of a comic book, further cementing the aura.  Considering the film's allegorical nature of the story of the stranded Greek warriors, it's like an updated Classics Illustrated that is updated even further.

237097,1,6300213714,"Damn you Walter hill,

You were suppossed to put together a directors cut of all the extra scenes we kids saw on t.v. when we watched this awesome movie in the 70's.

So there is all that and yet you still could not put in all the extra scenes you shot. The fans want longer, and the teaser for the dvd said deleted scenes, where the damn are they? No commentary, and this widscreen edition is not widescreen on my t.v.

You have alot to answer for and it won't be pretty if you ever meet some fans from Portland. We will raid on you Walter Hill your ultimate edition SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1128384000,16,1247,4.044534412955466
237098,4,6300213714,"This ""Ultimate Director's Edition"" represents the way that Hill originally intended to cut the film when it was released including the use of comic graphics to introduce each section and act as transitions between scenes. I've seen some criticism of this as a ""rip off"" but having seen the DVD, I didn't think it was at all. As Hill notes this version of ""The Warriors"" was what he had in mind when he first directed the film. Hill wanted the chance to make this much closer to the way he originally envisioned the film. There's no commentary track because Hill doesn't believe in doing them.

A gang called the Warriors is falsely accused of assassinating Cyrus (Roger Hill) a gang leader trying to unite all the gangs by the actual killer. Shot at a meeting for all the gangs where Cyrus was suggesting they unite vs. fight each other,  the Warriors led by Swan (Michael Beck)  must get his fellow Warriors (Dorsey Wright, Brian Tyler, David Harris, Tom McKitterick) back safely to their home surf in Coney Island. Swan's job is complicated by the fact that Ajar (James Remar) challenges him as the new leader of the gang. Unfortunately the Warriors must brave the streets and every other gang member who is out to kill them to avenge the murder of Cyrus.

A beautiful, rich transfer for ""The Warriors"" is a real plus for this set. The film was previously available in a no frills widescreen presentation in its original cut. Grain is readily apparent in the film but that's to be expectated given that much of the film was shot at night with high speed film. The colors are rich and deep with excellent skin tones. The blacks are rich and dark as a great cup of black coffee. The original mono track is available here but the highlight is the 5.1 remix. The remix makes good use of the 5.1 format spreading the action around the speakers. An excellent job from Paramount and director Hill in putting this fine set together.

Walter Hill appears in an introduction discussing his intention in recutting ""The Warriors"" and bringing it closer to his original vision. There are four featurettes included. The first ""The Warriors: The Beginning"" features Producer Larry Gordon discussing how he discovered Sol Yorick's novel. He was spinning around a paperback holder and his imagination immediately was captured by the cover. He optioned it and approached Walter Hill about directing a film version based on the cover. The novel is supposedly more sociological. Writer David Shaber based his screenplay on the image from the cover and the 4th century Greek writer Xenophon. When the western that Hill and Gordon had planned fell apart, Gordon suggested that Hill direct ""The Warriors"". Hill took the overall look of the film from the comic book genre when the studio wouldn't let him do a realistic gang drama with African-American and Hispanic actors. Hill rewrote the script going in the comic book direction knowing that it would be more likely to be made that way. Hill discovered actor Michael Beck when he screened a film featuring Sigorney Weaver. James Remar also shares the story of his audition and how he impressed Hill by pretending he was handcuffed to the table and lifted it as he tried to escape. Most of the major cast members are interviews in this terrific featurette.

""The Warriors: The Battleground"" focuses on the production issues and challenges that Hill and his team faced with this low budget movie. Shot on location in New York, Hill couldn't get most crews to work with him. They flew in a assistant director from Los Angeles when they no longer had their first A.D.  Assistant Director David O. Sosna had to prove himself because most L.A. directors weren't really well thought of when it came to action scenes shot on the streets of New York. Nights shooting on the subways proved to be a bit of a challenge as well.
***
""The Warriors: The Way Home"" focuses on the battles that are choreographed for The Warriors' journey home. Hill wanted the battle with The Furies to look like a Kurosawa fight sequence. In ""The Warriors: The Phenomenon"" the cast and crew discuss the post production experience of the film including the decision to go with a synthesizer score. We also find out about having Orson Welles narrate the opening. Unfortunately, the agreement with Welles fell apart. Hill mentions when he first found out about the audience reaction to the film as well as the critical reaction when it was released. What killed the business was the fear that gang violence would break out in theaters. While some of that concern was founded the studio panicked and pulled advertising on the film. The film continued to do good business despite all of this. There's also an illustration of the original opening sequence for the film which was cut. We also get deleted scenes for the film none of which would have improved the film to any larger degree. The original theatrical trailer (which isn't in the best shape) is included as well as previews for other Paramount films. The only mistake that Paramount made here was not making this into a seamlessly branching edition with both the original theatrical version and Hill's ""Ultimate Director's Cut"". One deleted scene is included in the featurette portion with Hill discussing why he cut the sequence.

If you're a fan of ""The Warriors"" you may or may not be happy with this version of the film. Hill has changed the film slightly to bring it closer to his original vision of the film. The image and sound quality is top notch with a 5.1 Dolby Digital Surround mix for the film as well as a 2.0 mix. Hill hates doing commentary tracks and is very uncomfortable even discussing his films in featurettes (he feels it robs the films of the magic) but this is a film that is close to his heart and we can thank Paramount for convincing him to do the special features and restructuring the film to his original vision.",1127692800,22,5895,4.744390243902439

Listen up boppers.  Paramount is RIPPING YOU OFF because they think you're too stupid to recognize when you're being ripped off.

There are rumors that the region II release will include a director's commentary from Hill (somehow I doubt it though), and also seven deleted scenes.

The intensity is unparallelled; there is not one moment in this movie where you can even take your eyes off the screen, much less get up and go to the bathroom.  The city of New York is as much a star of this movie as any of the remarkably talented and charismatic actors.  I loved this movie so much I bought the book by Sol Yurik.  The book is nowhere near as intense; it appears to be a book for teens and young adults and is quite mild compared to the movie.  But God bless Sol Yurik for writing the inspiration for this cinematic masterpiece. Yes, it's a little dated by today's standards; today's gangs would all be armed with automatic weapons.

237207,4,6300213714,"One may think that this is the standard and typical gang potboiler, but in fact it is somewhat more intelligent than that.

The major story line involves a summit involving the top 200 or so gangs. Led by the Grammercy Riffs, the big goal is to unite the gangs to overrun NYC.

The major problem is that their leader, Cyrus is whacked by one of his rivals, The Rogues, but the blame is placed squarely on the Warriors. Now, the Warriors have to fight their way home to Coney Island, far far away from their meeting place in the Bronx.

The Warriors falls under the John Carpenter 1970's school of film making. It is atmospheric and provides a shallow level social commentary on the decay of morality and law (Coming from the Jimmy Carter era of politics) that eventually led to the conservatism of movies in the 1980s with movies like Dirty Harry and Death Wish. The music, from Tangerine Dream is both atmospheric and evokes a sense of hopelessness which suits the movie and explains the mission of our gang very well.

The main characters also do a great job with their cartoon characters. Michael Beck is wonderfully understated as Swan, the new war chief. He is well complemented by James Remar who plays Ajax, the unpredictable and emotional second in charge. There is also Mercy, who is played by Deborah Van Valkenburgh. She is the spunky romantic type lead who is emotional damaged goods and seeks men for sex to forget about her miserable life.

On the bad side is Luther, played by David Patrick Kelly. reminiscent of Joacquim Phoenix's Emperor Commodus with his slightly pshchotic, slightly uncontrollable personality. He also mutters the best line in the movie (see title) while clanking some bottles.

While this movie seems very simplistic, I feel that it does have some resemblance of some Greek mythology. It is reminiscent of Anabasis, the story of 10K Greek mercenaries sent off to fight in Persia but then must find their way home when their boss dies. In the Greek story, the bosses name is Cyrus, also the name of the Riffs leader who is killed in the beginning of the movie. The Warriors is also reminiscent of the Odyessy, which also includes the seduction of the Warriors by the Sirens, who are represented by a lesbian gang called the Lizzies. A third reference is the character of Ajax, which was a warrior that fought in the Trojan war. He was a brave but impetuous warrior that raped Princess Cassandra and was eventually punished by the gods. In the movie, Ajax is a fighter that does not think things through and he is ultimately brought down when he tries to rape a woman in a Park.

The movie also has hints of the ""Clockwork Orange"" in it's portrayal of cartoon like gangs. The gang culture is similar to more like superhero cartoons, rather than gritty street life. There are gangs that involve multicultured skinheads (the Turnbull AC's), hicks in overalls on rollerskates (gang name unknown), baseball players (The furies) and bunch of kids who look like leftover trash (The Orphans), African Americans in silk pajamas/karate outfits (The Riffs). These colorful gangsters with even more colorful names are reminiscient of The Droogs much more than say, the Bloods or the Crips.

Presumably this is to coincide with the 'remake' (bleh) but if that's what it takes to get commentaries and cut scenes, then ok.",1119225600,,337,4.365079365079365
237209,4,6300213714,"Any time I bring The Warriors (1979) up or even hint at it to one of my friends, he invariably always apes the same line of dialog from the film, ""Warriors, come out and playyyy!"".  If you've seen the film, you know this as probably the most recognizable line in the movie, but if you haven't, well, it's something much better experienced rather than me trying to explain the context in which it is presented in the movie.  Co-written and directed by Walter Hill (Hard Times, 48 Hrs.), the film features a number of actors including Michael Beck (Xanadu, Warlords of the 21st Century), James Remar, whom many will recognize as the crazed antagonist Ganz in Hill's later Eddie Murphy/Nick Nolte film 48 Hrs. (1982), Deborah Van Valkenburgh (Brain Smasher... A Love Story), and David Patrick Kelly, who also appeared in 48 Hrs., along with other films like Dreamscape (1984), Commando (1985), and more recently in just released remake The Longest Yard (2005).

The film begins as we learn Cyrus, charismatic leader of the biggest, baddest gang (the Grammercy Riffs) in the whole NY area wants to hold a meeting of all the gangs in an effort to consolidate their collective resources, creating a vast army of the night and effectively taking over the city.  In order to facilitate the gathering, instructions are put forth that each gang is meant to send nine members, no one is to be armed with weapons, and a general truce is in effect allowing the various gangs to cross each others `turf' in order to arrive at the planned meet area.  The various gangs seem reluctant to attend such a meeting, but they all show up, including members of the Warriors, who make the trip all the way from their turf of Coney Island.  Shortly after Cyrus begins his speech, a gunshot is issued from the crowd, and Cyrus falls...to which someone blames the Warriors (undeservedly).  Right about now is when the police show up to bust up the party, and mayhem ensues (along with lots of heads getting beat in).  During the confusion, the Warriors manage to escape, but now find themselves deep within rival gang territories without any weapons, their leader missing (or worse), and a target of a massive manhunt by not only all the other gangs, but also by the police.  Thus begins their long and dangerous trek back to their home turf...

I found this film to be pretty interesting and a lot of fun.  One thing I really liked was seeing not only the external difficulties of the Warriors in having to move through unfamiliar and dangerous territories, but also the internal struggles they faced due to the fact they were without a leader.  Most of the characters were pretty distinctive in that we had the slightly enigmatic war chief Swan (Beck) having to assume the role of leader which most of the others are more than happy to follow his lead, with the exception of the hot headed Ajax (Remar), who consistently expresses his desire to engage in the physical activity of busting heads, rather than the course of action which they're currently employing being that of trying to elude those who are after them, fighting only when no other option is available.  The latter seems the more intelligent method, especially since the enemies are numerous and varied, and the battleground unfamiliar.  The distinction between the gangs was also interesting as they weren't so much divided by race (although the Riffs appeared mainly African American), but more so by manner of dress and/or appearance.  We have the Furies, who dressed in baseball uniforms and carried baseball bats as their main choice of weapon, the High Hats (mime-like characters), the Lizzzies (an all girl gang, some of whom seemed quite mannish), the Turnbull ACs (bald-headed and highly aggressive), among many others.  Given the often outlandish differences between the gangs it was obvious they weren't created to forward a sense of realism, but probably to provide a clear delineation between the various factions (some of the gangs reminded me of that one episode of the 70's TV show Happy Days where Ritchie, Ralph, and Potsie find themselves facing off against a goofy gang in the school gym).  But then we had the very realistic element of the film being shot entirely on location (at least that's what I think), so there is this unreal element put into a very real environment creating an unusual dichotomy driving the viewers interest.  Adding to the this is the minimal and often frank dialog, along with the attitudes and general streetwise nature of the characters.  Another element I really liked was how the information on the Warrior's progress was relayed to the various gangs by utilizing the female radio DJ as she made subtle remarks in-between songs.  One scene that stands out in my mind is when the Warriors (who were pretty adaptable if you really think about it) find themselves confronted by one of the lesser gangs, one called the Orphans.  At first they manage to come to an uneasy agreement through a little give and take, but that soon falls apart as an unknown element (a female) provides a manipulatory source of instigation, ultimately causing an escalation to the point of violence.  I thought the cast in general did very well although it seemed David Patrick Kelly performance was a little over the top but perhaps that was intentional.  I just found it hard to buy off on the fact someone so screwed up and psychotic could manage to ascend to the level of leadership as he did within his own gang, but then this is a world where not only strength, but also the appearance of strength, along with a propensity towards violence goes a long way.  I thought the direction really strong, as Hill kept things moving along well, even during the scenes with relatively little activity (there weren't that many, as the characters are constantly on the run).  One really great action sequence worth price of admission alone is the confrontation in the subway bathroom when the Warriors square off against a gang of toughs in overalls (I read somewhere it took a week to complete filming on this sequence).

The widescreen anamorphic (1.85:1) picture on this DVD is clean and clear, and the Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono audio comes through well.  Some will be disappointed by the lack of extra features (all that's included is a trailer), but I have heard the possibility of a more extensive release in the future, perhaps coinciding with the upcoming remake scheduled to be released in 2006, with Tony Scott (The Last Boy Scout, True Romance) listed as director.

By the way, in case you're wondering, those extraordinarily large and poofy hairdos sported by a few of the cast members are called afros.  They were pretty popular back in the 70's for some inexplicable reason.",1117152000,2,6758,4.825974025974026
237210,4,6300213714,"The Warriors is an entertaining piece of puffed up macho gang fluff.  The story has a comic book simplicity, but Walter Hill moves the not-exactly-easy-to-swallow story along with such gusto I still liked it.

Cyrus, the leader of the most powerful gang in NYC, the Grammercy Riffs, has asked nine members from the 100 most powerful gangs in New York to convene for a conclave.  The film opens as gang members make their way towards the chosen spot.  We see our heroes, the Warriors, and we're told that Cyrus is ""the one"".  Hundreds of gang members arrive wearing their ""colors"", but ""not packing"".  Unfortunately, one gang, the Rogues, is led by David Patrick Kelly as Luther, at the beginning of his film career playing psychotic criminals, and the Rogues bring a pistol to the meeting.

Cyrus stands before the assembled toughs and gives them a broad plan to form a gang alliance to stop gang warfare and begin taking over the city, one ""turf"" at a time.  Standing in the middle of a large crowd, Luther shoots Cyrus dead, and in the chaos that follows Luther loudly accuses The Warriors of murdering Cyrus.

The Warriors have come the furthest of all the gangs, from Coney Island to the Bronx, and they run for it, but not before Warrior leader Cleon is overcome by Grammercy Riffs and other gang members.  The 8 remaining Warriors are now led by Michael Beck, who looks more like a Calvin Klein model than a gang member.  The remainder of the film is about The Warriors trip back to Coney Island.  Every gang in New York is after them, fueled by a radio DJ who gives instructions and locations.  The police give chase as well.

The script is an opportunity for much macho posing.  James Remar is a hoot as Ajax, the most hot-headed Warrior, who hates the running, loves making ridiculously macho come-ons to women, and would apparently love nothing better than to beat up every gang member from one end of New York to the other.  Deborah Van Valkenburgh abandons her neighborhood gang to follow Beck and the rest of the Warriors back to Coney Island.  She serves no purpose other than to have a female character in a movie aimed squarely at an audience of testosterone-laden men.

There are many choreographed chase and fight scenes.  Several motifs recur:  In a fight any Warrior is superior to any 2 or more members of any other gang.  There are multiple scenes of outnumbered warriors battling larger numbers of other gangs, and although we're reminded that the Warriors ""aren't packing"" (in keeping with the original agreement to attend Cyrus' meeting), we see them beat up multiple other gangs who outnumber them and are armed with guns, baseball bats, etc.

Will they make it back to Coney Island?  Will it be discovered that Luther is Cyrus' real killer?  A full 5 stars on the macho meter, but I'll give it 4 overall.",1116979200,,2831,4.672727272727273

237312,4,6300213714,"The first time I saw The Warriors was during my freshman year of college when I was in one of my friend's rooms down the hall and he was watching it as one of TNT's late night specials. I immediately fell in love with this movie! What a great gang flick that has withstood the test of time.

I won't ruin the plot in case you haven't seen The Warriors yet, because you deserve to experience the film without having the fun and suspense taken from you. The movie is loaded with plenty of gangs, cops, subway scenes, colorful characters, and (at least as far as I am concerned) the single-greatest, most action-packed fight scene in cinema history involving a bathroom and roller skates.

The film drips with late 70's style in hair, music, and overall look. The cinematography is outstanding, with excellent use of New York City subway locales. Lacking a big-name cast, the acting is not bad either. Released in 1979, The Warriors went on to become both notorious and legendary. At the time of its release, crime was at epidemic proportions in New York, and critiques blasted the film as a glorification of gang violence. Efforts to ban the film were unsuccessful, however. The film has since become a cult classic and ushered in an era of movies depicting street gangs and gang life. The west coast rap trio Trest Delinquentes used the image from The Warriors' theaterical poster as the inspiration for the cover of its debut album in 1996.

As for the actual DVD edition of The Warriors, well that's a little different story. The picture quality is rather good, but all that Paramount decided to include with regards to extras was the original trailer for the film. This is quite disappointing. They really need to re-release a Collector's Edition of The Warriors which includes production notes, cast and crew interviews, and commentary regarding the political controversies surrounding this film when it was released.

There is one more disappointment with the DVD release. Why did they choose the lame cover image for the DVD case? It sucks! They need to use the cover image from the movie's theatrical poster and its VHS box. That image is a classic!

Still, all in all, The Warriors is an absolute must-have for fans of the street gang movie genre.",1114300800,2,2254,4.754475703324808

I am disappointed with this DVD release. The picture quality is anamorphic widescreen which looks great. The audio, however, is Dolby Digital Mono. I realize this is the way the original audio was recorded, but this needs to be remastered into Dolby Digital 5.1 or DTS. This soundtrack could be fantastic but sounds very flat on this DVD release. If they can remaster old low budget horror stuff like The Evil Dead into 5.1 surround they can do anything. There is no excuse not to. It would also be great to have commentaries and maybe some interviews with some of the actors. I'm sure a new release of this will be coming at some point and I will buy it on DVD again.

237315,5,6300213714,"In the late 1970's and 1980's, while most people were going to midnight movies to see The Rocky Horror Picture Show, my friends and I were going to see ""The Warriors"".  We were every bit as enthusiastic as the fans of Rocky Horror were in reciting lines and bringing props.  It was all in tribute for one of the great cult movies of the times.  Sadly The Warriors hasn't had the staying power of other cult films but remains a favoite of mine to this day.

The plot is simplistic and merely a means to set-up the fights between rival gangs.  The Gramercy Riffs, the largest gang in NY, calls a meeting in the Bronx for all the gangs to attend.  Each is to send nine members of their gang to attend the summit and a truce is declared.  Cyrus, leader of the Riffs has a plan to organize all of the gangs into one large gang to take over the city.  But not everyone likes the idea. Cyrus is shot by Luther (David Patrick Kelly), the leader of the Rogues.  One of the Warriors witnesses the shooting and the Rogues lay the blame on the Warriors.

The Cops arrive in force and the hundreds of gangbangers flee the meeting place.  The Riffs send out the word that the Warriors shot Cyrus and now every gang in the city is looking for them. To make matters worse, the Warriors leader, Cleon, is killed leaving Swan (Michael Beck) as the War Chief.  The Warriors now have to find a way to get home to Coney Island as every gang is ""looking to bust their heads"".  Swan's authority is challenged by Ajax (James Remar) who thinks he should be leader.  Meanwhile the streets are infested with gangs such as the Turnbull ACs, The Orphans, The female ""Lizzies"", and the surreal Furies, who wear baseball uniforms, paint their faces, and carry baseball bats.

The Warriors prove their toughness and resourcefulness as they head for a final showdown with The Rogues on the beaches of Coney.  This was preceded by one of the film's great cult moments when the Rogues Leader Luther puts bottles on the ends of his fingers, clicking them together and screaching out ""Warriors, Come out and Play!""  Needless to say this one of the great ""play along"" moments for viewers at midnight shows.

The film was widely condemned at the time for its violence and it was a popular film among gang members which often led to fights in the theaters.  But the violence seems rather tame compared to today's Assault rifle-toting gangs.  Rather than gritty realism Walter Hill gives us a movie that is part old-time western, and part modern day fable, not unlike Hill's ""Streets of Fire"" made a few years later.

Beck and Remar both give outstanding performances as they bicker and battle over control of the gang but David Patrick Kelly steals the show as the devious, cackling leader of the Rogues.

Word comes now that a re-make is slated for 2006 with Tony Scott as director.  Scott has directed such action films as ""Man on Fire"", ""Enemy of the State"", ""The last Boy Scout"", and ""Beverly Hills Cop 2"".  He certainly has his work cut out for him in re-making this classic cult film.",1109289600,3,3050,4.5136612021857925
237316,5,6300213714,"Especially noteworthy was the constant dialogue and interaction between the characters which brought you into the movie to experience the full effect. Beyond the legendary score and choreography, what was moving for me was the constant development and growth of the characters as they move from one territory to another, learning from each experience. As they encounter different obstacles, you get a feel for each characters style and mode. Like a good western, in order to really appreciate the movie you have to go along with some of its unrealistic, although very dramatic aspects, like gangs on roller skates and bat carrying gangs in uniform. Some of the lines and hair styles which might have been appropriate and the latest fashion at the time immediately date the movie, which easily could have been tempered.",1107043200,5,818,5.111940298507463

237319,5,6300213714,"The Warriors are a mixed-race street gang from Coney Island.  They travel 'far' to the Bronx to attend a sort of gang 'conference' arranged by one group that wants to consolidate gang power in New York and run the city.  (Yeah, this was NYC in the 70s, not Guiliani-era.)  But one gang member decides to just blow away the new leader and then pin the blame on the Warriors, for 'no reason'.  The Warriors have to fight their way back to Coney Island all night, encountering gang after gang and avoiding the (totally inept) NYPD.

Great photography, great characters, tons of style and color make this a fun movie and a cult favorite.  Apparently it provoked gang violence in movie theaters in 1979, yet it comes off as being truly from another time completely.  And of course, there are plans to remake it.  How thoughtful.  Based loosely on Sol Yurick's novel.

The DVD looks pretty good, though I have a suspicion that with the impending remake (and Yurick's book back in print) we may well see a Deluxe version in the future.  The Warriors deserve it, after all.  The film hasn't looked better.  There are some great scenes of the various gangs gearing up for the night to hunt down The Warriors.  Lots of subway action, and the film takes place almost entirely at night, with dark blacks, and rich colors for the motley gangs.

David Patrick Kelly is brilliant as Luther, the crazed Rogue gang member who looks frighteningly like Geddy Lee of Rush on a bender.  He has the famous 'Waaarriors...come out to plaaay-ay!' sequence where he clinks bottles together on his fingers over and over.'  That's acting.  The film also features another enduring quote, namely 'Can you diiiiiiiig it?!'

The Warriors is a lot of fun.  It's colorful theater, and most of the extras were dancers and were able to pull off the fluid fight scenes.  Also, the gangs are fun.  The Baseball Furies look like a cross between KISS and the NY Yankees.  And what's with the bee-colored gang with the roller-skating leader?  You know you're in 1979...

Highly recommended.  Make sure to have three empty beer bottles ready for the ending...",1102550400,9,2117,4.715846994535519

237379,5,6300213714,"As a New York kid, some movies just bring back how it all once was.  This movie is one of them as well as Taxi Driver, Saturday Night Fever and The Goodbye Girl.

While it's true that NY wasn't as decrepit as this movie portrays, it was very close.  I remember blocks upon blocks in Bklyn, Queens, Manhattan, and especially the Bronx as burnt out shells.  Landlords burned their buildings rather than take a loss in income.  Also, it was considered a viable option to have your car towed to a desolate part of NYC and blown up.  Hey, it was either that and collect comp insurance or let the repo man get it.  Also the trains really were scary.  The train near me was the IRT (numbered trains from 1 to 5).  You did not ride these trains unless it was during rush hour or you were with a large group of friends.  The trains were covered in grafiti, filthy and the lights did not work.  You could ride to and from NYC and be sitting in the dark 75% of the time. Also the stations were the habitat of the homeless and gang kids.  42nd Street was also a notorious red-light district but that never seemed to be an issue with us New Yorkers.  We laughed about it.

Anyway, this film is a landmark film on street kids, gang culture and 70's NY.  It's campy, true, but back then almost every New Yorker dressed like a refugee of Studio 54 and the Mudd Club.  The gangs represent a drugged out, punk rock version of lower class hell (By the way, Punk Rock was a New York invention, London stole it from us).  The Baseball Furies, in particular, scared the living daylights out of me.  You can imagine the mess I was in when Halloween came around and everyone was a Baseball Fury.  I loved the fact that the gangs were a mix mashup of all kinds of kids.  All of whom had one allegiance, to perpetuating neighborhood turf wars, everything else (gender and race) came afterwards.

This film launched the careers of James Remarr, Michael Beck, Mercedes Ruehl, David Patrick Kelly and Deborah Van Valkenburgh.  Valkenburgh's performance in particular is affecting.  She was one of the glamorous tv stars and in this film she was covered in dirt.  One of the best scenes is when she comes face to face with rich prom kids on the train.  She tries to tidy herself up but Beck's Swan stops her.  It captures NY class warfare at it's most brutal.

The soundtrack is, of course, fantastic.

I shudder over the remake news.  This film is, was and always will be about New York.  Now they will take it and turn it into some moralistic, stylistic, car ad to sell us junk.  How depressing.",1099958400,,2567,4.375

237381,5,6300213714,"""The Warriors"" is a fantasy film.  If you try to judge it in relation to the real world, you're wasting your time.  It takes place in an alternate universe.  In this world, street gangs don't traffic in drugs, they only fight against each other and never target innocent civilians, and they wear colorful costumes like in ""A Clockwork Orange"".  They also fight with knives and chains rather than AK-47s.  You know early on the David Patrick Kelly is the villian, because he uses a handgun, a clear violation of the gangbangers' civilaric code.

If you accept this alternate reality, ""The Warriors"" is a great adventure movie.  In my opinion it the best film that Walter Hill ever made.  I love the various street gangs which include:

The Thermal ACs, who are skinheads, but not racist, since they also have black members.

The Furies, who dress up like baseball players with clown makeup.

The Riffs, who seem to pattern themselves after Jim Kelly from ""Enter The Dragon"".

An unnamed gang who dress in the style of 70s roller disco (not really scary; rollerskates are definately something you don't want to be wearing during a rumble).

The Orphans, a gang of losers who want respect but are too chicken to earn it.

The Lizzies, and gang of man-hating lesbians who pretend to be loose in order to lead male gang-members to their doom (think Homer's ""The Odyssey"").

The Rogues, who are led by a sadistic psychopath (who also has the best lines in the entire movie, including the classic, ""warriors, come out to play...!""

This is the ultimate cult classic: Walter Hill's controversial ""The Warriors"" is insanely addictive in repeated viewings, thanks to its compelling plot and creative characters.

A gang-the Warriors, natch-are framed for murdering a rival top gang leader, putting a price on each gang member's head in the process. The gang must make way to their Coney Island sanctuary before dawn least they get popped. Like Homer's ""Odyssey"", they meet a varied assortment of quirky people and bloodthirsty gangs along the journey, barely escaping peril along the way. If that doesn't interest you, you're cleary not an action movie fan.

Such a great flick deserves a special edition dvd; unfortunately, Paramount merely released a bare-bones dvd with a ho-hum packaging (if they ever do a special edition set, they just have to have the original cool ""They're out to get the Warriors"" poster to serve as the cover). Only the sleek theatrical trailer is included as an extra. Even the menu screen stinks. Paramount, please, give ""the Warriors"" fans the true special edition dvd they deserve! You will make $$$!

That said, I sure hate to see this movie being remade today; they'd probably make it all ""bling-bling"" and have Ja Rule play Swan or something. So catch this movie before McG gets his ruddy paws on it.

Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to strut on the beach while Joe Walsh's ""In the City"" is played in the background.",1094515200,3,1560,5.101960784313725
237384,5,6300213714,"One Of The Top 3 NYC Street Gang movies of all time,very action packed and true to life in some aspects. This film sparked alot of violent incidents all over the place. The movie captured the NYC Gang Culture as it sort of was in NY during the late 70's. If your into films about NYC Street Gangs then this is the one to buy! My only complaint is that the DVD doesn't included deleted scenes,commentary,or photo gallery. I would hope that in the near future the Paramount Company rerelease the DVD with the above included. If you buy this movie also buy The Warriors Book by Sol Yurick. Another Realistic NYC Street Gang Film is Defiance shot in 1979 also in Lower Manhattan. The DVD of this film is not out yet but I think you can get it on VHS.In The End The Warriors is a must buy despite the weak DVD version! I can't wait for the new Playstation 2 game The Warriors from rockstar games due to be released in Jan,2005 along side The Warriors Remake.",1091059200,2,953,4.3
237385,5,6300213714,"I will buy this movie on DVD because it is a classic. Maybe it was ahead of its time - certainly, gangs are an increasing threat to society and its suburban dreams and hopes. Not all gang members are easily rejected and despised; some are just pathetic. Nonetheless, gangs kill innocent folk. "" The Warriors"" have members with whom you empathize. It's a fascinating juxtaposition of love and hate.

 "" The Warriors rule;"" the Orphans are pathetic.

 This film explores a code of ethics and conduct which are often pissed upon by today's so-called, civilized society; Wall Steet is an example. There is a fascinating duality of violence and survival, pride versus arrogance...the Baseball Furries get their just desserts...

 It is superbly edited. The sound track is phenomenal. "" The Warriors"" is a classic film which deserve its day in the spotlight - even if the spotlight is in Coney Island.

 Oh, did I forget to mention the fight sequences? This film will get you psyched for some ""boppin'""

237386,5,6300213714,"LMAO....This movie owned badly.  It came out a long time ago, but I saw it on DVD about a month ago.  Gangs from the 70's are sooooooooo much different than gangs today.  Like we might have bloods, and crips today.  But the gangs back then actually had meaning, and a concept.  A nice example is the Orphans.  They all dressed up in raggidy !@# clothing, and kept to themselves.  They had a gang like, they all dressed up in baseball uniforms, and wielded bats as weapons.  Also, guns were rare back then.  I mean some people had guns, but when the term ""Are you packing"" was said, people had whatever they can fight with.  2X4, Bath, Pipes, Bricks.  Thats real....lol",1089244800,,668,4.483333333333333
237387,4,6300213714,"It is difficult to take Walter Hill's 1979 classic ""The Warriors"" seriously today. Ostensibly a picture about various street gangs in New York City, the movie paints a rather quaint, almost cartoonish portrait of crime in the Big Apple. I knew from the start the movie wasn't going to give us a gritty interpretation of the thug lifestyle. Why? A gang traveling to a big summit in the Bronx takes time out of their busy schedule to purchase and then feed subway tokens into the turnstile so all the members can board the train. How's that for a big, bad group of street goons? I imagine now that a gang doing this would be marked for extermination just on the principle of the thing. Still, that doesn't mean ""The Warriors"" isn't entertaining; it is, massively so. It's so entertaining, and made such a big splash at the time, that Italian filmmakers began ripping it off in their low budget films. ""The Bronx Warriors,"" for example, contains several scenes obviously lifted from this movie. The only difference is that Hill's movie manages to work despite its flaws while the Italian effort looks unconvincingly cheesy. Whatever your take on this movie, we must admit it has been influential.
The plot is simplicity itself. A gang from Coney Island called the Warriors gets an invite to attend a massive rally twenty-seven miles away. All the big gangs in the city will be there, including the Riffs, the most powerful band of street thugs in New York. The leader of the Riffs, Cyrus, plans to consolidate the various crews of street criminals under his benevolent rule. Through a mix of charisma and charged oratory-lots of ""can you dig it"" thrown around for the benefit of the goons-Cyrus brings the crowd to its feet. Unfortunately for him and for the Warriors, Luther (David Patrick Kelly), with his gang called the Rogues, assassinates Cyrus in the middle of his speech. In the resulting chaos the Warriors take the blame for the murder. Even worse, the leader of the Warriors, Cleon (Dorsey Wright) falls in the resulting melee. The rest of the Warriors make a run for it, now with Swan (Michael Beck) leading the gang. Every street thug in the city wants a piece of the Warriors, especially the Riffs. Swan and his crew must make it back to Coney Island before falling prey to the Turnbull AC's, the Lizzies, the Orphans, the Baseball Furies, the Boppers, the Rogues, and a hundred other gangs big and small. Too, the men in blue wish to ask the Warriors a few questions about Cyrus's sudden demise.
The rest of the film recounts the Warriors' journey home. Their efforts center on the subway, but everyone else knows this is the method the hunted crew will take. Every time the Warriors finally get on a train, some incident arises that stops them cold. A fire on the track forces the crew to make their way to the next train on foot, opening them up to the murderous retribution of the other gangs. In one neighborhood, our heroes run up against a ""minor league"" gang called the Orphans and a mouthy harridan named Mercy (Deborah Van Valkenburgh), and must battle their way free. An encounter with the cops at the subway forces the Warriors to split up. Eventually, a few of the members fall prey to other gangs, to the police, or narrowly escape doom at the hands of knife and gun wielding women. As if things couldn't get worse, a radio disc jockey (Lynne Thigpen) sends out artfully coded messages about the location of the Warriors, thereby urging other thugs to join in the free for all. Will the surviving members of the Warriors get home in the end? And will it really matter if they do?
Xenophon's ""Anabasis,"" the tale of a band of Greeks caught behind Persian lines that had to battle their way back home, forms the basis of Hill's ""The Warriors."" Everything from naming the king of the gangs Cyrus to the final showdown on the beach comes right out of this ancient Greek text. Most viewers won't know this of course (I didn't at first; I read it somewhere), but would be content to merely sit back and watch the antics unfold. You've got gang members dressed like baseball players with painted faces swinging bats in a park, the leader of the Orphans looks like Eric Bogosian with a hangover, and plot holes run through this movie like subway tunnels. The flaws in ""The Warriors"" are epic in scope. Why, for instance, doesn't the gang simply take a cab or steal a car and get home in a hurry? Are we to assume that a street gang has no money to hire a driver or the ability to hotwire an automobile? Some hoods these guys are! Too, I always thought New York City is the town that never sleeps. Well, the denizens of the Big Apple snoozed the night away when this film was made. No one appears on the streets, no cars drive by, and no one comes out of their apartment buildings to see what's going on. And if the police are so interested in stopping the Warriors, why not just stop the trains from running? It's to the film's credit that despite myriad plot problems, ""The Warriors"" still works.
The DVD's picture transfer looks great. Unfortunately, it is a Paramount release with only a trailer as an extra. That's right; no commentary, interviews, behind the scenes fun, or anything else diehard fans would like to see. While I can't say this is my favorite movie, many people swear by it. It's another example of the larger problem with Paramount's DVD department. ""The Warriors,"" despite Paramount's lack of attention, is a must have for fans of cult classics.",1087689600,85,5484,4.625641025641026
237451,4,6300213714,"It's hard to imagine it now but when The Warriors first came out in '79 it was hugely controversial. Some theaters refused to show the movie because they feared arson and gang activity. Others were afraid that it might give disaffected teens crazy ideas but the word of mouth on the movie was so strong people just had to see it.
Okay, it's got some flaws. Most gangs weren't muliracial back then and they certainly aren't now. NYC is a tough town but even back in the 70s it wasn't the absolute hell hole depicted in the movie and since when do gangs get their marching orders from thelocal radio stations?
Those are just tiny quibbles. Sit back and enjoy. Michael Beck played the role of his career as Swan, the leader of the Warriors a small Coney Island gang who head way up town to attend the city's biggest gang summit. Cyrus (Can you dig it?) wants to put aside petty differences and form one big super gang but he's cut down but a vicious and annoying little weasel who blames Swan's gang for the killing. The rest of the movie has the Warriors trying to get home. They run for their lives through what looks like miles of empty(!) New York streets pursued by every gang, large, small and minor league in town.
At one point the trip started reminding me of Odyseus coming home from Troy. They run into one danger after another including two traps in the forms of females. Ajax, like the Greek fighter from Troy is strong, brave but dumber than a box of rocks and he blunders into one of the biggest surprises of the night. Other members of the group run into a group of cute girls and go merrily to a party that almost turns out the be their last and Swan, like Odyseus ends up with his own version of the ever faithful Penelope.
I was 10 when I saw the Warriors and came away with a couple of useful tidbits :
1. Don't take the subway. There's a war zone down there.
2. If you see a guy in a heavy makeup and a baseball uniform at midnight, run for your life.
3. Listen to the radio. They might be talking about you.
4. On big gang movement nights the citizens of New York go to bed early and don't come out again until the next morning to clean up the bodies.
5. That red spot in the sand really is blood.
The Warriors is funny, a little sad and still after all these years it's the movie equivalent of an amusement park ride. It's not War & Peace but it is a cult classic and once you watch it if you have any kind of sense of humor you'll really dig it.",1085788800,5,2465,4.2025316455696204

COME OUT AND PLAY-AYYYYYY... WAHHHHHHHRIORS... COME OUT AND PLAY-AYYYYYYY... thing, even with the bottles... in Japanese... aside from being strange though it made one thing clear...  Even in Japan, where action type films and animation are taken very seriously, THE WARRIORS is considered a classic... Though its true that the DVD lacks many extras (*commentary would have been great, or even alt takes, deleted scenes, making of info, or even the news reports about the ""riots"" and controversy the film ignited) the fact that you can actually watch your favorite scenes at the flick of a button even without many extras, makes the Dvd well worth the purchase... (*Can youuuuuuuuu dig it !)  - - Though I'm still disappointed that dispite all the ridiculous gang get ups and uniforms they didn't have a gang dressed up like Orthodox Jewish Rabbis or Ballerinas... The Riffs, Lizzies and Turnball ACs more than made up for it... not to mention the rockin' soundtrack.
The Warriors is more than just a film... like THE WALL and ROCKY HORROR its just one of those late night films you watch with your buddies over... and over... and over... and over again... (or even annoy them by quoting from whenever the opportunity arrives...)

The Warriors finds a gang attempting to get across 27 miles of enemy gang territory until they reach their home of beautiful Coney Island.
Also, every other gang in New York is on their tale (having been set up for murdering the leader of a conference trying to establish peace, so the gangs can overtake the cops, and rule the city - don't worry, this is all during the opening credits).
Considering how different each gang had to be, the director just went nuts. My personal favorite is the ""Baseball Furies"" (think of the Yankees + Kiss).
And while it is actually filmed in New York, it isn't 100% geographically accurate (the 72nd st 1/2/3/9 line is used as 96th st - but it comes pretty close. Union Square actually is Union Square (he's running up the steps of the 4/5/6 platform - I should know, I live there....no, not on the tracks)

That really makes me mad, I almost gave this 4 stars but the movie still covers it. This film was based on the novel by Sol Yurick. There is really not much story to this film. There is just dozens and dozens of memorable quotes like ""Warriors, come out and play-yaa"". This film just shows the massive destruction of gangs. How gangs react, and the rules of being a gang member. How each gang has their own territory.
This film has been known by it massive destruction of chaos, proving anarchy did once exist. By its brutal battles and cinematography. For a film with not much of a plot, only the fact that this shows the life of a gang member, this is a great film. Performances are really great too.

237455,5,6300213714,"OK suckahs, it goes down like this.  This flick has it all goin' on.  See there's this dude, calls himself Cyrus, who get all the big gangs of NYC to send a group of nine soldiers each to a big powow in Central Park.  See, Cyrus thinks that if the gangs all band together, they can form a SuperGang and take over the whole city.  Cyrus has the chops, but one crazy dude, Luther (played by David Patrick Kelley, a familiar heavy if you like this kind of flick) shoots him.  Dead, can you dig it?
Then chaos erupts and during it all, Luther spots one of the Warriors and screams out it was the Warriors who japped Cyrus.  This leads to the meat of the flick which involves the Warriors trying to make it back to Coney Island, their home turf, alive.
Michael Beck, in what arguably was his only intelligent decision in his acting career (Megaforce, Xanadu) plays Swan, the sudden leader after The Warriors' warlord goes down in the park.  James Remar, who has become a familiar face over the years plays Ajax, a single-minded lackey to Beck.  One of the best scenes in the movie, IMO, is when Ajax gets his due.
The other gangs are a mix of believable gangs and some gangs who like that stepped off of a chorus line in some Broadway gig.  I refer here to the Baseball Furies, who wear white pasty make-up and Yankee threads.  The climax of the movie is worth the wait.  Jimjam sez check it out.",1081036800,,1391,4.311538461538461
237456,5,6300213714,"Every gang in the city must be looking for us! An understatement if I've ever heard one. From the moment the opening ""Warriors"" logo appears and the train sequence starts, I still feel a rush of adrenaline run through me. A sleeper hit from 1979 and highly controversial at the time, the ""Warriors"" is definitely a cult classic with an enormous following. It's too bad that some of the original opening scenes on the ""Warriors"" turf are still missing even in this Director's Cut DVD version.

For the Director's cut DVD the picture has been remastered, it's crystal clear and the newly upgraded sound is a definite improvement over the previous DVD release. Given its memorable soundtrack it should have always been in 5.1 Dolby Digital. In my opinion the new 5.1 soundtrack definitely enhances the fight and chase scenes as well as the overall mood of the film. To this day my favorite scenes are still the chase with the Turnbull AC's and the memorable fight with the Baseball Furies, these guys were very menacing looking and they swung a mean bat.

It appears that Paramount Studios finally convinced Walter Hill to revisit his work and make some needed upgrades for the fans. The Director's Cut now contains an introduction and some extra frames giving the movie a comic book feel in certain scenes. The special features this time around include four short documentaries; basically one documentary broken into four parts. Also included are interviews with Director Walter Hill, actors Michael Beck, James Remar, David Patrick Kelly, and Deborah Van Valkenburgh. The DVD includes In-depth descriptions of how the movie evolved and are recounted by the producer, cinematographer, costume designer, stunt coordinator and many others.

After 29 years of repeated viewing, this movie is still a classic for me and worthy of a place in my DVD collection. I've never seen another gang film like the ""Warriors"" and I give it 5 stars for pure entertainment. You ""Warriors"" are good, real good!

237457,4,6300213714,"""The Warriors"" starring Michael Beck is a street gang version of a Navy shore leave gone horribly wrong.  The Warriors are a nine-member Coney Island street gang that take the train to the Bronx under a flag of truce.  They are attending a New York Citywide gang powwow -- their first trip out of Coney Island.  Cyrus, the largest NYC gang's leader, is assassinated at the powwow and the assassins blame the Warriors.  The Warriors must fight their way back to Coney Island chased by the New York City Police and every other New York City street gang.
""The Warriors"" is a testosterone-filled cult film that concentrates on the gang members' return odyssey.  The Warriors are unarmed and outnumbered, and everybody wants to play -- fists, chains, clubs, knives and guns.  The Warriors' caution is tempered by the exhilaration of new places -- exhilaration that brings additional trouble.
Citywide street gang unity is an interesting and significant film theme (""An American Mogadishu""?).  This 1979 film features street gang coordination over a gang-run FM broadcast radio station.  Speculating how today's street gangs use Internet-accessible text-enabled cellular telephones and Internet chat rooms is interesting.
IMO ""The Warriors"" is a heroic epic film.  And IMO ""The Warriors"" is less violent than traditional Western or war films, ""Buffy The Vampire Slayer"" or other common 21st Century television fare.",1075939200,4,1409,5.254464285714286

237526,5,6300213714,"This film is an insane hybrid of ""Clockwork Orange"", ""West Side Story"", and Greek mythology!  More than typical action fare, ""The Warriors"" is really a dystopic thinly disguised as an update to a classical tale, Xenophon's ""Anabasis.""  To the more casual viewer, it's one of the most underrated action films of the late 1970s.
Set in a bleak, alternate New York circa 1978, ""The Warriors"" almost instantly immerses its audience in a bizarre reality.  It is, of course, a gang film. The plot is simple; a gang separated from its leader treks through dangerous territory to return to their home turf.  Complicating matters, they are falsely accused of murder and are pursued by every rival gang in the city.  There do not appear to be any adults or ""civilians"", or any other non-gang faction.  There are police, but they are just another gang themselves.
What is really unusual is the depth of this alternate world, and how quickly it engages the viewer.  Three minutes into the film, the viewer is led to believe that a 1970s New York gang would willingly dress up as purple pimps!  Another gang is made up as mimes, AND look menacing at the same time. The most over-the-top gangs are the multiracial skinheads (!) and the clown-faced baseball-bat wielding Baseball Furies.  The language is almost completely invented for this film and by the end is second-nature to the viewer.  There are many references to the classics - from the ""chorus"" (a faceless DJ calling the action) to the aforementioned ""furies"".  It sounds bizarre...but it works, and it's very engaging.
Unfortunately, ""The Warriors"" did not achieve widespread recognition due to an inexplicable campaign to suppress it during its theatrical run.  Rumors about alleged gang violence at theaters led to a quick demise, only to be resurrected as a cult film at midnight showings and on cable during the early 1980s.  Anyone who thinks ""The Warriors"" resembles modern youth culture has clearly been asleep for the last 20 years.  One only needs to witness the jaw-dropping Purple Pimps and the Menacing Mimes to realize this.
It's violent, but relatively bloodless.  The most lethal weapons are fists, bats, and chains.  It's one of the most creative films, and Walter Hill's vision was risky.  It works, and it even holds up well after 24 years.
Watch for the extensive use of NYC subways (though not always geographically accurate), and the 1978 anachorisms - in the background a sharp-eyed viewer can see posters for ""Foul Play"", ""Heaven Can Wait"", and ""Grease"".
Great DVD and a fascinating film, hightly recommended.",1047686400,10,2580,4.976689976689976

I'm writing this review as I saw it and the way it made me feel at fifteen years old, although I just watched it again on a movie channel and it still brings back those feelings. The Warriors are blamed for something they didn't do and are on the run from every other gang in New York. To see what some of these gangs look like and what they are called is just mesmurizing to me. You really begin to hope they make their final destination to their turf. Fine acting, all around, and at least rent this movie if you don't buy it. I'm guessing after you rent it you'll want to buy it for your collection anayway.",1043798400,,881,3.955056179775281
237528,5,6300213714,"Are you kidding me? Is there anything better than this movie?
Easily one of the saddest career trajectories in American movies, Walter Hill probably peaked with this absolute gem of a gangland melodrama, cementing his place next to Sam Fuller in the pantheon of genre filmmakers who probably could've been contenders (ok, yeah he directed '48 hrs.' but look at everything that followed). In a lot of ways, we're exploring the same type of post-apocalyptic, pre-Rudy Giuliani, hyperdrive New York City that John Schlesinger explored in ""Midnight Cowboy"" and Martin Scorsese tackled in ""Taxi Driver"". Except WAY cheesier.
It's impossible to know what to like best in this film: Mercedes Ruehl as a skanky undercover cop? The Baseball Furies? The Lizzies? James Remar? The 'So-far-down-they-aren't-even-on-the-map' Orphans?
What's amazing is, for all the crazy, whacked-out, cheesy elements, it hangs together brilliantly, and the social commentary comes through loud and clear. The soundtrack and costumes also kick heinie.
But anyway, see this movie on DVD, even if the transfer doesn't do it any justice.

The film was contoversial in 1979 when it was released, but it is good campy fun. I first saw it on Halloween on HBO in 1980 when I was in sixth grade.

237564,5,6300213714,"""The Warriors"" is perhaps the definitive cult film -- a flick you always enjoy seeing again.
The story is about a Coney Island gang that gets wrongly accused of murder and must make it back home from the Bronx, fighting enemy gangs and police all the way.
The 'feel' of the movie is part surreal, part realistic and wholly captivating!
... ""The Warriors"" is just a great flick full of memorable scenes and lines. I really love the ending where, after being vindicated, the Warriors walk down the Coney Island beach while the DJ offers them a tribute song -- ""Survival In the City"" by Walsh/Eagles.
I also like the fact that the Warriors is a racially mixed gang -- a group of lost souls in the urban jungle, banded together perhaps for no other reason except for the obvious fact that they're from the same urban cesspool and have a need to belong.
I stated that the movie is part realistic, but only in the sense that it never becomes campy; the creators and cast properly take it all quite serious. Other than that, the flick showcases a mesmerizing fantastical New York City, that could never be mistaken for reality.",1029628800,,1120,4.577114427860696

237608,5,6300213714,"A city-wide truce has been called so that nine representatives of each of NY's thousands of warring street gangs can get to a kind of conference. In the claustrophobic precincts of a torch-lit park up in the Bronx at dead of night, the leader of NY's most powerful gang invites them to join together - an army of a hundred thousand soldiers - to take control of the city. At the height of his speech he is gunned down by a teenage psychopath who successfully pins the blame on The Warriors, a gang up from Coney Island. At that point the rally is broken up by riot police, and the Warriors have to make it the length of New York City back to their home turf through enemy-occupied territory. Not only are the police out in force to pick up stray gang-members; the successor to the assassinated leader has put a price on the Warriors' heads, and every gang in the city is combing the streets for them.
Walter Hill's 1979 movie was based on a very downbeat novel by Sol Yurick, which was itself loosely based on an ancient Greek legend about a group of soldiers fighting their way home across enemy territory. It may not sound a promising formula, but Walter Hill turned it into one of the most entertaining and uplifting films of its decade and perhaps of his career. His successful strategy was to turn his back on the depressing realism of the book. Although the basic story-line and setting are from Yurick's novel, Hill turned to the original Greek tale for the broader atmosphere and moral tone of the film. Whereas Yurick was essentially writing about the dehumanising effects of peer group pressure and dysfunctional family life, Hill made a film about mutual trust and teamwork under pressure. You may not approve of his heroes - they are innocent of the main crime they are accused of but probably guilty of almost everything else imaginable - but you can hardly fail to root for them as the whole of New York is out for their blood and they are forced to find strengths they would never have suspected they possessed. They don't all make it home, of course, but for those who do it's a story of growing up in one night.
This could have been just another street-fighting movie, but it was made with humour, sympathy and affection long before the genre was popularised by computer games and its conventions became cast in stone. Some of the gangs out to get the Warriors are just soulless thugs, but others are real people struggling with poverty, self-esteem and their sense of belonging. There is a certain amount of mostly well-choreographed violence, but it is all pretty cartoonish and violence is the last thing the film is really about. The real theme is group dynamics: who will take the lead, who will follow, who will rebel, who will be sacrificed, who will end up older and wiser. And if this sounds boring, remember that when the film was first released it sparked riots in NY theatres.
The film boasts some fine character performances by young actors who have since gone on to wider acclaim, notably James Remar and David Patrick Kelly. It is crammed with memorable lines and unforgettable visual images, and a special word is required on its inspired use of the New York Subway - moody, dark, mysterious, enticing, threatening, Freudian. The trains constantly rushing through, scarred with graffiti, coming from and going to nowhere, are often a means of advancing the story, but they are so much more than that: Stopping and starting without warning, sometimes in the nick of time, sometimes a moment too late, they are a metaphor for the uncontrollable and fickle world in which the characters live. And just as often they seem to symbolise the world outside the tiny living space of these alienated kids and beyond their reach. The stations and tunnels are sometimes a protective womb, sometimes a battleground. We see no drivers, no ticket clerks, or indeed any humanising faces apart from the threatening presence of police officers prowling back and forth like monsters in a computer game - bump into one and you lose a life.
In the end Hill cannot resist moralising a little: The blossoming gotta-get-out-of-this-place romance between the alpha-male Swan and Mercy, a tough/fragile runaway girl who falls in with the gang initially just for kicks. The taut and delicately directed confrontation with a handful of ""legitimate"" middle-class passenger on the train. The despairing line (""Is this what we fought all night to get back to?"") as the surviving members of the gang emerge from the night train onto the grimy elevated station at Coney Island, and survey their home turf in the cruel honesty of dawn's early light. These sentiments are not just slightly clumsy; they betray a mildly patronising middle-class pity on the film-makers' part for the characters they themselves created. But paradoxically, this very flaw contributes to the film's success. There has been no shortage of gritty real-life streetwise film-making, and the depressing earnestness of that sort of film can deter the very audience that most needs to be woken up by it. In contrast, this film that has been made purely for entertainment, with no cold sadistic violence, no prostitution and most remarkably of all no drugs, doesn't put up any barriers of revulsion. And it does not date, because the stylized cityscapes and costumes do not belong to any specific era. Thus it gets right under your skin and very subtly gives a transforming glimpse of the dark side of urban life and the humanity that we share with even its most exotic life-forms. That's probably why ""The Warriors"" sparked off riots on its first release, and perhaps that's why it seems to get even better with age.",1023235200,12,5686,4.791242362525458

All of the actors do a great job, even if some of the dialogue is of its day--but James Remar as 'Ajax' and Michael Beck's 'Swan' are particular stand-outs as the typical street hood with a chip on his shoulder, and the disillusioned, somewhat idealistic gang leader, respectively.

As a film, it doesn't really bring much to the table: Sirus, who seems to be gangdoms' messiah, holds a rally in the Bronx to unite the citys gangs. While he mentions the potential power they would possess working in unison he doesn't get into any detail (will they have a dental plan?)
Of course, he gets killed from the get-go. The rest of the film plays like a poor mans 'Fugitive', following the Warriors back to Coney Island through dark and dangerous territioies filled with rival gangs like...the Orphans. Heh.
In the end we find out who's really behind Sirus's death, and they get thier just rewards. It's a predictable whodunit.
Most of the gang depictions are a joke; I'd put my money on the Crazy Homicides or Savage Nomads against any of these groups. I half expected them to break out in dance at any moment.

The story line is simple which adds to the film's good flavor. The Warriors are wrongly accused and sent on the run. They must dodge and go through several different gangs and police to get home. The leader of the Warriors is played by Michael Beck(Alcatraz-The Whole Shocking Story,Triumphs of a Man Called Horse) who delivers an excellent performance as the quiet yet tough Swan. Also adding a lot to the film's attraction is the trouble-hungry character, Ajax, played convincingly by James Remar. Swan and Ajax provide an excellent contrast within the Warriors. Mercedes Ruehl also makes a short yet memorable appearance. The many different types of gangs are really fun to watch. To me, this movie has it all, action, drama, and even a small touch of romance. I highly recommend this film. If you haven't seen this film, I suggest making a night of it. I first saw this movie when I was 8 years old.

237659,5,6300213714,"Another one of Joe Bob Briggs' Monstervision classics, ""The Warriors"" revolves around the struggle of nine gang members trying to escape the Bronx and reach their home turf of Coney Island. Along the way they run into countless obstacles that threaten to keep them from attaining their goal such as police, subway fires, and rival gangs. Okay, so it's not ""Escape from New York"" or even ""Judgement Night"" but it's still pretty good.
The best part of ""The Warriors"" are the gangs. Every gang has a gimmick such as the Coney Island Warriors of the title who's ""colors"" consist of stereotypical Native-American garb, i.e. leather vests and pants and even in some cases headdress. Another example are the High Hats who all dress as street mimes. My personal favorites,though,are the Furies who walk the streets in baseball uniforms with their gang logo on the back and ridiculous face paint.
The dialog is quite entertaining at times. The gangs all have their own lingo which doesn't even seem to coincide with the parlance of the times. The film appears to take place in an indeterminate time period and the dialog, as well as the nature of the gangs themselves, would seem to support that theory. I guess the overall consensus is that this could take place in any city at any time. Leaves one to wonder if Walter Hill took his influence straight from Anthony Burgess' ""A Clockwork Orange"".
""The Warriors"" though never truly gripping is still a good movie. Some of its elements over time have devolved into camp but on the whole it has survived pretty well.

237705,5,6300213714,"Walter Hills 1979 Gang opus ""The Warriors"" is one of my all-time favourite films. Having first seen it at the tender age of ten and some forty times since, it's power to entertain, thrill and delight me has not been deminished over the years. The story of a NYC youth gang crossing rival turfs in a bid to ""make it back"" home after being unfairly blamed for a rival gangleaders death enables this film to move at breakneck pace and cover a variety of terrains and situations that are rendered semi-real and at the same time semi-surrealistically greatly adding to the atmosphere of the film.
This atmosphere is perfectly conveyed right from the beginning of the film with the weird blinking lights of the Wonder Wheel ferris wheel coupled with the equally haunting and weird sound of Barry De Vorzen's synth music. NYC is set up as some kinda errie playground for these gangs (indeed maybe a larger Coney Island)and you know you're gonna see some fights and some freaks. As the credits roll in perfect time with the music (as indeed most of the film moves exactly with the music), this promise is already being partly fulfilled, as we are treated to the sight of some of the most laughable and at the same time scary gangs you'll ever see. The enormity of NYC is conveyed through the use of train maps and the sheer variety of the gangs and you know that the Warriors are gonna be running into more than one of 'em.
Following the gang meeting and the final plot lynchpins (all within the first ten minutes), the chase is on, and what a ride director Walter Hill takes you on! Through problem after problem, gang after gang, turf after turf, fight after fight and several character enhancing/detracting moments for the members of the Warriors the film rarely lets up, and while some bits seem overly simplistic, silly or both, you couldn't give a Van Damn because it's all done with such style and speed.
This was Walter Hill's third film, after debuting with ""Streetfighter"" AKA ""Hardtimes"" and then ""The Driver"" (which was also quite influential in its own way - just check ""Driver"" the game), and the experience he gained on these films must have helped contribute to the grand experience that this is. Atmosphere and ideas count for a hell of a lot in my book, and this film just ooozes both. The different look of each of the gangs is awesome, from the face-painted baseball furies, the skinhead AC Turnballs, the redneck Jim Morrison wannabes, and the pathetic Orphans with their equally pathetic green tee-shirts, each gang gets the outfit they deserve. The location shooting by mega-talented Lazlo Kovaks bursts outta your screen with neon colour and feeling, you can taste the smoke of the train station fire, or smell the P**s in the subway toilets. You feel as if your there, and at the same time it's so surrealistic you know it's a film. It's a weird combo and it works.
This film has become rather infamous, partly due to the violent incidents that occurred during its first run. A shooting death at a drive-in between two gangs, a kidnap/beating, and uh... possibly another shooting death somewhere. Another reason for its infamy may reside in the fact that it has been extensively sampled (check a variety of Drum 'n' Bass tunes, PWEI track etc), referenced (eg. NWA's 100 Miles and Running), or directly ripped off (eg. the slew of early 80s gang movies that tries to copy its formula ""1990: The Bronx Warriors). The thing is the film evidently hit enough nerves to stay in people's minds.
The DVD is somewhat of a mixed bag. First of all WHOOOO HOOOOO it's out on DVD, it's widescreen and it is AMAZINGLY cleaned up. I've been waiting to see it as the theater intended for years and years and years. At the same time, Paramount have gone their traditional route of a pathetic number of chapter stops and an equally pathetic number of extras. What extras? The trailer  (which is damn cool, has music that isn't in the film or soundtrack, and one or two shots and lines that I don't recall being in the film). However, for a film like this that does have a substantial cult following, I would have thought Paramount could have found extra scenes, a featurette and especially a director's commentary. I would have loved to have heard stuff about the making of this film, like real gangs threatening the crew or something, and seeing that many of the actors etc here (great as they are, especially James Remar) aren't doing as much of late I'm sure they would have been up for it. Similarly the cover artwork, utilises about three photos again and again, when the original Australian video release (and all subsequent ones for that matter) had that awesome painting of all the gangs posing together as one big ""family"". Ah well, at least the disc itself looks cool.
Still I'm as pleased as punch to finally have this film in my DVD collection, I have been awaiting its release since the moment I got my player and just having this film remastered in widescreen is ultimately good enough for me, as I know I ain't gonna wear out this copy watching it 45 times or so, as I did with my VHS. The Warriors weren't just good, real good...they're the best.",980899200,2,5162,4.641530054644809
237706,4,6300213714,"Even though it was made in 1979, Walter Hill's 'The Warriors' is still enjoyable to watch.  This well-made film deals with many issues that are common with today's urban gangs.  It does glorify it a lot but it does make you think.
I heard about gang violence breaking out when 'The Warriors' was originally released in theatres.  In 1988, there was talk about gang riots being associated with the release of the film 'Colors'.  I think it was nothing but a publicity stunt.
I'm glad that this film along with with past great films are being released on DVD.  There is one thing that disappoints me:
The film has an aspect of 1:85.1 even though the widescreen aspect ratio is described as 'anamorphic'.",980812800,,701,4.666666666666667
237707,5,6300213714,"""The Warriors"" is not your average mind-numbing action flick in that it has a good story and well-developed characters. The acting is actually pretty decent, too (look for a young Mercedes Ruehl). I was introduced to this movie only a few years ago, but it immediately became a much-beloved member of my extensive video collection.  Since then, I have screened this movie for various people and the response is unanimous - awesome!!
The result of viewing this movie repeatedly with friends is almost always the same: if you watch this at party, count the minutes until slips their fingers into three beer bottles, clinks them together and chants ""Warriors...come out to plaa-aay!""  And I dare you to listen to Joe Walsh's ""In the City"" ever again without conjuring up memories of this cool movie.
Joe Bob Briggs used to play this frequently on TNT's MonsterVision. I always wondered why until I finally watched the entire movie and was stunned at the heavy feeling of suspense I felt as the condemened Warriors were stalked through the gritty, dangerous (eerie?) streets of New York City in the dead of night.  This is by no means a horror movie; however, the pervasive fear and anxiety that runs rampant throughout the film is enough to induce extensive nail-bighting. (One is almost reminded of another attempt at this urban horror scenario in 1993's ""Judgement Night"" with Cuba Gooding Jr and Emilio Estevez).
For all of you undecided viewers out there, I highly recommend The Warriors.  This one has become one of my favorite late-Saturday-night video staples.  And if you, like me, are a fan of gritty New York street movies (i.e Taxi Driver), this one definitely deserves space on your video shelf. It is an action/suspense classic and one that you will enjoy for years to come.

""The Warriors"" is a story about the street gang subculture in New York, circa the early 1980's.  The point of focus is a street gang called ""The Warriors"", who were unfairly blamed for a rival gang member's death and who must fight their way back home amidst a ""jungle"" of gangs out to get them (e.g. the bat-wielding ""Baseball Furies"") Many gang members, fratmen and other tough guy ""wannabes"" will find something in this film they can relate to: from the feeling of loyalty, of being social outcasts, bravery and the like.  Particularly powerful non-fight scene: when the Warriors board a train, encounter a group of obviously high society teenagers out having a good time.  The exchange of looks, body movements and the like, until the time the ""socs"" step out, conveys a lot.
Based on the novel by Sol Yurick, the film features what'r probably the best performance of Michael Beck.  Why only 4 stars?  Well, for a film of this age, I would have expected more extra features, i.e. interviews with cast perhaps.  Still, this is an excellent collectible particularly for the film's cult following.

237765,5,6300213714,"Walter Hill ( ""48 Hrs"", ""Hard Times"", ""Extreme Prejudice"" ) shows his directing flair for action, drama and style in this crackling 1979 movie about a Coney Island gang falsely accused of murder and fleeing from their accusers....the other NYC gangs and the New York City Police Department.

Hill successfully adapted to the screen the moderately popular novel by author Sol Yurick who worked with the NYC Dept of Welfare in the 1950's. Yurick used the basis of ancient Greek history and the torturous trek home by Greek soldiers after their leader , Cyrus the Younger, was killed in the Persian Wars...and simply updated the setting to modern day NY and it's raging gang warfare embracing the five boroughs !

Set amongst a hostile, nocturnal world of neon lit train stations, baseball bat wielding gang members and lethal, gun toting women ""The Warriors"" moves along at a frenetic pace with a fine selection of young actors taking the lead. Michael Beck plays the cool headed, war chief ""Swan"", seeking to get the other members back home to Coney Island alive and in one piece. James Remar is unforgettable as the woman chasing, hot headed ""Ajax""...always out to prove his manhood with his fists. And David Patrick Kelly is perfect as the murderous, but cowardly leader of the Rogues.

Attending a combined meeting of dozens of street gangs deep in the South Bronx to hear the Gramercy Riffs plans to control the streets of New York, the Warriors are wrongly accused of the shooting death of their charismatic leader, ""Cyrus"". The finger of blame pointed their way, they flee via any means they can and upon their way back to home base encounter violent opposition from the low life ""Orphans"", the shaven headed ""Turnbull AC's"", the face painted ""Baseball Furies"", the seductive all female gang, the ""Lizzies"" and even rifts within their own ranks lead to trouble.

The film was roundly savaged by several sections of the community (mainly law enforcement & welfare groups) upon it's release for apparently inciting gang violence and it's poor depiction of inner city street kids, and yes, there were several nasty incidents at theatre's upon the film's release, but these have been blown well out of all proportion. Although, I must say when the film was released in my country (Australia) it was already riding a wave of notoriety, and attracted ""bad boys"" in their droves to watch this ""infamous"" gang flick. When viewed in the cold light of day, the film is actually fairly cartoon like in it's depiction of urban violence and most anyone who receives a beating seems to be left just rubbing their head and moaning ( think Sylvester the Cat ) in discomfort !

Actor Thomas G. Waites who played the Warriors gang member ""Fox"", disagreed with the script and effectively walked out in mid-production, so a grip doubled for Waites in several scenes and Waites' name was removed from the final credits. Additionally, the ""Fox"" character's fate was re-written to have him die in the film after being hurled in front of a subway train.

Interestingly, out of a on screen line up of promising young talent, very few of the cast went on to any real major fame & fortune in Hollywood. Lead actor Michael Beck (Swan) went on to appear next in the sugary ""Xanadu"" with Olivia Newton-John, and by his own admission, it was not a great career move, and his film career unfortunately never really flourished. James Remar (Ajax) has easily experienced the most success (with about 70 feature film's under his belt) and he has continued his motif of tough, aggressive leads in films like ""48 Hrs"", and plenty of ""straight to video"" action fare...plus Remar even crops up regularly on ""Sex and the City"" & ""Third Watch"" re-runs ! (It's good to see that hard hitting ""Ajax"" never left New York.) And the terrific David Patrick Kelly has kept busy, usually in other sinister, criminal roles...check out his performances in ""Commando"", ""The Crow"" & ""Wild at Heart"" !
Sadly, young actor Marcellino Sanchez who played graffiti artist ""Rembrandt"" died from cancer only a few years after the films release.

The recently released ""Ultimate Directors Cut"" of this cult classic has several superb extras. Apart from an introduction from director Walter Hill, and some interconnecting comic panel art between sequences in the feature, the DVD has four mini featurettes chock full of interviews with key cast members and production staff discussing key sequences in the film, plus the phenomenal cult following that has developed for ""The Warriors"".

A colorful, exciting and fast paced film...albeit corny in places with that silly love story sub plot with bee stung lipped, Deborah Van Valkenbergh...""The Warriors"" is a bona fide cult film with a legion of fans across the globe.",971740800,137,4758,4.923940149625935

237767,5,6300213714,"I'm not exactly sure what it is about this movie that has always made it a favorite of mine, ever since I was in middle school when it first came out and seeing it was forbidden to me because it was a hard R movie with lots of violence.  I remember a lot of the tough, older kids in middle school dressing up as various members of The Warriors and other gangs in the movie (all the gangs in the movie have various costumes).  This really freaked my 11 year old self out.
It was a big controversy at the school that all these kids had dressed up like the characters in this movie because the movie itself was controversial for its violence, which is pretty mild by today's standards.  I don't think it was the level of violence that caused the controversy.  Rather, I think it was that this movie does such a good job of making this whole cartoon street gang lifestyle seem so cool.  After seeing the movie, it makes you feel like you want to be in a street gang, in the same way that seeing Rocky makes a kid want be a boxer, or seeing Rambo makes a kid want to run around in the jungle with a gigantic knife that has a compass in the handle.  I think the adults recognized that kids thought this violent street gang movie was so cool, and it scared the cr@p out of the adults, so theaters were banning the movie.  And only the most rebellious kids dressed up as a Warrior for Halloween.
I'm 31 now, and I still love to watch this movie.  I've seen it dozens and dozens of times over the years, and I never get sick of it.  I think everyone who loves movies has at least a few movies that are like that for them.
Plenty of the reviews here have already explained the premise and plot of the film, so I won't repeat them.  I give The Warriors 5 stars, but certainly a person with a mind to do so could pick all kinds of holes in this thing, find flaws in the acting or the script or whatever.  None of that means anything to me in this case.  This movie is just a fun thrillride and my disbelief and critical eye is 100% suspended.

237769,5,6300213714,"I've seen a lot of movies in my time, ""The Warriors"" is by far the best movie ever made, and that's no idle exaggeration.
You know those new Nike commercials featuring ""communiques"" by ""Mrs.  Jones""?  Ripped off straight from The Warriors.  I'm surprised that  Walter Hill doesn't sue.  The so-called ""Mrs. Jones"" is clearly  based on the radio DJ in ""The Warriors"" who seems to work for the  Bronx's top gang, the Gramercy Park Riffs, by coordinating the efforts of  all the gangs in New York (except the pathetic Orphans -- ""they're not  in our network"") to hunt down and destroy the renegade Warriors for  supposedly gunning down the gangsta messiah Cyrus.
Talk about ahead of  its time!  Most people dismiss the Warriors offhand as a campy, old-school  action movie with a shallow, unrealistic plot glamorizing gang life.  But  upon the fifth in-depth viewing or so, one begins to realize that nothing  could be further from the truth.  For instance, how many of those who've  seen the movie know that it was based on a highly political novel by  radical activist Sol Yurick?  How many have pondered the historical  significance of the name ""Cyrus""?  Or the fact that ""The  Warriors"" has brief, uncredited appearances by celebrities like Tony  Danza, Geddy Lee of Rush, and Todd Bridges (Willis from Different Strokes)?
In fact, ""The Warriors"" brims with astute social commentary  on the nature of class, urban decay and social change in 1970s America.  No  moment in cinematic history is more transcendent than the movie's final,  poetic climax on a Coney Island beach after an all-night chase and ordeal.  It makes one feel exhausted but passionately tranquil, as if one had just  stayed up all night to make love, fight a duel, and write a brilliant  master's thesis all at the same time.
And what's more amazing is that  Walter Hill went on to make such crappy films as ""Geronimo,""  considering the cinematic genius of ""The Warriors"".  Forget all  that other old-school jive like ""Shaft"".  Once you watch the  first few minutes of ""The Warriors"" and feast your eyes upon the  gang of guys that look like mimes, not to mention the gang of guys that  look like Cooter and Uncle Jesse combined (but wearing roller skates) in  the unforgettable opening montage-shot of all the various gangs getting on  subways and converging for Cyrus' big speech, you will be hooked  forever.

The ficticious gang the Warriors heads on the Subway to the Bronx from the most distant part of Brooklyn to meet the head of a gang named (Cyrus).

237843,4,6300213714,"From the opening night shot of the Wonder Wheel's flickering lights, viewers are drawn into the surreal world of New York City street gangs in the 1979 film; The Warriors. The distant frame of a dark, foresaken, Coney  Island amusement park is ominously accentuated by a haunting keyboard fill  from Barry De Vorzen's masterful soundtrack.  Something is going to happen  on this summer night in New York City and director Walter Hill is the tour  guide.  Hill hits full throttle in this gritty yet fluorescent street  pagent where the past meets the future.  Sadly the film caused a series of  violent incidents among movie patrons which resulted in exhibitors pulling  the film from theaters.  Paramount Pictures backed the drastic action after  Time magazine published an article based on the film's violence, which  purportedly induced gangs watching the movie in Chicago and Boston to  attack innocent bystanders.  One death actually occured in a theater.  The  bizarre  after-effects and short theatrical run associated with the film  has contributed to its underground status.  The Warriors shattered the  conventionality of the street gang genre.  A montage of concrete darkness,  bright hues, thematic resolutions, racial solidarity, and human survival  mark the film's restlessness.  Crisp editing, brilliant cinamatography, and  a collection of indelible characters encapsulates the film's aura.  The  scenes filmed in the NYC subway system seen too realistic.  The sounds,  sights, and anxiety that emanate from the subway system are captured and  amplified brilliantly.  The paradoxical notion that the NYC subway system  will serve as the means for safe transport for a desperate gang on the run  from the Bronx to Brooklyn is clever.  Yes the Warriors could have hot  wired a car and driven down the FDR drive to the Brooklyn Bridge and on to  Coney Island, but this solution only occurs at the film's conclusion.  The  viewer is entrapped in the plight of our protagonists as they sift through  the concrete labyrinth, confronting cops, rival gangs, and street women.  When the Warriors finally reach their destination at dawn, the realization  of their poverty is a force they cannot fight or escape.  Swann exemplifies  his social confinement on society's lowest rung, when he pulls Mercy's hand  down while she attempts to preen herself in front of two prom couples that  have boarded the subway. (Don't ask why the two prom couples are not in a  limousine).  Teenage social divisions were never exploited in such a  manner.  This scene was a powerful testament to the divergent social,  economic, and racial class systems that exist in the United States.  Joe  Walsh's rock anthem In the City is the reflective lid that ends this unique  film.  The Warriors is a film that thrills, entertains, and questions  society's answers to urban decay.  One glarring blooper is apparent in the  film.  When the remaining members of the gang finally meet at the Union  Square station, no reference is made to Fox. The members inquire about  Ajax, but what about Fox who was thrown onto the tracks during the fight  with  the police officer?

It's a trip from one end of the New York City subway system to the other, but for the Warriors, it's like a journey to the far side of the moon.  The gangs are the ""Army Of the Night"", they  outnumber the cops 5 to 1, and tonight, they are all out to get the  Warriors.

A hostile gang kills the leader of the Riffs, the gang organizing  the meeting, and raises the cry that the Warriors are to blame.  Cleon, the  Warrior's president, is killed while trying to extricate them from being  jumped by the dead man's enraged gang, leaving Swan, his second in command,  in charge of getting the Warriors back to safety in Brooklyn.  It's a long  ride back home from the upper reaches of the Bronx, and it means fighting  their way through hostile gangs all out for their blood.  After the final  confrontation, on the beach of Coney Island, the remnants of the Warriors  are home free.

The movie is filmed in day-glo colors and the action is  non-stop; it hits you hard and doesn't let up.  It's a tough, gritty,  intense story of loyalty and survival in the urban  jungle.

This film is awesome, it epitomises the feel of togetherness and community.  I love the fighting scenes.  Normally,  I despise the violence, but from aesthetical point of view this is  brilliant.  It is well choreographed and acted and the soundtrack(got it:);  is really cool, especially 'that' tune by Mandrill. This is the film for  dreamers and is going to keep its cult status for a long, long time. Simply  mesmerising...",950832000,2,535,4.655913978494624

My father wrote the screenplay for The Warriors, and I'm hoping this ""review"" gets printed because he just passed away on Thursday morning, November 4th, of a  sudden burst anneurism. With so many ""Warriors"" fans out there, I  thought you would want to know.  I'm incredibly warmed by these wonderful  comments about this film and I know that if he read them (although he had  barely learned how to search the internet before he died) he would chuckle  in his lighthearted way and say something like ""Oh, well isn't that  nice,"" all-the-while refusing to take credit for any of it.  But I  know he deserved that credit, having taken a dark, psychological study of  gang warfare and infusing it with a classic but clever and topical, good  vs. evil story.  (And maybe I shouldn't admit it, but my dad didn't really  like the baseball face-paint idea which I believe was one of Walter Hill's  additions - he thought that was too unrealistic and  ""Hollywood""...)  Anyway, I do hope the movie is re-issued with  the extra scenes at some point, and for those real ""followers"" I  just discovered that you can find a complete list of his produced titles on  the Internet Movie Database (IMDb.com) if you want to check it out.

The Warriors is a great movie from the '80s...and so is it's original theatrical cut. However, this isn't it. While I can understand an artist wanting to add something to an original piece that for whatever reason couldn't be done at the time, sometimes messing with something doesn't have the desired effect of making it better. This is such an example. The added ""comic book"" transitions really kills this movie, as the pace of the movie is entirely affected. This isn't a movie that needed anything. I totally regret buying my copy.  The only reason I give this even 3 stars is because the 85% or so unaffected is still what it is.

OH NO CRIME MIMES! CHEESE IT!

Long review:
5/10, contains 35% post-consumer dudes looking hard by volume
This must be what it's like to not actually see gangs but just hear and dream about them.
Every stereotype ever is depicted but somehow multiracial gangs abound.
(Man i wanted to sleep but that french shirt gang with the asians kept me up all night with their purple jacket pimps gang war.)
Only the women gang has more than one gun but still has to lure men into a sexy trap to shoot (at) them.
What a progressive time the 70's must have been... but I digress.
If you like watching movies filled with shirtless dudes (""Maybe you're all just goin' f****t"") then this is an 8/10.
MEMORABLE MOMENTS:
*unreliable leather daddy gang leader is allowed to accuse competent and proud black man appropriating native gear
*faceless DJ who totally broadcasts gang news in a cryptic but completely obvious way is terrible at apologies
*Mercy, who should have been totally murdered by the first gang years ago, somehow gets post movie foreshadowing with swan despite instigating gang fight
*improbable undercover whistle cop is heard from inside cop car that is out of visual range
(she doesn't need close backup bob, she's got a whistle.)
*whistle cop car cops improbably don't both beat ajax at same time, don't spin out doing pre perp poke donuts
*cop is taken down by family guy style shin damage for the count
*ajax and his overbearing obsession with gays (""He's right! We're acting like f****ts!"")
*an actor wanted out of this move so badly his character ate a train
*and last but certainly not least: the crime mime syndicate
