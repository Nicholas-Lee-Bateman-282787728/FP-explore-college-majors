8587958,5,B00CZNZQGS,"I grew up watching lil' Jimmy on his award-winning cartoon Norton and Friends every Saturday morning (airing between The Mad Scientist and Epschtine"" and Uncle Paul's Playhouse) and was an integral part of my childhood. Growing up in a household where there was always spaghetti being thrown at the wall and having to take my lunch to school in an old concrete bag, the misadventures of Yimmy and his neighborhood pals Bobby and Vos comforted me and made me laugh in times of need. So it warmed my heart when I heard Jimmy appear on my favorite radio show ""Gregg and Tony"" to promote his new real estate/prank phone call DVD. I bought it and watched it with my civil union partner Scott Shannon and we both gave it two emaciated thumbs up! Buy this DVD and let the merry chuckling with pals begin!",1389571200,,797,4.541666666666667

8587962,4,B00CZNZQGS,I purchased the dvd and enjoy the comedy of Jim Norton very much. The only thing i was not happy with is in regards to the disk itself. The last segment shuts off about halfway through it.,1378252800,,188,4.108108108108108
