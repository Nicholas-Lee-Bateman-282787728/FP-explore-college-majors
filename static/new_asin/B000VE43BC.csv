2938859,4,B000VE43BC,"My wife and I watched the movie recently and we both enjoyed it very much. The film's excellent, period! Anyone curious to learn about this unique salsa singer should purchase the DVD. Though I must confess the biographical nature of it was sad for me to see. Of course it's unavoidable as he led such a tragic life. Hector must've had many wonderfully fun moments during his short life, but you couldn't really extract that from watching the film.

Having said that, I give high accolades to all involved in its production. Both Marc and Jennifer were excellent in their respective acting roles. I was particularly impressed with Jennifer and would agree with a commenter here that she should receive Oscar consideration.

Side notes: I wish the relationships between Hector and the other musicians like Willy Colon would've been explored even further. And that the director would've allowed the actor playing Ruben Blades to finish singing the song El Cantante on acoustic guitar - very cool.",1193356800,44,994,4.981927710843373
2938860,5,B000VE43BC,"I seen this movie three times in the theatre's and I was so shocked at the amazing acting skills Jennifer had to bring to life on screen such a strong powerful women who doesn't take crap from no one. Her acting in this flick was out of this world. I am a HUGE fan of Jennifer and have seen almost all of her movies but this movie comes 2nd to best of Selena. Marc also did such a wonderful job in bringing Hector to life on screen. The acting was dead on. I really hope that when oscar time comes around that she really gets credit for this role. Even before the release people had the label of ""oscar"" written all over it! Let's cross our fingers. In any case the acting skills of both where out of this world. This will be a great movie to own and watch over and over again.",1192320000,3,777,4.0519480519480515
2938861,5,B000VE43BC,i must say at first i was kind of iffy about this movie. But this movie had me going from the begining until the end. The music and the roles that were played were EXCELLENT!!!! Jennifer and Marc played their roles to the fullest. Made me feel like i was part of the movie or wish i could part of that era.,1189814400,9,306,3.9516129032258065
2938862,4,B000VE43BC,"Wow it's incredible how jennifer lopez can get into a character and live it,if you're not familiar with this singer,well watch the movie 'cause he was one of the best salsa performers of his time,right now we can say that Marc Anthony is his pupil,and he is a good student. The music of the movie is in tune with the scenes of the movie and and it makes it kind of sad and retrospective about how his life would end. Great movie and soundtrack,I have never seen jennifer being such a good actress on this movie,sometimes i think this their life (marc and Jen)but with,let's hope a happy ending...watch it it's worth it,can't wait for the dvd.",1189123200,3,642,4.495726495726496
2938863,3,B000VE43BC,"The life of salsa singer Hector Lavoe (Marc Anthony) is told in a series of flashbacks based on interviews with his wife Pucci (Jenifer Lopez). Lavoe arrived in New York, from Puerto Rico, in 1975. He teamed with musician Willie Colon to help create and popularize salsa, a blend of rumba, mambo, merengue and jazz that still remains among the most beloved forms of Latin music. Soon Lavoe descends into a netherworld of sex and drugs, eventually becoming so irresponsible that he loses Colon as a band mate. Lavoe and Pucci struggle through many years of addiction, infidelity and conflict until Lavoe finally dies of AIDS in 1993.

My wife is Latina and a huge fan of salsa. So I was really looking forward to learning more about this the music and it's history. On that level the movie is a great success, with some terrific musical performances and scenes that effectively capture the ambience and excesses of the salsa scene in the 1970's.

Unfortunately, the storyline revolves around a cliche - ""musician hits the bigtime and then spirals downward into self-destruction."" The biopics about Ray Charles and Johnny Cash also touch on their drug problems. But those movies explored other aspects of the musician's life and personality. Here it all revolves around Lavoe's addiction. Also the underlaying reasons are covered only in brief scenes discussing his mother's death and his estranged relationship with his father. But nothing about Lavoe's background or pyschological issues is ever looked at in a substantial or meaningful way. Instead Lavoe comes across as just another pathetic and miserable junkie that is hard to have sympathy or respect for despite his great musical accomplishments. Even more unlikable is his wife, Pucci, a hot tempered, superficial witch who seems to embody every negative, and usually false, stereotype about Latin women. The real life Pucci couldn't have been as bad as she is made to be in this movie. But, unlike several other reviewers, I did find Anthony convincing as Hector Lavoe. Lopez, in contrast, just seems to be playing an especially cocky and ill tempered version of herself and this interfered with my enjoyment of the movie.

I still consider this a film worth watching for salsa fans and those interested in learning more about the music. But the cliche storyline and unlikable characters do detract from it's overall quality.",1187395200,4,2383,5.043147208121828
2938864,4,B000VE43BC,"The music and vocals sung by Marc Anthony make this movie excellent despite its shortcomings by the poor directing. The story is excellent and Anthony and Lopez put in superb performances.

I would have given this movie 5 stars except that the directing made it sometimes annoying to know when something was happening. The story is based on an interview with Lavoe's wife (played by Jennifer Lopez in black and white during her story telling segments).

Lavoe was a super-talented singer who along with Johnny Pacheco and Willie Colon began the Salsa Revolution in the 1970's. With all his success he never gains acceptance from his father and that contributes to his downfall into the world of drugs. Drugs also turn him from a fun-loving guy to an abusive husband, an irresponsible parent and an undependable band member. As each woe mounts, everything dear to Lavoe is lost.

His story has a lot of parallels to Jim Morrison another tragic figure in the world of music that let drugs ruin everything.",1186963200,,1003,4.853801169590644
2938865,2,B000VE43BC,"If this film was about the great salsa singer Hector Lavoe, then it would have been better served if Jennifer Lopez would have played the role instead of husband Marc Anthony! If John Travolta can play Edna Turnblad in ""Hairspray"" then Lopez could have pulled off Lavoe! Seriously, this is one confusing film that is so over edited that one could get seizures from all of the back and forth cuts! If anything is good about ""El Cantante"" (The Singer) it is Lopez as Puchi Lavoe. An excellent performance,though, cannot justify this film's credibility. It is long and over styled like salsa with too much pepper. Jennifer may just get an Oscar nod here, but if I could edit out her husband I would!",1186444800,,696,4.620967741935484
2938866,3,B000VE43BC,"Hollywood has been churning out biopics on famous musicians that have slid into degradation in RAY and WALK THE LINE over the last few years. Even last years' DREAMGIRLS had tinges of the success to the dregs in it. It is tough to watch people on the screen for 2 hours slowly slip into an irreversible chasm of their own doing. Thus we come to the latest in the ""going-downhill-singer flick"" in EL CANTANTE about the late  salsa singer Hector Lavoe who revolutionized the Latin music world in the 1970's. He rises to success and ultimately plummets into drugs and eventually succumbed to HIV/AIDS in 1993. It's a downer. Marc Anthony is magnificent,but not as electrifying, as Lavoe was in real life,but still does an adequate job in the singing sequences. Is he an actor though? I think not. He really needs help and direction in that field. Who does act in this film? JLo, that's who! As Hector's positively domineering and dominating wife/lover Pucci, Lopez scores big and gives this film the energy that is needed to propel the story along. Yes, Anthony and Lopez are real life husband and wife, but Anthony's lack of acting skills really shoots the screen chemistry apart. Sorry,Marc, but your wife is way better than you are. Watch SELENA! Jennifer sizzles and shakes that booty of hers and I am glad to see her return to such a role that she does very well (and I am not a fan in the least!...but I do give credit where it is deserved!). Not a great picture, but not a bad one either. If you know and enjoy the music of Lavoe, than perhaps the singing alone is all that you will need to enjoy this film.",1186358400,4,1611,4.517123287671233

I was hoping for more insight into who Hector was, where he came from, and how he got to be such an awesome singer.  How is it that he was at the right place and time when Salsa was being born?  How did he shape salsa?  What was his relationship with Willie Colon, Fania All Stars, and Fania Records?  These things are all glossed over in this movie.",1463270400,2,633,4.26890756302521

2938977,1,B000VE43BC,Thought that I was going to see a biography about Hector Lavoe and the origins of Salsa. Instead you get 99% of the screen time devoted  to Lavoe's wife (who cares)  and the atrocious bad acting of Jennifer Lopez.  The only good thing is Anthony's singing but he never completes a song  as Ms Lopez  took all  the screen time.,1441065600,,326,4.35

2939032,4,B000VE43BC,They needed more time! This was a very good film but there was more to Hector than drugs and turmoil. If the movie was a bit longer I'm sure it would have shown that. Instead it was seemingly only from one persons perspective. In everyone's life there are good things as well. My only wish would have been to see more of that shown in this film. Hector was a unforgettable icon who was bigger than life and extremely kindhearted. This film only portrays him as a fantastic well loved singer and drug addict. He was just so much more than that! I'm sure if given another chance this movie could have been a blockbuster...,1401580800,,620,4.4

2939037,4,B000VE43BC,"It was my first and only biopic movie of the salsa genre so I don't have much to compare it to (I did see Mambo Kings the next day, but it was not as good, imho), but I definitely enjoyed it cause for moments here and there I would forget that it was not a ""reality"" show but a movie.  The way it was played seemed realistic to me regarding the basic story of what I know happened in real life to the main character.  I would recommend it to someone like myself who is just getting to know about the legends of old school Salsa. Perhaps, die hard purists and experts might have a different recollection of the real events of this life story because they were there or have family or friends who lived through that NYC music scene back in the 70s.  However, it was enjoyable and I felt educated even though it was not a documentary and I would definitely watch it again.",1394668800,,869,4.191616766467066

& starting acting
but the only other movie I did like was Selena & she was very good in that !
I love this movie cause her & Marc played the parts very well I don't care what you say
I have read in the past others saying this movie was not that good  well they are wrong!
In my Opinion this maybe ONE of the BEST movies ever made maybe in the Underground world instead of Hollywood.
Which by the way if I can remember correctly Hollywood did not give this movie very good reviews
So it's plan to see they know NADA about the Latin community",1393200000,,654,3.873134328358209
2939039,5,B000VE43BC,I did not think they gave this movie its just due!  Although I am not a big fan of Jennifer Lopez's she and Marc Anthony did a wonderful job on this movie and its soundtrack.  He played Hector almost tooooooo well!!!!! She may have over-played wifey a little but it all worked.  It was a good movie.  I think Jennifer's high profile outside of movie may have took away from this production and cost them in a big way.,1393027200,,417,4.2405063291139244

2939047,5,B000VE43BC,"This movie is fabulous. You felt the music in your heart and at times I wanted to get up and dance.  I think some of the reviewers got caught up with the fact that Jennifer Lopez produced the movie and this is why there are a few bad reviews.  Honestly even if you are not a Jennifer Lopez fan, she is undeniably Puchi Perez in El Cantante.  As for Marc Anthony, I love him and his singing is very capturing in the movie. In my opinion, he represented Hector Lavoe beautifully.  Unfortunately El Cantante did not get enough credit, theater time and advertisement which is really sad.  Watch this movie, you will not be disappointed.",1384214400,,632,4.460869565217391

Jennifer and Marc are naturals for the roles they played in this movie - and their cultural heritage had a lot to do with it.  That's what made it so believable - they understood the music, the cultural nuances, and the love-hate relationship!!!  A friend told me that this was a must see and I told many other friends and family.  But the features add another level of attachment to this movie.  Yes, I said attachment.

2939075,1,B000VE43BC,"Only JLO has the ego and balls to waste the opportunity to make a grand movie about one of Salsa and Fania'a biggest stars. Instead she turns it into an ego trip in which the supposed title character is almost a cameo performer. Instead she has most of the screen time playing the untalented and unknown by the public, co-dependant, queen bitch, wife. Rather than a film filled with the mostly brilliant music produced by Lavoe, ironically in a film titled El Cantante (the singer) , we are served a series of monologues by Lopez bemoaning Lavoe's well known drug battles, without acknowledging her own apparent drug issues. But really the biggest problem is the pointless focus on the wife, the film should have been about Lavoe and his music, not Lopez and her desire to be on screen.
  Interspersed with these poorly acted monologues we get snips of songs here and there (the subtitled lyrics are a joke, mostly not even close to the intent of the lyrics), then of course there are the repetitious family blow up scenes, which look like they would be more at home on one of the spanish soaps, than on the big screen. A pity really, while Anthony is certainly a passable singer he is no where near the same league as Lavoe in his prime. But he does do a credible job on portraying Lavoe, a shame it did not get more time as he could have really pulled it off.
  Then the film just ends. Even then the closing shot is of Lopez. Not a shock, but Lavoe and his life, just as in real life, deserved better.",1359072000,,1504,4.418772563176895

2939098,4,B000VE43BC,"I love music industry biopics in general, and so I assumed I would enjoy this movie even though I knew absolutely nothing about Hector Lavoe or Salsa music.  As it turns out, I had indeed guessed right.  Knowledge of this particular artist or his musical genre is not essential in any way.

First, however, there are some legitimate criticisms of this film that can be made.  Jennifer Lopez, who produced this film, gives her character's role in this movie way too much screentime.  Hector's girlfriend, Puchi, is interesting and important, but she is not nearly as important as Hector himself.  The viewer is short-changed when it comes to being educated about Hector Lavoe, who is El Cantante.  He played a very significant role in the development and growing popularity of Salsa, but we are not told enough of his story.  The script is far too vague about too many things.

But the movie has two very strong aspects that serve to outweigh its limitations.  First, the music is fantastic.  Every single one of the musical interludes presented in this film are vivid and colorful and soulful.  This film will make you a fan of Salsa if you weren't already.  Second, the acting is superb.  Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony provide the wounded, brutal intensity that their characters deserve. You will never forget them.

2939103,1,B000VE43BC,"Yeah, no kidding this was produced by Lopez herself. The whole thing is like one extended Jennifer Lopez video.
""Look at me, I'm shaking my booty. Look at my hair, look at me smiling, look at me with my period makeup. Look how sexy I am even snorting coke in my wig! I'm even hot in the '70's""
Every scene seemed like an opportunity for Lopez to showcase how gorgous and hot she is...oh, and the director encourages it! In every scene he makes sure to capture Lopez makeup and hair and clothes even if it has no impact whatsoever on the story line. Even if showing her makes no sense. There she is.
This movie was irritating on so many levels. You know that music they play in Mexican Restaurants? Well this whole movie features that kind of white noise. At first it made me hungry for con queso and chips. After that, it just kept reminding me that salsa is really not so great of a musical genre. It all sounds the same and it's hopelessly trite.
And lastly, Marc Anthony. This man is so bad. Such an ugly little rat faced monkey that it was impossible for me to believe he was any sort of 'ladies man' let alone a Latino Rock Star. Are you kidding me? He'd be great as a creepy character actor playing a small role as a janitor or maybe even a pervert of some sort. But to give him 2nd billing in a Jennifer Lopez movie and show him almost as much as Lopez...it made me completely disgusted by this skinny and hideous little man. He's like Gollum sans the cute.

2939106,4,B000VE43BC,"I am not a J-Lopez fan, not much of today's salsa fan and I consider Mark Anthony a great salsa singer but only a tepid actor. Having established that, I love '70s salsa (salsa that you could dance AND listen to) and grew up listening to Hector Lavoe. After watching this movie I realized that I had in fact caught -quite by accident- perhaps the last radio interview Lavoe gave before he died in the early `90s. None of the drama here got was even hinted at during that radio interview and the movie explains why.

J-Lopez is by far the most over-rated celebrity ever but in this movie she gives an unimpeachable performance, she's solid. In the first two minutes she draws you in and the movie manages to show her different sides, inconsistencies and develops her into a complex character. Mark Anthony earns his money too; he's funny and introspective. Director Leon Ichaso is hit-and-miss in recreating the characters' torrid relationship but made a beautifully artsy movie; it was good to FINALLY see a director using the palate of Caribbean colors to full effect in film.

There are a few duds in El Cantante though, and they cost it a few stars.
1) The film runs longer than it needs to; after a while it begins to rehash and overkill the points it's trying to make.
2) ""Puchi"" (Lopez) is supposed to be a feisty yet uneducated girl from the barrio but her dialogue is often above her experience, as if she had years of therapy and has all kinds of insights to share. I loved her part of the script but it is above the experience the character is supposed to have had.
3) The use of fragmented scenes bespeaks of Lavoe's losing sight of reality through drug use, but it is overdone and sometimes without clear purpose. It also runs -inexplicably- throughout the movie, not just after Lavoe's first use of hard drugs.
4) Lavoe sang a lot about social issues (i.e. ""Juanito Alimana"") but this gets no mention in the movie.
5) Anthony is a great salsa singer in his own right but his sounds NOTHING like Lavoe's nasally/throaty voice. Either sing like him or dub someone who does.
6) One is led to believe that Lavoe's partner, Willie Colon, faded into obscurity after leaving the combo. In fact, Colon hooked-up with Ruben Blades and became even more famous than Lavoe ever was. He then went solo and recorded his own songs. I confess I didn't even know Lavoe and Colon had collaborated so closely originally, since Blades/Colon were THE legendary duo, recording perhaps the most famous salsa classics together. This movie was made not because Lavoe was the most famous salsa singer but because of the tragedies in his life.
7) Salsa does get overplayed in the movie. Yes, it sets the mood but this is supposed to be a drama, not 1/4 music video. A nitpicky aspect is that while the wardrobe is exquisitely adapted to the '70s and '80s, many of the salsa dance moves are blatantly contemporary. This won't be lost on anyone who dances salsa.

I have traveled a lot and from South Africa to London to Moscow to Japan, salsa is danced in ballrooms everywhere. For crying out loud, there was even a salsa combo in the early '90s of Japanese musicians (""La Orquesta de la Luz"") who sang salsa in Spanish! This movie is about how that revolution started and how one of its most prominent singers became a victim of his own success.

A very solid 3 1/2 stars, finally an American-Latin movie with nuance (not many of those) but with a little way to go still. May there be more.

2939107,2,B000VE43BC,"**1/2

In 1963, Hector Perez was already a promising young singer in his native Puerto Rico when, at the age of seventeen, he moved to New York City to try and make a name for himself as a performer there.  In no time flat, he was playing in clubs, had signed a lucrative recording contract with the Latin-flavored Fania Records, and had changed his name to the far more exotic-sounding Hector Lavoe.  From the mid-1960s to his death from AIDS in 1993, Lavoe was an international sensation who helped to popularize the musical style known as ""Salsa.""  But, as with most artists, he lived a life of self-destructive self-indulgence, marked by serial philandering and hardcore drug abuse.  He also had a volatile relationship with ""Puchi,"" the Bronx girl who became his wife and who narrates ""El Cantante,"" the glossy movie about his life.

Despite the novelty of the milieu and an undeniable sincerity on the part of everyone involved in its production, ""El Cantante"" remains doggedly conventional, lackluster and superficial in its treatment of the kind of material with which we are all too familiar from previous biopics that have chronicled the rise and fall of artists of all categories and stripes.  Marc Antony brings a certain ferocity and depth to his portrayal of the struggling celebrity, but real-life wife Jennifer Lopez is all fluttery overacting as the woman who stood by her man through good times and bad (mostly bad).  The music is enjoyable, but I'm afraid we've all been down this road so many times before that ""El Cantante"" fails to stir either our passions or our sympathy for the sadly benighted couple and all that they're going through.  You'd be better off buying the albums instead.",1227916800,,1709,4.885813148788928

I didn't know anything about Hector Lavoe before this film and sadly I still don't know that much about him.  I agree that as a biopic, the film fails to get the audience to connect with its main star.  In fact, it seems to go out of its way to show how much of a selfish jerk (keeping it P.G.) he was.  I think it has a lot to do with Anthony always wearing sunglasses in the film.  You have to show the movie audience your eyes.  That's how we bond with people.  The sunglasses allowed Marc Anthony to hide from the audience-and therefore gave us a sense that Anthony's performance was false.  Lopez needs to give up the singing and stick to acting.  Also, I do agree with some of the other reviewers has said about the direction and editing.  I don't think they should have approached this film like a faux documentary.

Nuyorican Productions  tambin es responsable por habernos trado la nueva mini serie ""Como Ama Un Mujer""  vista recientemente por la  televisin local en Unvisin basada en el CD de Jennifer Lpez del mismo titulo que tambin saldr en DVD a comienzos del mes de diciembre. Ambas producciones estarn disponibles justo a tiempo para la poca de navidad.

Antes que nada, la pelcula ""El Cantante"" no es tan mala como la gente sugiere. Jennifer Lpez en el papel de Puchi,y Marc Anthony en el papel de Hedor Lavoe actan fantsticamente bien. Solo verlos juntos es razn suficiente para ver o obtener este DVD. ""El Cantante"", dirigida por Leon Ichaso,  es basada en la cancin del mismo titulo escrita por Rubn Bladez  especficamente para Hctor Lavoe.

Dicen que Hctor Lavoe fue a la msica de salsa lo que Frank Sinatra fue a al msica ""pop"". Lavoe fue uno de los pioneros de el gnero de la salsa. El pudo combinar la msica puertorriquea con la influencia de la msica norteamericana. La pelcula ""El Cantante"" trata de incluir los humildes comienzos de la vida de Hctor Lavoe  desde su adolescencia como cantante en Puerto Rico hasta su vida  como un dolo latino viviendo en la ciudad de Nueva York. El filme contiene varios nmeros musicales combinados con situaciones penosas en la vida del cantante. Marc  Anthony acta adems nos interpreta -como solo el sabe cantar- las canciones `El Cantante"", ""Mi gente"", ""Che che col"", ""Escndalo"", ""Qu lo"", ""Qutate t"" y ""Todo tiene su final"".

Marc Anthony en el papel de Hctor Lavo nos excita y hechiza. Jennifer Lpez, esplendida y cautivante en el papel de Puchi. Ella vive el personaje de una chica hispana de carcter fuerte del Bronx en Nueva York (una Nuyorican) que tiene mucha confianza en si mismo. Ella es la musa y el objeto de amor y admiracin de Hctor.
Marc Anthony nos hechiza cantando canciones exitosas de los nos 60 y 70 y Jennifer nos demuestra sus dones de buena actriz.

Al Hctor y Puchi conocerse comienzan su jornada y la pelcula nos ensea  un punto de vista interesante en la trayectoria de Hctor Lavoe en la industria musical de la poca grabando discos, vendiendo boletos a conciertos llenos a capacidad y produciendo xito tras xito con el nuevo genero musical de la salsa por el punto de vista de Puchi. En su camino hacia el xito a la fama, Hctor  comienza a destruirse al encontrase con un problema trgico de adicin a  drogas con la cual encontr su muerte prematuramente por el SIDA destruyendo su vida y sus sueos.

La controversia de esta pelcula puede que este en el guin ya que la historia no aparenta seguir ninguna estructura. Momentos importantes o impactantes en la vida de Hctor Lavoe suceden demasiado rpidos y le falta ritmo o seguimiento para uno sentir las emociones de estas dos vidas llenas de tragedias. La vida de los personajes de Lavoe y Puchi aparentan estar desconectados  por lo tanto los personajes secundarios que apoyan o respaldan estos personajes estn menos desarrollados (Ismael Miranda - el papa de Hctor, Johnny Ortiz - Willy Colon, Federico Castelluccio - Jerry Mascucci, y Vctor Manuelle - Ruben Blades entre otros)

La vida de Hctor Lavoe - el cantante - es vista por el punto de vista de Puchi, la esposa de Lavoe. Por lo tanto, esta un poco desconectada y omite varios datos de importancia en la vida de Lavoe. Como sus vidas son vistas por el personaje de Puchi, solo mencionan a otras mujeres en la vida de Hctor de pasada y no nos cuentan ni dice nada de las diferentes giras artsticas y de su vida en el mundo de entretenimiento de los anos 60 y 70. Me imagino que esto pudo haber sido posible si el personaje de Puchi no hubiera sabido de estas cosas o simplemente no quiso que fueran parte de esta pelcula. Este problema a lo mejor pudo haber sido rectificado si la pelcula hubiera sido la vida de Puchi y el personaje de Lavoe un papel secundario. Por la tanto ningn de los personajes estn totalmente desarrollados y dejan a la audiencia un poco vaca.

En una entrevista en Puerto Rico, Jennifer Lpez dijo en el estreno de pelcula, ""La cinta muestra a un artista que dej una msica increble. Est llena de humor, humanidad, amor, y de las cosas negativas de su vida porque eso era en gran parte de donde vino su msica, de ese dolor que el tena"". Pero los familiares de Hctor Lavoe opinaron y dijeron de la pelcula, ""Es muy simple. Si alguien le pregunta a tu mam si t has tomado drogas, lo ms probable es que tu mam diga 'Ests loca! Nunca!'"". ""Hctor fue una persona destruida por las drogas. No hay duda de eso... Pero a la misma vez aqu las drogas no tienen tanto que ver como la msica, como su vida y como todo ese momento en que l sobrevivi"".

Que usted opina? Vean la pelcula y escuchen las entrevistas de Nydia Caro por ustedes mismos, decidan y opinen. Que el pblico y los amantes de la msica salsa y de Hctor Lavoe decidan. La pelcula ""El Cantante"" es controversial o no?",1205366400,,5219,4.596340150699677
2939112,4,B000VE43BC,"Forget whatever you have read about this movie, and buy it.  El Cantante is a powerful and intimate film, interesting and very moving.  I was blown away by the performances of Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony.  It's a bit fast and flashy at the beginning, but stick with it.  Lovely film, and unforgettable story.",1204934400,2,312,4.722222222222222
2939113,4,B000VE43BC,"As a fan of Hector Lavoe, Willie Colon, Rueben Blades and Fania All Stars, I was interested in seeing this movie.  The story is framed as an interview with Hector's widow, Puchi, and the story is told from her point of view.  The interview scenes are filmed in black and white, but when we flash back to scenes of Hector's life the film is in vibrant color.  The movie treats us to a lot of beautiful color, motion and music.  It certainly has plenty of eye and ear candy.

Jennifer Lopez gives a fine performance as she moves from a fun loving  young girl to a mature woman who lives a life filled with drugs, disappointments and tragedy.  Lopez has a lot to work with here as more dramatic time is devoted to Puchi than to Hector.

Marc Anthony does well with the role which concentrates more on the singing than the drama. As expected, he does a marvelous job interpreting Lavoe's music, using the original Willie Colon arrangements.  Although Marc Anthony looks about 30 pounds lighter than Hector Lavoe was, there are moments when Anthony's resemblance to Lavoe is downright eerie! It also surprised me how well Anthony manages to physically portray the age ranges as he transitions from a 16 year old kid singing with his dad in Puerto Rico, to an endearing young guy with big talent and a corny sense of humor, and finally to a man in his late 40's ravaged by booze, drugs, AIDS, and personal tragedies.

There is a very nice cameo by Victor Manuelle playing the young Rueben Blades performing an acoustic version of the song, ""El Cantante.""  Blades wrote the song as a tribute to Hector and presents it to him as a gift.

Although I was familiar with Hector Lavoe's music, I didn't know anything about his personal life.  I wish that the story was told a bit differently with more emphasis on other aspects of his life, and the emergence of the salsa genre.  Instead, it becomes the story of yet another entertainer who is destroyed by alcohol and drugs - a story that was already old when the first version of ""A Star is Born"" was filmed in 1937.  Even with the drug use,  I thought Hector Lavoe's life could have provided material for a more meaningful story than this.

There are nice extras on the DVD including two full length feature commentary tracks - one with director, Leon Ichaso - and one with the writers, David Darmstaeder and Todd Antony Bello.  There is one deleted scene, ""just say no to drugs.""  A feature called  ""the sound and the heat of 'El Cantante' "" - kind of a ""making of..."".  The feature package is rounded out with the theatrical trailer and sneak peeks of other films.

The music and visuals are beautiful.  I wish they had chosen to concentrate on more positive aspects of Lavoe's life. Recommended with reservations.",1202860800,3,2756,4.5682281059063135
2939114,1,B000VE43BC,"Jenifer Lopez and husband Marc Anthony's latest film El Cantante about the Hector Lavoe and the birth of Salsa, is an Oscar nominated-wannabe biopic mess of a film.

The film follows the life of Puerto Rican singer Hector Lavoe, who came to New York in 1975 and became a mega star, starting the Salsa genre. Marc Anthony plays Hector and Jenifer Lopez his wife--Puchi. One of the many problems with this film was that Marc did not have a strong screen presence and his performance became overpowered by the amazing performance by Jenifer Lopez who did such a wonderful job I started thinking it was more about Hector's wife than about Hector.

One effective part of the film I thoroughly enjoyed was how the story cut back and forth through an interview of Hector's wife looking back on Hector's life story. The interview was shot in black and white contrasting with the rich colors of the rest of the film.

Despite this technique, the rest of the film was hard to follow. It seemed to follow a pre-made formula of music montage after music montage intercut with short scenes of dramatic acting, as if the director was following a manual of how to make a musician's biopic film. Also the use of fancy, rapid editing was way overused and after a while seemed only there to give it a sophisticated look.

I love long films but this two hour movie had me checking my watch frequently. Overall it was a big disappointment and I felt the only thing that was good in the film was Jenifer Lopez's performance. Unfortunately even her Oscar worthy performance couldn't save this muddled film.",1202256000,,1584,4.666666666666667
2939115,4,B000VE43BC,"I love anything Latino. And having been to Puerto Rico (and am dating a boricua), I love anything that has to do with the culture. And I LOVE salsa!

I thought Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony did a really good job with this movie and I think Marc looked a LOT like the real Hector, having looked at Lavoe's picture hanging in my boyfriends apartment day after day... but where the movie fell short for me was, as some other reviewer pointed out, they did not delve deeply enough into the deaths of the main characters, nor did they allow us to bond with them and develop an emotional tie to them. However, I am buying this dvd because I love everything latino and it's fun to catch glimpses of places I was actually at when they shot on location in PR.

I also agree that it was not promoted properly. I don't think it ever made an appearance in the theatres where I live and we have a lot of latino's here too.",1201824000,,911,4.2298850574712645

I'm Puerto Rican and grew up in Brooklyn & this movie brought back memories of my childhood. As far as the guy who complained about the drug use, etc. - It's a biography - his talent is what endears you to him and who he was before the drugs. And yes - I did buy a used copy - no soy pendeja.",1201046400,,407,3.689655172413793
2939117,3,B000VE43BC,"This film was very interesting, but very mediocore.  It stars Jennifer Lopez as the late wife of the late singer from Puerto Rico, Hector Lavoe.  It also stars Jlo's husband Marc Anthony as Lavoe.

WARNING THERE MAY BE SOME SPOILERS

For those of you who don't know who Hector Lavoe was, he was a singer from Puerto Rico.  Might I also say that Marc Anthony played Hector very authentically, so realistically that I thought I was looking at the real Hector Lavoe.  And Jlo does a very good job of playing Hector's hotheaded wife Puchi.  So the acting wasn't bad.

Well onto the film.  At the beginging, Hector's dad threatens to disown him if he moves away to America.  Well certianly enough, Hector chases after his dream of making it big in the land of the free.  There he meets up with some people and they make a band together.  And there he also meets the love of his life, Puchi.  You had to admit it was really cute when Lavoe and Puchi were dancing together at the party.  And then when he had a hangover, she sat right next to him telling him not to die on her birthday.  Wow what a touching moment that was too.

Well anyways, this story was told from Puchi's side of the story.  She goes on to explain how Hector and her had troubling realitionship when it came to fighting, affairs with other girls, perhaps even men, drugs, Hector's sister getting into fights with Puchi.  But non the less, they loved each other.  All though I have to admit that I liked the part where Hector was supposted to get married to Puchi in the church and she went to his hotel room and they got married there instead.  All I can say is I don't know how Hector handled a difficult woman like that, but he's a real trooper!

It also tells about Hector's abuse of drugs, how his procrastanation lead to his manager quiting, his suicide attempt after he finds out that his son was accidently shot and killed by his best friend, and to the point where he finds out that he contracted AIDS in the 80s.

Now onto the Spanish and subtitles in this film. Also might I add that Jlo didn't speak very much Spanish in the film, but I have to at least give Marc credit for speaking more Spanish then Jlo.  Also since I know enough Spanish to get by, even without the subtitles I could understand most of the time what he was saying.  But what about the folks who don't know!  Uh oh!  But the subtitles for me where very average when it came to this film.  Although they did a cleaver job of translating the lyrics of the songs onto the screen.

The music was very enjoyable to listen too.

But one thing I do have to critise about the film, is where in the heck was Hector's childhood in the film?!  And at times it could be slow, perhaps even hard to understand.  But other then that it was a pretty ok film.  It wasn't the best film in the world, but it's a decent biography on Lavoe and Puchi.

I give credit to the actors and the director and producer for trying to make a decent, but overlooked film about Lavoe!

This was a good movie and with suprisingly good acting from Mark Anthony and Jennifer Lopez. Its a sad story of Hector Lavoe's pilgramage to the U.S. in search of a music carreer when he hooks up with partner and musician willie Colon and gets put on to Weed and Heroine. Ofcourse with prolonged use of drugs sends Lavoes life spiralling out of control. A good movie of Hector Lavoes life and strong.",1199145600,,550,4.51

But after i watched it,i REALLY liked it.
The script,the directing,especially acting... just wonderful. The story of famed Salsa singer Hector Lavoe (Marc Antony) is told from the perspective of his longtime wife Puchi (Jennifer Lopez).

2939121,1,B000VE43BC,I didn't know this man/singer and came away from the movie not caring to know him or caring about his life. The movie only showed us drugs and drink. Nothing that would endear us to him in spite of his personal problems. Lopez did a good job. I'll give here credit for that (she was a co producer of this movie) I wanted to stop in the middle of the DVD but persevered on thinking I was missing something that would be revealed. Nada....buy the sound track. Forget the DVD.,1197763200,2,473,4.266666666666667
2939122,4,B000VE43BC,"After watching J-Lo's last few movies, ahem, Gigli just to name one, i have found that she has done some bad roles. I was skeptical to even watch this movie because i thought i was just another J-Flop, but i was surprised, this is her best acting role since Selena,  she should be given an award for this movie. I am definitely going to buy this on DVD so i can watch it over and over.

One thing i did not like about the movie was that they showed too much of Hector Lavoe's drug use and not enough on how he started salsa. Its like they skipped over a huge section of his life which was starting the salsa music,  and went straight to his drug use days and in detail of him using the drugs.  I guess they had to make it hollywood and put as much drug use in it as they possibly could. It was still overall a good movie.",1197244800,,821,3.9878048780487805
2939123,3,B000VE43BC,"I'm a Puerto Rican who was raised in a sort of Puerto Rican ghetto yet these movie was not compelling at all. First of all it was more J-Ho than Marc- wasn't the movie about Hector? That and the ignorant accents used by Marc and JHo while they were impressive- that they could pull them off that is- annoyed me immensely- and I could see why there existence but they weren't really necessary. Also, the dialogue makes Puerto Ricans seem as if they have a lack of intelligence. This is a bad representation above all and is a negative portrayal of Hectors character- it might be accurate but it makes him seem deficient in many ways no wonder his and friends and family didn't support it. Some of you guys are too ethnocentric. Save ur money and buy this used.

*This is an edit- I saved this movie to show it to my Grandma (I showed it to four other people also) and was shocked to discover that it didn't have Spanish dubbing. I was thus unable to show it to her for she wouldn't understand. This makes this movie even more of a shame. I would have rated it a 2 if I noticed this sooner. I have never watched a Hollywood released CD that didn't have a Spanish version- they're all usually English, Spanish and French. Its very ironic that this movie based on Hispanic personas, with Hispanic actors and depicting a story of a certain generation (many peole of this generation who are still alive today do not speak the English language) would lack this. Its also a shame that with Jho and Marc as the main attractions this deficit wasn't addressed. Tisk!",1196985600,2,1555,4.437062937062937

""El Cantante"" covers Lavoe's adult life from his rise to fame & his success as a singer though the point of view of his wife, Puchi. I think the acting, screenplay, music, and cinematography were all excellent. The only major complaint about this movies was how TERRIBLY SLOW it was, which surprised me.",1195257600,2,508,4.839080459770115

2939127,1,B000VE43BC,"Although Mark Anthony's singing was superb, his acting was horrible.  I found the dialogue, directing, and cinematography almost amateur.  Like many entertainers Hector Lavoe was self-destructive and the movie conveyed that.  Unfortunately, that's all you walked away with.  Instead of endearing you to the man, his talent, and contribution to music you got more and more turned off by him as the movie progressed.

This could have been such a better movie about an amazing talent and time in Latin music.",1194825600,3,505,5.185185185185185

I think there were places where the movie could have gone more in-depth to have more of a narrative arc.  But, overall, I think Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony did a great job acting.  I'm usually not a JLO fan, but she really proved her mettle in this film, as she did in Selena.  Overall, I think they did much more right, than wrong in this film.  It's a shame the reviews were so bad--the movie doesn't justify such bad reviews.",1194566400,2,553,4.330097087378641
2939129,5,B000VE43BC,"I was pleasantly surprised with nicely played performances by Jenny and Marc.  Initially I thought they used their mega-star status to self-righteously misappropriate the portrayal of Hector's life.  In retrospect I cannot think of a duo more deserving or appropriate to see this work through with high marks.

For many this movie will strike a chord as the typical story of Puerto Rican tragedy for which apparently not even the biggest of Puerto Rican stars can escape.  The biopic documents Hector's humble beginnings in Puerto Rico, then his meteoric rise as a Salsa icon, to his downfall (literally from a hotel balcony).  The performances were both moving and compelling and the overall viewing experience leaving a lasting impression of El Cantante's life and contributions.

I was disappointed that the movie only mentioned in passing Hector's ""other"" children which aside from his musical legacy are the heirs of Lavoe's history.",1194393600,4,938,5.261744966442953
2939130,4,B000VE43BC,"EL CANTANTE missed in the theater run, perhaps because the public is growing weary of 'little person makes good, becomes a celebrity, and aborts a successful life in favor of drugs' stories. But now that the film is available for DVD viewing in the home, the public can appreciate the very fine qualities of this surprise work.  And it may not be too late for an Oscar nod for Jennifer Lopez...

The film is based on the life of Hector Lavoe (Marc Anthony), the Puerto Rican King of Salsa who gained fame and stardom in the 1970s and 1980s as not only a talented singer but also as a charismatic 'man of the people'.  His rise to fame is related in a tremendously effective black and white late in life interview with Hector's wife Puchi (a brilliant role for Jennifer Lopez!) offering in flashback sequences the rise and fall of the King of Salsa, a life cut short by both drug abuse and AIDS.  Much of the film is devoted to musical sequences that bristle with the excitement of Salsa music and Anthony carries his role as Lavoe very well.  The cast is uniformly excellent with some fine new faces.  Write/director Leon Ichaso lets the drama slip a bit in favor of the music, but still the performance of Jennifer Lopez as the smart but sleazy, tacky and wise Puchi is dynamite.  The film is far more solid than expected: the opportunity for Lopez to demonstrate her talent is well worth watching.  Grady Harp, November 07",1194048000,18,1424,4.53515625

Jennifer lopez did a great job playing Puchi! Marc anthony was OK as hector lavoe. i mean the film centered more around Puchi and JLO delivered the goods. Oscar worthy?? I can't really say but she was good. Perhaps golden globe worthy.
One thing for sure is that this isn't Swept Away. lol

I'd reccomend it for those who like salsa or latin music. I think this movie was overlooked when it was first released in the theatres since it didn't break any box office records. And that's an unfortunate thing! I'm guessing that most of Americans just didn't care for hector lavoe.

I don't know why, but when I heard Marc singing, I feel much more pain in his voice than in the real Lavoe. The brief performance of Victor Manuelle as Ruben Blades is amazing. That song really touch you.

I love Jennifer Lopez movies and so when I seen the preview for this movie I knew I had to see it!! For this to be Marc Anthony's first film he did a fabulous job portraying Hector Lavoe and I just loved watching him in this film!!

Jennifer Lopez did a fabulous job as well portraying Puchi I have never seen her take on this type of role before and she did a great job as well I'm never disappointed with her movies and I don't think you will be either!!

This film was very moving and riveting and I would highly recommend this film to anyone who loves true stories!! I think you will find that this movie is worth buying - I certainly did!!!",1193875200,,1095,4.27536231884058
2939135,4,B000VE43BC,"Let me start off by stating that I thought this was a very good biopic about the legendary Hector Lavoe.
Jennifer Lopez and Marc Anthony both did an excellent
job in their portrayals of Lavoe and the fiery Puchi
and the way it was shot, the music, etc. was very good too.
I wish they could've been more detailed about the deaths
of Hector himself of AIDS in 1993, Hector and Puchi's son,
young Hector Jr., who was killed in a gun accident in 1987,
as well as Puchi's own tragic death in 2002.
That's my only sore spot.
The real problem lies in whomever they chose to distribute
and promote this film! When it came out it was in very limited
release and virtually non-exsistent in secondary market theatres!--
-Where I live (Orlando, FL), where there is a very
large latino community
(many of which are northern transplants
of Puerto Rican, Dominican & Cuban descent!)
there was abosolutely nowhere you
could go see this movie on it's opening weekend!
The only way that I got to see it was through a bootleg,
but this movie, if handled right, could have done much better!
Even now, though it's being released to DVD on Tuesday
October 30th, you haven't seen or heard any advertisements
on TV about it's release!--WTF??--Anywayz, I hope that it gets
the love that it deserves from the DVD buying/renting public,
because it's a great story and well done I might add!
I hope a film on the early days of salsa comes out
about Tito Puente / Celia Cruz / Mongo Santamaria/ La Lupe, etc.
that captures that time in the early 50's in NYC when all
of this music was being created. A biopic about any one of
those figures needs to be done. These stories need to be
told and passed on to younger generations and people
who may like salsa music, but never knew where it came from!
