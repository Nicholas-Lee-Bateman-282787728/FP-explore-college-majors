More than entertainers, they are a part of our lives.",1396224000,,285,5.690476190476191

Eventhough I was a toddler when most of these movies where made I can sincerely appreciate the true CLEAN entertainment found in all three of these films. In these three movies you have the rare opportunity of experiencing the pleasure of being entertained by some of the most talent men and women in showbiz history. If you liked any of the members of the Rat Pack you'll love these movies. My wife is not a big rat pack fan but, she and my kids both loved each movie. My kids especially loved the ""Three Stooges"" appearance in ""Four for Texas"". And they also enjoyed the ""Red Skelton"" appearance in Ocean Eleven.
My wife couldn't believe how young Angie Dickenson looked in OE 11 and we both got a kick out of Shirley McClain.
In Robin and the Seven Hoods they all shine. Peter Faulk is terrific. Its the first movie I've seen with Sinatra wearing that awesome hat! And Sammy really put on a great number. My one son loves singing ""My Kinda Town"".
Overall if you are one of these so called ""serious"" movie critics I wouldn't recommend this one...(Stick to Citizen Kane). But, if you like movies where you can have ""fun"" watching, laugh, sing and cry. These are the movies for you!
I sure hope Clooney,Pit & Julia can pull off a good remake of OE 11. Hopefully, it will entice people to buy this original.",1005091200,5,1462,4.479400749063671
7850050,4,6303534325,"Ocean's Eleven & Robin and the Seven Hoods are classics.  The other one, I can do without.  If that movie was left out, this review would have been given 5 stars.
Ocean's Eleven is a great flick.  Any die hard Rat  Pack fan should have this in their collection.  Filming by day, Summit  meetings by night, this is what the Rat Pack was all about!
Robin and the  Seven Hoods is just a tremendous movie, it seems that everybody in  Hollywood is in it.  You have a good story, good song and dance numbers,  and comedy, you can't miss.
As a side note, that one review down the  bottom of the page that says the title of this gift pack is missleading, is  offbase.  The title says, this is a gift set and lists the 3 movies that  are in it.  Nowhere does it say that it is a compilation of Rat Pack  moments from onstage.",953856000,3,816,4.134615384615385
