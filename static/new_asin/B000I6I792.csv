  These people fear because they see black church folks (whom they hate and fear as White Supremacists) dance and sing and their KKK demons become frightened and want to stomp out praise to God. So sad.",1236643200,5,430,4.958333333333333
8144246,4,B000I6I792,"The Hollywood establishment doesn't usually pretend that the historical movies studios make are supposed to be historically accurate.  However, there are times that a movie comes out of the studio machines intended to influence and alter people's opinions about a particular event or a certain set of ideas.  The movie INHERIT THE WIND, as well as the play of the same name that the film was adapted from, is an example of such a film.  The movie portrays the events of the infamous Scopes trial--a trial that was purposely set up as a test case for certain individuals who had an agenda to force their beliefs into the public education system.  This DVD illustrates the differences between the famed Hollywood film and the historical record and how the film purposely distorted events and characters in order to discredit those with religious beliefs and portray the people who brought about the case as heroes.  I found the material of the presentation on this DVD to be quite interesting.  I'd recommend this DVD for anyone who has an interest in the Scopes trial as well as a tool in media literacy for anyone who is interested in how movies sometimes are used to purposely influence the ideas and attitudes of the general populace.",1199232000,10,1236,4.834123222748815

While Hollywood's entertainment has rarely claimed to be historically accurate, I thought his presentation was nontheless interesting and informative - a worthwhile hour for any student of history.",1183852800,11,367,5.796296296296297
8144248,1,B000I6I792,This dvd makes a great coaster to put your cold drinks on. Thats about all its good for. Id is just not science. Read Richard Dawkins if you want real Science. Answers in Genesis is where evolution is outlawed and the monkeys are in charge.,1174435200,,240,4.355555555555555
