She has diversified her repertoire over the years to include some songs in english.  One of them is called ""Along The Watchtower"".

She is a total powerhouse throughout the entire show. Easy to see why her career has lasted so long.",1503187200,,508,6.552238805970149

8619983,5,B00G0RU0P2,I had many doubts about buying this concert and after watching the doubts vanished completely.  Many of the new songs I had never heard but are instantly catchy.  The sound is just incredible and make this concert experience well worth your time.,1396742400,3,246,4.833333333333333
8619984,4,B00G0RU0P2,"Finally a Blu ray of this great Mexican singer !
The quality is great ! The sound is better ! The concept is an intimate concert. The song selection was great. The new songs are good ! Could be a greats hits ,if the label decided to make it a singles to the radio.

The music: the new song,
Como Ladrones.- the best song of La Guzman in many years..
Quitatelo.-  a  Catchy song,but, Beatriz Luengo has a nice voice.but, who is she ?a complete stranger in Latinamerica.
Yo no soy the nadie.- eehh, ummh, a colombian rhythm , no my favorite. Fonseca, not a fan.",1395187200,,559,4.254716981132075
