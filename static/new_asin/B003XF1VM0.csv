It begins with a view of a rocky beach. There is a big house on a cliff overlooking the sea. Christine thought she heard a mans voice, he ex-husband Paul. Mrs. Faver gets a telephone call from a friend, Martin Abbot. She will walk over there. A man talks to her, Alexis, Psychic Consultant. Martin joins her at her home. They talk. At night she dreams; did she hear a voice? Will she see a ghost? Chris screams then faints. It was a bad dream says her friend. Should she seek help? She goes to see Alexis, and continues to do so. Her friends go to see a Private Detective who investigates psychics; he knows all their tricks. Can Janet investigate him?

A two-way mirror allows viewing, sensitive paper copies her written question. Can he read her mind? Yes. She offers him a cigarette from her case. He puts his fingerprints on that case and wins her confidence! [A lesson here?] Our client is hooked good. Another older woman visits. Alexis inspects her jewelry. Janet tells Chris to avoid Alexis and explains why. Janet ties his hands and he gets into a cabinet. A ghostly luminous hand floats in the darkness! Then there is a portrait of a man. A tape recorder plays music, ghostly figures appear! [We see how these tricks are done.] A figure appears near the door. Nobody was up there! Later there is a surprise! I can use you. Who burned to death in your car?

Alexis visits Christines house for another seance. He talks to Janet outside, they become friendly. Ive come for you dear says Paul. She follows him to the cliff, then falls! Can she be saved? Martin arrives and offers help to Christine, but is refused. Janet hears the noise from a record and goes to investigate. She sees the hidden speaker! She finds the hidden room with Paul. Paul threatens her with a pistol, but Alexis acts to save her! Paul shoots at Alexis. The Police arrive to conclude this performance. Janet thanks Alexis, he offers advice.

This movie starts slowly but develops into a clever plot. It is important for its educational value, then. Nowadays few people believe in magic like psychics. Can some people read minds? Yes. Right now I can read your mind, and you are thinking I cant do it. Now you're thinking what I did was obvious, and wondering what Im going to say next. Now you think Ive come to the end of this act and will quit. Am I right?",1412035200,,2368,4.474537037037037
