1089820,2,6305944539,"Well, you win a few and you lose a few. With half the reviewers giving this DVD 5 stars and the other half giving it 2 stars, I knew it would be a bit of a gamble.  Don't get me wrong: the DVD looks and sounds terrific but the Godfather of Soul is only there in body but sadly not in spirit. The band cooks, the backup singers and dancers work their butts off but  the Hardest Working Man in Showbusiness sleepwalks his way through the show.",1076371200,3,441,4.057471264367816
1089821,2,6305944539,"I recently saw JB live in Tulsa.. the show was absolutely amazing.
This dvd is basically just a terrible, watered down version of the concert I saw..
The songs listed on the back cover are a sad trick..
Most of them are 10 second high speed [garbage] versions - its disgusting.
Better try your luck on some of the Godfather's older stuff.
Sorry JB.",1026604800,5,348,4.453125
1089822,2,6305944539,"The quality of the cinematography is great (the reason for two stars instead of one), but the concert isn't up to par.  Here is why:  the band sounds great and Brown rips them out pretty decently, but the songs are too quick. Don't be impressed by the cool setlist on the back cover, because JB only plays about 30 seconds to a minute of each song before going into the next.  THE CONCERT IS ONE BIG MEDLEY!  You don't get a full song in the bunch.  I am a huge fan of soul and funk (I DJ a top-rated funk radio show), so when I admit that it is bad, is must be REALLY bad!",1012176000,2,573,3.9478260869565216
1089823,2,6305944539,"I love James Brown, and this current package is sad. The band is tight and the sound is good, but it's like he walks through the whole show giving brief nods to various songs in his career.
 He has gotten old, and has lost his vocal power. He does try
to put on a good show, but the magic is gone.
 I hope someone puts together a nice package of live clips at some point, that shows what this great man was. It really pains me to be writing this, so if you don't want to be disappointed, avoid this one.",1011484800,13,503,3.9702970297029703
1089824,2,6305944539,"Sorry, but all the songs sound the same on this disc! I love ""Living in America"" but the version on this disc fall flat. Keep looking if you want to hear the songs like you remember them from the radio!",1010448000,,202,4.075
1089825,5,6305944539,This is Mr. Brown's best video. I happened to be there for the concert and I can tell you he tore the house up!!!. I'm so glad the tape captured the excitement of the live show. This is a must for any J. B. fan! He truly is a legend in his own time!!,970876800,4,250,3.6481481481481484
1089826,4,6305944539,"The '68 to '74 JB is highlighted with lesser-discussed items like  ""Popcorn"" [""Mother Popcorn""], ""Gimme Some  More"" (performed by BitterSweet), ""If I Ruled The World"",  ""Soul Power"", and ""Papa Don't Take No Mess"". Two of  these titles deserved more than the passing glance they received but the  whole program is well-paced and heavily features backup performers - the  set opens with diva-esque protege Tomi Rae performing a powerful blues-soul  ballad ""I Still Care"" and the J. Joplin ""Try"". In  consideration of the venue name I had hoped that JB would do some straight  ahead blues like he did with B.B. King on another outstanding video JB AND  HIS VERY SPECIAL GUEST B.B.KING (something like ""The Things That I  Used To Do"" or ""Home Again""), but Candice Hurst emerges from  stage left and delivers the goods with the jazz/blues ""Why Don't You  Do Right"" with style. The consumer may wonder about his energy level  (at age approx. 66), but except for the occasional reliance on  aforementioned contributors plus Roosevelt Johnson (who sings on ""Soul  Power"" and the presumed tribute to the Blues Brothers, ""Soul  Man""), he is the vital artist we've watched over the years. In fact,  his dancing is better here than on some video efforts from the 1980's!  Another selling point is the inclusion of the heavy hip-hopp ""Funk On  A Roll"" from the recent I'M BACK album. With all due respect to the  talented all-Female backup group BitterSweet, I feel that the tune is more  effective with (apparently) all Male singers in unison as on the CD. Still,  it is a great selection. I hope James Brown continues to mix in unexpected  numbers in his live act and on record (and hopefully on video!).",968457600,4,1693,4.839160839160839
1090055,5,6305944539,"""Mr. Dynamite"", ""Soul Brother Number One"", ""The Godfather of Soul"". This DVD is a must have. James is up in age in this DVD but his ""BAND"" and his back ground singers ""BITTER SWEET""  helps keep the energy up and gives you a  live concert that will keep you dancing and singing every time this DVD is viewed. I'm old school and has been a J.B fan for  many, many,years. This DVD is hard to come by since his death, so pickup one whenever you can.

1090058,5,6305944539,"This is an excellent entertainment DVD.  In the twilight of James Brown's career, he still had the showmanship and class I can appreciate over and over again.  He gives us a melody of familiar tunes like ""Hot Pants"", ""If I Ruled the World"", ""Prisoner of Love"" and more.  You will be entertained by his dancing alone and with the members of his back up dancers.  I purchased other James Brown DVDs and this is one I appreciate the best due to the quality picture of the video and the range of songs included over his career. He was one of our greatest entertainers and his energy is unmistakeble.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/James-Brown-House-of-Blues/dp/6305944539/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">James Brown: House of Blues</a>",1291507200,,764,5.6173913043478265

1090060,5,6305944539,"I saw this performance shown on the HD NET. It was filmed at the House of Blues, but not the one in Hollywood. It shows Brown at his best and should be a collectible for everyone who liked his work. I have ordered it on DVD but as yet it hasn't arrived. He did his best work at this performance and he is truly missed. I think you would enjoy watching it over and over, as I will. As we age we all lose our favorite entertainers. But, when they have recorded their work, they will live on.",1268524800,,489,4.0
1090061,5,6305944539,"A great watch...those who want to be Monday Morning Quarterbacks and say he has sounded better ..well the man still is the GodFather.
He still has the moves and the energy which make this video a great watch. The quality of the video in high def and audio are excellent. His band and back of dancers smoke and sound tight as they ever did. Dont hesitate if you are a JB fan. You cant go wrong.",1255651200,,393,4.184210526315789
1090062,1,6305944539,I TRIED TO PLAY THE DVD ON THREE DIFFERENT VIDEO SYSTEMS AND THE RESULTS ON ALL THREE WERE THE SAME.  THE VIDEO PORTION WAS DISTORTED AND SKIPPED FRAMES.  THE AUDIO ALSO SKIPPED.  I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED IN THIS PURCHASE.,1179100800,,221,4.615384615384615
1090063,2,6305944539,"Set list looks good...but the performance is surprisingly limited.  After watching this several times, I've forced myself to enjoy it more.  After the death of Mr. Brown, I hold it as a great memory from when I saw him last February.

James Brown is simply not into this show.  He's in a rush to get outta there and it shows.  He rushes through every song.  The ballads are simply him singing about 20-30 seconds until he motions to his band to move on to the next song.  Songs where you can't wait to see and hear like ""I Feel Good"" and ""Papa's Got A Brand New Bag"" are shamelessly too short.  I'm not sure what the audience felt, but watching this I was upset and frustrated that he did not give each song the respect, credit and time they each deserved.

Yes he is in his 60's and that is not at all a problem.  His moves are still pretty good.  My only reason for watching this DVD are for 2 numbers: ""Get Up Offa That Thing"" and ""Soul Man"".  He shines throughout these songs and only these, in my opinion.  There are moments where he can't sing the high notes and heavily relies on his backup singers.

I don't really recommend this DVD---at least for this price $12-$17.  I bought mine for $5 and it's definitely worth that.  Dont' pay more than $7 or you will be sorely dissapointed and regretful.",1167177600,5,1304,4.3264462809917354
1090064,5,6305944539,"Just listen to James Brown's superhit ""Sex Machine"" and feel the power of music, the perfect harmony between the band members, vocals and dancers. James Brown is still the Godfather of soul music, very active and carismatic. Great audience reacting superbly with the music.. Even Sharon Stone attended this amazing concert. Enjoy this DVD, with both 5.1 dolby digital sound and picture excellent qualities, and for all James Brown's fans, this DVD is a must for your music library.",1133481600,,481,5.10126582278481

Don't want to get ""scandalous"", but if you have never seen Tomi Rae Hynie (Brown) perform, she does the first two opening songs. I know, I have never seen her perform except on this DVD.

7897851,1,6305944539,"I rarely write reviews trashing products so this one is an exception.

When I purchased this ""thing"" from a retail outlet, JB was still alive. At the time there wasn't much product available locally or on Amazon.com in terms of DVDs of JB when he was really in his heyday. I purchased this when JB was 70; three years before he died.

As a Vegas show featuring an aged legend of JB's stature this revue is a mockery. This shameful spectacle while technically glossy in terms of the audio and musical proficiency of the stage band, they essentially reduce JB to being a mascot.

Probably the most annoying part of the affair were those damn cheerleaders ... uh ... dancers.

If you want a better JB concert experience, seek out his older stuff here on Amazon.com.",1401494400,,762,4.580882352941177
