The killer is mysterious and you don't see his face until the very end of the movie much similar to Maniac Cop whom Z'Dar was cast as a result of this movie.  The chanting that Sommers does along with the painting of the faces is how he steals the victims souls and gains their strength.  In the end, Sommers was nearly invincible and of course there is the question of is he really dead at the end.  Too bad they didn't make a sequel to this or a remake.  The Night Stalker is also loosely based on Richard Ramirez with some similarities such as the victims with their faces painted and a link to the occult.  A definite watch for Z'Dar fans!!!

8077593,1,B000AC7OW0,"honestly i was a bit confused by this movie-i mean okay it's a cop movie and hey,not a bad one at that but at no time did anyone ""stalk"" the night.the killer guy stalked a lot of young women but no night-i mean really!!i don't ask for much in movies called night stalker except that at least once they stalk the bloody night.there are at least ten movies that i've seen along with two tv series called nightstalker with no nightstalking,sure crap happens at night but where's my lunatic running around with a knife screaming profainity at the darkness.i'll tell you where ,nowhere the big zipporooni on the stalking the night.as a cop movie it's great but if your expecting even one curse word or knife slash at the night-your simply out of luck.so turn the dvd player off,throw out the popcorn and pull your hand out of your pants as a nightstalking movie this one fails the sniff test,cop movie;A nightslking movie;F.hollywood pay attention there are those of us who long for a movie where the nutball with the knife drops to his knees and scresms""night,one day you'll be mine!!!"" and really mean it,now that's a nightstalker movie,hollywood are you paying attention ? come on people, who's with me??",1284595200,2,1202,4.728571428571429
8077594,3,B000AC7OW0,"This is not part of the night stalker tv series.  Its a cheesy 80's cop/horror movie that is somewhat entertaining.  I will say this, it has the greatest on foot police chase of all time.  It lasts about five minutes and the cops are possible the slowest runners ever.  I couldn't stop laughing, but I don't think it was supposed to be funny.",1171670400,7,342,4.380952380952381
