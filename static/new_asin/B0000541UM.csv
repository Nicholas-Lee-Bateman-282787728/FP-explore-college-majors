8173553,5,B0000541UM,"This great DVD, a sequel of sorts to ""The Great Animation Studios - Fleischer Studios"" also from Winstar/Audio Galaxy, is a real treat for animation lovers. I quite enjoyed the Popeye, Little Lulu and Herman cartoons, they were a blast and looked and sounded better than the copies currently on the market, and I just could not resist following the bouncing ball and singing along with the great Screen Songs on this disc. The history of the studio was also a fascinating read, and gave me a better appreciation of the animation world in the 40's and 50's. These are the 'toons your mom and pop grew up with, and now you can see them for yourself. Great DVD, a must buy.",1413244800,,670,4.5
8173554,3,B0000541UM,"Famous Studios was to Paramount what Looney Tunes was to Warner Brothers and Disney was to...Disney, I guess. The Famous Studios cartoons, however, just weren't very good. The best were from Popeye, and other characters (Little Lulu, Baby Huey) had a few winners, but overall, the studio's output was sub-par. The best cartoons on this disc are Popeye's ""Out to Punch"" and the reasonably engaging bouncing-ball cartoon ""The Mild West."" (""The Mild West"" is one that I fondly remember from my childhood, so I may be biased).
Unlike some of the DVDs from the Cartoon Crazys series, this one looks a bit smeary and scratchy, and some of the colours are faded. Like the rest of the Cartoon Crazys DVDs, new sound effects have been added, and they strike me as being a little on the distracting side. Included on the DVD is some interesting information about Famous Studios.",1089072000,3,868,4.832214765100671
