4510809,5,B004ZZDYDG,Qualty Video! Good Instruction for building an AR-15! Jim Van Middles worth is a good instuctor and for under $20.00 it s a real bargain!,1339027200,,137,4.52
4510810,5,B004ZZDYDG,"I've owned a few AR15s.  I always wanted to build my own and to learn what tools would best serve me in building this gun.  I'm very detailed oriented and I've always believed in having the right tools for the job. The time you invest in preparation and tooling makes your builds more consistent and of a higher quality.  This video showed me a lot more than just how to build the rifle.  It showed me how things worked, what tools can be substituted for each other and it showed me some great equipment to protect the investment in building the gun.

I really liked the pace of the video.  It was very informative and it moved along pretty quickly.

The video quality was excellent.  That came in handy given the number of highly detailed close-up shots of small parts and functions.

This video is money well spent.",1339027200,,817,4.466216216216216
4510811,4,B004ZZDYDG,"This video is well made on the content side. It is, however, poorly made on the video quality side. The work area seems to be a room in a factory. During the video one can hear the banging of machinery running. At times one can hear workers talking in the background. The backdrop of the movie is a piece of cloth that seems as though it could fall at any time.

Now for the gun content. The video is very informative. I enjoyed the person that continously asked questions off the screen. Many were the exact questions that I had. The knowledge if the person actually doing the work was exceptional. He took the time to point out the parts that were being discussed, usually with a punch as a pointer.

Overall, I would buy it again, and would recomend it.",1337472000,52,756,4.3546099290780145
4510812,5,B004ZZDYDG,"Searched all over for a book instructing how to build a AR15. Carried M16 in Nam but that was long ago 1966. Basic was M14, AIT was M16. This video was helpful but to fast in some areas. Could not figure out how to restart video in middle of a chapter. Yes it will help you assemble a AR15. Video showed some good assembly tricks.",1335916800,,330,4.092307692307692
4510813,5,B004ZZDYDG,another find dvd in the series. a must have for any ar  owner . cheaper than a gunsmith and alot more fun,1334620800,,105,3.772727272727273
4510814,5,B004ZZDYDG,This video is a must have . I started my first ar15 build with out any experience . This video walks you through the process leaving nothing out. Excellent,1332374400,,155,4.379310344827586
4510815,4,B004ZZDYDG,you learn how to assemble an ar 15 from scratch. video is detailed enough so long as you are smart as a high school freshman I think you can build your own from this video. I have not seen any other videos on this subject so I have nothing to compare it to.,1330560000,,257,3.8679245283018866
4510816,5,B004ZZDYDG,Clear and concise.  This was put together excellently.  I knew absolutely nothing about bulding AR-15rifles.  After this I felt like a gunsmith.  Can't wait for my first build,1330214400,3,175,5.142857142857143
4510817,5,B004ZZDYDG,"Finally a video that has included ALL the tips necessary to work on and add accessories without damaging the finish of the rifles. It is NOT a ""DRY"" boring video, it is a two person conversation with explanations and questions being asked. He shares the tools that are necessary to complete the task at hand but will not cost you a fortune to acquire. I have seen MANY Ar 15s come in that have scratches because of improper tools being added.
This video is hosted by a master armorer and it is quickly obvious he knows what he is doing! You will not be disappointed with this product. Don't let the 3 hr lenght detour your purchase. It is set up in ""chapters"" allowing the opportunity to stop and start over without loosing your place.  VERY satisfied.",1326412800,72,752,4.489051094890511
4510818,5,B004ZZDYDG,"If you're looking to build your first AR-15 or even if you've already built one, this video will provide you valuable tips, tricks and insight into the How and Why of building and maintaining your AR-15. I scoured the web - forums, YouTube and major retailers for info, and there is tons of it out there. The only problem is that you'll spend lots of time trying to figure out what is good or bad practice, especially if you're new at all this AR-15 building business. Well, look no further, because this DVD puts it all together for you using a Master AR-15 Armorer as your instructor. Unlike a major web retailer that offers free videos and trying to sell you tools and gadgets, this instructional DVD spends more time on the How and Why you need to do the things you do when building your AR-15. I highly recommend you give this DVD a chance - you'll be glad you did. You may also want to pick up a copy of the ""M4 Carbine-M16A2 W/E Armorer's Guide"" by Desert Publications as a reference resource after your build.

Here's a breakdown of the DVD Chapters:

Intro - This is an brief intro to the AR-15, the extensive background of the instructor, and what the DVD will teach you

Opening Comments - a conversation with the instructor discussing major components/quality/choices, discussion of the lower receiver and what to look for in a quality lower receiver, how to select a quality lower parts kit and a detailed explanation of all the parts in it

Lower Receiver - detailed explanation of the assembly of the lower parts kit into the lower receiver, the sequence of parts installation and why that sequence is important, some specialized tools (and how to make them yourself), other tips and tricks, what to do and what not to do and why, alternate methods to install roll pins, installation of buffer, spring, butt stock.

Upper Receiver - discussion of the different types of uppers and how to decide which type to select for your build, an explanation of the basic parts needed for the upper receiver assembly and their function, whether to buy a built upper or a stripped upper and separate parts (ejection port assembly, forward assist parts), how to install the parts, he also explains the use of an upper receiver vise block if you have one.

Barrel/Gas System - discussion of barrel types/prices and how to choose one, determining quality, barrel length, rate of twist, accuracy determinants, discussion of gas systems/lengths, A2 FSB discussion, barrel extension timing explanation, explanation of the bolt carrier and function with the barrel, checking the crown of the barrel, muzzle brake/flash hider sizing/selection, specialized tools to drill the gas hole and install an A2 FSB (taper pin explanation) and hand guard ring if you don't buy a completed barrel, detailed barrel installation, gas tube installation, muzzle brake timing/installation, hand guard installation

Bolt Carrier Group - explanation of bolt carrier group (BCG) and gas system operation, BCG function with the barrel and assembly/disassembly, extractor inspection/cleaning, BCG gas ring replacement.

Gas Blocks/Final Assembly - explanation of different types of gas blocks available, discussion/installation of Magpul MOE Handguards, discussion/installation of free-float handguards, final assembly of charging handle, bolt carrier group and upper receiver to lower receiver. Enjoy your new AR-15.

Buy the DVD, you won't regret it.",1318550400,152,3425,5.069271758436945

4510828,1,B004ZZDYDG,Bad DVD format.  Requires you to install an application on your PC to view and that only runs on out of date systems.  I could not get it to play even using the backwards compatibility mode.  You can find better DIY videos for building your AR for free on YouTube.

4510835,3,B004ZZDYDG,"I am going to review this video as I progress through it. At the 30 min mark, Jim is inserting a roll pin and talking about how short the punch is and how he just made an extension out of a piece of steel. Don't know about you but I do not have a machine shop let alone the kind of steel he 's talking about to make his extension.  Just had to share that I do not mind getting the proper tools but that is going a bit far for an instructional video on something that is advertised as ""...all you need is some mechanical aptitude."" to build a kit.

4510838,4,B004ZZDYDG,"For brand newbies w/ out internet access, very helpful. He left out/ignored one important factor about the AR's trigger pull mechanism that come with the springs kit. There is no slack movement. There should be warning and options provided. I then realize why there are so many upgrade AR triggers kits available. However, with about 3-4 lbs. springs kit, it is pretty good. Have fun and be safe!",1492473600,,396,4.838235294117647

4510858,5,B004ZZDYDG,"Very knowledgeable walk-through of the process.  Labels each part at the beginning, which is helpful.  Discusses tools, alternatives to installing parts with pros and cons, and gives his opinion of how best to tackle difficult steps.  I especially liked the reference to the detent pin tool.  I'm convinced I would've sent mine across my shop, had I not seen it.  And the arbor press recommendation (though what was that aquamarine piece he used during the lower assembly?)

There is banter between the presenter and the cameraman.  I was distracted at first, but realized the cameraman was proving a ""man on the street"" take with questions and comments.  I think this makes the video very accessible for the novice.  I'm fine with the production quality, given the subject matter.

I'm very familiar with the AR-15/M-16 and I've completed projects like swapping barrels and tinkering on other guns.  I feel I could use this video and the proper tools to assemble an AR-15.",1482969600,2,973,4.9813664596273295

4510869,5,B004ZZDYDG,"This video is as close as you can get to sitting down with a patient, knowledgable armorer and having him show you everything about properly assembling an AR rifle. Step by step by step. Practically nothing is overlooked-- and it is not just a guy droning on and on... the camera man is ""playing dumb,"" and making sure that the whole process is an involving conversation. Whenever the armorer might skip something, the camera jumps in and asks, ""what about this, or that?"" Just to make sure nothing is missed. It is a simple, effective, very easy format. Lots of close ups, detailed step by step explanations... it's just like you're there and an expert is coaching you. Fantastic.

It could be improved-- for instance, during the build process, there are several recommendations for specific tools and techniques. The DVD could provide an on-screen list of these tools, or teletype them on the screen during the talking, so we can pause and write them down. But, that is what AR books are for... and, like a good class, you are free to take your own notes while watching.

Also this is not an ""advanced"" customization-oriented video. This is a fundamental build-from-scratch video. However, I guarantee that even experienced AR owners will learn something new, get a few great tips, or ""remember"" something they forgot a while back... I know I did... learned a lot! Worth every penny.

If you are having trouble building, or don't have the skills or patient to teach a child, friend, or colleague... try this. Watch it together.",1471392000,2,1529,4.82824427480916

The reason that it get only 2 stars is that a couple of important items are left out. First is.the testing of the trigger group. Second.is checking the head space on the bolt. Checking the head space on the bolt should be done before the barrel is installed, it makes it so much easier. Both of these are a must for a safe and reliable rifle.

I've combed through tens, if not hundreds, of hours of YouTube videos on building, maintaining, and cleaning of AR15 rifles, and can positively attest, this is the best visual resource out there. If you are a visual/auditory learner, you will find this course worth your time and money. With so many ""expert"" opinions on the web, to have a true armorer walk you through every step of the build process is extremely helpful. Keeping from making costly mistakes, due to lack of knowledge or experience, is priceless. The only thing I wish this video was accompanied by is the list of tools the instructor used for assembling the rifle.

4510903,4,B004ZZDYDG,"With low tech production values, being shot in a factory against a crookedly hung tarp, it still is a terrific DVD for its content.  Far better than AGI for angles and closeups, this Master Armorer clearly knows what works and warns you away from what does not work to assemble your AR-15.  There is an emphasis on using the right tools, even to using tools that the home workshop will not have (like a hydraulic press), but he does this type of thing for a living and can do a lower receiver assembly in 30-minutes using all the right tools.  The information is first class, down to earth, and generic in that he doesn't specify any brand name, even though he clearly works for a specific company (JD) that manufactures forged receivers, both uppers and lowers.  I think anyone that has the desire to assemble their own AR-15 would be well served to watch this set of videos.  It might make you think that this is something you want to attempt - it also might steer you away from doing your own work as it did me.  It depends on your own skills -  and your own willingness to admit your true skill set as well as your tool set.  Hours of good information is here for the taking, whether or not you decide to roll your own.  The videographer talks and asks questions throughout, which is both helpful and somewhat distracting, causing the armorer to say ""Right"" about fifty times, a distraction in itself; this also caused him to lose his trend of thought a few times too, but he picked up where he left off without missing more than a beat or two, something that can be attributed to his expert knowledge of the AR-15 platform.  He can build an AR for me anytime and I am convnced that it would be done exactly right - he is a true Master Armorer where the AR-type platform is concerned.",1449014400,3,1788,4.390909090909091

4510995,2,B004ZZDYDG,"This is not the best instructional video for the casual builder.  I wonder who the target audience is?  I only buy a stripped lower receiver if it is absolutely necessary because I hate building these.
The gunsmith can build a stripped lower receiver because he has so many tools dedicated to building a stripped lower.  He must have about a $thousand worth of equipment, such as an arbor press (what is that?), slave pins, roll pin starter, etc.  I think the equipment would be worth it if you build these constantly, but I only do a build once every two years and I can't justify all of that equipment.
I wish this video would show how to do a build without all of the fancy equipment (especially how to install the bolt catch).  This is a good video for a gunsmith but not for the casual builder.",1409270400,3,799,4.408163265306122

First off, Jim is very personable, knowledgeable, and a joy to learn from. He knows his stuff very well and is highly seasoned (as is apparent.)
Secondly, I really enjoy his teaching style. Despite being on DVD, you feel as if he's in the classroom teaching YOU personally! Lenny does a great job interjecting when needed and the angles are covered well. Jim comes across as a humble likable guy that you'd want to have a drink with (and pay for the drinks.)
Finally, (this matters) a lot of people can ""tell"" you what to do in a perfect world, that is, if nothing goes wrong. Jim details the common pitfalls and precautions, thus saving you from screwing up a lot of stuff. And trust me, you'd screw up.",1406505600,,737,4.466666666666667

They covered all topics from scratch (as they said), assembling an AR-15 step by step.  The narrator asked numerous useful questions as the assembly progressed and the demonstrator gave lots of tips, tricks and warnings about ways you might mess up so you can avoid them.

Even with the assembly of the smallest of parts, somehow that camera man got in there to show the assembly very clearly.

While I don't have the process memorized, if you gave me all of the parts and this video, I am positive I could assemble the AR-15 successfully.

4511034,4,B004ZZDYDG,"This video is a very good guid on building your AR-15.  Overall the quality of the production is good, and the information contained in it is excellent.  It is very clear that Jim VanMiddlesworth has built his fair share of AR pattern rifles and has a wealth of experience.  Now, the good, and the bad:

The Good:
Jim's knowledge and the amount he shares throughout the video is excellent.  Well worth the price of the video.
If you pay attention you should absolutely be able to build your AR without an issue.
Jim is very good at explaining and articulating the points he is making and the tips he is sharing.

The Bad:
The post-production is pretty poor.  Spelling errors in the menus, navigation issues jumping between areas and chapters.
The banter with the camera person or whomever is sitting there with him is terribly annoying.  The conversation adds nothing to the points being shared other than it being useless chatter with that background person.  The problem with this is that if you are just trying to get to the point and learn as much as possible as fast as possible the banter is a nuisance.

Overall this video is worthwhile.  They could make a revised edition and simply fix the post issues and not do the banter next time and have a perfect training video on building an AR-15 from scratch.",1390262400,6,1311,4.607758620689655
4511035,4,B004ZZDYDG,"This is a great video series, but if you plan on doing your own build based on this, beware!!

You need to invest in some special tools to do a proper build, and they tell you that in the video.  Everything is easy to understand, but I would chalk this up to being highly informational.  I'll save my money on the hardware and pay a gunsmith to properly build mine.",1389225600,,365,4.185714285714286
4511036,3,B004ZZDYDG,"Two things about the most helpful critical evaluation of this DVD:  One, these men are not professional actors, although,, they might have done better had they hired one to do the speaking and instructions instead of doing it themselves;  Two,  gun fans, like all people, are proud of what they know and love to demonstrate this.  Any subject known to man, can be found online with some nitwit or an actual professional and knowledgeable person online explaining their subject,

  Gun nuts, I mean this not in a bad way, love to talk about what they know.  So, yes, you are right, most of the time the tape is spent wasted, because these men did not do the practice runs first. Or did not do the instructions enough time and then edit the best of each part into a semi-professionally done DVD.  Next time hire and actor, or someone who knows that we want the information not the chit-chat you two think is so cool.  The information is great.

4511043,5,B004ZZDYDG,"Thank you, thank you, thank you! It would be very difficult to over-emphasize how good this video is. Im amazed. Maybe its because of all the ridiculously poor YouTube junk Im used to watching, but this video went WAY beyond what I expected, both in terms of detail of information, but also in quality of presentation and production. It is NOTHING like anything on YouTube. It truly is excellent. By the way, I cannot believe people complained about the machine shop noises going on in the background  sheesh! I did not find that objectionable in the slightest.

This video is so good, I see no need whatever for any additional material, such as books, etc. for a novice to build an AR from scratch. After watching, I have no un-answered questions. Everything was explained in fine detail and in a very understandable way. I assumed I would use this video to supplement a good book or manual, but really, there is no need for anything else. Collect all the parts in a big pile on your bench, and just follow the video, pausing as necessary. This video shows how to assemble an AR from scratch. The upper and lower are totally stripped. There is no need to buy anything pre-assembled. The video clearly shows each and every little spring, detent, and part and how to assemble them.

This DVD made me realize how much better the video format is compared to a book or manual. For instance, Jim Van Middlesworth shows very clearly just exactly how to install the little ejection port cover spring in a way that is infinitely more understandable than looking a pictures in a book. The are so many little tricks and tips, such as how to use a simple special tool to install the pivot pin spring and detent, eliminating the possibility of shooting the detent across the room.

All necessary special tools are shown and explained. I didn't realize there is a special flat punch made especially for installing/removing the bolt stop pin. Most of the necessary special tools are available on Amazon, none of which are particularly expensive.

Lenny Magil is, God love him, Lenny Magil. Hes been making gun videos for a long, long time. He is off camera, asking questions and making comments. Some of them are a little questionable, but so what. He made a great video.

Jim Van Middlesworth is phenomenal! I did not expect him to be so cool, calm, and professional. No umahum or awkward pauses. He KNOWS his business, and he did a fantastic job. Really. He did a great job.

This DVD is worth every penny. It has been a long time since I bought something that I thought was such a good value for the price.

If you get bitten by the AR-15 bug, and you are at all handy, do not fear building a complete rifle from scratch. This video is literally all you need.",1383868800,,2748,4.571138211382114

They make specific recommendations and give you tips that can make a big difference. For instance, do you know there is a difference between the diameter of mil-spec and commercial stock extension?

We were able to complete the rifle in about 3 hours with a few breaks.  We added a halographic dot sight and sighted it with a laser ""cartridge"" at 25 yards.

4511064,4,B004ZZDYDG,"Anyone considering building by themselves should watch this video first. It's a bargain for the price, because it might just save you time, money, and frustration. If you have a familiarity with tools or have gunsmithing experience, fine and dandy, build it yourself. But if this is something you've never done before, get help. It is very easy to screw this up, as the video makes clear, especially in the early stages when it is easy to damage the lower, sometimes beyond repair.

The video also shows that to do it right, you should invest in a number of speciality tools. The cost of these tools (punches, wrenches, receiver block, etc.) mounts up pretty quickly. If you live in the New York Tri-State area, you can spend roughly the same amount of money at Gun for Hire in Woodland Park, NJ, and they will work with you one-on-one to design, order parts, and guide you through the build, using all the right tools.",1371772800,,919,4.638036809815951

I would strongly recommend this DVD to anyone who owns an AR for the instruction value alone, regardless of your desire to build your own. As a side note.... prior to watching this DVD I had never fully disassembled my rifle.. after watching it the first time, I easily FULLY disassembled my rifle and was able to identify all the individual parts.

This DVD is not among them. There are no expensive special effects or extraneous props, just good, expertly taught instruction. Each part is identified and clearly shown, needed tools are presented with their uses, and commonly made errors which might result in expensive damage to gun or shooter are presented in well thought out instruction. The instructor is obviously a well experienced professional with years of experience who knows his subject and how to teach it to others in a clear and concise manner.

This video does provide all of the required information to fully build a rifle using parts kits and there are a lot of good tips and tricks to help you avoid common mistakes. I particularly like the active camera work that captures the detail of the finer build steps.

4511120,5,B004ZZDYDG,"I shot this video when I was working for J.D. Machine Tech in San Diego back about late 2009 or early 2010. When I say I shot it I mean I was the instructor and my boss said I was doing a video that day. The video was not scripted, the director, Lenny Magill, prompted me with questions and I ran with it from there.
At the time I was J.D.'s chief armorer having recently retired from the San Diego Sheriff's Office where I'd worked for 25 years as a deputy in various capacities; mainly patrol and as a firearms instructor and armorer for 10 years. I'm very gratified at the good reviews of both videos. It was important to me to make the subject as clear and interesting as possible and not try to pull over any BS on anyone. They were fun projects and I'd love to do more but I now live in South Carolina and I don't think Lenny will fly me back to shoot more videos. I'd go if he asked.",1355011200,77,890,4.0625

After my usual anal research, I purchased this video and a book ""The Competitive AR15 Builders Guide: How to Choose and Assemble All the Components to Construct Your Ultimate AR-15"".  There is scads of info on the web, but the price easily covers the time it would take to find and assemble what these resources cover.  They turned out to be a perfect match for my purposes.
""Building Your AR-15 From Scratch"" is a no nonsense guide to AR assembly (well, maybe a little nonsense of the dry humor type).  There is a lot of hype reeling around the web about calibers, components, addons, and on and on for AR's, and this presentation doesn't get caught up in it.  It does plug a couple of companies, but they are top of the line outfits - nothing wrong there as far as I was concerned.
The question and answer approach was very effective in this tutorial. Both the function and placement of each and every part were methodically explained.  Alternate assembly techniques are covered; tool and part selection for a basic gun are discussed in a manner that was easy for me to understand.  Also covered was how each part is ordered, if it is ordered separately, or comes with a certain kit of parts.
This video was very helpful for understanding how the parts work in the AR system, and enabled me to start ordering parts that would work/fit together.  I would recommend ""Building Your AR-15 From Scratch"" to any DIY'er thinking of building an AR, or to owners of AR's who want to understand how they work and troubleshoot problems.",1353974400,,1585,4.615658362989324

4511132,5,B004ZZDYDG,"My boys and I wanted to build our own AR-15 from scratch.  This video is exactly what we wanted.  We all know how to handle firearms but have never owned one of these.  This video is done in an interview format while the weapon is being assembled.  He gives many tips that will be helpful.  If you've never owned an AR-15 or are new to them, this video will save you a lot of time and answers about any question you may have.  It was like taking a course on AR-15 assembly.  We liked it!",1346284800,,487,4.063157894736842
4511133,5,B004ZZDYDG,"Excellent video! I have low mechanical aptitude so when I recently built my AR-15 I did it with the help of an AR-15 armorer. However, I bought this video and watched it 3 times before I did my build. I am really glad I did. I understood everything we did during the build and I was about to talk with the armorer intelligently thoughout the process.

All aspects of this video were excellent. The armorer in the video describes the parts, the tools, the why's and the wherefore's. The format is conversational, with an invisible host asking useful questions along the way. The videography is excellent. Close-up shots are in focus and well lit. Every step is shown in order and fully explained.

A couple of years ago I bought and read the book on building an AR-15 and came away frustrated that I was no better off after reading it than before. Not so with this video. It is three hours long with virtually no wasted time. It is laid out in order so that you can play a section of the video, do that part of the build, play the next section, build the next part, and so on. It gave me the confidence I needed to do my own build.

I plan on doing another build on my own in a couple of months using this video as my guide.

It is important to remember that an AR-15 generates very high pressures and has little tolerance for error. When I built mine the armorer had bought an upper which had already been properly gauged and headspaced and took it apart for me to put back together. When I build my next one I will buy a completed upper which has already been professionally gauged and headspaced. I want the zombie to die, not me. I will assemble the lower and the stock, but only modify the upper. I will leave the 60,000 psi stuff to the pros.

Great video. I highly recommend it. It will remain a part of my permanent library.",1344816000,13,1831,4.2956521739130435
4511134,5,B004ZZDYDG,"I had never owned a AR-15 before and this took off some of the noob factor.  The guy takes you throught the rifle in sections like upper, lower, barrel, etc. so it's easy to follow.  If you know a little bit already and just want to see a section like the lower to understand the trigger you can without having to fast forward.

Audio is good and while the video is in SD, it is more than good enough for this instructional video.

If you are a pro, you might pickup a few how to's that are not easy without practice like putting the trigger assymbly together from scratch.

Would buy this in other subject materials.",1344470400,7,617,4.2844827586206895
4511135,5,B004ZZDYDG,"I bought this as a refresher. I found it very informative, with alot of useful information. A novice could build an AR with this video and have no problems. I recommend it highly.",1343865600,,179,4.454545454545454
4511136,5,B004ZZDYDG,"This is my third video on the AR platform.  I like to get various perspectives from the different videos because everyone has a slightly different way of assembling these guns, or sometimes you get what I call ""golden nuggets"" of information from one video that another leaves out.

This video was very well done, I felt like the pace was good and the narrator doesn't ask too many ""dumb"" questions ;)

If you're thinking about building your own AR, I would recommend this video, and I'm recommending this as someone who has taken an AR-15 armorer's course.

Keep in mind that some of the assembly techniques shown are personal preferances, and there are usually two or more ways to do every operation, but all in all this is a very good video to own.",1341532800,,751,4.582089552238806
