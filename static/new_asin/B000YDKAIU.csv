8232058,3,B000YDKAIU,"""Junior G-Men of the Air"" was released by Universal in 1942 and stars The Dead End Kids and the Little Tough Guys with Lionel Atwill, Turhan Bey and others, directed by Ray Taylor and Lewis D. Collins.

The plot is little different than the first ""Junior G-Men"" serial, only the names have been changed, the nationality of the bad guys is identified, and Billy Halop's father has been promoted from a Colonel to the operator of a junk yard dealing in airplane parts.  A foreign country has spies right here in the U.S.A., and the the gang -- this time named Ace Holden, ""Bolts"" Larsen, ""Greaseball"" Plunkett and ""Stick"" Munsey (Billy Hallop, Huntz Hall, Gabriel Dell and Bernard Punsly) witness a bank robbery.  The robbers crash their car, and steal the boys' truck.  But Ace's gang doesn't trust ""the coppers"" and go after the crooks on thier own; it takes several chapters before there is cooperation with the authorities.  The Foreign Enemy Organization is headed by The Baron, who looks just like Lionel Atwill with some added hair.  They abduct Ace's brother, Eddie (Gene Reynolds) who has invented a muffler for airplane engines.  Eventually Ace is convinced the offered help is useful, and works with Junior G-Man Jerry Markham (34-year-old Frank Albertson) and the State Police to round up the evildoers.

This was a quickly-made propaganda serial, though there are the usual fist fights, explosions and antics of the Dead End Kids to keep up interest, if not watched all at once.  Lionel Atwill has my vote for least-convincing serial-movie Japanese bad guy; years ago when I first saw the serial I thought ""The Baron"" was supposed to be German until he stated otherwise in Chapter Six.  He still provides a touch of class, as does Turhan Bey as his henchman Araka.  A comparison with Republic's ""Spy Smasher"" of the same year may be a little unfair, but it shows how far behind Universal was in special effects and most other aspects of serial movie production.  Still, some of the model work isn't bad, such as the disguised hanger at the farm hideout, with a remote-controlled fence.  This being the kind of film it is, it has the usual anti-Japanese rhetoric, though fairly tame until the last chapter.  Understandable for the time, it serves as a reminder that a similar mix of racism and patriotism remians in use today when a ""foreign power"" is attacked by the media.

The VCI and Alpha DVD releases appear to be from the same film print, most chapters from a reissue copyright by Serials Incorporated, with redone titles spliced onto the chapters.  The splicing often messes up the start of the spoken introductions, which, in addition to a lot of ""patriotic"" talk, preview the action to come, and are followed by an acted-out recap of the previous chapter.  A couple of the introductions are for the wrong chapters.  The image is well-framed and the gray scale is adequate, but there are a number of scratches, a few splices and some dirt.  The sound isn't too bad, dialogue usually clear enough if frequency response is limited, but there is a recurrent buzz in the middle reel of the first chapter, and a lot of noise in Chapters Four and Twelve.  The ""next week"" titles were redone for a later release, apparently with different voice-over than the originals had, without any propaganda included.

VCI's transfer is the cleaner of the two, fairly sharp, though there are still some scratches and a little dirt present.  All of the opening titles are from the same chapter, even if the sound is not, though with one exception the only difference is the MPPDA certificate number.  VCI issued the serial on a single disc, and unfortunately the layer-switch point comes near the end of Chapter Six instead of between chapters, causing a momentary pause.  Some of the noise in the sound has been filtered out, not to the point of making the dialogue difficult to understand, but with further high-frequency loss.  Still, a good transfer if not an especially good print, and there is a wartime Daffy Duck cartoon included as an ""extra"" along with the original trailer and a ""Photo Gallery"" of still pictures.

The Alpha edition, number 9539D is a shrink-wrapped package of the two volumes, ALP 4209D and 4210D.  No ""extras"" are provided, except a catalog of some of their releases.  The transfer is from a videotape source and while not quite as sharp an image as VCI's, it isn't a lot worse, quite good for an Alpha release.  The chapter title ""cheat"" isn't done here -- each chapter appears to have the correct MPPDA certificate number, though they are quite hard to read, owing to poor contrast with the background image.  Of more interest, the main title for Chapter Four is from the original release, copyright by Universal Pictures Company, Inc., with motion in the background picture.  Alpha's sound has a bit more ""hiss"" generally, but not especially distracting and the dialogue slightly less muffled than VCI's edition.  The layout avoids the layer change that causes a glitch in VCI's Chapter Six.

Either of these editions is adequate, the main defect being the original print.  The Alpha release is cheaper, but not by a lot since it is on two discs, and it lacks the extra features provided by VCI.  Both provide the action, thrills and humor, intentional and otherwise, of this interesting but cheaply made serial.",1301875200,4,5345,4.829857299670691
