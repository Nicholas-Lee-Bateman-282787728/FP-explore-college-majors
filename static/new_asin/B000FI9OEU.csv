2566432,4,B000FI9OEU,"My 8-year-old daughter enjoys these, though they are a bit dated (as opposed to, say, Scooby Doo, which still seems fresh after all these years).

One problem: none of the DVDs played on my cheap portable DVD player.  They played fine on other players however, so we kept them.",1168300800,3,277,4.63265306122449
2566433,5,B000FI9OEU,"I was a huge Hong Kong Phooey fan when I was a kid so I was thrilled when the complete set came onto DVD. I have two kids, 5 & 8 and I was hoping they would love it too.  It was a hit with them and I enjoyed seeing the episodes through fresh eyes.  The episodes are just as effective today, the characters are great (Rosemary and the Chief still make me smile)the only difference now is I get some of the more subtle humor that as a kid I missed.  Poor Spot he never gets any credit!  The quality is great, and a value with all the episodes that are on this DVD. If you are a 70's fan, don't miss this one.",1167868800,,606,3.824
2566434,5,B000FI9OEU,"The release of ""Hong Kong Phooey"" The Complete Series on DVD is great family fun and pure nostalgia for any Hong Kong Phooey fan. Warner Studios has done a wonderful job with this DVD release. The Video transfer is definitely superior to any television version I can remember watching as a kid. The colors are sharp and vibrant and the sound is crystal clear. With its catchy theme song performed by Scatman Crothers, you'll be instantly hooked. Hong Kong Phooey still provides children with hours of harmless fun and it's still enjoyable after all these years. Hong Kong Phooey is a welcomed addition to any DVD collection and a must have for Hanna Barbera fans. The bonus features were a pleasant surprise and I found them very interesting. What's the delay? Here's you're chance to hop in the ""Phooeymobile"" and join Hong Kong Phooey and his striped side kick Spot as they try to rid the city of crime.

Pick up ""Hong Kong Phooey"" and join Penry, Sergeant Flint, Rosemary and Spot for a Karate chopping Good Time!!",1166227200,3,2112,5.469325153374233
2566435,5,B000FI9OEU,"Hong Kong Phooey returns to your TV screen in this latest release of classic animation from the renowned Hanna-Barbera studios.  Always on top of the day's pop culture, the studio released this series (originally called KUNG FOOEY) as HB's answer to the Seventies craze of martial arts movies, Bruce Lee, and the David Carradine series KUNG FU.

Voiced by the venerable Scatman Crothers (whose enjoyment of this character shines through in every performance), Hong Kong Phooey was the alter-ego of mild-mannered janitor Penrod ""Penry"" Pooch, who worked at the local police station with the loud-mouthed, stress-riddled Sergeant Flint (Joe E. Ross, another great character voice) and gorgeous, chatty telephone operator Rosemary (Kathy Gori).  When evil threatened, Penry sneaked away to a back room where he leaped into a file cabinet (and repeatedly got stuck) to become the champion crimefighter Hong Kong Phooey.  Armed with his loyal but long-suffering cat Spot (who was striped, and thought HKP was a dolt), his trusty but ultimately non-useful Hong Kong Book Of Kung Fu, and his transforming Phooeymobile, Phooey waged a courageous if bumbling one-man war on crime.

This was one of HB's strongest mid-Seventies shows, with an unforgettable theme song (that even included a scat part, courtesy of Crothers) and a wonderful, hilarious title character whose obliviousness to his own ineptitude and complete dumb luck made for some great cartoon television.  Part of Phooey's likability is due to the talented Crothers' characterization; his warm voice and good-natured delivery create a character who is sympathetic even at his most egotistical or boneheaded.  His supporting cast is also well-realized; Ross's Sergeant Flint captures the right foil for Phooey in his continuous attempts to gain a promotion and properly run a police station; Gori's Rosemary, head-over-heels in love with Phooey (but ignorant of his real identity), is a bright spot in the proceedings.  And of course, the hardworking Spot, who mutters and curses as he repeatedly saves Phooey from his own klutziness, is essential to the humor.

The packaging is well-done, with colorful slipcase artwork and a disc-container made to resemble Phooey's Hong Kong Book Of Kung Fu.  The discs themselves are one single and one double-sided with storyboards for one episode and a documentary on the creation and longevity of Hong Kong Phooey.

Pick this up for your cartoon collection and enjoy the exploits of the Number One Super Guy again, without commercials (or that annoying laugh track).  FAN-RIFFIC!!!",1159315200,11,2577,5.351485148514851
2566436,5,B000FI9OEU,"The picture quality in these transfers is OUTSTANDING!!!!!! There are some nice extras with interviews from people who worked on the show. Just a very nice set. Only thing I didn't like was the flipper disc, with a classic show like this I would have preferred 3 discs instead of 1 and a flipper , still this was well worth the money!!!!! A timeless classic to be enjoyed over and over. They did a great job with this DVD release!!!!! Can't say enough!!!!!",1155945600,27,456,4.506024096385542
2566437,5,B000FI9OEU,"This was a big suprise and totally awesome to see in the stores. A real trip down nostalgia lane.  One of my favorite cartoons from childhood now on DVD.  I would have never guess, although the theme song is unforgetable.  This is the entire collection of Cartoons, all 31 episodes.  Penrod, the loyal and dedicated janitor at the Sargent Flint's police station, Is secretly living a double life as Hong Kong Phooey, the number one Superguy, and his reputation is extrodinary.  Working in the police station give him a jump on solving crime. Rosemary, the dispatch operator, and Sargent Flint give him the heads up when trouble is brewing.  Hong Kong's Powers of observation and deduction are impecable, at least they are to him.  With a little luck, some Kung Phooey Kung Fu, and a helpful hand from  his stripeed cat Spot, He always gets his man.  Just an excellent item to see come out, something I hope to share some day with my kids.  Kudos to Hanna-Barbara. Now, if I could see Thundar The barbarian on DVD. Someday hopefully.  This is a must have Item, and it affordable too.",1155600000,3,1082,4.6421052631578945
2566438,4,B000FI9OEU,"Where were you at 9am on Saturday mornings in 1974/1975? If you were a kid in the 70's, you likely were watching ABC and the series Hong Kong Phooey.

Hong Kong's janitor alter-ego name is Penry, though a lot of folks thinks it's Henry.

To clarify, there are 30 10-minute episodes, and one 20-minute episode (Comedy Cowboy) plus a couple of minutes of beginning and ending credits. Normally, two episodes were shown each Saturday. Commercials filled in the remainder of the 1/2 hour.

The video quality is excellent and the documentaries are typical ""behind the scenes"" material.

The main reason to watch these shows today is for the nostalgia.  The animation and the episodes were mediocre at best.  But to a kid, they were golden. I'm hoping my kids will enjoy them.

A must-have for 70's collectors!",1155600000,9,804,4.824817518248175
2566439,5,B000FI9OEU,"For many of us, Hong Kong Phooey was the last great Hanna-Barbera cartoon character when it debuted in the fall of 1974. He was a Kung Fu crime fighting dog who never could quite go off the book. He was helped by a stripped cat named Spot. He was voiced by the immortal Scatman Crothers. The great Joe E Ross played Sgt. Flint.

Now don't get confused with the claim of 31 episodes. There were only 16 half hour long episodes. Each ""episode"" listed below was half the show except for the final ""Cowboy"" adventure that was the full 30 minutes. It'll be great to have the complete collection on the shelf in time for the 32 anniversary of Hong Kong Phooey.

The episodes will be presented in Full Frame (1.33:1) video, with an English mono audio track (with subtitles in English, French and Spanish). Here's a look at the episodes:

Finally As the guy that made these cartoons says on the commentary on disc 2 side b there were only 16 episodes with 2 parts.  This set claims 31 episodes which means one half of one episode is entirely missing..  Not to mention the heavy editing probably for PC reasons.

This show is different because it was original. It is funny and a great parody with super/Kung fu movies. I remember it as a kid and I still find it funny nowadays.

2566519,3,B000FI9OEU,"OK, the reason why this set has three stars is that these episodes are edited! Yes these are NOT complete episodes, they are incomplete.

To try and fit them onto the disc (I assume) Warner Bros. used Syndicated masters and NOT the original Saturday Morning versions. Me and a friend of mine saw the episodes on the UK set and I got this to clarify that they are the same episodes and we both agree that scenes are clearly missing. Perhaps, Warner Bros. at the time only had access to the syndicated masters (which were edited to give more time to commercials and local TV network continuity) and didn't have direct access to the Saturday Morning masters, still it is a pity.

Other then that, the packaging is very nice and it does include some extras on the second (double sided) disc, which is more then what the UK got, though the second disc was not double sided, which explains the lack of extras, that this set has.

The only hope we have of getting the unedited episodes is very likely an MOD (manufacture on demand) release, but Warner Bros. and the public needs to know first that these episodes are incomplete. Hopefully the ball will be set into motion to find the Saturday Morning masters and have them released in an unedited set on DVD.",1445990400,9,1251,4.5265486725663715

2566631,5,B000FI9OEU,"Hong Kong phooey is one of those shows that should have had more episodes made... I thought that the cartoon was a light hearted poke at the Kung Fu era.. Scatman really brings Hong Kong to life and really makes you this think the character exists.. Penrod would get his cases when Rosemary or the Sarg would talk about the latest crime.. As Hong Kong Phooey, he is not too sure footed. He solves cases by accident or with the help of spot...

This show is a lot of fun and has some great Behind the scenes stuff on the show and even some commentary from the people who made the show... Too bad there wasn't any interview footage from some of the voice cast...

Even though the cartoon is not up to what kids expect today, the water color backgrounds give it that classic look...

Favorite episodes

Car Thieves
 Zoo Story
Professor Crosshatch
The Claw
Hong Kong Phooey Vs Hong Kong Phooey (Could have had the double in the same color robe)
Batty Bank Mob
Stop horsing Around
The Great Movie Mystery (Richard Dawson as Eric Von Eric)

Most times he depends on his Hong Kong Book of Kung Fu to figure out how to get out of a jam.. It often messes him up or has something funny happen.. Got to love the magic Phooeymobile! Could turn into anything ""Ice Cream float and a fishing float.""

He is a hero that has the skills but does not quite know how to use them right... Smiles all around.. :-)",1317686400,,1391,4.326923076923077

2566651,4,B000FI9OEU,"I've waited for years for this.  I remember being a little kid waking up on Saturday mornings eagerly anticipating the exploits of Hong Kong Phooey and his sidekick Spot.  As with many things, however, anticipation is often the best part.  Looking at this with the eyes of a thirty-something, the plot lines, acting, and animation just can't match my memories.  That was not unexepected.  The show is what it is.  If you want a deep thought-provoking cartoon series with greater depth, humor, and quality, buy Rocky and Bullwinkle.  If you just want to relive part of your childhood, the grab a bowl of Fruity Pebbles, put on your flannel pajamas, and drop in this DVD.  Seeing my kids enjoy this cartoon as much as I did makes me realize that the magic of Saturday morning cartoons had little to do with the cartoons themselves, and much more to do with the imagination and innocence of being a child--combined with the sugar rush from the Fruity Pebbles...",1188172800,9,958,4.728915662650603
2566652,5,B000FI9OEU,"By 1974, even Hanna Barbera themselves admitted that the quality of stheir shows had gone downhill largely due to pressure from politically correct Children's TV watchdogs who wanted to sissify the cartoons into the sickeningly sweet New Zoo revue types, but I digress.

HKP was one of the last of the cartoon duo's classics.

First of all, the show was quite imaginative. A Kung Fu fighting dog janitor named Penrod Pooch in a police station who yearns to be a super hero, and his cat friend and sidekick who willingly puts up with his foolishness and resues him every time. Our man (OOPS! I mean dog) frequently refers to his ""Hong Kong Book of Kung Fu"" filled with bad advice that never works. If that's not creativity, tell me what is?

Secondly, brilliant voice talent. The great Scatman Crothers (who we kids of the time also knew as Louie the Garbage Man from Chico & the Man) was unbeatable as the title character. Joe E. Ross as the police sergeant and Rosemary the ""Cuty whose always on the duty"" added lively spark to the series.

Finally, it's just plain FUNNY! The humor is character based as opposed to bad puns. The sissy cowboy in the next to the last episode scolds his wild outlaw brothers for ""messing up my crescent rolls.""

Oh what a HOOT! Trust me, you and your kids will really enjoy this and this is one of those childhood pleasures that will not disappoint your memories when seeing it as an adult.",1183939200,23,1423,4.564705882352941
