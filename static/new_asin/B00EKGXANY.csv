5925784,5,B00EKGXANY,"I have been nothing but impressed by the Mobile Suit Gundam Unicorn series and the 3rd part continues to meet my expectations for a quality Gundam series. I have loved the animation, the soundtrack (which I listen to frequently), and the story. Both episodes in this DVD have me ready for the final episode! I have watched part 3 multiple times and it never gets old. It's a great addition to the Universal Century Timelime in the Gundam world.",1404950400,,444,4.632911392405063

5925786,5,B00EKGXANY,"Great anime series. Must have for your collection. Very economic for your budget. Wanting more, if they release the last episode.",1394582400,2,129,5.190476190476191
5925787,5,B00EKGXANY,"Great entry in the series, and while there's not a whole lot of action as in the others I thought the story ran fairly deep with a few character moments.",1393891200,,153,4.133333333333334
5925788,5,B00EKGXANY,"Really good show, action, story, high quality animation. Seeing previous gundam series definitely helps though especially universal century timeline. Still waiting for the last episode.",1393027200,2,185,6.44
5925789,5,B00EKGXANY,My son truly enjoyed this! He said it was very interesting and more than worth purchasing it !! Into Gundam? Get it !!,1388966400,3,118,4.173913043478261
5925790,4,B00EKGXANY,"A huuuge THANK YOU goes out to Rightstuf for publishing this third DVD, otherwise we would have lost Unicorn thanks to Bandai going under. Then we would have had to buy those really expensive Blu-rays... Anyway, the DVD quality is very good, and the reversible cover is also fantastic! It's a great touch you never see nowadays. Episodes 5 and 6 are actually pretty decent, 5 being overall better than 6. The mecha porn is glorious, as expected of Sunrise. My complains are that they used a little too much CG in episode 6, Banagher being a super lame and uninspired protagonist as usual, and the little plot twist at the end of 6... come on, really? Oh well, still it's kinda a must-buy for any UC Gundam fan.",1385510400,,710,4.511627906976744
5925791,5,B00EKGXANY,"This dvd is simply amazing. It contains episodes 5 and 6 of Gundam Unicorn. I am not going to get into the episodes but the production value of the dvd is simply beautiful. It holds true to the previous two volumes of Gundam Unicorn and has the same menus and bonus features, which are a joy to own. The dvd also includes a reversible cover like the previous volumes and other various Gundam dvd series. If you own the previous two volumes of Gundam Unicorn this is a must have to get closer to completing your collection. It includes the English and the Japanese audio tracks with subtitles. I am very happy that Gundam Unicorn has been picked backed up for production on dvd here in the USA.",1383955200,,693,4.421875
8606328,5,B00EKGXANY,I bought this for my husband for Christmas and he was so excited because he didn't think that you could ever get the Unicorn series in the US. Plus they are all a decent price. Thank you Amazon!,1517529600,,194,4.131578947368421

8606331,5,B00EKGXANY,"With Bandai no more, fans were worried that the Gundam Unicorn DVD releases would come to a halt. However, RightStuf stepped in and not only released the third set, but maintained the design to match the others as well! And it sure beats the Bluray prices! Covering episode 5: The Black Unicorn and episode 6: Two Worlds, Two Tomorrows, these episodes are more space-driven and look like fantastic theatrical Gundam releases like they should.

Another single disc release and a reversible cover again! Thanks RightStuf!",1464825600,,519,5.105882352941176

8606333,3,B00EKGXANY,"This review is written for all 4 volumes of Gundam UC, since I ordered them all together. I've been meaning to get the series since last year with the final release, but wasn't going to pay almost $200. I got them on DVD as well to fit the rest of the collection (all of which are DVD as well).

I absolutely LOVE Mobile Suit Gundam UC. It's one of the best two Universal Century series out of them all, with the other being 0083 Stardust Memory. The animation & soundtrack are well beyond expectation, I only wish they would redo the other UC era series with the current-age tech to give them the same level of graphical beauty as Gundam Unicorn (Not to mention it would FINALLY give ZZ Gundam & Victory Gundam a dubbed release).

HOWEVER, the reason that I rated them at only 3 Stars out of 5...

2 Day Shipping.

When I get 2 DAY shipping, I expect the order to arrive 2 days later, not 4 days Amazon...

My order was placed on Saturday, July 18th with a GUARANTEED arrival of Monday, July 20th. Yet, when I access the tracking later on it says that the guaranteed arrival is now Wednesday, July 22nd. My question; Why?

Overall, I'm well beyond satisfied with the product. It's just the delay in shipping that bugs me a bit. However it's the first issue I've had with Amazon, so I'll let it slide.",1437523200,,1301,4.333333333333333
8606334,5,B00EKGXANY,"Im Gundam bias and this is an excellent series. I never read the manga, so don't know what was left or in or true to its but its definitely worth checking out. This will be excellent to your existing Gundam and anime collection.",1423526400,,228,4.325581395348837
