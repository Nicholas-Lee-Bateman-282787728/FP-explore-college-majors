Well, at least until someone plants a virus into the system before he dies and all of the sudden labors are on the rampage, and it would take more than Pinkerton's Men to stop these guys. If you are looking for a fast-paced in your face action with a hyper cool robot title, look no further... for another anime. But, if you a are looking for an anime that poses deep questions such as ""Who am I really?"", ""My purpose is?"", ""Will the Cubs ever win a World Series?, and...aw nevermind, it's not like that either. All I can say is that Patlabor is a smart, and stylized mecha movie with enough techno stuff and mystery to boot. But of course, the Patlabor series is one of the best mecha anime series ever, so what's not to expect? Especially at the hands of director Mamoru Oshii (Ghost in the Shell). The big difference about Patlabor is that instead of focusing on the mecha, it focuses on the people. Labors aren't the solve-all, end-all super robots out to save the world, they're functional machines, and could be related to much like cars today. That's where Patlabor works its magic, with the characters. Masami Yuki, one of the creators of Patlabor, and Headgear, took what was originally a parody of Gundam into an anime that has come into a light of its own. Patlabor is great show and a great movie, and Patlabor 2, even beter that the first, is considered Oshii's masterpiece. Highly recomended to dedicted fans and the casual otaku alike, Oshii show us that technology does not always mean progress, and nothing is ever failsafe.",978652800,5,1574,4.604982206405694
7849276,5,6303525164,"Much along the lines of Ghost and Mononoke, this one has a great backdrop, and more twists and turns, with some comic relief, and a few moody parts broken in.
The Patlabor designs were excellent, and the references to History understate the need for more films like this on this side of the Pacific.",972259200,,299,4.555555555555555
7849277,5,6303525164,"This film has one of the most smart and well written mystery cop stories I've seen.  When I first watched this, I had no idea who the characters were but I quickly catched on to them after watching the second time.  The music soundtrack is excellent and the characters are well developed.  My favorite line is (Asuma looking at Noa: SHUT UP AND EAT YOUR PIZZA!) lol!
Oh Yeah...For those of you who watched both movies...I'm sure they're making a third installment but its not by Headgear so let's hope it meets the quality and standards of the first two movies!
If anyone knows more about the third movie..e-mail me @ isaac.tan@home.com",971395200,,636,4.660714285714286
7849278,5,6303525164,"I watched this film expecting another generic anime about crazy giant  robots, big guns, even bigger explosions and not a lot else. What I, in  fact got took me a little by surprise. The action is there, and executed  incredibly well, with crisp, detailed animation and believeable machines.  Lurking behind this, however I found Patlabour to be a dark, phychological  and clever thriller. It traces the path of the villians decent into  insanity with remarkable feeling and compassion. The soundtrack adds to  this atmosphere with soft, orchastral strains. One of my favourite films,  bar, well, not many. Recommended.",968889600,,619,5.244897959183674
7849279,5,6303525164,"Uno de los mejores animes que se pueden ver. Mamoru Oshii es un director que sorprende con cada trabajo. Patlabor es un thriller futurista, una trama terrorista y policial, llena de suspense y acci&oacute;n. Aderezada con unos  gr&aacute;ficos soberbios, una m&uacute;sica sensacional y una ambientaci&oacute;n muy realista,  supera con creces a la segunda parte. Los fans del anime no quedar&ntilde;an  decepcionados.",960076800,2,418,5.819672131147541
7849280,5,6303525164,"I got interested into Mamoru Oshii's work after I saw the stunning ""Ghost in the shell"" and I have to say that I wasn't disappointed by this earlier release. It's an ambitious movie, that tries to renew the  typical mecha-action story, and succeeds thanks to a multi-layered ,  complex plot that blends seamlessly science-fiction and detective story,  very realistic in its premises (the mechas are very much everyday tools)  but also with many interesting twists (the investigation scenes in the  slums of Tokyo have an intriguingly surreal quality to them) True, it's not  a relentless, action-packed movie, but I think that the battle scenes (the  one in the streets of Tokyo is splendid!)have a stronger impact on the  viewer when they make sense in the context of a story, and this is the  case. The final climax, maybe, is not as powerful as I expected, but that's  a minor flaw, because the rest is so good. Also , this is a movie, not a  tv-series, so it has the kind of top-notch quality usually reserved to  theatrical releases: superior character design, wonderfully  ""fluid"" animation,  and incredibly detailed machines, mechas,  landscapes etc. The sequel is supposed to be even better, and I'll get it  for sure. Strongly recommended.",956793600,10,1248,4.956521739130435
