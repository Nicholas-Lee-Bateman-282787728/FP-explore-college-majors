8427137,5,B004EKZTKI,"This box set is a great look at the pacific war and told bye men who were there,It is well narrated and the graphics are well done as are the reenactments. I wish they would release the rest of the series on Europe in one box set as well. I would recommend this to anyone interested in world war 2 documentaries as told bye the soldiers who experienced it first hand and i consider it a must have. My only complaint is that they left out the battle of Peleliu as it was one of the best in the series and for some reason always seems to gets left out.",1312243200,3,550,4.009090909090909
