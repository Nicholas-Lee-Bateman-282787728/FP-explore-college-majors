8088983,1,B000BMCY0G,"I was very disappointed. Equipment technique you have to own what she is showing you.
And that poor woman that was her model had to lay there as she is rambling on and on.
She should have started the video out by explaining the equipment she owns going through each equipment step and what not to do with the client.
Then doing the facial with the client.
Im glad I didn't purchase anymore.",1514073600,,390,4.3561643835616435

8088985,5,B000BMCY0G,"This was a great purchase.  The DVD is very informative and has helped me brush up on my skills since I passed my state boards.  It's been very helpful watching this video and taking notes.  Everyone needs a refresher on knowledge we already know.  This DVD definitely helped with that.  I think this DVD was worth every penny.  I highly recommend it to any skin specialist, especially estheticians.  It was packaged well, shipped quickly, and in new condition.  This is a quality seller.  A great refresher for those of us that haven't made it into the business yet but have the credentials.",1469491200,,592,4.7254901960784315
8088986,5,B000BMCY0G,As an aesthetician I found this Dvd very informative and educational. The instructor is clear and concise in her demonstration of how to perform a complete facial. She shows us many facial techniques with the use of a facial machine which has 8 different functions. Rita's knowledge is extensive and I recommend this Dvd to anyone who wants to offer facial massage as a treatment.,1415232000,,380,4.861538461538461

8088989,5,B000BMCY0G,"I'm an Esthetics Instructor who have used this video to add to my class lessons.  It's a good way for students to see how others use the equipment, and then demonstrate to them as well live in class. I wished it included microcurrent use but I'm sure that they have a video for that too. I highly recommend this for anyone who are also looking to purchase  the equipments listed here to see if it's a good fit for their clients.",1401235200,,428,4.271604938271605
