209638,5,6300147487,"I had wanted to see this movie for years, after only knowing the parody SCTV did in the early 80s (""The Nobel"")...It exceeded all my expectations; I would say SCTV's version only exaggerated the film by about 10 percent! The real reason to watch is Tony Bennett as the jewish-Irishman Hymie Kelly (do you think we'd get it, with a name like that?):his performance is the opposite of his singing range, a 1-note, over-the-top set-devouring scream! The 'climactic' scene where he beats up Steven Boyd with a wastepaper basket must be seen to be believed!
 I really love this film, though, because it represents the final moments of classic Hollywood, before the poisonous influence of late-60s ""youth culture""(beginning with BONNIE AND CLYDE) lead American movies down the path of tedious ""naturalism"" and nihilistic antiheroes...give me the ""phony"" world of THE OSCAR any day!",1215907200,13,875,5.118881118881119
209639,3,6300147487,Who doesn't love the Oscars altho this movie is watchable for all the stars it doesn't get any better then watching the 2008 Oscar presentations. Half hour after its over you forgot who was nominated and who won. Watchable just to see all the stars and how bad they can all be together in one movie.,1211068800,6,299,4.357142857142857
209640,4,6300147487,"Combine bad acting, a script with so many cliche lines it's laughable and a storyline that's so predictable that it makes soap operas look serious, and you have one of the greatest bad movies ever made: ""The Oscar."" This film is so outrageous that it easily crosses that so-awful-it's-tremendous line. Stephen Boyd is so caricaturish as Frankie Fane that he's hilarious. Tony Bennett may have left his heart in San Francisco, but he has no idea where he left his acting ability. Elke Sommer, Jill St. John and Eleanor Parker may form the worst trio of headlining actresses in the history of Hollywood. Ernest Borgnine is a sure sign that the cast is comedic, especially when legendary comedian Milton Berle is ludicrously cast in a dramatic role. I'm not even going to get into Jack Soo as the houseboy. All I can say is that if you can get a rare copy of this cult classic -- which for integrity purposes never seems to find its way on television -- grab it and enjoy. Bad never felt so good.",1174176000,20,993,4.553072625698324

7803224,3,6300147487,"It's a shame. Not even Eleanor Parker could save this silly film. I can't quite pin-point it, the big names were there, but for the most part were very shallow. Elke was, well, Elke and so was Ernest Borgnine--adequate performances. Stephen Boyd couldn't seem to make his character very interesting except coming out looking like a louse.  As said, only Eleanor Parker, and Milton Berle with a surprising strong performance, made this worth it for me.  Save yourself the money and download a full copy from YouTube. I did.",1465948800,,522,4.853932584269663

7803226,5,6300147487,Tony Bennett did a nice job of acting in this movie.,1419897600,,52,3.8181818181818183
7803227,3,6300147487,"I understand that the acting has been criticized in this movie, but I have to blame most of the issues on the script. Not to mention the direction. It is full of base clichs, vanity and some counter intuitive character roles. I think Stephen Boyd was a pretty good actor, but his character is pretty one dimensional. He is much better when he plays a role with less vocalizations. In this movie he overacts to parody. Tony Bennett, skewered by critics, overplays as well. Some character nuances would have helped. Ironically, the studio head [Joseph Cotten] is portrayed as near decent. Milton Berle, also a near good guy role, as his agent, is completely straight in his portrayal. There are too many cameos and it sprawls. Some sections should have been edited out or rewritten. In the end it collapses on itself and there is no sympathy left for anyone. Pettiness reigns. Still liked it for some Old Hollywood meets New Hollywood. Guilty pleasure for watching a mini train wreck.",1372291200,,982,4.7823529411764705
7803228,5,6300147487,The Oscar is a trashy Hollywood type film. I love  it ! Features Nancy Sinatra in an early cameo role.  Eleanor Parker gives a great  performance as Stephen Boyd's dumped lover. I enjoy the scene when she screams at him ! Many stars appear in this one and it is a doozy. Up there almost with Valley Of The Dolls.,1354665600,5,312,4.166666666666667
7803229,5,6300147487,"The Oscar - is a picture that is all too ignored.  In 1966, Stephen Boyd, Elke Sommer, Milton Berle, Eleanor Parker and many other top-notch stars made this film about an ambitcious young actor determined to make ""good"" in Hollywood.  He stops at nothing to achive his goal, and is eventually nominated for an Oscar.  Stephen Boyd's performance should have won him an oscar.  He creates a character you hate but cannot take your eyes off of.  There is intrigue, lies, murder and other untasteful things which keep the movie moving along.  The end is a shocker.  Bettcha you can't figure it out.",1352937600,5,594,4.70873786407767

7803231,1,6300147487,"I had the distinct pleasure of watching this dog of a film for an entire week in the 1960s, when I worked as an usher at the RKO Kenmore, an old movie palace that had been a vaudeville theatre in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn (now long gone). It is difficult to describe the awfulness of this film, and that includes the writing, the direction and above all, the acting. This phoney/chic story of a would-be Hollywood star who tried to ""buy"" an Oscar would probably be the least likely Oscar nominee in history. It was so bad that it was one of the earliest films to open without pre-press reviews (it opened on a Friday, in the hopes that no one would read the Saturday papers), but to no avail. The public, as they say, stayed away in droves. The lowest among many low points (this film put the nail in the coffin of Stephen Boyd's film career) is the climactic ""monologue"" of pop singer Tony Bennett in his first (and last) film role as Hymie Kelly (don't ask), the anti-hero's best friend.

This film is not available on DVD; be glad.",1294272000,5,1041,4.393782383419689
