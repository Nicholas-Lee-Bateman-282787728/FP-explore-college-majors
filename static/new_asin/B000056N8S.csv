7932588,5,B000056N8S,"It's very magnificent! When this movie came out, I was in 6th grade at that time when I was still getting involved with
hip hop after the tragic deaths of 2Pac and Notorious B.I.G. (also Eazy-E died in 1995 before Pac and Big). This movie
is about hip hop to the fullest!!!! Wu-Tang, Nas, Master P, The Fugees, everybody in that movie was telling their own
words about how hip hop started and telling their own experience in the streets before they took the world by storm when
they put out all hip hop classics in the '90s and telling it like it is. Every hip hop fan has to buy and own this.",1407110400,,593,4.2105263157894735
