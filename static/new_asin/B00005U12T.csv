1662751,4,B00005U12T,"three months ago i saw this at the roxie and after the film, i randomly asked a couple of people what they thought of it...one told me he flat out hated it. found it disturbing. a woman told me she thought it was groundbreaking. the two leads in the film nadine and mann ( karen bach and raffaela anderson ) go on a wild crime spree after mann kills her brother when he wants to know who raped her instead of showing his concern for her. subtlety and discretion are thrown out the window and they basically rob and kill anyone in their path. and yes, there is a lot of sex and it's all real. mann and nadie have complete control over their sexuality. in one scene nadine and mann are being raped. mann  passively shuts herself down to her attacker rendering herself as as little more than a recepticle, which is what she values her vagina. nadine is amazed by mann's passiveness at such a violent act. there is also one scene that may remind some of deliverance, but i'm not gonna tell you, you'll just have to see it. you will either love this movie or hate it...",995846400,11,1064,4.293532338308458

It is a film for thinking adults. Period. It will grab you by the throat and not let go.

Incidentally, don't think the 5 stars is because I just loved this movie, don't get me wrong. It is TOUGH to watch.

1662755,3,B00005U12T,"The film's title does not, translated directly, mean ""Rape Me"", but ""... Me"", and the two protagonists do plenty of that in between bouts of violence that probably got this film banned in its country of origin (the French are less tolerant of cinematic bloodshed than of sex).This violence includes an upsetting rape scene, shocking rather than educative as to that horrible crime, which might be what motivates one of the victims' teaming with a prostitute (Catherine Bach)to indulge in casual sex and violence, done with a vulgar amorality which works if only because their portrayals, and situations, seem caricaturish. ""Baise-moi"" is filmed in grainy, uncomplimentary colours, showing a France different from the one seen by tourists and even viewers of French cinema.

1662756,3,B00005U12T,the above question was taken from a review of 'rape me' (or the french title 'base moi').  my answer to that question is that it's neither.  'base moi' is low budget exploitation cinema.  there are attempts at the start of the film to portray a gender based message but that is quickly abandoned for fairly explicit sex and amoral violence.  if you're a fan of films that are more shocking that stylish or innovative i'd definitely recommend this film.  if you enjoy alternative cinema go see it but if the most shocking film you've ever seen is 'reservoir dogs' i'd say stick with tomb raider.,993427200,10,594,4.619047619047619

1662786,1,B00005U12T,I was looking forward to seeing this movie with all the hype just like everyone else but it was not good at all. I tried to think of a reason as to why I'm not sorry for getting it and all I come up with is that now I don't have to wonder about it anymore. I usually keep every controversial type movie so to watch it later. Not this one. It can't even go on my shelf next to my other classics. It is boring and hard to watch because of the bad acting & terrible camera work. It looks like it was filmed on a home camera. I didn't like the plot and was not pleased with the ending. Now that I've seen it I want to let others know about it. On the import version I received I didn't like the blurred out body parts since I understand what the movie is about and I don't like when companies do that. It takes away from the impact of the moment and ticks me off. I waited a long time until I found this movie at an affordable price and still feel I overpaid for it now. I was thinking of purchasing two other french movies with a lot of controversy but now i think I'll pass when I start to read into the negative feedback reviews more to figure out what those reviewers have watched in their past to see if I watch what they watch and have a similar outlook. I have to do more background investigation to see if I want to spend my money on the talked about movie. I wish I did on this one. Sometimes one has to see for themselves. Just stinks when it costs you money you could have used on a good movie instead. Good luck with your choice.,1373587200,,1537,3.9612903225806453

1662815,5,B00005U12T,"At the beginning of the novel Baise-Moi, and its movie shows violence by men to the women. It is shocking for most of the readers of the book or viewers of the film. On the other half to the end are like Sam Peckinpah actions by two actresses, like anime sequences. One is taller than the other, Karen Bach, her deep cool voice with peculiar manner of speaking are unforgettable. I believe some viewers might have been eager to learn how to speak French like her.

Although, the film was banned in France, both of Karen Bach and Raffaela Anderson's fanatic acting are fantastic. The story of their road travel in south France begins when Nadine (Karen Bach) and Manu (Raffaela Andersin) met at railroad station because they missed the last train. Manu offered to Nadine her mother's car if she can drive to Paris.

On the way to Biarritz, they found that they have common feeling against society. It's ""Anger"". Their violence on the travel gradually destroy their life. When they arrived Nancy near Toul, Manu was killed. Nadine wraps her body with blanket, gently kisses her and burns Manu's body in a forest. She cried and ready to stay with Manu by trigger her handgun to her head. The novel was written by Virginie Despentes in 1999.

To think about this best seller novel in France, the real violence is not in the book but out there. It is in our real world. It is like both of heaven and hell are in our real world. Song of ""Ouvre-Moi"" is about wishing for peace, and sadness against violence such as the solder that won't create the war has to go and their mother cries secretly.

January 28, Friday mid-night in 2005, the actress Karen Bach , leaving a farewell note to her mother, ""Too painful"" and committed suicide in Paris. She was 32.",1310947200,7,1748,4.5396825396825395
1662816,4,B00005U12T,Baise Moi is the tell of two girls with messed up lives who just so happen to cross paths. It stars 2 french adult-film stars and is also co-directed by an adult film director. The sex scenes are graphic and real but don't last that long. The violence is cheesy and fun. I would recommend this to anyone who can handle this kind of stuff.,1296864000,2,338,4.2153846153846155
1662817,4,B00005U12T,"They say that Thelma and Louise was based on this movie, but without the sex and violence. So, if you want a burst of European sex and violence, this is one to watch. However, the underlying premise is a serious one. Two women are at their lowest ebb, with no apparent prospects for anything. They meet, agree to drive across France and create various events of their own choosing; robbery, sex, violence and murder. The journey's end is almost predictable. For me, the interesting dimension is to imagine two males as the protagonists (and the viewing public's reaction) compared with the two women in the film (and the too often, contrasting reactions!). If you have a sensitive disposition concerning the depiction of sometimes violent sex and other related matters, do not watch this tale. If not, then watch it and `think about it'.",1283904000,,837,4.86013986013986
1662818,5,B00005U12T,"This is the film you extreme gorehounds have waited your entire life to see.  Baise Moi hits like a sledgehammer to the temporal lobe.  With lots of real sex scenes and a torrent of graphic violence, it flips the switch between rage and apathy while haphazardly soiling the screen with blood, sweat, tears, and other bodily fluids.  It will yank you within the battered psyche of the protagonists with its mind-numbing brutality and force you to not only somewhat identify with their harsh reality, but also empathize with nearly every victim.

Nadine (Karen Lancaume) and Manu (Raffala Anderson) are two friends that get pushed past their breaking point.  After being raped, the two ladies go on the most vicious killing spree you will ever witness.

This movie does have real sex scenes, but it is hardly an erotic film.  These pornographic scenes are always very brief, and they give the story an uncomfortable realism.  Add the gritty camera work and the senseless out-of-control violence, and you've summed up this brilliant hardcore movie.  Imagine an X-rated MONSTER or NATURAL BORN KILLERS.  Baise Moi is a no-holds-barred revenge flick ready to violate any and all expectations.",1282176000,3,1187,5.072164948453608
1662839,1,B00005U12T,"The filmmakers, of course, defend this movie as not pornography as it's not supposed to be erotic.  Yet during an early rape scene, the camera focuses on a shot exactly like you'd see in a porn film.  Why?  Was that necessary?  But the again, these filmmakers didn't seem to be all that interested in making a film but just an unpleasant journey for the viewer and they succeeded.

This film is no French ""Thelma and Louise.""  The latter film features one act of violence done in the heat of the moment.  This film features premeditated violence, most of if pointless and sensationalistic.  There's nothing noteworthy about this movie, not the performances or the cheap filming style.

Amateurishly directed, badly acted, metaphorically obvious (a woman is being sexually penetrated and she looks up to see an image of a gun on the television...how subtle!).  A movie with an obvious political agenda...all men are scumbags and perverts, therefore it is alright for angry women to commit acts of rape and murder.  The film strains so hard to be shocking and disturbing, but the only disturbing thing about it is that gullible people will be fooled into thinking it's a work of art.

I can't stand movies that treat gender issues so simplistically.  To reduce the complexity of human relations to a cut-and-dried,
black-and-white worldview as this film does is truly criminal.  Movies like this are harmful to your health.

There is nothing ""pretty"" about this film. It is about people at the very bottom of the social ladder, who live only to fulfill their own self indulgences by whatever means  they can.

Manu (Raffaela Anderson) is a porn actress, who along with a friend get graphically raped. When her overbearing brother finds out he grabs his gun to go and get justice, meanwhile she see's another friend in trouble and goes to help. Her brother goes and iterferes again and brings her back into his bar, an argument ensues and she murders him.

Nadine (Karen Lancaume) is a hooker who is addicted to porn, she is sharing her apartment with a woman who doesnt like Nadine's best freind. When Nadine returns home after performing a trick of the trade, so to speak, she gets into a fight with her roomie who again is running her freind down, the roomie gets killed.

Manu and Nadine meet by chance at a railway station, the trains have stopped running, they leave together and take off in a car supplied by Manu. From this point on it's murder, robbery and lust that rule their lives. This is a buddy movie with lots of sex and violence. Thelma and Louise eat your hearts out.",1188345600,,1167,4.521327014218009

1662880,1,B00005U12T,"Found this sad little DVD in the 2-99 bargain bucket and thought I'd give it a go.

What a mistake!

Baise-Moi is a blatent rip-off of Alain Tanner's far superior ""Messidor"" but with a shed-load of gratuitous and explicit sex and violence tacked on.

With two very unattractive women doing very unpleasant things to other unattractive people, this is utterly worthless and derivative art-house porn with nothing to redeem it.

1662883,4,B00005U12T,"Last years tragic suicide of actress Karen Bach at the age of 31 served as, perhaps, an inevitable endgame to the media shadowplay that rendered Biase Moi one of the most powerful and controversial films ever made.

Outraging international audiences with its release in June 2000 Baise Moi did that rare thing which musicians and artists once seemed to do on a regular basis, that is, become a social issue and push the parameters of the status quo to boiling point. Elvis did it and was seen as a communist plot, Breton did it and was accused of anarchy and Stravinsky's Rite of Spring had 1913 Parisians rioting in the streets. But now that the entertainment industry has finally perfected the art of all-out homogenisation; creative endeavour, with very few exceptions, continues to flounder behind the zeitgeist. Baise Moi seized it and buried it in its own blood.

Based on the novel by ex-prostitute Virginie Despentes, who co-directed the film with Coralie Trinh Thi, Baise Moi tells the story of two young women runaways who race each other to oblivion and mean to take anyone who gets in their face with them. The two leads are played convincingly by ex porn stars Raffaella Anderson and the aforementioned Karen Bach. If you can imagine Thelma and Louise on a PCP comedown, you're nearly on the money. This is essential viewing but bare in mind that few profound experiences are happy ones and watching Baise Moi is a perfect example of what this means. This is real and unashamed punk cinema, and to see it on the shelves of Sam Goodies in the `3 for $20' bin must have definitely given a fair few casual punters a bit a jolt once they'd settled in with a bottle of Merlot for a Sunday evening viewing. Believe - as far as commercially available films go - this should carry a government health warning. It barely helps that this is a female led production and thus avoids the cheap and easy `female exploitation' charges as it graphically depicts those staples of the cinematic experience, sex and violence, at a level rarely seen in mainstream cinema.

Baise Moi is the result of a specifically female rage and although Karen Bach's sad exit was not a direct result of having made this film, the road she walked was a dark one - and when you make that journey there will be casualties.",1161129600,12,2298,4.669135802469135

I see that some people have attempted to justify this rubbish by claiming that the two women involved, one of whom is raped another of whom is a prositute who sees a friend murdered, are getting their revenge on the male society which inflicted such horrors on them. Fair enough, but if that is so why did they not attempt to get revenge on the men who raped Manu ?

Controversial. Explicit. Uncut. In your face!  All true? Big yes. I feel it lives up to all the hype!

Two women kill - separately - two people and they decide to run. They meet at the train station and find out there are no trains going anywhere at that time of the night. They steal a car and go together and leave a trail of destruction behind them.

Combine this with explicit sex (even porn), lots of ultra violence and you've got a clear picture of Baise-Moi. The most controversial thing about this film are the sex-scenes, which are - at times - hardcore. I admire the fact the makers had the guts to film them and even let it pass in the editing room, but I have a suspicious feeling they did it just for the effect (and I'm glad they let it pass the editing room).

The violence is also explicit and sometimes gory. But ladies, nouvelle violence died about seven years ago. They also discuss the fact they should say something cool whenever they kill people. But somehow they never manage to really say anything important, to make a statement. Okay, they are both on the run and one of them was raped earlier in the film, but they never give a clear motivation for the killing. Is it they want to have revenge on ""all the men""?  Well, later in the film, in a sex-club, they also kill women?

Karen was found dead in a friend's apartment in Paris's 14th district on january 28th, only 9 days after her 32nd birthday. An apparent suicide, she left a note to her parents (only 2 words : too painful). She got married very young and blinded by love, agreed to make an adult film. Easy money.

And it's breaking my heart. She was such a sweet and nice person. She was always the first one to be happy for you when something good happened in your life.

1662953,4,B00005U12T,"""Baise-Moi"" is a French film in the grand tradition of notable director Gaspar Noe, the creator of such nihilistic cinematic nightmares as ""I Stand Alone"" and ""Irreversible."" In fact, in one scene in this film a character watches a scene from ""I Stand Alone"" on a television set. One wonders about Noe's reaction to ""Baise-Moi."" Was he flattered? Intrigued? Inspired to make more movies that might motivate others to create their own brand of extreme cinema? If anything, this film probably shocked the director. Certainly ""I Stand Alone"" and ""Irreversible"" are two very difficult films to watch let alone think about, but ""Baise-Moi"" beats both of them when it comes to sexual situations and disturbing violence. The writer and director of this film are both involved in the European adult film industry, if that tells you anything. Moreover, most of the actors in the picture work in that field as well. After watching this film, I know its appeal to a mass audience will be extremely limited. That's not to say the movie is nothing more than a pastiche of over the top scenes, as ""Baise-Moi"" most definitely conveys a serious message. Whether that message is original (it's not), or is more effective when portrayed in such an extreme manner, is open to debate.

The movie tells the story of two lower class French women named Manu (Raffaela Anderson) and Nadine (Karen Lancaume). Manu is a wanderer, a lost soul prowling the gritty French streets side by side with drug dealers, harridans, and other assorted riff raff. One day the young girl and a friend encounter a gang of unruly, menacing toughs with only one thing on their minds. After consummating the horrific act, shown in truly nauseating close up, Manu's embitterment about her life and her surroundings grows exponentially. Nadine, on the other hand, has her own unique troubles. Slaving away day after day as a woman of the night, she must continually endure the indignities such a profession thrives on. The filmmakers spare no sensibilities showing us the minutiae of one of her business dealings, perhaps in an effort to convince the viewer how ghastly, how emotionally and physically damaging, the occupation is. After establishing both characters' lives, chance events bring the two together after a local drug dealer perishes. At first, Manu and Nadine do not trust one another, which makes sense considering their rough upbringing. But eventually the two form a twisted bond, a bond requiring both of them to go on a mission of wanton violence against the human race. These are angry women far past the point of feeling an ounce of sympathy toward their fellow citizens. They prey on both men and women in their quest to even wrongs.

""Baise-Moi"" is your traditional revenge flick ramped up to high levels of emotional and physical violence. Moreover, and there's no better way to say this, the movie wallows in pornographic images. The filmmakers never shy away from close-ups of the most extreme acts, making this a film definitely unsuitable for kids. Heck, it's probably unsuitable for most adults if you've never seen a mature film. The movie goes so over the top in its depictions of sex and violence that the viewer might lose touch with the message and the performances let alone taking anything said or shown here seriously. Considering the actors in the film probably aren't familiar with the ins and outs of mainstream cinema, their portrayal of damaged human beings works surprisingly well. You can literally feel the two protagonists' rage pouring out of your television screen as one atrocity after another unfolds. Watching ""Baise-Moi"" sort of makes you wonder how many other ticking time bombs wander through the streets and back alleys of our decaying civilization. I called the film a traditional revenge film, and it is. Just think ""Thelma and Louise"" taken to explicit dimensions or the ""Death Wish"" films shot from the point of view of the crime victims to come up with a touchstone.

The title sums up the picture's message. The French infinitive ""baiser"" translates as ""to kiss,"" but like many words in our language the term carries multiple meanings. The French apparently assigned coarser definitions to the word, colorful usages that I won't get into here except to say that they hint at how men perceive women at different times. On the one hand, kissing points toward healthy emotions such as love and respect. The other meanings of the word conjure up images of misogyny, domination, and physical abuse. ""Baise-Moi"" challenges us to reconcile these two definitions, boldly stating that you can't have one without the other. Moreover, if society tacitly endorses a dualistic view of the female personality--one positive and the other deserving of negative attentions--don't act surprised when certain women seek retribution for vicious wrongs. Then again, perhaps I'm simply reading too much into this nihilistic excursion. ""Baise-Moi"" could just as well be a statement on the disintegration of French society due to massive and sustained unemployment, high crime rates, unchecked immigration, and the sudden realization that their waiters' obnoxious attitudes have reached an all time low.

Whatever the film ultimately means, you will never forget the experience of watching it. ""Baise-Moi"" barely cracks the seventy-minute mark, but you get a bunch of extras on the DVD to take up the slack. A trailer for the film, a photo gallery, and press clippings discussing the notoriety of the picture help flesh out the viewing experience. Crude, abrasive, and challenging--""Baise-Moi"" is sure to secure a special place in the realm of extreme cinema for some time to come. Films like this sort of make you wonder what they'll come up with to shock the audience in twenty or thirty years, don't they?",1094688000,59,5797,5.0480167014613775

1662955,1,B00005U12T,"Baise-Moi a.k.a. Rape Me has been banned in several countries throughout the world as it displays real sexual interaction between the characters and merciless violence that is burnt into your retina.  The story surrounds two young women, one working as a prostitute and the other an adult film performer who has recently been raped.  The argument that the women are victims is quickly discarded as both women seem to enjoy their occupation as they seek out environments where they can sexually interact with people.  Their quest-like adventure for sexual domination while executing the men and women that cross their paths serves no real purpose more than filling the empty void within, which could be lust, greed, or any other of the seven deadly sins.
Baise-Moi gives a reference to Gaspar No as the film displays a scene from I Stand Alone (1998) while one of the girls is selling her body to a customer.  No also directed a film named Irreversible (2002), which is in far more gruesome than Baise-Moi.  However, Irreversible displays an artistic intellect and a moral to the story despite the stomach turning violence to which most viewers must turn away their eyes.  In Baise-Moi there is not a direct moral to the story as the women show no remorse to their violent behavior which they happily embrace while cursing out their victims.  The film illustrates that two women can act like pigs in a similar fashion which men have done for centuries.  This is not a positive step forward for womanhood, but a couple of steps backwards.  In the end the film will make many wonder why they made this film, besides purely monetary purposes.

Now for the movie. I won't give anything away. This movie is about two women and their lives. Both are sick of the way they have been treated by society and people. The story tells a thrilling tale of what happens when someone snaps. That's all I am going to say about it. If you're expecting me to tell you the story well I don't do that sorry.

The acting is superub and although never seen before, the actors/actresses pull off a dynamic performance that keep you watching, makes you think, and even at times make you blink.

I see why the director wanted to make this as explicit as it is, this movie is about violence placed upon women and how women fight back, it would have given the movie less impact if it didn't show some sexuality and sex.

In Caligula, the hard core content was, despite its very explicit nature, more like a tongue-in-cheek attempt by producer Bob Guccione to spice up his film the only way he knows how. In Irreversible, the extended rape scene while bordering on the pornographic, was filmed in a way as to make it utterly shocking, disgusting and powerful and never gratitious. Indeed the whole film in its reversed style had a serene ending,and offered some relief to the viewers,albeit twisted.
Baiser-Moi,who was co directed and acted by porn veterans in their first mainstream attempt,is by contrast very nihilistic! Sex and violence are very much interlinked with no redemption for any of the characters. This fact has caused censors a lot of headaches, and although I am primarily against censorship in any form,I can somehow see where they were coming from.
Revenge is the main theme in Baiser Moi:The rape of one woman, leads to a series of murders of 'clients'by the two prostitutes,bonded by a strong friendship and a linked fate.
Maybe the only interesting aspect of the film is the fact that this friendship is never compromised,and despite the women's obvious hate of men, they do not turn to lesbianism,( even for the sake of increased viewing interest!)but rather remain strongly bonded by a platonic and intense affection.
The similarities between Thelma and Louise do exist obviously, but while Ridley Scott treated the relationship of the two women and their flight from injustice with grace and sympathy,Baiser Moi shows it in a raw,and 'in your face' style, and it can not get more 'in your face' than this!.
While in Thelma and Louise you leave the theatre with a sense of loss due to the sympathy you have developed for the two lead characters,in Baiser Moi you will wonder whether you will be able to watch any movies for some time.
If the hard core content interests you,think carefully, because the sex in Baiser Moi is vindictive, hateful and depressing, with a lot of pain and anxiety attached to it: None of the characters show or feel any pleasure in the sexual acts,for in their minds,the women have revenge and murder,and the men have exploitation and degradation.
Save your time and money on better films, and while the debate about pornography and art will probably never be resolved due to the highly subjective nature of this issue,you can be sure of one thing, Baiser Moi, does not succeed in either.",1074729600,6,2724,4.8982683982683985

Instead it seemed like the joke was on the audience, having been lured into this movie by it's gag only to find out it was a cruddy Thelma and Louise wannabe.  Baise-Moi isn't as original as it seems to think it is either.  Remember the other attempt to bring hardcore sex to mainstream film, Caligula?  Remember that failed as well?

I was not horrified, as some people have been, by the anti-male udercurrent in the movie (all it portrayed was that some women hate men.  Wow!).

The violence was not as graphic as Tarrantino has been (especially in Dusk Till Dawn, where he was particularly gratuitous)  Similarly the violence was not as random as Natural Born Killers.

1662974,1,B00005U12T,"To begin on the only positive note, Baise-moi is a useful movie for those who want to keep au courant with French street slang. Otherwise it's difficult to find a single redeeming feature in this appalling farago of violence and ennui.  Production values are poor (it was shot on digital video, resulting in a flat and badly-lit appearance), the plot line is simplistic explicit violence, and the protagonists are boring shallow people.
Baise-moi is an example of film making at its worst.  The so-called ""justification"" for a prolonged and vicious shooting spree is the rape of one of the protagonists, and the occupation of the other (a prostitute), coupled to a bad case of Euro-pretentiousness.  Nowhere is there an iota of compassion; neither by the two destructive divas nor by the film makers themselves.  Ordinary people are regarded simply as props to be destroyed.
One of the unfortunate consequences of the level of sexual repression in the American movie industry is that any film involving nudity or sexual acts is immediately branded as ""erotic.""  For example, the terribly poignant ""Yo Mama y Tambien"" was billed that way, whereas it was anything but a sex romp.  Likewise Baise-moi is marketed as a disturbingly erotic movie whereas it is simply disturbing.  This is a movie that will make you feel repulsed, that you will wish you had not seen, and that may lead you to reconsider any Francophilia you may formerly have harbored.",1058486400,5,1446,4.975103734439834
1662975,2,B00005U12T,"Me and some friends were bored one afternoon so we decided to rent a film. The cover of Baise Moi caught our attention, as did the caption of it being one of the most controversial films of its time. Well, controversial it sure is.
Shot in French (though obviously with English subtitles for the edition you'll buy here), this film is very gritty and dirty. There is no Hollywood romanticism surrounding it, no happiness and no sense of idealism. However, the whole film is so overly violent and so sexually gratuitous that it comes across as nothing other than an cheap action film and a cheap pornographic film melded into one so that the fat slob watching it doesn't have to get off his backside to change the video.
What surprised me even more was that film was supposedly ""anti-porn"". Clearly I have missed something somewhere. Would a film that was ""anti-porn"" really have a 60 year old woman fellating someone in the foreground while important characters have a conversation in the background? Would a supposedly ""anti-porn"" film really show a close up a woman having her period over a sink? Tasteless and disgusting are the sort of words I'd use, and I'm not easily offended (well, I wasn't offended, I just felt the whole thing was needlessly graphic for the sake of it). Whatever message that was intended to be given here is completely lost due to nothing short of poor film-making.
The storyline follows two women (a prostitute and a rape victim) who go on a rampage sleeping with and/or killing nearly every man they meet. It is in fact a very weak storyline, with nothing else happening other than tasteless sex scenes and poorly shot moments of violence. It sticks in your mind, but even then that is partially due to how cheap it was.
I suppose if this wasn't as grainy and cheap as it was it would have no effect. But a films lasting effect shouldn't simply be based on graphic sex scenes, rape and murder. It should be in its message. Fight Club had that, as did American History X. Quite simply, Baise-Moi does not. I could live with the cheapness if it was essentially a good film. I'd have no problem with the disturbing nature of some content if there was a message (or at least, something entertaining) to be found within it.
But truthfully, regardless of the random shootings and close ups of fellatio, masturbation and penetration, this is a boring and witless mess devoid of any intellectual or entertainment value. In fact, the only reason it gets two stars rather than one is because the graphic content does stay in your mind for some time afterwards.

1662977,2,B00005U12T,"having recently watched an interview with the filmmakers in the documentary ""Bad Girls"" my interpretation of Baise-Moi was confirmed. yes, as some reviewers have pointed out, this movie is a comment on a the exploitation of women in the sex-industry and, in some ways, is supposed to be ""anti-porn"" (""Pornography"" interpreted in the Dworkin sense). while i appreciate what the filmmakers were trying to do with this film i did not, however, appreciate the film because it ultimately failed at communicating this message.
 while some of the more film-trained audience would be able to decipher the message of Baise-Moi, most viewers--as many of the reviews here prove (most are convinced the movie is, indeed, porn and have judged it as either ""good"" porn or ""bad"" porn)--have been led to believe that the film *is* a porn flick and rate it accordingly. if a film can't communicate its message it ultimately fails as a film--especially when the directors have ended up creating a movie that supports the very industry they intended to criticize. indeed, the directors may be intelligent people but they are definitely *not* intelligent film makers. and this has nothing to do with the grainy look of the film it has to do with the entire way the film was carried off because, at the end of the viewing, most viewers are left feeling that they've just watched a porn and have to try very hard to find some critical message
(believe me, i watched this film with some feminist friends of mine and i was stupid enough to argue [unconvincingly because i did not really like the movie] for the film's supposed ""feminism""; they immediately claimed that was a typical male reaction to a film that they viewed as pro-porn.)

(Apparently the leader of the SPCS has to sell his house in order to pay his legal bill. He's not getting any sympathy from me).
Anyway I saw the movie this morning and didn't really see what the fuss is about. The basic plot resembles a cross between THELMA AND LOUISE and I SPIT ON  YOUR GRAVE. Two women, one a prostitute and one a porn star are both brutally gang raped (in explicit sexual detail) by a band of thugs and then set out on a nationwide killing spree, seducing and murdering men in general whle hunting down their degraders. The movie has a very grainy porn film type feel (the lead actresses are also porn stars)and the violence is sickening, in fact I felt rather queasy watching BAISE MOI, it makes I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (which to my knowledge is still banned in NZ) look like a PG-13 teen horror flick.

1662999,1,B00005U12T,"Subsequent to weeks of hysteria that controlled the media publicity at the time of Baise-Moi, I went to see the named film and view it in my own right. Based on former-prostitute Despentes novel of the same name, the gaunt story follows characters Manu & Nadine and their single-handed fight against the men of France as they go an orgy of murder and sex.
After Manu is raped in a downtown garage by two men, where her friend was also present and treated to the same ordeal, she teams up with Nadine in an underpass of a train station and offers her the chance of wreaking havoc by her side. Nadine accepts and the wafer-thin plot begins to unravel to tragic effect. Sleeping around ad treating men like dirt is where the kicks are found, before callously butchering them in various places from blows to organs to unmentionable to say. A prime example of the films nature is in one of the opening scenes when Nadine is masturbating on her bed to a pornographic film and when her friend enters, she fails to stop. Its with that the mentality of the films language becomes blindingly clear. Explicit as well as boring, Baise-Moi (roughly translated to Rape-Me in English) leaves nothing to the imagination as clear-cut images of rape and other sexual shenanigans are left for us to endure in this hard-core rendition of Ridley Scotts 1991 cult road-movie Thelma & Louise.
Originally filmed in 2000 on a shoestring budget, it took two years for Baise-Moi to finally reach our screens, although only a short amount of time was spent in England due to many cinema chains refusing to project the reels. Starring real-life porn actresses Anderson & Bach, the reason they were chosen was because they had both been raped for real in the past. Snipped by 7 seconds to excuse a now infamous penetration shot of Manus rape scene, the BBFC left the rest in their new plans to relax the guidelines for the cinema industry. Directors Despentes & Tri must have seen that their plot less script and Blair-Witch type photography was nothing more than a would-be, home-made, straight-to-video, shabby porn flick that deserves nothing more than what it gets. But, Baise-Moi hit the big time breeding on its controversy alone. It should have been a sign to the BBFC when France and liberal countries banned it outright. Cult status looks a promising outlook.

It is also MEANT to depict women revolting against ""the rules"" because men have kept women down for so long exploiting them and abusing them mentally, physically and emotionally so that two individual women of differing circumstances explode and kill in such a fury that ,I think, is meant to force us to examine our own roles in the way women are treated. WHY are women automatically associated with sex? WHY are women still thought of as ""not quite"" equal to men? WHY are women still abused and sold as meat in advertising?

Baise Moi may remind one in many ways of Thelma & Louise, I Spit on your Grave, or perhaps Natural Born Killers at times although the sex scenes are far more graphic than just about anything we've seen before.

It needs to rely on shock because there's nothing in the editing, camerawork etc that's any more than run-of-the-mill competent: roughly as good as an episode of an afternoon soap, in terms of actual quality.  But the afternoon soap would win, over all, because though its script will be pretty much drivel, it will still be, on average, better than the script here. It's true that _Baise moi_ ups the ante on film violence, and some people seem to think that makes it a milestone in film.  Nah, sorry.  Any fool can set that record - a record that I don't see as having any value or merit; is there anyone who really thinks: ""Oh, what we need in films is more pointless and affectless violence?""  But another film will soon come along and set a new record. And then there's politics. Female rage, check.  So it must be sort of feminist?  Nah, not really. The lead characters kill about as many women as men (though it's a fairly witless politics that thinks random killing is ""revenge"", regardless of the gender of the victims).  And guess what?  Though the lead characters sometimes kill men and women to rob them, or for laughs, mostly people in this film get killed for having sex.
Radical, yes?  Nah, radical no.  Pretty much same old same old, in terms of gun fetishising, pro-violence movies. As the lead characters murder the men and women in a sex club, I couldn't help thinking how much your basic Nazi would love this movie: big guns on the screen, and wasting the preverts, just because they're preverts, yay!  And make no mistake: the violence is presented uncritically by the film-makers: everything in the way the violence is filmed is intended to have you on the side of the people with the guns, and laughing at the victims as they die; like any fascist guns-r-good movie, but cross-dressed. This _is_ just another badly made exploitation film.  The 77 minutes felt like hours, to me.  There's no plot, and the dialogue, characterisation etc are way below contempt.  The film-makers try to get by on random sex, which is fine, but the emphasis is much more on random violence, which I can do without.  We all can, really. The film has two merits that nearly justify the minimum one star.  First, the way the early rape was filmed was appropriately horrific and confronting; for a very short time I thought this wasn't going to be a brainless exploitation flick.  But the film soon disillusioned me on that point.  Second, the two lead actors, I should say, are really good.  Both turn in acting appearances that far outshine anything else in the film.  They both deserve to be in better films.  And since I'll bet the porn films they were in were much less violent than this, the fact is: they already have been.

1663029,5,B00005U12T,"Wow!  I loved this picture.  If I have any complaints, it would only be that I wish the picture was more sharp, but I think they  made it that way for a reason.  This picture took a lot of courage to make, and to the director's and the two actresses, kudos for making it.  I have reviewed a lot of movies here on amazon, and if you have ever read my reviews you know I love shock value in a movie.  ""Ilsa-She Wolf of the SS"", ""Red to Kill"", ""Henry-Portrait of a Serial Killer"", just to name a few.  Needless to say, I'm a bit jaded with what is put out in todays society.  Well this movie is one of the guttiest films ever made. If you have a problem with this film, get a grip!  I've been waiting for the day that the adult industry and mainstream films made the connection, and I think this is the start of things to come.  If MTV can show what they are showing, and regular tv shows can give MA-TV ratings, then why can't they make movies aimed at an adult audiance?  If parents can't control what their kids watch, who's fault is that?  Certainly not the director's, nor the store that sells the movies(unless they sell them to under age kids).  So what's the problem?  Give the movie a rating it deserves and let the adult audiance choose if they want to see it or not.  Some people say that there is no reason to show such explict sex and violence in a film.  Well I disagree.  If it is unnessasary sex and violence then yeah, they have a point.  But in some films it is important to the story line, as in ""Boise Moi"".  For example, now try to have an open mind and listen to what I'm saying.  Take the rape scene in this film.  Now we all know how awful a crime rape is and how much it affects the victim's life.  I think anybody who commits such crimes should be executed.  But think about this, your watching a movie and two girls are raped.  But instead of seeing the act, the director shows a little struggle then basicly implies the act without showing it.  Then the two ladies, go on a killing spree picking victims at random(inoccent people).  Whould you really sympathize with the killers or would you just say, they shouldn't do that, they should just get help?  Now take the same situation, but this time the director doesn't hold back and shows you everything.  The girls are dragged to an empty looking warehouse, are punched and headbutted in the face till their bleeding pretty bad.  Then their clothes are ripped off them, and you see the rapist actually penatrate the girls as they scream and try helplessly to fight them off.  Then they just leave the girls lying on the concrete floor abused and bleeding.  Now would you have sympathy for those two women?  Well let me tell ya, me personally, I could understand the frustration and rage these girls felt and I'm not even a woman.  I was so angry after that scene that I actually had to stop the film for a few minutes and settle down.  That's the difference of having or not having shock value in a movie.  It turns your emotions up a level.  Movies that simply imply things don't usually get you that worked up.  That's what films are supposed to do, play with your emotions.  That's why we watch them.  Now, different people watch different movies that bring out these emotions in other ways.  Some people like tear-jerkers, some like romance, while others like horror.  There are a million different genre of films out there.  But in these movies the scenes that draw on these different emotions aren't implied,  there shown.  I know, I know,  your thinking this is not the same thing as a romance or a tear-jerker.  But that's my whole point, let the public decide what they want to watch and what emotions they want stirred up.  We live in the greatest country in the world, and we are free to watch what we want, under the first amendment. So why are the censorship laws so strict here?  I have a eighteen month old son, and like I said it's up to the parents to make sure their kids don't see these types of movies.  That dosn't mean that we, as adults, shouldn't have the choice to see them if we so choose.  So if you feel liking seeing a excellant adult film, get this movie.  It's definatly one of a kind, I just hope it's not the last of it's kind.  NEVER FORGET 9/11/01!!!!",1019001600,8,4261,4.329113924050633
1663030,1,B00005U12T,"Tonight, as the end credits rolled up the screen, the cinema patrons stood up in unison and there was a rush for the exits - within sixty seconds it was just me and a friend alone with a lot of red drapery.  Never have I seen a cinema empty so quickly or conclusively - usually there are at least a few stragglers: the afficianado who must know the name of the best boy and the gaffer; the bearded man with a large plastic bag and a camouflage jacket; the woman in the Dizzy Gillespie glasses chatting to the man with the shaved head and the black turtleneck - but even these characters escaped for the safety of the real world.  This is a film from which you might well want to run away.
*
Prior to viewing this, all I knew about it was that it was French, that the title was quite funny (it does not mean 'rape me'), and that it was billed as 'provocative' and 'uncut'.  After viewing it, I felt I had seen a poorly executed attempt to shock people into recognition of (cliched) gender issues.
*
The violence was as gruesome as in a zombie movie or a Steven Segal flick (I make this distinction as I have it on good authority that, contrary to all appearances, Mr. Segal is not, in fact, a zombie) - farcical violence, true, but also dull.  The sex was real but unflattering to those partaking and to those viewing - the rape scene in particular was brutal, but the aftermath, indeed the film as a whole, trivialised the crime.  Guns were fetishised (how original), and this fetish was satirised (how original).  The central characters were lost and unloved, and, for me, this was a dim flicker of redemption, in that they evoked some sympathy, but otherwise they exhibited only a rudimentary humanity which meant their fate was robbed of much, if not all, interest.  There seemed to be some kind of implicit thesis about race issues in France, as many of the minor characters appeared North African or Arabic, but this was not explored in any enlightening way.  The cinematography was forgettable, and the dialogue lame.
*
There really seems little point in seeing this film.  It seems safe to assume that most people potentially interested in seeing a 'provocative French film' would already know that women's sexuality can be exploited by men.  Would they find gratuitous gruesome murder and humiliation entertaining, or humorous, given the director considers the film a black comedy?  I somehow doubt it.  The director has a low opinion of her audience - it seems she considers us stupid.  Catherine Breillat is several leagues above this in sophistication - see one of her films if you want to see a similar terrain mapped with intelligence and incisiveness, and a touch of humour.",1018656000,5,2688,4.610062893081761

It is amazing what you can get away with if you call it 'art' nowadays. I wonder if this film was made in Britain,not France, it would be getting released like this .I doubt it somehow. The fairly depressing story revolves around a couple of lowlife girls in prostitution ,drugs etc who meet up by chance and because they are fed uo with being abused and even raped by men they go on a killing spree. Unfortunatley,which put me off the story a bit,instead of going after the evil criminals and pimps who did it to them ,they just start killing innocent civilians as well ,basically anyone who gets in their way.

1663053,1,B00005U12T,"If you want cinematic gut punches, go for a film that's actually quoted in Baise-Moi and shown in one of the sequences:  Gaspar Noe's I Stand Alone.  Baise-Moi is amateurishly filmed, extremely poorly written, and just not really all that interesting -- its only saving grace is the somewhat surprising fact that its two ex-porn-star leads actually have some cinematic presence.  Small compensation for what is basically and sex-and-gore flick done by people who have no idea how to make a film.
I don't know what Virginie Despentes' original novel was like, but if its story is anything like the lame excuse for a plot in Baise-Moi the movie, then it's a book to avoid indeed.  Baise-Moi's ""script"" is nothing more than a paratactical series of events with no connection to one another, no logic, and not an iota of emotional effect.  The dialogue is laughable, kind of an unholy marriage of bad bravado with Militant Feminism 101.  Most grievously, Despentes and co-director Coralie Trinh Thi have crafted incredibly shallow characters through which to say what they want.  Beyond the fact that they are angry and have been exploited by men in their lives, we know nothing about Manu and Nadine.  At points where there's a chance to let them express some internal complexity, the characters are sabotaged by bad filmmaking.  For example, Despentes and Trinh Thi inexplicably ellipse the first time Manu commits cold-blooded, premeditative murder, thus destroying the most important step in Manu's future as a character.  When the two women first meet, we have snippets of badly scripted dialogue, and then immediately we see them dance semi-naked to the radio, and that is this movie's excuse for characters bonding.
The awful scripting is then married to preposterous filming.  I can understand why they opted to shoot handheld on video, but shooting every scene in extreme close-up has the effect of flattening any peaks and valleys this movie could have had.  Absolutely heinous editing makes the supposed shock sequences flatter than a pancake.  The shooting of Manu's boyfriend and the strangling of Nadine's roommate (shown in parallel) are both rendered harmless and ridiculous by bad filming, so that you can only tell what happened by inference.  And too much bad music keeps interfering with the action onscreen, possibly a crutch to disguise how poorly this film was edited together.  Unfortunately, the music only serves to deepen the stink.
Despentes and Trinh Thi both insisted that this film is supposed to be a horrific comedy of sorts, that you're not supposed to take it seriously.  And yes, outrageous comedy can often be an unusually effective vehicle for unexpected pathos.  Too bad for Baise-Moi, then, that not only does it fail at pathos or social significance, it also doesn't draw laughs, or shock, or even make you care enough -- all due to bad execution.  In fact, the only element that makes this movie less than a complete bust is that Karen Bach and Raffaela Anderson have some interesting moments.  Where the script fails, sometimes Bach and Anderson almost rescue it with their surprisingly watchable performances.  This was especially unusual given the horrendous supporting cast, so I suspect credit is due not to the directors but to the actresses themselves.
At any rate, the accolades this film has received positively baffles me.  I've seen better executed home movies than this.  While the idea of a more explosive, no-holds-barred version of Thelma and Louise appeals to me, Baise-Moi falls flat in its intention.",1009584000,15,3556,5.073883161512027

When Manu is brutally [abused] she is pushed over the edge with a rage that only killing will cure.
Nadine is a tough-skinned prostitute with a hate for herself and what she has become.
A chance encounter brings the two women together and what ensues is a road trip filled with sex, and blood-shed ultimately forcing the two to question what life has in store for them, and if life is worth living.
Going further into the plot of this movie would be difficult for there is not much to say other than it is VERY SEXUALLY EXPLICIT.  The film is a lot like `Thelma And Louise' the only two differences are:
it's in French, and the sex scenes are that of porno films.
Many might be offended by the graphic nature of this film, but the director chose to be hard-core to show the brutal life these women lead.  Using men for sex, and then either discarding them or killing them Manu and Nadine enact their revenge for a world they feel has made them monsters.
The two main characters are played by veterans of the French adult film industry, so it should come as no surprise how graphic this movie is, and if anyone is looking for a sexy, erotic film look elsewhere because this isn't it...this movie is a tough and serious depiction of two twisted women on a rage-filled journey into madness.

I hated ""Thelma and Louise"" but at least it was well made with good camera work and good acting and a well thought out plot.

I purchased this DVD through Amazon with a different cover and it came out of South Korea. This particular cover  was not available at the time but I believe they are the same movie. The movie is French with English subtitles.

One of the reviews said that there was lots of graphic ""porno""  sex. If that is what you are looking for you will be severely disappointed.

There are 2 main women in the movie. One is a smaller woman porn actress (but we don't see any of her films) and the other is a taller and more attractive ""call girl."" They live in a neighborhood  full of low life thugs and drug dealers. The less attractive porn actress and another woman are raped. A male friend of the porn actress has a gun and wants to go after the rapists. The porn star gets angry because her male friend is more concerned about revenge rather than asking her about her feelings and so she uses his gun and shoots him dead in the forehead and takes his money.

The porn star or PS accidentally meets  the call girl or CG while walking down an otherwise deserted street and the PS asks the CG if she can drive a car. The CG declines the offer but PS pulls a gun and forces CG to drive. The next scene shows them robbing an attractive woman at an ATM and then shooting her dead. This crime is repeated about 2 more times.

They then pick up an unattractive man in a bar and bring him back to their hotel room for sex. The man makes the error of wanting to use a condom.
Because he wants to use a condom for ""safe sex"" both girls stomp him to death.

They then go to a gun store and while the owner is showing them automatic pistols  both women shoot him to death. (I didn't know that they had gun stores in France or sold pistols to civilians.)  It appears that they take several pistols and one has a laser sight.

The next brief scene takes place at night and as the 2 women are  walking along a small street a man makes a very sexual proposition to them and the PS shoots him multiple times (dead)

They come across another man who has left his car running at an ATM and they take the car and run over the man so that they can have the car..

They leave Paris and along the way they stop at what they think is a  nightclub or bar. It turns out to be a sex club and for whatever senseless & unmotivated reason they shoot everyone in the club,both men & women. This event is very graphic and bloody because of the body count.

They are finally stopped a police road block but they kill both policemen and take off with a female witness who begs not to be left behind at the crime scene. They end up at the house of the female witness where the husband of the witness tips them off to a rich guy that the husband doesn't  like and tells PS & CG to go rob him. PS & CG go the man's house and have him open his safe and then shoot him to death.

They  are driving during the day and stop at a roadside store. PS goes into the store while CG stays behind the wheel of the car. It appears that CG thinks than PS is only going to make a purchase. Shots ring out from the store and CG runs in to find that the store owner has killed PS. CG then shoots the owner of the store and takes the body of PS with her in the car.

CG takes the body of PS to the shore of a lake and burns the body with gasoline. In the next scene CG is ""contemplating"" suicide with an automatic pistol to her right temple while standing by another lake. The acting in this scene is extremely unconvincing.
