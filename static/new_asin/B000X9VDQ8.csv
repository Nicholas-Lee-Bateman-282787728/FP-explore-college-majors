Alaska Airlines has a very unique environment & the 737-200 is truly amazing.
my fist ever time to be in an airplane wan in similar type back in the 80's. I loved aviation ever since",1399075200,,231,4.155555555555556
8227456,4,B000X9VDQ8,"I have lots and lots of miles in the back of these things.  Penance for blowing your per diem in Anchorage's sin dens is having God's own hangover and riding in the back of one of these things to Bethel or Kotzebue.  That infernal racket ending makes you happy to get to places like Bethel or Kotzebue.

They were a major part of Alaska's history and lots of us have lots of memories attached to traveling on them.  If you're looking for something technical on the 737 Combi, this isn't it.  There is a lot of good scenery and familiar faces doing familiar things if you've travelled rural Alaska.

For those of you who haven't and buy this, the pictures in this video are the only time I've EVER seen a 737 Combi so clean!",1231286400,4,723,4.318518518518519
8227457,5,B000X9VDQ8,"I'm a big fan of aviation. A flightsimaholic who owns most of the modern and classic aircraft on payware software for Flightsim 2004 and FSX. This video is well done and since it deals with Alaska Airlines it is unique with the particular destinations only they fly. The previous review was critical on too much cockpit chatter but I found this very needful and entertaining. This is a long video which is why it has the time to listen to the pilots who actually fly the aircraft. If the video only delt with the aircraft as a technical and informational overview I would have found that boring. You get to know the pilots and their experience from a personal level. This DVD takes you to the very last flight for the 737-200 model with Alaska Airlines. Very nostalgic and historical documentary covering operations in extreme cold weather and travel to very unique and remote airports. This is a must have for aviation enthusiast. If you have the interest and devotion to aviation (that not all people have) you will love this video. I won't be selling this DVD on Amazon or Ebay, its a keeper",1214092800,7,1094,4.615384615384615
8227458,3,B000X9VDQ8,"After reading reviews on this in Airways Magazine and other magazines, I finally purchased this DVD.  It doesn't live up to the hype.  Of course, I broke my number one rule when it comes to reviews: I bought it.  Normally, unless I can see an item reviewed with my own eyes, I don't buy it based solely upon a review in a magazine that also sells what it reviews.

While the outdoor shots of the 737-200QC are interesting, too much of the video is taken with views of the pilots talking.  They should have used the pilots' speeches as background while filming the rest of the aircraft.

The second disc is mostly a rehash of selected segments of the main disk.",1196121600,4,660,4.413223140495868
