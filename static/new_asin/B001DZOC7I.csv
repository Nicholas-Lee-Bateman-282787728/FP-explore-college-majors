8295723,5,B001DZOC7I,"Great horror movies in sea of mediocrity.  The third movie of the series is a little off the top and approaches true B-grade demotion.
However, the series belongs in every horror freak's library.

This review is coming from a horror fanatic.  Yeah, I like horror with no ""comic relief"" or happily-ever-after endings.

Note: see the 1971 masterpiece of Spielberg ""The Duel"" from which the Joy Rides is patterned after.",1428796800,,417,5.0

8295725,3,B001DZOC7I,"The movies are great and good to add to a horror movie collection but this particular 2-pack didn't look new.  One movie was shrink wrapped inside the case and the other was not.  The DVD's looked brand new but the cases did not.  One case actually had a damaged movie artwork/insert inside the case.  It wasn't in collectors condition.

I should have asked for a replacement but felt it too much trouble.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed watching the movies again.",1422144000,,456,4.708860759493671
8295726,4,B001DZOC7I,Had seen the movies back when they first hit the video shelf. Good entertainment without a lot of over the top special effects. I thought LeeLee Sobieski had a bigger role but after seeing the first Joyride shee seems to be just an afterthought. Still a worthwhile purchase.,1392681600,,274,4.729166666666667
8295727,5,B001DZOC7I,"I loved the 1st joy ride,with Ted levine as the voice of rusty nail,the psychopath killer. Also,the spine tingling suspense of the movie made it a joy to go on the ride. Lee Lee Sobieski and Paul walker had a great romantic connection plus I liked how the brother played by Steve Zahn,tried to move in on his bro's girl,after he'd gotten her drunk,Yet rusty nail called right before he could take advantage of Venna! I didn't like that Ted Levine didn't reprise the voice in the 2nd movie but it was great to see a sequel cuz at the end of the 1st Joy ride,rusty nail got away and lived to torture kids another day.! I hpoe they make a 3rd joy ride!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joy-Ride-2-Pack/dp/B001DZOC7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joy Ride 2-Pack</a>",1299110400,,795,5.170542635658915
8295728,5,B001DZOC7I,Joyride was a stunning movie... I used to work in a fuel stop and after seeing that movie it made me think twice about messing with truckers!... lol.. joyride 2 was pretty good... a little different from the first but overall a great flick!...,1226793600,2,243,4.545454545454546
