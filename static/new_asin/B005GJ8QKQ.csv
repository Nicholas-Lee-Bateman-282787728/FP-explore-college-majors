8471703,5,B005GJ8QKQ,"GhettoPhysics is a raucous documentary DVD from William Arntz -- who is the co-creator of What the Bleep Do We Know?! -- on life as we have collectively created it. The film shows the possibility of creating a new paradigm -- that we don't have to settle for the dog-eat-dog society we've always known. GhettoPhysics holds that each person must take responsibility for changing the phenomenon of ""pimps and hos,"" because pimps and hos do not exist only in the ghetto, as many of us would like to believe, but they also envelope our whole system of commerce. The film examines the interplay between power players and their foot soldiers and how that dynamic is the simplest expression of how power is wielded in the world. Even in the spiritual community there are bona fide pimps and hos -- we cannot hide from this timeless game of power even though it may make us uncomfortable in our ever-so-clean skin. GhettoPhysics can hit every one of us where we are sure to feel it -- physically, emotionally and spiritually.

8471704,3,B005GJ8QKQ,"I am a huge fan of 'What the Bleep,' bought the extended version and found much useful information.

After watching ""Ghetto Physics"" a second time, I find E. Raymond Brown is a bit too intense. Trying to say he's not preaching, but promoting a particular course of action one should take. Ghetto Physics does present  interesting points of view about our behavior choices, asking, are we being a 'ho' or 'pimp.'

Both movies though, do skip over the fact that much of one's 'adult behavior' has been conditioned by happenings from experiences (good or bad) during early childhood development. Much of the negative adult behavior is caused from decisions that one's inexperienced mind made during traumatic or hurtful situations and experiences. We are then unconsciously guided in whatever situations look similar in any way by our survival mind. One's survival mind is good at coloring current situations to distort what's really happening, triggering panic, or survival actions.

By the time we're adults, one needs to start working through all that and it can be a painful journey for many which both movies ignore or dismiss too lightly. They both suggest that we in our 'adult' minds are behaving blindly, ignorantly, and poke fun of that. That is not the truth.

I appreciate that they both though bring to light the power of unconscious mind and raise awareness to steps one can take to untangle from all that crazy thinking. It is a painful, but very empowering, useful, freeing, uplifting journey to take.

I appreciate deeply that both men have taken the time to produce work that points the light on new possibilities and conscious ways of living more empowered lives.

It would be fabulous to see that children would not be mindlessly herded into school, forced to learn so much nonsensical information, forced to be conditioned to 'the power out there,' rather than being guided, encouraged to live as empowered beings.

I also find it very heartless that E. Raymond Brown like so many others, keeps talking about 'the game,' referring to life. This so ignores the incredible sorrow, terror, craziness and hurt purposefully inflicted on so many children around the world by the greed mongers. I'm sure in their minds, it is not a game.

I found it shocking that John Perkins, a former World Bank 'Economic Hit Man' would so casually talk about all the destruction he and his fellow goons caused in many countries.

I found much of what Hank Wesselman, PhD, anthropologist/shamanic teacher had to say.

I think this is still worth watching.",1327622400,5,2552,4.953161592505855
8471705,3,B005GJ8QKQ,"This video is from some of the same people who made What the Bleep do I Know? , which was exciting and uplifting, and based upon implications of some of the discoveries in quantum physics. I was pulling for this video to perform some similar magic. Sadly,while choosing to frame the subject of control and power exchange in our society as pimps and ho's wasn't inaccurate, it was depressing. I can't see myself wanting to watch it again, unlike the many times I enjoyed What the Bleep! I even bought the extended version of WTB called Down the Rabbit Hole and watched that version multiple times. So when I tell you how regretful I am that this video flopped you can see that I'm a member of the choir who is saying that, and its not just the voice of a traditional foe of all that is not traditional thought. (You know those reviews. They are always one or two star ratings of ,mostly, scathing anger that any thought outside of the main stream dares to exist in their world.)

The humor of pimping and ho-ing is too thin to carry this message of power and control in society. In hindsight I'd say an old fashioned carny with marks, shills and hustlers might have been more effective. Perhaps then we would laugh at our gullibility and not avert our eyes, as I did, from Ghetto Physics. Content, good; presentation, ineffective = 3 stars.",1323302400,8,1339,4.510288065843621
8471706,5,B005GJ8QKQ,"GHETTO PHYSICS!!!! What happens when What The Bleep meets Martin Luther King Jr.? A metaphysical tour de force documentary is born.  The documentary Ghetto Physics met every expectation I had hoped. As a spiritual leader of a socially aware religious community, E.Raymond Brown's movie brought the esoteric concepts in metaphysics to earth, by revealing how the PIMP/HO archetype expresses itself not just on the ghetto streets of America where its most familiar but also it extended the archetype to show its manifestation in geo politics, religion and Wall street. In fact, Ghetto Physics forces you to meet the pimp/ho in your own being. This was most difficult for many who watched this documentary with me.

KRS-One and Ice-T analysis of the pimp/ho energy that moves our society was deeply effective. What was even more appreciative was John Perkins, of Economic Hitman fame and Hank Wesselman whose work with various shamans added universal understanding of this archetype and how we can alter our social consciousness to save the planet from the tyrannical pimps and unconscious HO's who are bringing our world to self destruction.

But what I loved most about Ghetto Physics was the incorporation of Dr. Martin L. King Jr., Cornel West and Cynthia McKinney prophetic vision. So many so called ""Conscious Movies"" have left out the metaphysical/spiritual contributions of Black socio-political activist. Ghetto Physics corrects this omission, reminding us that true metaphysics can't divorce itself from whats happening in the streets of urban America and how these communities are being pimped by unfettered capitalistic lust, which have bred opportunistic pyschic and social vampirish behavior among the people.

Ghetto Physics moves us beyond the divide and conqueor rhettoric of us vs them in ethnocentric religion, politics and economics. It forces us to realize that we are one, we are responsible for not only ourselves but our planet and most importantly, WE HAVE OPTIONS and can make a difference. As Above, So Below, As Within, So Without.",1321228800,15,2056,5.2975460122699385
