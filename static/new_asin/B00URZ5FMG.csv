8707946,5,B00URZ5FMG,"Nathan is on the spectrum he is therefore gifted and has a particular bent for mathematics. Yes he finds algebra and co actually exciting. He has suffered a personal tragedy as a child and has found it hard to come to terms with. He finds it hard to connect with most things that the majority of us would take in our stride too.

Then his loving mum  Sally Hawkins of Happy Go Lucky fame  manages to secure him a maths teacher at his new school. This is a man who has never lived up to his or anyone elses expectations  Martin Humphreys - played by the talented Rafe Spall. Soon Nathan is discovering that being good at maths means you can be looked up to by simple dint of being good at something and so begins his slow blossoming of finding out where he fits in with the World.

As you would expect from a film that also boasts the talents of Eddie Marsan this is well acted  everyone is convincing including some very young actors too. Directed by Morgan Mathews who is better known for his documentary work, he proves here he is a man of talent and vision. There are a lot of camera techniques here  like the falling rain shots  that we do not see so much - unlike Korean cinema, so praise is due to all concerned. It is altogether beautifully made with a tempo that balances the atmosphere of stress with the warmth of life just perfectly. I had put off seeing this for some inexplicable reason and now think my decision to finally view it was one of the best I have made this year  thoroughly recommended.",1451433600,,1511,4.310954063604241

8707949,1,B00URZ5FMG,"I wanted to like this movie. It has an interesting and original premise about the Mathematics Olympiad and focuses on a member of the UK team who has autism. But I felt the film was very cliche, maudlin, and dull. The acting I thought was also rather awkward. It's hard to make a film about math entertaining for most people. But it can be done. I think this one flopped because it failed to bring something truly edgy and gripping but instead relied on the old tropes about mathematicians and people with autism spectrum disorder.",1444435200,3,531,4.6
8707950,5,B00URZ5FMG,"Having enjoyed ""Hugo"" and Ender's Game"" with the young, very talented Asa Butterfield, I decided to check out this very different type of movie.  No doubt Asa's character in X+Y was a difficult challenge for this actor, but he nailed it once again.  X+Y is a slow-paced movie with emphasis on character development and won't appeal to the car-chase, CGI explosions type of audience, but my wife and I enjoyed it very much.  One cannot help but to be better informed about autism and its challenges after seeing this movie.  The ending is not what you would anticipate and for that matter the whole movie is unlike any we have seen before.  We need more movies that make you think and learn like this one.  Check it out, you won't be sorry that you did.  Note: I don't think the DVD is available in the US format, so you will need a universal player to see it.",1444003200,2,859,4.43312101910828

8707952,5,B00URZ5FMG,"This is an excellent art house movie about Nathan (superbly played by Asa Butterfield) a socially awkward teenager and maths prodigy, who overcomes adversity and enters an international mathematics competition.

On the way, he finds love, acceptance and insight.

This is a well made film, with uniformly excellent performances, a well written and nuanced script, and sensitive direction.

The film makers have taken what could be a difficult subject (Nathan has an autistic spectrum condition) and made a sensitive, poignant, charming and appealing film which successfully blends drama and comedy to make an entertaining and rewarding experience.

What is it about?

Nathan is a teenager who struggles to connect with others, including his loving parents.

The story opens with tragedy: Nathan and his father are involved in a motor accident, in which his father is killed.

His mother Julie (an excellent performance from Sally Hawkins) tries hard to raise Nathan as a single parent, and encourages Nathan when he is discovered to be a mathematics genius.

The story then moves on to follow Nathan's participation in the International Mathematics Olympiad, exploring several themes:

- Nathan's growth in understanding of human feelings and emotions
- the competition and characters involved in an international maths contest
- the emotions felt by a mother with a demanding teenage prodigy
- the unconventional teacher who becomes Nathan's teacher and later his mother's companion
- teenage first love

This is a special movie, and a rewarding experience.",1441670400,6,1558,5.400826446280992
