4212961,2,B003VZ8JDQ,"Woke Up Dead has an excellent cast of actors, so I was surprised at how much of a let-down the DVD was. Woke Up Dead isn't really a traditional movie. It's a string of 22 episodes of a show that was streamed on the internet in 2009.

The webisode series followed Drex Greene (Napoleon Dynamite), a zombie who tries to discover the secret behind a mysterious pill that made him ""wake up dead."" He's aided by his camera-toting buddy Matt, and Cassie, an especially hot medical student.

The good news: the casting is great. Jon Heder of Napoleon Dynamite stars as Drex, Josh Gad from ""21"" plays his roommate, and friend, and the beautiful Krysten Ritter (Breaking Bad) is Drex's med student love interest. Add to the mix Wayne Knight (Newman from Seinfeld), Meital Dohan (Weeds), and Ellia English (Curb Your Enthusiasm), and it looks like you'd have a hit DVD.

The problem? The writing is downright boring. It's not a legit ""zombie"" flick, and it's just not funny. The editing gives it the feel of a Nickelodeon program, but with adult themes. The product placement for Kodak throughout the program also starts to get a little annoying after a while.

What's worse is that the ""movie"" ends on a cliffhanger, since it's a compilation of the first season of the webisodes. You don't get to find out what happens to Drex (in the middle of an explanation), nor how he became a zombie. Since a second season hasn't even been announced, we're at least a year away from even finding out how the story ends.

The bottom line: This was a great collection of actors, all underused because of weak writing and a low budget. A film about a guy trying to make a discovery ends mid-story with no explanations and no closure. Why this was released on DVD before a second season was even filmed is a complete mystery to me, I wouldn't even suggesting renting it.",1286236800,9,1846,4.598784194528875

8407213,4,B003VZ8JDQ,"Drex (Jon Heder) wakes up dead. His roommate (Josh Gad) is a digesting perv who films and posts everything. Drex attempts to find clues as to what has happened to him  with Cassie (Krysten Ritter) a med student helping out.

In spite of being dead. Drex has acquired super human skills and speeds. There is a subplot at work and just when his mother is about to explain what has happened to Drex, the film ends. Sorry about revealing the spoiler wasn't revealed, although there are enough clues for us to make an educated guess, The film which I obtained at ""Big Lots"" for $5.00 is a  TV series pilot or the first episode of a 24 episode series which I never watched while it was on TV. As a stand alone film, it tanks at the end. In spite of that I liked this episode, although clearly it was neither great or a classic, just some good unorthodox Jon Heder fun.",1437091200,,862,4.308641975308642
8407214,1,B003VZ8JDQ,"A Terrible Boring Stupid Movie. I hate to do this. I only do it when  a movie is really, really, really bad.. Annoying characters, especiually the fat Jack Black clone roomate, the fat Negro female supervisor, the fat guy in the next cubicle at work, the fat secret spy, the skinny chipmunk-voiced chick med' student, and the ugly embalmed-looking mother. Absolutely nothing happens in this movie and it makes no sense at all and has no discernible plot or believability. It stinks.",1435017600,,482,4.878048780487805
8407215,4,B003VZ8JDQ,I say this on Crackle. I liked the storyline. The biggest let down is that the series wasn't allowed to continue. Hopefully Sony Entertainment will do a Season 2 to this.,1420588800,,170,4.516129032258065
8407216,2,B003VZ8JDQ,"Woke Up Dead (2010)

 I like sideways takes on the Zombie experience and count this as one of them.  A guy takes a drug at a party and the next morning he wakes up dead.  He gathers a helper in the med student who nearly cut him open in the morgue.  The pair and his totally jerky room mate try to figure out how, what and why this happened to him.  I found it fun to watch.
 Jon Heder plays Drex Green, the guy who Woke Up Dead.  We know him from the very popular Napoleon Dynamite.  Krysten Ritter plays Cassie, the med student.  Ritter has a long list of credits on TV and in films.  She has also worked as a model and plays guitar in a band called Ex-Vivian.  She has many talent.  Matt, the jerk room mate, is played by Josh Gad.  He also has a number of TV and film roles as a number of voice only roles as well.
 While Drex and Cassie focus on finding out why Drex can function just fine even with no heartbeat, his room mate films everything.  He wants to break into the film business and has no scruples what so ever.  Matt encourages Drex to fall off buildings and what not to make dramatic film episodes.  As a dead guy, Drex cannot suffer harm in these stunts.  Matt had a previous career making up the skirt films of random women so this actually makes for a professional improvement for him.
 Other cast members include Wayne Knight (Seinfeld) and Jean Smart, a long time movie and
TV actress best know from her five year stint on Designing Women.  Israeli born Meital Dohan plays another Zombie in the confusing script.
 After watching Woke Up Dead I discovered that rather than a movie the project was actually a 22 episode web cast.  They made the DVD version by simply patching together the 22 three to seven minute episodes into a single long strip.  Which explains why the stupid thing just stops.  Woke Up Dead does not end, it does not resolve the many issues in the plot line.  It simply stops.  We never find out who the government watchers are.  We do not find out what mysterious happenings on a commune years ago may have led to the Zombification of Drex.
 The web people never made any more episodes after 2009 so we will never find out.  I feel a great sense of disappointment.  And I feel ripped off.  We don't get a Zombie movie, we get part of a Zombie movie, a movie with great potential but no pay off.  Bummer.
 This near movie lasts for one hour and 24 minutes and has no movie rating but might rate a PG-13.  No naked people or bad language.  Even though I liked what we get, we don't get enough and so the film gets a miserable two brains.  Watch only if you enjoy being frustrated.",1420329600,,2620,4.241379310344827
8407217,1,B003VZ8JDQ,"I watched this dvd it had a good start, and a good middle, but 100% no ending. What a waste of time, Nothing is resolved, you never find out what happens. This movie sucks, don't buy it, it totally sucks.",1378339200,,204,4.125
8407218,2,B003VZ8JDQ,"Most of this story consists of trying to figure out how he became a zombie and just what that means.  His sleazy best friend and a pretty medical student pal around like an old 1980's teen movie, dealing with new clues, medical data, a mysterious female zombie, and an evil guy in a surveillance van.  I almost expected Scooby Doo and Shaggy to be sitting at their table shuffling lunch meat like a deck of cards.",1373846400,,413,4.421052631578948
8407219,2,B003VZ8JDQ,"Woke up Dead is the creation of John Fasano who has a slew of titles under his belt for writing, producing, directing, and acting. While I haven't seen most of what he has worked on previously there are two movies he's written that I HAVE seen - Darkness Falls and Another 48 Hours. Not too much on the horror front but this one is more of a comedy than a horror film. Of course with the main star being Jon Heder I doubt anyone figured it would be anything but hilarious (unless of course you hate Heder.)

Woke Up Dead originally was 'aired' in webisode format on Crackle and I was a bit surprised that the film was put together so well. As I mentioned it started as webisodes. 22 4 minute webisodes put together into a feature film which is now ready for you to enjoy.

The story begins with Drex Green (Jon Heder) whose heart was broken and ends up wanting to take a cold bath. The only problem this cold bath ends up with him being under water for 15 minutes and 'woke up dead' after.) His best friend, a film student named Matt (Josh Gad) discovers him and has the recorded proof that he was under water for too long and wants to make a web series about the While at first that's a bit of a stretch he's hit by a bus soon after and with no heartbeat is tossed in a body bag and discovered by a medical student named Cassie(Krysten Ritter) who has dreams of turning his undeath into her ticket to money and fame in her medical profession.

Drex, once a loser and now one of the undead tries to return to a normal life after he's been dead. Yes he's returned from the life and has a hunger for brains. In fact the only thing that he CAN eat is brains without getting sick. Pretty much everyone who annoys him turns into a brain chewing fantasy in his mind. Aside from that there are no 'zombie' activities that happens. Drex gets super strength, heat vision, improved healing, and all kinds of random 'powers' with a strange man stalking him.

This is not your typical zombie film in any way shape or form. While Drex is technically a zombie he's an intelligent zombie (has been done) and can eat animal brains instead of humans (can be done.) It's not a horror film (even with a zombie) but unlike films like Fido which was also low on gore with a zombie as one of the center characters you can't exactly call it a comedy since it wasn't that funny. It was however interesting in that different type of film kind of way. It's not a comedy but has a lot of comedians, it's not a romantic comedy but it has Drex trying to get interested with Cassie, it's not a horror film though it does show Drex fantasizing about eating zombies. I'm not sure if I can suggest buying it but I would say renting would be a plus. The only part of it I could say is a 'problem' is that there is a HUGE cliffhanger at the end and we have no idea if there will be a sequel released. So sitting through it won't give you all of the answers, just a few.",1349049600,,2934,4.2060390763765545
8407220,2,B003VZ8JDQ,"I just rented this and I didn't hate it until the end. It's low budget but it has some charm which is why I gave it 2 stars.  The problem starts towards the end of the movie where you see that they are running out of time to wrap this up (and yes it slows to a crawl making you look at the time).  After 80 minutes you find out (since I'd never heard of WUD or Crackle) that this is a web-series of 4 minute episodes strung together ending in a cliffhanger.  Very disappointing.

As others have mentioned if you love zombies...and who doesn't, you will be let down.  If you like comedies, horror movies and/or a complete story...again you will be let down.  If they think I will visit Crackle weekly for the next season of 4 minute episodes...*they* will be let down.",1287792000,7,767,4.255172413793104
8407221,2,B003VZ8JDQ,Lame and boring.  Seemed to drag on forever.  There were a few entertaining scenes but overall I was amazed how boring this interesting sounding plot became.  It is done in reality tv form.  I love zombies but this blows.  A genuine let down.,1287532800,4,242,4.534883720930233
