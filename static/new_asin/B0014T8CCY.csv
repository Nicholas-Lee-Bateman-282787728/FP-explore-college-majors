8256262,4,B0014T8CCY,"Although this somber documentary, and considering it's subject matter it should be somber, lacks any great cinematic achievement, it still left me with tears running down my face because of the needless suffering of Francois and his family's devastation. I was even moved by the aunt of one of the skinhead perpetrators who knew the horrific circummstances underwhich her nephew was raised and caused this violent , homophobic act.

This is another reminder that we simply cannot allow the revisionist history of Nazi aplogists and their atrocities to fade away, because it still has consequences decades later on how we view and treat people who do not fit the standard mold. I congratulate the filmakers for keeping prejudice and intolerance in the consciousness of the new generations coming after us.",1425168000,2,804,5.184615384615385

8256264,1,B0014T8CCY,"It is incredibly easy to praise a documentary based entirely on the subject matter or story it covers, and it is done far too often. The crime against Francois Chenu in 2002 was horrific and tragic, but this is irrelevant when evaluating the quality of Beyond Hatred as a film. The first thing you notice upon watching this work is that the French love to smoke; there is hardly a scene with at least one person with a cigarette in hand, and Marlboro seems to be the brand of choice. The fact that I was noticing this pointless detail illustrates the sheer failure of this movie as a quality documentary. Olivier Meyrou spends 90 minutes explaining to the viewer that getting punched in the face hurts. Basically, the average human being understands that losing a son is tragic for the parents; losing a brother is tragic for the siblings; losing a family member to a violent crime scars you for life. These are things we do not need explained to us, and documentarians cheat by relying on this approach to pad their otherwise meaningless films. In the end, your learn nothing from watching Beyond Hatred. There is a 60 second scene of the victim's sister standing under a shower, inert and taciturn. What does this accomplish? Will the audience fail to grasp the tragedy she has experienced without this scene? There is no talent behind the making of this movie; even worse, there is no point to this movie besides the exploitation of a family's grief in the name of art. I actually like the style used here; I am not impressed by the pseudo journalism used in American melodramatic television tabloids, like Dateline and its cronies. But the minimalistic style cannot overcome the lack of skill by Meyrou. People fear criticizing these documentaries, lest they be accused of demeaning the subject matter, in this case a hate crime. Sadly, no bigger insult can be cast upon the issues than making irrelevant movies about them. Beyond Hatred is, simply put, beyond pointless.",1413072000,2,1975,4.777777777777778
8256265,4,B0014T8CCY,"The film is not at all typical of the portrayal of violence on American television or in most documentaries on related subjects.

It is a film about randomness and violence and the honest divide between event and comprehension.  It is a unique and refreshingly ""unsatisfying"" mapping of the hurt and the destruction a random act of terror causes.",1393027200,3,346,4.948275862068965
8256266,1,B0014T8CCY,"Highly recommended... for insomniacs. How a film could be this dull with such compelling subject matter is quite a feat. I quite literally fell asleep about a half hour into the proceedings and had to come back and finish it later. The first 30 minutes were so tedious I was itching to scan ahead. Lethargic non-direction filmed in ""classic verite style"" (bah!) is pretentious to say the least. Stationary camera focused on uninteresting people talking about uninteresting things doesn't always make an artistic statement. Family seems void of emotion, talking about the victim as if he were someone they had read about not someone related and at times it felt rehearsed, they do smoke a lot though. I've heard of forgive and forget but these are pod people - zombiefied! It's astounding this film boasts to be winner of Best Documentary at Berlin Film Festival and winner of Special Prize at Sarasota Film Festival. I award it the Grand Prize in ""How Not To Make a Crime Documentary"" for it excels in that category. I kept thinking how much better this would have been had a director like Errol Morris had a hand in it. Long passage of narrative with stationary camera which seem to be time lapsed are not understated but incredibly dull. In the hands of a master like Morris a whole new effect might be obtained. Seriously, I cannot believe the reviews on this thing... maybe we're talking about different films. Possibly the worse document about a crime and its aftermath I have ever seen. Give me Andy Warhol's ""Sleep"" or ""Empire"" next time I want to take a nap. And yes, the ad work and case are misleading on this; shots of folks just sitting around a table puffing on cigs would be more appropriate for the cover art.",1276732800,5,1724,4.693069306930693
8256267,1,B0014T8CCY,i bought this dvd thinking i would get to see something of the killers backgrounds but instead i got a boring viewpoint coming from the victims parents. i thought perhaps the court scene might do some justice but i got zilch. don't waste your money on this crap.,1264118400,5,262,4.479166666666667
