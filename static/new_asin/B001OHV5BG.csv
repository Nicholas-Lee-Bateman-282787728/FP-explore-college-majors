8330584,3,B001OHV5BG,"Deven Yuvvraaj (Salman Khan) is in love with Anushka (Katrina Kaif), but her father (Boman Irani) refuses to allow the match.  When Deven's estranged father dies leaving a fortune, Deven is sure that he will inherit and be able to marry Anushka.  However, his father disinherits both Deven and his younger brother Danny (Zayed Khan), in favor of their mentally challenged elder brother Gyanesh (Anil Kapoor).  Deven and Danny then become tentative partners in a game to scam Gyanesh out of the money.

In this family drama, the plot is mostly good, with uneven bits.  Both Khan's give credible, if not exceptional, performances.  Kapoor's performance is hindered by his part; his character is depicted as only very little resembling the autistic savant he is supposed to be, seeming at times to be fully functioning and at other times as challenged.  This really lessened Kapoor's sometimes strong performance, as well as the movie in general.  The songs are generally lovely, and the costumes--particularly in the musical numbers--are extravagant and impressive.  Overall, it's a visually pleasing film with a positive message, but only mediocre otherwise.",1512864000,,1157,5.278688524590164

8330588,5,B001OHV5BG,"I absolutely loved Yuvvraaj.  It was a complete departure from other SK movies that I have watched.  Visually, this movie was spectacular ;  shot on location in Austria.  The vistas were amazing.  The music was sublime - a  mix of classical, some very original Afro-Hindi rhythms, and contemporary arrangements and lyrics.  Choreography was fantastic with a nod to "" Cats"" in one number. The customs were on point ! Contemporary and fit the characters although there was this "" Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm outfit that Danny's ( the younger brother)girl friend wore - but other than that most outfits were elegant and stylish. and yes, there was the formal ball gown in the woods scene- but it was ok.

  I don't know if Salman K and Katrina K were a couple or on their way to being a couple but the chemistry between them was electric.  There is acting, and then there is that connectedness that transcends acting a role.  There was one scene where they were pillow fighting - there was a familiar energy between them in that scene. I saw the same energy in Ek Tha Tiger and they were not together then.

The storyline: 3 estranged brothers, father dies and leaves a will, the oldest brother is an autistic genius and gets the inheritance. Needless to say the other two brothers and the Uncle with his family were not happy and work to try and gain a share ( if not all) of the inheritance.  The story is very much like Rain Main only in my opinion, much better - Anil Kapoor was brilliant as Gyanesh the autistic musical genius, and Salman Khan as Deven one of his younger brothers.  You know, it's rare that you want to sit through another viewing of a Hindi movie - near three hours can be enough - but in the case of Yuvvraaj you want to watch it again.

The ending for some may be a bit flat- there isn't a grand "" we love each now forever - group hug "" ending but you do come to understand what the Father had to do, even from beyond the grave to get his family back together. Oh!  I loved the closing credits - a full musical number that included not only cast but everyone who worked on the movie - it was a great show of appreciation and support - I loved it.  This movie has everything, Scenes that make you laugh out loud, cry and weep, get angry, and any other emotions you want to add...it's definitely a keeper !",1359676800,,2325,4.354988399071925
8330589,5,B001OHV5BG,"If I listened to the critics, I would have missed out on a great movie.  Classical music in a Bollywood production definitely works here! A good buy.",1320883200,,149,4.518518518518518
8330590,1,B001OHV5BG,"The version of the movie Yuvvraaj that I bought turned out not to be an original copy as advertised. This movie turned out to be 24 minutes shorter than the original released DVD. Major scenes were edited out of the movie, and what was left was a seriously butchered version.

I have a copy of the original released DVD, and it is 180 minutes long, and quite entertaining. Salman Khan did a great job portraying the dislikable character, Deven. He redeems himself before the movie ends, but without the missing scenes, the movie really falls flat.

I advise anyone to not purchase the shortened and edited version of Yuvvraaj, because now it is a waste of time. Instead of returning the movie, I tossed it in the waste bin.",1318291200,,723,4.596899224806202
8330591,2,B001OHV5BG,"The movie has been made in Europe. It has good locales. There is evidence of fine taste for paintings. A. R. Rehman's music is good, but not great.  Anil Kapoor comes out as competent. The story is quite thin and the narration is unexciting. Boman Irani gives an entertaining performance. Zayed Khan, Salman Khan, Katrina Kaif et al, disappoint.

The story is about a rich father in London who dictates to his friend and Attorney (Mithun Chakrobarty) how to play out his Will. There are millions in the estate. The ultimate aim is to bring about strong brotherhood among his 3 children from 2 marriages. There is a scheming ""Mama"" (Uncle). And, there is a very little boy. There is a talented singer who has severe asthma.

Increasingly, numerology is dictating the spelling of movie titles. However, the story is thin and the movie falls flat, although Subhash Ghai has directed and made this movie.",1297728000,,900,4.7935483870967746
8330592,4,B001OHV5BG,"This movie had so much potential. It is filmed in grand and glossy style in Austria and some scenes are a visual feast. They have some really good dance sequences (including one somewhat more doubtful one danced for some reason in costumes from Lloyd Webber's 'Cats')
The overwhelming plus for me is the music. I found I liked almost all of it and it memorable and interesting. It is by Golden Globe (and potentially Oscar winning as I write) soundtrack winner A.R. Rahman. This one is easily equal to the Slumdog Millionaire soundtrack. In fact if you like your music with full orchestra, rather than electronica, you'll like this even more. I really loved the music in this and it stands out on the horizon for this.
Now the plot is quite a good one. We have 3 brothers, sons of a London millionaire. One brother (Salmon Khan) is estranged from the family and hates his autistic older brother whom his father favoured. Then there is the autistic brother with a musical gift (Anil Kapoor), and a dissolute, callous, gambling younger brother (Zayed Khan) who bullies the autistic one and is also jealous of him. Father dies and leaves all his estate to the autistic one. Salmon's character wants to marry his girlfriend (played by his real life girlfriend Katrina Kaif) but her wealthy father won't let her marry someone who is penniless. So the 2 slighted brothers connive to get their share of the estate. However they increasingly get drawn into the loving simplicity of their musical autistic brother who finds his place in the world of music and helps them find their connection as brothers.
Now the problem. A lot of the acting particularly in the first half was dodgy. Salmon's character was quite unlikeable, Katrina and Zayed seemed awkward and the girls father (Boman Irani) needed reining in as he was way over the top (though looked good for the part and could have done what was required). There were also some caricatured relatives that were there more as symbols that flesh and blood. I wondered if Salmon was just miscast (a musclebound musician??) Interestingly he seemed to be playing some of the dynamics with Katrina's character that they are purporting to be battling with in real-life over a decision over whether to marry (though not for lack of wealth!) One hopes he isn't as dismissive of her in reality as he plays here.
I wasn't sure how Anil was coping with the autistic part initially but he really settled into it and stood out as doing a good job. Sikandar Mirza as the lawyer was quite good too though his part was small.
Anyway most of them settled down enough (or I adapted) that I could also settle down and enjoy the visuals and that superb music.
The acting in this movie disappointed a lot of people I gather and it didn't do well at the box office. Many people don't seem to like Salmon, and a lot of others don't like Katrina in reviews I read before I saw it. However if you avoided the movie for this you would have missed the redeeming features of the music and visuals.
The acting dragged it down from the 5 it could so easily have been with different casting and restrained acting. I have to boost it up to the 4 though in view of the sumptuous visuals and that music.",1232755200,5,3213,4.599303135888502
