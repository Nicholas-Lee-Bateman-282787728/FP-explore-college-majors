8145617,3,B000IHYXQW,"Not a bad movie, kind of average.
There are some funny moments and some decent shot making, based around 3 cushion carom instead of pool makes a change but the story wavers a bit from time to time.
There is a nice twist at the end....",1253232000,,234,4.108695652173913
8145618,4,B000IHYXQW,"This film begins with the history about how pool was invented. ""El Vago"" (Daniel Martinez) wins a pool bar to ""El Mexicano"" (Jesus Ochoa) on a bet in the same game. Viewing the game as a matter of honor, El Vago is determined to keep the place and make of it the most respectful place in town. Not knowing much about business matters, he decides to hire ""El Perro"" (Diego Luna) as the manager of the place. After realizing that in order to re-model a pool bar it takes a lot of money, without mentioning employees' salaries and other expenses, El Mexicano offers to help him by lending some money. At first El Vago refuses since he knows perfectly well El Mexicano's method of collecting (beating, breaking knees, taking your possesions, all the good stuff), but accepts when El Mexicano proposes that if El Vago can't pay, he will simply get his pool bar back. Once the business is running, he finds out he is being robbed by El Perro, that some people don't pay their time for the tables, so he decides to make an instructional video about pool, he has special guest appearances, like ""El Campeon"" who was the owner of several pools and even played with Presidents from different countries, not leaving aside that he appears in the Guiness Book of World Records; he even organizes a tournament and does as much as he can in order to make money and keep his place. Great performances, love, action, drama, comedy and real-life situations, I really reccomend this to all those who want to know how businesses and lives are runned and controled in Mexico as of today...",1188604800,4,1568,4.603571428571429
