772813,4,6303982956,"This was based in a true story about a man who because of this incident became a member of the San Francisco community that worked unselfishly for sports, community and people in general.  Though that came later it was nice to see the formative years of him done so well.  For those who do not know roller derby the final scene where the rookie is helped by Mickey Rooney was played as an extra by the soon to be Legend of Roller Derby Charlie O'Connell as Omar.  This is a real nostalgia film and enjoyable by all ages.",1377129600,,520,4.285714285714286

772815,3,6303982956,"If you like roller skating, then this is for you. I bought it because Marilyn Monroe is in it in a small part and I collect all of Marilyn's movies. Rooney plays Rooney. Nothing special about this one.",1372464000,,201,4.315789473684211

772817,3,6303982956,"It's a chapter to add to your Marilyn Monroe collection if you're an avid fan but, she's doesn't have a big part and she tries to use her deep voice as with earlier films. The story is simplistic. Good if you're into roller derby and the history of it because you can see how it was done in the 1940's. It's typical Mickey Rooney wayward boy who learns how to be a better person after a few life lessons. It's O.K.",1362787200,,414,4.1234567901234565
772818,4,6303982956,"One of the better movies with Mickey. It was the movie I learned to ""hate"" Mickey. When an actor can make you either Love or hate a character,
they are better, then just good actors.
I am of the era, where I grew up with Mickey Rooney. From the Hardy Boys, to Black Beauty,(? or was it My Friend Flicka? (?)) to The FireBall,
to his classic war movies.
Starred with Judy,and Elizabeth.
Married to some of the glamorous ladies in Hollywood.
This""little big Man"" did it all.",1362268800,,472,4.375
772819,5,6303982956,"This film shows the talent and energy that Mickey Rooney has displayed for many decades.  At the time that it was produced, Rooney's career was somewhere ""in the middle,"" and he was fighting to regain his top star status.  As Mickey has proven time and again, ""you can't keep a good man down,"" and he rises to the very apex of success with his performance in this motion picture.  At one time, I was his greatest fan, and even changed my first name to ""Mickey"" during my teenage years.  Having been a professional actor for fifty-five years, I realize how much I learned from The Mighty Mick just by viewing his films on television.  ""The Fireball"" is one of his finest.  Don't miss this one!  ... BURR MIDDLETON (Formerly child actor Mickey Hoyle).",1032998400,5,749,4.586466165413534
772820,5,6303982956,"I am responding to the review by Donna. My name is Bob Chester and I have information reguarding the movie Fireball. My father, Mickey Chester, was a teammate of the person in which the movie was made about. Johnny Gazar was who the movie was about, and my father showed Mickey Rooney how to skate in the 30's at the skatebowl behind Gramons Chinese Rest. If you want more information, drop me and email. I have pictures of the team members. Thanks for your interest, I had been looking for people who were interested in this for years. Thank you.",1018828800,4,547,4.48
772821,5,6303982956,"Anyone who is able to get there hands on this fantastic Movie showing the comedy and energy that we all love so much in Mickey Rooney.  Who ever taught him to skate must have been a pro. This movie is differant than the other movies that I have loved thourgh the years with our guy Micky.
If anyone knows who else was involved in the movie i.e. the technical work etc. and The Skate Instructor Please let us know.  More people need to know about this wonderful adventure of a movie.
Enjoy

7860667,5,6303982956,The Fireball was shown on television in 1950's and that was how I introduced to Mickey Rooney and his films. The Fireball is very entertaining to me as always.,1426896000,,159,4.517241379310345

7860670,4,6303982956,"A quaint 1950s movie about a kid (Mickey Rooney) that is destined for bad times ahead. Eventually, he gets himself together and finds a hobby, of sorts. He finds a pair of roller skates and begins to like them. He enlists the help of local ""skating teachers"" at a nearby skating rink. He's not too sure at first, but in time he learns and enters a skating rink race. He gets good, so good that he tries to out due the current champion and gets a big head in the process.
I liked this movie as a whole and I think he did a great job with the script he was given. You will also see a young Marilyn Monroe, in her 8th movie appearance. She had a few lines and looked ravishing ""stealing"" every scene she was in. If you like Mickey Rooney, Marilyn Monroe and black and white movies, than this one is for you.
Sidenote ~ if you have a DVD/VCR recorder, this will dupe to DVD a perfect copy! You will not have to pay for a DVD, you can make one that looks good on your own.",1416182400,3,967,4.041666666666667
7860671,5,6303982956,"This movie was great to watch again.  I remembered it from the fifties when it appeared on TV.  There were some funny spots like the guy that was roller dancing.  Micky, I am sure, did some tongue in cheek acting here and there.  The premise was a bit corny but that gives this movie a feeling of being more real than today's bill o fare of overused cgi.  My wife liked it also and she generally doe's not like b and w movies especially old b and w movies.  You won't find this one on you tube, someone owns the rights, so buy it and have a good time watching it while eating some pop corn while watching a bit of corn.",1403049600,,619,4.032786885245901
7860672,5,6303982956,"Based on a true story The Fireball is a real treat for those who fondly remember the hokey melodrama of the banked track that was roller derby. Mickey Rooney shines as a self important hot shot that burns up the tracks and adds drama to the game. He is sometimes his own worst enemy but the thing you have to admire most about the character is that he never quits. No matter what life seems to throw at him Mickey finds away to overcome it. He is often brash and abrasively rude but you can't help wanting to see him succeed. When he finally skates his way to the top, alienating everyone ever close to him in the process, he is struck down by crippling polio. But he is unstoppable!  He struggles his way back to the banked track and, we trust, acquires a bit more humble view of himself and life. Marylin Monroe has a small part.",1396742400,2,831,4.2594936708860756
