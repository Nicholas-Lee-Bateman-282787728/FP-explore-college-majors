3941557,3,B002KLALEC,"In this documentary by Gary Hustwit, industrial design is examined. It explains the thought processes behind why consumer goods are made the way they are by experts in the industry.

The film inconsistently held my attention. Some explanations seemed rather shallow and vague, and many scenes felt like they were stretched too long. Also, it seemed to lack a understandable flow: most scenes felt random because they lacked transitions. His previous work, Helvetica, had the same problems but not to the same degree.

Nonetheless, Hustwit's documentary was a real eye-opener and a real thought-provoker. The interviewees uncover the facade of consumerism to show the processes behind designing products and marketing products. As a design enthusiast, I found myself pondering such topics as minimalism and feature bloat, topics touched on during the film.

It's not interesting enough that I'd watch it again, but I definitely recommend. You will never shop the same way.",1262304000,3,971,5.375

3941560,3,B002KLALEC,"Hearing Jonathan Ive muse about Apple's design and manufacturing process was alone worth the price of the movie, but overall was disappointed in the choice of interviews, lack of continuity,  or lack of story arc. It's not a movie about the history of product design, the future of product design, or this past year's most compelling examples. It's not even about how products are conceived for a purpose, marketed, and consumed. (with a few exceptions including the Smart Design piece)

Product design fills a vital need in everyday life. On a good day, product design saves lives. Unfortunately on this day product design stared at it's navel, waxed philosophically, and wore white nail polish. This movie focuses a lot of time on egomaniacs that design things that only 5% of the population can afford. Yawn. And the one ""critic"" was exhumed from early 20-century Soviet Union -- and smugly towed the party line all too predictably.

The last 1/3 of the movie was especially disappointing in that it dragged out trying to answer philosophical questions that no one was asking. I was especially perplexed by the couple that designed ""products"" for a museum and defended their contributing to society because so many people visit museums...I'm still scratching my head.

IDEO was well represented, but missing was their case studies about redesigning Emergency Rooms and other vital and relevant challenges... just more well formed philosophy and an ancient laptop no one ever used.

And if I feel like there was point to me made, it not only dragged it out, but then didn't actually make it - just a  ""designers are responsible for the stuff that ends up in a land fill."" But is that what product design is about? I hardly think so, and feel its irresponsible to leave us thinking that's the last known trajectory for product design - more crap people ""get duped"" into buying, then throw it out. Give me a break.

Dieter Rams, the Smart Design team, and other bits and pieces, like Ive's intro voice over, are highlights, but I'd estimate half the movie was filled with dead end or esoteric vignettes or egomaniacs that seem to thrive on perpetuating unproductive and self-service cliches about designers.

In the end, this movie is not about the past, present or future of product design. It mashes together tiny bits from all over and unfortunately their ""mixed tape"" approach falls flat and is only partially inspiring.

This movie perpetuates the tired fact that Design, in general, has an enormous chip on it's shoulder, and is still struggling with their identity in the ""real world.""
I wasn't left inspired that product design can help create countermeasures to great challenges. Instead I was left thinking design just a means to charge more for new things that ultimately end up in landfills, including this movie.",1260403200,17,2825,4.943037974683544
3941561,5,B002KLALEC,"The interviews from all the designers are very in depth, I would recommend this to any design, art, or cad student for sure! I love how they go all over the world for design input rather than focusing on one place like Cali or Europe. A lot of focus on electronics and furniture but they get the point across. I actually liked this one more than Helvetica, mostly because you don't have any of the biases for or against something, its all about design process and hands-on thinking.

3941591,3,B002KLALEC,"The subject seemed interesting and I was hopeful that it would be an interesting look into the product design process. Ironically, this seemed to be much more of a subjective video, in which designers talked mainly about themselves.

The speakers might be great designers, but they're not good communicators at all. They seem unable to explain complex ideas in language that can be understood by someone who doesn't already know what they mean.  Their discussion is vague and peppered with oblique references they never bother to explain.  It left me with the distinct impression that they live in a rarefied world where everyone seems to be on the same page. After the tenth ""you know,"" I wanted to say ""No, I don't know. Why don't you tell us?""

I don't want to give the impression that it was all bad. It had its interesting moments, especially when someone was talking about something historical.  This DVD might be very interesting to people who already understand product design, or to fans wanting to learn about the featured designers, but it wasn't very illuminating and I don't think it would be very interesting for outsiders.",1411084800,,1137,4.901041666666667
3941602,5,B002KLALEC,"This was a inspiring film, I am shocked that I didn't see it sooner.

I think every designer of all mediums should own this. This is the type of film that can be watched over and over again and find new inspirations each time. I actually rented this and now I am going to buy it. (I do not have a huge dvd collection, but what I do own are amazing films)",1407628800,,354,3.9166666666666665
3941603,2,B002KLALEC,"I watched this the other day, thinking, ""Oh, yeah, that documentary I started watching but never finished."" Only to discover that I had, in fact, watched the whole thing before, and had forgotten 90% of it. This is a work you *want* to like, but in the end it feels... insubstantial. Pointless. There's no meat on these bones, no material here. This film actually lessened my appreciation for some of the designers interviewed, many of whom seemed lost in their own estimation of the value of their work and their field. The contrast is humorous, actually one interviewee talks about designers replacing philosophers as the guiding thinkers of society, closely followed by another who points out that the vast majority of modern design goes into the creation of new consumer-culture ""junk"". And I almost rolled my eyes clean out of my head hearing designers talk about the 'white man's burden' upon them to improve the world for the rest of us.

The main lessons I gleaned from this film had to do with marketing, with selling 'shinys' and 'sexys' to first-world consumers. I learned how designers who fancy themselves would like to be perceived. I remain curious about the meat-and-potatoes of design, and I kept waiting for the celebrity parade to end. This film somehow fails to be much about design, art, philosophy or really anything.

3941624,5,B002KLALEC,"There are a few overused film gimmicks and awkwardly strung together scenes (but it's a documentary, they have to work with what the interviewees give them). There are also a couple strange scenes involving the designers talking about themselves at length that don't immediately seem to advance the point of the film, but they do give the viewer an insight into the kind of people who do design work, and I suspect that the film maker's believed actual designers watching the film would enjoy getting a sneak peak into the thought processes and personalities of some of these famous designers.
As an aspiring designer, this was a great introduction that gave a nice, but also, as it seems, basic overview of the design process. I enjoyed it and would recommended it for other beginners like me!",1344211200,,794,4.845588235294118

They spent too much time dwelling on apple products and talking with people who just seemed unintelligent. There were a few great points, but the message that the producers wanted to get across wasn't clear.

3941628,4,B002KLALEC,"This film tries to answer the question, ""What is industrial design and what is our relationship with it?"" The task is far too ambitious. The result is a fascinating survey of contemporary design and designers that does not conclude or point to an answer to the question, but merely ends. Nevertheless, Hustwit interviews his subjects well and keeps things brisk, but also provides satisfying depth now and then. Anyone interested in the art and design will enjoy this film.

However, Objectified compares unfavorably with Hustwit's excellent documentary on the typeface&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Helvetica/dp/B000VWEFP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Helvetica</a>. The film Helvetica explores the history and impact of one typeface. While doing so, it peers deeply into the nature of visible language, how we shape it and how it shapes us. Helvetica is a gem of a film. If Hustwit had made Objectifed following the model of Helvetica, it would have focused on, say, the nature of chairs, or maybe on particularly successful chair design, or something like that. The flaw in Objectified is the over-ambitious breadth of its topic. Its saving grace is Hustwit's deft ability as an interviewer and editor.",1314835200,2,1248,5.709677419354839
3941629,3,B002KLALEC,"Objectified is an odd beast.  It's too niche for the average person, yet it's not informative enough for experienced designers.  Objectified falls into that category of ""introductions to a subject that only people already in it will care about.""  Also, being about designers, it has moments of intense navel gazing.  One designer makes a particularly floaty claim about how government policy makers will turn to designers for truth.

There is also a section in the middle about the ""greening"" of design, which feels forced and out of place.  It is wedged in there to hit a particular demographic checkbox.  And there is a *lot* of shots of people on the street using their cellphones in slow motion.  By the end, this technique has long since degraded into cornball.

That is not to say that Objectified is without value.  If you know who Dieter Rams is, you might get a kick out of seeing him trim his bonzai.  You might enjoy watching Jonathan Ives wipe shmutz off of his iPhone screen, or hear people talk about the birth of User Interface design.  Don't expect any actual information about User Interface design, or design in general.  The enthusiasm that some of these designers bring to the table is infectious.  And their perspectives on design, while classic archetypes, have been useful reviews to stay on message with.

But what Objectified brings to the table is not rocket science.  It is a basic, but solid 1st-year introduction to the world of industrial design.",1310860800,24,1476,4.867469879518072
3941630,1,B002KLALEC,"Saw this the night after I watched Helvetica. If you are like me and incredibly interested in industrial design- as it pertains to the user and the environment- this will leave you disappointed. I've read books by Bruno Munari and George Nelson, seen exhibits on streamline design and studied the tenets of Dieter Rams...and this film didn't come close to any of those experiences. It didn't go over manufacturing, the challenges, the history- anything of interest. It was 75 minutes of mostly younger designers talking about themselves and their own importance. Dieter Rams got maybe 5 minutes of screen time and the Eames got mentioned once. No discussion of Danish design or Mid Century Italian work. Just an incomplete thought...a perfect metaphor for today's modern ""designers.""

3941647,2,B002KLALEC,"I was quite interested in the topic of the movie, especially since it promised to explore our interactions with objects in the world. Even the title suggested that it might consider not just the ways that humans transform their environments through design, but the ways that those objects transform our sense of what it is to be human, in the process (perhaps) objectifying us. Instead what this movie offers is a wholly uncritical celebration of design and designers, which culminates in the claim by one designer that they deserve the status formerly accorded philosophers (and, presumably, megalomaniac architects like Corbusier).

I don't really blame the designers for their bombast, but I do blame the filmmakers for their inability or unwillingness to probe beneath these claims and to ask hard questions about the relationship between design, capitalism, and the lives of ordinary folks. There are a couple of gestures toward the environmental impact of all our goodies, but these don't go anywhere. For that matter, neither does the movie. If you watch the first 10 minutes and nothing else you will already have taken in the basic point of the movie, which is to tell you how cool design is, how cool designers are, and how much we should be grateful to them for the sleek functionality of our MacBook Pros (though I would have thought $1700 would be gratitude enough).",1283644800,31,1379,4.995652173913044

3941649,4,B002KLALEC,"I enjoyed this movie but, it did not feel as tight as Helvetica. I think a slightly different direction in filmmaking and editing was needed. It felt slow and ponderous at times. Maybe it was the subject - limited to commercial product design? Just not enough juicy material to bite into. Maybe industrial design is too young, too commercial, too much built to meet the buyer's needs - despite any radical concepts or methodologies that emerge?
I would like to have seen more 20th C. history. Joe Columbo, AEG: Peter Behrens (the worlds first industrial designer and first to create and use all types of design at a corporation in a consistent manner), Buckminster Fuller (maybe), 1920s American design, Raymond Lowey, etc..

3941650,4,B002KLALEC,"I saw this documental three times. I also played it in my user centered design class. It's great material for educative purposes, but for first or second semester design students, and particularly the design process at Smart Design and IDEO. I do personally empatize with the way design is done at those two firms. Dieter Rams interview is great. Although it shows the state of affairs and different points of view, it's scope is too narrow, mostly focusing in well known designers, curators, critics and studios from the US, Europe and only one from Asia (N. Fukasawa) Design book publishers (Phaidon) started to realize that there is a lot of good design activity beyond the U.S. , Europe and Japan. I't would be great to see a second part showing the work of Filipino, Brazilian, Kenian or Mexican designers or small design consultancies in emerging countries who have to apply a lot of creativity, obtaining great designs in cultures with less corporation oriented design philosopies, and more technology limited environments. I do agree partially with ""JW's"" review, Most of this people are involved with a small fraction of the produced goods in the world but it does generally sample the way many design professionals do their work.

There is a lot, of course, that's not directly relevant to us - they're talking primarily about physical things: the personality of the chair you sit in, the comfort of the gardening shears in your hand, the aesthetics of cars - but there's so much that really is very relevant. Personality and aesthetic of anything even if it's strictly visual/digital, function, user emotional reaction and even attachment, the subconscious message embedded in the shape or color or texture of a thing.
