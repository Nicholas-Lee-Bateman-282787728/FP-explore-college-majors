4520787,4,B00519BOV4,I did enjoy watching this movie.  I have not read the book so I don't know how it compares.  I enjoyed watching it because the family of the victim got justice for the one who was killed.,1371772800,,187,4.027027027027027

4520789,1,B00519BOV4,I loved the book but I thought the TV movie was awful. The casting was way off too. I also did not mind that the DVD that I purchased broke halfway through the movie and would not play. I recommend the book but don't waste your money on the DVD.,1356825600,5,245,3.92
4520790,5,B00519BOV4,"Outstanding movie based on true events. Ally Sheedy is great as Jane a woman who devotes 13 years bringing her aunts killer to justice. Sean Patrick Flanery is perfectly cast as Jane's long time friend turned lover. Handsome, charming and totally convincing as Tom O'Donnell. Meat Loaf is the surprisingly effective casting choice for Jack Morris, the cold case detective that never gives up. I was riveted watching this movie and the coming to terms that such a good looking, seemingly moral man might not be what he seems to be.",1316044800,26,530,4.835164835164835

4520799,5,B00519BOV4,"The actual crime was much more vicious than portrayed in the movie.  Incredibly sad subject, but the movie very adeptly uncovered evidence piece by piece, building to the solid conclusion of guilt for Tom ODonnell.

4520803,2,B00519BOV4,"The only reason it got two stars is Meat Loaf's competent acting.  But Ally Sheedy's work definitely earned one star.  Her idea of acting seems to consist of jabbing her very aggressive chin at people, talking through clenched teeth, and grabbing at people with her claw-like hands.  She made this excruciating to watch.  And to listen to since she seemed to have a bad case of dry mouth through the whole filming.  What a horrid movie.

Read the book instead - it's much better and there's no Ally Sheedy at all.",1471996800,,513,4.582417582417582

4520807,1,B00519BOV4,I'm ashamed to admit I watched a good 20 minutes of this  before I realized that it was not the movie or tv show actually I thought I was sitting down to watch. I made it through about 20 minutes before I realized it and then promptly cut it off as I can never get that time back! Something happened to Sean Patrick Flannerys face to the point he is  unrecognizable.  I'm not trying to be mean or nasty it's just that it was bothersome because I couldn't figure out who it was at first.  Ally Sheedy looks anorexic and it's sad because she's not a bad actress.

So, it was entertaining.. enough.  DecenI story, but it was quite predictable. It held my attention . And I didn't feel like I waisted my time. I watch many movies because a big celebrity is in it. The acting will be goof but I watch and I wait and wait thinking that the story must get better. Then it doesn't get any better and leaves you hanging at the end.  Then I think ""wow! I just wasted 2 hours on that?"" Anyways, the acting in this movie is definitely not good.  Ally Sheafy.. I don't want to put anyone in a box and say they should only play in a particular type of role, but I do feel that she should probably play in more age appropriate roles.

When I saw that the overall review rating for the movie was only 3.5 stars, I almost passed this movie up.  But I figured it would be something to play in the background while I did housework.  Now the movie's over and the housework never got started (yeah, yeah . . . I'm gonna do it now).

The story moves along at a very good pace, with Jane & the aunt's close relationship covered thoroughly, but swiftly.  Within a very short time after the opening, the murder has taken place and the story takes off.  The entire cast does an excellent job, however Ally Sheedy and Meat Loaf Aday are particularly fine.  I did not recognize Mr. Aday, and did not realize how good an actor he is.

Although I had read the film blurb, as the story progressed I forgot that this was actually based on a true homicide.  When the wrap up came, with end notes on the main characters, I was surprised.  But I think that only goes to show how absorbing I found this movie, yet how entertaining it was in the sense that it drew me right into the plot.  Also, for any fan of San Francisco, some of the scenery and atmosphere shots are lovely.

It's worth doing a quick Google search on Jane Alexander.  While Ally Sheedy looks to be in her 40's in the movie, Ms. Alexander was actually 61 when her 88 year old aunt was murdered . . . and murdered much more gruesomely than is portrayed in the film.  So she was 74 by the time she was able to put together enough of a case with the help of a detective, to prove the identity of the murderer.  And she also began Citizens Against Homicide at around that same time.  Now I want to read the book by James Dalessandro!",1466467200,,1866,4.155988857938719

4520894,5,B00519BOV4,"At first I was going to pass it by but it was a true story and had Ally Sheedy and Meatloaf, both are great and rarely in a movie. They were wonderful in this as well. While I guessed it pretty quickly, the pacing of the investigation was done so well by Director & editor that I didn't find myself getting up & doing chores while it was playing! Guessing it & proving it are two different things. The work that Jane did on her own was remarkable. She was really the only one who could help in many ways. She also could put seemingly unrelated evidence together for the same reason. The script was good as there was a lot of real information and a book to inspire it.  As she showed how much she needed to get to the bottom of things, the detective took it more seriously and it saved her life. Had it just been left as a cold case, as many DA's refused to prosecute, there would not have been the publicity  that unearthed important evidence from people who would not normally have thought they had any information when the case was new.  It was wonderful to read at the end that she went on to help others, solving 20 cold cases before her passing. The message here is that one really has to be their own advocate.  What happened to her, as part of what was wrong, is not that unusual as a trusting person. That message was pretty clear too. With no statute of limitations, the right to a speedy trial doesn't start until the person is arrested. Though evidence grows cold, with more time there is a chance of finding more information not available when pressed for time, witnesses can also die. So it's a gamble. They can video tape a deposition of a witness who may be elderly or ill while investigating. All in all a good example of a good story.",1465084800,6,1751,4.280966767371601

The defense rests. To those that didn't like it I suggest they go back to watching cities getting blown up and watching stupid plots. They don't understand anything else.

I'd seen Sheedy in several movies when she was younger, and while she's aged in unexpected ways, her acting has blossomed into energetic succinct portrayals of her charge--in this case the true character of Jane Alexander. Meat Loaf's acting was so subtle and bewitching that I found myself wanting to take screen shots of his face wherein his expressions were feats of acting with each nuance of mood and inner thoughts flashing over his features.

8452473,5,B00519BOV4,"Used to love me some Ally Sheedy; but she's been gone so long. Anyway, the start had my gut check, 80's music on the streets of SF. Yikes. 6 minutes in I was contemplating a new venue. Made for TV movie almost did it in.  yada yada, at the 10 minute left mark, Meatloaf got the mystery envelope. The smoking gun. dun dun dun!!! The way they played this out had me objecting in court and wanting the man hung by myself. Very involved and the script was good and the actors did great in their parts. Meatloaf was the turd Det but turned when he saw the light. How come the DA is always on the wrong side? Sheedy battled that defense lawyer like a pro. I was proud. There's no good movie like one with a good ending. And then they put the notes at the end had me in tears. Good job, Jane.",1526601600,,785,4.032051282051282

8452475,5,B00519BOV4,"I loved every minute of this true crime account. All of the character Actors nailed their parts. It was well played and had a great flow. I am delighted to know this horrible crime was avenged and justice was served. In my opinion Jane Alexander was pivotal in showing the public that working with Law Enforcement does pay off. I do think it is sad that people kill for money after bad financial choices are made and innocent people have to pay as well as single females and widows are prey for Conmen. I am not happy that the picture for this movie was a ripoff of the Sharon Stone movie showing a female sitting in this position and I stayed away from viewing this movie because of it, as well as the bad reviews. That just shows we should listen to our intuition. I learned a lot from this movie. Ally Sheedy is great in this part as well as the Great Meat Loaf. If you enjoy watching justice get served, true crime and mysteries: You will enjoy this enactment. Enjoy!!!",1512950400,,973,4.351648351648351
8452476,2,B00519BOV4,"No, sorry.  Not five stars.  At least not for a feature movie.  Maybe if this were a made for tv, movie of the week, but otherwise, it really falls short.

The dialog is forced, terrible.  Though somewhat amusing, nearly every phone call is punctuated with a super dramatic single sentence, they immediately hang up on the other person.

If you have nothing better to do, I guess, try this.  I made it through all but the last 10 minutes, when the ""plot twist"" was revealed.",1509494400,,474,4.5058823529411764
8452477,3,B00519BOV4,"ok but pooooooooor acting throughout, especially Ally Sheedy.  Not convinced in any of her emotions; anger, greif, fear, joy, etc.  One viewing of this was quite enough.",1507420800,,169,5.222222222222222
8452478,2,B00519BOV4,"I gave this film 2 stars, because I halfway liked Ally Sheedy, in her acting performance.  It's a true story and usually I like true stories, but this one, for me was a bust.  It had potential to be a really great movie, but it was a fail.  It felt like to me, the actors were reading from a script, because like another reviewer said, their performances were wooden.  There was no clue that Jane Alexander had worked for 13 years to bring a killer to justice. There was no sense of time, or build up to her discoveries about the Man She believed She was in love with.  The movie, in my opinion, was a flat liner, all the way through, although I did enjoy seeing San Fran Bay, and all the beautiful scenery.",1495411200,2,707,4.207407407407407
8452479,1,B00519BOV4,"Reviews are really important in determining what I buy, watch ect. I don't write this to be negative but hope to help others.

This movie is not good in the slightest.  I really have a hard time understanding why it has such a high rating.

Dialogue: Wooden, some phrases are used multiple times
Scenes: Start too soon and sag
Character development: Outside the protagonist, everyone pops in and out to serve the plot and has no real depth
Music: Sounds like stock music from 1999

Biggest problem: lack of tension.  Until the very end, there is no really consequence to any of the action.

Making a bad movie is really hard.  I have been apart of a few films and even the worst one was a huge undertaking.  However, let's not call something of such poor quality good.",1494288000,2,768,4.5144927536231885
