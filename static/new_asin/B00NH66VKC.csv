That's I guess what youtube is for. I plan to listen to this set over and over for the rest of my life, and will enjoy comparing it with other cycles of this ""new testament"" for the piano.",1422748800,,332,4.045454545454546
8678181,5,B00NH66VKC,"This is the set of the sonatas made by Barenboim at the peak of his pianistic powers and recorded after the earlier set recorded by EMI for LP/CD and before the last set, also recorded by EMI but for Blu-ray and DVD. This review set was made in 1983-4 by Metropolitan Munich on 35mm film. That recording process gave better raw material than video tape of the period and the result of the restoration with the aid of modern techniques makes for a superior technical product within the context of its archive status.

This is the set of the sonatas made by Barenboim at the peak of his pianistic powers and recorded after the earlier set recorded by EMI for LP/CD and before the last set, also recorded by EMI but for Blu-ray and DVD. This review set was made in 1983-4 by Metropolitan Munich on 35mm film. That recording process gave better raw material than video tape of the period and the result of the restoration with the aid of modern techniques makes for a superior technical product within the context of its archive status.

The new 2014 re-issue of the Metropolitan Munich DVD set, previously issued as separate discs in 2013, is now re-issued as a box set and at a more tempting price. It is a shame that the Blu-ray edition bonus film/interview from 2012 in which Barenboim explains in detail the concepts lying behind this entire presentation is not included in this DVD box. This bonus film was previously only available on the Blu-ray set and its focus is briefly summarised in the following section.
.....................................

Presentational considerations:

The set is notable for the considerable input of Barenboim's views and intentions as regards the presentation of the music. This is fully explored in the Blu-ray bonus film as follows: In the interview Barenboim describes how he was approached to record these sonatas as a non-profit making venture by the film maker. This project was undertaken as a result of Barenboim being able to choose his musical director - someone whom he could trust to convey the STRUCTURE of the developing musical ideas visually but specifically NOT BY CONCENTRATING ON FINGER WORK.

Given that the recording was to take place in various palace rooms and that the finger work was not to be the main focus, the main filming emphasis would be to concentrate on the rooms, the objects in the rooms, camera angles and perspectives combined with the use of lighting effects to attempt to show the changes in structure and emotional temperature as they developed.

......................................

Technical considerations:

Technically the presentation was limited by the nature of film whereby the fast `ISO' speeds available to modern digital cameras was simply not available. Thus fast finger-work in the lighting circumstances of the venues would be beyond the technical capabilities of the film stock available at that time (1980-1983). This is evident when the fingers become a blur of movement. Furthermore, the only ways available to minimise this problem, would be to focus on the general view of the pianist playing as if a member of the audience, or to focus in tight with next to no depth of field - hence one hand at a time being markedly out of focus. Some historical perspective is required to understand this technical situation as well as an understanding of Barenboim's intent.

In summary, the restoration of this film stock has been meticulously done and has achieved results that are close to remarkable. Both image and sound are very consistent given the use of four separate palace locations in Vienna with differing acoustics and lighting. The imaging is clear and well lit whenever there is sufficient ambient light which is most of the time. The sound is well focussed with good depth of sound-stage and gives realistic definition. In short, this set delivers a good reproduction of piano sound and is certainly capable of giving sonic satisfaction comparable with good CDs of the same period, the early 1980s.  It is certainly not a cause for concern especially given its historical situation.

.................................

The music and its delivery: An over-view.

A big bonus with this set is being able to listen to the series chronologically. This is a considerable difference to the way some other sets have been compiled on CD for example.

This enables the listener to easily follow the broad developments occurring during the three recognised periods in Beethoven's life and even to detect far more subtle changes almost movement by movement. In particular there is the extraordinary development of emotional thought within the slow movements which become increasingly more complex in structure as Barenboim wanted to show visually via the film. At the same time there is an increasing breakdown and replacement of the 18th century model of the piano sonata as Haydn would have known it.

Beethoven's writing is generally agreed to fall into three periods. The first period being considered `decorative' and following the 18th century model ending with sonata 11; the last period having highly complex structures, emotionally demanding and introspective commencing with sonata 27; the middle period sonatas of 12-26 being the transitional period. The series allows us to follow this development very easily and Barenboim adjusts his playing to enable this to be followed clearly. As such this is a considerable achievement.

The slow movement of the ground-breaking 4th sonata is a clear move away from the Haydn model with the sonata's 30 minute total duration making this Beethoven's longest sonata until the far later Hammerklavier. Barenboim's performance gives it due gravitas without quite leaving the Classical period in which it is rooted. The seventh sonata brings further emphasis on emotional density of thought as evidenced by the extensive slow largo movement stretching to a full eleven minutes.

Other structural changes rapidly develop as we approach and progress through Beethoven's middle period. This is evidenced in the concluding scherzo of the tenth sonata, the opening slow movements of sonatas 12-14, the biting scherzo of sonata 12 which also includes a sombre funeral march later played at Beethoven's own funeral and the three-sectioned opening movement of the sonata 13 (andante-allegro-andante). Some sonatas have three movements and some have four.

Sonatas 20 and 21 are now thought to have been written in 1796 which places them alongside the earliest sonatas. This does not seem surprising given their obvious lack of complexity. There is a steady increase of dramatic tension and dynamic extremes throughout this middle period clearly apparent in sonatas 16, 17, 21 and 23 especially but not exclusively. The final set of six sonatas from sonata 27 onwards further develop complex counterpoint, variation form and harmonic relationships and together constitute Beethoven's final period.

These combined are all important structural changes which finally break the mould of the 18th century piano sonata.

Barenboim keeps all of these in context with his lighter and fleeter approach in this set compared to his Berlin set whilst still exploring the greater structural depths as they develop. It is generally agreed that Beethoven bids his farewell to the Classical period with the eleventh sonata.

Barenboim's finger-work is aurally very crisp and the style is noticeably more lyrical than in his later set and his use of the pedal is gentler without the accompanying thuds, to be heard in Berlin. The dynamic range of his touch is widened as the series progresses with the gentler moments becoming almost whisper-like and with the bigger moments becoming more powerfully delivered. In general terms the over-riding emphasis throughout this series is upon clarity and incisiveness of touch to achieve dramatic effect rather than weight and this is entirely appropriate to the Classical and early Romantic periods.

The filmed interpretation that Barenboim was seeking in order to draw out the structure can be illustrated, for example, by the prolonged view of the pianist seen at a distance through the space of the raised piano lid in sonata 14 for example. No finger-work, as the view imperceptibly closes in throughout the first movement of the sonata emphasising the calm simplicity of the movement. The first movement of sonata 8 receives much the same treatment. Sonata 9 is filmed in a windowless room which imparts a warmer colour palette. Sonata 12's funeral march is set in appropriately subdued conditions revealed at very slow speed with an extended view of one dark area of the room to match. Brighter movements are naturally set in brighter conditions. Sonata 16 is also initially filmed in very subdued lighting with highlights, rather like a painting of a Dutch indoor scene. As the sonata progresses so the lighting broadens and increases.

Sonatas 19 and 20 are filmed in a bare room with white and unadorned rooms and with bight lighting. This simplicity reflects the simplicity of these earlier works as they are now perceived. The later Waldstein sonata (21), on the other hand, is set in a highly ornamented room of considerable complexity. To emphasise the contrast of content in the middle movement, the room is plunged into virtual darkness with streaks of highlighting similar to high contrasted paintings of Dutch interiors. The last movement brings a return to lighting as the mood lifts.

The final series of sonatas is filmed in a large room dominated by substantial marble pillars and monumental in character. The area is kept brightly lit. Barenboim is able to unravel and clarify the complexities of these final sonatas remarkably well and the visual analogy seems appropriate given the intention and the available facilities.

These limited observations are offered as examples of the director's attempts to match the structures of the music visually as requested by Barenboim.

.............................

Overall summary:

This entire series is a fine effort. Barenboim was at his performing peak and he had a musical director who attempted to convey something other than finger-work or facial expressions as Barenboim required. The recording was at the best level possible at the time and has been enhanced to the best level available today. It deserves our gratitude rather than our criticism.

One detail worth mentioning is the erroneous statement before every single sonata that it was dedicated to Haydn. This is not the case and is clearly an unfortunate editing slip. Only the first three sonatas of opus 2 were, in fact, actually dedicated to Haydn.

In conclusion, I would suggest that these discs constitute a very major series which justifies the time, effort and cost of the work involved. Purchasers need to show a little understanding of the technical constraints associated with archive film and the presentational concepts attempted by Barenboim and the director.

Given those considerations, I would suggest that this set deserves serious consideration from anyone contemplating the purchase of a complete set of the sonatas. It certainly offers a very different filming concept and set of interpretations compared to Barenboim's later Berlin set recorded at a series of `live' concerts and presented out of chronological order. That delivers a far weightier set of interpretations.

This earlier set will, for many, be the more rewarding set of the two both in terms of period performing style and for other musical and pianistic considerations. It is an important archive document that remains as relevant today as it was when it was recorded but with the added advantage of having received a fine restoration which has made the most of the recorded material.",1417737600,10,11764,5.178515007898894
