767346,5,6304056893,"This spellbinding 1946 B&W flick, set in California, pits sultry Lana Turner against John Garfield in a neverending love-hate relationship, which ironically parallels the lives of its 2 stars. Turner, 7 times married & dead in 1995 at 74, is electrified at first glance by Garfield, in real life, a tough Jewish bad boy who was later blacklisted during the McCarthy era, and died in 1952 at 39. Classic scenes in this all-American classic include: shots in the Twin Oaks Diner,(owned by the husband Lana didn't love), including donuts and a steaming mug of coffee - full-body shots of Lana in shorts & halter top (one helluva beautiful dame) - and a wonderful ""love me or leave me"" scene in the Pacific Ocean, where Lana tests the love of the only man she has ever loved. According to legend, the title of this short James M. Cain novella had no relevance in the book. Not so in the movie. Find out for yourself why the postman always rings twice and why this is one of the greatest movies ever made.",1155427200,5,1000,4.561111111111111
767347,5,6304056893,"Lana Turner and John Garfield hunger for something more in Tay Garnett's glossy soap opera noir, ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" Based on James M. Cain's lusty potboiler, Turner is fantastic as the manipulative yet vulnerable Cora Smith and Garfield excellent as the drifter who can't get Cora or her dreams out of his blood. Turner is like a white creme, icy cold on the surface but burning hot and deep with desire underneath.

Cora is a girl aware of her looks and effect on men. Since she was 14 she's had to argue with men about it. But she didn't have to argue with Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway), a much older man Cora marries for security, not love. When drifter Frank Chambers (Grafield) shows up to fill the help wanted sign at the Twin Oaks Diner Nick and Cora run, she discovers she can't live without love or passion.

Cora is a smouldering vision in white when Frank first sees her, a room full of gas that only needs a spark to ignite. Frank knows he can sell anything to anybody and begins to fan the flames when he talks Nick into getting a neon sign for the diner Cora wants. Cora has big dreams for the diner and wants to be somebody. She tries in her own way to resist what is going to happen between she and Frank but deep down knows that all the things she married Nick for and clings to are the things she really wants with Frank.

Cora lets him kiss her once then stays away, working Frank into an internal frenzy of desire. After a midnight swim in the ocean they get a week alone and their fate is sealed, the gas ignited and burning out of control. It is Cora who lets Frank's lust simmer until he loves her and wants her so much nothing matters, not even what stands in the way of them and Cora's dreams.

Garfield is excellent as a guy who knows he's signed on for a one way ride to nowhere but can't help himself, because the mere thought of sharing the ride with Cora tips the scales. There is a tricky D.A. (Leon Ames) onto them after a botched first attempt to live out Cora's dreams fails and only a crafty defense attorney, portrayed with zeal by Hume Cronyn, gets Cora off when they finally succeed. But an insurance policy Frank didn't know about causes distrust and the results are Cora and Frank on the outs again.

But they are chained to each other. Jealousy and a blackmail attempt gone awry bring them back to the beach where they were happy. A dangerous swim to prove their trust in each other restores their love and they are happy and dreaming once again. They may be able to atone for their sins even, unless fate has other plans....

Turner gives an icy hot performance here, with many long takes between she and Garfield as they are drawn to each other like moths to a flame. Much is made of director Tay Garnett framing Turner in sexy white outfits throughout the film. Her best scene, however, and the one in which she is the most strikinginly beautiful, she is dressed in a black bathrobe. Cora is in the kitchen caressing a knife and agonizing over her dreams and what needs to be done to make them come true. When Frank walks in on her, her voice catches, her reluctance to follow through real. She tells Garfield in a quivering voice, ""If you really loved me.""

Whereas Wilder's Double Indemnity was a dark noir of twisted passion and greed set in Claifornia, Garnett's The Postman Always Rings Twice uses the bright sunshine and beaches of L.A. County in the 1940's to create a soap opera noir, a shining blonde Turner and a reluctant drifter Garfield at its center. A must for Turner fans and good pick for fans of this genre who want to watch a glossy noir.",1122076800,3,3614,4.385074626865672
767348,3,6304056893,"The best thing about this rather vapid 1946 production of the James M. Cain pulp novel/turned literature is Lana Turner as Cora, but not for her acting, which was ordinary, but because she looked so good.  Director Tay Garnett had her in stunning, shapely white dresses, pants and uni's that showed off her figure, complemented by a platinum hairdo that in glorious black and white was so intense it was almost colorful.  (People on the set may have needed to wear shades.)  After she returns from her mother's funeral, Garnett has her in the blackest black from a black hat to her black shoes--heels, I should emphasize, since she was almost always in heels in the movie, even returning from the beach or crawling up a canyon in the Santa Monica Mountains, she was in heels.
John Garfield, who plays Frank Chambers as though wandering through the role (which is not entirely inappropriate), is sympathetic and has the kind of raw animal appeal that we would expect to see in Cain's depression-era antihero.  But he too was not out to win any acting awards.  Cecil Kellaway, who plays Nick (in this case a ""Nick Smith,"" not the Greek immigrant Nick Papadakis from the novel) does the best acting job as he brings a bit of the delusive psychology of an older man with a beautiful young wife to life when he announces that he selling the caf and moving to the backwoods of Canada so Cora can take care of him and his invalid sister!  This bit of senile daydreaming was not in the novel; indeed a lot of what transpired in this self-conscious, misconstructed flick was not in the novel, including a sappy post-ending in which the title is ""explained.""  I won't go into the explanation except to say it wasn't convincing, but I can understand why they tacked it on since nowhere else (that I know of) is the title explained.  Cain's original, and appropriate title was, ""Bar-B-Que.""  See my review of the novel at Amazon.com for some speculation on how they came up with the rather magical title.
A better rendition of the Postman is the 1981 production starring Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange.  It too is no masterpiece, but it is both truer to the novel and less talky.  A true to the spirit of the novel adaptation would require a terse, stream-lined directorial style with an emphasis on blind animal passions unconsciously acted out, something novelist Cormac McCarthy might accomplish if he directed film.  I think that Christopher Nolan, who directed the strikingly original Memento (2000) could do it.",1026259200,5,2507,4.751152073732719
767349,5,6304056893,".
At the beginning of the movie, when Frank (excellent John Garfield)arrives to the lonely gas station, a sign makes explicit the movie plot: ""Man Wanted"". Cora (Lana Turner) needs desperately a man to satisfy her and kill her husband.
This is a criminal drama marked by destiny, thanks to James Cain, and exasperated by Niven Busch, greek tragedy and alarm signs lover: Cora first appears with a blindy white dress, and Frank's hamburger is burning. And, as it must be, a black cat starts the fatality of treason.
This movie is EXCELLENT, undoubtly the best NOIR there's ever been. John Garfield, before being accused of being a communist by senator McArthy, gave life to Frank, a handsome tramp that gets a job at a gas station where a ""man is wanted"". Lana Turner steals the show performing Cora, the beautiful and dreadful wife of the gas station owner, Cecil Kellaway. This is Tay Garnett's best work, and the cinematography is perfect for a movie that it's literally creepy, dark, desperate and lusty.
Definitely in myy Top 10 of all time. A TIMELESS CLASSIC!!!!",1024963200,16,1068,4.809782608695652
767350,5,6304056893,"If one had to sum up director Tay Garnett's greatest screen triumph, ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" in one scene, the logical choice would be the sizzling moment wherein Lana Turner drops her lipstick.  The camera's upsweep begins with the floor where the lipstick had fallen, moving up to her trim legs, then to a flawlessly beautiful lady in white.  Depression loner John Garfield takes one look at her and gulps.  The expression says it all.  Garfield is as hooked as Fred MacMurray in his first meeting with Barbara Stanwyck in ""Double Indemnity"" with the same result -- ultimate destruction.
After looking at Cecil Kellaway's young wife Garfield agrees to a job at the diner the genial older man runs.  Before long Turner and Garfield are sexually involved.  Not long after that Turner is proposing that they get rid of Kellaway.
What distinguishes this 1946 gem from more recent films is the way that the sex remains under the surface, with more suggesting than outright showing, which achieves powerful dramatic results.  Kellaway enjoys casual after dinner sessions where he plays his guitar and sings.  When he suggests that Garfield and Turner dance they stare at each other, half in irony, half in guilt.  Due to Turner's prodding, Garfield eventually agrees to kill a man who has been thoroughly supportive and very kind to him, treating him like a son.
James M. Cain's powerful novella retains its suspenseful pacing and savage bite on screen.  The title is perfection.  ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" refers to the tradition of, when knocking on the door to deliver mail, a postman would ring a second time if receiving no answer initially.  Garfield is convicted by aggressive district attorney Leon Ames the second time, over Turner's accidental death in a car accident, rather than for his involvement in Kellaway's death.  He ultimately accepts his fate, asking the priest who has visited his death row cell just before his execution to send a prayer heavenward for himself and the woman he loved.",1009584000,3,2020,4.976190476190476
767351,5,6304056893,"I love all film noirs because of the way they were filmed and acted. The setting were always fantastic and the plots always teeming with murder,  blackmail, and alienation. The characters were low-lifes, detectives, or femme fatales. In all film noirs, there is romance, but the sexiest film noir, by far, is the original version of The Postman Always Rings Twice. The on-screen chemistry between platinum blonde Lana Turner and drifter John Garfield is enough to carry a 113 minute movie. Throw in Cecil Kellaway  and Hume Cronyn as part of the great supporting cast, a wonderful story by James M. Cain, and tragic irony and the result is one of the fastest moving, most enjoyable film noirs produced in the golden age of Hollywood.
Lana Turner's Cora ranks as one of the most seemingly innocent and utterly drop-dead beautiful goddesses ever to touch the silver screen.",994896000,9,871,4.918367346938775
767352,5,6304056893,"Taken from the once-popular novel by James M. Cain, this story is steeped in repressed sexuality, involving a bizarre love triangle among two young lovers and an elderly husband played by Kellaway. Essentially, this film is more interesting for the visual and physical tension between Turner and Garfield than for any other single element. Scenes which stand out both visually and dramatically include the murder sequence in which the young lovers try to electrocute the old man and, of course, the famed scene in the car where Garfield strikes Kellaway with a whiskey bottle. Lana is cool and calculating as the frustrated young wife of the old coot and she made quite a sensation looking ravishing in her all-white wardrobe (notice how she contrasts with Garfield's dark, brooding look). This film was an important step in Turner's film career and one can see what all the fuss was about when seeing her in this. Garfield is natural and excellent as the young tough drifter. Hume Cronyn and Leon Ames score as the mercenary lawyers, however the script could have been a bit sharper at times (it should have been more similar to that of THE BIG SLEEP or THE MALTESE FALCON.",960595200,2,1174,4.845771144278607

As such, it's good that Warner Bros. chose to remaster on Blu-ray the original, 1946 ""Postman Always Rings Twice"" from MGM with John Garfield and Lana Turner simultaneously with their own 1981 remake with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange.  Of the two, it's still the Garfield-Turner film that reigns supreme.

As you probably know, the French coined the term ""film noir"" (or ""dark film"") back in the Fifties to describe movies of the previous decade and beyond that derived from the cynicism of World War II, movies popularized in the United States, movies depicting a dark and despairing atmosphere where paranoia abounded.  The settings for these dark films were usually urban worlds of shadow, smoke, and fog, and the subject matter usually concerned some sort of crime or detection.  A film like ""The Maltese Falcon"" (1941) is among the first good examples of the genre, which reached its peak in things like ""Double Indemnity"" (1944) and ""The Third Man"" (1949).

""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946) exhibits all the characteristics of the noir film, including the femme fatale, a deadly female who lures the hero into a web of mystery and intrigue.  The screenwriters based their movie on the best-selling novel by James M. Cain, whose admirers weren't at all pleased with the changes the filmmakers made to the author's rather racy book; but there was the Production Code to think about at the time, and the studio had to impose a good deal of censorship.  Which means the film had to suggest a lot of sensuality rather than show it.

The movie features the enigmatic tough guy John Garfield as a penniless drifter who picks up a job at a lunch room and gas station located on a side road outside Los Angeles.  Garfield's character, Frank Chambers, is a decent sort of guy, but he's not above the occasional con game, and it's obvious he has led a rough-and-tumble life, never settling down.  He's also something of a ladies' man, and the boss's wife, Cora, is a knockout.  It takes Chambers less than two minutes of meeting her before he plants a big one on her kisser, and she doesn't resist.

Movie siren Lana Turner plays Cora Smith, the young woman who has married a much older man, Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway), for security rather than love, and who is quick to see the prospects of the hired hand.  The first time Frank sees Cora, she's in shorts, all legs, and looking helplessly, teasingly sexy.  It makes for a terrific introduction to Cora's character, actually, shown from the feet and ankles up.

From there, the movie develops two stories.  The first is the romance between Frank and Cora, carried on under the nose of the naively trusting husband; the second is the mystery and its consequences when Cora and Frank decide the old man's got to go.  Cora persuades Frank to arrange an ""accident"" for the unsuspecting sap.

But the local DA (Leon Ames) is on to them and their schemes, and before the movie's out, you'll find further infidelity, suspense, blackmail, double crosses, triple crosses, and surprises galore.  In fact, if there is any serious problem with the story, it's that it tacks on too many twists, especially at the end.  It never knows when to quit.

Still, in addition to Garfield and Turner, you'll relish a standout performance by Hume Cronyn as the couple's clever but unscrupulous lawyer, a performance that almost upstages Garfield and Turner themselves.  And along the way there is some smoldering passion, at least in appearance if not in deed, and some terrific noir cinematography in the use of light and shadow.

Finally, the movie treats the viewer to a few delicious double entendres as well.  If the censors wouldn't allow the film to show too much, at least the filmmakers were going to imply what was going on, and the film projects an undercurrent of barely disguised passions and sexuality.  The looks between Garfield and Turner are a joy to behold.  Then there are lines like Garfield's ""I could sell anything to anybody"" and Turner's ""You won't find anything cheap around here.""  Even the ""Man Wanted"" sign at the beginning of the picture suggests more than it says.

""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" exemplifies the noir movement in Hollywood, as I've said, even if Hollywood didn't call it that at the time.  Part sultry romance, part mystery thriller, the movie continues to keep audiences involved with its edgy character relationships and unforeseen tensions.

Video:
Warner Brothers use a dual-layer BD50 and an MPEG-4/AVC codec to transfer the 1.33:1 ratio, black-and-white picture to Blu-ray, the image clean and free of most age marks:  no specks, flecks, scratches, or apparent fades do we notice.  The overall appearance of the picture is slightly grainy as we might expect, and some scenes are a bit on the soft side, particularly nighttime shots.  Definition looks, as I say, a tad softer on some occasions than others, but otherwise it's fine.  There are fairly good black-and-white contrasts, too, with often deep blacks and glistening whites.  The resulting PQ is probably about as good as the improved source material allows.

Audio:
The sound here is neither good nor bad but typical of a 1940s' monaural soundtrack, reproduced as well as possible in lossless DTS-HD Master Audio.  What seemed to me a bit forward and hard in the earlier DVD's Dolby Digital now sounds smooth and easy on the ear.  Anyway, don't expect too much in the way of frequency range, although dynamic response is surprisingly wide.  For an old movie, the audio comes off well, and dialogue is quite clear.

Extras:
The Blu-ray disc carries over the same extras found on the DVD release and adds a few more.  The first item is a five-minute introduction to the movie by USC film professor, historian, and author Richard Jewell.  Next is an eighty-six minute biography, ""Lana Turner:  A Daughter's Memoir,"" followed by the fifty-seven minute biography, ""The John Garfield Story.""  After these documentaries are the featurettes ""Phantoms, Inc.,"" a seventeen-minute entry in the ""Crime Does Not Pay"" series; ""Red Hot Riding Hood,"" an MGM cartoon directed by Tex Avery; and a twenty-nine minute Screen Guild Theater radio broadcast of the story starring Turner and Garfield.

The extras wrap with a theatrical trailer; thirty-two scene selections; English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Portuguese spoken languages; French, Spanish, and Portuguese subtitles; and English, German, and Italian captions for the hearing impaired.

Parting Thoughts:
Warner Bros. remade ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" in 1981 with Jack Nicholson and Jessica Lange, mainly to capitalize on the new freedom the cinema provided by then to include some of the steamier scenes they had to tame for the original.  Unfortunately, the newer, sexier version was less effective than the first, despite its greater frankness.  I suppose it goes to show that the imagination is still a filmmaker's most potent ally.

In any case, viewers will enjoy the strong, smoldering relationship between John Garfield and Lana Turner in the original ""Postman,"" and they'll get the benefit of some fine stylistic photography, a slew of surprises, and the whole noir atmosphere.  It's not a great movie, perhaps, and maybe not the absolute best movie in the noir genre, either, but it's a good, absorbing movie, nevertheless, made all the better by high definition.",1434412800,,7408,4.99185667752443

767581,4,6304056893,"There are certainly classics of the mystery/noir genre any fan at least recognizes by title.  For me, one of those was The Postman Always Rings Twice.  I decided it was time to learn a bit more about the story thanks to the classic black and white 1946 movie, which I enjoyed.

The story follows Frank Chambers (John Garfield), a drifter who happens upon a gas station/restaurant outside a coastal California town.  The owner of the restaurant, Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway), is looking for a hand around the place.  Frank isn't interested until he meets Cora (Lana Turner).  Suddenly, hes willing to hire on so he can woo this beautiful woman.  Unfortunately, she happens to be Nicks much younger wife.

That doesnt stop Frank, and soon the two are madly in love.  Theres just the problem of Nick.  Soon they have decided to kill Nick so they can live together happily.  But can they get away with it if they even succeed?

Im going say no more about the plot since there were a couple twists I didn't know about, and I think I enjoyed it better as a result.  I definitely got pulled into things as I began rooting for Frank and Cora to manage to get a happy ending despite the fact that they are evil people.

I liked the ending.  In some ways, it felt rushed, but really, there would have been nothing served by dragging it out.  The main story was over, and what we got tied up the loose ends well.

The real star of this film is Lana Turner.  She is phenomenal as the femme fatal.  She has the most complex character and she plays Cora brilliantly.  The rest of the characters are less complex, but those actors are great as well. There is a level of acting here you won't find in many films today.  And the romance between Frank and Cora sizzles with just glances and kisses.

Movies from the 40s often have an acting style that wed view as overacting today, and it shows up here.  Yet its a minor issue.

I do have a couple of issues with the film.  The pacing could be a bit tighter as a couple of spots seem to drag and a few go by too quickly.  But that could be a different of the era.

My biggest complaint is the title.  Frank has a speech at the end that explains it, but I think the story deserved a better title.  The analogy he uses is a bit tortured, although it does work.  Ironically, it was added to the film to try to explain the title  the book has no explanation at all.  Still, it would have been better worked into the story instead of a lecture at the end.

Minor complaints aside, this is a film noir classic for a reason.  Anyone interested in the genre or classic films will certainly enjoy The Postman Always Rings Twice.",1429228800,,2650,4.319105691056911

As I watched it the first time, I remember thinking ""wow"" several times.

It is great movie-making!  I am starting to think that the 1940's were the golden age of American films.  And Lana Turner, who I had never seen on screen before, is superb here, in both performance and appearance.",1414454400,,651,4.568965517241379

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Youve gotta love those femme fatales. Devious, passionate, manipulative, and oh-so-sexy, they can turn a tough male into a drooling lapdog within seconds, and lead him panting down the road to self-destruction. Barbara Stanwyck in 'Double Indemnity,' Joan Bennett in 'The Woman in the Window,' Jean Simmons in 'Angel Face,' the list goes on. Some are rotten-to-the-core, others just plain rotten, yet all use sex and vulnerability to poison their prey. Guys like Fred MacMurray, Edward G. Robinson, and Robert Mitchum think they can handle such icy-hot dames, but they're way, way out of their league. Sure, we feel sorry for these good men gone wrong, but deep down we know, if given a second chance, they'd make the same bad choices all over again. So sweet is the honey of Hollywood's queen bees.

Yet of all the fatalistic femmes, Lana Turner in 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' is perhaps the quintessential specimen. As Cora Smith, the sultry cook at a roadside dive, she's cool, calculating, and devastatingly carnal. Her white-as-snow outfits denote spiritual purity, but her platinum blonde hair betrays the lie. No wonder drifter Frank Chambers [John Garfield] falls for her. To him, she's an angel. Unfortunately, he doesn't realise she's an angel of death until he's trapped in her deceitful web. Attracted by the ""Man Wanted"" sign outside the hamburger joint she owns with her much older husband Nick Smith [Cecil Kellaway], Frank Chambers inquires about a job. But after meeting Cora Smith, he soon realises he's ""wanted"" for other things too, especially love, sex, maybe even murder. As far as the order goes, take your pick.

It all starts innocently enough. It seems Cora Smith married the portly, unkempt Nick Smith, to escape all the ravenous wolves nipping at her skirts. Dirt poor, she saw the Twin Oaks Restaurant as a ticket to self-improvement and economic security. Yet when Frank ambles along and ignites her flame, she hungers for all the passion she's been missing. Cora Smith melts in Frank Chambers's embrace, but can't bear the thought of sharing his nomadic, impoverished existence. And she knows if Nick Smith ever discovers their clandestine affair, he'll cut her off without a penny.

So what's left for the illicit lovers? In their dead-end lives, all they can see is murder. Bump off Nick  Smith, beat the rap, share the restaurant, and live happily ever after. Sounds like quite a plan. It's just the execution and avoiding execution, that's the problem. Poisoned by suspicion and weakened by panic and fear, the pair soon loses control of their own game, becoming mere pawns in a legal chess match between District Attorney Kyle Sackett [Leon Ames] and Cora's smarmy lawyer, Arthur Keats [Hume Cronyn]. Crosses, double-crosses, blackmail, and other assorted twists ensue and keep us riveted throughout the film.

James M. Cain published his first novel The Postman Always Rings Twice in 1934, and the racy, sordid yarn incited a firestorm of controversy, culminating with the city of Boston banning the book. Hollywood wouldn't touch it until 12 years later, after two other James M. Cain adaptations Double Indemnity and Mildred Pierce, garnered critical and popular acclaim. Amazingly, it wasn't gritty Warner Bros. that snapped up the rights, but wholesome M-G-M the home to sumptuous musicals, Andy Hardy, and Lassie. Although Hollywood's production code sanitised the novel's lewd, raw tone, M-G-M provided additional softening by enhancing the romantic angle. In the book, talk of murder begins on page 14, but more than a half-hour of character development transpires in the film before Cora Smith plants her homicidal seeds. During that time and throughout the rest of the film, John Garfield and Lana Turner add welcome sensitivity to their roles, fooling us into believing that love and not lust or greed, but drives them to their doom. Somehow, they gain our sympathy, and we often find ourselves rooting for them, despite their dastardly deeds and our own moral beliefs. After all, who can resist two crazy, murderous people in love? The film never approaches the hard edge of 'Double Indemnity,' but the love affair adds depth and lends 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' a refreshing soulful quality that resonates during its climax and denouement.

Director Tay Garnett tried to tarnish M-G-M's gloss by shooting chunks of the script on dusty locations, but the studio's patented ""look"" still peeks through. That's not entirely bad, especially when one reflects on Cora Smith's glamorous and now classic cinematic introduction. As a lipstick rolls across the restaurant floor, a slow backward pan reveals a woman's shapely legs, followed by John Garfield's stunned and breathless reaction as he digests the heavenly view. Only then does Tay Garnett cut to a full-body shot of Lana Turner, dressed like an angel of sex in white shorts, white halter top, and a white turban swathed around her platinum hair. She holds out her hand like a princess, waiting for John Garfield to deliver the lipstick. He makes her come and get it, which is a very iconic sequence, especially coming from a typical M-G-M Studio.

Both Lana Turner and John Garfield are pitch-perfect in their parts, creating a steamy chemistry that carries the film and adds dimension to the hard-boiled story. Always an underrated actress whose beauty overshadowed her talent, Lana Turner files perhaps her finest performance, deftly complicating the femme fatale stereotype by layering Cora with just enough sincerity and softness to gain audience affection, and keep her true colours a mystery. John Garfield's natural acting style allowed him to believably inhabit any role, and he makes Frank Chambers the ultimate everyman, a poor sap in love with his fantasy girl, willing to sell his soul for a kiss or caress. Who can't identify with that?

As the sparring attorneys, Leon Ames and Hume Cronyn nearly steal the show. Their spirited legal wrangling and slick manipulation of Cora and Frank offer a cerebral counterpoint to the lovers' sexual and emotional tension, and provide the film with its most fascinating and colourful moments. Although the Nick Smith [Cecil Kellaway] character is a far cry from the book's oily, grimy depiction of the Greek-born Nick Smith, he's enough of a tubby sad sack to serve his purpose, and even engenders some pity.

The film's only real misstep is its slightly overdramatic score, which often intrudes with such frenzy and fury it ridicules the on-screen action. It badly dates this classic movie, yet the story's power and texture endure. Coupled with assured direction, exceptional performances, and the heady atmosphere of sex, violence, and intrigue, 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' remains richly entertaining and engrossing, a finely cut diamond in the rough world of film noir.

Blu-ray Video Quality  This 1080p encoded image transfer seems to be struck from the same master as the 2004 NTSC DVD, but appears a tad brighter and more vibrant. That's almost always a good thing, but some of the exterior shots, all of which are bathed in a dusty white glare, at times look slightly overexposed. Interiors, however, possess excellent contrast and clarity, showcasing Sidney Wagner's naturalistic cinematography. Black levels are solid, though not quite as inky as I was anticipating, but it's the whites that steal the show and a rarity in the world of film noir. From Lana Turner's platinum hair to her monochromatic ensembles, whites are on constant display, yet they never bloom and always exude a definite gradation of hue, thanks to a finely constructed grey scale. Even in the murkiest scenes, crush is never an issue, and superior shadow delineation exposes a wide array of detail. Typical of a film from this vintage, grain is pronounced and in some scenes more than others, but not overwhelming, and is more noticeable during soft-focus close-ups, especially those of Lana Turner. Textures come through well and the lucidity of the weave on the burlap fabric during the opening credits is extraordinary and background elements are always easy to discern. While the NTSC DVD exhibited a fair amount of white specks, the Blu-ray is free of any markings; a few times I thought I saw a stray speck or two, but it was merely wisps of Lana Turner's hair, which gives you an idea of this transfer's degree of clarity. No digital doctoring disrupts the integrity of the original source and no transfer anomalies intrude. Overall, 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' looks quite good, though it pales when compared to the studio's best black-and-white Blu-ray discs. And while this effort isn't a huge step up from the previously released inferior NTSC DVD, the subtle improvements make a notable enough difference to merit an upgrade.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio track supplies clean, well-modulated sound, despite some interesting challenges. George Bassman's music score can be seductively romantic one minute and bombastically melodramatic the next, but the track handles the severe volume shifts well. A hint of distortion creeps in occasionally, but on the whole, the music enjoys good fidelity and fine tonal depth. All the action is anchored up front, but accents such as screams and the pounding waves of the Pacific surf penetrate the room well. Dialogue is always clear and easy to comprehend, even when seductively whispered by Turner. A smattering of hiss pops up here and there, but it's hardly noticeable, and any pops, crackles, or other instances of surface noise have been meticulously erased. For a 66-year-old track, 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' sounds surprisingly spry, and more robust than its inferior NTSC DVD counterpart.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Introduction by Richard Jewell [480i] [1.33:1] [5:04] This just over five-minute preamble by film historian and author Richard Jewell only skims the surface of this classic production, providing an elementary primer for viewers largely unfamiliar with 'Postman Always Rings Twice,' Garfield, Turner, and director Garnett. Jewell analyses the famous rolling lipstick sequence and talks about how M-G-M groomed Lana Turner as a blonde bombshell in the mould of the late Jean Harlow, a slightly dubious assessment at best. It's too bad Warner Home Video didn't see fit to produce a more in-depth look at 'Postman Always Rings twice,' as this cursory examination only whets our appetite for a full-fledged documentary.

Special Feature Documentary: Lana Turner: A Daughter's Memoir [2001] [480i] [1.33:1] [86:30] This feature-length documentary which was originally aired on Turner Classic Movies and provides an intimate chronicle of Lana Turner's often scandalous, always fascinating life and multi-decade career. Cheryl Crane talks about her mother, Lana Turner, in this documentary, Lana Turner...A Daughter's Memoir. Lana Turner's private life often overshadowed her film work, some of which was excellent. Beautiful as well as sexy, the actress started out at M-G-M as a teenager. Her career lasted 54 years. Narrated by Robert Wagner, the prime interviewee is Cheryl Crane, who looks lovely and comes off as very intelligent as she comments on her mother's life, which is punctuated by photos and film clips. She also speaks frankly about the great scandal and her stabbing of Lana Turner's gangster lover, Johnny Stompanato. There are interviews as well with Lana Turner's long-time makeup man, her good  friend Evie Johnson, and others. One of the film clips is of Tyrone Power, the great love of Lana Turner's life, playing with Cheryl as Lana Turner sits beside him. ""He was the one she didn't get to keep,"" Cheryl Crane says. Lana Turner is portrayed as a party-loving, man-loving woman who was somewhat of a negligent mother, leaving Cheryl Crane with her nanny for huge periods of time. It was only later in their lives that the two developed a strong relationship. Negligent didn't mean uncaring, however - when she learned that her current husband, Lex Barker, was abusing Cheryl Crane, she threw him out of the house. What emerges is a portrait of a woman who loved stardom, loved being beautiful, and loved being attractive to men. When looked at closely, her life was both traumatic and somewhat empty. Lucky for Turner, she had a daughter who cared about her and which is something some other female stars didn't have.

Special Feature Documentary: The John Garfield Story [2003] [480i] [1.33:1] [57:43] The documentary traces John Garfield's rise from a tough childhood on New York's Lower East Side through his vagabond youth and apprenticeship with the renowned Group Theatre to his Oscar nominated breakthrough as a film star in Four Daughters [1938]. A forerunner to such tough-yet-sensitive rebels as Marlon Brando, James Dean, and John Garfield displayed what Lee Grant calls his ""smouldering, sombre, troubled street-guy kind of presence"" in such hard-hitting films as Humoresque [1946] and Force of Evil [1948]. This is a much more involving of the The John Garfield Story, a fascinating and impeccably produced profile that originally aired on Turner Classic Movies. Narrated by the actor's daughter, Julie Garfield, the portrait begins at John Garfield's funeral, which was apparently the largest for a Hollywood personality since Rudolph Valentino's, and featured 10,000 mourners and sadly the actor died of heart failure in 1952 at the age of 39. From there, we go back in time, and follow the progression of Jacob Julius Garfinkle, who is affectionately known as Julie Garfield, and from his involvement with the left-leaning Group Theatre in New York to his instant Hollywood success. The documentary details John Garfield's war contributions, and how one such visit to Yugoslavia came back to haunt him, especially his dedication to casting minority actors in his films, and his devastating investigation by the House Un-American Activities Committee, which friends and colleagues claim indirectly caused his early death. Rare colour footage of the actor, substantive film clips. Among other admiring contemporary actors interviewed in this look at John Garfield's all-too-brief life and career are Joanne Woodward, Richard Dreyfuss, Lee Grant and Norman Lloyd. Co-stars who recall working with Garfield include Hume Cronyn in The Postman Always Rings Twice [1946] and Patricia Neal in The Breaking Point [1950] and all contribute to make this fascinating documentary special film the success it is, which also helped to especially making it an absorbing and enlightening film.

Special Feature: Vintage Short: Phantoms, Inc. [1945] [480i] [1.33:1] [16:45] An instalment form M-G-M's Crime Doesn't Pay series. The police have files on many different types of con artists, among them fake spiritualists or psychics who prey upon the desperation of individuals looking for information as comfort. One specific individual for which they have a file is Dr. Rupert Trykel, who called himself a spiritualist, but who was really a shyster. He had stable of associates who acted both as his faithful followers to their marks, but also as researchers who dug up the most basic of information on those marks to use to feed back to the mark at their sessions. One of his marks was Mrs. Martha Kenneson, who was desperate for information on her son, Philip Kenneson Jr., a soldier who had been listed as MIA for six months when she first went to see Dr. Rupert Trykel. As desperate as Mrs. Martha Kenneson was to find out information about her son, for which she would continually and somewhat happily pay for more and more, people like Dr. Rupert Trykel, who work just within the law, are equally desperate: desperate to maintain their con and what they see as easy money without regard for what they are doing to their victims. This desperation on both sides often leads to desperate acts.

Special Feature: Vintage M-G-M Animated Short: Red Hot Riding Hood [480i] [1.33:1] [7:16] This clever 1943 Tex Avery cartoon puts a sexy spin on the age-old children's tale by turning Little Red Riding Hood into a sultry nightclub singer, the Wolf into...well, a lecherous wolf, and Grandma into a wanton red hot mama desperate for love. This sensual adaptation of the old fairy story soon liberates its principals from their cute Disney-style forest and slaps them right in the middle of swanky Manhattan. Grandma's a nymphomaniac swinger, and her rustic cottage home a hip penthouse pad. Little Red has become a red-hot singer-stripper; the Wolf is a model of lupine lechery; and the forest is supplanted by a big-city nightclub as the enchanted place of forbidden sexuality. The Wolf tries to pull the old Red Riding Hood gag in order to meet up with Little Red, but Grandma has other ideas.

Special Feature: Screen Guild Theater Broadcast: Vintage Radio Adaptation [1947] [29:00] ""The Screen Guild Theater"" broadcast this radio adaptation of the film on 16th June, 1947 with Lana Turner and John Garfield reprise their film roles as Frank Chambers and Cora Smith in this Screen Guild Theater broadcast radio adaptation that pares the steamy drama down to a real lean and mean drama. Huge chunks of the story are either glossed over or deleted, but the drama's aura of passion and hard-boiled nature remain. This is the third version of The Postman Always Rings Twice"" novel.

Theatrical Trailer [1946] [480i] [1.33:1] [2:31] The film's original preview emphasises the story's salacious elements and oddly gives away a critical plot point. ""Darling, can't you see how happy you and I would be together here? Without . . . him.""

Finally, Film noir doesn't get much better than this. Thanks to Tay Garnett's no-nonsense direction and terrific performances by Lana Turner and John Garfield, 'The Postman Always Rings Twice' still sinks its teeth into viewers today. James M. Cain's searing tale of passion, murder, and inescapable retribution grabs us from the opening frames and never lets go. An above-average video transfer and solid audio make this Blu-ray as irresistible as Lana Turner herself, and a great spate of new supplements, along with those from the previous inferior NTSC DVD, which seals the upgrade deal, as well as an enthusiastic recommendation for this classic film and high-quality disc. Although the re-make was okay, this true classic 1946 film-noir, beats all others hands down and it is another film that has been a massive favourite of mine and now seeing it in the stunning black and white images on this Blu-ray, makes it a must have and when I first viewed this Blu-ray, I realised I had gained a truly wonderful classic film and a total honour to add it to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

767740,5,6304056893,"In this film noir pot boiler, actors Lana Turner and John Garfield were two of the biggest stars in Hollywood.  And both are at the top of their game in this Tay Garnett directed film.  Garfield, in one of his best performances, plays Frank Chambers.  After catching a ride hitchhiking he stumbles into a diner with a ""Man Wanted"" sign posted outside.  The sign has double meaning as the story plays out.  The diner is owned by Nick Smith (Cecil Kellaway) and his younger, much younger wife Cora (Turner).

In a great scene early in the film, Nick has gone into town on some errands and Cora makes her entrance by dropping her lipstick which roles over to Frank's feet.  We don't see her at first, nor does Frank.  He picks up the lipstick and looks up along with the rest of us to find young Cora.  She's a platinum blond, decked out in a glistening white 2-piece outfit with short shorts and her hair neatly tucked into a turban.  You can see Frank gasp ever so faintly, as did I.  She's a knockout and yes, we know where this is all headed.

Bored with her life with dull Nick, Cora and Frank begin their affair and quietly plot Nick's demise.  Based on a novel by James M. Cain and adapted for the screen by Harry Ruskin and Niven Busch, ""Postman"" is quintessential noir.  We have the good, bad guy and the innocent good guy.  And of course the bad girl that usually gets her way.  This terrific picture was one of Garfield and Turner's best work, although reports were that they were not fond of each other.  You would never know it by watching their work here.

The Blu ray package is a winner.  The transfer is in 1080p with a 1.37:1 aspect ratio.  The extras however are all in standard definition.  While the film may not be quite as sharp as some black and white films I've seen, it looks very good.  Some of the night scenes seem like daylight to me but than is probably just limitations of the original photography.  The audio is DTS-HD Master Audio mono, delivered from the front channels.  Likewise it shouldn't be expected to be groundbreaking but it is clear and crisp with limited noise.

Included in the Blu ray version of 1946's ""The Postman Always Rings Twice,"" is ""Lana Turner: A Daughter's Memoir.""  This 86 minute documentary does a nice job of highlighting the long career of glamorous film star, Lana Turner.  It is narrated by Robert Wagner and includes some juicy tidbits from Turner's only child, Cheryl Crane.  She was the lonely product of Turner and her second husband, restaurateur Stephen Crane.  Turner was married 7 times and had numerous other lovers.  Ms. Crane was a casualty of being ignored by her mother, although they became closer in Turner's later life.  Crane became headline fodder in 1958, when at the age of 14 stabbed to death her mother's lover, gangster Johnny Stompanato.  Crane also alleges being molested repeatedly by her mother's fourth husband, actor Lex Barker (Tarzan films).  There are numerous other contributors including Kirk Douglas, Robert Stack, Juanita Moore and her make-up artist and confidant Del Armstrong.  The documentary is very interesting if you are curious about actors and film studios in the late 30's and 1940's.

 ""The John Garfield Story"" (2003): This is another documentary included on the Blu ray version of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (1946).  While it doesn't go into much depth of the man himself, the film does cover most of his career leading up to his untimely death at age 39.  The film is narrated by his youngest daughter, Julie Garfield (Julie was John's real name).  Naturally her father is shown in the best light possible with plenty of talking head accolades by various people who knew Garfield.  Those included actors James Cromwell, Hume Cronyn, Richard Dreyfuss, Danny Glover, Lee Grant and many others.

Other extras include a film introduction by Richard Jewell, a 16 minute short called ""Phantoms, Inc."" about confidence men preying of unexpected victims of the era (1940's), a color cartoon called ""Red Hot Riding Hood,"" a theatrical trailer and an audio only version of a Screen Guild Theater Broadcast.",1360454400,16,4114,4.738028169014084

767744,3,6304056893,"The story is good and so is the acting by the two main characters who try not to fall in love but eventually do.  Garfield is a stranger who shows up at a diner combination gas station looking for a little spending money before moving on.  He just happened to hitch a ride to the diner with the local district attorney.  Lana Turner plays the bored beautiful, much younger, wife of the owner who wants to hire Garfield to work for him.  Turner drops her lipstick in the diner while her husband Nick is out tending the pump for a customer.  She expects men to grovel at her feet and when the lipstick is picked up but not put in her hand she walks over to get it back.  That sets the stage for the future.

Eventually the two have a romance and decide to run away.  But Turner becomes hot and tired hitch hiking and decides they should go back and she doesn't want to leave empty handed.  They plot to kill Nick by dropping ball bearings in the bathtub while he showers and he will fall and hit his head in the tub and die.  The plan calls for Turner to go into the bathroom while Nick is showering and drop the bearings in the tub, lock the bathroom door from the inside and climb down a waiting step ladder.  Garfield is waiting by the car and will honk the car horn if anyone shows up.  But the local cop shows up on his motorcycle and sees the ladder since a cat is up on the steps.  The cops reason for stopping is weak.  He sees the car setting there and asks if that is Garfield's car.  Like he wouldn't recognize the owner's car parked legally on his own property?  The story needed a device to get the cop to stop and see the ladder.  But the reason is weak.  The cop leaves again.

The cat accidentally shorts out the wires by climbing up on the roof and the house goes dark and Turner screams.  She comes down stairs and said Nick fell as planned but since the cop saw the ladder they can't let Nick die so they need to call a doctor.  An ambulance comes and takes them to the hospital.  Now while they are waiting to hear if Nick will live the local cop and the district attorney show up together and the couple explain what happened that the cat shorted out the lights and Nick must have fallen when it happened.  The DA and Garfield are standing next to each other trying not to look at each other directly but simply swivel their eyes to see what the other is doing.  A little corny.

Also why did the DA show up for a simple accident?  DA's don't normally go to the hospital where no suspected foul play happened.  Why should he not believe their story unless the wife had a past history or Nick had suffered other suspicious accidents.  None of that was true.

This is where I believe the story is very weak.

Soon the two conspire to kill him again when Nick decides to sell the business and his wife must move into the husband's sister's home and take care of his sister after she became ill.  Turner does not see herself as a live in nurse.  The next day they will leave early to drive to LA to finish the sale of the business.  They get Nick drunk and will drive to LA detouring along a road with a steep drop off.  Again the DA just happens to stop at the station to fill his tires with air as the 3 are leaving.  The 3 take a detour then stop in a remote spot near a steep cliff, hit Nick over the head and push the car over the cliff.  But it doesn't go as planned and the car stops on a ledge below.  Garfield and Turner climb down to the car and Garfield climbs into the car just as it rolls the rest of the way down the cliff with him in it now.  Turner climbs up to the road and waves down a car which so happens to be the DA.

Why would someone climb into a car that could roll off the cliff any minute?  How did the DA just happen to know when they planned to leave and drive to LA and follow them?  And if the DA was following them from such a far distance as they had time to hit Nick over the head, push the car over the cliff and then they climbed down to the car before they saw the headlights on his approaching car, he couldn't have been all that close.

These are the main problems I have with this movie.  It assumes the audiance won't care about details and just follow the bigger story.  In that sense I find the movie too predictable and could have been far better as Hitchcock movies do not leave out the details.  Had Hitchcock made this movie it would have been far better I predict.",1355616000,2,4427,4.096511627906977

Cain novel of the same name. This is the only time that John Garfield and Lana Turner appeared on screen together and they both give two of the best performances of their respective careers. Turner is especially outstanding as Cora Smith, the young bride(and obviously unsatisfied) of the much older Cecil Kellaway who owns the roadside diner. The introduction of Turner's character is one of the greatest ever put on film which everyone needs to see just to show how great filmmaking can be. From that unforgetable entrance until the end of the picture, Turner's Cora Smith is something to behold. She's ""perfect"" in every sense of the word but only on the outside. Perfect hair, perfect make-up, perfect clothes, etc. Dressing in white throughout most of the picture, she's anything but ""pure"". She's the ultimate ""femme fatale"" and Garfield soon gets caught in her web. John Garfield was loaned to MGM for this picture and Turner thought he was all wrong for the lead. Having just ended his seven year contract with Warner Bros(1938-1946) Garfield was embarking on his most productive years in films with not only this picture but ""Body and Soul"" & ""Gentleman's Agreement""(both from 1947) and ""Force of Evil""(1948). He was the first of the Method actors when he arrived in Hollywood in 1938 for his first film. By the time he died 1952 he had paved the way for Montgomery Clift, Marlon Brando, and James Dean as well as a host of other actors. This Blu Ray release is the third of Garfield's films to be released on Blu Ray this year. Previous to this Warner release, Olive Films released ""Body and Soul"" and ""Force of Evil"" on Blu Ray with excellent results. Warner's Blu Ray of ""Postman"" is not perfect like Turner's character, but it's probably the best we're going to get. It's obvious that it wasn't struck from the original negative and it's doubtful that the original still exists. There is still a lot of grain visable in the film which is why I'm only giving it four stars. However, there are no vertical lines. white specks, dirt, torn or damaged frames and picture contrast is excellent with blacks and whites appearing sharper. All and all, it's an above average Blu Ray but not excellent(Bitrate: 24.77). However, compared to the standard DVD it is much improved. ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" is 113 minutes and contains the following subtitles: English, French, Spanish(Castillian), Spanish(Latino), Portuguese, German, and Italian. The Audio is English DTS-HD Master Audio Mono 1.0 and Dolby Digital Mono for the following: Spanish, Portuguese, German, and Italian. Some of the special features include ""The John Garfield Story"" narrated by his daughter Julie Garfield and ""Lana Turner: A Daughter's Memoir"" by her daughter Cheryl Crane. If you've never seen ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" and love film noir at it's best, then I would highly recommend getting this new Blu Ray from Warner Home Video. It comes highly recommended.",1353196800,5,3388,4.956063268892795

But the extras on here are what make this worth getting. You get two very detailed career retrospectives on John Garfield and Lana Turner which on their own are worth the price of the Bluray. If you are super-fans of the two stars, there may not be a lot on the docs you don't already know, but for newbies they are a good history lesson and offer some interesting tidbits.",1504396800,,497,4.354838709677419
