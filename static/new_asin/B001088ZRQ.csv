Their parents, naturally enough, disapprove, and try various means to end their relationship.  Manga, who comes from a poor family, must undergo traditional rites to 'heal' him of his homosexuality, while Soli's wealthy father first keeps Soli under his eye working for him at his business, then packs him off to the countryside, and compels him to marry so the family name will not be dragged down.  But 'Dakan' means destiny, and Soli and Manga are destined to be together...

Dakan is an arthouse film in the best sense of the word: it is often still, and quiet, with not much dialogue, and in the gaps one's own thoughts and feelings rush in to create a meditative intensity.  It is also, in its quiet way, an epic gay romance: the protagonists have to overcome - or defy - the broad opprobrium of the entire society, the intensity of their dilemma magnified by both being only sons, & so carriers of the family name and bloodline.  Contrast this with what gay characters in most Western gay romances are having to deal with...

One interesting thing about the film is that Soli and Manga are both popular with their schoolmates (boys and girls), all of whom know that they are in love with each other, but treat it as amusing - even sweet - rather than becoming bullying or vindictive towards them.  Neither Christianity nor Islam intrude into the narrative; if anything the opposition is between tradition and modernity.

Very convincing performances from the (I have to say extremely brave & committed) young leads make the viewer believe that their love will overcome whatever life throws at them.  While the love-scene with Oumu, a white girl Manga becomes involved with, is more explicit than the scenes between Manga and Soli, the passion with which the two boys kiss successfully conveys where the real emotional - and sexual - intensity lies.

The dvd is a clean widescreen transfer, with optional English subtitles.  It comes with two other shorts by the writer-director, a rather touching and pacey half-hour film about a young boy ostracised from village life, and a strange fifteen minute piece about a young blind man in search of his first sexual encounter.  Both the short films were made in Guinea, and are only subtitled in French.",1201132800,11,2390,4.78345498783455
