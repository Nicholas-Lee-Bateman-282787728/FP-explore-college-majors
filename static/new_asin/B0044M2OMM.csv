4261195,2,B0044M2OMM,I purchased  Topper  Volume  3  for  $ 7.69.  It is okay if you have never purchased the Topper series but a while back I bought  TV Classics  THE ADVENTURES OF TOPPER  for only  $ 3.99  which  has 9 episodes.  Volume 3  only has 3  episodes  and  2 episodes out of the  3 are in the other DVD.  there is a  bonus episode of Joe  Palooka  which I didn't think is very good.  Buy the  ADVENTURES OF TOPPER.  Is is a lot cheaper and a lot better.,1341964800,33,444,3.883720930232558

4261207,1,B0044M2OMM,"Beware of the DVD TV episodes from Alpha Video. They only give you 3 or 4 episodes per (overpriced) disc and Alpha has the absolute worst quality on these public domain shows - not that others have much better quality, but Alpha's the worst.

4261244,3,B0044M2OMM,"It's been decades since I have seen Topper on TV. As someone else stated this is Only Three episodes - and I'll add full of imperfections and NOT restored, and is in Black & White. There are no 'Bonus' features other than 'Joe Palooka' (also Black & White) - some stupid boxing story about 'Joe' going to Mexico to fight - and NOTHING to do with Topper. This DVD should be like in a discount bin for $2.00. The show itself is pretty good given the time period (1950's?). Scott M.",1364860800,2,479,4.274725274725275

8416115,5,B0044M2OMM,"I grew up with watching Topper and although I don't remember the episodes, I remember Leo G. Carroll and Neil the dog.
