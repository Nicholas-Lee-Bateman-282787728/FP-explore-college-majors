8630952,5,B00H8P6SX8,"I basically spent my formidable teen years in the 1980s. I turned 13 in November 1979. We finally saw the end of the '70s and it's flashy styles and music for the most part with a little leftover but began ""phasing it out"". A new decade of New Wave music and some good sitcoms, not to mention 1980s movies by director John Hughes. He made some of the best movies and captured pretty much what was going on in that time period with ""Sixteen Candles"", starring Molly Ringwald. Now, here is where she comes in. When this first season aired, Molly Ringwald was one of the gals that attended Eastland Academy, a private girls school. Another notable was Felice Schachter. You can see her in one early '80s movie called ""Zapped"" starring Scott Baio and Heather Thomas.

The series starts off with a ""crossover"" episode called ""Rough Housing"" in which Mrs. Garrett played by Charlotte Rae, takes a job at Eastland School and leaves The Drummond residence from ""Diff'rent Strokes"". All the cast from that show have cameos as they come over to Eastland for awhile to visit Mrs. Garrett.
 The episodes are ~
ROUGH HOUSING
LIKE MOTHER LIKE DAUGHTER
THE RETURN OF MR. GARRETT
I.Q.
OVERACHIEVING
EMILY DICKINSON
MOLLY'S HOLIDAY
DIETING
ADOPTION
RUNNING
FACTS OF LOVE
FLASH FLOOD
DOPE (last episode with the 4 gals together with original 3 that would continue into the series.)

Sadly, after the initial season, Molly, Felice, Julie Ann Haddock, and Julie Piekarski were let go from the show to focus on the remaining three students and one newcomer, Jo played by Nancy McKeon.
There are no other special features other than the episodes themselves, but they looked good and sounded good for a 30 year plus sitcom that started in 1979.  When I started watching this show I had a teen crush on Lisa Whelchel. Oh yeah. lol",1430784000,3,1806,4.723809523809524
