8341703,1,B001TJ5V3C,"This A&E ""Biography"" ""Henry VIII: Scandals of a King"" is the same as the VHS/DVD listed separately here on Amazon as simply ""Biography: Henry VIII,"" so I hope to post this review and another quite like this on that site, because they are one and the same program, and potential buyers deserve to be fairly warned.  I admit that I'm a bit hard on the A&E Biographies Series, because they tend to buy audience interest (if not titillation) at the cost of historical accuracy.  But this one, friends, is among the worst in A&E's arsenal if you want something besides pure fiction or, worse, ignorant drivel.  I am particularly frightened that one of the reviewers says s/he shows this to high school classrooms-- yikes.  It is so filled with inaccuracies and blatant disregard for factuality that the only way it should be viewed is with an instructor who can point out to the class where the vast liberties are being taken, or where the glossing over the facts are happening, or where the program is simply piling up a load of steaming, ummm, hogwash.

The problems begin with some big historical inaccuracies, stemming from a research staff who I can only assume don't know how to interpret historical evidence of the Renaissance time period: for a small example, we are told that upon the death of Henry's former wife, Catherine, Henry and Anne Boleyn danced about in bright yellow clothing, a blatant display of disrespect if not delight that the old bag was dead.  Well, the fact is that they did dress in yellow, but they did so because at that time in Spain (Catherine's homeland, where she was royalty), yellow was the color of mourning. So, it wasn't a blatant display of disrespect but actually an attempt to show respect in Catherine's own cultural language.

The most egregious problem in this program is that it is interspersed with a snooty, male, British voice narrating his personal recollections as if Henry VIII's diaries are being read:  for example, something like, ""I looked upon Arthur's dying body there in the bed, and I suddenly realized why our father had been talking to me so much lately.  My older brother was going to die.  My God!  I was going to be King one day!""  And down in the lower corner of the screen, the source is visibly shown as ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII.""  I once showed this video to a university class, stopped it after several of these narrative intrusions, and asked the students what they thought this voiceover was signifying or was giving us. They all said the video was leading us to believe that Henry VIII had left some diaries of some sort and these readings were small excerpts from his diaries. When I told them that ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII"" is a fictional novel by Margaret George, and that NOWHERE in the program is it ever explained that ""The Autobiography of Henry VIII"" is a completely fictional work (even though Margaret George is interviewed many times as an ""expert"" or ""scholar"" in this show, but it's never revealed exactly what this book IS), the students were outraged that ""Biography"" had led us to believe we were being given historical material of some sort.

And if you look for reviews of this novel, as I just did on Goodreads, you'll find a majority of 4- and 5-star reviews gush on and on about Margaret George's ""meticulous historical research and accuracy"" and ""thorough and accurate depictions of Henry's inner world"" and such.  How would these readers know if George's book held historical accuracy?  Do they have degrees in history?  No, they probably read about her ""meticulous historical research"" on the dust-jacket, and as for the thoroughness with which she depicts Henry's inner world, you can't quarrel with 900 pages as far as ""thorough"" goes, but how on earth could anyone judge the accuracy of her depiction of his inner world?

This is one of the great problems with our media-driven world:  one totally fabricated ""history"" contributes material to this ""Biography"" in a dramatic voice and convincing manner that then perpetuates in this ""historical"" video a set of ""facts"" that never existed in the first place.  And who takes the time to read a true scholar's biography when we have so many wonderful television programs that can entertain us while (supposedly) educating us?

This entire program appears to me to have been written and produced by a group of middle-school students. No, forgive me; I've no reason to insult middle-school students.  The complete ineptitude of the material presented in this program is appalling.  I hope that if anybody reading this has any notion of showing this to classrooms, I've helped you see that the only good use of this video would be as an example of the folly of assuming that televised ""educational"" programs are all created equal:  do your own research so that you can use this video to help your students see how amazingly erroneous television history programs can be.  That may be a better educational lesson than anything else we can teach them.",1408406400,,5004,4.817757009345795
