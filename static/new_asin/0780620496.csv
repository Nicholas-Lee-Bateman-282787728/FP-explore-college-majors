If you feel like sipping red wine and enjoying Tuscan warmth, the flavour of Italy, the glow of Olive fields and golden stone towns, cheerful trattorias and eccentric  Italians you will revel in this film.  The atmosphere of a small Italian  town is delicious and the plot is a joy.  It made me laugh, it made me cry  and it left me feeling very good.

I was rewarded with a warm comedy about two people who deeply love each other, and have what seems to be an insurmountable problem to  cope with, with regards Roseanna's last wish. A funny very enjoyable film  with, a great cast that causes you to look past some of the small problems  with the story: ie Roseanna only looks more beautiful as the story  progresses.

35495,5,0780620496,"I am not going to discuss the plot since it has been provided by others. My love for this movie is mainly based on the devotion the two main characters have for each other, the back stories, and the visual beauty of nearly all of the scenes. And, of course, the way it weaves humor into a theme based on tragedy.

Reno as Marcello does an excellent job of portraying a somewhat clumsy, obsessive character who has a heart of gold and a bent for mischief. Ruehl's character, Roseanna, is the perfect foil to Marcello and every bit his soul mate. Her sister, Cecilia (Poly Walker) is temperamental and fiery (and Walker's Italian is excellent). There are others in the story who are mainly there to provide back stories - one humorous and the other bitter - as well as to support the main story.

To me the scenery is as much a star as the actors. The small Italian town is simply beautiful and captured as almost art in scene after scene. Even the trattoria owned by Marcello and Rosanna had a rustic, authentic quality that made you feel as though you were in it. If I had to pick any one scene as memorable it would be the opening one where the surreal visual of a tightrope walker dropping flowers on a coffin below, timed with the priest's prayer verses, sticks in my mind and epitomizes art. Of course, that scene sets the stage for the laughs, smiles and tears that follow to the feel-good and funny ending.

If you love quirky comedies with a range of emotion and beautiful cinematography you will probably love this movie.",1445731200,2,1529,4.473118279569892

I also love that these characters are middle aged, married for years, and still in love.  It's not wishy-washy; they have had life through them a few curves.

35594,5,0780620496,"""For Roseanna"" is a wonderfully sweet romantic comedy about a loving husband and his devotion to his dying wife. The film is full of charismatic performances, but Jean Reno steals the show by a narrow margin. Mercedes Ruehl is also warm and lovely in the title role. For a story so focused on the subject of death, the character of Marcello is the embodiment of vitality, and his various efforts to keep his fellow townsmen alive so they don't take up the last graves in the village cemetery are hilarious. Having seen Reno more typically in dramatic roles in movies such as ""The Professional,"" ""Mission: Impossible,"" and ""Ronin,"" I was impressed with the very gifted comic range that he demonstrates here. With very fine talented supporting performances from Polly Walker, Trevor Peacock, Renato Scarpa, Roberto Della Casa, and Mark Frankel (tragically, his final performance), this is a little jewel of a movie.

35595,5,0780620496,"I've been a fan of Jean Reno since '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Big-Blue/dp/B00004TWZF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Big Blue</a>' and I honestly cannot think of any poor or lousy film he's been in - save for one unfortunate scifi-schlock retread. But you can't hit a home run at every bat. And even then - he was one of the few bright spots in that forgettable flick.

'For Roseanna' is a wonderfully sweet dark comedy about Marcello (Reno) a small town restauranteur desperate to honor his terminally ill wife's last wish: To be buried next to their daughter in the tiny town cemetery. The problem? There are only three plots left and there are already two very aged residents on their death beds.

Marcello will do *anything* to insure that no one else takes that final resting place from his wife. No one.

Unfortunately, fate comically intervenes and suddenly there are dead bodies piling up everywhere! :-D

Loved the tricky opening scene! I feared that I was about to watch some asinine art-house movie about the ubiquitous ""Sad European Clowns"" - God save me from the pretentious cirqu and hit the fast forward. But just as quickly, you realize something very odd about Reno's character, and the laughs never stop from there.

A very tender and sweet love story that happens to occur amongst the hilarious unexpected demise of several townsfolk and one hellaciously focused old criminal.

I suppose the one knock I have against this excellent film - the accents. Only Reno, whose generic European, passes for Italian-accented English. The always enjoyable Polly Walker's UK accented Italian is only mildly off-mark. But Mercedes Ruehl and her New Yawk accent... ugh. But since no one in the main cast actually is Italian and no one is actually speaking Italian, all can be forgiven since the story told is so awesome.

And wow, I had forgotten how stunningly handsome&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mark-Frankel-ignore-the-creepy-dvd-cover-artwork/dp/0782009123/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mark Frankel (ignore the creepy dvd cover artwork)</a>&nbsp;was; today's audience really lost out when he died at such a young age (34yrs) and at a time when his career was just about to take off.

Roseanna (Mercedes Ruehl) has a congenital heart condition that will take her life sooner rather than later, and a heartfelt wish to be buried next to  her deceased daughter in the village cemetery. The cemetery, however, is filling up, with only three spaces left. So Reno's task is to do everything he can, fair but nearly foul, if necessary, to prevent anyone else dying.

35626,5,0780620496,"I thoroughly enjoyed this delightful little gem of a romantic comedy. The actors were very good, especially Jean Reno as Marcello and Mercedes Ruehl as Roseanna. They were a perfect match and believable as a happily married couple (they even argued lovingly, if you can believe that).  One of the reviewers couldn't understand why everyone spoke English everywhere except in the cemetary. I am not remotely fluent in Italian, but I think the Catholic priest was speaking Latin during the burials. It seemed fitting. At times, though, I did have some trouble understanding what some of the other actors were saying due to their heavily Italian accented English.

After reading the reviews here on amazon, I bought the DVD intending to sit down with my wife on our weekly ""video viewing Staurday evening together"", but couldn't resist taking a peek at the beginning of ""For Roseanna.""

OK, two totally different movies (and I liked Chasing Amy when I eventually saw it) but I've always been grateful to him for recommending For Roseanna.  I've never understood why it wasn't more popular ... perhaps lack of exposure/advertising.  In any case, I eventually located it on VHS 3 or 4 years ago from an Amazon partner ... but have always wondered why it never made the jump to DVD considering all the other obscure crap (and I do mean crap) that did get DVD transfers.  I even sent an email to the studio/production company about it (and, predictably, heard nothing back).

I came across ""For Roseanna"" years ago on cable and never forgot it. When I fianlly found it on video, I showed it to all of my friends who in turn have then showed it to all of their friends. It's a film for everyone and it never fails to impress. If you are looking for a pleasant surprise, this is it.",1135036800,3,434,4.117647058823529
35629,5,0780620496,"It is very enjoyable to see Jean Reno  playing the helpless, stressed out guy who deeply loves his wife and tries very hard to fulfill all her desires especially her last one...

On the same time it is refreshing to see a married man, on the big screen, that after years of marriage has passion for his wife, is deeply in love with her, and remains loyal,despite the temptations that are lurking around.

The opening scene of the movie sets the mood for what will follow: The funeral of an acrobat while circus artists perform at the cemetry. A really GREAT inspiration from the director. All this poetic introduction is embraced with a beatyful melancholic song titled ""Luna Rosa"".

This movie has also great laughs particullary when the people that know Jean Reno's desire scare him with very innovative ways.

The location where the movie was shot is  excellent, a small village somewhere in Italy, and the end is incredibly impredictable.

Finally it is great they decided to change the title. Interestingly when it was played in Greece the title was ""Anything for Roseanne"".

Watch this movie with the one you love, either for many years, or for a short time. You will really enjoy it.",1130198400,,1190,4.742718446601942
35647,5,0780620496,"Same thing: watched it on VHS ages ago (1999?) and have been looking for it ever since.  I think the title was actually ""Roseanna's Grave"" once.  Funny how they (may have) changed the title to a more positive one.

The movie is beatiful - not a tinge of cheesiness despite the storyline.  Watch it.  The thing I loved the most is that the movie was done in English.  Funny how Jean Reno and the rest of the actors  had to squezze all of that passion into the confines of a foreign language!  The part that was left over went straight into body language.  That was beautiful.  Again, highly recommended.",1129507200,,602,4.440366972477064
35648,5,0780620496,"I was hunting for this movie for a long time. I am a big fan of Jean Reno and had seen the movie previously on VHS, but forgot the title and therefore had some problems tracking it down on DVD. All this was not in vain - the movie was as wonderful and sweet as I remembered it. It's very difficult to define its genre - it's a cocktail of comedy and drama, mixed together almost equally.  The story seems to be a bit macabre from the first glance - Marcello (Jean Reno), the owner of a small restaurant in a sleepy little town somewhere in Italy, has promised his dying wife Roseanna (Mercedes Ruehl) that he will bury her in the old town cemetery upon her death, so she could be together with their only little daughter, who died a long time ago. Unfortunately, there are only very few plots left in the old cemetery and it can not be expanded, because the owner of the adjacent land is refusing to sell a parcel of it to accommodate the extension (mostly out of spite to Marcello, which makes negotiations even more difficult). And the new cemetery will be far away, on a hill above the town. But Marcello loves his wife very much and he's made her a promise - and so he races against time, trying to keep the town's inhabitants alive - by any means, from directing a busy Sunday traffic near the church (so nobody got hurt) to giving his blood to an old man dying at the hospital, in the vain hope this will prolong his life. His life is dedicated to this goal - but as life always has its twists and turns- not everything goes smoothly for Marcello, though in the end he will get what he wants - and more. The cast is very good, Jean Reno and Mercedes Ruehl are very natural and endearing in their roles of a loving husband and wife, who, in all the tragedy that has befallen them, still had not forgotten how to live and love and enjoy the life, whenever they can, while it lasts. I liked the supporting actors -  Polly Walker in the role of Cecilia, Roseanna's independent, strong-willed sister, who is falling in love with Antonio (Mark Frankel), the nephew of Marcello's worst enemy, even as Roseanna is trying to do some matchmaking for her and Marcello, for that time when she'll be gone. Sadly, I believe this was the last movie for Mark Frankel, who did in a car accident shortly after the movie was released.

The rest of the cast even in the smallest roles are adding very much to the very romantic and very Italian atmosphere of the movie. They all even speak with the accent (which might be uncomfortable for some viewers, though I personally thought it's a nice touch!).

The DVD extra features are very few - a theatrical trailer, plus New Line promotional trailers and a DVD-ROM with the links to the New Line promotions.",1128211200,7,2740,4.3772102161100195
35649,5,0780620496,"For Roseanna is a comical, clean, and, yes, manly love-story. Marcello portrays the dedication every man should have to his wife ailing or not. My wife and I enjoyed this movie very much and will continue to do so for many years.",1123459200,2,229,4.476190476190476
35650,5,0780620496,"This is a lovely movie. It was originally entitled ""Roseanna's Grave"". In its offbeat way, it tells of the love between a middle-aged man and his dying wife.  Marcello, played by Jean Reno, has made a promise to his ailing wife, Roseanna (Mercedes Ruehl). He will make sure that when she dies, she will be buried next to their beloved child. Despite the rapidly diminishing number of plots in the town's overcrowded cemetery, he intends to keep his promise. He goes to great, even absurd lengths, to ensure that the other townsfolk do not die first and deprive his wife of that last available plot. When one of Marcello's friends dies in an accident, he hides the body in a freezer. When the family of a man declared brain-dead wants to turn off his life support, he pretends to hear the man speak. He fusses constantly over the health of all the townsfolk. It may all sound rather morbid but the film plays out very sweetly and with a gentle humour that often brims over into hilarity. His equally devoted wife meanwhile tries to pair him off with her younger sister, Cecilia, played by the lovely Polly Walker (Enchanted April). Unfortunately they can't stand each other. A little twist at the end allows the couple to live out one last dream before the final curtain call. It is an uplifting ending and one that will leave you smiling.

It's rare to come across a movie that brings you close to tears one moment and have you laughing with joy the next. And though it does not pretend to conquer death, it does push its characters to live life to the fullest. For all the laughter and light-hearted comedy, it is the film's portrayal of the love between the aging couple that makes this charming comedy special.

Although this is an American production, it is set in Italy, the cast is mainly Italian and it has a very Italianate feel to it. It is almost like watching an Italian film. It certainly doesn't feel like something coming out of Hollywood. ""For Roseanna"" was filmed in the lovely hill country around Sermoneta in central Italy. The photography is gorgeous.

New Line Home Entertainment has produced a fine DVD with a lovely transfer in the film's original 2.35:1 widescreen (anamorphic). It also includes a fullscreen pan-&-scan version. Picture quality in the widescreen version is lovely. Crisp, clear and generally clean with only very occasional nicks on the print. Colors are bright and natural. Black levels are just right. Sound is in the original English Dolby 5.1 and a dubbed Spanish Dolby 5.1. There are optional English and Spanish subtitles. Aside from the theatrical trailer there are no other extras. Still it's worth the price just to be able to watch this seldom-seen, almost unheard of little treat. It's good to know that Hollywood, in between its multi-million-dollar blockbusters, can still make such little gems.",1120953600,18,2848,4.794297352342159

And make sure you catch the very last line - its one of the best closers for a movie in years.  And for the love story - the last name of Jean Reno's character says it all.

35655,4,0780620496,"This is the kind of movie a wide range of people will enjoy. For a start, it taps into that ever popular theme of 'gentle comedy in small-town Italy'. If you've enjoyed 'Cinema Paradiso', 'Il Postino' or 'Life is Beautiful', you'll want to see this too. It has the same successful mix of scenery, music and eccentric characters. Watching this feels as though the wine bars and winding streets have come to your living room. Unlike the films just mentioned, however, this isn't really an Italian movie at all - it's all in English, with the characters affecting  Italian accents with varying degrees of success and authenticity. Still, the accents are not too grating - you get used to them quite quickly - and its easy to enter into the spirit of the movie's premise. It helps greatly that the location filming is superb. The town is shown in all its slightly shoddy beauty. Nothing seems 'tarted up' for the camera, and this gives the whole a sense of realism to counterbalance the admittedly incredible plot. While this is absolutely a comedy, with some very funny moments, there is still a serious undertone - it all revolves around the wishes of a dying woman. The pain of love, requited and unrequited, is explored most sensitively. There are moments that will bring you to tears.",974073600,,1285,4.736607142857143
