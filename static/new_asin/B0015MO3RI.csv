3145783,5,B0015MO3RI,you can't beat Mother Teresa.  Anything about her life is a wonderful view for the spiritually minded individual.  A must have for them.,1385683200,,136,4.869565217391305
3145784,5,B0015MO3RI,"I wanted a DVD of Mother Teresa.
Her story is very inspiring, some parts are sad.
She is a Saint alright.  Her love for human life,
caring attitude for the sick, poor and disabled
She was an amazing Missionary Nun, lots,
of guts intelligence, sacrificing, humble
but also aggressive when she wanted something.
I loaned it to a friend and she loves it.",1353974400,,351,4.571428571428571
3145785,5,B0015MO3RI,"This beautiful video combines a very long and profound talk with her with images of her in action and images of her funeral. Impressive to see her face, her full of love looks and to hear her voice together with subtitles in your language (mine is Spanish).

To reply to one of the dissapointed customers I must say that the funeral reflectes very well how much this little Albanian Catholic Nun had an impact in Indian people who crowd the streets of Calcutta to say the last thank you & farewell as well as to the dignataries of the world. Impressive & Surprising to see the category of State funeral for a woman, european, and catholic nun! ... who could't care less for human parafernalia.

We have had it in several group showings (with permission, of course) and more than half of the viewers came out in tears. 100% loved it!",1317513600,,832,4.503311258278146
3145786,3,B0015MO3RI,"The front cover of the DVD looks like it is a copied picture that was printed off of a computer. The DVD I am not sure if it was burned. I was a little disappointed that that wasn't totally communicated in the selling.

Thanks!

3145787,1,B0015MO3RI,This video was a great disappointment.  The whole thing keeps coming back to her funeral punctuated with snippets of her teachings.  But after every snippet of teaching there is a return to the funeral.  Really not very inspirational and quite a disappointment.  Her funeral events should not be the focus of such a movie.  Her legacy went beyond the funeral.,1294444800,6,359,4.916666666666667
3145788,5,B0015MO3RI,"A wonderful, very professional documentary of Mother Teresa's life. Not only does she speak but also her niece & members of her congregation that were close to her. I can't recommend it highly enough. A word of warning about ordering though. My copy was mailed in a thin cardboard envelope with no padding & the cover was totally smashed. I would request they at least bubble wrap it.",1264118400,9,384,4.661764705882353
3145789,5,B0015MO3RI,There aren't words for how touched I was in seeing Mother in this documentary. Gorgeous in every way. AMAZING!,1255305600,,110,4.842105263157895
3145790,5,B0015MO3RI,"In India, there is a word used to express the blessing conferred by seeing or touching a great or holy person. That word is ""darshan.""

I believe that I have experienced ""darshan"" from viewing the film Mother Teresa: The Legacy, the official film for the beatification of Mother Teresa.

Mother Teresa: The Legacy documents Mother Teresa's profound impact on the world as visibly demonstrated by a very special public state funeral in India attended by 8,000 people, including Hindu, Christian, Buddhist, Muslim and other religious leaders, political leaders of all persuasions and the rich and powerful from across the globe. The film also includes footage of Mother Teresa's private burial and clips of interviews with Mother Teresa in which she expresses her profound wisdom with simplicity and clarity.

Mother Teresa's works of love and selfless service affirmed the greatness and dignity of every human person and transcended religion and politics. This is why she was so widely embraced by people of all faiths and backgrounds.

Mother Teresa: The Legacy is the sequel to filmmakers Ann and Jeanette Petrie's stunning 1986 film Mother Teresa, which was filmed over a period of five years in 10 countries. That film was one of the most spiritually uplifting and moving films I have ever seen in my life. I was brought to tears during that film as well as during Mother Teresa: The Legacy.

If you are seeking spiritually exalting movies, be sure to get both of these movies and be bathed in the love of one of the most spiritually- exalted women ever to walk the earth. The life of Mother Teresa bore the fruit of a total and unconditional surrender to the path of love and service through action. And that fruit was so powerful that it has touched the whole world. More than a quarter million people flooded St. Peter's Square in Rome for Mother Teresa's beatification on October 19, 2003. And her Missionaries of Charity carry on her work at shelters, orphanages and clinics in over 100 countries that are dedicated to caring for those forsaken by everyone else. Mother Teresa's work and example has touched the lives of millions of people and the world is a better place because of her.",1217462400,24,2195,4.889784946236559
