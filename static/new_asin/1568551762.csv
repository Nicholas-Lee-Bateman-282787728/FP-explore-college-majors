Beautiful scenery. Can't wait to go!",1183766400,,170,4.181818181818182
7796970,4,1568551762,"Rick Steves does an excellent job of capturing what it feels like to travel through Germany, with plenty of hands-on details that I wish I'd learned before my first trip. (For example, he shows you how the train system works, which ameliorates the intimidation factor.)
We winced, however, every time he pronounced something in German. Trier's pronounced Treeeeer, Steve, not Try-er. It's okay with me if he's a monoglot (so am I), but if you're educating folks about a country, at least get the names right.
Don't let that quibble distract you from the value of this video. I learned quite a bit about both the Mosel/Rhine area and Rothenberg, and I'd spent a few days there (saddled down with guidebooks) on my last trip.",1017187200,8,723,4.792
