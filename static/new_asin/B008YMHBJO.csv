5191187,4,B008YMHBJO,"I enjoyed this DVD very much, but clocking in at about 51 minutes (the box says 49, but the DVD player said 51 and some change before the credits), it's a bit short.

It basically details the big bang theory, and a few rival interpretations of them, leading always back to the same conclusions based upon everything we know about physics.

If you're looking for a gift for a science-lover, you could do far worse than this.",1353196800,6,423,4.48051948051948
5191188,5,B008YMHBJO,"I watched a version of this that I borrowed from my library and now will buy it. Very well done. Cogent, sharp, thoughtful. I also enjoyed the explanations of the various theories (I'm a science fan, especially science fiction). I recommend this for any age group.",1349049600,9,264,4.760869565217392
5191189,4,B008YMHBJO,"This film explores all of the theories about the origin of the universe. The scientists interviewed to explain the theories are credible, even though some are difficult to understand because of heavy accents. Arno Pensius is especially accurate when he explains that any scientist can invent a theory and then it becomes the responsibility of others to disprove it. If you love physics and science you will love this film. If you have ever trully wondered where and how it all began you will appreciate the metaphysics aspect. I purchased one copy from another source and am ordering a second copy to give to a friend.",1348876800,11,618,4.839622641509434
5191190,5,B008YMHBJO,I found this video blended religious belief and scientific belief much better than Cosmos. Cosmic Origins is the best video I have viewed.,1404172800,,138,5.043478260869565
5191191,3,B008YMHBJO,"People knowledgeable about logic and the difference between inductive and deductive reasoning will find plenty of fallacious arguments in this presentation.  For just one example, while discussing the theory of a bouncing universe, they make the comparison to a ball bouncing on earth, and how each bounce is smaller than the previous one - and then they make the jump that a bouncing universe theory is false because each subsequent universe, they argue, would have less and less energy, just like the bouncing ball . Anyone else see the problem here?  You can't apply the laws of physics and gravity that we observe in THIS universe to a bouncing universe model that exists OUTSIDE of our observable universe.

They also spent a lot of screen time talking about the odds and probability of this or that thing happening, and that the odds are so remote, there must be a ""designer"" putting all of this into place for us to be here.  Most people will recognize this as a form of the ""god of the gaps"" argument.  Why the creators of this video did not, I don't know.  Given an infinite amount of time, anything that IS probable will eventually happen, so I'm not concerned if the odds of something happening are 10^10^123 - given enough time, it's going to happen, without any supernatural intervention.

Given all of the reasons offered by this video, even if there is an Intelligent Designer, how you arrive at needing to become a Christian is beyond me.  A deist maybe; but not anything beyond that.  The church has already lost the argument on Adam and Eve, and without them and Original Sin, the whole house of cards for Christianity falls tumbling down.",1399334400,,1657,4.7456445993031355
5191192,3,B008YMHBJO,The background music was overpowering the voices which made it hard to hear what was being said. Image quality wasn't that good either.,1370822400,,135,4.913043478260869
5191193,3,B008YMHBJO,"The content is very interesting, but the delivery leaves a lot to be desired.  I bought it hoping I could share it with my high school religious education class (Confirmation) but after previewing it, it didn't seem like a good idea.  Make sure you have an adult audience with a sincere interest and appreciation for the topic.",1370390400,,327,4.719298245614035
5191194,5,B008YMHBJO,"Outstanding presentation by a team of physicists regarding the unlikelyhood that the universe, and us, are here by chance.  Very understandable.",1370044800,2,144,5.857142857142857
5191195,5,B008YMHBJO,This is a very good DVD.  This is one of the more explanatory videos of our time. I think it does well to build a common ground between science and belief in creation.  Both are true.,1369699200,4,183,4.055555555555555
5191196,5,B008YMHBJO,"This is an outstanding video that presents the scientific case for a created universe. It lucidly explains the science and is laced with commentary from some of the worlds leading cosmologist and physicists. It is graphically appealing and makes highly technical material understandable.

I'd suggest reading Father Spitzers book ""New Proof for the Existence of God"" as well. Its a much deeper discussion of information that can only be lightly addressed in a video.

This is an excellent video for both scientifically and spiritually oriented audiences. Enjoy",1367539200,5,560,5.425287356321839
5191197,5,B008YMHBJO,"This presentations provides factual information to the formation of the universe which highlights the statement, ""how impossible the odds are that the universe have developed by random chance.""",1366588800,3,193,5.928571428571429
5191198,4,B008YMHBJO,"I'm not sure who this video for.  Adults? College students? Atheists? I teach high school students, and while the video is good, and there are interviews with young people, it's my opinion that for high school students,it lacks in two ways.  One, points that you want to make have to be made extremely clear.  And in this case, while I understood the video, I think the clarity of the case for God's intelligent design got a little lost in all the other theories (which is tragic, because I was pretty impressed that video addressed these theories).  And two, while the video's images are good (save maybe the artistic depiction of what came flying out of the ""big bang""), my students went to sleep during the video.  I understand that not all students are wild about science, but starting a video with a priest speaking in his library talking for five minutes... Even then I had to talk so students wouldn't start closing their eyes.

So again, maybe good for college students and adults, but for my students, I'll probably go back to a PBS video on the creation of the universe, and just fill in the blanks.  But I'm certainly not complaining about any content in this program, just the clarity of the issues.",1365638400,2,1211,4.630841121495327
5191199,5,B008YMHBJO,This is a great video. So many youth are being told bald-faced lies by people like Richard Dawkins who wrap a veneer of pseudo-science around the junk they are peddling. This video presents a straightforward approach that makes the logical conclusion that our scientific understanding points to the existence of God and is not in conflict with faith.,1356998400,9,350,5.051724137931035
