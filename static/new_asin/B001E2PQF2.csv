8296145,1,B001E2PQF2,There was less than kind language and a gun for some reason in this snowboarding video.  Mistake to buy for a 6 year old.,1395532800,,121,4.041666666666667
8296146,2,B001E2PQF2,"Overall really lame movie unless you're in love with Shaun White. Nothing spectacular or original about this film. Yes, he may be the best halfpipe rider on the planet, but that doesn't make for an interesting movie, if you want that then watch Olympic reruns. If you want to watch a great snowboard film go watch Travis Rice shred in a Brain Farm movie like That's it that's all or The Art of Flight. Shaun White's movie will put you to sleep, zzzzzz....",1367020800,,455,4.493975903614458
8296147,5,B001E2PQF2,"I really enjoyed this film because you get to see Shaun, and other pro snowboarders, just having fun. They all head to Japan to take a ""breather"" and just snowboard for fun and just do what they wanted to do! I also loved seeing them all act just like normal guys their age (buying air-soft guns and randomly attacking each other with them, making jumps in snow covered streets out of boredom...). It makes you wish you were out there with them!",1331078400,,445,4.439024390243903
8296148,3,B001E2PQF2,"Not a bad video. Documentary about Shawn going to Japan. More narration than I thought, not enough actual snowboarding. But, the powder footage is pretty good.",1324339200,,159,5.153846153846154
8296149,5,B001E2PQF2,"My almost 7 year old grandson watched this video 5 times in 24 hours while on a ski/snowboard vacation with us.  Shaun is his hero. My grandson asked for the video for his 7th birthday and all the kids at his party were captivated.  Having skied all my life, I was in awe watching the skills of the boarders and enjoying the vicarious thrill of snowriding in such an amazing setting.  This video appeals to all ages. I highly recommend it.",1273104000,,439,4.395061728395062
8296150,5,B001E2PQF2,"I bought this DVD for my grandson for his birthday, so he would have to rate it. I can say, however, that it arrived timely for me to send it to him and appeared to be in perfect condition.",1272931200,,189,3.871794871794872
8296151,2,B001E2PQF2,"I love snowboarding, I love Japan, and I like Shaun White so I thought a video about all these things would be awesome. Unfortunately, I was wrong. First of all, the whole thing runs less than an hour and only in the middle third are they actually in Japan. It starts off talking about how Shaun is out of his element in the backcountry and it ends with his win at the 2008 US Open in Stratton. If those are of interest to you fine, but I wanted to see some serious footage of his time in Japan and I don't think it lasts more than thirty minutes. Secondly, although you get to hear plenty of Shaun talking and people talking about Shaun, you don't really see more than a handful of shots of Shaun actually snowboarding. A lot of the footage is of his friends who are along for the trip. Also, since we are in Japan, why doesn't the video spend much time exploring the culture, the food, and the uniqueness of the country that would make a trip there fun and exciting? If you want to see a great ski/snowboarding video about Japan, go to evogear.com and stream Nimbus Independent's ""En Route - Japan"". Best of all, it's FREE!!!",1235088000,7,1127,4.320754716981132
8296152,5,B001E2PQF2,"This movie rules! I was so stoked that Shaun is out of his element in Japan. Such good pow riding and awesome footage from when he was a little kid. I can't believe how far he has come! If you like Shaun, this will open your eyes and you will love him!",1226880000,,252,3.8653846153846154
