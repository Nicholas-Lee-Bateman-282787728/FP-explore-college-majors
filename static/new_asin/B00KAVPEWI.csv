6411423,5,B00KAVPEWI,"This latest movie from American Girl is the gift you give to your daughter, granddaughter, or niece who loves ballet and dance, because Isabelle not only dances into the spotlight but also on the screen for most of the film! While the previous two American Girl movies of recent years focused on a specific talent (gymnastics with McKenna and painting with Saige), this one really, really focuses on ballet, so ballet students will feel right at home with all the dancing, ballet terms, rehearsals, and of course, the production of The Nutcracker (which any and all dancers could probably do in their sleep). For non-ballerina girls, it's still good fun, but ballet girls will especially enjoy and identify with it.

The production is very handsome and colorful, this being director Vince Marcello's third consecutive outing with American Girl. It looks and feels very much like McKenna and Saige, which means there are plenty of giggle scenes and lots and lots of sweetness, quite a bit more than in the earlier AG films that were based on the historical dolls.

Yes, some could comment on the sugary approach or the giggle dialogue, but here's the deal. American Girl is one of the only companies in the known world producing clean, wholesome, innocent entertainment for children. I am very glad they continue to dance in the spotlight with fun and suitable family viewing. It's sweet and heartfelt, and our children need as much of that as they can get. Thanks, AG!",1405987200,42,1468,4.891566265060241

6411454,5,B00KAVPEWI,"I danced for years, and now my daughter is taking classes at one of the US's top ballet schools, where many classes are taught by dancers as well known as this film's top dancer is in their universe.  Let me first get my fairly petty criticisms out of the way, though this first isn't as petty as it first seems, and then get to why this movie still gets five stars.

It felt like they really wanted to emphasize the Palmer family's wealth in a rather extreme manner.  Their home is so massive that it makes my 2400sq.ft. home feel tiny.  Ballet already has a big problem of classes being attainable to those who have more means, primarily wealthier white families (I saw this as a white woman) and out of reach to those with less (primarily non-white families), though a lot of schools are making concerted efforts to pull in students with lower means through scholarships.  I would have liked to see a more middle class family portrayed instead of one that lives in a mansion so huge that my entire house could fit in their kitchen.  It was also pounded in that the (very young) dad is a hospital administrator and in a lucrative band while the (also very young) mother is a glass designer, fashion designer, and antique garment restorer for the Smithsonian.  Basically this is a family that pretty much no one can identify with.  I say this as someone who is now a fashion designer who restores antique gowns on the side (the way it was show in the movie would NEVER be done, EVER).  This is a family my daughter and I can't identify with.

(The mother is also hired to costume the Nutcracker production, but no work starts on it until the last couple weeks before the show.  In real life, the costumes would have been done by then except for last-minute fitting tweaks.  I know.  I've costumed productions.)

The other criticism, which probably wouldn't have been noticed by anyone who hasn't lived immersed in the dance world, and is sill very much in it, is that the full names of companies and their locations were used.  ""School of American Ballet in New York City"" isn't what would be said every time that school is mentioned.  ""I'd love to take classes as the School of American Ballet in New York City!"" would be said, ""I'd live to take classes at the ABT!""  In the dance world, the full name and location is a given.  But in this movie, no one seems to know and always seems to be reminded.  This did essen as the movie went on.

I can easily let slide how fourth-graders, who are typically nine or ten, wouldn't realistically be cast in a professional Nutcracker as snowflakes or flowers.  I was very relieved that they weren't shoving pointe shoes on kids that young.  There's a major problem of dance schools rushing to get kids into pointe shoes before the bones in their feet have ossified enough, which is very dangerous.  This is why those YouTube videos of little kids in pointe shoes, whose ankles are often visibly too weak, aren't cute.  This movie, but not doing that, doesn't encourage that, which is a relief.

So with that, I'll start some of the positives.  In addition to not putting children into pointe shoes (teen and older dancers are in pointes, which is fine), this movie emphasizes working hard.  In one early scene, Isabelle asks her sister, Jade, why she has been practicing for hours when she's so good already, and Jade tells her that you have to work hard and for a long time to really be good at something, and compared it to the sewing Isabelle loves to do.  A lot of young dancers, my daughter included, wonder why they have to keep doing the same things over and over even when they get bored of the same moves.

This movie deals with self-doubt.  Every child has it, no matter what.  It'll happen.  But children need the message reinforced that you need to try again, and that missing steps or doing something wrong doesn't mean giving up.  Try again, and then try again, and you'll get it.  My daughter needed to see Isabelle missing some steps in an early performance in the movie.  After the performance, Isabelle told a young child who wanted er autograph that she messed up, and the little fan said she didn't even notice.  In reality, most people don't notice, yet every dancer worries about mistakes.  They aren't the end of the world.

Something I LOVE is the emphasis on enjoying what you're doing.  When the young dancers are enjoying what they're doing, they dance better.  When they stress and worry, that's when mistakes are more likely to happen.  As Isabelle said at one point, she was worrying so much that she thought she was going to mess up because she was worrying, and that's true.  When the kids are enjoying themselves, that makes them shine, regardless of imperfections in their steps.

And a lesson for the parents: In this movie, the Palmer parents take for granted their older daughter's high grades in class and dance abilities.  In one scene, she told them she got an A on a test, and her father said, literally verbatim, ""What's new?"" and turned his attention to his younger daughter and got excited that she was successful in a dance move.  That burned me.  I was the older sibling whose achievements were overlooked as a given, and that ultimately discouraged me from even trying.  Parents shouldn't downplay achievements just because one of their children often pull in top grades.  Parents need to continue congratulating their children for the work they're putting in, which often may be when no one is looking.

The parents' reactions to Jade's ""what's new?"" achievements fueled sibling rivalry.  In a particularly resonating scene, Isabelle explodes at her sister because she's tired of being compared to ""Miss Perfect.""  But Jade yells back at her how everything is about Isabelle's feelings because everyone expects Jade to be perfect and no one cares about her struggles and her need for encouragement.  And that's true.  It hurts when all the effort goes overlooked and is taken for granted.  Both girls have very valid feelings.  One is overlooked, and the other's work is taken for granted.  Their mother gives a bad response to that as ""your achievements don't matter to us if you're not happy,"" since she doesn't notice her daughter's achievements even when she's happy.  I wish that her mother (father's reaction not shown) would have been to acknowledge ignoring Jade's achievements.  She didn't say anything when her husband said, ""What's new?"" in response to that A.  I can't like the parents because of that.

The in-universe baller star, Jackie Sanchez, had a sweet moment with Isabelle, when Isabelle was at her lowest, where she disclosed her own dance troubles as a young student dancer, slipping and falling enough that she got a nickname for it.  Jackie told her the truth that ballet is hours and hours of dance, sore feet and bodies, and that there will always be better and faster dancers, but if you love it, that won't matter.  So this isn't another one of those movies that sets up the false expectation what working hard enough will make you the absolute very best.  It sets up a very touchingly realistic expectation.

The antagonist, Renata, is shown to be quite the bully and brat, and though this doesn't excuse her behavior, she's shown partway through as someone ignored by her parents.  They're more interested in their older son's football.  She and Isabelle do have an awkward make-up scene, which is about how it goes in real life.

I also love how much dance there is.  I've seen the Nutcracker literally dozens of times.  It's not unusual for me to go a dozen times in a single year.  So it was nice seeing some different choreography.  I know Balanchine's like the back of my hand, but the choreo used in this is lovely.

All in all, this is a surprisingly good movie that will be watched a lot on this house.",1465344000,,7831,4.65597667638484

I knew it would be worth buying as they still watch it again and again.  I like the American Girl movies, because they seem to explore relevant topics for young girls.  These movies are well-made, well-acted, topical, and good clean entertainment.

This one is good for anyone interested in dancing; however, it tackles topics that work for everyone in the tween range.  Sibling rivalry, how you can only succeed with a lot of hard work, and how you shouldn't ever be afraid to be yourself.  Is it great entertainment for mom?  Not necessarily, but I love the values it promotes and it certainly was better to watch than most movies geared toward young kids.",1454284800,5,779,4.635036496350365

6411470,3,B00KAVPEWI,"This is not one of the better American Girl movies.  The main character, Isabelle, is a younger sister who is very bratty and catered to.  She ends up coming around some, but never really takes ownership for how she treats other people, especially her sister.  The movie makes her older sister apologetic for being great at something she works really hard at.  The sister apologizes and sticks up for her, but again Isabelle, was not my favorite character.  I love the idea of ballet, but it does irk me that any movie or show that you see about Ballet today is only about the back-stabbing and competition factor with it at all ages.  This is not accurate for most girls who take ballet at a local studio and love dance.  Might be true for those traveling groups, but I think it is off-base with my ballet experience which was a true ballet-school.  There is another side, which is why kids fall in love with it in the first place.",1452384000,3,932,4.4733727810650885

But even that didn't get sense into her; it took some additional coddling from adults to get her back on track. While the antagonist was a bonafide mean girl, at least she practiced hard and faced more challenges. Isabelle showed minimal generosity in the movie despite characters referencing it. The movie's protoganist is really the big sister, though I wish she would smack more sense to Isabelle.",1449878400,,555,4.978494623655914

I had invested such a great amount of my personal time attempting to get a copy of the movie for my daughter to watch and she still has not seen this. This was an upsetting experience.  You could have released a digital copy to replace the one that was not working or anything to satisfy this customer.

6411518,2,B00KAVPEWI,"Not as good as other American Girl movies we've watched with the kids. The kids liked it, but it was pretty painful for us parents to watch. Isabelle is whiny and complaining with a victim, ""whoa is me"" attitude that gets old quick but persists throughout 90% of the movie. The happy, giggling family scenes, giggling silly girl scense and the fake falls had us rolling our eyes constantly. We expected the cafeteria, Fame-esque lunch scene, and it didn't disappoint. Eve expect it to be predictable, which I would've been find with. That I could stomach, but with the bad acting, whiny main character and annoyingly sugar-coated storyline it was really bad. We liked the horse Am. Girl movie (Felicity, I think?) but this one was awful. That said, my 8-year-old and 11-year-old girls, both of whom take dance,liked it. I wouldn't say they loved it, but they liked it (they just didn't like mommy and daddy making fun of it the whole time!).",1425340800,2,941,4.7439024390243905

6411525,5,B00KAVPEWI,"My 7.5 year old dancer LOVED this movie. And so did I. We watched it together after reading the Isabelle book together. It's so nice to be able to watch a wholesome family movie with a good message for girls about what it means to be kind, compassionate, a good friend, a good sister,  to cherish your own unique talents and not compare yourself to anyone else. It was a valuable lesson to see Isabelle struggle through her challenges (bullying, jealousy, feelings of inadequacy, fear of failure) - but to not give up on her dream. Through self-acceptance and persistence she was able to achieve her goal. And the dancing was great. It was Especially nice to see Isabelle shine when she was feeling joyful (and not fearful) - and realize THAT is the reason we dance.

The newer American Girl movies, sadly, more closely resemble what a girl in America is like: they are all about a young girl completely focused on herself.

There are so many things wrong with both this movie and all of the high-ratings it has received. If you cannot see how petty these films are, and how self-absorbed these girls, parents, teachers and friends act, then you are beyond help.",1423958400,3,561,4.833333333333333

I got this for my 10 year old daughter and she did enjoy the movie.  But I didn't like it for many reasons.  My primary reason was....the girl had a very low self esteem, even though she was a great dancer.  She kept messing up the dance moves and was a big baby about it.  It was so irritating to watch.  When my girls fail I reinforce the fact that frustration is okay but you have to keep trying and work hard.  This movie eventually got to that point but she miraculously had a change of heart the last 15 minutes of the show.

Nice juxtaposition of supporting older sister who is in the spotlight by either dropping out of dance and letting Jade receive her deserved accolades as a special female performer or proceed with unknown territory of duo talented and hard working dance sisters in the public. Isabelle shows how hard it is to find the motivation for dance and you do get glimpses of inspired moments in between the training struggle, the Halloween recital and costume creating.

6411583,5,B00KAVPEWI,"This is another phenomenal movie put out by American Girl. It's entertainment with a purpose; tackling real issues that exist in the lives of our young children. The movie was extremely engaging and emotion evoking. I asked my 13 year old how many stars did this movie earn? She answered four. I asked her what happened to the fifth star? She said the movie brought tears to her eyes so that's where the fifth star went. So, I told her that if she was so touched by the movie that there were tears, then the movie had really moved her which was a good thing. She gave back the fifth star with a smile. I have to admit, I had tears also that I was hiding from the little one. This was the movie choice for our movie day. I highly recommend this one.

6411613,3,B00KAVPEWI,"Since my 7-year-old has been dancing ballet for 5 years, she was incredibly excited to watch this movie.  It's a good story line and teaches girls about  hard work, not giving up, and to be kind to everyone (even to ""mean girls"").  It did really irritate me that Isabelle is supposedly 9 years old.  The actress was 14 when the movie was made, and it's very obvious that she's not 9.  Why didn't they just make her 14 in the movie?  Her body is more developed, she speaks more maturely, and the ballet moves are definitely those of a middle-school aged girl, not elementary school.",1410220800,4,581,4.485714285714286
6411614,3,B00KAVPEWI,"This movie is disappointing.  Isabelle is such a whiner!  Most of these movies are inspirational stories about girls overcoming obstacles to realize their dreams.

6411616,2,B00KAVPEWI,"Terrible trite dialogue, and much older girls are cast as supposed nine-year-olds. The characters are shallow and forced, and the girls' interactions are often exaggeratedly petty and cruel. I only gave it two stars because at least the level of dance talent and the elaborate nature of the shows are appropriate at a performing arts school, (unlike in Saige Paints the Sky). Not a whole lot of value here. Much more about unnecessary drama and glitz than about actually exploring either Isabelle's perseverance or her talents. Would have loved to see more about her designs, to see more of a realistic portrayal of her practicing, etc - there was very little blood and sweat in this, and there were a lot of stormy tears. Basically, you can tell it aired on the Disney Channel, so if campy, glitzy, too-neatly-packaged Disney is not you thing, I'd give it a pass. You can do a lot better by your daughters, I think, even if this isn't harmful as much as simply vapid.",1409875200,3,968,4.7

6411641,5,B00KAVPEWI,"Wen I heard about Isabelle, I was sad. I thought that she would be a shallow dancer, because American girl tends to not have too much diversity in GOTY dolls. But when I saw this movie, I realized what it was about: Isabelle, an aspiring dancer, goes to a preforming arts school and struggles with anxiety. When she gets cast in a major production, she has major problems, as she feels she is nothing more than a shadow of her popular, smart and talented older sister. I think that it is a great movie that all girls should see between ages 9-15.",1408320000,,546,4.362745098039215

6411643,5,B00KAVPEWI,"My daughter loves ballet. She is about to go into her 4th season of dance so of course when we found out that the American Girl, Girl Of The Year 2014 was a ballerina, my daughter was ecstatic. Last year she didn't care as much about the GOTY, but this year she begged for Isabelle and got her for her birthday back in March. She eagerly awaited the movie and couldn't wait to watch it this July. She was not disappointed. For a little girl, this movie is pure perfection. For the mother of a little girl, I would have rated this 4 stars because of all of the giggling and because I felt that the issues in the movie were rich girl issues. Real issues would have been that Isabelle couldn't afford the Summer problem, or maybe one of the other characters. It could have gone deeper in plot, but American Girl sells 110 dollar dolls with 30-40 dollar outfits (Isabelle was 120) so their main audience probably wouldn't have normal problems like lack of money to go to a fancy arts school and afford to pay for not one, but two daughters to take ballet. Understandable. Don't get me wrong, there are some very good life lessons to be learned from this movie, which is why paired with the good life lessons and my daughter's love for the movie, I gave it 5 stars. I would imagine that there really are snooty and mean girls that hassle other children and yes, Isabelle doesn't always handle the criticism with grace, but overall, she tries to do the right thing and at the end of the movie even helps out her tormentor, which opens the door to a friendship. Renata is a mean girl who acts like she has everything, but of course does not. The story isn't completely clear on just why she is so horrible to Isabelle, but it is implied that she is jealous of the close relationship that Isabelle has both with her sister and family. Poor Renata is actually put off by her family in favor of another sibling. Also I'm sure she was just trying to put Isabelle down because she was competition and to make herself feel better. I'm glad that the problem was resolved in a nice way at the end, but was still believable. I LOVE the ""let's all be friends"" mentality of these movies, but we can't just believe that Isabelle and Renata become besties after all that Renata put her through all year. Isabelle's other problems are that she lives in her ""perfect"" older sister's shadow (or so she thinks) and that she lets everything get to her and loses the joy of dance because of it all. I have to admit, I hadn't yet read the book that came with my daughter's doll, so this movie is how I learned Isabelle's story. I had heard the gist of it and thought, ""sigh, blah. The ""living up to her older sister thing"" I really wanted Isabelle to be a good dancer since she is the one with the doll and name on the movie. I myself am always worried that if I have a second daughter that my daughters will have the whole ""will I ever be as good as my sister?"" Luckily, the author of this story also made this scenario believable. Not only is Jade incredibly supportive of her younger sister, but she has her own problems. When you live on a pedestal, sometimes it get lonely or impossible to stay on said pedestal. I liked that Issy was able to find her own light, her own sparkle and also accept that her sister is pretty great too and that is o.k. I really liked the sister dynamic in this movie, and I didn't expect to. Isabelle really did seem to dance with pure joy and heart when she didn't let things get to her. It made it more believable that she was picked for some big parts in the Nutcracker. I love that Jackie sees something in her that might have otherwise held Isabelle back, and you can't help but think how lucky Isabelle was that she had a champion like Jackie Sanchez. What I love the most about this movie is that it taught my daughter two things that she hasn't stopped talking about since she first watched the movie. 1. Don't ever quit and 2. Practice, practice, practice. This movie showed how important that practicing is. Nothing comes easy and the two best dancers in the movie, Jackie and Jade both tell Isabelle that it didn't come easy for them, they had to work for it, they had to put in hours of practice. Because of them, Isabelle doesn't end up giving up, but stays, and eventually is able to pull off the double pirouette for the big show. I really like a good big bang ending and Isabelle doesn't disappoint. I wish she wouldn't have looked so nervous during the big scene where she finally nails the pirouettes because her joy and sparkle that was the reason that she even got the parts, is not able to shine through at a big moment when she needed it to. I was still glad she pulled it off though. I really loved the feel goods in this movie. It is a pretty movie. Lots of nice light, lots of cutesy giggles, lots of good lessons, lots of modest fashion. Also, Melora Hardin as Jade and Issy's mom is wonderful. She is patient, and sweet and has her own talents. You can believe that two amazing daughters came from those parents. I love the part when she says, ""you only live in her shadow if you put yourself there"" Smart mom.",1407888000,5,5144,4.331606217616581

6411646,1,B00KAVPEWI,"We just finished watching the movie. Highly disappointed. Nothing like the historical role models. Isabelle constantly scowled and looked forlorn, was very jealous of others instead of making an effort to better herself, spoke rudely and nastily to her sister and to a bully. Returning nastiness for nastiness is NOT okay in my book. Also, these AG girls are to be role models, using their hardships to provide other young girls with a moral compass to follow on the path to success and giving back to the community selflessly.

What I expected and hoped for: a young girl who faced challenges but overcame them with poise and an admirable attitude. A girl who encouraged other young girls to keep on trying, even if you mess up again and again. I wanted a role model!

That wasn't to be. The movie was 3/4 whining and drama. I also didn't appreciate the dances outside of the actual ballet classes/performance. They were moves that my young girls don't need to be imitating. I don't care if that is what is the ""norm"" now. It doesn't make it right. We'll be sticking to Molly, Samantha and the classics. This one is going in the trash. So unfortunate as my oldest daughter LOVES her Isabelle doll and is in ballet herself! We are using this video as a teaching tool on how NOT to act or react (quite the opposite of what the AG company has stood for until the making of this movie).",1407715200,54,1383,4.550200803212851

6411656,3,B00KAVPEWI,"My daughter purchased this with her gift card and we just watched it as a family. On the plus side, it's better than the Saige movie. However, since the bar is pretty low on that one, it's not too hard. Also on the plus side, who doesn't love the Nutcracker? Beautiful dancing in what my husband and I referred to as ""little kid Flashdance."" There is the obligatory mean girl, the super cool and rich parents, and the expected girl drama surrounding just about every scene imaginable.

Many of my other mother friends lament the move by American Girl away from historical girls facing meaningful and more significant ""crises"" - thinking here of child labor in Samantha, the Depression with Kit, and World War II with Molly, just to name a few. The ""crises"" of girls like Isabelle seem overblown and trite and frankly contribute to a level of shallowness and weakness for girls that I reject categorically.

I want my daughter inspired by girls like Malala, not Isabelle.

As a form of entertainment, it's okay. Not great though. In terms of the messages it sends girls, I have deeper reservations. Yet again, American Girl has cast girls as age 9 when they are clearly much older. These movies give me an opportunity to discuss depth of character in a much-more complex world than is depicted in this movie. As long as my daughter understands that, then we can keep this a point of simple - and simplistic - entertainment. But that's about it.",1407369600,37,1443,4.673228346456693

6411664,5,B00KAVPEWI,"I rented this movie before I saw it's going to air on the Disney Channel August 9 but hey, that's life.

We have only seen 3 American Girl movies so far but this is definitely my favorite.  Isabelle is the Girl of the Year of course and after being introduced to her via Happy Meal, we decided to check out her movie.  Like the rest of the American Girl movies, this movie has very positive themes about working hard, trying your best, etc.

I was very pleasantly surprised that although Isabelle and her sister have certain issues (I'll stay vague so as not to spoil anything), they overall have a very good sibling relationship and clearly love each other very much.  The actresses that play Isabelle and her sister are very talented.  The dance scenes are very well done and impressive as well.

As a fan of The Office, I was interested to see Melora Hardin as Isabelle's mother and she gave a good performance.

Definitely recommend for American Girl fans or even kids just getting into the whole American Girl world.  Ballerinas and non-ballerinas will both love this but children who are familiar with dance and recitals will especially identify with the ballet rehearsal scenes.",1407024000,6,1185,4.713592233009709
