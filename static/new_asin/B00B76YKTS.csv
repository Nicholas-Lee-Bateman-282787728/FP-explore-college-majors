8563546,5,B00B76YKTS,"By far, this is the best version of Raintree County available on the market!  The color photography is breathtaking, and the images do not bleed as the film progresses (which makes me think this was not sourced from some master video tape).  The disc comes with both Italian and English soundtracks; the Italian track is mono, but the English track appears to be Stereophonic sound.  Nat King Cole, in the opening titles, never sounded better!

While it is very apparent the disc is not in High Definition, the clarity of the picture is far superior to what I was expecting.  The widescreen presentation looks to be a 2:35 aspect ration, not the 1:85 as some other foreign discs are.  But I am not an expert on that.  In all, until a US release is available, this PAL Italian release will certainly do the trick as far as I am concerned.  (Of course, you will have to have a multi-region DVD player to enjoy this -- it will not work on standard US DVD players.)",1470960000,,961,4.482758620689655
