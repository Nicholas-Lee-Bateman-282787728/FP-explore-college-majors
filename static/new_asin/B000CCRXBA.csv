Millions chant repeatedly... ""We want the DVD""!!!  This Is the best REO Speedwagon concert ever recorded and we need it on DVD!",1402617600,4,245,4.191489361702128
8097465,4,B000CCRXBA,"Reo captured during the tour for the successful Hi Infidelity album. This is a rare video to find, but is worth renting and even worth buying if you can find it at a decent price. It's cool to see Reo early enough in their career that they're still playing quite a few songs that get overlooked today such as Like You Do, and Only the Strong Survive. I wasn't born until 1984, so I have never seen the classic Reo line up in concert, so this is a pretty cool artifact, and hopefully it will be issued on dvd.",1238716800,,508,4.141414141414141
8097466,5,B000CCRXBA,"I bought this tape when it was first released and watched it more times than I can remember.  Over the years the audio track has faded and there are a few wrinkles in the tape here and there, but that doesn't keep me from pulling it out and watching it yet again.
REO Speedwagon were at their creative and performing peak when this was recorded.  The concert is a spectacular testament to a great band who knew how to put on a captivating show.  The camera work is excellent and captures the next best thing to a front row seat.  It's release on DVD has been criminally overlooked for far too long.",1150070400,,598,4.3125
8097467,5,B000CCRXBA,"This is a great concert that REO did during their Hi Infidelity tour. This a great concert. It has a ton energy, and the crowd is huge. This video really gets the crowd into the show. This is a GREAT buy for anybody who likes REO Speedwagon.",1133481600,2,241,4.148936170212766
