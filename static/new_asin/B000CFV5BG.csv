8098883,4,B000CFV5BG,"This is probably the first and only interview of the Limalama martial art founder, Grandmaster Tino Tuiolosega on video from 1974. As such it offers valuable insight into this rare Polynesian style and allows us to witness Tuiolosega's incredible speed and unique techniques. As a bonus it offers a scene where the hula dance is shown and then interpeted into martial arts applications by Rudy, Mr. Tino's son. Interviewed by Al Garza, a senior Limalama master himself, be sure to buy this rare footage while it's still available.",1170547200,,530,5.034090909090909
