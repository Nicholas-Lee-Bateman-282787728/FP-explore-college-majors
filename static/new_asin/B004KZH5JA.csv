8433611,5,B004KZH5JA,"This show does not deal with truly serious issues. But I don't care.  It's a nice little show that makes me smile.  I love the relationship that Corliss and her parents have. They are friends with their daughter but it doesn't get in the way of being parents. One reason is that they have not forgotten what it was like when they were kids.  And even though Dexter gets on Harry's nerves, he really does like him..  One reason for that  is because Dexter treats Corliss like a Queen.  I recommend this show.",1430956800,,507,4.397849462365591
