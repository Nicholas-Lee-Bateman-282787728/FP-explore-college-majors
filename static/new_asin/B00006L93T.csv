7971000,5,B00006L93T,My kids love all cedarmont videos.  They are all great!  They make Bible songs come alive in this video.  You'll never go wrong with these.  My daughter is 6 and son is 3.  They've been watching them since birth.,1385856000,,212,4.333333333333333
7971001,5,B00006L93T,Though this dvd seems to be a bit dated....my 2.5 year old son watches is closely and is even learning some of the songs.  I like the idea of my child learning songs that will write goodness and truth upon their heart rather than the stupid nursery rhyms like 3 blind mice!!  Have you ever listened to the words of that stuff we grew up on??  It's no wonder our culture is going to hell in a handbasket!  :-),1374537600,,408,4.1265822784810124
7971002,5,B00006L93T,Great DVD.  It also has a preview of 9 additional songs so its like you're getting twice as much music for the same price.,1363219200,,122,4.083333333333333
