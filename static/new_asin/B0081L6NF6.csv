8524014,1,B0081L6NF6,"I have seen some really bad movies in my day but this one was the worst. I wish the producer, director, writers, had come out in the end and killed all of the actors then killed themselves. It would have made no difference and at least I would have been vindicated for wasting my time.  I really like revenge movies but this one was just about stupid meets crazy meets insane meets psychotic meets . Tell me please what was the point?  What was the plot?",1507939200,,454,4.267441860465116

8524019,2,B0081L6NF6,"Unless it was meant to be a silent film, please fix the issue. The plot looks interesting enough though, really there isn't much else to say.",1363737600,,141,4.461538461538462
