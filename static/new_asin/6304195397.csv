 This film is dedicated to all the brothers and sisters who had enough of the man

With this opening text on screen, film-maker Melvin Van Peebles signalled his uncompromising attitude up-front for SWEET SWEETBACKS BAADASSSSS SONG. After his bad experience making WATERMELON MAN (1970), Van Peebles vowed he would have total control over his next project.  This would not be an impassioned Martin Luther King appeal to one nation sentiments. Nor would it be a film bathed in well-intentioned Spielbergian warmth, hoping for a brotherhood that can work together. This was an angry manifesto of non-compliance by blacks toward whites, borne of long-suffering inequality and demonization. Little wonder that the Black Panthers endorsed the movie on release.

It is also widely-regarded as the first film of the Blaxploitation movement. It all begins here

There are many unusual and refreshing qualities to the film. The lead credit is boldly given to The Black Community as a whole, presenting them as a united front of contribution. This will be hammered home even more blatantly later.

SWEET SWEETBACKs title character' played by Van Peebles' does not inhabit a typically soft conventional job for a movie lead. Rather than pander to a lame stereotype, Van Peebles pointedly made him a sexual animal (as he called him in a later interview I saw). Leaving aside the possibility that this plays more on black sexual stereotypes than rejection, Sweetback makes his living by pleasuring the ladies as a stud performer, a technique he acquires at a very young age from a lady within his brothel home. This is an awkward scene to watch as the child actor (Van Peebles' son Mario) is clearly well under the age of legal consent  but arguably is all part of the directors challenge to accepted censorship of home truths on-screen. (Richard Pryor for example was raised in such a home). Regardless, Sweetback grows up a taciturn dude who speaks more with his love-spanner than his vocal instrument.

When his employer frames him for a murder to help two white cops, Sweetback kills them and then must flee the city right out into the Mexican desert. The last half of the movie then becomes a virtual travelogue matched with the funky tunes of Earth Wind & Fire, making one stop-off point where he wins a shagging contest with a chapter of Hells Angels. The extended chase is handled in a rough, hand-held cinma vrit style very much at odds with standard polished film narrative  and very effective for it. While our anti-hero is pursued by the fuzz, what look like real members of the Black Community are quizzed in vox-pops to camera. They close ranks, unanimously reporting variations of I aint seen him as if straight to the white movie audience.  The message from the public to the cops and the man is clear: Since you won't support us, we won't support you either.

This brazen defiance of authority that seems to break the fourth wall is exhilarating  and all too understandable especially as the mainly Caucasian police are portrayed very definitely as deserving it.  The white cops are sadistic and ineffective. Whether its intentional portrayal or simply bad acting, they cant seem to land a decent punch never mind effectively threaten a suspect or catch their man . At one point, the officer in charge of the manhunt drops the n-bomb in his briefing to his men, too late to register two black cops in the team. To compound his ill-judgment, as the rest file out Van Peebles has him taking them both to one side and apologising with You know you two could be a credit to your people. With such face-palm moments of race relations on the force, how can the public trust the Five-Oh to relate respectfully to them?

The documentary vibe of SWEET SWEETBACK is consistent through-out, and Van Peebles makes other experimental style choices: dissolves, freeze-frames, brief split-screen sequences, unfocused shots and even editing choices that repeat dialogue lines. One critic compared his work to Godard in this respect.

Sweetback ends the film still at-large and to a harsh trumpet music cue we are warned Watch out. A baad assss n***er is coming back to collect some dues (My asterisks).  We are left in no doubt that not only has a mission statement of wrath been declared to white society, but with the closing credit of Written, composed, produced, directed and edited by Melvin Van Peebles that it is a singular vision by a proud, real auteur. .  SWEET SWEETBACK'S BAADASSSSS SONG, originally funded by private money, including $50,000 borrowed from Bill Cosby, made back $10m. Blaxploitation was in business",1437868800,,4752,5.024173027989822

804020,1,6304195397,I only watched it after seeing Mario Van Peebles' Baadasssss! The son's love song to his dad and watching him reenact his own life and memories touched me. He set out to make me believe his father wad genius and that in a world of inequality had things been different then the movie industry would have been also. The message that it was the oppressive practices in Hollywood that gave way to Exploitation films was an intriguing one.  So I watched the original. This might have been the gateway to a campy new genre (cementing the green brick road to shows like Fresh Off The Boat and Housewives of Atlanta) but it was just a bad movie with a lousy storyline that evoked a sense of rebellion in people that wanted to slap the face of the establishment. It might have done its job there and it might have made money but it was more Twin Peaks on Meth and with nothing substantial to hang one's hat one.,1425081600,2,902,4.369047619047619

804095,1,6304195397,"I've been told on many occasions that Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song was one of the most groundbreaking, revolutionary films during the blaxploitation era.  I've also read that it was one of the most important black films of all time.  Hey, it came out long before I was born, so I had no idea what these people were talking about.  I had to see it for myself.

While all three points are neglibile, this movie is horrible.

There's hardly any dialouge, the main character lacks any kind of depth.  In fact, the main character says only a few words in the entire film.  The movie consists of him running ""from the man,"" overpowering ""the man,"" and f****** himself out of every situation.  The only thing he's got going for him is having some ""sweetback.""  As a man, I found the notion that he can f*** his way out of his problems disgusting and unrealistic.  I'm not saying this as some kind of moralist.  I love reading and writing noir fiction.  I love cheesy movies and even cheesier noir, but I hate this movie.  If that wasn't enough, the psychadelic cinematography was blurry, grainy and shaky.  In fact, 2/3 rds of the movie consists of unnecessary scenes that have nothing to do with the movie.

The only thing I can agree with is that this film was the most important indie film of all time.  Not black, because its bigger than being a black film.  My reason?  Because without Sweet Sweetback's Baadassss Song making money, none of the much better indie films get made over the past 40+ years, regardless of genre.

Anyone who knows me knows that in order for me to assign anything one-star, its got to be very, very, very, very bad.",1351900800,8,1644,4.549488054607509

This movie is closer to porn than anything else.  But then it would be the Worst Porn Film ever.  At least you can follow what's going on in porn.  My review..shockingly horrible....a fantastic mess.,1304899200,3,491,4.204301075268817
804159,3,6304195397,"The legendary film, Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, was the first film specifically made for the black community,  by the black community, in order to not only give the black community a hero in the cinemas but also to replicate the black experience. It became the first blaxsploitation picture as well as one of the highest grossing independent films of the 1970s. Melvin Van Peebles not only self-financed the film, but also starred in it, wrote the screenplay, and directed it. He also allowed his children to play in it, as well as many of his closest friends. It is one of the most groundbreaking films of all time. It not only helped change the shape of black cinema, but also independent filmmaking at large. It tells the troubled story of a male prostitute named Sweet Sweetback who, after witnessing police brutality against a fellow black man, beats up a police officer. Now on the run from the law, Sweetback must do what he can to avoid and evade the police, even if that means involvement from the Hell's Angels and using his ""talent"".

The big question is, how does the film hold up today? In my opinion, it's still an effective and powerful film in a lot of ways. However, there are some serious problems that many people will either be too distracted or too seasoned to overlook. It's frightfully shot. You can certainly tell that the filmmakers had to use cheap camera equipment because the film looks completely awful. It's one of the ugliest films I have ever seen, and a good portion of the time it's kinda hard to tell what's going on. At a lot of intervals in the film you can see gunk and sludge on the camera lens, and that can most certainly get in the way of the imagery I can imagine. However, personally I think this works to the film's advantage in a lot of ways. It helps add an element of authenticity to the subject matter. This is guerrilla filmmaking at it's best, so I can overlook the camera problems and technical difficulties. This film takes place in a landscape full of junkies, pimps, prostitutes, and other assorted street urchins. A lot of films have a purposefully grungy look and feel to them that gives many films a sense of style. The problem that many people may have here is that in this film it is not used for stylistic purposes. This is where these people lived. This was their world for this particular group of characters. It's rough, it's unpleasant, it's bizarre and it's somewhat nostalgic too. I like how the film gradually shows us more of Sweetback's world than it does of himself. I like that the film is shot in industrial landscapes and grimy alleyways. I think these kinds of settings work really well for a film with this kind of energy. What I appreciate most about this film is that it belongs in a class of it's own. It's definitely not exploitation, nor is it really trying to tell a story. There isn't any character development. There are no revelations or plot twists or surprises, save for the big big one at the very end of the film. There certainly isn't any likable characters, nor are there any characters that you feel you should hate. This film is just good guys, meaning the black community, and the bad guys, meaning white police officers. This film creates it's own landscape. Sure, the landscape may be full of crooked cops and repulsive sex, but it's a landscape that is new and that is fresh and full of energy and life and power and unique imagery.

The film also features a funky soundtrack by Earth, Wind and Fire that really helps push the film into the realm of cult cinema and also gives the film a little more of a sense of ferociousness that you can't help but feel. There's also tremendous style in the editing that you just do not see in films today. In the 70s, there were plenty of films that had the same sort of psychedelic camerawork and visual effects, but none were used like they were here. Instead of being used to add emotion or humor to a scene, here it is used in a way that I found nightmarish, haunting, and incredibly horrific. The film has a lot of radical imagery, and most of that comes when Sweetback is actually running from the man. A lot of it transcends the narrative confines of the film and actually makes a transverse turn into an alternate documentary reality that I found incredibly profound, honest, and admirable. Van Peebles obviously had a lot of ambitions for this film, and it shows. In many ways, this is a documentary. Eventually, the film even breaks the forth wall. I'm not going to spoil any surprises, but I will say that somehow this film gets it right.

When we first see Sweet Sweetback, he is only a little boy, played by Mario Van Peebles (Melvin's son), who appears hungry, dirty, tired, and starved. Soon after we, don't so much as see as much as we, witness a woman taking him into a room and having sex with him. The next time we see him, he is a man and he looks like a black cowboy, heroic and angry. When we see his eyes, however, he looks devoid of humanity, life, emotion, and the slightest hint of happiness. He is not a typical hero by any means. He's an underdog. He's a victim who fights back. He's a damaged man who is using all that remains to fight against what has destroyed his life and the lives of all of his brothers and sisters. I think that when it comes to a lot of films, we only get specific kinds of heroes. We get heroes who we could picture having in real life. To me, Sweet Sweetback is an outcast who has spent his entire life in the lowest parts of the low, and he's tired of it. I'm sure many people have felt like outcasts at one time or another, but not like Sweetback has. I think, despite what you may think of Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song, that this says more about independent film and black cinema than most films would have the balls to say. Even though it may not be a good film, it put a smile on my face and made me want to cheer, and that's something that I can't say about most films of this type.",1286409600,5,5990,4.442727272727272
804160,1,6304195397,"This movie has to be the worst of the Genre, there is no point to it, its disgusting and revolting, it's like a really bad porno, he does this disgusting chubby white girl in the middle of a club, it's gross and has no point. It's not really sticking it to the man if that was what it was intended to do as most similar (related) films are.",1244246400,6,340,4.014705882352941
804161,1,6304195397,"The entire movie has no point, and certainly no purpose. What ever ""Black Power"" message this film was trying to make is lost. You'll find yourself spending most of your time trying to figure out just what in the hell this movie is about. This may have been one of the first ""Black Power"" movies from the 70's and it's also the worst.

 Sweetback pretty much runs through the entire movie, and when he is not running, he is having sex. It only breaks from that cycle to show him beating up a cop or few. The weird thing about this film is that the ""Sex"" has nothing to do with anything! It's mostly just out of context the entire film. This movie really has no plot. It's actually just Melvin Van Peebles running from the city to the desert.

 Watching this movie is like getting high. It's confusing, it makes no sense, and it's just strange as hell. ""You bled my mamma, You bled my pappa, but you won't bleed me"" get used to that phrase, because that's all you'll ever hear in the back tracking music this entire film. Interestingly enough Earthwind and Fire provided the music for this film, this being one of their earliest gigs. That's probably the only signifigant thing in this film worth taking note of.

 I can't even think of a single solitary reason why this is worth watching today. It cetainly is not worth owning. I'm suprised this even made it from VHS to DVD. I mean I don't mind the badly recorded audio or visuals of this film, I expect that. There's plenty of low budget films that look horrible; however, a good low budget film makes up for that with an outstanding storyline. This waste of footage has neither.

 I don't care if this is supposed to be a great ""Black"" accomplishment, this is trash! This is more of a great ""Black"" embarassment. If your looking for a 70's Black Power flick with a message I highly recommend ""Watermelon Man."" Now that's a great film.

 The only thing this films stands as today is a reminder, that even people with absolutely no talent can produce something that generates them money.",1238025600,10,2038,4.4837837837837835

Sweetback beats the crap out of the cops, then runs to Mexico.  This film is remarkable in that it has a feel of a French New Wave film.  Van Peebles had lived in Paris in the 1960's, and the influence of that country's films rubbed off of him here (which is a good thing).  With jump cuts, double exposures, and various other visual tricks, Van Peebles made the most artistic blaxploitation film ever made.  The fact that it doesn't seem concerned with plot either (many European films don't have as much plotting as American ones do) gives it an even more European feel to it.  But the situation is strictly American.  I love the soundtrack too.  Van Peebles wrote the music, but it's performed by Earth, Wind, and Fire.  I do feel that the slogan ""rated X by an all white jury"" is a bit silly.  As another reviewer pointed out, Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, and Scheslinger's Midnight Cowboy all got tagged with an X rating around this time, so it was a tad ridiculous.  No doubt the tag line helped sell a lot more tickets.  I admit I smiled when I saw that on the cover of the film, but then realised that it's really just a gimmick.  Regardless, this is a very good film, provocative, visually exciting, and memorable.",1166572800,7,1393,4.516
804218,4,6304195397,"If you can't appreciate someone else's extreme views don't watch it and shut up about it. Its not the plague it's a movie. People are all up in arms about it. Shut Up and get over it.

Now if I was to go off about how stupid I thought a movie like The Tenant is then it would be a big uproar against my review. Oh wait I already wrote that and plenty people disagree that it didn't deserve the zero stars I wanted to give it. A matter of fact it needs infinity negative stars. Thats not my type of movie or what I thought it might be. But thats my opinion.

This movie was made and played out the way Mr. Peebles wanted it. Get over it. It's his movie he can do what he wants with it. It is a movie like none other I have seen but certain aspects are similar to the other black explotation genre. Sticking it to the man basically.

I read too many negative reviews for this movie. It was time someone real spoke up and said it's great and you need to check it out if you are into these types of films. If you are not just go watch soemthing else.",1162252800,3,1046,3.947867298578199

There were a lot of artistic triumphs to emerge from so-called ""black expoitation"" genre and this is not one of them.  This collage of violently misogynistic images can be attributed to the auteur himself.  The film starts with Van Peebles exploiting his son Mario by showing the adolescent servicing a prostitute.

804221,2,6304195397,"Made for a pittance, initially released in just two theaters, ultimately grossing over ten million dollars, ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" became the progenitor of the ""Blaxploitation"" film craze of the seventies. Considered a seminal film in African-American cinema, Director Van Peebles feels it influenced the independent film movement as a whole. Its jazzy editing and strong hero set it miles apart from the standard fare - one can see how African-American audiences could see this film as a long-overdue cinematic thunderbolt.

The plot is simple. Sweetback (Van Peebles himself) has grown up in a bordello to become one of its central attractions. One night, he agrees to accompany a pair of police officers downtown for questioning. A murder case lacks suspects, and the gesture appears to be compensation for the force's lenience toward the establishment.

En route to the interrogation, however, the police intercept a youth on the street and brutally beat him. Using his handcuffs, Sweetback kills both officers. The rest is a protracted chase, with Sweetback using his fists (among other body parts) to make his way to the border. The police question his companions, hot on his trail with guns, bloodhounds and (at one point) a helicopter.

Van Peebles has an eye for a striking shot, and there's some vivid scenes of police officers brutalizing Sweetback's friend Beetle that get their point across. While its historic contribution is clear, ""Sweetback"" has little to offer modern audiences beyond its kitsch value. Van Peebles is a strong presence as the laconic hero, but there's not much in the way of narrative or memorable characters to savor. There's plenty of sex and violence to be had (the 'X' rating is fully earned), but it's episodic - much of the film seems to be an enormous montage of repeated street scenes and dialogue clips, and the effect rapidly becomes tiresome.

Thirty years after its explosive release, ""Sweetback"" will remain compelling for film historians and students. Its torch has been passed on to to other filmmakers, but the pioneering effort itself has not dated well.

PS - The DVD release has an interview with the director. Initially, it shares some formal similarities with the feature, but later it settles into some interesting (and amusing) anecdotes.

PPS - I just saw ""Badasssss!"" (Mario Van Peebles' docudrama on how ""Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song"" was made) last night (10/25). It makes for a great double feature, as it really helps you to understand how difficult that production was.",1144886400,6,2552,5.167070217917676
804222,3,6304195397,"SWEETBACK WAS THE ORIGINATOR OF THE BLAXPLOITATION GENRE!!Look! Lets be real, Sweetback wasn't that great a movie. However it spawned a movement of Black cinema. How are you going to like films like Coffy and Shaft if you aren't going to acknowledge the movie that started it all. Before Sweetback we had only one star, Poitier. Poitier was fading because the new generation didn't think he was militant enough. To us Poitier was the good negro, a Uncle Tom. We needed a film that would represent the times. YES!! Police brutality was happening. It wasn't something that was made up. YES!!! the new generation was different from previous generation and we was fed up with the system. The film didn't have great cinematography,nor a great script,nor great direction, but it did speak for the millions of angry,young  minorities who felt they didn't have a voice. Whats worse we had some rich minorities who condemned the film but didn't have the guts to put the capital together to put out a better film that spoke to their people.

804223,2,6304195397,"Without the historical context in the early 70s, `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' makes no sense at all. But if you have some knowledge about so-called blaxploitaion films, minor film genre made mainly for Afro-American audiences in the 70s, `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' is still a very bizarre experience to you. And I am a Japanese, fan of Pam Grier films, but I believe the film about `Sweet Sweetback' looks strange wherever you live.

The content or message of `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' can be summarized in the following words you will see at the beginning of the film: ""This film is dedicated to all the Brothers and Sisters who had enough of the Man."" Most probably before this film no film had ever tried to show a black character hitting and knocking out a white (and a white cop for that matter), and for better or worse, the way the film does it is amazingly raw and crude.

The Man is represented by several non-descriptive white cops who beat up a black. When star and director Melvin Van Peebles says he had enough, he (or his character) shows it by bludgeoning the cops senseless. The police (largely whites) are not competent enough to chase Sweetback, and he gets away very easily from them. By the conventional standard of narrative, the film is almost pointless, going on and on without showing where it is leading us. Occasionally we see Sweetback helped by some and betrayed by others (including blacks), or the strange episodes of Sweetback drinking the water in the mud.

It might look strange today that the film actually became a big hit in 1971, but it did. What distinguishes `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' from the films like `Shaft' and `Coffy' both commercial success, is the crudeness of its message and the techniques. As to the message there is nothing that I can add here, I tried to find the sub-texts in the scenes of Melvin Van Peebles running endlessly in the street of LA, or lots of nude bodies in the film, but could find nothing in them.

You know what you should expect from the low-budget film with less-than-enough lighting equipment. That happened in the films like `Superfly.' But `Superfly' doesn't have so many double exposures, out-of-focus images, and other tricks that could be seen only in the psychedelic era. At the same time, the film is also notable for clever use of the jazzy and funky soundtrack by Earth Wind and Fire, setting the trend of the blaxploitaion films and their music.

But all these things do not prove that the film is still good as entertainment nor justify the abundant nudities and sex scenes. The opening section showing young Sweetback (played by Melvin's real-life son Mario) is still unnecessarily graphic and even shocking to some today.

Perhaps as Mario Van Peebles did in his `Baadassss!' a filmic account of the making, `Sweet Sweetback's Baad Asssss Song' is most interesting if seen with social and personal history behind itself. Otherwise, the messy film is hard to enjoy as it is today.",1143763200,15,3008,4.797297297297297
804224,3,6304195397,"just see it.  i'll say that much.  it is pretty flimsy stuff, content-wise, but it had something going for it stylistically.  it looks like a 60s primative art flick.  there were a multitude of attractive shots and great late 60s psychedelic vibes.  it actually reminded me a little of easy rider, but not as good.  whereas easy rider is a sort of plotless ramble of a hippy death trip in the desert set to good music, sweet sweetback is a kind of naive celebration of the black penis within a plotless ramble of a black panther trip in the desert set to good music.

the earth wind and fire music is fantastic.  however the main musical theme was overused and it comes off as awkward as it fades in time after time throughout the movie.  particularly effective though is the strange vocal chanting bits.  it's vaguely like a call and response baptist congregation, a heavy handed evocation perhaps, but it's really cool sounding and it builds tension as sweetback runs through the desert.  and speaking of the desert, peebles doesn't get enough credit for his visual knack.  the colors and tangibility of the barren desert and industrial blase' of the southern california back country is very well photographed.

so in the end i wasn't offended by this.  do i care that a young mario was filmed having sex with an actress?  not really.  i read an interview with mario recently, he doesn't seem much the worse for wear and he has a lot of respect for his father and this film (maybe too much?).  the race politics of the film may indeed be confusing and seem off the mark.  the film is very quaint, actually, in that regard.

but i think it is enjoyable as a mood piece. many of the incidental parts are obviously just played by people peebles found on the street.  it's awesome footage.  a very attractive tapestry of old school cali funkiness. i feel that the movie works on a metalevel and in spite of the many idealogical flaws it's a great document from the era.",1133913600,5,1967,4.562857142857143
804225,1,6304195397,"I realize that there are a lot of people who want to be politically correct by saying that this is a ground breaking film.  I also realize that there are alot of black people (I'm black) who feel they are betraying the race by openly rejecting anything that other blacks say is ""groundbreaking"" or ""revolutionary.""  There are certainly some folks who like it.  However, as one of Spike Lee's characters said in Bamboozled (a much better, more groundbreaking film by the way), black people aren't not just one big monolithic group who all think alike.

So here's my opinion as one black individual.  This film is crap.  It opened with the most humiliating, horrific scene in which an old whore entices a child to have sex with her.  The fact that Peebles uses his own son in this scene is nauseating.  This may be Peebles's experience (although somehow I doubt it...it seems more like a misguideded way to shock and engage the audience)but it is not the ""black experience."" Far from ""groundbreaking, this scene validates for every skinhead on the universe the idea that blacks have no morals and I can say without reservation that many people (black, white or purple) would find this scene disturbing and beyond their experience and comprehension.

Oh, but it gets worse.  Between Sweet's pants down around his ankles whenever the opportunity arrises, his ego driven ""violence against the man"" (any man as long as he is white) and him running like some hopped up marathoner, it's a cross between boring, self-serving and pathetic.

So what if the themes were ones that had never been filmed before?  Neither thankfully has a live execution.  Not having filmed a theme before does not automatically make that theme ""groundbreaking.""  So what if he made $10 million on a film that cost him $50,000 to make?  ""Birth of a Nation"" made good money when it was released.  The amount of money a film makes is no indication of it's quality.  ""Weekend at Bernie's"" validates that point.

Forget the film's theme.  Let's talk about the bad, ""ahhhoohhaahhheeehh"" sound track, the shaky, ""grandma made a home movie"" cinematography, the sketchy, blurring, incoherent ""whatcha wanna do...no, whatcha wanna do"" editing.  This film is an embarrassment.  It reminds me of a professor in college who wanted to create an anthology of black student poetry.  I asked him, ""Are there any requirements for quality or content?""  He said, ""No, I just want to show that we can write.""  Pffffft.  Well, here's a sample...ABCDEFG.

If you want to be entertained by a Blaxiotation film, go get Foxy Brown, Shaft, Super Fly, Dolomite or any of the many better films in this gendre.  If you want to indulge in earlier masterpieces made by black film masters, try Body and Soul or Within Our Gates.

If you want to take a peek at the black experience, circa post 1970 (as much as one or two or twelve films can engage you in an experience that encompasses people from all different backgrounds, philosophies and approaches to life), buy Spike Lee's something or one of the many black film makers with real talent's something or circa 1950-1960, go watch a Sidney Poitier film.

But racking your brain trying to find some deeper meaning in this self serving, egotistical yet mediocre crap is a wasteful use of those little gray cells.  Mediocrity isn't a crime but translating it into ""art"" because some black or white activist might start shouting about racism is just cowardly.

Peebles should have had the guts to just call the film, ""I got the big one and a big gun"" but somebody (probably a friend) talked him into presenting it as a ""message"" film to pull in the church folk, the real activists and to keep people from criticizing it for fear of ""sounding racist.""  Good move.  But it's still crap.

SWEETBACK is very cheaply made.  The night scenes are nearly impossible to see.  Melvin, when he isn't running, looks like he's posing.  The sex scenes get to be self-serving after a while (would white bikers of that era really cheer on a black man sexin' one of their women?).

True, there were other black films before this one, but never one like it, and really, there never would be again.
Melvin van plays Sweetback, a professional stud who works live sex shows, who is picked up by the cops to help them look as though they are working on a murder case. But when, the cops stop to rough up a revolutionary, Sweetback suddenly develops revolutionary ideas of his own and beats up the cops with his own handcuffs and goes on the run. That's essentially it, and what may seem boring, dated, disgusting and/or silly to most people, was some radical stuff back in 71. [...] It's radical enough now, you ain't ever seen a film like this! During his travels, Sweetback encounters all kinds of opposition (cops, biker gangs, posses etc), sees all kinds of places in the ghetto (baptist churches, rat-infested tenements, and finally the dessert)and is subjected to all kinds of experimental film making (colour tints, subjective shots, weird angles, freeze-frames etc.)
What makes this film so different and exciting for me, is that having obviously been made with private money and many, many miles away froma  studio, it can and does push the politics and revolutionary rhetoric right in your face and believe me it does! It is little wonder that Huey Newton (supposedly) made this required viewing for the Black Panther Party and that within a short time films like Shaft, Superfly and their clones were filling the cinemas on 42nd Street. Unlike the legions of films that followed this, which became more and more watered down copies of the central idea of this film (that a black man can take on his oppressors and actually win), this film is the REAL DEAL and power to van Peebles for having the guts and wherewithall to get his vision splashed across the screens.",992304000,32,2034,4.878612716763006
804334,3,6304195397,"Well! The initial scenes of child sex and abuse nearly made me switch off but I had read so much about the revolutionary chractersitics of the film that I kept on. The result: I was seriously concerned by the limited articulation of the black voice and the degredation of black women. On it's own, the film fails to achieve the percieved aim of shattering sociological stereotypes. The principal character is a pimp and his expression is limited to sex and violence and the women (white and black) are sex objects. However, in a historical context the film goes beyond the narrow bounds of smiling domestics and water melon guzzling buffoons that dominated pre 1970s representations of black people. I dunno perhaps this is what was real to Van Peebles and much of the black population in US ghettos. Helpful? yes, to those who could finally see themselves as heros; Damaging? Yes because we still live in a world too narrow minded to percieve race as a social construct and not a biological trait in terms of personality and value systems.",989280000,7,1040,4.783333333333333

This was recommended to a friend by Amazon because of our purchases of the comparatively enlightening and morally uplifting Dolemite videos. This  movie begins by condoning the statutory rape of a ten year old boy, and  descends to new depths of film depravity. The one recurring theme in this  film is: RUNNING! YES! How exciting can in get watching Sweet run for what  seems like hours. This belongs exactly where we put our copy:in the  garbage.",956275200,23,503,4.735632183908046
