6244231,5,B00HZMZ272,"My review on both films:

You Got Served: I had this movie on DVD before, but it messed up. This was B2K's first and only movie together. This was the first break dancing film that I've ever seen. Almost every scene in the film has dance battles and they get crazier every time, especially Wade's crew. Whether you wanna love or hate B2K, I myself personally still listen to their music and I'm lovin every minute of it. (5 stars)

Stomp the Yard: This movie is similar to You Got Served, except this movie features stepping with a little mixture of break dancing. This was Chris Brown's first movie, even though he had a small role. In fact. when this movie first came out, I heard that people walked out of the theatre when Chris Brown's character died. I'll admit that was pretty messed up. However, I did enjoy the rest of the film and it was very deep. (5 stars)

I love both of these movies. You Got Served and Stomp the Yard are two great films to look into. Although both of these movies received poor reviews, they both reached #1 at the box office and I still consider them two of the best films I have seen. Both of them have very good plots, a phenomenal cast and insane battles. I would consider You Got Served as my favorite. By the way, is it just me or has anyone else noticed that Meagan Good is in both of these films?",1427500800,2,1336,4.2727272727272725
