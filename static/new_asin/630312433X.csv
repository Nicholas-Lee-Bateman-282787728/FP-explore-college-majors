590455,2,630312433X,"A controversial televangelist turns up dead and the police suspect that lingerie catalog proprietor Claire Laurent (Susan Lucci) might have done the deed since the televangelist targeted her sinful merchandise. Investigating detective Robert Cassidy (Lee Horsley) is not happy since he's falling for the alluring woman who just might be a murderer. Claire is without an alibi, but there are a host of others out there with motive to kill not so squeaky clean preacher. But as Robert uncovers yet another lie that Claire has told him, can he trust that she is innocent?

Bearing little resemblance to the riveting novel penned by Sandra Brown, this made for TV screen adaptation is simply horrific. Marred by extremely bad acting (hello, there is a reason Lucci waited so long for an Emmy then got one out of consolation), horrible casting of too old actors (Lucci is about 50; Claire is about 30 in the novel), atrocious dialogue, and poor plot changes that do nothing for the story (was it really necessary to change Robert into a detective - he was the straight laced DA), it never really emerges above melodramtic mediocrity. Which is a shame because the novel is actually fantastic.

I often wonder why Hollywood doesn't look to some of the novels and adapt them for the screen. Now I know why. They simply don't know how to.

590459,1,630312433X,The movie was awful. The acting was awful. This movie didn't do the book any justice. They were missing so much information that the book gave. The people who directed the movie even changed the name of one of the charcters(Yasmine) and didn't talk about the murdered victim wife and son. My advice to anyone is to don't even bother watching this movie. Read the book it is much better.,1090886400,2,386,4.5285714285714285

590514,3,630312433X,"Although I fancy myself an intellectual, I do enjoy a good trashy book from time to time and I have a like of Sandra Brown's work.  Thrillers are always good times, and, let's admit it, throw in a little sex and violence and it's a party.  Made for TV movies, however, are not always great and this was no exception.  The acting was good (but not great), and Susan Lucci was the main character, Claire Laurent.  When you say her name, you think of soap operas.  And while this is certainly a ""soap opera"" type of book/movie/TV show, they could have taken out a few of the very ""soap elements"" that turned this into a soap.  If that makes sense.

Names of the original characters have been changed for copyright reasons, but for the sake of redundancy, this is one juicy book with a murder mystery.  The Rev Bird has been murdered in his hotel suite with three gunshots, he was on an anti-smut campaign and bent on outlawing a lot of paper media pornography.  While the typical girly mags always fall under said cannon (Playboy, Hustler, etc.), so did the French Silk catalogue.  This mirrored the rise of the Victoria's Secret catalogue in the early 90s which became the resident coffee table catalogue in every house across America and how many were calling it too suggestive or racy for Middle America.  With this, Detective Cassidy is called in to investigate how and why this underwear company has come into the spotlight by this evangelist, and he meets the CEO, Claire Laurent.  She has a dotty mother who she takes care of, a business partner, Martine, who is having an affair with a married man,  Congressman Alister Petry, who she is convinced will leave his wife and marry her someday.  And they all had some kind of beef with Rev Bird and it's all going to come down somehow.  Of that I will not reveal the twists and turns and the inevitable.  Of course Cassidy and Claire are going to fall in love, that I know I do not have to tell anyone.  Words to criticize?  Susan Lucci was in her 50s trying to play in her 30s.  And while she may have been able to get away with it thanks to staying thin and plastic surgery that her peers are not able to have access to, she's still older.  They also decided to eliminate the subplot with the good Reverand Bird's wife, Ariel, his son, their affair, and her ambitions to keep the ministry going under her rule.  It would have made the viewer guess moreso as it would've introduced a few new suspects and motivations, but for the sake of abbreviation they kept it to the main characters.  Still waters certainly run deep.  It's also a chick movie, but most can probably guess that from the beginning.  I do wish that her mother, Mary Catherine, was a bit more crazy than she was, as it made for a more interesting viewing.  Otherwise a nice afternoon watch.

It makes for an ok afternoon on a rainy day, but forgettable.",1373673600,,2872,4.475
