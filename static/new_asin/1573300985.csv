191261,5,1573300985,A great video collection for Savage Garden fans. The only downfall is that it does not have all of the different videos made for these songs. But any fan will truly enjoy the videos that are on here. It'a a walk down memory lane for pop fans!,1235520000,,242,4.170212765957447
191262,4,1573300985,"I purchased this video because I haven't seen any of Savage Garden's music videos. But watching video after video, with an option to view the lyrics, it was great.

Especially seeing their different styles and concepts. The first video, ""I Want You"" you can see how young they were. They were only in their early twenties and you can see that.

The other videos, ""To The Moon And Back"" ""Truly Madly Deeply"" ""Break Me Shake Me"" and ""Tears Of Pearls"" are great, too.

It's a definite buy and a great add-on for your Savage Garden collection.",1141084800,,539,4.59375
191263,5,1573300985,"I enjoyed this item very much. As a big Savage Garden fan, I think all fans should get this. I enjoyed the videos and it's good to know that I have them on dvd to watch whenever I want. :-)",1120780800,,189,3.75
191264,5,1573300985,"If you are from North America, like I am, then you probably missed out on the videos for ""Break Me Shake Me"" and ""Tears of Pearls"". This is dvd/video is worth buying simply to see those videos. It does only contain 5 videos, but they are so much fun to watch, especially seeing the evolution of Darren from dreds to short short hair.",1102291200,2,333,4.301587301587301
191265,4,1573300985,"This music DVD scores 5 stars for what is on it-the 5 videos.
But it scores poorly for what it lacks.-the australian videos and mabye a short biography/discography or some comments by the duo, or some pics.
I am still looking for a way to get a hold of the Aussie videos- email me if you know a way.
Sorry, but a score of 4 is given due to the lack of any extras or aussie videos.",1077494400,,380,3.948051948051948
191266,5,1573300985,"I loved this DVD. It gave me chance to see videos that were never seen in this country,USA. This DVD is worth the money, sit back and enjoy. I'ts a keeper.",963100800,8,155,4.032258064516129
191267,5,1573300985,"This video is awesome.  Those guys make the most beautiful music in the whole wide world, and if that wasn't enought they've got great videos.",957052800,5,142,4.68
191268,5,1573300985,"I first viewed Savage Garden: The Video Collection DVD last night. I've been a fan of Savage Garden since the beginning, but hadn't had a chance to  see any of their videos.  I was definitely impressed with this DVD. The  interactive menus are cleverly designed and easy to use, and the subtitles  (lyrics) are great for singing along (which I did) or for learning the  words of the individual songs. There are some added features such as  chapter access to songs and a profile of Savage Garden.  There are five  videos on this collection: To The Moon and Back, I Want You, Truly Madly  Deeply, Tears Of Pearls and Break Me Shake Me. The fun of this DVD is in  watching the differing hairstyles, clothes, atmospheres, and creative  visions of the individual videos. Although there are no interviews or  voiceovers, this collection provides a wonderful insight into Savage  Garden.  The music of Savage Garden represents many years of  behind-the-scenes effort by instrumentalist Daniel Jones and vocalist  Darren Hayes, and these videos perfectly capture the raw energy of the duo.  This DVD is quickly becoming my favourite!",946339200,44,1125,4.962365591397849
7798066,5,1573300985,To me their best songs really.  It's very short so I should ping it but .... it's in surround!!!! Sound is good.  Video is very good too considering the time. A lot of the MTV videos can be grainy.  So if your a huge fan you probably want to pick this up if you've got a setup to play it on....  Essential if your a fan.  Recommend for you MTV era fans of surround.... sweet! Have fun!,1513296000,,385,3.948051948051948

7798070,5,1573300985,Great band! Great music! Great DVD!!  Found it hard to find this DVD but once we did we were not disappointed.  It arrived in the mail even before the expected time frame which was a nice surprise. Thanks!!!,1393632000,,207,4.421052631578948
7798071,5,1573300985,I had forgotten about Savage Garden and just recently I found Darren Hayes on YouTube and all of my memories of Savage Garden came back to me. I just loved this band back in the late 90's. I still love this band! Now I'm into what Darren Hayes has done and will continue to do. I just love him and his music!!!;),1389571200,,312,4.048387096774194
7798072,5,1573300985,"I like all the music it provided, I wish they had more videos to the collection. It had a good sound to it too! The disc and case came in good condition.",1379548800,,153,3.8125
7798073,4,1573300985,"These hits are almost their best, but why leave off ""I knew I loved you""? This is a spectacular song. I'm a little tired of having to go to Youtube to see it. The song ""To the moon and back"" was one that I only heard a minute of on my radio, but the dj didn't tell who sang it. I tried and tried to track down the lyrics and no one could tell me what it was. But, to me it sounded just like Savage Garden. Thanks to the snippets on Amazon, I found it and immediately ordered the cd. Pretty good for only catching the words ""ticket"" and ""back"". I just knew I had to try and find the singer. I'm only giving three stars due to the missing video. The rest is great, no doubt.......EDIT: 04/20/15, I had to change this to 4 stars. I am disappointed that ""I Knew.."" wasn't in it but I read the helpful comment where a fellow customer explained why. Two, 2,3, 4 years down the line I always get around to my old comments. I only hope Darren will be on tour here soon. I know my wife will love this guy.",1307232000,,996,3.9601990049751246
7798074,5,1573300985,I love this DVD. The videos are wonderful and can't forget Darren's lovely voice. So worth the every penny and then some.,1267142400,,121,4.545454545454546
7798075,4,1573300985,"I had this on VHS and just wanted to update, and although the DVD doesn't have a TON of extras, it's still really cool. It has some of the classic videos and then a little bio on the group. You can play the videos regular or with lyrics..I love these guys! =)",1240963200,,259,4.0
