8365233,4,B002DHSGYU,"This was an interesting, but somewhat superficial, documentary on alchemy. It has been argued that modern science actually grew out of alchemy. Jung was also heavily influenced by alchemical imagery that he believed tapped into archetypes that are inherent in human consciousness. Given the depth of the subject, I've have appreciated more depth in the documentary. Still, it wouldn't be bad for people who know nothing at all about alchemy.",1276473600,,441,5.314285714285714
