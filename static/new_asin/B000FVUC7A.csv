8127412,5,B000FVUC7A,"A beautiful little film from Denmark. Very enjoyable and superb acting by the two main child actors, Sarah Juel Werner as Tinke and Peter Jeppe Hansen as Larus. The film takes place in 1850's Denmark which probably won't interest many movie viewers in this day and age but it has a sweet story of a boy and a girl that really affects anyone who views this film. Not to be corny or sappy in my comments but I just loved the film. No Hollywood kid actors could even attempt to fill the roles of Werner or Hansen in this film. European child actors just seem so natural in films compared to the really hammy American kid actors today. Just look at the terrible kid actors on the Disney Channel. Sarah Juel Werner has made several films, but Tinke was her first big role and she is amazing. Without question she has the most beautiful blue eyes I've ever seen! This film is not available in the USA format so a multi-region DVD/Blu-Ray player is required to view it. It is because of films like this that I purchased a multi-region player. It was sure worth it!",1433116800,3,1057,4.3979591836734695
8127413,5,B000FVUC7A,"Good children films today are made in Europe (Sweden, Danemark, Holland, France).  LITTle BIG GIRL is one of the most interesting films made for anybody (!!!) ever.  If you miss this ""children movie"" you would miss alot.  It is beautiful filming, wonderful story, no nonsens, and it grabs you from the beginning to the end.  See it with your child of any age.  Or watch it as a grownup alone or with your friend.

Finally a film which works without the nowadays almost always present science fiction which turns any film into something unralistic.  This one is realistic.

If there ever was a movie good for any age - then this is the one!",1225152000,3,639,4.543859649122807
