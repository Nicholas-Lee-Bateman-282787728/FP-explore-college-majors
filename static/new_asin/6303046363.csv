8489291,5,6303046363,"I saw this originally when my son was young as part of the ""Long Ago Far Away"" Series hosted by James Earl Jones. There are several that I remember being quite good but they are hard to find and of course they don't include the hosting by Mr. Jones.  But this is still a great upbeat movie about a boy elephant and his Uncle who develope a special bond when the boys parents are lost at sea.",1175126400,2,391,4.077922077922078
