7363904,5,B013FCN628,"*I received a review copy of this season in exchange for an honest review

I am still continually impressed with the number of great shows on television these days.  Ive stated many times my love for shows like THE WALKING DEAD and GAME OF THRONES, but there are many new(er) ones I have recently fallen for.  RAY DONOVAN is one of these recent additions for me.  Granted, it is in its third season, but I only started watching it a couple of months ago.  I am glad I gave it a shot, too, because this is one of those TV shows youll be talking about long after its over.  Chocked full of drama and intensity, RAY DONOVAN is a series you must watch to appreciate.

In an environment full of remakes and do-overs, I find it refreshing to still discover fresh concepts and interesting premises.  Im sure there are or have been similar shows out there, but I am not familiar with them if so.  Thus, I will continue this review under the premise RAY DONOVAN is a unique idea.

Each episode of RAY DONOVAN is shot well and looks great onscreen.  The production budget appears to be high, and the results are evident in the detailed scenes onscreen.

The acting is very high caliber.  Ive enjoyed Liev Schreibers work for many years now, and I am excited to see him in such a versatile role.  With RAY DONOVAN, Schreiber gets to flex his acting chops and gives a top notch performance.  He is supported by a superb cast that includes Jon Voight, Elliot Gould, Paula Malcomson, and Eddie Marsan.

The writing in the show is what makes it such a win for me.  The plot lines are taut and filled with twists and turns.  The dialogue is crisp and witty.  And the characterizations are well fleshed out and believable.  You cant ask for much more out of a TV series.

RAY DONOVAN is a big win for me, and I hope the show can continue with the powerful momentum it currently has.  Be sure and pick it up on Blu-ray, so you can enjoy the HD picture and sound.  Season 3 is available today.",1451347200,7,1974,4.347945205479452
7363905,5,B013FCN628,Another killer show! Highly well done and a shame its on a pay channel! Must see stories,1445904000,6,88,4.235294117647059
7363906,5,B013FCN628,"This was, in my opinion, the best season yet. Ray Donovan is the greatest crime thriller since the Sopranos, and season three hit a new peak for me. Nonstop twists and great character development. I can't get enough of it.",1444780800,6,222,4.575
7363907,5,B013FCN628,"Best show! Can't wait to finish this season but will be sad I will be all caught up.

Give it a try, I promise you WILL not be disappointed. Up there with Sopranos and Boardwalk Empire.",1441065600,13,185,4.138888888888889
7363908,5,B013FCN628,"This is the best season of the series so far.

Ray is still not to be trifled with. He still strong arms his targets, but if his targets are really the victims he does right by them this season. At the same time you see a much more vulnerable side of Ray. He is forced to make some tough decisions and sacrifices to help his brother Terry. It's made the Ray character much more likable.

The addition of the Finney family, a fictitious media mogul family that is beyond dysfunctional, vying for Ray's loyalty to their individual wars against one another has been a great plot element. At first when they hire Ray you think it's going to be a lot of 'errand boy' type episodes where they send Ray to go beat someone up for some reason. But they don't go that direction. It ends up being very interesting as Ray tries to navigate their dysfunction and play the side he thinks is morally right.

The whole story line with Terry starting off in prison is a great sub plot. It's hard to not like Terry. And then there's a priest investigator who starts looking into the Donovans about the disappearance of Bunchy's abuser form season 2. I won't say more, but it's interesting. (Neither of these sub plots are spoilers. The Terry plot is how season 2 ended. The priest investigator plot is introduced in episode 1 of season 3)

The only part I don't like about season 3, or any season for that matter, is the Mickey character played by Jon Voight. Voight plays the role perfectly, but the character is just a drag on the show. Mickey is always in the way, always causing problems, always on the verge of a killer deal that goes south and causes someone else pain. He's just a slimeball who's easy to hate. I know his character is written to be exactly that, but he doesn't bring anything to the series. He's like a side show that distracts from the other characters. But that's not a change for season 3. That's been a running theme in the series.

In any case, season 3 really shapes up to be the best season so far.",1439769600,23,2011,4.380697050938338
7363909,5,B013FCN628,"The best news for season three for the show is the arrival of Ian McShane as Malcolm Finney, a slippery rich character who contracts for Ray for his exclusive specialist services. Even when Ray Donovan's actions have consequences and he soon learns that doing, the right thing can also be dirty business. Ray has taken some hits, in season two, which would leave lesser men down for the count, but what does not kill a Donovan only seems to make him stronger. Alas Rays special skills cannot be applied to his personal family life, as in his wife and siblings, seems to be going into freefall.",1438819200,18,593,4.60377358490566

7363968,3,B013FCN628,"To be honest my hopes were not high after Season 2 but this one delivered at least as far as the first half of the season. I won't spoil it for anyone too much but when you see a certain female sitting on the couch when Ray meets up with Ian MacShane (a nice addition to this season) you'll do a double take. It also took me a few episodes to figure out what was going on with her mouth (and not in the usual Anne Hathaway parodying her smirk/smile way . . . and that is a HUGE hint at the mystery actress).

Also, check out the ""Melrose Place"" and ""Charlie's Angels"" cameos. There's also a Samir from ""Person Of Interest"" as an Armenian pop singer. It also seems like Ken Cosgrove of ""Mad Men"" was brought in to get bloody as he did in that former series.

Anyway, after looking like we'd be concentrating more on Ray's job with Ari back in the picture, it's same old angsty family battles. Although Jon Voigt's Mickey is, as always, a hoot again the rest of the family pretty much sucks any energy out of the momentum the crime storylines create. At least Ray's wife has become less of screaming banshee in Season 3 but now we have Terry doing dumb things and Bunchy getting into one weird loving but definitely dominatrix-type situation that made no sense. I'll leave it at that.

Finally, the final showdown scene is ridiculous. I mean, if Armenians are bringing in girls from Uzbekistan in a container on a ship, I hardly think they'd be caught that unawares but Ray, Avi and Tweedle Mickey. Come on, the Armemians are probably a notch lower than the Chechens and Russian mafias in America.

Honestly, without Liev Schreiber I'd have given up on this Sopranos Lite series ages ago. I'm invested but can we just get rid of his entire family bar Mickey?

The DVDs are not worth getting as there are no Ray Donovan extras at all. All you get are the first episodes of two Showtime series--""The Affair"" and ""Billions.""",1472947200,,1919,4.424929178470255

7363985,3,B013FCN628,"So if you are watching Ray Donovan Season 3, then that means you are already a Ray Donovan fan, but sad to say, Season 3 is a big disappointment.

Live Schreiber is still the best part of the show. He gets 5 stars from me, but the season itself I felt was the weakest of the three.

SPOILER ALERT

Stop reading if you do NOT want to know what this season was about and why I feel that it was the most flawed.

Season 3 follows the same format as the other 2, Ray is a LA Fixer who get the job done at any costs. His boss from Season 1 and 2, Elliot Gould, is on his deathbed and Ray has distanced himself from him based on how Season 2 ended.

Needless to say, Ray ends up meeting a new employer, Ian McShane. Ian McShane, like everyone else on this show, has a messed up family. His daughter is a power hungry, next-in-line type, played by Katie Holmes. His son is a drugged up artsy type. His top assistant is also his son-in-law. Midseason, we are re-introduced to the former head of the FBI, played by Hank Azaria who now works in a risk-management type firm.

Throughout the season, there are problems, fixes, more problems, more fixes. All still following the same format as the previous two seasons. Ray's family is still messed up: his son a sexual deviant, his daughter a desperate for love teen, his wife a mopey stay at home mom complaining about everything, his brothers a Parkinson's victim and a former priest-abused-as-a-child man boy, and his father an always-looking-for-the-next-score con man.

All this you would already know by watching the first 2 seasons.

Now here are the flaws of season 3. Basically the writing wasn't as good as previous seasons, with a lot of stuff being left hanging in the breeze.

For starters, with all these well known actors/actresses, you would expect some good acting. Negative. Ian McShane was good as a billionaire recluse but other than him, the guest ""stars"" disappointed. Katie Holmes, who is a bad actress to start, was fitted with braces to make her appear to be a late-teen daughter of McShane. Even with braces, she looks like an over 30year old, so I am not exactly sure what age she was supposed to be but it didn't fit. As soon as we meet her, we already know she's gonna end up in bed with Ray. Hank Azaria was back as former head of FBI, Cochran, but he really had little to do, but sit at his desk and foam over catching Ray. The actor who plays the investigating priest, youd know him by face, his storyline was ridiculous too. Half the time, they don't even mention him. Then the other half, he is basically becoming a best friend to one of Ray's brothers.

Ray's messed up family is partly because of how cold and distant Ray is, but they are beyond messed up. His wife, the uber annoying Abby, is a whiney self-absorbed former Townie who believes she deserves a lavish lifestyle but does nothing. She even up and leaves her kids (who knows how long because they don't say) to go on a me-time-vacation back to Boston, to visit her loser brother and sister who still run their crappy bar. Her storylines went nowhere, seemed unnecessary and I forwarded through much of her dialogue. For some odd reason, she almost hits this giant dog while driving, and then decides to get out of her car and chase after the dog to make him her pet. What? She leaves her car and no one jacks it? Then brings home the giant dog, who she names dog, and what exactly was the point of this? She grows attached to this giant dog, then tells her brain-dead son to take the dog for a walk, only to have this idiot just open the door and the dog runs out. She gets even more annoying later on, but I will wait for Terry's review.

Ray's kids, albeit messed up because they have messed up parents, lack any common sense whatsoever. The son, Conor, is now a horny bonehead who is basically a moron. His daugher Bridget, is a love-desperate-teen, who starts at a new school, makes no friends and then falls for her math teacher. They share a common bond, he lost his wife, while she lost her rapper boyfriend last season. The teacher was rumored to have killed his wife in a car accident, but later tells Bridge she died from an aneurysm yet he has a scar on his face and keeps referring to the accident. It seems the writers couldn't decide which story to stick to. This dopey affair just got dopier and dopier.

Ray's brothers, Brendan (Bunchy) and Terry, had storylines that were equally ridiculous. Terry, in jail thanks to their dad's botched robbery attempt, ends up fighting and killing an Aryan in jail and is now in fear for his life. His Parkinson's is also getting worse. Yet he asks Ray to not help him and to leave him in jail. What? Ray gets him out anyway then later, Ray and Abby convince him to live with them. Terry then starts acting all cutesy with Abby and who didn't see that coming? Cmon, Ray and his brothers are so close (yet they arent) that they would never do that to each other. Bunchy, the man-boy, gets a crush on a chubby Michelle Rodriguez Luchador, who ends up marrying him, because they understand each other. How? He was abused as a boy by a priest and she's a Mexican wrestler, how are they even similar lives? After about a month, they get married and talk of starting a family. Anyone can see this man is not meant to be a father (see Season 2). Bronson Pinchot looks like someone ate Balky Bartakamous.

Now onto Ray's father, played by Jon Voight. He also gets 5 stars because he plays slimey Mick with gusto. The only problem is his storyline is also weak. He is now living in a complex that has hookers and a pimp. He eventually weasels his way (murders) into being the pimp and has his son, Darryl, working as his muscle and driver. They get involved with the Armenian mob yet when they eventually want to back out of their deal they still go back to their complex like nothing happened. When the Armenians blow up Darryl's car, they still stay living at this complex. What? If you double cross ANY mob, shouldn't you think about relocating? Then dopey Darryl falls for one of the hookers. Geez. The Armenians plot further revenge by shooting up the SAME complex that these idiots are still staying in. This ends up with Terry getting shot and now Ray and Mick want vengeance on these Armenians, who Mick ended up setting up brielfy with a badly written police/fbi/sting story.

The were so many holes throughout this season. For some seasons, Ray ends up seeing...his dead sister? I believe...I am not even sure as it was never explained and then quickly dismissed. In one scene, Ray gets shot in the stomach, yet all he does is change his shirt and that's it? No hospital, no stitching, no nothing. He does so much stuff, before he finally passes out in a church. Anyone who works with Mick, ends up getting screwed over, eg Terry in jail (season 2), Bunchy arrested, Darry's car blowing up, yet these idiots don't want Mick to leave because he is what, such a nice guy? This makes no sense. Ray is the only one who can see that Mick is a scumbag, yet he is always doing scummy things to everyone. Only at the end does Darryl finally see the light. In one scene, Avi, says he plants a ""d##k pic"" on Cochran's computer and sends it to all his coworkers so that Cochran can be fired, yet nothing ever happens with this.

One of the main points I think in the series, is that Ray, the LA fixer, can fix anything but his own family. I get that. But there should be a little more common sense among them to not do some of the things they do. Ray prides himself on family, yet cheats on his wife constantly, barely deals with his kids, when in actuality, he would be thriving in his life if he was a single, unattached man. So why did he get married and have kids? He was so mad at Avi for what he did at the end of Season 2, but that is what they do for a living, so what did he expect? Plus that reporter from season 2 was annoying as hell, just like Abby, but maybe better looking.

Elements of this season were good and I still like the show, but I think the writing on this season was far inferior to the previous 2 seasons. Here is hoping season 4 get back on point.

If I missed anything that didn't make any sense or something else that was left out, please let me know.

Also, if I misinterpreted anything, let me know. I'd like to know what I missed.",1468195200,2,8342,4.364046391752577

But I can't believe that every single person reviewing the dvd release of the 3rd season gave this 5 stars and didn't subtract at least one for the fact that this should have been a 3 disc release, and not 4, because putting a single episode on the last disc (which could have easily fit on the third disc) was merely an excuse to include episodes of some other Showtime series as a promotional ploy.  Shameless and inexcusable.  Glad I decided to wait a little longer to get this from my library and make my own copy rather than buy it.",1454716800,,580,4.302752293577981
