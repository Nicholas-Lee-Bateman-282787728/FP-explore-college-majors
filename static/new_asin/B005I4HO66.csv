4708064,5,B005I4HO66,"This boxset is amazing, worth every penny I paid for it, the presentation is superb, very classy and mature, and the images are great, the quality of the sound and picture are pristine, Utena never looked better! this is really a MUST HAVE if you are Utena fan, and if you haven't seen this series, purchase this boxset, you WON'T regret it!",1361145600,,341,4.516129032258065
4708065,5,B005I4HO66,"I watched Revolutionary Girl Utena for the first time about 11 years ago on VHS. When Central Park Media released it on DVD about eight years ago, I bought all the DVDs and watched the series again. Recently, I stumbled on these remastered, ""Limited Edition"" boxed sets for Utena. I wasn't sure if I wanted to take the plunge and re-purchase what I already owned - however, to those who were in the same position as I was, just do it! As of this review, Amazon is offering these box sets at an incredibly low price. If I could have seen into the future, I would have held off on buying those overpriced CPM DVDs... but, I guess that's just more Utena on my shelf.

After the bankruptcy and liquidation of CPM, many feared that Utena would be out of print indefinitely. Fortunately, RightStuf/Nozomi has stepped in and released these box sets. The box sets are beautiful and the picture quality is a cut above the Central Park version. Furthermore, the sound, now in 5.1, is far clearer and may be better appreciated by those with a 5.1 setup in their home theaters. The extras are a nice bonus, and the booklets provided with the sets are nice as well.

Concerning the actual show, most people considering this purchase have probably already seen Utena. For those who have not, Utena has emerged as a modern classic among quite a few anime critics. It was positively regarded a decade ago, and appreciation for the show has only increased over time. A product review can't even begin to encapsulate this show. Utena's production team is frequently called the ""dream team"" of anime, with renowned animator Shinya Hasegawa, weirdo (but awesome) director Kunihiko Ikuhara, manga artist Chiho Saito, et al. They split after making Utena, and IMHO none of them have made anything close to Utena in terms of quality (not even Ikuhara's latest show, Mawaru Penguindrum comes close although graphically stunning).

Anyone who does a little research is going to find that this show is very heavy on the psychological and philosophical front. It is, in my interpretation, very existential and feminist. When I was a teenager, I did not appreciate the many ""levels"" on which this show operates. I thought it was a show with a bunch of rebellious hot girls who kicked a lot of you-know-what and that was good enough for me. In fact, I was reluctant to watch the show again, thinking it'd be a waste of time as I'd seen it twice before already. However, re-watching the show recently as an adult, I find the show much more satisfying intellectually, and have gained a far deeper respect for the sorts of messages that the show puts forth. Ultimately, the dazzling visuals and wonderful soundtrack are secondary to the narrative drive. Regardless, it should be said the artwork is top notch (especially in the third and final season - not to mention the movie; this box set) and the music is memorable. Years later, Utena's rock opera duel themes still stick in my mind. Utena, like any other work of art, is the sort of thing that leaves you with a different impression every time you experience it.

I have to agree with critical and popular consensus that Utena is a visual and intellectual masterpiece that anyone with an open mind should take a moment to watch. Because the original film stock has degraded over the years, the hope of an HD BluRay release is pretty distant. Whether you are new to the series, or watching it again for the nth time, THIS is the version to watch/get.",1347494400,9,3473,4.688524590163935
4708066,5,B005I4HO66,"I absolutely love this last boxset as it has the nicest booklet yet with plenty of interviews, lineart drawings and pictures of the Japanese cast. The picture quality is really clean just like in the previous two boxsets. This set has six DVDs with four of them being committed to the series finale, one for the movie and one for extras. The extras are quite nice as it includes extras for both the TV series and Adolescence of Utena. The TV series extras includes interviews, karaoke, in Japanese, animated art boards and more. The movie extras includes behind the scenes, Japanese remastered DVD boxset movie spoiler spot and some trailers. Overall, it's pretty nice as I always enjoy cast interviews and behind the scenes stuff. The only bad thing is they didn't remaster the extras. Overall, I'm very happy with all three boxsets as this is a must have for any Utena fan. The only thing that could have made this set even nicer is if they could have somehow added an interview with Rachel Lillis, one of my favorite American voice actress. Like in the previous releases, how can they do a cast interview and not have the main character?",1323388800,14,1140,4.676616915422885
4708067,5,B005I4HO66,"if you like heavy symbolism and dramatic art, then you should really buy it. if not you should at least watch it. both the anime and the movie are excellent",1415059200,,156,4.233333333333333
4708068,5,B005I4HO66,I find that the dvds themselves look kinda cheap but that aside I think that if you are a die hard fan of Utena you should definitely pick up all the box sets. They all come with great art books and this box set in particular also contains the movie. Don't wait to pick this up !,1396224000,,279,3.912280701754386

4708074,5,B005I4HO66,"Having been a fan of Utena for some years, I was delighted to find out that a new transfer had been released.  This box set is the final collection of episodes in the series, and it also includes the Utena movie and an extra disc for bonus features.  The packaging features beautiful artwork (don't forget there is another piece of art on the back of the case; it's hidden under a promotional flyer!) and an impressive book with interviews and series information. The show: the video is much more crisp than the previous release; the colors are wonderfully vibrant.  The Dolby 5.1 audio is much appreciated, especially in scenes featuring music, environmental sound effects, and the duels.",1382400000,,689,4.871794871794871
4708075,5,B005I4HO66,"I was not expecting, when I purchased this set, for the movie to come along with it. I was expecting to have to buy a regular copy of the movie, which wouldn't be remastered the same way as the show. Lovely surprise!

Let's talk about the show for a minute -- you have not seen Utena until you have seen a full remaster. Already visually stunning, going from these discs to uploads of the episodes online, even my old DVDs, there's such an intense difference in color quality that old versions are just depressing to watch.",1379030400,6,523,4.447916666666667

8474155,5,B005I4HO66,"Got it in perfect condition. Thank you for that. As for the show, you get as much as you put in. It can be a mind f***, but if you can make it through neon genesis evangelion, you can enjoy this. I'd even go as far as saying this may be even more allegorical. Also, 10x less whining.

Also, watch the previous two sagas. This show is worth your time.",1496880000,,350,4.0
8474156,5,B005I4HO66,"This is the 3rd and final box set of the anime and its absolute perfection. In the 1st box set i was hooked, and by the 2nd box set i have 2 admit i did start 2 loose interest a bit because it was so repetitive. But all the episodes in this box set went on a completely new direction from box set 1 and 2. The show stopped being so repetitive and predictable, and started 2 create a TON of drama. I could no longer guess what was going 2 happen next, the anime went from being a fun cartoon for kids to an extremely entartaining adult anime with so many twist and turns. I was surprised to see so many adult themes of lust and incest, i was rushing home from work everyday just to watch the next episode. What surprised me the most is that in other animes, when an innocent main character is introduced, they tend 2 stay innocent through out the entire anime, they never make the wrong choices and are usually good role models to the viewers. But this anime takes a different course in direction. The main character here starts off as the perfect role model for young women viewers, but towards the final episodes of the show, well lets just say she does something so wrong and forbidden, no woman in reality should ever do. I loved the evil message the young woman viewers might have received from the main character, that its ok to fall pray to temptation because, it doesnt matter if its wrong, forbidden, or who you are going to hurt, the irresistable pleasure is worth it. I highly recommend this box set.",1477180800,,1510,4.320422535211268

Fair warning though: the plot is so convoluted and psychological you may experience a brain meltdown. Don't try to understand it. Just experience it.",1431561600,2,317,4.781818181818182
