7991056,5,B00009KNWW,The son character gets into situations that are funny yet a learning situation.  She's spunky but lovable.  The artists in these cartoons have drawn them so beautifully.  The scenes and backgrounds are heavenly.  I wish I could visit this little area in this cartoon!,1472342400,,267,5.0
