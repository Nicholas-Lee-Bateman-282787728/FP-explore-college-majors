8712985,4,B00WEWAALQ,"Husband, mom, and dad all enjoyed this movie. All the music was good.
Packaging was good and came brand new sealed. All in all very pleased!",1480723200,,140,4.423076923076923
8712986,1,B00WEWAALQ,"A totally blatant call for Indian nationalism verging on the ultra.  Based on highly dubious historical claims of Colonial India having flown the first manned airplane in the late 1890s. A fine performance by the great Mithun Chakraborty is not enough to save this film. Buy or stream ""OMG-Oh My God"" or better still watch Mani Ratnam's immortal ""Guru"" (with Abishek Bachchan and Aishwarya Rai - based on the life of Indian billionaire Dhirajlal Hirachand ""Dhirubhai"" Ambani) where Chakraborty gives the performance of his life as the editor of the newspaper who mentors Abishek/Gurukant/Ambani to greatness.",1449619200,,608,5.333333333333333
