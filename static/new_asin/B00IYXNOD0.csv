6305549,5,B00IYXNOD0,"An excellent blend of horror and comedy. The background music gave it an 80s feel at times which fits with the type of movie, this would definitely have fit right in with other 80s horror movies (aka the best era of horror). There was a more psychological horror than physical horror and they nailed it perfectly, allowing you to watch as the characters slowly unravel into insanity.

Similar to a lot of horror movies of this type, the movie was lacking in the male department as the focus was more on the girls. There were only 3 guys total and each was very different. Joe Kidd is just a small supporting role but he did well. Eric Widing was a typical frat-boy douche who you could tell had a blast acting in that way! Mike Hilinski played a normal guy who is trying to look good for a girl he's crushing on. I could definitely relate to his character, getting annoyed at the douche friend who was acting out and making him look bad.

All the females were great, with different personalities for each. I've seen too many horror movies where all the females are written as generic and stereotypical but definitely not here.

I enjoyed how the writing did not seem forced for the actors. The dialog was very casual and something you could expect yourself to say in those situations. Sometimes in horror movies there will be excessive cursing simply to have cursing, but that was not the case here.

Only complaint? Who in their right mind tries to get spaghetti from a pot with a normal spoon?!? That's the most I can complain!",1405382400,,1529,4.528985507246377
6305550,4,B00IYXNOD0,"Ill admit that with Haunted House on Sorority Row as the title, I was expecting more of a sex romp turned splatterfest, but was pretty surprised to find the film took on a more psychological horror angle and kept the nudity down to just under the gratuitous level. Legitimate creepy atmosphere and some nicely edited jump scares carry you through the film, and there is just the right amount of humor to keep it from getting tedious.
Dalton turned in an intelligent script. He and Couto together managed to create an air of uneasiness throughout the film, and kept this audience member guessing at what, when, why and how the next tidbit of information would present itself. It left me genuinely surprised when the those tidbits came with legitimate scares.
""Haunted House"" is filled with recognizable faces from the Couto films including, Joni Durian, Erin R. Ryan, Haley Madison, and Mike Hilinski. All the cast handled the story really well, despite it being maybe a little different from what they may have been used to. With few exceptions, the characters seemed very real. The few that pushed the limit of what might be considered over-the-top were often reined in by the script and the other characters. Other characters often gave those over-actors the eye rolls and insults that may well have been expressed by the audience, had they been given the chance.",1405296000,3,1365,4.887931034482759
8646681,4,B00IYXNOD0,"It's horror with a psychological angle that deals with sexual trauma!  Other reviewers comment that there is too much dialogue, but I didn't think so, and I liked the dialogue.  That's where some of the visuals are explained.

Joni D., who played Alex, was great and can do so much with her unblinking, piercing gaze.

I also liked how Henrique did NOT tilt the scales towards plus-size nudity, as he has done in Babysitter Massacre.  The writing was also better here. It also shows that something interesting can be produced without Hollywood's (which is the real horror) money or interference.

Eric Widing, as Jim, delivers the funniest line when he says, regarding the haunted house, ""I'd be embarrassed to put a meth lab here""!",1471737600,2,732,4.862903225806452
8646682,3,B00IYXNOD0,"It was A enjoyable film the cast where good, but there was to much talk and the women showing to much the special effects could,ve been better and then come on A Sorority house where's the college. A bunch girls move into A house not realizing the danger they may face.  The ending looked like something you seen before but not this time.",1454889600,2,338,4.365079365079365
8646683,1,B00IYXNOD0,"The only thing frightening about this movie was that I paid for it. The special effects were old in the 1970's: canned soup ""vomit"", blood running down a mirror, ghosts with bad makeup looking into the camera, etc. The acting was pretty amateurish. Dialogue was flat and silly. The background story to the haunted house was nothing new and pretty lame: Bad guys kill prostitutes. If there was an explanation as to why the bad guys were now ghosts trapping the prostitute ghosts inside the house I missed it. At any rate, prostitute ghosts kill dirt bag men inside the house while dirt bag men ghosts try to kill everyone else. At the start a young couple is killed, although not shown how. The next and last death is a dirt bag guy who lived way too long. Apparently, the way to defeat these ghosts is to admit past sexual trauma and fall asleep. I give this movie one star for its only redeeming quality: It came to an end.",1452556800,,924,4.4411764705882355

8646685,1,B00IYXNOD0,"Junior High School drama class meets Ed Woods! Over the top oatmeal/ pea soup vomit, gross. It was rated 6.5 on IMDB so I bought it on Prime- WHAT A MISTAKE. Easily the worst movie I've seen in 2014 and I try to see all the horror/ science fiction movies that come out. That's my favorite genre. I have over 3000 science fiction/ horror DVDs and Blu Rays, I won't be adding this one!
Do yourself a favor and pass on this one.",1419811200,,425,4.132530120481928
8646686,4,B00IYXNOD0,"was a bit worried at the start of this movie, but after the credits rolled, this movie became a fun ride!
Haunted House on Sorority Row (2014)-A fledging sorority moves into a dilapidated house only to find something evil is lurking in the shadows. Is it an elaborate hazing ritual? Or is something sinister - something paranormal - behind the mental and physical assault?
I won't throw the whole movie out in detail, I am just going to cap on the best parts and what I liked.
Let me just start off by saying the dvd menu was creepy, that made me sit up with my eyes wide open. hearing a music box has always made my skin crawl. The bathroom scene with the puke and shower was so gross. it makes a lot to make me gag or make my stomach turn, that scene hit the spot. The Jim character...even tho not much death in this movie HE NEEDED TO DIE! my wishes were fulfilled. There are a lot of weird moments like there's a scene where the main character is in a field looking into a glass mirror and blood starts going down it. Another thing to keep in mind this film has a good bit of nudity in it. I like how Couto made this movie feel creepy. Yes it is low budget but it is a fantastic film and I enjoyed it and I recommend it to anyone who hasn't seen it. So for those ghostly,haunting,nude,creepy movie type lover you will love this movie.
Over all this movie is fun for anyone who loves horror movies and I give it a 10/10.",1413849600,,1423,4.159420289855072

8646688,3,B00IYXNOD0,"Babysitter Massacre, Bleeding Through, Depression were much more entertaining.

I don't know why, this one simply didn't hold my interest. I think what killed it for me, were the male characters. Every time they were on-screen I wanted to fast-forward (I didn't), one was a jerk and the other a wimp. Their dialog was just awful.

Moving on, this is a fairly well made low budget movie and the female leads held their own, even if Erin Ryan was wasted in a nothing role.

Not a bad movie, just populated by somewhat annoying characters. I would say watch at your own risk.",1410048000,3,572,4.588235294117647
8646689,4,B00IYXNOD0,"Haunted House On Sorority Row is a high quality low-budget film that serves up plenty of thrills, chills, and boobs. Henrique Couto has become quite efficient at producing great-horror and he has stepped up the game quite a bit. This is only one of several projects that he has produced and released in the past year and a half. He has three more coming!

Henrique is on a mission for domination over the low-budget horror genre! If this is any indication and this looks to be the case. He will continue growing as a filmmaker, he will continue producing quality horror, and maybe in the not so distant future more people will take notice of his work. He certainly deserves a bigger audience and I hope it gets it.",1406937600,,714,4.534883720930233
8646690,5,B00IYXNOD0,"If there is one thing to be learned from the happenings in independent film over the last few years, it is that Henrique Couto is a rising star.  Couto is a master story teller and visionary director.  He knows what he wants and how to get it when filming.  His most recent film, Haunted House on Sorority Row, was his most collaborative to date when it comes to bringing in other professionals to create his art.  Obviously, this collaborative nature of the film worked out for Couto.  Not only is his upcoming project, Scarewaves, an even greater example of Couto's new level of collaboration, but Haunted House on Sorority Row was a standout film by an already accomplished film-maker.
