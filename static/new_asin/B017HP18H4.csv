The other ""Love Finds You in Sugar Creek "" is also about three Amish sisters who entertained a famous baseball player.  I hope they have the DVD'S for  all ""Love Finds You"" series",1452297600,,243,4.260869565217392
7506777,4,B017HP18H4,"Thank you Anchor Bay for sending us this DVD to review!

Love Finds You in Charm is based on the book Love Finds You in Charm, Ohio by Annalisa Daughety.  Its about a young Amish woman named Emma Miller who fantasizes about living outside of the Amish community and doesnt feel like she belongs.  To make matters worse, Emma feels that she is failing as a role model for her younger sister with her reading habits and longing to explore the world before deciding to join the Amish community.

If Emma chooses to become a member of the Amish church, she has a marriage offer from Jacob who cares for her more than she does for him.
While she has a good life ahead of her in Indiana, Emma cant help but wonder what the outside world has to offer.  Sensing her discontentment, Emmas father sends her to her cousins farm for the summer to lend a hand during the tourist season.  Her cousin is a recent widow that lives in another Amish community in Charm, Ohio.  Without much hesitation, Emma packs her bags and hops on a train.

In Ohio Emma meets Noah, a young, handsome, and well-read man that understands much of her struggles.  She also befriends Kelly, an outsider (Englisher as the Amish call them) who is retreating to Ohio to live a more peaceful life.  Another outsider named Andy takes notice of Emma and her award winning goat cheese.  As a blogger of wine and cheese, hes well-travelled and offers to take her along with him.

With so many temptations and men interested in her, Emma must discover the right path and decide which man she wants to spend her future with.  My husband (despite making some chick flick cracks) and I enjoyed watching this film together and recommend it for anyone fascinated with the Amish or love triangles in general.",1452297600,11,1757,4.5396825396825395
7506778,4,B017HP18H4,"Love Finds You in Charm is a TV movie about a young Amish woman who reads Jane Austen and dreams of seeing the world. Beautiful Emma Miller (Danielle Chuchran) has a loving family and a marriage offer from the communitys most eligible young man. Her future seems assured. Yet she yearns for adventure and romance. Asked to help her widowed cousin in Ohio run her business, she jumps at the chance to see what else the world has to offer.

Settling into life on her cousins farm, Emma befriends local librarian Kelly Bennett (Tiffany Dupont) and gets to know Noah (Trevor Donovan), a striking, well-read young Amish man who helps work the farm. When Emmas popular homemade cheese attracts the attention of handsome wine-and-cheese blog editor Andy (Drew Fuller), she finds herself pulled between two men and two worlds.

Borrowing heavily from Austens Sense and Sensibility, Love Finds You in Charm is a pleasant movie about wanting more, weighing choices, staying with what is comfortable or moving into unknown territory, and the importance of pursuing a path of ones own choosing. Ms. Chuchran is an appealing actress who conveys sweetness as well as a thirst for independence. In this respect, her Emma is a modern woman despite her old-fashioned upbringing.

There are no bonus features on the DVD release.",1452038400,4,1310,4.972602739726027

Trump has taken the secretive neo Nazi (hatred & destruction of anything progressive) movement into the Main Stream, while Hilary struggles to maintain the right to have the US stay the course for world peace and progress anywhere and everywhere there has been too much suffering: SE Asia, Cent America, the Middle East.

That life was filled with the desire for sex, money and power.  She returns gladly to the life she formerly despised...a life of peace and purpose and true love.

7506907,5,B017HP18H4,"Love Finds You in Charm is a great addition to the Love Finds You... series. It has a twist which I always wondered about; that is, do Amish
youth ever look longingly on the possibility of leaving their roots and how others in their community view their possible defection. I think it was
well acted and had some tension that held my interest.",1468022400,3,343,4.4603174603174605

7506917,2,B017HP18H4,"Overall aside from the book it wasn't a bad movie. Things that bothered me were the fact most of the Amish had no accents which really bothered me and Noah didn't look Amish at all. Also the movie doesn't follow most of the story in the book or was filmed in Charm Ohio, most scenes were in Sugarcreek, Ohio. If I hadn't read the book or didn't live close to Ohio Amish country I probably could of rated it higher.",1459814400,,414,4.1875

She enjoys books and movies about real Amish people or fictional, as in this case, so I'm quite sure she'll enjoy it.
