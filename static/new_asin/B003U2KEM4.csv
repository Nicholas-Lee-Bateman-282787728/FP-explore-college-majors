4194122,5,B003U2KEM4,"Ira Israel's new DVD ""Yoga for Depressioin and Anxiety"" is one of the best, if not the best, yoga dvds I've yet come across. I've been practicing for over 17 years now and have a stack of dvds that reaches from the floor to my shoulders but I've never ecnountered an instructor with such insight and basic knowledge as Mr. Israel has. It was a pleasure to use his dvd this morning and I'm sure I'll be feeling the same for many more mornings to come.",1277942400,57,450,4.244186046511628
4194123,5,B003U2KEM4,"I received Yoga for Depression and Anxiety as a gift and although I don't suffer from either, I am really impressed with the DVD and therefore leaving a review.  I highly recommend this DVD.  Ira Israel is a natural, making you feel comfortable with the practice and explaining all the steps that I somehow have missed in my yoga classes at the gym.  If you like having someone guide you through your yoga practice and through the meditation as I do, this DVD is a great solution when you don't feel like dealing with a crowded class.

I would love to take one of his classes or have a private session or two but since I'm not in CA, this DVD provides a great alternative.  An added plus is that his voice is very calming and he's cute too!  Make sure to buy this DVD.. I'm looking forward to the next one!",1277856000,5,806,4.269736842105263

4194193,3,B003U2KEM4,I'm going to have to revisit this dvd when i get better at practicing Yoga. As a beginner it was a little hard for me to follow but as i progress i can see it being very enjoyable,1418688000,,179,3.736842105263158
4194194,2,B003U2KEM4,"I wish I had read all of the reviews including the 3 and 2 star comments before buying this dvd.  I had to stop doing the yoga within 30 minutes of this 75 minute practice because it is not for beginner/intermediate students.  I have never seen many of these poses before in my yoga studio.  I have been practicing on and off for 4-5 years and consider myself to be in pretty good shape for a 55 year old woman.  But this is one continuous 75 minute flow of advanced yoga with Ira explaining only as you are actually doing the pose.  Since it is 75 minutes long, it is not worth reviewing the whole dvd periodically to learn the poses before doing them.  And many of them, including the headstands, are poses I don't feel would be smart for me to try to do alone. All yoga is beneficial for depression and anxiety so I am not sure how this one is any better.  It is actually made me feel annoyed and discouraged because too many poses are not practical for the average non-advanced or middle-aged person.

On a positive note, I enjoyed his 5-minute introduction about depression and anxiety and wished he would have included more of this throughout the video.",1414800000,7,1159,4.408450704225352

4194201,3,B003U2KEM4,This yoga video would  have been so much better if one of the two people in the video could have stayed with beginner poses. Several of the poses were impossible for me to do so I just sat and watched in awe for a few portions of the video such as the headstand :)  I will keep at it.,1389916800,4,284,3.7966101694915255

Even though the workout is done at a slower pace than I'm used to, I actually feel like I achieve a better work out both physically and mentally.  I would recommend this work out not only to those suffering from anxiety and depression ( does help so much) but also  to anyone interested in learning or understanding yoga. The instructor and the woman following are phenomonal at explaining and perfectly modeling many of the core yogi poses and breathing technique that is so important to achieving peace and rejuvenation as well as getting a truly great total body work out!",1389744000,6,783,4.578571428571428

4194206,2,B003U2KEM4,"I wanted to like it; I really did.  I love yoga.  I do it almost daily, but there were things about this DVD I did not like. There were several things that bugged:  1) Ira (the instructor) is slow in describing things or repetitive 2) Low production quality of the video 3) The music was annoying instead of a nice background effect 4) The transitions were so slow it just seemed to drag on too long.",1374451200,3,400,4.2368421052631575
4194207,4,B003U2KEM4,"The workout was steady, consistent and wholesome. The dvd is not an instructional dvd for beginners but rather a programmed workout to keep one moving, stretching, exercising and getting a good sweat going. Thus, a certain amount of prior Yoga experience is required if one wants to keep up with the regiment, how-ever, no head-standing abilities required. Certainly worth the money as 1 yoga class in by itself could cost as much as the DVD, but again, prior yoga knowledge is important but not absolutely essential.",1373932800,6,517,5.023255813953488
4194208,1,B003U2KEM4,"How could anyone like this video? The man has a lot of ego, no flow in his voice, nothing to do with depression or anxiety, odd title, and not interesting and engaging in the least",1373500800,4,180,4.171428571428572
4194209,3,B003U2KEM4,"I was really hoping this DVD would live up to its promise but unfortunately it fell far short in my opinion. The setting is just a standard workout room, the music is nothing special, and the way the instructor speaks is not calming or relaxing at all. I was expecting a DVD that offered a lot more opportunity for deep relaxation and meditation, not just a basic sun salutation repeated over and over that you could find at your local YMCA yoga class.

All that being said, if you are just looking for a good beginner's yoga routine and don't care about how they deliver it then it's just fine, which is why I gave it three stars instead of less. However if you want something more relaxing (and more challenging/physically beneficial) I would recommend anything by Rodney Yee way before this. I especially like his Power Yoga DVD. It does a lot more for my depression and anxiety than this ever could.",1370563200,3,903,4.539877300613497
4194210,2,B003U2KEM4,"The packaging..all the promo looked great but I was very disappointed with this yoga dvd because it looks old...it appears to have been an older tape etc. that has been converted to dvd. That is not a negative per se, but I was disappointed with the look of all of it.  The yoga cannot be done by beginners, overweight, older....there are NO alternatives provided for the postures, that is another reason I believe this is older because newer teachers do not want you to be hurt and they provide an alternative to assist you as a beginner.  Anxiety is a problem for me, this unfortunately is not for me.  If you have been doing yoga for quite awhile you might be able to accomplish the balance and flexibility necessary for these moves.",1369612800,4,736,4.5606060606060606

4194273,2,B003U2KEM4,"I'm glad I rented this product before buying it. The only part related to anxiety or depression is the introduction (which by the way is also the only part of the DVD where I could actually understand what he was saying), other than that, like the instructor said ""all yoga is good for anxiety or depression"", so my recommendation is to go ahead and get another one where the sound quality has been taking care off so you don't have to look at the screen to see what is going on.
It wasn't a bad routine by itself and I really wanted to like it, but I couldn't go past the fact that the focus was not what the title promise, or maybe he said more about It but it's just impossible to hear or understand.",1366502400,2,703,4.176470588235294
4194274,4,B003U2KEM4,"I enjoyed the video. The music in the backround was soothing, and very fitting. His poses were reasonable, but challenging. The video was a little long though, half way through i got a little bored. In the end your body feels refreshed.",1365897600,3,236,4.642857142857143
4194275,3,B003U2KEM4,"Although the quality is good and the instruction was interesting and helpful, it had a pretty serious downside: it was more difficult than I expected. The description says the video is all levels, but it was more intermediate. I took three or four semesters of yoga in college, and about 30 minutes into the video I had to stop because the positions were out of my range. Would only recommend to more experienced people.",1365465600,3,420,4.6891891891891895

4194278,5,B003U2KEM4,"I really love this DVD.  I agree with some other reviewers that it is probably not the best yoga dvd to pick up if you are completely new to yoga, if you are looking for a guided meditation with a focus on specifics of anxiety, or if you are going to be turned off by the fact that this is really badly produced.  I have been practicing yoga for 15 years on and off and there are still 2 poses on it that I struggle with and must modify.  That being said I REALLY LIKE that it builds from easy to more strenuous because that assists in keeping me focused.  As it gets harder, I get more and more focused on my breath and form and am not able to worry or let my mind wonder.  Ira also has a very soothing and reassuring tone to his voice.  I love when he says ""AND we're gonna RISE UP...""",1362009600,6,787,3.949367088607595
4194279,5,B003U2KEM4,I could follow around and I found the flow to be fluid and all of the narrator's comments made total sense to me.  He seems to really care about wanting to help me and help people get out of their bad moods and depression.  Definitely worth a try by anyone who seems to be in bad moods more often than not.,1361404800,5,306,4.0
4194280,4,B003U2KEM4,Excellent video with full stages of a yoga practice. I like the instructor's voice and the way he explains each pose. If anything the video is a little long.,1360108800,,157,4.448275862068965
4194281,3,B003U2KEM4,"It's okay, I prefer a nicer setting. I felt it helped with depression and overall needed stretching, a little advanced for me since I am a beginner but I was able to adjust.  Transaction was great though! Thanks!",1360022400,,212,4.578947368421052
4194321,1,B003U2KEM4,"I wish I had read the other 1-star reviews for this video before purchasing from my Roku. What a waste--as others have noted in great detail, the ONLY tie-in to its claim of being good for stress or feeling low is that ALL YOGA is good for anxiety, depression, and for that matter being lazy, having no connection with the universe, being a douche. COME ON!! I blew nearly $14 on this and wish to high heaven I could purge it from my library--which incidentally has amazing kundalini yoga from Maya Feines, Shiva Rea, and others. This is a SUPER LOW production value, poorly scripted, and apparently done  with a stationary camera in a cruddy looking studio with the pukiest green paint ever. DUDE, here's a hint--paint your studio before making a video. I'm sorry to be so brutal, but I'm outraged by the crass look & feel, and by-the-numbers yoga BTW. The only nice part is the intro & exit footage near water. I'll give it to him that he is a good practioner if a terrible cue-giver. And it's in a virtual echo chamber so the bad cues are almost impossible to catch unless you're a foot from the TV, geez. To all other potential buyers, DON'T PURCHASE THIS VIDEO--THERE ARE SO MANY BETTER ONES OUT THERE!! Take the time to read the bad reviews as they usually tip you off to what's very wrong.

NOTE TO AMAZON/Yeah, that's you Mr. Bezos, I would greatly appreciate you living up to Amazon's vaunted return policy for shipped goods (of which I am a FREQUENT BUYER, BUT NEVER A RETURNER UNTIL NOW--and refund at least the balance of what I paid (less the rental charge, perhaps?).

I mean, the videos are very good but he was much more real, caring, and compassionate in the class.  The yoga series he led us through was the same on the video and it definitely made me feel better.  His talk about depression and anxiety in the beginning are awesome!  For people who are looking to get off of medication and find a healthy alternative I think you should try this video.",1358985600,6,563,4.427184466019417

4194326,5,B003U2KEM4,"Ira's comments about depression and anxiety in the beginning are spot on.  I like the way he gets us to take responsibility for our emotions and use yoga and meditation to regulate our emotional lives.  I did this asana practice with Ira at one of his workshops and everyone was beaming afterwards.  He explains the sequencing so lucidly - like nobody else I ever practiced yoga with.  At one point he makes a joke and says that if you're leaning backward you're thinking about something in the past and if you're leaning forward (in the pose) then you're thinking about something in the past.  Right at that moment I looked in the mirror and saw that I was leaning backwards and I was thinking about my ex-boyfriend.  It was freaky.  Anyway, I would highly recommend this DVD - especially if you're traveling and just want to practice in your hotel room in the morning.  And if you get a chance to go to one of his workshops don't hesitate.",1358467200,6,941,4.5266272189349115

I have been fortunate enough to go to Ira's workshops and experience his expertise first hand. I am not a yoga person.

4194330,3,B003U2KEM4,"I don't usually write reviews, but I was so annoyed by this video that I felt compelled to do so.  I'm not sure why it is titled Yoga for Depression and Anxiety.  I think this is very misleading.  As the instructor himself states in the introduction, all yoga is beneficial for depression and anxiety.  He also says that there are some specific poses that may be helpful but that he won't go over those in the video but will just present a basic yoga practice.  Okay, fine, but don't use a title that leads the buyer to believe that this yoga practice is geared specifically towards a certain problem.  The practice in this video is an amalgam of some of the the ashtanga primary series including surya namaskara A and B, a few other standing poses, and a series of twists.  The instructor never mentions the roots of the ashtanga practice or how and why he has adapted the primary series for this video.  Some of the poses are quite challenging even for experienced yoga practitioners (crane into headstand, wheel, natarajasana), and he doesn't provide alternative poses or much instruction on body mechanics.  The ""student"" in the video does have beautiful lines and demonstrates the poses quite well, however it would have been nice to have another person to demonstrate poses that are adapted for less experienced viewers.  Something strange about the way the instructor talked through some of the poses was his habit of saying in a sing-songy voice ""You're gonna breath in, you're gonna breath out"" at various points.  It just sounded odd to me, and I found it distracting.  On a positive note, he did a good job of explaining the poses and movements clearly and did mention less challenging adaptations.",1353974400,5,1709,4.775510204081633

I feel that this workout did help me out a lot throughout the day with my anxiety.  I strongly encourage anyone with anxiety/depression to give this a try.  Even beginners will be able to keep up with this.",1351728000,5,301,4.155172413793103
4194332,5,B003U2KEM4,"I feel this video was one of the best I have found for instruction at home.  Ira may not go into too much depth on why each pose is beneficial to anxiety or depression but ALL yoga benefits anxiety and depression....don't give up or listen to your mind telling you that you can't do it!  At first, yes, it is just doing poses, but something will click, just don't give up!  Also, some have talked about the quality of the video, when you do this series with him a few times you will not have to watch but to only listen to his voice and yourself, which makes it worth the while.  The flow is fluent, which I like so much!  If anything in this video or any in any kind of yoga is challenging...it is probably because you need that challenge in your life!  That is what I have truly learned and have over-came anxiety and depression!  Keep going, and find a class to do locally, yogis are everywhere! This is a great video for home practice for beginners to intermediate for sure!  Good Luck!",1350604800,4,990,4.28494623655914

4194334,3,B003U2KEM4,"If you are a beginner to yoga like me, I would search for something a little more instructive.  As the video progressed, the yoga became difficult for me so I don't feel like I got much out of it.  It was, however, very calming and soothing.",1348099200,3,241,4.217391304347826
4194335,1,B003U2KEM4,"First of all, the pricing Amazon lists is misleading. It's $3.99 to rent the video for 7 days, to buy the video it's over three times that amount.

I rented this instant video when I was feeling particularly low and unable to move from my bed or couch for more than a few minutes at a time. After reading all the glowing reviews I had high hopes that this would help me out of my slump.

No such luck.

There's a three minute or so intro which actually has quite a few gems of advice about depression and anxiety. But when the yoga begins, Ira starts with a standing pose. After a few minutes I couldn't do it anymore. Knowing that the entire workout was 75 minutes long, and how tough it was for me at the very beginning, I quickly became discouraged. I stopped the video and went back to my hibernation state. I found I was too impatient for his pacing and I wish he had started with a lying down pose rather than the traditional standing beginning. I think given the target audience for this video, moving from a lying to sitting to standing position would make a great deal of sense. The sunset over water at the end is nice and all, but I can find that type of thing for free and with better quality in other places.

I completely agree with the other reviews about the production quality of the video, especially given the cost of purchasing the video. I could have shot something that looks and sounds better with my smartphone.

If you're looking for an Amazon Instant Video to help get you out of your depressive slump, I'd recommend buying a shorter workout video at a lower cost. What worked for me? Well, I bought (not rented) Jillian Michael's 30 Day Shred<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Level-1/dp/B00356CO1E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Level 1</a>for $1.99, it's a 20 minute workout only (much more attackable when it's a struggle to get off the couch) and the workout is intense, so it keeps you in the present moment. And really, that's the whole concept behind using yoga or meditation to break through depression and anxiety.",1343347200,13,2081,4.7217630853994494

4194337,5,B003U2KEM4,"Two things struck me about this video.

Firstly, Ira takes the time to address depression and anxiety in the intro of the film.  I enjoyed this teach-in aspect of the video.

Secondly, even though the practice if fairly challenging, it has a relaxed approach.  All levels can benefit from this video.  The vibe is casual.  I like that Ira doesn't enforce perfect fingers, alignment, etc.

Educational & challenging with practical tools.

Nice offering, Ira!",1342137600,5,457,5.081081081081081

Definitely not for beginners, but it doesnt claim to be so I am not sure why people give it low ratings because of that.",1523750400,,272,4.352941176470588

8405608,1,B003U2KEM4,"I'm not sure how this is for anxiety and depression. I love the mindfulness of yoga and this dvd skipped right over that in my opinion. It was the same few moves over and over again, I got bored and ended up doing my own moves. It looks as if it was filmed in a basement. Very little about breathing techniques, not for beginners. I'm glad this wasn't my introduction to yoga or I would be turned off by it completely. I wouldn't recommend this to help with anxiety (the reason I purchased it).",1451520000,2,494,4.26595744680851
