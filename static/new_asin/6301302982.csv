326188,2,6301302982,"The good news is that Fox finally released a Betty Grable musical on DVD, so I'm guessing fans are really happy about that.  The bad news is that, as many have pointed out, they picked one of the worse.  The reason seems pretty obvious: Grable is best remembered nowadays precisely for being a WWII ""Pin-Up Girl"" and, like when this film was first produced, the DVD makers are just banking on that.  Betty Grable musicals were formulaic and not particularly sophisticated.  They relied too heavily on her charms (and showing off her famous legs), but even her charisma cannot do much to save this movie.  If you love Betty Grable no matter what, rejoice the fact that at least one of her musicals is on DVD, if not, then I suggest you skip this one and wait for the DVD release of one of her better movies.",1140134400,5,806,4.45578231292517
326189,2,6301302982,"This film represents the low point in the splashy Grable musicals released by 20th Century Fox during the war and Hollywood cynicism at its worst. If you are not an ardent Grable fan, you'll hate the film.

With Grable's status as THE pinup girl of the war, a great opportunity was available to produce a really memorable film. Unfortunately, the story/script is really appalling, the lowest of low for a studio which was never known for its great screenplays for its musicals. Bruce Humberstone, a frequently poor director, adds nothing. Grable plays a secretary doubling as a night club performer. As far as plot, that is about it.

In typical Fox fashion, the colour and sound are excellent. Grable looks attractive but the makeup is heavy, particularly the bleached blonde hair. She was pregnant during shooting and the costumes have been designed to hide this. One would hope that Martha Raye and Joe E Brown would help but the material is so bad that they are just noisy and distracting. Most of the songs are lousy too - duds like ""Don't Carry Tales"". Two redeeming feature - the song ""Once too Often"" as Hermes Pan and Grable perform a tame Apache dance and the title tune, nicely sung by Grable in close up.

It should be noted that the print of the film in this DVD is excellent and among the extras is an entertaining deleted number which can be seen already in the Hidden Hollywood series. Richard Shickel's commentary, however, while providing lots of information, is delivered with so little vitality that it is hard not to go to sleep.",1138752000,,1550,4.712177121771218

326191,3,6301302982,"It is WONDERFUL that FOX is releasing some Betty Grable movies once again...and finally on DVD!!  ""Pin Up Girl"" was primarily a

follow up to the release of millions of copies of her famous pin up picture in 1943.  It is a typical Fox Musical...with a large dash of vaudeville (roller skating specialties) and Our Betty playing a secretary (watch her take off her glasses and WOW just about everybody!)...who pretends to be a musical comedy star.  There is A BIG NAME BAND and Betty dances with

Hermes Pan!  O.K....we watch Betty because she is a great entertainer (and by popular demand, A PIN UP)...her films are

bright and colorful light entertainment.  Betty suffers the

embarassment of plots that bring on migraine, but Betty is a

trouper.  Bottom line: you will LOVE BETTY...not the movie. We can hope that this will triger the release of some of Betty's

films that have never been on video of any kind.  I would really prefer to buy my Betty Grable movies from Fox than from mysterious people on e-Bay and I sincerely hope that this means we will soon be able to do that!  Please bring us ""Coney Island"", ""Sweet Rosey O'Grady"", ""The Dolly Sisters"", ""Mother Wore Tights""....and everything she made between 1950 and 1955.

Betty Grable was a wildly popular star.  Some of her plots are

a little threadbare by now...but BETTY will always be THE WOMAN WE WON THE WAR FOR and a phenomenal popular entertainer.  Thanks for bringing her back to us.  THREE stars for the movie.

For BETTY: a THOUSAND!!",1131667200,46,1507,4.7011494252873565
326192,4,6301302982,"PIN-UP GIRL isn't one of Betty Grable's better offerings; it was quickly thrown together to take advantage of Grable being the Number One pin-up girl during WW2 (hence the title).  A very young Martha Raye gets a great supporting role as wisecracking Marian, and Betty Grable gives her all in the leading role.

Betty Grable plays Lorry Jones, a War Department typist who doubles as a  USO entertainer desperate to hit the big time.  Her penchant to tell tall tales lands her in all sorts of trouble as she fibs her way into the company of handsome war hero Tommy Dooley (John Harvey) by pretending she is a big musical star.  Further complications arise when she is appointed as his secretary.

Not at all in the same league as the flashy SPRINGTIME IN THE ROCKIES or MOON OVER MIAMI, the movie of PIN-UP GIRL absolutely pales in comparison.  Betty Grable gives her usual ten-million-dollar performance and makes everything come together, but only just.  Without her this movie would have never been made, it was tailored completely to her media profile at the time, and Grable fans are the only ones who will only really appreciate this movie.",1111276800,12,1145,4.776649746192893
326193,5,6301302982,"This film's finale is a staged rifle drill by dancing girls -- and they perform as well as almost any military unit you will ever see, with Betty Grable calling cadence.  It's worth watching the entire film just to see them march.",1081814400,5,230,4.476190476190476
326194,4,6301302982,"This film, although not one of Grable's best, is still enjoyable.  The plot is rather contrived, but is still humorous.  Some of the songs are corny, but, again, they are still enjoyable.  Due to advancing pregnancy,  producers didn't want to use the ""Song of the Very Merry Widow""  routine.  Instead they substituted one that consisted of Grable leading  girls in complicated military marches.  Although the finale leaves much to  be desired, the film is still enjoyable and was a top money-maker at its  time.",958867200,8,511,4.976190476190476
326195,4,6301302982,"Grable plays Lorry Jones, a stenographer and part-time USO entertainer in this WWII flagwaver. Slight plot concerning fibber Lorry, who gets herself into all kinds of bother with her fancy tales. But she bites off more than  she can chew when she upstages Martha Raye for the attention of Gaudalcanal  hero John Harvey. An unlikely plot, but Grable's sense of comedy and some  expert dancing - with Hermes Pan - gives it lift off. Good support from  Raye and Joe E Brown. The finale must be seen to be believed! Grable as a  drill sergeant?  However it a a perfect piece of parade-ground marching and  should be in every military manual!  Great fun, if you ignore the plot.",933292800,27,673,4.6440677966101696

326218,4,6301302982,"This film really gets to the heart of why Betty Grable was the most popular pin up among the soldiers, marines and sailors of World War 2. Beautiful, warm, charming and totally the girl all of those men wanted to come home to, Betty Grable lights up the screen.

The film itself has some draw backs. The best friend (Dorothea Kent) sort of disappears 2/3 of the way through. The leading man (John Harvey) has none of the charm or the screen presence that Fox's typical leading men of the period normally had. I'm certain that if this had not been made during the height of the war (when most of Fox's leads were in the service), Victor Mature, John Payne or maybe even Tyrone Power would've been in this. Even runner up James Ellison would've been better.

I also want to say that the person who did the commentary (critic Richard Schikel) didn't really check his facts. Betty Grable was from St. Louis, MO (not Kansas, as he says) and a few other glaring mistakes. Very sloppy! I can't believe Fox would find this acceptable.",1401580800,,1026,4.510752688172043

I had only seen Betty Grable in one other movie, called ""How To Marry A Millionaire"". That movie had me interested to see other movies that Betty Grable had been in. I also wanted to get a better look at her million dollar legs (Grable's legs were insured with Lloyds of London for One Million dollars), which do look exactly like mine when I was around her age. Betty Grable is such a loveable character, something about her you just like, with her confident persona and her beautiful looks. The movie I found to be very entertaining. The DVD came with lobby cards, which I loved to look at. This is a movie worth watching. It made me wonder what she would do next.
The back of the DVD reads as follows:
""Miss Grable in Technicolor is luscious to look at."" -Hollywood Citizen News

Hilarious situation spring up all over in this musical comedy about a girl who simply can't stop telling lies.
Famed World War II pin-up girl Betty Grable stars as Lorry, the most popular girl at the USO in a small midwestern town. En route to a new job in Washington, D.C., Lorry , a secretary, takes a detour to New York, where she and a friend crash a ritzy nightclub, and Lorry pretends to be a Broadway star. This provides a backdrop for lavish production numbers, with Gable in gorgeous gowns showing her glorious gams. Comic actors Martha Raye and Joe E. Brown fill out the cast, joined by the swing orchestra of Charlie Spivak and the Stardusters sing group.

326224,4,6301302982,"I've read a lot of mixed reviews about this film. It's not surprising, as 20th Century Fox was not the musical leviathan that MGM was. The first time I saw it, I groaned a bit at a long routine consisting of Betty Grable drilling a group of WACs. But there's a lot of fun to be had in ""Pin-Up Girl."" Betty had really good comic timing, and in this film she's very charming. The music is enjoyable as well. There is a great number featuring Betty dancing with Hermes Pan, a prolific choreographer of the thirties, forties and fifties who resembled Fred Astaire in looks and ability. I also liked a number done by a group on roller skates, and Martha Raye is her usual non-mousy self. Most of the music is of its time, and that's one of its best qualities. As music goes out of schools and history goes untaught in an honest manner, people's myopia about other times and places tends to grow. ""Pin-Up Girl"" could be a good teaching tool in spite of its small shortcomings.",1292544000,2,970,4.394444444444445
326225,5,6301302982,"Betty Grable was a knockout in movies. Beauty, great acting a true pinup girl. This movie only brings out a great talent in Betty Grable.

326266,4,6301302982,"This is a great film if you enjoy silly humor, musical comedy and hair brained high jinx. Betty Grable's character gets into the thick of it with this film when she and a girlfriend head off to Washington for a new start but like Bing Crosby gets talked into stopping in Vermont in White Christmas, Betty Grable convinces her girlfriend to stop in New York City.

After a few white lies the girls find themselves neck deep and more in trouble. If you enjoy classic musical comedies by entertainers such as Ginger Rogers, Judy Garland, Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire you'll laugh and sing along with Pin-Up Girl.",1226966400,3,609,4.638888888888889
326267,3,6301302982,"This movie starring Betty Grable is the typical Grable fare as served up
by Fox in the 40's.  The plot is relatively the same, with the one exceptional spot being the comedic scenes with Joe E. Brown and Martha Raye. For grable fans this is a good opportunity to watch Ms. Grable in action again. The film is short on plot but heavily dosed with some great character actors and songs for Grable.",1208995200,2,395,4.410958904109589
326268,2,6301302982,"This is a third-rate 1940s musical starring the then-megafamous Betty Grable as a small-town girl whose little fibs keep getting her into big trouble.  Actually, things work out pretty well for her: she gets a job headlining a famous nightclub and she marries the man she loves.

What's terrible about this film are the musical numbers: they lack spark and go on way too long, particularly the dreadful ""Skating Vanities"" sequence, which must clock in at at least ten minutes in length.  There's an awful lot of padding here, even for a b-line musical, but like most old movies, it has some fascinating cultural value... There's a not-too-subtle sexual undertone, involving the interactions between USO girls and the military personnel they entertain: the movie opens with a sequence where all three branches of the service implore the hometown gals to be their ""pin-up"", to which the girls demurely reply that they ""know what you mean"" but that they can't give them what they want.  Later, when Grable's character has conned her way into sitting at a war hero's nightclub table, the sailor and his pal assume that she and her friend are call girls that the club owner has arranged for them... They don't quite put it in those terms, but the message is unmistakable.  Nice glimpse into the hormonal rituals of America during wartime... and lots of crazy piled-up hairdos!  (Axton)",1189987200,2,1380,4.926724137931035
326269,4,6301302982,"Betty Grable may have been seven months pregnant when this picture wrapped; but she puts in a fine performance with this musical. She sings well and dances, too. Fox does a marvelous job of hiding the fact that she's pregnant. The plot is razor thin as it was with many musicals of its time; but again the singing and dancing are why people go to see musicals--and you won't be disappointed there.

Grable plays Lorry Jones, a carefree gal who promises her heart to a mere 500 men to make them happy since she figures she'll never bump into them again when World War II is over. Lorry goes to New York for a weekend romp with her friend Kay, played by Dorothea Kent, before the two have to report for their new jobs as stenographers at the Naval Department in Washington. Naturally, the moment the ladies hit New York things begin to happen--and fast. They see the famous war hero Tommy Dooley played by John Harvey at Grand Central Station and there's competition for him right from the start in nightclub singer Molly McKay who is played by Martha Raye. Eventually they all wind up in a nightclub as the romantic sparks begin to fly between Lorry Jones and Tommy Dooley. Several musical numbers later, along with some incredible dancing both on foot and on roller skates, Lorry and Tommy may actually have the chance at a longer term relationship--provided, that is, that Molly, a Marine and the other 499 men Lorry casually said she was engaged to don't get in their way.

As one reviewer notes, I couldn't help but compare this to the great MGM musicals of the day. The two numbers in which the two men tap dance are wonderful; and I also thoroughly enjoyed the colorful number where the beautiful dancing girls wear huge feathers of red, white and blue. However, Grable fans will be the ones who will be the happiest with this movie as it really doesn't quite measure up to other musicals--even the other musicals in which Grable starred while she was at Fox!

The cinematography reflects good judgment and forethought; the characters are well framed within the picture which gives this mid 1940s war time musical a rather ""pure"" and ""conservative, going with the mainstream"" quality. The choreography shines with each and every dance number; I believe that a great deal of work went into figuring out how to stage those musical numbers.

The DVD has a few extras worth noting: you get a deleted scene of Grable singing a song that was cut from the final production; and there is a commentary by Richard Schickel. There are trailers for this movie and three other Fox musicals, too.

After all is said and done, however, this is Betty Grable's movie; and Grable's fans will enjoy Pin-Up Girl the most. The plot is rather thin and the acting by John Harvey is nothing special; but Grable gives a solid performance. Fox takes great advantage of the fact that Grable WAS a ""pin-up girl"" in real life. If you like musicals you'll probably enjoy this one but rate it about a B+. However, true blue Grable fans will love every minute of this movie.",1174953600,4,3047,4.624768946395564
326270,4,6301302982,"It's a shame that all the Fox musicals haven't been released on DVD, especially the gorgeous Technicolor titles featuring Alice Faye, Betty Grable and Carmen Miranda.

Most agree that this wasn't Betty's best film ... the ending is especially weak, although the all-girl marching routine is impressive. The commentary by noted film historian/critic Richard Shickel is not especially helpful and uninspired. His comments on Martha Raye and Joe E. Brown are good but he incorrectly states that this was their only film together ... wrong. They co-starred in ""$1000 A Touchdown"" for Paramount in 1939. And this was Raye's third film with Grable, which Shickel doesn't mention. He also passes up the fact that Raye was married to one of the dancing Condos Brothers in the movie. The notes in the colorful and well-designed DVD liner by film historian Sylvia Stoddard are much more fun and accurate.

The film transfer itself seems a bit on the dark side, but it's still gorgeous.

Thanks, Fox! As a Grable and Raye fan, I've waited for this for a long time!",1145664000,4,1053,4.904494382022472
326271,3,6301302982,"Listening to Richard Schickel's slow delivery will probaby put you to sleep although he does provide some interesting background information on some of the stars in the film.  He states, correctly, that Joe E. Brown will probably be best remembered for his role in ""Some Like It Hot.""  However, he mistakenly states that Tony Curtis was the ""girl"" for the Joe E Brown character when it was actually Jack Lemmon.

Must also agree with the other reviewers that this is a rather forgettable musical with equally forgettable songs.",1143763200,4,527,4.965909090909091
326272,3,6301302982,"In the Golden Age of Hollywood, each studio usually took a stab all various genres, but excelled in only one. Warner Brothers cornered gangster films, with forays into musicals (Busby Berkeley) and noir (Bogart). Universal dabbled in lots of B-films, but succeeded big-time with horror. MGM, of course, produced the best musicals. Fox did melodramas --- especially noir --- with an occasional romp on MGM's musical turf. And usually those romps hit some really bad notes. Witness the first three flicks in their Marquee Musicals series. Daddy Long Legs has Astaire and Caron, Pin-Up Girl has Betty Grable, Week-End in Havana has Alice Faye and Carmen Miranda,  The memory of these films, for the most part, is a lot better than the films themselves. The pleasant but fairly pedestrian scores, thin plots and busy character actors scurrying around propping up the story make for rough going.
