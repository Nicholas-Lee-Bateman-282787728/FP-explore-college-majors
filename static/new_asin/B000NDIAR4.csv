8177292,4,B000NDIAR4,I enjoy reading about cult masters and what they have done and more importantly why people under them where under there spell. I understood the appeal of the Jim Jones (sometimes) and the ufo dude and even the Wacko dude. But this guy oh my goodness didn't understand why. It was very interesting to watch.,1307232000,,306,4.581818181818182
