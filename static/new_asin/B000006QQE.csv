7904860,4,B000006QQE,"Sea Tales; Fatal Victory Nelson at Trafalgar  50 minutes

A History Channel Production.  The title of this good video is a bit misleading, as it is really another video on the life of Nelson, not just on the battle of Trafalgar.  In many ways, it's similar to the other video on Nelson that I have reviewed (see The Makers of British History Horatio Nelson).  There is the usual stuff-Nelson's early life, life in the navy and his battles, and his personal life.  The reenactor who plays Nelson in this video does not interact with the camera and we do not hear him speak. There are clips from movies that liven things up a bit.  Naval historians tell us about various aspects of Nelson's life and navy.  It's a good introduction, but is not terribly exciting, as much of the video deals with Nelson's personal life.  It depicts a brilliant, but flawed man; someone who could be a hero to millions, yet whose personal life was a mess.  I recommend this video.",1130976000,,959,4.555555555555555
