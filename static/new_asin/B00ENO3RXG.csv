Thank you God for your mercy and second chances!!",1390953600,,129,4.375
5928582,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Fantastic movie! So much truth in this story. This is the cleanest PG-13 movie you will ever see. Kind of thought it might be a cheesy low budget film, but was very pleasantly surprised. They definitely kept their cost down, which is commendable, and did a wonderful overall job.",1389657600,31,279,4.714285714285714
5928583,5,B00ENO3RXG,I saw this in the theater and was very impressed. I have seen faith-based movies before and this movie was the best so far. The quality of acting and filming were top-notch and the story was intense and gripping! The movie makers did a great job of telling this story in modern terms. I was impressed and inspired!,1389657600,48,314,4.431034482758621
5928584,5,B00ENO3RXG,"It might be easy to give thanks, be joyful, and be faithful when circumstances are going our way, but not so much when the world has turned its back against us.  This spectacular story reminds us that there is hope in all circumstances, a sovereign plan behind everything, and great joy in remaining faithful and running the race to its end!!!",1389484800,20,343,4.622950819672131
5928585,5,B00ENO3RXG,"This is one of the great stories of God's faithfulness, told in a new context, with integrity and creativity.  I saw a pre-screening of it, and am thrilled to have a DVD copy of it that I can share with friends and family, within and without the family of faith.",1388793600,36,262,4.24
5928586,5,B00ENO3RXG,I saw this in theaters and loved it so much! My biological only sister is in this Megan Parker Wilson. I've been waiting for this for a very long time! Amazing movie!!!,1388275200,12,168,4.28125

5928590,4,B00ENO3RXG,Like it but not one of the best faith based films.  Tells the story of Joseph in modern day and that's a hard thing to do.  It's a keeper though not my favorite.,1517270400,,161,3.8484848484848486
5928591,5,B00ENO3RXG,"A wonderful story of Joseph! It really gets you a deeper perspective of the mistreatment and injustice Joseph in the Bible experienced. Sometimes Bible stories are read just like a story, but this movie helps realize the truth in what happened so long ago, a man who deal with heartache and pain that wasn't his doing, and how God kept him through it all.
There are some slight changes in the narrative but nothing too major - it's a modern day version and flows nicely scene to scene. Learning to love those that hurt us and to forgive because Jesus loves us and forgives us.
A movie for the family.",1516838400,,600,4.463636363636364

5928594,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Excellent movie. I read one review were someone was disappointed it wasn't exactly like the story of Joseph and picked one or two things out that weren't exactly like the Biblical account. I think that was really an unrealistic expectation. It is a very well done movie from story line, to production value, to casting and acting. It serves its purpose, to remind us life is hard and never perfect and you will at some point find yourself (to borrow from another Biblical story)  sitting on an ash heap scraping yourself with broken pottery. But sometimes what we thought was meant for bad is in our life meant for a better good then we can imagine. I not only watched it but bought it. I know Christians will enjoy it and I think there is enough of what I would call ""goodness"" in it that someone who is not a Christian but has a desire to be good can enjoy. Worth watching.",1513814400,2,875,4.401234567901234
5928595,5,B00ENO3RXG,Brilliant movie. I love the concept and this film is amazing. please watch it,1511827200,,77,4.571428571428571

5928597,5,B00ENO3RXG,"When watched with the heart, there will be no criticisms, especially having read the story of Joseph. It was meant to be modern to relate to us today.. I loved that they were 'amateur', actors as some called them. I wasn't looking for famous characters. I was looking to relate to Joseph's story for understanding my own life and the beauty of God's timing. Loved it. Bravo.*****  +++",1503878400,,384,4.647058823529412

5928608,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Great Modern Day Joseph Story

I was a little concerned that the acting was not going to be very good, but this movie is a very well made movie.  The characters we perfectly cast and were so easy to love and to hate.",1480377600,,216,4.0
5928609,5,B00ENO3RXG,"I bought this movie after I watched BEYOND THE MASK, and saw the quality of Andrew Cheney's acting abilities. I wasn't disappointed in Season's of Gray, though Cheney's character is noticeably different than his previous character. The movie is a drama instead of an adventure, but the story is compelling. I thought the film was well worth the purchase.",1480118400,,354,5.016949152542373

5928614,5,B00ENO3RXG,"We love this movie.  Very well done.  It was made by a church in Dallas, near where we live (we don't go to that church).  The story is well written and the actors did a fantastic job.  We actually loaned our copy out and never received it back (thus gifting it to that family, we decided).  I wanted to make sure we have our own copy!",1475625600,,335,4.015151515151516

5928620,5,B00ENO3RXG,I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie.  It is a modern day Joseph story and shows how what was meant for evil turned out to be good..  The main character did a lot of suffering but never lost his faith.  We can all learn a lesson from that. I like watching good clean movies without cursing and nudity.  None of that is needed to tell a story.  Thank you Amazon for making this movie available.,1471219200,,397,4.3108108108108105
5928621,5,B00ENO3RXG,It kept my nephew who is 16 very interested.  He never sits still long enough to watch a movie  It's a good story about Joseph in a modern way.,1469232000,,143,3.896551724137931
5928622,5,B00ENO3RXG,I was pretty impressed when I watched this movie it was a good story for modern times.

5928627,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Very well done. The modern day version, while of course having a different storyline, maintained the overall message of the original biblical account of Joseph.",1465862400,,160,5.44
5928628,5,B00ENO3RXG,"This is a great movie!  The main character goes through so much just like Joseph did in the Old Testament in the HOLY BIBLE.  He finally sees that God loves him and knows that GOD has a purpose in everything he went through.

I really enjoyed this movie.",1465516800,,254,4.25

5928630,4,B00ENO3RXG,"I liked the movie. Of course, as it says, the the modern version of the story of Job, so as long as you understand that going into it then you'll be fine. It was touching...acting was OK. I just love what this story teaches about having faith in God and that's the main purpose why I got this. I'd like to share this with my friends...makes for a good movie night. :)",1463961600,,367,4.111111111111111
5928631,4,B00ENO3RXG,"It held true to the message of the biblical account of Joseph but was contemporary enough to attract a modern day audience. I found it to be a very moving reminder of how God takes what was intended for evil and redeems it for good. I felt it was as well written and acted as the Gods Not Dead movies. Although it was a lower budget film, it was well done and I would recommend it.",1462838400,,381,4.026315789473684

5928635,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Love this movie! Very clever on how they updated the story of Joseph, his brothers and situations. So it doesn't EXACTLY follow the Bible, but it fits with modern times and hits all the main points of the story. Great church movie.",1458950400,,231,4.523809523809524
5928636,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Unbelievable.  This was an incredibly rich movie, ripped right out of the pages of the Bible. The movie really is a modern-day Joseph.  An absolute MUST see for the entire family!  You will not be disappointed.",1458691200,,210,4.777777777777778

5928646,5,B00ENO3RXG,"I've always loved the joseph story in the Bible - that guy just kept serving God no matter where he found himself.  When I saw the advertisements for this movie, I didn't expect them to do such a great job of retelling that wonderful story.  It would stand alone even if you hadn't studied Joseph in Sunday School, but if you have, you will be even more impressed. I'm glad I paid to own it and not just rent it.  I will probably also buy the DVD so that I can loan it to my friends who need to see an encouraging story like this.",1452124800,,530,4.0285714285714285

5928651,5,B00ENO3RXG,"We need more movies like this that display the truth of the Gospel while not being so ""Christianese"" that unbelievers roll their eyes. Some of the reviews below make me sad...they're so set on whether or not ""it's in the Bible"" they're failing to see the real fruit of this! No, this movie isn't exactly to the point of what's the real Joseph story, but it's got the heart of the message, and delivers it without compromise. And I failed to mention...the acting is actually BELIEVABLE. God, help the industry come out with more BELIEVABLE acting for Christian films!!!",1447977600,,568,4.747474747474747

5928660,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Great movie, I was not disappointed. I love the biblical story of Joseph, it is one of my favorite  (Genesis 37:1-50:26). Season of Gray was very uplifting.  This is a movie based on a true story about Brady Gray, played by Andrew Cheney who lives on a farm with his brothers and father and just like the biblical story Brady is favored by his father and his brothers are jealous. No colorful coat involved though this time is was a very nice truck, boy have times changed. This is indeed a modern day story of Joseph and Brady is a very Godly man.  And he goes through some very trying times. Brady keeps his eyes and mind open to what God is trying to do. And that opens some pretty amazing doors for him. And as the famous biblical scripture says  You intended to harm me, but God intended it for good  Genesis 50:20",1443225600,,819,4.292207792207792

5928667,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Most movies are cheesey to me, but not this one.  It had a well written script and great actors to carry it out.  The main character, Brady, did a believeable job in conveying the emotions and mindset Joseph (from the bible) must have experienced, and the character Chris provided comic relief throughout the movie that was actually funny. I watched it with my whole family (not sure why it's PG-13 and not PG) and everyone was entertained.

5928748,3,B00ENO3RXG,"I liked the movie in itself, might even consider getting the DVD, but my problem is in comparing it to Joseph at all.  Sure, there had to be some modern differences with Brady, but TOO many to make the two stories relate well:
--too few brothers with unfamiliar names
--Brady bitter in prison (that could have originally happened to Joseph, though untold)
--Being encouraged in his faith by other prisoners (now that COULDN'T have occurred in the Biblical account)
--In the office, Brady does not exemplify leadership as the original Joseph must have for his position
--Family revelation/reunion was anticlimactic compared to Biblical Joseph.
It's a GREAT modern story of showing forgiveness because Christ first forgave us; but being 'originally hooked' by the ""Joseph concept"" made me expect so much more.  Except for that, I might have given 5 stars.",1417910400,13,853,5.085714285714285

5928837,5,B00ENO3RXG,Moved to tears. The way you can use a Bible story and then put it to film as you did with this....remarkable. I am always be astounded on God's wonderful ways of making a bad situation into something good. Joseph's story told like this would make it easier to understand the message God is telling and showing us.,1404950400,,313,4.413793103448276
5928838,5,B00ENO3RXG,"This Biblical adaptation of the story of Joseph was well done. It took place on a modern day ranch. There were brothers from previous marriages but the ""Joseph"" character was the only son of the mother that had died and his father loved him the most. The tension between the brothers and ""Joseph"" was predictable but, the rest of the adaption I really enjoyed because the main characters process of the many trials he goes through are believable! When his brothers beat him and pay someone to haul him off and drive him to a city and just leave him, our character meets people who really help to build our ""Joseph"" into the man of God he becomes at the end of the movie. It truly opened my eyes to the loving God we serve and the importance of forgiveness as well as God's amazing grace.",1404864000,,787,4.397260273972603

5928849,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Most Christian movies are either too preachy with bad acting and possibly confusing/misguided aims. This retelling of Joseph is well done, you get caught up in Brady's story on it's own but you never forget the story of Joseph. The dreams and visions and fulfillments of them are a little different but this is a different movie and what you tend to focus on more is Josephs story. He went through a lot to save a family that didn't want him, just like Jesus. He keeps getting convicted for sins He did not commit so he can save us. Joseph couldn't see it at the time, as followers of God we have to live a life of faith during trial and forgiveness.

Good movie with a good message.",1403308800,,683,4.3359375
5928850,5,B00ENO3RXG,Seasons of Gray is an awesome movie for young and old alike and shows how people should forgive and love one another no matter what.  I would recommend  this movie for anyone.,1403222400,,175,4.4375
5928851,3,B00ENO3RXG,"The biggest weakness of Christian films is that they tend to be preachy.  The other is the acting tends to be poor.  The main character is this film did a very good job.  The rest of the cast was mixed.  I especially felt like the character of his fellow co-worker who pick him up when hitchhiking was badly done.  I know he was supposed to provide comic relief, but felt that he had to play to a weak and negative stereotype.  The group hug at the end made me roll my eyes.  Can't we be any more creative than that?

Please, Christian filmmakers, stories don't have to preach to impart truths.",1403136000,5,594,4.288288288288288

5928853,5,B00ENO3RXG,I thought this movie was very well done. They did a great job of modernizing an important bible story. There are some valuable lessons in this story that are time eternal and well worth remembering. Romans 8:28 reminds us that God causes ALL things to work together for good to those that love the Lord. Not all things are pleasant and not all things are easy but ultimately God can bring about good even from trials and tribulation.

5928856,5,B00ENO3RXG,"I've seen a lot of Christian movies in my day. Yeah... so I've seen some really poorly written, acted and directed movies in my day.

This movie had a lot of decent acting! The lead actors did excellent if you ask me. There was a bit near the very end that wasn't quite acted well enough in my opinion, but the acting was good. The directing and casting was good.

The story that this is based on, Joseph, is a phenomenal story! It is probably my favorite narrative every. I think that the writer(s) of this film did an amazing job staying true to the heart of the original story. The dialogue was written really well, also. The comic relief was just enough and never over the top... maybe once, but I like to laugh.

It is the perfect example of forgiveness...much like the historical account of Jesus the Christ and his act of forgiveness, while taking away the sin of the world on the cross. Though I had never heard of most of the actors and actresses in the movie, they all handled their portrayals well. As the story unfolded, it held my interest. The end result, despite the ordeal, of false imprisonment, culminated the events which occurred throughout the film. The story includes love, hate, jealousy, deceit, compassion, honesty, dishonesty and...forgiveness.

Even though I as a woman really liked the movie, I think guys would like it even more, I guess judging by the reaction from my son and grandson.  I have one to keep and I bought one to give.

The quality and filming is well-done, and now that I'm rating this, I think I'll go watch it again.  I only gave it a four instead of a five because it wasn't so enthralling that I wanted to watch it again right away, but it certainly was worth buying.

A brother is betrayed by his older brothers out of jealousy---they beat him and then send him down the road.  His life takes one strange turn after another, leading him actually to the place where he needs to be.  Good acting, strong storyline.

The story sticks pretty closely to that of Joseph, as far as a modern retelling goes.

5928920,4,B00ENO3RXG,"What man intends for evil, God intends for good. This simple, yet powerful, message is all Brady Gray has left. His brothers, driven by jealousy, cast away their own flesh and blood in the same way Joseph was sold into slavery by his siblings.

Heartbroken and separated from his family, Brady holds tightly to his faith and begins to build a new life for himself. But there are more challenges in store for this servant of God.

False accusations land Brady in prison, where his God-given gift of interpreting dreams helps him forge friendships that will play an important role in his ultimate salvation. Upon his miraculous release from prison, Brady discovers, as his dreams predicted, that his brothers direly need his help. Despite the pain and suffering caused by his betrayal, Brady must find the strength to embrace one of the Bible's most important messages: We forgive because we are forgiven.

Seasons of Gray is a modern day retelling of the story of Joseph and his coat of many colors. This uplifting feature film is quality family entertainment with strong morals and an enduring message of hope.",1393804800,7,1110,4.8936170212765955

The story is a modernized version of the story of Jacob, Joseph and his brothers, struggles and triumphs.  Trust me, the movie isn't ""hokey"" and is suitable for all ages.  I have recommended it to several friends and all who watched it have really enjoyed the movie.  It stays loaned out all the time - so you can't borrow mine - buy your own!

In all honesty, I wouldn't have bought this movie without more recommendations under normal circumstances.  I bought it because my daughter is in the movie - just an extra; but with credits.  After watching it though, I was very impressed and that's the reason for this recommendation.",1393459200,,740,4.6461538461538465

5928927,5,B00ENO3RXG,"I REALLY enjoy watching films that leave me encouraged after seeing it, and Seasons of Gray did just that! It is a well made independent film (I also like to support the Indie Film makers), adapting the story of Joseph (Jacob's son) into a modern setting. I would say that while it does have some brief violence and some adult themes (think Potiphar's wife: nothing is shown though), this would be quite safe for the whole family. As with any film, though, if you are at all conservative in your what you let your children watch, I recommend previewing it first.",1392940800,,562,4.574257425742574
5928928,5,B00ENO3RXG,"Seasons of Gray is a modern re-telling of the story of Joseph in the Bible. We are introduced to Brady, who deals with his older brothers vicious jealousy on a constant basis. The fact that he is their fathers favorite son only fuels the fire, as does Bradys gift of being able to interpret dreams. When Brady receives a new truck for his birthday, his brothers decide theyve had enough and take matters into their own hands.

Their ruthless decision forever changes the course of Bradys life.

But does God still have a plan for Bradys life despite the horror of what is to come?

Later sentenced to prison based on the words of his bosss wife, who dishonestly accuses him of assault, Brady is faced with a decision. Does he turn his back on God, or grow in his faith?

Thats not the only major decision of which Brady faces. Hes also faced with yet another dilemma regarding his brothers.

Seasons of Gray has many great discussion points, including:

Gods plan for our lives, even when things go awry (Jeremiah 29:11);

Forgiveness (Matthew 6:14-15; Matthew 18:22);

Being a new creation in Christ (2 Corinthians 5:17); and,

What was intended for bad, God can use to accomplish His purposes (Genesis 50:20).

While Seasons of Gray is a family film with nothing objectionable, it does contain thematic elements appropriate only for those 13 and older. There is some violence, but it is tastefully done and not of the typical Hollywood variety. Regarding the scene with Bradys bosss wife, the issue of sexual assault is also discussed, although not explicitly shown.

Everything about Seasons of Gray is well done. The acting is top-notch, the plot engaging, the story line realistic, and the scenes vivid.

Some movies are downloads or rentals. And some movies are to purchase. Seasons of Gray falls into the latter category. With a clear presentation of the Gospel and must-watch bonus features, I highly recommend it as one of the best movies of 2014.

I have added this movie to my Mom-Approved movie listing on my wordpress blog.",1392768000,7,2036,4.799426934097421

5928932,5,B00ENO3RXG,"My wife and I were pleasantly surprised how fully this story of Joseph and his coat of many colors was transformed into a contemporary Texas setting. Cowboys, business conglomerates, jeans, highrise, and even a stock semi-trailer replacing the dessert camel caravan taking away the favorite son seemed natural in this film. Well done(a.k.a. Amen).

There may be reviewers of this film story depicting it as ""preachy."" When it happens the ""Seasons of Gray"" cast, crew, along with heaven's hosts, will leap for joy, as the intention was exactly that. To portray the story of Christ's forgiveness and life-giving power as told in the Bible about Joseph as well as the overall story of Jesus. The filming intent was to preach the Gospel, but in a modern contemporary setting. Uniquely interesting to even the Biblical scholar.

It is a well-known Bible story, filmed from a 21st century perspective, and worthy of a purchase. As a matter of fact, my guess, when Christians view this film work, they will be buying additional copies for witnessing.
I highly recommend buying at least 2. One for you to loan and share with family, the second to donate to your church library.",1391385600,38,1169,4.928934010152284
