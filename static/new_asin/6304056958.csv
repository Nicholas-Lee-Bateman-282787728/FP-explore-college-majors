787183,5,6304056958,"Start with a great cast-- Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell--and what else could you expect but a fabulous movie.  This movie kind of makes you glad you weren't rich back in the 1930's.  I  wonder how all those society matrons felt about this movie back then, as it  was a terribly unflattering portrayal of wealthy females. Norma Shearer  sometimes forgets that she's in the ""talkies"" and pantomimes  wildly, like the year was 1919 instead of 1939 (scene at the end where  Stephen comes back to her), but she's still very good in the role of Mary  Haines, the long-suffering wife of an unfaithful husband. George Cukor  really knew what he was doing as he guided this cast, and deserves kudos as  well.  This is an EXCELLENT movie.",929059200,2,763,4.792307692307692
787184,5,6304056958,"One of the greatest (and still most underrated) Hollywood comedies, about the lives, lies and tricks of few high-society ""friends"". Cukor is superb in its direction; he looks so comfortable directing only women,  that this is one of his ""gay-est"" films. Not even man appeared as  an extra, the women full the screen, with wonderful gowns, hilarious  dialogue and catty fights. Norma Shearer in her heartbreaking speciality;  she knows how to learn us the inmensity of the problem if Joan Crawford  steals your man. Joan Fontaine is lovely, and Paulette Goddard and,  specially, Rosalind Russell (our beloved Roz) are incredibly funny. Joan is  terrific as well as Crystal Allen; she's at her best, when she proclaims:  ""There's name for you, ladies, but it doesn't use in the high  society...outside of a kennel""",921196800,12,812,5.090909090909091

It has all the girl-power of the modern day, with all the class of the 1940's! It's a great film for a Girl's Night In! The most amazing thing about this movie to me is that it has an almost all female cast. You never see the men the women are discussing, loving, fighting for/about, & yet, their characters are just as involved & part of the story as the women you see throughout the film!

All of these women could have been my mother age-wise which gave me a perspective of being there when they left me home to go to the city.  I developed a much greater knowledge and appreciation of Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford who does glamor and ""claws"" very well.  She had a couple of terrific lines like ""minding one's own business"" and, of course, the kennel reference.  Rosalind Russell resounded as Sylvia Fowler and Paulette Goddard as Miriam Aarons.  I was sad to learn that ""Young Mary"" had her career cut short although she stands out wherever else I see her (I think it was with Ray Milland in the The Major and the Minor.  Marjorie Maine did her usual character job in her ""straight from the shoulder way.""  The all-girl cast made this film like a fine wine in writing an directing.

788169,5,6304056958,"And that's because they are the movies that should not be remade. While they may be dated in terms of the societal attitudes they depict, they also present themes that are so common to us all that they are not subject to the vagaries of fashion. This film comes close to fitting that description despite depicting the lives of women whose's lifestyles (spending all day at the spa, tea parties and dinners at fashionable (read grotesquely expensive) clubs, that most of us cannot relate to.  And yes, it depicts attitudes towards women that few of us would tolerate today, including references to it being acceptable to giving a woman the occasional smack, that women should expect and turn a blind eye to their husbands' infidelities while soldiering on, this film still manages to entertain with a near perfect script and performances by it's principal cast (Norma Shearer, Rosalind Russell, Joan Crawford, Joan Fontaine, Paulette Goddard) and it's supporting cast (Marjorie Main, Mary Boland, Phyllis Povah, Dennie Moore, Lucille Watson) that almost take us along on a journey through a reality we can easily recognize - if Norma Shearer's character wasn't so goody, goody and her relationship with her mother (Lucille Watson) so perfect (does anyone really have a relationship like that in this era of communication via text message?) And I think the film teaches us too, cautioning us to examine our relationships, to nurture the good ones and prune out the poisonous ones like mistletoe from a tree. All that, plus the terrific physical comedy of Rosalind Russell! What a hoot! Watch this 1939 version and then the 2008 ""remake"" and I think you'll agree.

788644,2,6304056958,"""The Women"" is a true classic, and has a lot going for it.  Great actresses, nice filming, fabulous art-deco sets, retro fashion, and many good one liners and moments.  Some fun little aspects: despite the large cast there does not appear to be a single male in the entire movie, and although it is black and white, smack dab in the middle of it is a 5 minute technicolor scene of a fashion show.  It's up to the viewer to decide whether it was part of a marketing campaign to get women to see the movie back then, or if it was some subtle artsy commentary on the nature of women.

Ultimately though all the fun gets overshadowed. I'm guessing I'll get ganged up on here, but let me state a couple things:  yes, I love old movies.  And yes, I love many old movies that are even in the same kind of genre/era.  It's not meant necessarily to be a screwball comedy like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It-Happened-One-Night-Blu-ray/dp/B00MRKX9PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It Happened One Night [Blu-ray</a>], but is still more similar than different in its reliance on snappy dialog, double meanings, and the like. Or great stuff like in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TCM-Greatest-Classic-Films-Collection-The-Thin-Man-Vol-1-The-Thin-Man-After-the-Thin-Man-Another-Thin-Man-Shadow-of-the-Thin-Man/dp/B005F265CU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TCM Greatest Classic Films Collection: The Thin Man Vol. 1 (The Thin Man / After the Thin Man / Another Thin Man / Shadow of the Thin Man)</a>.  If you like those types of films (I do), you know you have to expect certain types of farcial elements, stereotypes, and mindsets based on the times (""The Women"" is from 1939).  You just know some of that is a given and look past it.

What makes things different here, usually the off-putting elements are minor, tongue in cheek, or not the main driving force or purpose. ""The Women"" however, even if it is a light comedy, is delivered as if it is meant to have a moral to the story, and not a subtle one at that. They beat you over the head with it so much it just can't be ignored. Basically, women should expect to be cheated on, and be OK with it (and even welcome it as a small price to pay for home and hearth). There is even one line, said by a minor character and so very fast I don't think many catch it, but that women should even expect to be beaten a little here and there! Two lines that epitomize the whole movie, within the context of her husband cheating on her, go something like ""women are compromised from the day they are born"" (its the default state, so get used to it), and ""the loss of pride is a small price to pay for a woman in love"" (the loss of pride here being unconditionally staying in a bad relationship and allowing the mistress to bleed your bank account dry). Her mother laments the good old days when women were chattel, but ""at least they couldn't divorce and had to soldier on"".

The last 10 minutes are particularly entertaining, but still off-putting because (spoiler)the teary eyed ""happy ending"" is when she is able to ""win back"" the husband who cheated on her because she's able to expose how his new wife is cheating on him, somehow ""rescuing him"" in the process.

Without context, this may come across as just one old fuddy duddy who overreacts or doesn't understand the times. If anything its the opposite, and it takes a lot to not forgive these old classics (if there is anything to forgive them over in the first place).  This ones beats you over the head enough though that at least for me I couldn't help it. There are so many better older movies out there in this genre, you can skip this one entirely and not even think twice about it IMHO.

Bluray picture quality and audio are great.",1441238400,7,3807,4.909657320872274

Good acting, for the most part; snappy dialog; great sets and costumes. And it moves at a lightening pace. Even the slightly hokey conceit of only females being seen on screen -- even to the dogs in the opening sequence and the horses later on -- doesn't overwhelm what is basically a souffl.

And the tiny scene between the kennel lady and the dachshund at the beginning is one reason why I broke down and bought the DVD. Can't have too many dachshunds!",1440633600,,613,4.572727272727272

I saw The Women (1939) a couple of years ago and never bothered to review it until now. This movie was a smash hit and was the second highest grossing movie of 1939, behind only Gone With The Wind. It was directed by the highly respected George Cukor. It stars Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Joan Fontaine, and a whole bunch of other star actresses. It's a chick flick, but I wanted to see it anyway to see if it's as good as people describe. It is. It has my respect. It's funny, it's a lot of things rolled into one. I think the best acting came from Crawford, who played a bitchy kind of woman for a change, something she hadn't done much of up to that point in her career.

While I liked the movie, it's not a movie that I would buy due to the fact that it's too much of a chick flick. In fact, it doesn't rank in my Top 20 Crawford movies of all time, but it's a movie that has my respect.",1424044800,,1018,4.136363636363637

Great story line and the comedy is great! Seeing Joan Crawford as the vixen who steals the husband of her real life arch enemy Norma Shearer is fabulous!

The rivalry between Norma and Joan is legendary in Hollywood. Joan was jealous of Norma because Norma was married Irving Thalberg who was a studio executive at the time so Norma got choice roles and the best accommodations during filming.

So the tension you see throughout the movie between Joan and Norma is real!

Rosalind Russels performance is brilliant. One of the very few comical roles she played and she did an outstanding job. Such a natural comedian!

This movie has it all. Cat fights, fashion, back stabbing, women gossiping, vengance, comedy, romance and drama.

789239,5,6304056958,"It is hard to know what second and third wave feminists today would make of the film under review, George Cukors The Women. On the one hand this vehicle for a look at then, 1930s then, married life, haute bourgeois married life, in the first wave post-suffragette period has an all women cast made up of many of the up and coming leading women stars of the day. On the other, despite the comedic look at that life, the elephant in the room is the male of the species. All the conversation, or almost all of the conversation, revolves around getting a husband (serial husbands in some cases), keeping a husband, getting rid of a husband or, in the main case, getting a husband back. That narrow view of life, while not unusual for the time is hardly the stuff of liberation. I know I had mixed feelings about the film on that score and I am sure plenty of todays women would also.

The plotline is rather simplicity itself since the film runs on the comedic element mentioned above, runs on spoofs about womens gossip among themselves, about life and scandal at the beauty parlor, at the gym, at the ladies luncheons and the like. Runs ons as well about the various types of women, especially the catty, back-biting ones. One New York socialite (played by Norma Shearer) and part of the horsey set as well who had been living in a dream world finds out through much indirection, courtesy of a busy-body matron (played by Rosalind Russell) that her high-end Wall Street husband had been having an affair with a shop girl, somebody from the perfume counter at Macys or some such place (isnt that always the case in these things, that or a secretary, or for doctors a nurse, in any case usually some female slightly below the wifes class, but in any case younger and sympathetic, very sympathetic, to his plight that his wife no longer understands him), a conniving gold-digger shop girl (played by Joan Crawford) who winds up grabbing the guy, the husband, to the chagrin of our socialite who decides to soldier on with her daughter, her heart-broken daughter, despite her continuing love for her man.

If that is what he wants well then she, true heart, will not stand in the way. So she grants his wish for a divorce, although not in tough to get New York then but heads west for an easy Reno divorce (just like the better known, better publicized anyway, easy Reno marriage complete with replica chapel all for twenty-nine, ninety-nine or something like that) and takes their young daughter with her. In the aftermath of the divorce proceedings and once ensconced in to her upscale New York apartment digs our gold-digger shop girl shows her real colors by fooling around with another guy and before long our socialite is back in the fight to get hubby back. And succeeds in the melodramatic end.

Along the way in this one there are a lot of gags, some that seem anachronistic now like the goof gym sessions, the high-blown dress up charity balls and the like, but also a lot of ways that woman looked at marriage very differently then, seeing it as for keeps like it said in the wedding vows. We get their take on the institution from our stellar true-blue soldier on socialite, from a much married countess whose serial marriages don not blight her thrill at being married, married until the other shoe drops anyway, from a young married who got skittish about divorce, and from to a been around the block woman, a from hunger woman trying to keep a roof over her head just trying to break even in the love game. Of course, we also have the high-end easy meal ticket gals like our catty matron and that gold-digger shop girl to throw water on the whole idea of blessed marriage. But there it is, a slice of comedic marriage life from the first third of the 20th century.",1416960000,,3773,4.561946902654867

I totally fast-forward over the fashion show... watch it once to see the crazy haut culture of the time, but you get a taste in 2 mintues, and it goes on and on much longer.

When Mary Haines [Norma Shearer] is jilted by her husband, the claws come out, and Joan Crawford's pushy princess tries to snag her man.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: Based on Clare Boothe's hit Broadway play, The Women [1939] is about a group of bitchy, backbiting, Park Avenue Ladies Who Lunch...and dish...with disastrous results for the only one of them who's happily married. The entire cast, more than 130 speaking roles, is female. Appropriately, the screenplay credit went to two of Hollywood's women pioneers, Jane Murfin and Anita Loos. Jane Murfin had been writing ""women's pictures"" since the silent days, and she produced a faithful adaptation of Clare Boothe's play. Maybe too faithful. Shortly before production began, the censors objected to the racy dialogue. Enter Anita Loos, the petite dynamo who began writing silent films as a teenager, and who excelled at snappy dialogue. Loos claimed that she sat on the set and produced instant, cleaned-up variations of Boothe's innuendo-laden repartee.

""If only women ruled the world"" is an oft-repeated, plaintive feminine cry, but in George Cukor's uproarious adaptation of Clare Boothe's hit Broadway comedy, they do. As the trailer for 'The Women' blatantly states, ""There's not a man in sight,"" and that's no Hollywood hyperbole. Not a single male appears in this barb-filled send-up of pampered, self-absorbed Park Avenue matrons and the gold-digging social climbers who try to steal their husbands - not in human form, not in animal form, not in paintings or sculptures. It's all oestrogen all the time, as a cast of 135 actresses shanghai the screen for 133 minutes, trading verbal zingers, jockeying for supremacy, brandishing their exquisitely manicured claws, and using any means at their disposal to outwit, out-dress, out finagle, and even out-slug their dear, devoted sisters. Backstabbing and catfights have never been as much fun, and though this film may not paint the most flattering portrait of the fairer sex and it ridicules their foolishness and vacuity one moment and champions their wiles, strength, and chutzpah the next and it celebrates everything we love and hate about them. The film certainly doesn't please feminists, but 'The Women' doesn't profess to be anything other than a rollicking romp that relishes skewering the idle rich.

Males may not be seen in 'The Women,' but oh boy do they dominate the conversation, not only driving the plot, but also driving all the films devious, duped, delusional, and dithering dames to distraction. To hear her friends tell it, Mary Haines [Norma Shearer], a warm, loving, filthy rich socialite, lives in a ""fool's paradise"" in her swanky surroundings with her precocious daughter [Virginia Weidler], blissfully unaware that her seemingly devoted husband Stephen is two-timing her with Crystal Allen [Joan Crawford], a conniving perfume counter clerk at Black's Fifth Avenue who's more attracted to Stephen's bulging wallet than his ""Adonis figure."" Mary's blabbering best friend Sylvia [Rosalind Russell], who voraciously devours every morsel of gossip like a bite of succulent meat, and can barely conceal her abject jealousy over Mary's perfect life, arranges for Mary to learn of her husband's affair and conspires to destroy her marriage. Little does Sylvia know, however, her own husband is dallying with a feisty chorus girl [Paulette Goddard], while money issues threaten the union between doe-eyed newlywed Peggy Day [Joan Fontaine] and her stubbornly proud husband. Who stays married, who gets divorced, who receives their comeuppance, and who emerges unscathed, and unscarred. Forms the basis of this fast-paced story that features more baiting, sniping, and bickering per capita than any other movie in Hollywood history.

'The Women' revitalised Joan Crawford's career, which was on the skids following a string of unsuccessful pictures. Along with Katharine Hepburn, Fred Astaire, Marlene Dietrich, and several others, she was notoriously named ""box office poison"" by the Independent Film Journal the previous year. Joan Crawford took a risk by shucking her good-girl image and playing a bitch, and saying, ""I'd play Wallace Beery's grandmother if it was a good part,"" she famously said at the time, and the gamble paid off. Her spirited, hard-edged performance won raves, and despite limited screen time, she nearly walks off with the picture. Norma Shearer, one of Hollywood's most underrated actresses, is saddled with a far blander character, but she makes Mary real, lending her a flesh-and-blood depth that's not on the printed page, while Rosalind Russell is sublime as the vindictive, fast-talking Sylvia, arguably the film's most colourful and broad character. Paulette Goddard brings plenty of street-smart attitude and heart-of-gold warmth to her role, and Mary Boland is an absolute scream as the multiple-married, blithering Countess De Lave, who's always singing the praises of ""l'amour,"" despite its fleeting nature. Several other supporting performances merit mention, many of which add vital texture to the picture and engender plenty of laughs. Out of the 135 women who comprise the film's cast, there's not a dud in the bunch, with even the smallest parts making notable impressions.

The Women was remade as The Opposite Sex in 1956, but neither the addition of music nor the addition of men improved on the original. An updated 2008 version starring Meg Ryan and Annette Bening had feminist overtones. But most critics agreed that the later versions lacked the sparkle, bite, and star power that of the original The Women still have.

Blu-ray Video Quality  Warner Home Video takes great care of its vintage film collection, and this exceptional encoded 1080p image transfer supremely honours this 75-year-old classic and is a huge step up from the previous inferior NTSC DVD. The picture here is richer and more full-bodied, with deeper black levels and crisper whites. The DVD possesses a faded, washed out appearance, with lines that tend to be a tad fuzzy. The opening titles are crystal clear and gloriously vibrant, and once the narrative begins, the movie's natural grain structure is on glorious display, supplying essential texture and lending the image a marvellous film-like feel. A nicely varied grey scale helps promote a palpable sense of depth and punches up detail levels in background elements. Wallpaper patterns, various set decorations, and the designs adorning the actresses' gowns are all extremely well rendered, and close-ups highlight fine facial features well despite their slightly soft look, which was typical of the period. Bright, bold, beautifully saturated hues distinguish the Technicolor fashion show sequence, which also benefits from pitch-perfect contrast and exceptional clarity, and also outclasses the more wan-looking DVD. The scene is utterly superfluous, campy, and tedious beyond belief, but the gorgeous colour keeps the eye engaged. The DVD is littered with faint specks, but only a few errant marks crop up here, and no edge sharpening, noise reduction, or other digital doctoring could be detected. The Blu-ray transfer for 'The Women' isn't 100% perfect, but it's near on darn close to perfection you can get, and any fan of this excellent film will be thrilled with this terrific effort from Warner Home Video, and shouldn't hesitate to upgrade instantly.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  The 1.0 DTS-HD Master Audio track supplies well-modulated sound that perfectly balances the rapid-fire sniping and string-laden music score. I have seen 'The Women' many, many times, but during this most recent viewing I actually picked up a few lines of dialogue I had never heard before, that was not understood before. Though some of the quips get lost due to speedy delivery and 'The Women' rivals 'His Girl Friday' in the speech alacrity department, most of the conversations, bickering, and gossiping is clear and comprehendible. A wide dynamic scale keeps distortion at bay, even during the raucous catfight scene, and while the musical shadings fill the room with ease, they never overwhelm the on-screen action. Much of the track has been scrubbed free of any age-related imperfections, such as pops, crackles, and hiss, but some surface noise does remain, though it's only noticeable during the quietest moments. All in all, for a 75-year-old film, 'The Women' sounds pretty darn good and certainly outclasses the tracks contained on the previous inferior NTSC DVD.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature Vintage Documentary Subject: Another Romance of Celluloid: From the Ends of the Earth [1938] [10:00] This an episode of the entertaining M-G-M promotional series uses the subject of foreign importing as a flimsy excuse to advertise the studio's current and upcoming releases. Footage from 'The Women' is used to illustrate how imported perfume finds its way into M-G-M films, even though there's no perfume in the clip, while imported art objects help justify the inclusion of a scene from 'Ninotchka.' A parade of snippets from future attractions, including 'Babes in Arms,' 'Another Thin Man' and 'Balalaika,' concludes this black-and-white short.

Special Feature Vintage Documentary Subject: Hollywood: Style Center of the World [1940] [11:00] Jump ahead 2 years, and a new crop of M-G-M films is vigorously promoted in this equally entertaining instalment of the popular series. The hook here is how the glamorous costume designs seen in many M-G-M films influence Main Street fashion trends. May McAvoy, who starred opposite Al Jolson in 'The Jazz Singer,' can be glimpsed in a blink-and-you'll-miss-it role as a saleslady. Clips of Joan Crawford in 'Susan and God,' Vivien Leigh in 'Waterloo Bridge,' and Greer Garson in 'Pride and Prejudice' illustrate the point, and lead into the customary selection of teasers for coming studio attractions, including 'The Mortal Storm,' 'Boom Town,' and 'New Moon.' Interestingly, 'The Yearling' is hyped as a film for the coming year, but was soon shelved, and wouldn't be produced until six years later.

Special Feature Vintage Animated Short: One Mother's Family [1939] [9:00] This Rudolf Ising Technicolor cartoon chronicles A mother hen is taking her brood for a walk. They encounter obstacles along the way, such as traffic. There's a runt of the litter, who has more trouble with these than the rest. Momma stalks an inch-worm; she shushes the chicks; of course, the runt keeps bumping into things and making noise. And the biggest hazard of all is the hawk. But just when it looks like the hawk is going to get the runt, a run-in with a skunk saves him.

Special Feature: Alternate Black-and-White Fashion Show Sequence with Different Footage [6:00] Before M-G-M studio executives decided a splashy Technicolor fashion show sequence would add even more lustre to an already glossy picture, director George Cukor shot a similar scene in black-and-white. The main difference between the two, aside from a few different outfits and camera angles, is that in the monochrome version the models occasionally interact with the principals, which makes the fashion show feel like a more cohesive part of the film, instead of a lavish, disruptive interruption.

Special Feature: Scoring Session Music Cues [38:00] A whopping 22 audio only music cues, presented in superior fidelity without a hint of surface noise or other age-related defects, cover all the orchestral scoring in the film. It's quite a bounty and quite a boon for fans of vintage soundtracks.

Theatrical Trailers [1956] [7:00] You get to see the trailer for the original preview of 'The Women,' but also its Technicolor musical remake, 'The Opposite Sex,' which misguidedly added men into the film, are included. The trailer for 'The Women' virtually encapsulates the entire plot, which I suggest you do not watch it before you see the original The Women. This preview trailer of the remake, which stars June Allyson, Ann Sheridan, Joan Collins, who didn't yet seem to properly channel the bitchy siren she would later play to perfection on TV's 'Dynasty,' Dolores Gray, Ann Miller, Joan Blondell, Agnes Moorehead, and Charlotte Greenwood, focuses on the musical numbers.

Finally, forget the horrendous 2008 insulting remake, which was a crime against the Nation; George Cukor's 1939 version of 'The Women' remains an unqualified classic, as well as an absolute hoot! Incisively funny, bursting with timeless truths, and fuelled by a massive tank of oestrogen, this gossipy examination of feminine wiles, romantic couplings, and intense rivalries remains as fresh and deliciously nasty as it surely seemed upon its initial release 75 years ago. Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, and 132 other women contribute top-flight performances to this unforgettable romp that expertly mixes uproarious humour, heartfelt drama, and biting social commentary. Warner Home Video Blu-ray presentation significantly improves upon the inferior 2002 NTSC DVD, thanks to beautifully rendered video and audio transfers that infuse new life into this vintage motion picture and make an upgrade essential for fans. Supplements are strong, too, but it's the script and portrayals that turn this carefully orchestrated free-for-all into one of the all-time great comedies. No film collection worth its salt should be without it and that is why it is such an honour to add this brilliant all-time Hollywood Classic film to my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

789646,5,6304056958,"What a wonderful film year 1939 was.  And most forget about this classic tale of love, betrayal and bitchiness.  The first time I saw it was at a classic movie theater with ""All About Eve"" as the second film.  Two of the bitchiest movies of all time!  What I love most about this film is the fast-paced dialogue.  Rosalind Russell is very underrated in this film.  She, by far, has the best lines other than Paulette Goddard.

Two of my favorite actresses of all time, Joan Crawford (Crystal Allen) and Norma Shearer (Mary Haines) go head to head over Mary's husband Stephen Haines.  Crystal's cooing over Stephen on the phone at her work place is classic, ""do you beat that?  He almost stood me up for his wife!""  The dialogue from her co-workers are priceless.  (Interesting bit of trivia:  the woman who plays Princess Mara (the model) was married to actor Sidney Blackmer.  Her son, Jonathan is also an actor and was in the recent movie ""Lincoln"" with Daniel Day Lewis)  When Mary confronts Crystal in the dressing room, it's the perfect scene-especially when Crystal says, ""whenever I wear anything Stephen doesn't like, I take it off!""  As everyone knows, there are no men in this film, including the animals!  Some of the dialogue reveals very interesting social mores of the time; the wise mother who advises her daughter to not say a word about his affair.  Mary's response:  ""but this is today mother, not like when women were chattel.  We took each other for better or worse, and I won't qualify that relationship.  It's wrong, shockingly wrong!""  Some of the phrases are probably unfamiliar now-""he was an absolute Borgia!""  ""the beezle!""  There are only two performances that strike me as strange-the daughter little Mary (Virginia Weidler), who has a somewhat affected speaking style and a very dramatic way of acting and the character of Peggy (Joan Fontaine) who goes a little overboard playing a ditsy wife who decides to leave her husband over an argument about how to spend her money.  She decides to go back ""and do everything Johnny says"" after finding out she's going to have a baby.  But the biggest transformation from the beginning to the end is Norma Shearer's Mary Haines.  She's somewhat naive and timid at the beginning, but by the end, she's definitely grown claws, jungle red!  By all means, DO NOT waste your time with the Meg Ryan remake.  So awful.",1400025600,,2382,4.7579462102689485
789647,5,6304056958,"Warner's Home Video continues it's excellent track record of restoring some of the classic films from Hollywood's Golden Age with an excellent video and audio Blu-ray of the 1939 classic ""The Women"" for it's 75th Anniversary. As they've proven with their recent Blu-ray upgrades of such B&W classics as ""Mrs. Miniver""(1942) or Technicolor gems like ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""Gone with the Wind""(both from 1939), they offer both fans and collectors the very best video presentations when it comes to their vast film library which includes all the MGM films. With the release last week of ""The Women"" on Blu-ray, Warner's has outdone itself with this fast paced and still funny film comedy that's even more enjoyable now on Blu-ray. It's a vast improvement over the 2002 standard DVD right from the opening credits(Bitrate: 22.95). Gone are the scratches, dirt, vertical lines, and fuzzy scenes that plagued previous versions and what we get instead is a nearly flawless video that really brings out things that went missing in the standard DVD(costumes, props & set designs, etc.) There are still some problems with certain scenes that appear softer than others but this may be due with the film elements used more than anything else. For the most part, the print used for this Blu-ray is in exceptional condition and may even have been restored. So has the audio(no more hiss or other noise artifacts). This is very apparent about halfway through the film when the picture suddenly changes to a ten minute Technicolor fashion show whose only purpose I can fathom was to show off the costumes of designer Adrian but the inclusion of which slows down the picture(George Cukor, the director wanted it removed to no avail). Of course, it could have been added to give audiences watching the film time to catch their breath that's how good the screenplay is(by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin). The story, based on the popular play by Clare Booth Luce, is about the pampered, rich, gossipy(and ultimately bored) lives of some of Manhattan's high society women who will stop at nothing to get what they want(usually for themselves) even if they have to destroy one another in the process. It may have been hard for Depression Era audiences to identify with such women but under George Cukor's expert direction the whole story holds your interest due in no small part to the outstanding cast(no men, only women). Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard and Mary Boland are all superb in their respective roles. The supporting cast is excellent too, with Lucille Watson, Marjorie Main, and little Virginia Weidler stealing all the scenes they appear in. But it's Norma Shearer who holds the film together with her outstanding and heartfelt performance as Mary Haines whose ""perfect"" life is torn apart by gossip and betrayal. An underrated actress, Shearer is a revelation and her performance should have been nominated for an Oscar that year, but was inexplicitly ignored(so was the film) in a tough year. Thanks to Warner's, a lot of her films have been released recently on DVD and viewers finally have the chance to see what an exceptional actress she was. ""The Women"" is 133 minutes with the Color Sequence(Aspect Ratio: 1.37:1) and contains the following subtitles: English SDH, French and Spanish. Audio includes: English DTS-HD Master Audio and Spanish Dolby Digital 1.0. Special features include two documentaries and the alternate B&W fashion show sequence with different footage (involving the actresses) that Cukor filmed in addition to the Technicolor sequence. Also included are the original Theatrical trailers for ""The Women"" and the color musical re-make ""The Opposite Sex""(1956). (Please note: This Blu-ray disc is housed in an eco-cutout case so you may want to change to a more solid HD case for added protection). ""The Women"" may have been overshadowed by other MGM blockbusters in 1939 such as ""Gone with the Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz"", but it still packs a punch after 75 years with this new Blu-ray presentation from Warner Home Video. It comes highly recommended.",1399939200,10,4085,5.035450516986706
789648,5,6304056958,"Happy to report Blu-ray looks gorgeousall the shimmery black & white beauty you could ask for.  Few sequences are grainier than others, but overall image is clean and rock solid (no more weird ""video noise"" around the text in the opening credits), and as with most Blu-rays you find yourself picking up on all sorts of trivial details you weren't able to see before: Joan Crawford's freckles, the art deco wallpaper in the ladies lounge at the end, the less-than-stellar faux finishing on some of the sets, etc.  Technicolor sequence is also a beauty.  As I hoped for...Joan's insane ""glitter dress"" in the final showdown leaps off the screen (I remember seeing this projected in 35mm back in the 80s, and the audience literally gasping when she comes busting into the room in that get-up).

Should you upgrade?  Yes!  The original DVD looked fine to my eyes, but this is obviously remastered for the 75th anniversary and the bigger your TV screen the more you'll notice the improvements.  As I've mentioned in reviews of other successful B/W Blu-raysthe upgrade achieves that long-lost ""silvery grain"" image you used to only get in the theater with 35mm.  If you don't care about that or know what it means...you can probably stick with your DVD.

The supplements are the same except for the addition of a cartoon and an audio-only sound cue session (the audio is very robust and clear).  Would like to have seen Criterion-level supplements for this filmbut Warners has pretty much discontinued that practice with their classic films.

Add to that the trials and tribulations of the all good all the time, Mary, who believes that her husband will eventually tire of the jaded mistress that stole him away from her, and those so-called friends of hers that seem to change friendships as the situation moves along.  Current soap operas have nothing on this storyline. It's definitely a ""chick flick"", because there are absolutely no men in this movie...even though they are the subject throughout.

789881,5,6304056958,"The Women, as shown by many reviews here, seems to spotlight the supporting cast as much as the heroine Mary Haines (Norma Shearer); however, the story itself is about Mary and her ideas, ideals, her and relationship with her husband.  Mary's problem is her husband has been ""snagged"" by a good looking and clever shopgirl who is playing around with her husband behind her back (Joan Crawford).  As Mary is good the shopgirl is evil and has her sights on the money and not the man.  But that isn't the key to Mary's problems - her friends seem to be.  These friends are an element of the story that is often concentrated on by viewers and reviewers, but they are really not the key to the story.  Mary is the key element that drives and controls the events.  It is her ideals that men have no right to stray from the promises of marriage (no one has in Mary's mind) that thrusts the story forward.  If he (the husband) isn't honest and trustworthy what good is it being married to him?

The Women actually revolves around that idea.  Is marriage worth having if a partner isn't going to be faithful?  Then comes a very complex answer.  Maybe the man, or anyone, can stumble and still be worth having.  IF he doesn't love the girl he has dallied with, and IF the wife is truly his one love, and IF he isn't going to wander again, IF the children love him, IF he will love and respect the needs of the children, et al,  THEN he might be worth keeping.  This answer comes in part from the mother of Mary Haines who has suffered some setbacks herself.  Mary's child is an additional complication.  As Mary struggles with this question - is a marriage worth saving once a  partner has slept with another - among varying answers from her friends, she almost turns into a female Job with her friends doing her a lot more harm than good most of the time.

After a good deal of suffering Mary reaches her conclusion about her particular husband.  Meanwhile, many of her advice giving friends are blind sided by divorce and unfaithful partners themselves.  At the end of the movie, just like an MGM movie always delivers, the good prosper and the evil suffer.  But the gut busting comedy covers up a truth that the playwright Luce brings out throughout the script, is sex the foundation of marriage?  With women around that can and will seduce a man in an instant - men being infinitely susceptible in this arena according to Luce - do the evil win the man and the battle of marriage?  Is the time spent at the spa to stay in shape really what marriage is all about?  Stay in shape and keep your man?  One woman who is terribly out of shape and pops kids every year seems to have the best marriage of all.  But that marriage takes a back seat to the marriages of the other women.  She is an afterthought in the play, a kind of comic interlude.  Or is she?  Remember, Mary isn't as good looking as her competitor and unlike the others she has a child.  So... does the kid popping friend have a joke of a marriage or the perfect marriage?  She is the point of many a joke from the others, but maybe the joke is on the good looking friends who gossip their way to nothingness while buying expensive fashions and exercising to maintain their stunning figures.

Mary, through the incredible acting of Norma Shearer, manages to fight through the false idea that marriage is sex and beauty, and through the idea that marriage must be perfect.  Luce actually poses a straightforward set of questions with extremely complex answers set in a comedy theme.  This isn't a movie or a play about feminism.  Anyone ""seeing"" this in Luce's play is looking for political correctness in the wrong place.  Luce is going much deeper than feminism here.  She is digging to the heart of the matter of marriage and the eternal commitment of men to women and the problems that that particular idea brings.  It is also, most decidedly, NOT a period piece.  Saying this is a period piece is deeply demeaning to the clarity Luce presented in exploring lasting questions of human relationships.  Greek tragedies are not period pieces and neither is The Women.

You can watch the movie for comedy alone and come away quite satisfied; however, if you want to exercise your brain and really watch the story and the people you will be blasted by the truth Luce seeks and the complex answers she comes away with.

789932,5,6304056958,"This is a very good, very clever, bitter sweet ""romantic comedy"", made in 1939, a time when neither romantic comedies nor the political correctness existed. Below some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

As you probably already know, this film is COMPLETELY devoided of men! Not even one man appears on the screen - EVER! Even cats and dogs which appear in this film are all females! And at 2 hours 13 minutes this is a long film... And yet, even if they are so conspicuosly absent, men are nevertheless extremely present...)))

The scenario of this film is an adaptation of a play and it is clearly visible - and this is one of the strongest points of this film, as it makes it completely focused on witty, clever, fast, brilliant and sometimes pretty cruel dialogs. Once again, this is a long film - but believe me, you will not see the time pass! All actresses perform at the top of their abilities and they are a pleasure to watch.

But the greatest treasure of this film is the absolute lack of political correctness (and it begins with the opening titles)! If anybody tried to make this film today, with the same dialogs and solutions, well, I think the feminist/politically correct crowd would probably lynch him/her and throw what is left to piranhas! And this is a MAJOR reason to buy, watch and keep this film.

Joan Crawford is a particular delight in this film, playing (what a surprise) an evil, dark hearted gold digger - but still, I appreciated very much that at the end she had the final word - well, kind of...))) Believe me, it is worthy to watch this long film to the very end even if you have to retain just the scene in which Joan Crawford has the final word...)))!

Amongst the treasures of this film are also a heavy drinking scene, a wonderful catfight (honestly, even better than any of Krystle vs. Alexis scenes in ""Dynasty""), lots of wonderful gossiping scenes and many, many others.

This film is also a terrible indictement against the divorce, reminding us of the heavy price always paid by the principal victims - the children...

Bottom line, I loved this film, I am so happy that I bought and watched it and I will keep it preciously for future viewings. Enjoy!",1366675200,2,2212,4.584810126582278

789973,5,6304056958,"When Clark Gable asked that his Director George Cukor be replaced on Gone With The Wind - he did him a great favour. About a week or so later Cukor began shooting the 'The Women'  and with his deft touch was able get the best from his strong all-woman cast.  Norma Shearer - a great favourite of mine - is spot on with her portrayal of Mary  Haines, whose husband has an ill advised affair  with the grasping opportunist Chrystal. Shearer plays Mary with humour and dignity, a role that in the hands of another actress could well have been melodramatic,even maudlin.
Joan Crawford was the biggest star (female) at MGM for a long time - mainly because she was the working class role model for so many members of the audiences that flocked to see her, in the thirties and forties. Chrystal is more of a villain than even Miss Crawford usually played, but she plays her with her usual Crawford bluntness and toughness, and brings out the characters deception and plain old rat cunning, very well.
Rosalind Russell was a witty, intelligent actress who developed into a wonderful character actress, as seen in The Majority Of One (with Alec Guinness), the musical Gypsy, Picnic (with Bill Holden) and the Citadel (with Robert Donat).
But, when playing a quick thinking, fast talking , comedic role Miss Russell really came into her own. I couldn't imagine anyone else being able to match it with Cary Grant in His Girl Friday as Rosalind Russell did.
In 'The Women'  Miss Russell's flair for comedy is infectious and her performance is another very good one.
Paulette Goddard (was her career in decline when this was made ? Her role is not a major one in 'The Women') gave her usual solid effort. Marjorie Main and Lucille Watson both added humour (Main) and wisdom (Watson)  and were good contributors, as was Mary Boland  (ah l'armour,l'armour)  who reprised her Broadway role for this film.  The only ""silly"" characterisation was left to Joan Fontaine - were women ever as naive as she ?
Amazingly, 'The Women"" stands up well today - and I think that says a lot about the cast and more importantly the Director, Mr Cukor.  When one realises this was the man who directed so many of those wonderful Hepburn/Tracy films, we can appreciate that whilst GWTW may not have been his forte - well scripted comedies such as ' The Women', certainly were.",1354579200,,2342,4.67639902676399

789976,5,6304056958,"The lead wife (Mary) is a good woman married to a really good guy (Steve). A little before the 10 year anniversary mark, the marriage undergoes a challenge from an outside predator, directed at the husband. Unfortunately, our good little woman, through bad advice and some hurt pride, passively allows him to slide away from her. The general premise is that he will miss her and come back. But, it develops into a hostile takeover. Now, she gets to live with the results of all this conventional wisdom. Through process and circumstance, she eventually comes awake, gets fired up and finally gets in the ring.

The general wrench of the story is watching (not literally of course - no men) a perfectly intelligent man so easily played upon by such a shallow subject. Since his wife has run off on a little getaway on the strength of some of that poor advice and the pride, the field is left wide open. But, it works its way to a happy ending that allows you to unwind. And, it is written so as to give you some thrills along the way as comeuppance comes to call on the conniving antagonists. A TCM announcer said the classic cat fight of all times was in this movie. It will definitely engage your attention. But it doesn't start at the ranch -- it runs all the way through!

So much has been noted about this now classic women's picture, but wanted to comment on something about the Joan Crawford character seen in a lot of the films from this period. She works at a sales counter, yet has a nice place of her own and great clothes. She played a lot of shop girls, always having a knockout wardrobe, including over the top evening clothes and a very well appointed apartment. In the real world, a sales girl would have to be living at home or at the Y or have at least one roommate, and wouldn't be able to afford an expensive wardrobe. But, this all goes with the movies from that period, which, regardless, will always have a special place for many.

Also, really enjoyed Virginia Grey's part as the savvy sales girl who prickles Crystal while she's on the phone with Steven. ""Holy mackerel, what a line!"" With so much cleverness going on, that sequence doesn't get much mention, but found it very funny.  How about that beauty clinic! What a setup.  And we do love to admire the clothes, which were so fabulous then with their dressing up so much. There's a lot to check out in this picture, as well as catching the snappy lines, as has been mentioned here.  You literally cannot catch most of it when the gang is all together.

790001,3,6304056958,"I never ever warmed up to the untalented Norma Shearer.  Her directors throughout her career let her rely CONSTANTLY on her silent film faces.  Her facial expressions in ""The Women"" are no exception.  The quick hand to the mouth and the popping eyes (she's surprised, you know).

She's untalented.  Always.  She just landed in big budget pictures with the sets and the wardrobes and really, you forget that there's a man, a leading man, in most of her films.  It's NORMA SHEARER after all.

No men appear in this film.  Fine.  Good.  The movie starts out horrifically noisy in a beauty parlor. It seems as though there are two hundred women babbling all at once.  This opening scene is NOT entertaining.  So much noise, in fact, that you want to turn the movie off.  And it seems to last and last.

And here's Rosalind Russell in stupid hats and odd sweaters.  (What's up with the sweater with the eyeballs on it?)  She does have some good lines and delivers them well, though.  I'll give her that.

Joan Crawford comes in for her share of the pie as the ""other woman"".  She's the best in the cast and it clearly spotlights how MGM sort of tossed her off in a batch of witless films throughout the thirties.  Maybe they didn't know what they had in her.

We get the weepy, boring Joan Fontaine and the supposedly wise Paultette Goddard and the damn-it-to-hell Mary Boland who never lets anything get her down.  We also get a screeching Marjorie Main, who would go on to better things than this carp-fest.

The worst of the lot is Virginia Weidler playing Norma's daughter.  So saccharine is her performance it is apt to give you a toothache. (""Daddy....Daddy darling....""  Who the hell, ever, said ""Daddy Darling??????""  Her performance is gross.

And then there's NORMA SHEARER.  All gowned and coiffed and troubled and wronged.  Her silent movie face making the best of her waning stardom.  She can't act.  Never could.  And this movie is proof of that.  She's just there.  The central character, yes, but all the other woomen seem to have much more fun living.  Not our Norma.  She's the good and dutiful wife.  (Imagine someone requesting from the cook, ""Tonight we'll have Pancakes Barbara""  Oh, wait, you don't have to imagine it: it's here!!!)  What the hell are ""Pancakes Barbara"" anyway????

The dialouge is fast, funny and VERY entertaining.  Some of it is silly, but by and large is a very well written movie.  With the exception of the noisy noisy beginning and - hold on to your hats, folks - a Technicolor fashion show that plops down out of nowhere and is not only unnecessary, but brings the film to a screeching halt as you watch these models with their bizarre get ups, most of which would be better suited to the characters that populate Oz.  An odd moment, indeed.

For most of the cast, their association with this film was a step in the right direction for their own careers.  For Norma Shearer, it's a vanity production all the way.",1335830400,3,2955,4.628626692456479
790002,5,6304056958,"Why tinker with a masterpiece? This original movie version of the stage play was remade twice for the screen and once for television and all of them are not just poor remakes, they are AWEFUL in comparison. The 1950's musical remake, ""The Opposite Sex"" fails in many ways. First, by turning it into a musical. Second, by casting June Allison in the lead. And third, by adding men to the cast. The latest remake from a few years ago fails by trying to modernize the storyline. The story works best when set in the 1930's pre-""women's lib"". This 1939 version is much more biting and satiracal, the actresses give their all for director George Cukor. As superb as Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer and Rosiland Russell are, for me, the stand-out performances were by the three older actresses, Mary Boland, Marjorie Main, and especially Lucile Watson.",1334966400,3,843,4.820689655172414

Maybe this is an urban legend, but the fact is that the film is a superb comedy with a great cast. Rosalind Russell as Sylvia is the funniest and the best, but Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Mary Boland, Paulette Goddard ad a very young Joan Fontaine are all very good. Of course, it`s a play with lots of dialogue, but the famous MGM glamour in sets, costumes (with a fashion show in Technicolor!) and 'more stars that there are in Heaven', under the direction of a master like Cukor, is really something worth while.

The lovely and sweet Mary Haines discovers that her beloved husband, Steven is cheating on her. Back in 1939, women of her social standing didn't have careers other than supervising their households (doesn't hurt if you also have a maid and a cook as Mary did - and thank goodness since her household staff fill us in on all the gossip).  Days were filled with beauty salons, fashion shows and exercising (which consisted of a vibrating belt doing all the work for you as you gossiped with your friends).  Of course gossip is always fun to hear except when you find out you are the subject as Mary discovers when her dimwitted manicurist drops a bombshell on her.

The other woman, Crystal, a sleazy and sexy shopgirl who sells perfume is played to conniving perfection by Joan Crawford.  Does Mary overlook the indiscretion or confront her husband?  While it is very funny, it also gives us a glimpse of how limited women were back at this time and while someone like Mary who had wealth could still ""live"" without being married, it reminds us of those other women who had to deal with the same issues but had to stay tied to their men simply because they couldn't survive financially on their own.  While this movie is dated, it still remains surprisingly fresh with wicked and sharp dialogue that doesn't seem to end.

790008,5,6304056958,"Not one man in this movie, but who cares. This is a terrific movie made in 1939, which is typically considered the year that generated more great films than any other. Adapted from the play by Clare Booth Luce, it tells the story of the happily married Mary Haines (played by Norma Shearer) who discovers that her husband Stephen is philandering with a tart  shopgirl named Crystal (played by Joan Crawford) in the cruelest of ways. When it comes to a showdown with Stephen, Crystal wins out and off Mary goes to Reno to get a divorce. In Reno, Mary encounters a wide range of would-be divorcees at the dude ranch where she is residing for six weeks. Hilarity reigns supreme as the diverse women interact with one another while telling their tales. The actresses range from hottie showgirl Paulette Goddard to dowager rich woman Mary Boland to Mary's disconnected friend Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Rusell). At the ranch the comedy ranges from ribald to physical and the comedic timing is perfection. Back to NYC and reality, Mary carries a torch for Stephen who is remarried (and miserable) to Crystal who is diddling on the side with a yodling cowboy named Buck Winston. All this culminates with a public cat fight which adds to the general mayhem.
This is absolutely one of my favorite comedies from any year. The large cast of women perform well in tandem with one another. Their characters are well-defined and the dialogue is snappy and oh-so-funny. The script doesn't drag or drone on endlessly. While the staging was done in 1939 style, it is barely noticable once you get into the story. The female ensemble cast plays off one another beautifully and while the meatiest parts are played by Shearer and Crawford, all the actresses manage to shine brightly and own their roles.",1312156800,2,1780,4.798045602605863

The writing is excellent, the actresses beyond great. It's humorous and makes its point well, too. You can sympathize with Norma Shearer, laugh at Mary Boland, and hate Joan Crawford. The first time I saw it on TCM I didn't expect much, but was very pleasantly surprised!

The plot centers around Mary Haines (Shearer), who discovers her husband has been seeing a sales clerk from a local department store. There are various very entertaining sub-plots as well. You see how the lives of some of the NYC wealthy elite weave together, and how all the women deal with their problems.

Oh- and I bought this at the request of my 15 and 17 year old daughters! They love it, too, and so went to the theater to see the remake. They came home disgusted at what they felt was gratuitous profanity, drug use and near nudity, but more than anything because the new movie first makes Mary culpable for her husband's cheating and then a negligent mother. It's quite out of keeping with the original. I think the lesson is, when you have actresses like those in the 1939 production, writing by Claire Booth Luce, and George Cukor directing...don't mess with it.

790046,5,6304056958,"Looking at the IMDB page for this film baffles me a little.  How in the world did this film receive no awards recognition in 1939?  I mean, yes that year was a great year for film (or so we are told almost every time prestige in film is broached) but to be honest, `The Women' is one of the best films of that year; easily.  It is witty, catty, charming and wholly entertaining.  It sports a brilliant cast with rich performances and poignant emotional material.  Why in the world did this film get ignored by any and all awards bodies?

Oh yeah, the film is about women.

Critical prejudice against women is disturbing in film.  Even today, it is hard to get a film funded or released or recognized if it is female driven.  With a few exceptions (like that Sarah Jessica Parker phenomenon) film is generally male centric, and nearly every baity and or congratulated film (which usually results in heaps of accolades) stars a strong male lead.  I'm not saying that it DOESN'T happen, I'm just saying that history has proven it is very difficult for a film that centers around women to garner deserved respect.

So, with my little rant out of the way I'll commence with my review of this 1939 near-masterpiece.

I want to be clear that I have not seen the Meg Ryan remake, although I am not apposed to it.  The reviews were savage when it came to that film, and so I stayed away, but I can't say that I wasn't at least a tad bit intrigued.  Now that I have seen and digested the original I'm a tad interested to see how the remake made out with their `spin' on the concept, although I will admit that my expectations are FAR from high.

The film centers on a group of socialites as they gossip about one another religiously, digging into the secret affairs of their so-called friends as a way to validate their own unhappiness.  When Mary, the groups sole `kind heart', finds herself at the center of a scandal involving her husband and a department store perfume girl, everything goes up in arms.  Mary is furious (as she has every right to be) but she is calmed by her mother who insists that she let the matter go.  Her friends on the other hand want her to make something of it, telling off the `girlfriend' and leaving her husband.  Soon pride takes over and Mary makes decisions in rage, not out of the comfort of a clean state of mind.

Can she find happiness after the wake of divorce?

Instead of playing coy, the film really tackles the weight of adultery with a sharp tongue.  Some may balk at the ending or state that it plays up the man's affairs too lightly, but I think there is much to be said about circumstance and forgiveness here.  Having been through a similar situation in my own home life, I can sympathize with the decisions and emotions felt by Mary, and I actually appreciate the films way of allowing her to vent but them `come to her senses' in a way.

The film is sharply written and directed to develop its characters with multiple layers, giving the audience ample reasons to love and hate them.  We see their faults as well as their soft spots, and we begin to understand their motives and their actions, even the seemingly heartless characters.  This was a hard task to pull off, but `The Women' does so remarkably.  What is also so wonderful about this film is that the dialog is so fresh and brilliantly delivered.  It stands on par with many of the films released today in that department.  This is a great testament to the films actresses, all of whom turn in wonderful work.  Every last supporting player pulls her weight, standouts being Lucile Watson, Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard, and Rosalind Russell is simply devilish as the `so called best friend' Sylvia.  But this film is all about two women for me, Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford.  Shearer is just simply breathtaking as the betrayed Mary.  The fear and torment is brilliantly constructed all over her face.  While I loved her character arc in the end, I didn't find her mischievous center as convincing as her tortured one, but I still loved her.  Crawford is genius here.  She is deliciously evil, not a sour note in her star turn.  I am not the biggest Joan Crawford fan either.  I find her (normally) largely overrated, but this is a spectacular turn from her.

Chew it up and spit it out.

In the end, this is a brilliant film.  I am totally in love with it, and guess what; there is not a single MAN in this film...not one!",1279497600,2,4431,4.461442786069652

790048,5,6304056958,"Let's see if you can identify this property:  a gaggle of upscale, high maintenance women, mostly married to men with deep pockets.

They lunch, they shop, they attend fashion shows, they dish. They form brief, musical chairs type alliances within the group.  They diss each other and often the husbands as well.

They discuss their respective issues and sometimes appear supportive of each other, often disingenuously.  One relies on her sage like mother for advice  They go to spas to be pampered and pummeled.  They work out to stay fit and desirable.  They wear cutting edge a la mode everything.

Simply watching them rail and flail within their small milieu is ensorcelling verging on addictive.

And, did I mentioned among them there is a from the wrong side of the tracks unscrupulous wannabe?

Name the property.

Did you guess the Real Housewives of Hither and Yon?  New York?  New Jersey?

Well, no wonder.  The work in question, though fiction,  might well have been produced last week and a part of that franchise!

Meaning,  comments about the work being stale, outdated,
even anachronistic....if you see what is there, must be coming from critics lacking discernment and perspective.

Thing is, this work was produced SEVENTY years ago.

The property is The Women.  The original (the only one worth seeing), written by the Moxie-endowed, razor keen Claire Booth Luce and directed by one of the finest women's' directors who ever set foot on a set, George Cukor.  And that, according to every actress he ever directed.

Ah, the halcyon days of MGM, and in a year considered to this day,  marked by an almost embarrassing  excess of brilliant movies: 1939.  It's still  considered Hollywood's Greatest Year.

The Women is populated by an all star, all female cast whose ages span several decades.

Each luminary delivers an unforgettable performance, most notably,  the deliciously manic Rosalind Russell
at her rat-a-tat finest.

Costumes by Adrian...you bet, late 30s a la mode, and get that fashion changes and that is usually driven by commerce.  So, make sure your vision is not stuck in Prada & D & G.  Aspiring to be au courant has no circa, after all.

When I first saw this film on TV way back, I thought the premise that women ought be blindly devoted to their men was the fly in the cinematic ointment rendering this movie pre Feminist archaic.

I was wrong. Incredibly, not a lot has changed, as per what we see via the reality shows in question.

Norma Shearer plays the initially stoic lead opposite her nemesis, Joan Crawford, who, using faux sexuality, is out to steal Ms. Shearer's husband for his money.  These two were actual rivals at MGM back in the day.  Ms. Crawford,
who, in this film plays herself, addressing why Ms. Shearer's light eclipsed her own stardom at Metro, hurled,
""Well, she sleeps with the boss.""

Indeed.  Ms. Shearer married the creatively brilliant, but physically fragile Irving Thalberg.  They had two kids together before he died far too young.

The characters depicted in The Women are no more caricatures than those individuals we see in The Real Housewives franchise.

If you are lucky enough to buy this movie, you will be taken aback by its timelessness if you work to see things in perspective.

Not to mention, you will be captivated and entertained...and perhaps even moved to ponder social mores and gender roles---and even if monogamy is indigenous to our species (we are not beavers, after all)---by some of the best who ever were.",1273968000,2,3500,4.877551020408164
790049,5,6304056958,"George Cukor directed this wicked tale about a bunch of high society women in New York City who intermingle with each other. Starring a who's who of some of the best actresses in Hollywood in the 1930's, ""The Women"" starred Norma Shearer, Rosalind Russell, and Joan Crawford, with Joan stealing the movie from her co-stars. Although not the biggest part in the film, Crawford, desperate for a meaty role after playing shop girls for over ten years, agreed to the part saying she would play Wallace Barry's grandmother if it were well written. Crawford's depiction of Crystal, the man-stealing husband with claws of an alley cat, is her first depiction of bitchy roles that she would become famous for. The movie is known for having no male acting parts and according to some even the animals were female. 1939, the year in which ""The Women"" was made, was one of the best years Hollywood had with ""Gone With The Wind"" and ""The Wizard of Oz""  playing in theatres. In 2009 a remake of ""The Women"" was made with Meg Ryan, but is simply best forgotten.

Joan Crawford is very good as Crystal and Norma Shearer and the rest of the all-female cast distinguish themselves, but the film is far too long (the pace slows down to a crawl when the narrative leaves New York City) and has too little plot to keep a viewer's interest for all 130 minutes; I enjoyed aspects of The Women, but can only give it a lukewarm recommendation.

790073,5,6304056958,"Great film about woman's gossip and what harm it can do, and how you can tell your true friends.  ""The Opposite Sex"" is a remake of this film and is equally good.",1264809600,,162,4.0625
790074,2,6304056958,"I remember looking forward to seeing this movie.  It boasts an all-female cast, (was it in this version, or in the newer one, that there WERE some males in bit parts?), and was called ""THE WOMEN"", so it would, I hoped, give breath and life to what women really want and think about. Which -- in my opinion at least --are mostly the very same things men want and think about: food, clothing, shelter, love, achievement, advancement, success in financial and personal realms, the fulfilment of talents, and the enjoyment of being with friends and relatives.....just to name a few.

Well, I suppose I should have expected what this movie had, from the time period in which it was made.  Still, not-so-closet feminist that I am, I was REALLY disappointed in this movie. It was mainly about, (if I remember correctly), one woman's knowledge of her husband's affair, and not wanting ""the other woman"", (a close friend), to know that she knew this.  I am ALL for the institution of marriage, and also ALL for divorce, if things sadly don't work out, and the marriage only serves to make each person in it miserable...but this movie was only full of catty conversations, (clever and witty though they are), and women talking about marriages that go apart, and being nasty to one another.  There is one little girl in this movie, and I remember clearly being sorry for her: I mean, is THIS all she has to look foreward to, as she grows older?

If I don't remember much of the plot, I suppose this is psychological
elf-preservation on my part.  Little -- if anything -- is mentioned about ""The Women""'s careers, if, that is, any of them have them.  Their main concern, (and career), seems to be holding on to, or seeking out, husbands whether they love them or not.  There is precious little, (if any), friendship between these women -- just clever, catty conversation.  Famous REAL women -- such as Muriel Siebert, Marie Curie, Madeline Albright, Eleanor Roosevelt, Meryl Streep, or even Queen Elizabeth II -- would find little to be comfortaable with, amongst the sly, manipulative, malicious, mean,  and secretive women characters in this movie.

I suppose, during the time this play was written, that such ""husband-hunting"", and ""husband-keeping"" were all of the ""careers"" that were open to women.  No -- wait a minute!  Even then, women could be secretaries, teachers, and nurses.  There were also many women who wrote both fiction and non-fiction.  Women painters and pianists.  Women who played other instruments in the orchestra -- and even women who composed music that other people played!  There were also, then, (and now!), men and women who really did love each other, and who had long and successful, (and happy!), marriages.  Men and women who respected each other, too.  But here, even women don't resepct each other!

It is also interesting to note that the novels of Georgette Heyer -- which were set in Regency England, a long time BEFORE the period during which ""The Women"" takes place, and a period in which women had even fewer rights than they did in the 1930s and 1940s -- still portray women with higher regard for themselves, and others, than the argumntative and sneaky women in ""The Women"".  Why?  Because the characters in Gerogette Heyer's Regency novels all have SELF-RESPECT.  Putting down others is NOT their primary goal, in and of itself.  No, they will NOT let others take advantage of them -- but Georgette Heyer's women characters are more interested in accomplishing their goals, than in putting other people down.  While trying to achieve THEIR ends, Ms. Heyer's characters ALWAYS have SELF-respect upper-most in their minds.

Fyodor Dostoyevsky wrote, (paraphrased), that ""happy families are all alike, and therefore, boring.  It is the unhappy families which are interesting....""  I have always felt Dostoyevsky wrong here -- and the movie, (and play), ""The Women"" proves it. Here, we see that it is the UNHAPPY families that, if not all alike, (no mention of loving families where there is sickness and/or poverty is present -- or cam these actually be happy -- ie, loving -- families, upon whom sad times have come?), are greatly similar. Mainly, they have UNloving, catty, malicious, husband-hunting and husband-keeping females in them, to whom just BEING married is the most important thing -- with or, (as here), usually without love.  But there ARE differences in HAPPY families.  To give an example from TV families: the families on ""Family Ties"", ""Father Knows Best"", ""Empty Nest"", ""McMillian and Wife"", and ""That Girl"" have family members who are all (basically), happy in each other's company -- but are all vastly, vastly different.

I cannot understand why ANYONE would enjoy watching ""The Women"". It has SO many female stereotypes in it that it makes me, (also a woman), squirm in the greatest of disocmfort.  I imagine that any man with an ounce of respect, (or at least, curiousity), about women, watching this movie, would say to himself: ""Is THIS all I have to look forward to, when I get married?""

No, dear sir, fortunately, it is not.  Women are, when one gets right down to it, just fellow(?) human beings.  Women may have SOME proclivities that men do not, (and vice versa) -- but these are very, very minimal.  All human beings, as I mentioned at the start of this review, basically want the same things.  Amongst these, (which I neglected to mention at the beginning...but did touch on later), is RESPECT.  Mutual respect between human beings -- whether between men and men, women and women, or men and women -- fulfills the basic human need to think to one's self: ""I am important in this world.  I have worth!""  The stereotyped ""women"", in the movie and play, ""The Women"", have just about no self-respect.  Nor do they respect others.  They are shallow, one-dimensional characters.  Why is ""The Women"" considered a classic?  I don't know.  And I think I never shall.",1263686400,6,5924,4.879

This movie is chock full of leading ladies, each one more interesting and funnier than the next.  The very last scene was rather dated and silly but the overall movie was just plain enjoyable.

One notable part of the film is the tension between Mary (played by Norma Shearer) and Crystal (played by Joan Crawford) over Crystal's affair with Mary's husband. Off-screen Shearer and Crawford disliked each other so intensely that the movie's producer's had some difficulty keeping the film on track. I believe that conflict contributes to their believable onscreen performance.

Another fascinating aspect of the movie is the fact that while most of the conversations in the movie concern men, not a single man actually appears in the film.

The conceit of ""The Women"" is that it's just that: women.  There are no male actors, and male characters (those dastardly husbands) are only talked about, or ""appear"" just offstage.

As a guy, I particularly enjoyed Norma Shearer's mother character, who chided her daughter for being too angry about her husband's philandering.  ""Boys will be boys,"" she said.  ""How can you think about leaving your husband and taking from him the best piece of protection he has while seeing that conniving wench: his legal marriage?""  Had to laugh at that, the mom making her daughter feel guilty for wanting to leave her cheating husband.  Another highlight: a particularly radiant Paulette Goddard, who plays one of Norma Shearer's many female friends.

At 133 minutes, the movie is a bit long for its subject matter (wives complaining about their husbands, even in a frothy comedy, is good for about an hour and forty-five minutes tops, in my book), but the length isn't a fatal flaw, especially on DVD when you can take a break whenever you want.

790185,5,6304056958,"""The Women"" will go down in movie history as the quentiessential ladies film.  The central character, Mary Haines (Norma Shearer), is the one who is enduring her share of pain when learning of her husband's affair with a sneaky department store clerk (MGM studio rival Joan Crawford).  With Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Lucile Watson, Marjorie Main and other cast members providing noted performances, ""The Women"" was directed with skill and strong, entertainment quality by the legendary George Cukor, who took the screenplay from the Clare Boothe Luce Broadway comedy that ran for a then-record 666 performances.  And, yes, who can forget the technicolor fashion scene with the high fashions of 1939 flashing before your eyes?  This is a comedy for the ages.  To today's moviegoers, Norma Shearer is best remembered for ""The Women"" as opposed to her other films such as ""Marie Antoinette,"" ""The Divorcee"" (her only Oscar-winner), ""A Free Soul,"" to name a few.  This marked Shearer's last ""great film"" appearance, although she would do two more MGM films before leaving the screen in 1942.  As Mary, she nurtures a daughter, gets advice from her mother, and uses ""Jungle Red"" to later get back the man of her life from Crawford.  The fight scene between Russell and Goddard was hilarious to the hilt as the ladies settle down on a western ranch away from New York City.  And Mary Boland's countess was interesting with her emphasis on la'mour, la'mour, la'mour (love in French).

With an all-female cast, ""The Women"" shows bonding, feuding, and glamour in one, golden package.  A must-see for all.",1231200000,,1605,5.064638783269962
790186,5,6304056958,"While the story line may not have been to my taste, the acting in this movie is wonderful. The women are all interesting and well cast. The movie held my attention from beginning to end. I've seen it on TV a couple of times over the years and I'm sure will watch it again.

The one thing that always confuses me is if Norma Shearer's character was so wonderful, why did her husband stray? If he was that weak, why did she want him back? Maybe things like this just happen and there isn't always a logical explanation, but it wasn't realistic to me. Once he left her, she should have gone and never looked back.

The more I see some of these older movies, the more I love them mostly because they were so well directed and acted. What some of these movies show is that a movie can have adult themes without being completely vulgar and juvenile.

~ ""Mrs. Moorehead"" in Clare Booth Luce's ""The Women""

""The Women,"" one of the many spectacular films of 1939, explores love, marriage and divorce from the strictly female point of view. Not a single male character is shown in the film, nor in the play by Clare Booth Luce, upon which the movie was based, although the conversation constantly swirls around the husbands and boyfriends of the protagonists. While the women involved are wealthy socialites, many of their follies, sins and heartbreaks are those which pervade the lives of the female sex in every time and place. The ease of securing a divorce, however, is an issue confronting modern people; Mrs. Luce dissects with slow, brilliant cruelty the pain and devastation that goes with breaking up a family. No matter how cordial and legally effortless the parting of ways can be, it is almost impossible to escape upheaval, scandal, and tears.

The Women revolves around the lovely Mary Haines (Norma Shearer), who discovers that her previously devoted husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop girl. The gossip of her friends contributes in no small way to the destruction of the situation. The pivotal moment is when Mary refuses to listen to the wise words of her mother, Mrs. Moorehead (Lucile Watson) who begs her to ignore the infidelity and stop confiding in her friends. ""They will see that you lose both your husband and your home."" She also implores Mary to consider her young daughter, who must come first no matter what.

Indeed, the little girl is torn to pieces when Mary tells her that the divorce is imminent. One of the saddest scenes shows the child sobbing in private, ""Oh, Mother, oh, Daddy!"" knowing that the home she has known is gone forever. It is also disturbing how the daughter must later have to deal with her father's cheap new wife. Watching ""The Women"" always makes me annoyed at both Mary and Stephen for allowing their child to be exposed to such circumstances. But Mary wants to get back at her husband for hurting her more than she wants anything else. She seeks divorce on almost an impulse as pain dominates her reason. She comes to bitterly regret it.

In spite of the heaviness of the topic, ""The Women"" is fraught with humor; the dialog is one of the wittiest ever to grace the screen. And I do not think that there is single weak performance. Norma Shearer is sweetly sympathetic even when it would be nice to slap her. Joan Crawford is at her slutty best as ""Crystal,"" the callous home wrecker. Rosalind Russell is hilarious as the gossiping Cousin Sylvia, who basically rejoices over Mary's misfortune. Paulette Goddard is the goodhearted wench who tells Mary what's what. A remake is debuting this year; it seems a little coarser and less elegant than the original, but then, of course, it is a reflection of our time.",1214352000,,2884,4.762
790363,5,6304056958,"This movie rocks! The cast was stellar. The idea of gossip and its consequences is a great theme for a movie/play.

Rosalind Russell as a nasty woman, yet with a lot of physical comedy was excellent.

790366,5,6304056958,"Besides perhaps ""Mildred Pierce,"" ""The Women"" is absolutely Joan's most famous and much-loved classic film. I really love this movie because it's so well put together, all of the performances are tops and the story is second to none. As you may know already, in this film, Joan plays man-eater, Crystal Allen. Crystal will stop at nothing to sink her claws into Mr. Stephen Haines. And of course it doesn't matter to her that he's a presumably happily married man to everyone's favorite sweetheart, Mary, otherwise known as Mrs. Stephen Haines.

My favorite clips from this movie are probably your favorites as well. I love the scene with Joan in the bathtub on the phone (they didn't have cordless phones back then so it behooves the imagination, where exactly did she stick the cord?) I love the fashion show and the part with Crystal being confronted by holier-than-thou Mary.

When Joan had a hit, she often loved to make 2 or 3 more movies with very similar plots because she didn't want to disappoint her public. A couple of years after filming ""The Women,"" Joan made a similar movie, ""When Ladies Meet."" The plot is very similar, but the script and and overall performances were nowhere near as sensational as in this.

Even during Hollywood's Golden Age this film still stands out. The movie almost has an operatic feel to it because it's almost like a musical. All of the lines are almost magical or even poetic.

Claire Boothe Luce wrote the play in the 20s and it was a hit, although it almost missed out being produced because the author insisted that all of the sets and especially the clothes be the sine qua non--ka ching, ka ching. The same holds true for the film, adapted for the screen by Anita Loos, which even has an Adrian fashion show in Technicolor (but WHO wore those cumbersome clothes in real life?).

The sets are places where Manhattan Matrons might be found, elegant department and dress stores, one another's bridge tables, trips to Bermuda, dude ranches, limited edition trains, Elizabeth Arden's and smart nightspots. All very well rendered in this outstanding production.

Supporting cast members include a caterwauling Marjorie Main, sultry Paulette Goddard, the doe eyed Joan Fontaine, charming little Virginia Weidler and Mary Boland as Flora, Countess DeLave, the much married marriage mill heiress.

The break up of Shearer's marriage is told with tenderness, and the viewers long for her to take her mother's advice.

790510,4,6304056958,"The constant verbal jousting in this 1939 classic has layers of vitriolic wit and honest insight thanks to the sharp script penned by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin from Clare Booth Luce's legendary 1936 females-only Broadway hit. Crisply directed by George Cukor who is completely in his milieu here, the movie is really a mid-20th century survivor's guide for wealthy, insulated women seeking comfort and security in a world where they are defined solely by their husbands. While it is still an accomplished film in many respects, the 133-minute running time feels overly long as the mile-a-minute catty comments grow wearisome despite the deftness of their delivery by an estimable ensemble cast.

The plot is straightforward. Socialite Mary Haines is a loving wife and mother whose decade-long marriage produces a wandering eye in her off-screen husband Stephen. Once he takes up with a predatory perfume salesgirl named Crystal Allen, Mary takes the train west to Reno for a divorce at which point Stephen and Crystal marry. But Mary is determined to win him back, as she knows full well that Crystal will eventually tire of Stephen and move on to greener pastures. It all ends in a bracing series of confrontations in what looks to be the world's largest powder room. What makes this story richer than the outline of events is the multi-voiced flow of gossip and advice pummeling Mary from her immediate social circle, in particular, her vituperative cousin and apparent best friend Sylvia Fowler.

The three leads are impeccably cast. As the virtuous Mary, Norma Shearer is saddled with the dullest part since she has to react to the shenanigans circling her. However, she radiates her trademark class and a genuine sense of warmth. Joan Crawford was born to play the rapacious Crystal as she dynamically conveys the cynicism of her character's motives. Even though the main conflict is between Mary and Crystal, classic scene-stealer Rosalind Russell makes Sylvia a perfectly venal yet oddly endearing character with her wacky outfits and slapstick pratfalls. Over 130 women surround this trio, including a gallery of memorable characters embodied by an impressive bevy of studio-era actresses from Mary Boland's over-the-top Countess DeLave to a young pre-Hitchcock Joan Fontaine as irritatingly demure Peggy to Paulette Goddard's no-nonsense Miriam to Lucile Watson as Mary's worldly wise mother to Marjorie Main as the loud Reno dude ranch operator.

Even with the inclusion of a knockdown catfight between Russell and Goddard, the film gets overly dramatic at times, highlighting Shearer's penchant for grand lady mannerisms, and there is a completely excisable ten-minute fashion show shot in early Technicolor to show off Adrian's extravagant costume designs. Special mention should be given to Cedric Gibbons' luxuriant art direction and Edwin Willis' set designs. The 2005 DVD has two vintage shorts of marginal interest - ""Hollywood: Style Center of the World"" about Adrian's fashion influence on everyday wear by American women, and ""From the Ends of the Earth: Another Romance of Celluloid"" about the use of textile imports in studio films. There is also a trailer for the film as well as one for the unnecessary 1956 musical remake, ""The Opposite Sex"". Completely disposable is an alternate black-and-white version of the fashion show and over forty minutes of original score and source music cues.",1168992000,2,3414,5.237659963436928

790513,5,6304056958,"Ignore myths of sisterhood. Women can be nasty, catty, devious, gossipy and gleeful -- especially about each other. So expect lots of that in ""The Women,"" a screwball comedy about divorce, remarriage, affairs and lots and lots of inner feuding. It's a practically perfect girls' movie.

The uppermost ladies of Manhattan lunch, spa, shop and especially gossip together. So when Mary Haines' (Norma Shearer) hubby takes a perfume-counter mistress Crystal (Joan Crawford), the other women try to keep it from her. But Mary finds out, and after confronting her husband with his infidelity, she demands a divorce -- and so it's off to Reno with her goody-two-shoes pal Peggy (Joan Fontaine).

She spends the next few weeks at a ranch with other soon-to-be-divorced women, including her neurotic cousin, a much-divorced countess and a vixen. And though Mary still loves her husband, he feels obligated to marry Crystal. But then Mary's daughter reveals some juicy new information about Crystal -- and Mary's pals band together to help her set things right.

""The Women"" is an all-star cast, with all women. Not a man to be seen or even heard (although I can't vouch for the animals) -- even the kids are all girls. This allows the attention to remain on The Women, whether it's the naive girls, kindly matrons or the catty hens.

The original play was by Clare Boothe Luce, but Anita Loos gives it her own witty spin.  And Loos -- the original chick-litter -- knew how to spin witty, sparking dialogue without breaking a sweat (""She's got those eyes that run up and down a man like a searchlight!"").

The plot moves at a fast pace, with the occasional lull, where we get some barbed dialogue about marriage and infidelity. Few movies can handle catfights in a really funny manner (Sylvia biting Miriam on the leg), throw in some insights about men and women's relationships, a dash of romance, revenge, and a climactic battle that involves a broom closet.

Shearer, Paulette Goddard and Mary Boland are all great as women hardened and strengthened by having their guy stolen; Rosalind Russell is hilarious as Shearer's immature, weirdly-dressed cousin, and Joan Crawford is as slimy and vicious as her role demands. The one dark spot is Virginia Weidler, who basically has to simper and whimper -- sadly, because she was delightful in ""Philadelphia Story.""

""The Women"" prove that oftentimes, the female of the species is more deadly -- and more resourceful -- than the male. Hilarious, witty and wonderfully catty.",1158278400,7,2510,4.95952380952381
790514,5,6304056958,"This film may have gone a long way to typecasting George Cukor as a ""women's"" director.  The description was patently unfair because George Cukor was simply a great director, period. Such films as Philadelphia Story, Adam's Rib, A Double Life, Gaslight, and his uncredited work on Gone With the Wind clearly establish that he was one of Hollywood's great directors and not just a women's director.

The Women, which has long been a camp classic and fodder for many spoofs is a star-studded hoot. This is due in large part to the wonderful performances of Rosalind Russell, Norma Shearer (it is a shame that this Queen of MGM is not remembered well), Joan Crawford, Marjorie Main, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, and the hysterically delicious Mary Boland.  The scene where Rosalind Russell and Phyllis Povah go to spy on Joan Crawford in the department store is high point as well as Mary Boland as the Countess DeLave decribing how she hates the mountains. Frankly anything Mary Boland did was wonderful (check out Pride and Prejudice).  The performances of Joan Fontaine and Virginia Weidler (Little Mary Haines) seem dated now, however they fit wonderfully into the film.

The Women is a rarity because it is one of the only Hollywood films made where the cast is entirely women and there is no man to be seen.  This is a must see for anyone who wants to see what Hollywood films once were.

790519,4,6304056958,"Directed by George Cukor in 1939, from Clare Boothe Luce's satire of women's vicious and predatory nature in New York's upper class, The Women features a powerhouse cast of actresses, some only beginning long and distinguished careers. In this drama, a clique of society friends feeds off the gossip they learn from a manicurist in a nail salon. Sylvia Fowler, played superbly by Rosalind Russell, discovers, quite by accident, that Mary Haines's husband, Stephen, is having an affair with a shop girl who works behind the perfume counter at the ritzy department store where the friends shop. Crystal Allen (a pre-dark-eyebrow Joan Crawford) has set her sights on the wealthy Stephen, playing a masterful cat and mouse game of seduction. Mary (Norma Shearer), although brokenhearted, refuses to acknowledge the affair, hoping her husband will come to his senses. Wisely counseled by an astute mother, Mary is given two pieces of advice: ""every man is prone to fall for the charms of a strange woman, bored by himself and his responsibilities"" and ""don't solicit advice from your girlfriends"", because they will steer you toward divorce.

Sylvia (Russell) rallies to Mary's defense, although she is the worst and most vicious gossip of them all. Visiting the perfume counter to give Crystal a hard time, Sylvia recognizes a like-minded spirit. Mary travels to Reno for a divorce, where she makes new friends, including Paulette Goddard, whose characters has stolen Sylvia Fowler's husband. When Mary and her new friends return to New York, Stephen has married Crystal, although she is already cheating on Stephen, her comeuppance on the horizon. With this group of women, soon more gossip begins, this time about Crystal and her secret affair. Eventually, all is made right between Mary and Stephen and Crystal is shown up for the conniving social-climber that she is. The dialog is snappy, the delivery a mile a minute, the gaggle of chattering ladies spiting out rapid-fire lines. The elegant Norma Shearer is perfect as the wronged woman, patient and long-suffering, but only to a point, when she stands up to the brittle and grasping Crystal. This is old Hollywood at its satirical best and most self-important, an upper-class drama with top screen stars, couture fashions, an upbeat score that is almost playful and the emotional tug-of-war between the heroine and the arch-villainess. In her diva-like superiority, Crystal's spits, ""You noble wives and mothers bore the brains out of me.""

This war of the titans generates a blistering satire on the affairs of women, in this case, wealthy New Yorker's whose days are spent in idle mischief. Bearing in mind that this movie was released in 1939, one line shocked me, inserted towards the end of the movie, as Mary's mother comforts her daughter after the divorce. She explains that the single life has its compensations: ""Heaven knows it's marvelous to spread out in bed like a swastika!"" Luan Gaines/2005.",1125360000,2,2961,5.115702479338843

Well, she gets her divorce, but in time, the gig becomes up for Ms Crystal, and Shearer is back in the game; Rosalind Russell gives a good performance of the lady with a sharp tongue who gets a dose of her OWN medicine(HMM).

Although I find the all female cast quite interesting, I wanted to shake my head as well; OK, this is the 30s here and most women believed(even now) that it was better to have with a Mr than not; So for it's time it is a bit dated, but the fact that women dominate the story is quite novel if not interesting and has not been brought up much since;",1112659200,,1054,4.4051282051282055
790575,5,6304056958,"THE WOMEN, Clare Boothe Luce's blistering all-female comedy, has lost none if little of it's hilariously catty humour, more than half a century since it was originally released.  George Cukor directs the picture which stars almost every single female performer who was signed to MGM at the period.

Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) discovers that her husband is having an affair with money-hungry perfume counter girl Chrystal Allen (Joan Crawford).  Aided and abetted by her cousin Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell) and her army of girlfriends, Mary sets out to win back her man...and teach Chrystal a lesson or two in the process!

Other main roles are taken by Joan Fontaine as the meek little Peggy Day, Paulette Goddard as  wisecracking Miriam Aarons, Lucile Watson as Mary's wise mother and Mary Boland as the hilarious Countess DeLave (who keeps wandering around ruefully talking about ""l'amour""!).  Virginia Weidler plays Mary's daughter.

George Cukor earned his reputation as a ""woman's director"" thanks to this film, and while he was exceptional in drawing out thrilling performances from his leading ladies (Ingrid Bergman in GASLIGHT springs to mind), he was also no slouch in directing men.

The Technicolor 'fashion parade' sequence is quite gimmicky and drags the pace of the film down; indeed it does nothing to advance the story.  However, this is just one small quibble.  THE WOMEN is a comedic masterpiece and justifiably so.",1112140800,5,1439,5.217391304347826

She overhears that her husband has been cheating on her, having an affair with shopgirl Crystal Allen (played by a wonderfully evil Joan Crawford). After much trial and tribulation, Mary ends up on the train for Reno to get a divorce. But in order to find out what happens in the second half of the movie, you'll have to see it yourself!

While Shearer and Crawford are both excellent in their roles, I must say that this film belongs to the two strongest supporting actresses, Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard. Russell plays Shearer's cousin and ""best friend"", Sylvia Fowler, and Goddard plays a gal Shearer becomes friends with at Reno. The cat fight between Russell and Goddard is one of the BEST examples of physical comedy I have ever had the delight of seeing (I actually watched it in slow motion once). Russell talks about a hundred words a second, so try to keep up!

Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford steal the show and Rosalind Russell of Auntie Mame fame gives one of her best performances.  I appreciated Cukor's brilliant use of color for the fashion show sequence and some of the cinmatography throughout the film is truly thrilling.  The ending is the best part of the film with a comical and fast paced cat fight and Crawford getting her come uppance.,1075766400,4,471,4.650602409638554

I watched it a couple of times before realizing there is not one man in the whole picture...I recomend this movie to anyone who likes a real classic....",1071532800,2,371,4.621212121212121
790630,5,6304056958,"Mary Haines believes she has the perfect life with a wonderful husband and loving daughter.  Perfect, that is, until she hears the idle gossip from the woman at the spa about how Mr. Haines has taken up with Crystal Allen, a shopgirl who sells perfume.  Listening to her friends Sylvia Fowler, Edith Potter, and Peggy Day, Mary does all she can to win back her husband from the scheming arms of Crystal.
This Geroge Cukor film has one of the sharpest scripts written for the screen, and features many of the Golden Era's best actresses: Norma Shearer as Mary Haines; Joan Crawford as the conniving shopgirl Crystal; Joan Fontaine as the innocent Peggy Day; and in one of the best performances, Rosalind Russell as the fast-talking Syliva Folwer.  Her rapid-fire delivery of some of the most sarcastic lines is amazing to watch, and she gives the character much comic flair.  Marjorie Main pops in for a while as Lucy, who runs a ranch in Reno for women going through divorces.  In a short but fantastic scene, Virginia Grey plays Pat, another shopgirl working with Crystal who can't help but try to unnerve Crystal while she's on the phone with Mr. Haines.  Even columnist Hedda Hopper makes a brief appearance toward the end of the film.
Two other remarkable notes about this film:  of the 135-member cast, there is not one man present in the film.  And two: the film is black and white, with the exception of a fashion show sequence toward the middle of the film which is shown in glorious technicolor.  It's a bit lengthy but marvelous to look at all those fashions designed by Adrian (who has quite a long list of memorable films to his design credits).
The DVD is a restored version of the film.  (The difference can be seen in the alternate version of the fshion show sequence included as a bonus.)  Also, there are two short films: one about the romance of the cinemal the other about using the movies to influence the fashion trends around the world.  Wonderful bits of movie history.  This is a great film, full of smart dialogue and great acting.  A true cinema classic.",1071014400,5,2080,4.647540983606557
790631,4,6304056958,"This is a wonderfully dated (though still very relevant) and thoroughly entertaining comedy from the genius George Cukor. Perfect Wife Norma Shearer's marriage hits the rocks when her less-than-perfect husband begins an affair with the sluttish shopgirl Joan Crawford. Her friends rally round her as she ignores, complains, divorces, and finally rediscovers her own self-worth.
The performances are wonderful. Shearer is winsome and emotional, Crawford is venomous and ambitious (though we don't see enough of her character), and Rosalind Russell steals the show as the scheming, manipulative and two-faced 'Friend' you'd like to hit with a bus. The dialogue is spectacular, comparable in places with Bette Davis in her magnificent opus 'All About Eve', and the ensemble cast of over 150 women hangs together beautifully.
The direction, too, is superior, and Cukor exacts almost superhuman expressions and angles from the 'Faces' - Crawford, Russell and, most of all, Shearer. The gowns, hats, gloves, shoes, furs and jewelery in 'The Women' play almost as important a part in the picture as the cast members themselves, and the 'glorious technicolour' fashion show is a gem.
Sadly, 'The Women' suffers from the same syndrome as all Stage-to-Screen movies do. In a theatre, with scene and time restrictions, the audience depends on dialogue and character interaction for entertainment. In movies, such restrictions don't exist, and 'The Women', like 'Cabaret', 'The Sound of Music' and 'Funny Girl' after it, suffers from a 30-minute or so period in the centre, where it unfortunately loses its momentum. However, the ending is wonderful, especially Crawford's line about Kennels, and for anybody, 'The Women' stands the test of time as an illustration of the awful and hilarious power of gossip.",1065484800,4,1796,5.395017793594306

You will have to watch it a few times to make sure you don't miss a single witty remark, double take or physical bit.

The fashion show sequence in Technicolor is an absolute delight, even though the fashions are a bit overblown as well. The DVD quality is top, and there are some interesting and well presented extras. By the way: none of the reviewers note the apperance of Virginia Gray, one of the most beautiful women in the films of the period, scarcely to be seen nowadays. She is wearing a rather heavy and stange hairdo, but I trust it is because she has scenes with Joan Crawford, who probably never allowed a more beautiful younger woman to appear in the same frame with her, let alone steal it.",1057881600,,848,4.512987012987013

It has become a camp classic, but it's really a classic, and when you see it alone, you realize certain things about it that are not apparent in a screaming audience.
  1) Shearer's performance is excellent -- and in the least flashy role.
  2) The whole movie is a case of bizarre casting that worked surprisingly well.  Three examples:
  a)Shearer.  She didn't play women like this usually.  She played sexually sophisticated ladies -- even after the Production Code.  But she brings a probity to this role that has become inextricably linked with her cinematic image (to a degree that has actually done her a disservice) mainly because she is so good here.
  b) Crawford.  She is supposed to be sexy young thing who steals away Shearer's husband.  But Crawford was at least ten years older than the role, and a good five years too old for the part.  At 35, she looked like a hard 40, and no younger than Shearer.  It's hard to conceive of any man dumping his family for such an obvious barricuda -- especially one who looks like a guy in drag.  And YET -- she's great in the role.  A lot of fun.  And Crawford, as she often did, brings all of her bitterness and resentment to the role, and it works.
  c) Rosalind Russell.  Who'd have ever thought she had THAT in her.

  Also check out Paulette Godard, again, different from anything else she ever did (and looking better than anybody in the movie.)  Now GODARD is what Crystal was SUPPOSED to look like -- not like Wallace Beery in a bathtub.",1048809600,6,1641,4.493197278911564

790706,5,6304056958,"How does one take a totally acidic down right risqu Broadway play and transform its wickedly perverse dialogue into a brutally funny cinematic experience. Well, if you're director, George Cukor - working under the rigid constraints of a production code that does not permit such lascivious banter then you simply ask the show's scenarist, Anita Loos to write even more acidic double entendres to get her point across. The result: ""The Women"" (1939) an inspired and scathing, divinely hilarious comedy with 135 women and NO men.

The plot centers on Mary Haines (Norma Shearer), blissfully living in her fool's paradise as the happy wife and contented mother. That is, until she accidentally learns that her husband Steven is having an off camera affair with ruthless man trap Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). Determined to, first, save her marriage, then later, live the remainder of her days as the carefree divorcee, Mary eventually comes to an understanding. She wants Steven back!

Mary's gaggle of fair weather friends include her vapid and gossipy cousin, Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell), nave ingnue Peggy Day (Joan Fontaine), the ruthlessly charming Countess DeLav (Mary Boland) and vixen on the make Miriam Aarons (Paulette Goddard). At one point the film degenerates into a riotous cat fight complete with pulled hair, lots of kicking and even a racy full bodied bite on the thigh. Buttressed by its stellar performances, outstanding dialogue and a fashion show sequence shot in blazing Technicolor (in an otherwise B&W film), ""The Women"" is 99 and 1/2 % pure magic. Only its ending leaves something to be desired.

Crawford and Shearer were hardly the best of friends. Both divas at MGM, Crawford was fond of saying of Norma, ""How can I compete with her? She sleeps with the boss!"" True, but Shearer was married to VP, Irving Thalberg at the time. Fearful that ""The Women"" would prove the catalyst for a real life catfight, Cukor kept the two actresses separate for as much of the shoot as possible. He really had nothing to fear: both Crawford and Shearer behaved like total professionals both on and off camera and their mutual dissention worked marvelously well in their on screen confrontations.

Warner's DVD is a miracle of mastering. The B&W picture exhibits a near pristine rendering with an exemplary gray scale, solid deep blacks, perfectly realized contrast levels and very clean whites. The Technicolor fashion show is so vibrantly realized it seems to burst into 3-dimensionality off of the screen. Rarely does pixelization intrude for a very smooth, thoroughly satisfying visual presentation. Fine details are so breathtakingly defined that close ups often yield the thickness of make up and accuracy of hair strands and fabrics used in costumes. Only during the opening credits is there a subtle hint of misregistration that results in a slight haloing effect around lettering and main title art work, but neither is distracting. The audio is mono and extremely well balanced.  Extras include the complete isolated musical score and a ""Romance of Celluloid"" short subject on Hollywood style.

Any year but 1939 and ""The Women"" would surely have won Best Picture. In the year of ""Gone With The Wind"" it never had a chance. Thankfully, we'll always have the film on DVD.",1046390400,17,3293,5.088888888888889
790707,5,6304056958,"This movie is tops, its a classic of gossip, marriages, scandal, he said, she said, knives in backs, cutthroat, but most of all this movie teaches What Goes Around Comes Around. A lot of the movies of 1930s about these same subjects didn't succeed, this one is tops. I love Myrna Loy, I wish Myrna Loy would of been in this movie, I can picture her in this film. I didn't think much of Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer before seeing this movie. But they were very talented actresses. Even though most of the women didn't get along on the set, they all needed each other to make the movie a hit. Virginia Grey and Paulette Goddard were my favorite. Virginia Grey was beautiful, in the little scene she had, she had a presence and her presence is known, I wish she would of done more in the movie and in Hollywood. Rosalind Russell was something else, she was one of the top female comedians, but I wish the fight scene between her and Paulette Goddard could of been more juicy and action packed like the remake of The Women- The Opposite Sex, but anyways I know  I'm sure every woman knows Rosalind Russell kind, gossiping about everybody else, but hates when people gossips about her, and most of all her own home isn't taken care of. I love it when her man leave her for another woman, every knows but her, she didn't like it when the tables turned on her. But at least Norma Shearer was a lady, Rosalind Russell acted as a baby. This movie was a stepping stone for such new actresses like Joan Fontaine, Paulette Goddard, Virginia Grey and others, and this movie was also like a last hurrah for Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer who was about to leave MGM and was considered old by Hollywood standards, the good roles were going to other young starlets. Rosalind Russell was right in the middle of her successful career. One funny thing about this movie, the women who are gossiping don't think their gossiping, they think its INFORMATION. Women can learn something from this film, men cheating on their wives with younger women to make them feel young, so its just a phase, Norma Shearer knew her man would come back, she didn't let her gossiping friends mess with her mind, Norma Shearer had it all planned it out. I was reading some other posts that said some people will think this movie is old-fashion, times change, Cheating mates is and old game, the only difference is women today will fight, women back then was smart like Norma Shearer. Women like Joan Crawford character think they got it all and will win over the wife, but she gets hurt everytime. Women like Rosalind Russell character are still around and acive, I bet we women can name those, we might had them as friends, one thing I know about women like Rosalind Russell character is that they gossip about everybody else business, but their business at home isn't taken care of, and they hate when people gossip about them. There should be more women like Norma Shearer character. This film is good, regardless of age, race, generation. They don't make movies ilke this no more. This was made in 1939. but nothing old-fahion about this movie. The only lesson learned in this movie is What goes around, comes around.

My own personal favourite actress, Rosalind Russell, is a stand out in the cast as the meddlesome Sylvia who gets her just deserts in fabulous comic terms by the film's end.  Roz would go onto to great things in the coming years as this film was a spring board to her becoming the screen's greatest comic actress.

Whatta CAT FIGHT!!!
I've loved this film for years -- perhaps more every time I see it!  This was the classroom for those ""Dynasty"" broads!  It is surely one of the best examples of ensemble performance.
The first inkling I ever had of this film was in the 197(?) Los Angeles Film Exposition's tribute to Rosalind Russell.  They showed clips from about 15 of her films, and what they showed from ""The Women"" was the exercise scene.  After that, I was on a mission to see the film (prevideo!).  But, Roz isn't the only star shining -- they all do -- even the bit players (""So, whatta they want you to do?  Lay an egg?"").
The script by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin (adapted from the Clare Boothe play) is extraordinarily wonderful.  What dialogue!
If you haven't had an appreciation for Norma Shearer before, -- well, you certainly will after seeing this film.  And Joan Crawford -- ""Crystal Allen"" may be the woman we'll all like to hate best forever.
Oddly, there was no Academy Award nomination for any aspect of this film (perhaps there was an anti-George Cukor movement abroad in 1939 -- he was fired from ""Gone With the Wind"" remember), not even Adrian's costumes (just get a load of what he put on Roz!).

Norman Sherer does a fine job with her role as Mary Hainey, but who shines is Rosalind Russell as her sharp witted friend. (Rosalind goes on to win a Golden Globe for her role in Auntie Mame--1954).
What makes The Women fascinating is the way they tackle such a taboo topic as divorce, infidelity, betrayal and revenge.

790714,5,6304056958,"The female of the species goes jungle red in tooth and claw in this brilliant screen adaptation of Claire Boothe Luce's famous Broadway play--a wickedly funny portrait of 1930s society women whose lives revolve around beauty treatments, luncheons, fashion shows, and each other's men.  Socialite Mary Haines is the envy of her set: rich, beautiful, and happily married... but when her husband steps out on her with a gold-digging perfume counter sales clerk, Mary's so-called friends dish enough dirt to make divorce inevitable whether Mary wants it or not.

The script is wickedly, mercilessly funny, fast paced, razor sharp and filled with such memorable invective that you'll be quoting it for weeks and months afterward: ""He says he'd like to do Sylvia's nails right down to the wrist with a buzz-saw;"" ""Why that old gasoline truck, she's sixty if she's a minute;"" ""Gimme a bromide--and put some gin in it!""  And the all-female cast, which includes every one from Cora Witherspoon to Butterfly McQueen to Hedda Hopper, plays it with tremendous spark.

This was the last significant starring role for Norma Shearer, one of MGM's greatest stars of the 1930s, and she aquits herself very well as the much-wronged Mary Haines.  But the real winners are the members of the supporting cast.  Joan Crawford is truly astonishing as Crystal Allen, the shop girl who leads Mary's husband astray, and Rosalind Russell gives an outrageously funny performance as the back-biting gossip whose nasty comments precipitate Mary's divorce.  Indeed, it is hard to do anything except rave about the entire the cast, which includes such diverse performers as Marjorie Main, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, and Lucille Watson.  Even the smallest bit parts score with one-liners that have the impact of a slap in the face, and director George Cukor does an incredible job of keeping everything and every one in sharp focus.

Perhaps one of the most interesting things about THE WOMEN is the way in which director Cukor ties the behavior of its characters to their social status. Possessed of absolute leisure and considerable wealth, their energies are inevitably directed into competition for the ultimate status symbol: a successful man.  Cukor allows us to sympathize with Mary (Shearer) and laugh at Sylvia (Russell), but he also requires us to pity them--and indirectly encourages gruding admiration for the devious Crystal (Crawford) and the savvy Miriam (Goddard), characters who are considerably more self-reliant.  Consequently, not only does THE WOMEN paint a poisoniously funny portait of women as a sex, it takes a hatchet to the society that has shaped their characters as well.

Unfortunately, this landmark comedy has not received the full benefit of what DVD offers.  Although the print is crisp, the film has not been restored, and the extras are spurious and hardly do the film justice; while I would recommend the DVD simply because you're likely to wear out a VHS, the DVD has no great advantage over the VHS release.  But whether you have it on VHS or DVD, this is one title that you must have in your collection: you'll watch it again and again.  A must-have.

790756,5,6304056958,"This is a film that has withstood the test of time. It is every bit as entertaining, as when it was first first released back in 1939. The film is an outstanding example of pre-World War II opulence and elegance with its gorgeous art deco sets. Based upon a play by Claire Booth Luce, it boast a snappy and witty screenplay by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin. In the hands of legendary director, George Cukor, this film is sharp, funny, and memorable with stellar performances given by the entire cast. Boasting an all female ensemble, with nary a male in sight, the film revolves around men. How to get 'em. How to keep 'em. How to lose 'em. How to get 'em back.
The film details the marital travails of Mary Haines, played by screen great, Norma Shearer. Mary has a coterie of bitchy, gossipy, back biting friends, and included in that group is her cousin Sylvia, played with madcap zaniness by Rosalind Russell. Mary is happily married to wealthy Stephen Haines, or so she thinks. Apparently, her perfect husband is stepping out on her with perfume salesgirl, Crystal Allen, played with bad girl abandon by Joan Crawford, and it seems that all New York knows it.
Mary's so called friends ensure that Mary finds herself in a position to discover her husband's betrayal. Mary's mother, Mrs. Moorehead, played with characteristic stateliness and grace by Lucille Watson, counsels her daughter to handle the matter the old fashioned way, promising that the affair will soon burn itself out. She advises her daughter not to betray her feelings about the affair, not to mention it to her husband, not to discuss it among her friends, and to turn a blind eye to the whole matter.
Mary reluctanly tries to adhere to her mother's counsel, until a chance encounter with the now full of herself Crystal Allen causes Mary to lose control, and the fur begins to fly. Mary, now taking a more contemporary approach, totally disregards her mother's advice and refuses to overlook the affair or forgive her husband for the pain and humiliation he has caused her. Leaving him, the inevitable happens, but all's well that ends well.  The performances by this all star cast are to be lauded, as each and every one of those cast in this film contribute to making it a truly great film.
Norma Shearer is perfectly cast as the somewhat prim and proper Mary Haines. She plays her role with studied restraint, until the final shot in the film, when she crosses the line. While the fact that she was the widow of Irving Thalberg, a well respected studio head who had died about two years prior to the filming of this movie, may have contributed to her getting the lead, she certainly deserved it in her own right, as she had been a leading lady for many years (Romeo and Juliet, Marie Antoinette, The Barretts of Wimpole Street, Private Lives, etc.) and a big star. Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford were actually real life rivals and had never much liked each other, so I am sure that playing rivals in this film was not a stretch. Joan Crawford is wonderful as the ""man trap"" who steals Mary's husband. She plays the role of Crystal as a hard edged girl from the wrong side of the tracks who grabs for the brass ring. Though she does not have all that many scenes in the film, her presence is such that the viewer does not immediately realize it.
Rosalind Russell, in her first comedic role is terrific. She had  previously done only dramatic roles and actually auditioned for the role of Sylvia, playing it three different ways. She played it straight. She played it with a light comedic touch. She played it with total, over the top, comedic abandon. When George Cukor selected her for the role, he told her that the third way was the way he wanted her to play it. At first, Ms. Russell balked, thinking that such comedic excess would be the end of her career. He convinced her that madcap zaniness was the way to go, and she complied, giving an over the top, zany performance that was an instant hit. This film kicked off her start as a comedic actress.
Kudos also go to Mary Boland, as Flora, the Countess DeLave (""l'amour, l'amour""), as well as to Paulette Goddard, as Miriam Aarons, the divorcee  who steals Sylvia's husband, and to Joan Fontaine, as the sweetly naive Peggy. Ms. Fontaine looks remarkably like her estranged sister, Olivia DeHaviland, in this film. Marjorie Main plays the role of Lucy, the crude, rough, no nonsence country woman. It is a role reminiscent of a young Ma Kettle, a role she would play in the 1947 film, ""The Egg and I."" It would be a role that she would take to the bank, as it would spin off into a wildly popular series of ""Ma and Pa Kettle"" films for Universal Pictures.
Virginia Weidler is affecting as little Mary, the Haines' young daughter. Butterfly McQueen, of ""Gone With The Wind"" fame, has the small part of Lulu, the cosmetics counter maid. Keep your eye open for Hedda Hopper, the real life gossip columnist. Staying true to form, she plays the role of Dolly Dupuyster, a gossip columnist, who appears towards the very end of the film. Don't blink, or you'll miss her. The film is shot in black and white, though it has a fashion show segment that is shot entirely in color. The elegant and chic wardrobe for the cast is provided by the noted designer, Adrian.
This is a film that will be enjoyed by viewers who enjoy vintage films, as well as by those who simply love a great movie. Bravo!",1033862400,84,5414,4.579381443298969
790757,5,6304056958,"Probably the best movie comedy there is because it is absolutely One-Of-A-Kind. An all female cast in a movie about females in the Female Jungle. Hence the catch-phrase ""jungle red"" for the hot new nail color at Sydney's--the swank salon for the trendiest females--""jungle red"" is the color of blood. And the ""blood"" flies with the fur as these gals rip each other to shreds. Unbeatable cast of pros, costumes (including a color fashion show that must be seen to be believed) and George Cukor at the helm make for one-helluva good show. The DVD is first-rate from Warner Bros. But it's the ladies that provide the entertainment here. Riotous script by Anita Loos & Jane Murfin from the Broadway play by Clare Booth Luce have the girls literally bouncing off the walls with catty dialogue and sniping about everything. A MUST see for film lovers and Rosalind Russell and Crawford fans. Only Norma Shearer hits a false note as Mary the wife done wrong. Her performance is badly dated and very stylized. But actually, it just brings the film up from ""camp"" to ""high camp"" so why quibble...note the final shot to see what I mean. Hell, this must have been camp in 1939!

With an all-star cast from 1939, including Joan Crawford in an unlikely but stunning role, ""The Women"" is a treat for female viewers of all ages.  Claire Booth Luce wrote this gossipy, powder-room romp about ""l'amour, l'amour.""  Besides the escapades and heartbreaks of society women there are some great scenes in the kitchen featuring the servants, and on the Reno divorce ranch featuring Lucy, a tough old customer played by Marjorie Main.

  Depression-era audiences lapped up the scenes of New York City opulence, and the movie comes complete with some characters using the British-inflected accents that stood for wealth and class in movies from that time.

790759,5,6304056958,"This is one of the best films that I have ever seen about the emergence of modern women in 20th century America. It would work nicely as a companion piece to The Graduate. I, in fact, use both films when teaching a class on the role of women in 20th century America. The ending to the film, The Women, never ceases to amaze the young girls in the class...the idea of Mary throwing open her arms and welcoming back her wayward husband is shocking to most of the young students. It is certainly a period piece and certainly well worth viewing to see how few options were open to most women of the era. Putting everything into an historical perspective, it is difficult to believe that this was filmed less than two decades after American women were given the vote and only two decades prior to the Women's Rights movement actually kicking into high gear. It really is a wonderful depiction of women who where stuck in the middle of a changing society and how they were having to adapt and change in order to move onward.
As was noted in one of the earlier reviews, this film was made with an entirely female cast. I wouldn't swear to it, but I believe that I read somewhere that Cuckor was so obsessive about that fact that he even insisted that any of the animals who appear in the film also be female. That may have been Hollywood publicity, but it does make for fun viewing and an interesting anecdote.",1029628800,2,1403,4.420849420849421
790760,5,6304056958,"I am writing this review after recently watching a revival of the play on PBS.  Not having seen the movie in many years, I ordered it on DVD afterward.  First, the DVD transfer is flawless.  This film is mostly in black-and-white, save an insert in Technicolor for a fashion show.  The range of gray tones in these old movies can be a revelation to those who have only seen recent B/W films.  The masters of the studios in lighting these movies are long since gone, and apparently their craft went with them.  The DVD has not only the delightful movie trailer that went with ""Women"", but also the trailer for the musical remake in 1956, ""The Opposite Sex"".  I never liked the musical, but others might.
The amazing thing about ""The Women"" is that, if one doesn't pay attention to the trailer, it's possible to watch it and never realize that there are no men at all in the picture!  As the trailer says, 135 women and no men.  But of course it's all about men!
This is the basic story of Mary, played by Norma Shearer, who discovers her husband is seeing another women.  It follows her through her divorce and reunion with her husband.  Naturally it's not that cut-and-dried.  Her bitchy, back-biting friends go through many of the same travails on a cross-country route to a happy ending.  Sounds boring written here, but the movie definitely isn't.  Every time Ms. Shearer threatens to get too sugary, a few choice cracks by one of the other characters brings things back into line.
I really can't remember another movie I've seen with Norma Shearer, so this movie defines her work for me.  She is a very unusual-looking woman, hard to define as pretty, yet definitely with screen presence.  Of course, being Mrs. Thalberg didn't hurt her ability to get this part, and she plays it beautifully. All of the others who support her are equally appropriate, particularly Joan Crawford as the 'other woman'.  This movie was made in one of the low periods in her career, and once again placed her as an A-level actress.  Mary Boland also stands out as the Countess and later Mrs. Buck Winston.  In the recent PBS production on television, Rue McClanahan played this part and the resemblance to Boland was uncanny!
Wardrobe for the movie was provided by Adrian at his best.  Standouts for me are the gowns worn by Joan Crawford and Norma Shearer in the final scene of the movie, at the nightclub.  Ms. Shearer's looks almost like something from a sci-fi film!
There is no escaping that this movie, and play from which it was derived, were made pre-WW-II.  The extravagance shown in this film was never revived after the War, so this gives an insight into the lives of the wealthy.  In particular, homes post-War were never staffed with the number of servants shown here.
Art Deco never looked better in movies than it does in this one.  The beauty salon at the beginning of the movie, and the night club at the end, are creamy and curvaceous like never before, or since.
A final note on casting:  Marjorie Main leaps from the screen with her screeching voice and uncouth manners.  Strangely, she was younger than many of the others in the movie, but as usual she was made to appear frumpy and worn-out.  In some ways this appears to be a rehearsal for her part as Ma Kettle in ""The Egg and I"".  Look closely, though, and you'll see her youth, here.
This is a fairly long movie, well over two hours, but it is so enjoyable that the time isn't noticed.  There truly isn't a 'slow' part to the movie, something or someone is always on the go.
Nineteen thirty-nine was an amazing year for movies, seemingly one last pre-War gasp at screen opulence.  ""The Women"" on DVD can be a welcome addition to anyone's film library, waiting for the right evening when light comedy combined with beautiful women and sassy dialogue is called for.  It would be a great buy at twice the price.",1029628800,59,3868,4.586608442503639

Except for Norma, of course. She was the only character who made the film worth watching. This film was worth a one-time watch, but I doubt I will ever watch it again. You just need a man in a movie, in my opinion. The credits were clever in that the women were each likened to an animal that represented their personality and character.

Interesting also is the fact that despite the somewhat dated story of women of a specific social (and financial) station, much of the spirit and acerbic wit hold up very well today. Witness the debate between Norma Shearer and mom Lucile Watson about the importance of the husband (whether he cheats or not) in a woman's existence (the dialogue ""what if I don't want him under those conditions"" is especially timeless). The sets, wardrobe, dialogue, and especially the cast are all first rate.

""The Women"" is set at beauty parlors, bridge parties, fashion shows, a Nevada divorce ranch and the ladies lounge of fine restaurants.  The catty dialogue and wry commentary about men and women is truly fun to experience.
For fans of vintage fashion, this film is wonderful eye candy.  Not only are the outfits that the main actresses wear quite fun to check out, it even features a fashion show.
Crawford is wonderful as the conniving other woman, and ""The Women"" made me an instant Shearer fan.  Shearer manages to come across as a strong, self-reliant woman throughout most of the movie, despite being the wronged wife still in love with her husband.

The Women is very crisp and clear with the fashion show glowing in color more beautiful than ever.  The extras are amazing.  There are two MGM shorts that talk about the current fashions and show movie trailers from the biggest MGM movies such as The Maisy movies, The Thin Man Movies and more!  There is a soundtrack listening station that's set up with a chapter list, but instead of going to the scene, it plays the music from that scene. Now how many DVD's do that?  You own the soundtrack right on the DVD! The trailers are also beautiful, and include the even better remake of The Women called The Opposite Sex.
The work that Warner Brothers did on this film gives the other companies no excuse for bringing films out on DVD with NOTHING on them, and charging so much.  This DVD is VERY reasonably priced, and a treasure to any film buff. I hope we can see it's remake, The Opposite Sex released soon in the very same fashion.

790826,5,6304056958,"An absolute classic...  This is THE film which has eventually led me to become a devoted fan of ""old movies"".  Before that, I thought ""motion pictures"" from the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"" were boring, outdated and over-sentimental.  Then in 1986 at the age 18, I happened to catch ""The Women"" on television and realized just how wrong I was.
  From the very first scene, this movie grabs you by the throat and never lets up.  We see many women going to a beauty parlor to get all dolled-up with fluid camera-work and bitchy repartee, kicking the movie off to one hell of a start.  I have noticed that so far, every single person who has reviewed this movie has granted it five stars...  Probably one of the very few films if not the only one who was warranted such praise from every critic.  And you know what?  It doesn't even surprise me.
  The movie was directed by George Cukor, a ... director who had an illustrious career spanning five decades.  As you probably know already, he almost directed ""Gone with the wind"" in 1939 but instead, was reassigned to this movie by the studio bosses because he and ""Clark Gable"" didn't get along.  George was an amazing director and excelled at getting the best performances out of actresses, working with many female stars from that era.  But without a doubt, even though he has directed many wonderful movies, this is his ultimate achievement.
  Brilliantly directed in full high camp mode, it contains top-notch acting performances by all the actresses, even in the smallest roles.  The cast here is so strong that it couldn't have been possible to make a bad movie of out this ensemble even if they had tried.  I have watched this movies so many times now that I know almost every single line by heart but still, I often get the urge to succomb to its magic all over again, even though I have discovered this movies more than fifteen years ago.
  But everyone must agree that ""Rosalind Russell"", who plays ""Sylvia Fowler"" and became a full-fledged star with this movie, steals the show with her amazingly hilarious performance.  The first time I watched the movie, I didn't even understand what she said half the time as she throws away one joke after another, talking faster than a speeding bullet.  I had never seen an actress having such impeccable timing and she is probably the only woman in the world ever to be able to talk so fast in such a natural manner while actually making sense.
  At that point in cinema history though, Norma Shearer was without a doubt the biggest star of the cast.  The movie revolves around her character ""Mary Haines"" as the cheated wife.  You probably don't need a synopsis of the story since it was told to great length in other reviews so I will spare you.  Anyway, I am a big fan of Norma and she gives a very good performance as the noble wife.  But towards the end, she grows her claws and get some wonderful bitchy lines, getting back at her so-called ""friends"".
  Of course, I also have to mention ""Joan Crawford"" who is probably the best remembered star of the cast.  Joan was often accused of not being much of an actress but here, she simply blew me away.  True, her part is absolutely delicious and along with Rosalind's part, the most scene-stealing character you could find.  But still, she could have botched it up had she not been in the hands of such a skilled women's director, as George has often been described.
  Her telephone scene at the perfume counter along with the one in her bathroom are among the best of the movie.  But the confrontation between the cheated wife (Shearer) and the husband-stealing temptress (Crawford) which is actually the only scene where they appear together is also extremely fun to watch.  Especially if the viewer knows the fact that Crawford hated Shearer in real life, feeling jealous of the fact that Norma was married to a studio head (Irving Thalberg), which somehow granted her a special status at MGM as queen of the lot.
  But the mark of a true classic is when no line or part is a throwaway.  You can feel that George gave just as much attention to the actresses with lesser parts, making sure that everyone would give their absolute best so the great story would get its proper due.  And in my opinion, along with everyone else here, he succeeded every step of the way.
  I can not recommend this movie enough.  It belongs in your collection, even if you don't usually like old movies.  Once you watch it, you'll understand exactly why everyone is fawning over this precious gem from a lost era.",1014854400,2,4541,4.592039800995025

790870,5,6304056958,"It's still somewhat astonishing to remember that THE WOMEN was actually written by a woman, since it must be one of the most misogynistic movies ever made: though not a single man appears anywhere in the film, all the women characters do is obsess about them both in terms of the two things they can bring them (sex and money). But that aside, this movie is an awful lot of fun: it featured an almost who's who among all the best actresses on the M-G-M lot, and most of them are having a grand old time. True, there's not much fun to be had with Norma Shearer's archly noble Mary Haines, but Joan Crawford, Paulette Goddard, and particularly Rosalind Russell seem to be having the time of their lives with their over-the-top roles. Even little Virginia Weidler manages to camp it up in the great bathtub scene she has with Crawford (""And another thing, Crystal... this bathroom is perfectly ridiculous!""). The film is also endlessly quotable even down to the most throwaway lines (one of my favorites: Olga the manicurist greeting Mary by saying, ""Reading a novel, huh? How *do* those writers ever dream up those plots?"").
Best of all, everyone is gussied up in the most sublime Adrian gowns imaginable--the film even reaches its one moment of actual sublimity at the end of the famous all-color fashion show sequence, when the soigne mannequins stalk off the whirling giant test-tube rack (don't ask) while enormous chords thunder on the soundtrack. Truly a mixture of terror and awe!",977529600,5,1485,4.782101167315175
790871,5,6304056958,"I remember hearing four or five years back that a remake of the 1939 classic, ""The Women,"" was in the offing.  I don't know whatever happened to the plans for that remake, but it's hard to imagine that such a film could be made today.  It reinforces just about every negative and politically incorrect stereotype about women imaginable, up to and including Norma Shearer's final line about pride being a luxury that a woman in love can't afford.  It also includes other statements that couldn't be made today (""She thinks that because Lulu's dark he won't be able to see her"" and ""It's not her fault she wasn't born deaf and dumb"").
The film, according to its trailer, has a cast of 135 women.  I presume that they are talking about the speaking roles because there are certainly more women on screen than that.  There is not a single man to be seen anywhere; even the various animals are female.  There is one scene near the beginning where a photo of a man graces the back of a magazine cover; this shot stands out like a sore thumb each time I see it, and I wish somebody had caught it and corrected it.
Despite its political incorrectness, ""The Women"" is one of the funniest and most rib-tickling films ever made.  I've probably watched it more than any other film in my collection; I've even  taped the soundtrack and listened to it, a thoroughly satisfying way to enjoy ""The Women"" in the car, for example.
Of course the raison d'etre of this spectacular film is the bitchiness of almost all the leading characters, set off by Norma Shearer's near-saintly Mary Haines.  Such a character would be considered a crashing bore nowadays--her scene with daughter Mary, played by Virginia Weidler, gets this very fast-paced comedy off to an incredibly leaden start--and I have a hard time believing that she ever carried the full sympathy of the audience.  Even her wise old mother, delightfully played by Lucile Watson, displays more character; fumigating the room after a party attended by most of the of the other characters, she says ""How do you stand those dreadful women?""
Rosalind Russell as Sylvia Fowler gets the cattiest lines and somehow manages to be able to talk a mile a minute through the whole film, even while doing strenuous physical exercises.  Her two scenes with Joan Crawford are the high points of the film.  Joan had to fight for the relatively short but very important role of Crystal Allen, the ""terrible man-trap"" who steals Stephen Haines, Norma Shearer's husband, but her hunch paid off:  despite the brevity of her role, Crystal dominates the film from the time of her first appearance.  And even though she gets her comeuppance at the end (an element missing from the original play by the way), she leaves in triumph, looking gorgeous and with one of the best exit lines ever written.
The supporting cast doesn't have a weak link.  One standout is Paulette Goddard, the most beautiful woman in the cast and certainly one of the most spirited, as Miriam Aarons, a junior-league Crystal Allen.  Another is Mary Boland as the ditzy but generous-hearted Comtesse de Lave; even after her fifth husband Buck Winston has left her for Crystal, she still refers to the radio moguls who wouldn't give Buck a job on the radio as ""the old meanies.""  But all the leads are spectacular:  Joan Fontaine as the naive Peggy, Marjorie Main as Lucy, the proprietess of the Reno dude ranch, Phyllis Povah as Edith (largely forgotten nowadays, she was brought over from Broadway to recreate her role for the film), Florence Nash as tweed-suited Nancy the author, and the others.
One thing I have come to appreciate more with each viewing of this film is how many actresses, many of whose names I don't even know, created truly memorable characters with just a handful of lines or less.  My own particular favorite is Virginia Grey, another very beautiful woman, as Crystal's pal/nemesis Pat in the delightful telephone scene (and anybody who thinks Crawford can't act should see this scene).  But others such as Olga the manicurist, Butterfly McQueen as Lulu, and the wonderful model whose tag line is ""Our new one-piece lace foundation garment; zips up the back and no bones,"" are just three more standouts in a hugely talented supporting cast.  They prove the old adage that ""there are no small parts, just small actors.""
""The Women"" is one of those films that makes me feel especially sorry for people who claim they can't watch black-and-white films.  I'm not referring to the technicolor fashion show sequence when I say that this is certainly one of the most colorful films ever made.",977184000,7,4599,4.78030303030303
790872,5,6304056958,"What a great movie!  As the cliche goes, ""They don't make 'em like that anymore.""  And that's too bad.  The Women is at once funny, fast-paced, razorsharp, and very well-acted.  Not a single male in any of the scenes.  Norma Shearer is ok in the lead role but, as usual, Rosalind Russell and Joan Crawford steal the show.  The WAV files I have from this movie are many because the jabs are so wicked!  I only wish it was in DVD...",974592000,3,430,4.234567901234568
790873,5,6304056958,"Wow.  This movie is absolutely brilliant.
Having spent 9 of my most formative years in an all-girls school, I can attest to the beastly, fascinating manner in which women interact with each other; and this film captures it all perfectly.  The gossip!  The back-stabbing!  The use of men (who, in <The Women,> never once grace the screen) to gain power over one other!
But in case I'm making <The Women> sound like a frenzy of bitchy back-biting, let me assure you that it is written with incisive wit and acted with panache.
Buy it!  Buy it!  Buy it!",974505600,3,550,4.561224489795919
790874,5,6304056958,"""The Woman"" is one of the most amazing movies I have ever seen. For one thing there are no men here. But you don't miss them because they are the subject of the movie. The movie is adapted from a play by Clare Boothe, directed by wonderful George Cukor and has Butterfly McQueen (Ms. Scarlett, I don't know nuthin' 'bout birthin' babies), famed columnist Hedda Hopper and Hattie McDaniel in it as well Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind and others in the starring roles. Ruth Hussey plays a secretary and Virgina Grey is stunning as a store clerk. This comedy deals with issues that are never ending, cheating husbands, bitchy friends and divorce. Rosalind Russell as Norma Shearer's catty underhanded cousin is my favorite. These actresses are at their freshest and most beautiful. In the film all of the principals are wealthy, very much ""high maintenence"" and  bored so they do lunch and go to fashion shows. Although the movie is black and white the magnificent fashion sequence is in color. I saw first saw ""The Women"" on a small b/w TV, imagine my surprise years later when I saw it on a color set and they started showing the fashions. WOW! Joan Crawford has one of her best man grabbing, husband stealing roles in this movie. At one point when the husband needs to cancel their date. She becomes indignant because ""he tried to stand Joan up for his wife"". Another time in a confrontation with the wife  she says ""When Stephen doesn't like what I'm wearing, I take it off"" Are we sure this movie was made in 1939??However, all of these women are such a tight knit clique that they even go to the same divorce dude ranch in Reno (group divorce??) which is owned by Margorie Main who has no sympathy for these rich spoiled and pampered women. If you like your movies sharp, witty, fast paced and classy this is the movie for you. It's as fresh now as it was in 1939, especially when Mary (Norma Shearer) tells her mother, after she has found out that her husband is cheating on her, ""Mother, this is the 20th century. . ."" Her mother has said that Mary's father did the same thing and she kept quite, that Mary should also ""keep quiet, do nothing and say nothing.""  There are so many witty quotes that time has not tarnished that you will be tempted to use them yourself.",972172800,25,2280,4.529126213592233
790875,5,6304056958,"Some women are classy. Some women are sassy. And some women are brassy. You see them all here. One of George Cukor's finest, most polished films,  ""The Women"" runs rampant with malicious gossip, simpering  ingenues, a delectably delightful comedy. Norma Shearer plays  sophisticated, classy socialite Mary Haines, with all the essentials a  woman needs: a husband, child, white picket fence, large luxurious house...  and a brassy gossip for a best friend, Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell, in  one of the meatiest roles of her career). Recently, Sylvia has come up with  gossip of particular interest: Mary's hubby Stephen has been seen with a  sassy young ingenue, Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford at her most Joan  Crawford). While Mary is brushing her way through the rumors, gossip,  (whatever you call it) Crystal uses every ounce of allure in her 16-inch  waistline to lure the wealthy Stephen away. Can Mary's grace and principles  outshine Crystal's ... er, Crystal's... especially with Sylvia chattering a  mile a minute in the background? And although George Cukor may be known as  being ""a woman's director"", men should want to see the film too,  for in the cast of 135, all are women... that's right. Not a single man in  sight. Well, with two hours of women, comedy, women, style, and women, how  can you go wrong with this one? Trust me: you can't.",966643200,10,1358,4.964444444444444
790876,5,6304056958,"This is defintely one of the best comedies of all time. It is a classy and impressive motion picture, not like the majority of comedy films that are  made today. The film is all about the behaviour of upper class women in the  1930's. The story revolves around happily married Mary Haines (Norma  Shearer), her gossipy cousin Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell), and the  sleek and cunning Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). Using her seductive  manner, Crystal (Crawford) seduces Mary's (Shearer) husband with hopes of  eventual marriage between the two, therby securing her a wealthy lifestyle.  But Mary will do whatever it takes to get her husband back. Along the way  we are introduced to other women who are having the same problems.  Wonderful performances by the entire cast, however Crawford is the  highpoint of the film. She is an absolute steal as the bitchy, clever,  & seductive perfume saleswoman. Definitely a must-see film.",965088000,6,933,5.072368421052632

790938,5,6304056958,"I can't give this film high enough praise - the three things that make a film great to me are character actors, eccentric characters, and good dialogue, and this film has all three.  One of the things I don't understand - Norma Shearer was getting Oscar Nominations like crazy all  through the 30's for films that weren't NEARLY this good (Romeo and Juliet,  A Free Soul, Marie Antoinette) and yet the Academy passed her up on this  one (most of her nominations were given to her out of sympathy - her hubby  Irving Thalberg, who had died in 1937, was EXTREMELY well-liked in  Hollywood).  Shearer and Joan Crawford both are excellent in this film (the  scene they have in the dressing room together is pure electricity), and  Rosalind Russell's Sylvia Fowler is just spectacular . . man oh man, WHY  DIDN'T THIS WOMAN EVER WIN AN OSCAR!  (There is no such thing as a  ""bad Rosalind Russell movie."") By rights Roz should have made the  AFI list of top female actresses, I guess they think, who needs personality  when you have Marilyn Monroe . . . But the acting all around is first rate  - Mary Boland is spectacular as the Countess de Lave, Phyllis Povah plays  Edith Potter, the role she originated on Broadway, to perfection, Marjorie  Main plays what might be called a precursor to her  ""Ma Kettle""  character of the '50's, the gorgeous Paulette Goddard is outstanding, not  to mention Joan Fontaine, Lucile Watson, Virginia Wiedler, Hedda Hopper as  a gossip columnist, and a little-known actress named Florence Nash who is a  HOOT in the party scenes as Nancy, the ""old maid"" of the group  who is reminiscent of Dorothy Parker . . One more thing, if you like this  one, see ""Auntie Mame"" with Rosalind Russell and Coral Browne  (Amazon used to have it for sale, but as of now it's on moratorium -  hopefully they'll re-release it) - but if you've never seen this comedy, by  all means, treat yourself to it today.",956361600,14,1920,4.603550295857988
790939,5,6304056958,"Having played 657 performances on the New York stage and been translated into 10 languages, Clare Boothe's famed comedy, THE WOMEN was inevitably made into a movie - with considerable changes in the process. Apart from the rather unneccesary addition of the fashion show - which at once impedes the story and advertised Hollywood's bad taste in clothes (here, anyway) it remains a highly entertaining (and rather unique) film. As a narrative, THE WOMEN relates the sad case of a well-disposed and intelligent young matron (played by the 39 year-old Norma Shearer) who loses her husband to a chippy, retrieves him by resorting to the predatory tactics conventional among her friends...........As a satire, it scathingly derides the conduct of useless, metropolitan females. As social document, it reveals, with horrifying realism, the workings of such heretofore neglected 20th century phenomena as the Reno dude ranch and the deluxe beauty shop. With not one male in the whole cast, this movie is a hoot from start to finish! Norma Shearer is cast as Mary Haines, the nice woman who's husband has cheated; Rosalind Russell is a riot as the foul Sylvia Fowler, and Crawford scored a triumph as bitchy Crystal Allen, the slick shopgirl whom Stephen Haines has interest in. Paulette Goddard is a beautiful lynx and she's fun; zesty and modern in her playing. Mary Boland is a hoot as the she's always looking for ""l'amour"" (in real life she never married!) Classic line from the countess: ""Give me a bromide. And put some gin in it!"" Joan Fontaine is the essence of sweet simplicity and Marjorie Main is her usual kick as Lucy who runs the Dude Ranch (the scene in which she sings is rather obvious, loud and annoying, in my opinion) Norma Shearer, for some obscure reason, is an actress which is rarely seen on television, but her acting was quite good and she's surprisingly modern and natural in her playing. Crawford and Shearer, ironically, were rivals in real life (for plum MGM movie roles in the thirties - Crawford's once-famous crack: ""How can I compete with Norma? She sleeps with the boss!"" (referring to her husband Irving Thalberg, who died in 1937) - contained some sarcasm and perhaps bitterness - which surely added to their very effective characterisations!",946944000,9,2272,4.965879265091863
790940,5,6304056958,"""THE WOMEN"" is probably the best comedy of the  20th century! You have to watch it many times to be able to catch all the unbelievably funny lines. Every line, character, performance and production value of  this movie hits the nail right on the head each and every time. There are  so many funny scenes its impossible to choose a favorite or I would just  wind up writing out the ENTIRE script. Just a few that come to mind include  the conversation in Mary's living room before luncheon, ""On the train  for Reno,"" the Roz Russell/Joan Fontaine exercise scene, the  manicurist blabbing scene and most of all...Joan Crawford's telephone  soliloquy with ""Stephen."" This performance was proof of the  equal, if not greater, talent Crawford had compared to that of Norma  Shearer. Buy this movie. It truly is THE comedy of ALL TIME!  (""L'Amour! L'Amour!

She is at her  best in this film, exhibiting comic talents that are just as good as her  former husband's.  Joan Crawford is even good, and truly amusing.
