7979750,3,B000087F4F,"Four stories produced by Al Christie, producer of early Al Roach, Fatty Arbuckle, and Harold Lloyd comedies, contain the music of Curtis Mosby's Dixieland Blue Flowers and features Spencer Williams (""Andy"" of ""Amos and Andy""). Includes ""Framing of the Shrew,"" ""The Melancholy Dame,"" ""Oft In the Silly Night,"" and ""Music Hath Harms.""

Visualised in the middle twenties of the past century, this work is a funny comedy reflecting, probably, popular trends and fashion of a richer white majority rather than a real life of then Afro-Americans actors performed.
