157834,4,0792839072,"This is the first (and only) CINERAMA film I ever saw, without doubt the most thrilling aspect of the movie is the grand scale of the Cinerama process and the multi- channel soundtrack. The transfer to DVD is an  insult. In this era of digital technology it is easily possible to correct  the color balance errors evident in the ""seams"" of this otherwise  remarkable motion picture. I agree with other reviewers, lose the Turner  promo. The color balance, saturation, and picture
resolution are very  average, and fall well below of what the DVD process is capable. One  redeeming feature is the soundtrack. Finally, after viewing the VHS tape,  and  Laserdisc of this movie, the DVD release incorporates the correct rear  channel information of the original release. Finally, and most regrettably,  this DVD release has been cropped. Don't we buy widescreen movies to see  how they were originally shot?  HELLO HOLLYWOOD!",954028800,108,922,5.073333333333333
157835,1,0792839072,"I have never seen such a poor representation of such a great film in a DVD format.  It really sucks. The three different camera angles are so obvious and so VERY distracting, that the whole movie is painful to watch. One  scene with Gregory Peck, shows his hand about three times larger than his  head when he motions in the direction of the camera. My recommendation,  absolutely two thumbs down.  The only reason this has a one star rating, is  because the online review form will not allow none at all, and I would rate  it a -5.",939600000,12,532,4.36734693877551
157836,1,0792839072,"this movie really disappointed me when i watched it for the first time. if you are looking for a western with gun fights and bar brawls and villians and heroes, this is not for you. however,if you want a musical set in the  west then this will be your favorite movie. too long and boring and  entirely too much singing. ""walt disney goes west"" should be the  title.",933292800,2,365,4.338235294117647
157837,1,0792839072,"This one wins the ""worst presentation on DVD"" award.  They've sandwiched the ""Ted Turner"" logo in-between the overture and the main title.  You start the film, listen to the beautiful 5 minute overture,  and are then assaulted by the Turner logo (at a higher volume) before the  main titles start.  I guess we're not supposed to forget that Turner had an  integral part in the production of this classic film.  What next?  Stick to  the laserdisc -- they didn't screw it up there.",927244800,4,480,4.686746987951807

157852,3,0792839072,"Music was great. The acting was okay, though some of the actors were way too old to be playing the young people they were supposed to be, almost comical.  Mostly I was startled at how disturbing I found the assumption that the Eastern White Man's way was the only way, giving the settlers the right to destroy ways of life that had existed for centuries.  I usually can overlook such arrogance in older films--especially Westerns--but this one really bothered me.  I need to get the bad tasted out of my mouth; guess I'll re-watch Centennial, which at least presented an appreciation for the lives and customs of the Native Americans.  I will not be recommending this to my teenager and glad the rental was only $2.99.",1514678400,,718,4.674603174603175

157875,5,0792839072,"I had this movie on an old DVD which was created before the restoration they did for the blu-ray. The movie was originally created with the Cinerama technique - shot and viewed with three cameras. The DVD had terrible join lines, and was sometimes blurry because of the process. I saw the movie in the theater (yes, I'm that old) and have always liked the content, so I recently watched the DVD. I have been impressed with the restoration they have been doing on old movies (It Happened One Night, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington, You Can't Take It With You, to name a few, and no I didn't see these in a theater,,, I'm not that old!) After viewing this DVD, I thought, ""What a good movie to restore"". When I checked on-line I was happily surprised that they had, and there was a blu-ray of the restored version. When I received it, I sat down and watched it again. Now I could concentrate on the content more than the quality of the recording. The movie is chock-full of stars, and tells about the Westward expansion in the US over many years. Historically, it's not as accurate as we know to be true today, but considering it was produced in the early 60's that's not surprising. The production was good, the acting was good, and it's well worth the view.",1500768000,4,1254,4.432900432900433
157876,5,0792839072,"I saw this movie many times in it's initial release at the Seattle Cinerama and again when they restored it and re-released it in LA at the dome.
This is the best presentation I have ever seen. Through the use of computers they have eliminated 90% of the giggle and mismatch between the three panels that make up the full picture. If you have never seen it at the theater you will not appreciate just how good this Blu-ray release is.
This is the complete ""road show"" version with Entrance/Intermission/Exit music.

157879,4,0792839072,"You get to see just how many really good actors and actresses were around in the 1950's and 1960's. There is no unifying star to this film, though Debbie Reynolds comes close, and some big names have fairly brief roles. Truly excellent are Jimmy Stewart, Karl Malden, Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Robert Preston, Agnes Moorhead, Carol Baker, Gregory Peck, George Peppard. John Wayne has a very brief appearance as General William T. Sherman at the Battle of Shiloh, but he completely nails it. These fine actors put a lot of life into a movie that has no central plot but a lot of adventure and great cinematography. This film will seem old fashioned to some but give it a shot and just enjoy how good these various stars actually were.",1498694400,6,733,4.603053435114504

157900,4,0792839072,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this classic western...

How The West Was Won (1962) features an all-star cast and is quite entertaining throughout.  The movie is pretty family-friendly, though it is violent in many parts.  There are some aspects of the movie that I don't care for, such as the family-friendliness feel and atmosphere (which the musical score accentuates much of the time) and a few hokey scenes, but the action in many parts of the movie makes up for these things.  This movie really has its moments at times.  Lots of excellent camera shots during the action scenes.  The movie has great scenery throughout.  The Blu Ray picture quality and sound are both excellent as well.  The movie looks as if it was released yesterday.

Some of the cast includes: Carroll Baker, Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda, Carolyn Jones, Karl Malden, Gregory Peck, George Peppard, Robert Preston, Debbie Reynolds, Jimmy Stewart, Eli Wallach, John Wayne, Richard Widmark and Russ Tamblyn.  Plus many others.

157926,4,0792839072,"I first saw this movie in a theater, not first run on the gigantic Cinerama screen but in a neighborhood theater with a normal sound system. To be honest I was bored and the constant repetition of the musical theme drove me crazy.  I was younger then and less traveled than I am now.

Since then Ive traveled the Southwest extensively including an old-time train trip to locations where the movie was actually filmed. I was motivated to buy a Blu-Ray copy after Debbie Reynold died because a friend who had worked with her told me she put in a good performance in the movie.

Watching it now on a HD wide-format TV with a 7.1 surround sound system at home was actually better than seeing it in the theater  and I don't say that often. The colors are crisp and vibrant, the sound is crystal clear and the much-discussed three-panel join lines were only visible a few times in the course of the movie and I probably would have overlooked them if I wasn't aware they existed.

This review is not to rate the movie itself, it is what it is and it must be remembered that it was filmed in a different era. Nothing I say will change what already has been said.  I am commenting on the DVD product itself here and I found it to be well worth purchasing. Movie westerns, because they are already period pieces, tend to stand the test of time and don't seem as dated as some other genres. Because of the beautiful restoration and audio improvements it was as good looking on my TV as anything filmed today.

157939,3,0792839072,"THE GOOD: The main reason a film buff should watch this movie is for the use of the triple Cinerama camera and Ultra-Panavision 70. While the flaws of the camera system are present during nearly the entire film, that is a large part of it's charm. Not only can you clearly see the three film strips during the entire movie (yes, even on the cleaned up blu ray) but the wide angle of three cameras causes many shots to look unnatural by creating sharp curves in the set or causing the actors faces to expand and warp. This will cause some people to consider the film unwatchable, but for me it's the only reason to watch it. This is a piece of film history and is a lesson on why the 3 strip Cinerama system failed entirely. Another great thing about this movie is that nearly every scene is filmed on location at some gorgeous places in america. When the camera is still, the Cinerama is pretty damn breath taking (although ultra-panavision is better).

The most impressive scene in the movie is the buffalo stampede. It is just phenomenal and awe inspiring. At first I chuckled that the opening credits thank (North? South?) Dakota for allowing them to film this scene. This amused me because these thanks are usually at the end of a movie but after seeing the sequence, they definitely deserve top billing!

THE BAD: The casting in this film is terrible and it suffers from the same problems that most American westerns have. Unrealistic characters, whitewashed events, overly sentimental morals and it's just too clean. About 1/8 of the actors are attempting an accent and the rest are making little to no effort. John Wayne has a small role and delivers his lines just as awkward and bad as always, Gregory Peck is charming but out of place as is Debbie Renolds but the grand-daddy of all bad roles is.... Jimmy Stewart as a Mountain Man... Yup. Clean shaven bumbly Jimmy Stewart plays a rough rider and it is absolutely awful but also extremely entertaining. There is even a scene later in the film where one of the characters reminisces on Jimmy and does an impression of him! However we do get to see a small role from Lee Van Cleef, arguably the best actor in the movie.

Some cinerama issues that aren't as charming is the placement of the actors in many shots. Most conversations between two people feature the actors placed directly in the center of the camera right next to each other.. This is obviously because of the difficulty of cinerama, but after awhile the framing of dialogue scenes gets extremely redundant. There are also some really bad rear projection effects in the film. It looks like they used 16mm film or really rough 35mm in the background and this clashes horribly with the beautiful ultra-panavision shots. The river sequence is very hard to get into because of this constant back and forth cutting of crappy rear projection and brilliant 70mm film shots.

The film also has a lot of standard sexism and racism that the 50's and 60's were saturated with. During the first battle with the Indians absolutely no white men are seen dying in battle. The voice over claims that mountain men were ""more Indian than the Indians"". There is no mention of slavery or black people except for a bartender in blackface (yeah, they wouldn't even cast a black man in a non speaking role). The railroad scenes feature no Chinese, Jewish or Black actors (you know, the people who mainly built our railroads). Women are seen as always desiring a man and even the progressive women in the movie end up getting married because... it was made in the 60's. Every conversation between two women is about men and their means to achieve marriage.

THE UGLY: Now racism, sexism and white power is usually always present in classic movies. Our society was even more oppressive back in the day and cinema nearly always reflects this in a negative way that suggest that it wasn't a problem. If you are going to watch old movies you have to be prepared to see casually offensive themes left and right but it rarely ruins an entire movie for me. Some film makers can use racism to paint their characters and others use it to push hateful views on the audience. At first, I applauded this movie for acknowledging the mass genocide of Native Americans, people stealing land and goods from others and the truth that white settlers were more dangerous and backstabbing than Native Americans. However the film ends with various shots of modern city views and tries to justify that white men murdering, stealing and deceiving was a necessity to create the world we live in. Not only is this a logical fallacy, but the most important event that lead to colonization of cities in the West is prostitution, brothels and the boom-towns that stemmed from pioneer women. No prostitutes, no modern American cities in the West and there is absolutely no segment on that. The terrible crimes committed in the name of white imperialism, government, capitalism and ownership are inexcusable and rather than acknowledge and accepting how terrible it was, the film tries to distract you. When you show footage of terrible deeds of the past and then close with modern shots and a direct voice over to the audience about the world they live in, it is no longer standard 60's whitewashing, it is blatant propaganda. It's like the film makers realized they just made a movie about awful protagonist doing horrendous things to others and needed to end on a happy note. I would have given the film 4 stars if not for this major flaw that sadly, many 'Muricans have bought in to.",1483574400,2,5555,4.6875

I am very satisfied with the quality of the disc; while not up to the standards of the new releases it does a fantastic job of recovering the drama planned for the original Cinerama release.

The movie itself is entertaining and held our interest all the way through. The John Wayne part is very short and of little consequence in the movie; I would have to say the focus is on Debbie Reynolds who does a very decent job in the part assigned to her. Second to her the role played by George Peppard served as a focal point for the second part of the movie. Other notable actors contribute varying parts to the telling of the story.

157974,4,0792839072,"Released in 1962-63 and written by James Webb, How the West was Won is an epic Hollywood Western covering fifty years between 1839-1889 focusing on the Prescott familys move West and narrated by Spencer Tracy. This is a history lesson amped up with melodrama, romance, adventure, violence and song & dance.

The film was done in Cinerama, which was a short-lived cinematic experiment involving three synchronized projectors and a huge curved screen. Only one other film utilized this process, ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm,"" released the same year. Cinerama was invented so film could keep ahead of its growing rival, television, but it proved too expensive and cumbersome. Despite this, How the West was Won was a huge success at the box office.

There were epic Westerns before and after, of course (1958s The Big Country, 1960s The Alamo, 1990s Dances with Wolves and 1994s Wyatt Earp). What separates How the West was Won is that its split into five vignettes directed by three different directors, as follows:

THE RIVERS (1839), directed by Henry Hathaway. This opening segment may turn off viewers with its eye-rolling Disney Goes West vibe and the corresponding corny dialogue, particularly the lightning fast romance that starts between Linus Rawlings (James Stewart) and Eve Prescott (Carroll Baker). But, if you can endure past such cringe-worthy moments, theres a sudden shift when the travelers run into a malevolent gang of river pirates (Walter Brennan, Lee Van Cleef and cutie Brigid Bazlen). The switch from quaint Disney-esque family-friendly material to nigh shocking violence is notable. One villain gets an ax wung into his back (!). The episode ends with a thrilling fatal rafting sequence. Karl Malden plays the patriarch while Debbie Reynolds plays the less-romantic sister. I must say that the producers knocked it out of the ballpark by featuring Baker, Reynolds and Bazlen in the female department; all three are breathtaking.

THE PLAINS (1851), directed by Henry Hathaway. Lilith Prescott (Reynolds) ends up in St. Louis as a dance hall performer where she learns shes inherited a gold mine in California. A handsome gambler (Gregory Peck) catches wind and tags along on the wagon train, led by the great Robert Preston. Both guys want the babe, but only the latter seems sincere, which curiously doesnt interest Lilith. This segment is highlighted by Reynolds beauty and her entertaining song & dance sequences and a thrilling Cheyanne attack on the wagon train.

THE CIVIL WAR (1861-1865), directed by John Ford. This segment starts at the Prescott homestead in Ohio where the son of Lilith, Zeb (George Peppard), decides to join the Civil War, after his dad did a couple of years earlier. This is the weakest of the vignettes because the scenes where Ulysses Grant (Harry Morgan) and General Sherman (John Wayne) hang out are obviously studio bound and, worse, the Shiloh battle sequence is almost non-existence. What a letdown!

THE RAILROAD (1868), directed by George Mashall. After the war Lieutenant Zeb gets a gig in the U.S. Cavalry, trying to maintain peace with the Indians while befriending grizzled buffalo hunter Jethro Stuart (Henry Fonda), but Zeb becomes disillusioned when an arrogant railroad mogul (Richard Widmark) violates treaties with the Arapaho by building in their territories. The Natives retaliate by stampeding bison through the railroad camp and killing many. Its an impressive sequence.

THE OUTLAWS (1889) directed by Henry Hathaway. Widowed, Lilith moves from San Francisco to her remaining asset, an Arizona ranch, inviting Zeb (Peppard) and his wife (Carolyn Jones) & kids to oversee it. But Marshal Zeb is threatened by a vengeful outlaw (Eli Wallach). Instead of waiting for the thug to strike, Zeb goes on the offensive with the help of reluctant Marshal Lou Ramsey (Lee J. Cobb). They hide out on a train with an unusually large gold shipment to ambush the outlaw and his gang. The exciting climax is impressive for its time and obviously influential in action-oriented cinema.

As you can see, the movie isn't built around characters or a unifying plot, but rather a series of thinly-connected stories with a few characters carrying over to other segments (Baker, Reynolds, Peck, Peppard). Its a big film rather than a great one. But you have to respect its uniqueness and the fact that it pulls out all the stops to entertain on so many levels. The score by Alfred Newman, for instance, is one of the all-time best film compositions. While the movie sometimes disappointsparticularly the opening Disney goes West vibe and the truncated Civil War sequencetheres just too much good here to give it a bad grade. You just have to be willing to acclimate to its quirks and uniqueness. Needless to say, don't expect a conventional Western because How the West was Won is anything but.

The film runs 164 minutes and was shot in Kentucky & Illinois in the East; and South Dakota, Utah, Arizona, California and Oregon in the West .

157999,5,0792839072,"Originally released in 1962, ""How The West Was Won"" was passed from ship-to-ship in the U,S, Navy Pacific Fleet during the period 1966-68; the ship I was aboard as a member of the crew couldn't seem to get away from this flick.  Our ship received it during at-sea replenishment so often that we actually began running it backwards just to make it seem different.

Seriously though, re-mastered for sound and High Definition, the special effects in ""How The West Was Won"" come alive; rivaling those found in  more recent movies making this over 50 year old offering relevant to today's audiences.

Younger members of audiences will most likely not recognize many of the actors and actresses appearing in this movie.  Most passed on long ago; however, their appearance is a reminder of what the ""Golden Age of Hollywood"" was all about.  The acting and scrip may not be the best ever produced for the ""Big Screen"" but it is thoroughly entertaining throughout.

Surprisingly, considering the movie was made for theater-only viewing long before movies were made movies for a quick trip to DVD or BlueRay after brief time in theaters. ""How The West Was Won"" translates nicely to home theater application, particularly if one has surround sound to fully
appreciate the special effects.

Is it a great movie?  For many today, probably not.  Is it an important movie?  Definitely yes!  Is it worth just under three hours of your time?  It certainly is - while long, it is a very fast-paced adventure well worth renting or buying (if for no other reason than running it backwards just for fun).",1464393600,18,1584,4.843866171003717
158000,5,0792839072,"The Smilebox version captures the essence of the original Cinerama process, as far as the original roadshow presentation goes.

158004,1,0792839072,"The old adage of too many cooks spoil the broth is so very true for this movie.  Three directors, three different approaches to presenting the story.  Little if any consistency in direction of the actors, scene selection or photographic technique.  The first two parts of the story are so over acted I thought this must be rehearsals.  Fine actors with a lousy script and poor direction make this almost unbearable.

Secondly the Cinerama method of filming does not transfer well to the DVD format.  As others have mentioned there are lines separating the three camera segments.... sometimes very obvious and distracting.  Color balance and the effect of time on the prints are obvious as well.

Third, mismatched parts.  Jimmy Stewart being seduced by Carol Baker in the first part of the story?  He's suppose to be a lot older than the girl and Karl Malden in his best Amish outrage wants to find out if she has been compromised by him.  George Peppard doesn't look old enough to be a young teenager vs his mom and certainly not old enough to be in the Civil War.  John Wayne as General Sherman?  Harry Morgan as General Grant?  If cigar smoking has an Academy Award they would have won - throw away parts.

Maybe in the 1950's or early 60's this was a great technological and acting feat - today its not worth the time or the effort.",1464134400,,1336,4.601694915254237

158046,3,0792839072,"The plotting of this movie was rather hokey, and almost more suitable for children. I also noticed a few historical inaccuracies. (Oxen were most commonly used to pull covered wagons, but none are shown in the movie. And I am not aware that wagon trains tried to outrun mounted Indians, circling the wagons being a more feasible option. Also, I am pretty sure there are no rapids on the lower Ohio River.)

If you consider the West to be the part of the country west of the Mississippi River, the first parts of the movie are not even set there. The Civil War battle shown was in Tennessee, even though some important battles did take place west of the Mississippi. The best things about the movie are some good music, and glorious scenery.",1448064000,,740,4.56390977443609

Other than that visual insult, the events depicted contain a few grains of historical reality, which are thoroughly overwhelmed by patently untrue and unbelievable Hollyweird fantasy.  How The West Was Won is about as believable as Broadway musicals such as Brigadoon, Finnians Rainbow, South Pacific, Oklahoma and Lil Abner.

158053,4,0792839072,The movie is an average western with big stars in small roles and none of them distinguish themselves: it is difficult to do so in such a long convoluted story. This would not merit the four stars I have given. That is for the cinematography; the sweeping camera work and the background of mountains and rivers that are the life and soul of this movie. The smile technology of whatever that has been used to simulate the original Cinerama technique is the real winner. I alternated between the wide screen HD version and the Cinerama version and the latter wins hands down. It is good to have both in the package. No one actor has really scored significantly; the scene of marauding buffaloes is fantastic and one can watch it again and again and marvel.,1445472000,,754,4.592592592592593

158065,5,0792839072,"Its not clear from spme other reviews that the 2-disc Blu-ray version of HTWWW (and the 3-disc DVD version) includes two fine extras: the 97-minute long Cinerama Adventure documentary which reveals the history and technology of the Cinema process, with lots of clips, technology information, and background stories about the unique process.  This is definitely worth a watch, particularly for those of us who got to see Cinerama in the original 3-projector form.

The other extra is the audio commentary, probably the best Ive heard in any DVD or Blu-Ray, ranking right up there with Eberts commentary on Citizen Kane.  The director of the above-mentioned Cinerama Adventure, David Strohmaier, film writer Rudy Behlmer, film musician John Burlingame, and renowned stuntman Loren Janes (not James as in some other reviews).  The commentary is full of information and is never dull, which is quite a statement for a long film.  Shooting locations are discussed in detail, as are funny stories about actors experiences on set.  You can tell that the comments are edited to fit the film content, so you don't get a lot of the rambling chit-chat of other DVDs where the speakers are talking about something completely unrelated to whats on the screen.  As in the documentary, this is well worth a listen.

158072,4,0792839072,"A cracking good movie with a strong central performance by Debbie Reynolds.  While it may not be historically balanced, it's a grand way to spend a few hours.  Much of the movie is told from a female perspective as an unusually authoritative Debbie Reynolds crosses the continent over much of the movie, finding time for some rollicking songs and dances and some good guy/bad guy romances with Gregory Peck and Robert Preston.  Thelma Ritter is very amusing as Reynolds' wagon train companion and the cast as a whole is glittering and solid.

158082,5,0792839072,"(Full disclosure: this review is based on viewing on TCM in high definition. It is apparently the new restoration) It's not perfect, but it's about as good as is possible, showing on a flat screen. The hi-def quality is excellent, but there are the limitations inherent in the 3-camera ""surround"" video process of Cinerama. It was meant to be shown on special curved, arced screen to give a surround effect. This was the first feature film to use the Cinerama process (previously limited to travelogues!), and it was followed by versions of 2001: A Space Odyssey and a handful of others. I first saw it in my home town, where there was no Cinerama theater available. So we sat and watched 3 split screens, with the right and the left appearing, on a flat movie screen, at odd angles, making for a bizarre experience. I loved the film, but was disappointed in the way that I, and probably the vast majority of viewers, saw it.
This new edition virtually removes the lines separating the edges between cameras, but not entirely. If you look close, you see a slight, almost invisible blurr where the pictures meet. But the angle problem remains, since we have to see it on a relatively flat tv screen (even the new slightly curved models won't help appreciably). Bodies distort slightly as they pass between segments (not very often, though, and usually unobtrusively), and depth perspective is exaggerated ( a train traveling across from side to side will appear to bend toward the viewer at the center and bend away at the end of view, kind of like looking through a fisheye lens). Also, people on one end looking at people on the other end of the view will appear slightly as though they are actually looking beyond them!
All of that in mind, this is certainly a monumental job of restoring the film, and made it look like a normal widescreen picture (actually ultra-widescreen at 2.89:1 dimension!). It was enjoyable to watch, and the few limitations I mentioned detract little from the overall viewing experience. I felt I was actually able to really see it for the first time.
In regards to the movie itself, it is sort of a serious ""History of White People in America."" Filmed in 1962, it was the story of one family's settling of the West over a period of 50 years, encompassing the Ohio River period, the Civil War, and the Indian wars. With all the patriotic music like Shenandoah, Battle Hymn of the Republic, and When Johnny Comes Marching Home for background, you get the idea of the subject being the conquering of the continent and its ""primitive peoples"" to quote narrator Spencer Tracy. It is a paeon to the brave pioneers who settled the West, but it also lightly describes the criminals, rogues and moguls who exploited it. Overall its a hymn to ""manifest destiny,"" an antiquated idea popular in the 19th century and into the 20th, of America's destiny of stretching ""from sea to shining sea.""
It is truly an ""all-star"" cast of the top cinema actors of the 1950s and 1960s: James Stewart, Debbie Reynolds, John Wayne, Robert Preston, Richard Widmark, George Peppard, Harry Morgan, etc., etc., with three directors including John Ford. This is a true Western classic, and it is a revelation in this restoration.",1436572800,2,3226,4.75222816399287

158094,5,0792839072,"Louis L'Amour  authored ""How the West was Won"". I love everything he writes. His stores really come to life for me. He writes with great detail. I can see a desert sunset when he describes it.  When I read How the West Was Won I remembered the movie from my youth so I wanted to see if the movie and the book matched. I wanted to see a L'Amour story come to life.  Indeed the book and the movie match  and perfectly in every detail. In fact the movie actually is enhanced more than the book by its music score. If you are a Louis L'Amour fan then you should give this movie a try. The cast is awesome John Wayne had really a very small part. Debbie Reynolds however was the best as Lily. There are so may great actors. This is the best true to book movie I have ever seen.  It played like a stage play with an opening orchestration and intermissions. I thought wow this would be a great movie for a get together with friends that enjoy westerns!",1433548800,,945,4.14207650273224

158172,4,0792839072,"Good rent for $3.00.  For those looking for the answer to whether the streaming version is in Cinerama, the answer is, nope.  If you are looking for the incredible experience of seeing this film in full-on Cinerama, widescreen goodness, you will have to buy the Blu-Ray version.  The streaming version has none of the eye-popping hugeness that the original has and as a consequence you will miss a great deal of what makes this movie so special.  It appears to be just the center strip and/or some variation of pan and scan.  Having said that, there are no seam lines in the streaming version or any other kind of visual distractions and none of the important action is missing or offscreen.

Given that the viewer is missing a lot of the visual impact of the film, the movie proves to be a good movie all on its own. Made in 1962, it shows the mature, elegant craftsmanship of the day: well-crafted characters and scenes, full story arcs, and beautiful cinematography and editing.  It's the sort of film never made any more.  A special word has to be said about the stunt work, which is just spectacular:  the raft down the rapids, the attack on the wagon train, the buffalo stampede, and the final train shootout, all have masterful stunt work on them, done when there was no CGI to create things that weren't there.",1426204800,3,1318,4.598290598290598

I was a bit hesitant to purchase this edition, as I did not know how the three Cinerama camera images could be stitched together to form a cohesive seamless picture.  Well, one view of the opening scene and my apprehensions were put to rest.  Yes, there is a slight seam that can be seen at various times, but it is hardly noticeable, and it certainly does not detract from the viewing of this fine western classic.  The visuals are exceptionally sharp and clear, and the sound is crisp and vibrant.  This is a magnificent transfer to blu-ray!  And for a film that was intended to be the epic western of all-time, no film deserves better treatment.  The cast is awesome, and they all are tremendous in their roles.  Debbie Reynolds is gorgeous and at her vibrant best!  The buffalo stampede sequence is stunning.  The final sequences between George Peppard and Eli Wallach are breathtaking.  Three directors, and all-star cast, and three academy awards; this is a film experience that one never forgets.  Watch it on the largest flat screen or curved screen HD tv possible for maximal effect.  Any western movie fan will require this film in their collection.  Absolutely magnificent.

158214,5,0792839072,"I have always loved American history, and have loved this movie. This blue-ray edition is an excellent transfer of the original three cameras version of the film. There are only a few places during this presentation that the old three camera melding was obviously visible. Most of the time the remastering is done flawlessly. Of course the whole story could have taken many, many hours in the tradition of the Ken Burns style documentary (some day I hope so), but this dramatization keeps a steady pace of the unstoppable Westward movement of civilization to it's ultimate end at the California gold fields. It is a reverent record of a family migrating from the East to the wilderness of the West (Ohio and later beyond). The film ends with a nod to the modern inhabitants of the American West with the cloverleaf highways of the early 1960's Los Angeles and San Fransisco, as a way of connecting viewers to the generations past who sacrificed to bring us to where we are today, the Promised Land of America. There is a good mixture of old Folk songs of the early days into the soundtrack such as Shenandoah, The Erie Canal, and many others. The final segment gives recognition to the horrible fate given to the American Indians by the powers that be, This is a blight on American history as great, or greater than the evil of human slavery that was ended in the terribly bloody Civil War. From Mountain Men, to prospectors, to homesteaders, this drama touches on several moments in the story of America. Not perfect, but a wonderful classic.",1419379200,,1543,4.718518518518518

158226,5,0792839072,"This movie was nominated for 8 and won 3 Academy Awards,including Best Picture in 1962. It was also a top box-office winner. It is both a Western and a History covering the experiences of several people during the opening of the West from the years 1830 to 1880. It had 3 different Directors who directed different parts and a bevy of big name actors. There are many scenes that are magnificent from a spellbinding raft ride through river rapids,an Indian initiated buffalo stampede through a railroad construction site,battle scenes of the Civil War,train robbery and wreckage,saloon dancing scenes,gunfights,and that is only a few of them. There is a great music score involving numerous period ballads. The camera work is spellbinding with fantastic landscape scenes all across the western part of America.
 The storyline is also excellent as the movie follows people across the country and several actors actually play their parts as they age over a period of 50 years.
It was a major task to attempt to take all the fantasticthings that took place during the 50 years that the West went from a frontier of lawlessness,struggle,hope, failure, sorrow,determination and all the things it took for the people to build up the West.,and to do it all in a movie of 164 minutes with a storyline that mesmerizes the viewer from beginning to end.",1416528000,,1341,4.96

The scenery is beautiful; the story large with each story line tied up [think of a James Michner novel--you care about the characters]; the musical score is one of the best film scores ever; and the acting, except maybe for the Civil War sequence that is a bit corny, is top notch.

I have always loved this beautiful,epic,all-star casted,slightly romanticized tale of American Westward expansion. Over the years,I have seen numerous television broadcasts & home video versions,but most have been appallingly cropped,& have had such terrible joining & matching of the three Cinerama film segments,that they were all but unwatchable! This presentation,is actually quite excellent! While no home video of HTWWW can ever reproduce a Cinerama theater,they have done a top-notch job restoring  the film & joining & balancing the segments. Color saturation & contrast are great & the overall effect is often breathtaking. Sound is very good,but is not the original discreet format shown in theaters. The movie is presented in the charming traditional format,with the overture & intermission intact.

COMPARED TO BLU-RAYS OF MODERN MOVIES: The treble sounds a bit boosted, and can be strident.  There is a little break-up and distortion in the highs.  The bass is attenuated, therefore the soundtrack is out of balance.  I'm certainly not complaining about the relatively little bass in the sound effects, but the weak bass in the MUSIC.
COMPARED TO THE ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK SENT TO CINERAMA THEATERS: The Blu-ray is much less dynamic, and poorly balanced.
Modern movies sound great on my system, better than in most theaters.  The HTWWW BD may be another example of the generally poor handling of the great sound in movies of the magnetic era when they are transferred to disks.",1410912000,3,698,4.840336134453781

158263,5,0792839072,"""How the West was Won"" has always been one of my favorite movies. It consists of an anthology of stories that loosely follow a family and their descendants as they leave the farm in New York for the wide open spaces of the American West. The ensemble cast, with many cameos by top stars like John Wayne, is eye catching, and the cinematography is eye popping. The Cinerama three camera filming method was revolutionary, and this was one of the early (and few) feature length films made with that process.

If you've watched this movie on TV, you've no doubt noticed the vertical stripes which demark the interface between the images produced by each of the three cameras. I was used to seeing those lines throughout the length of the film. Here, they are only apparent in brightly lit outdoor vistas. For most of the film, the image on this blu ray is seamless, and that is a substantial and welcome difference from the showings I've been used to.

We also enjoyed the special features on this blu ray, especially the feature length documentary about the creation and early history of the Cinerama process.

158289,5,0792839072,"Before watching this movie I read Louis L'Amour's book ""How the West Was Won"". At the time I didn't know he wrote it as a novelization of the movie which was based on a script by someone else (James Webb, I think). I loved the book and was so happy to see the movie was just like it, in many cases word for word. There were a few scenes in the book that weren't in the movie, but it was still really enjoyable.

To Parents:

There were a couple of scenes that made me cringe - an ax in the back and a guy flying into a cactus. Both scenes were brief and free of gore (blood); just thought I'd mention it if you plan on watching this with kids. Otherwise I found it very clean and family-friendly.",1397520000,6,696,4.036231884057971
158290,3,0792839072,"I liked the movie for several reasons. Besides all the well-known actors who played smallish parts, there was Carroll Baker. I recently read a book that she wrote in the 1960's and thought she was a special person - perceptive, sensitive, intelligent, besides being a remarkable natural beauty, though not as celebrated as other Hollywood celebrities. I found I liked her character in the movie - a woman of integrity and boldness and courage - which I had not remarked on the previous time I watched the movie many years ago. I also remembered much of the story as told by Louis L'Amour, and even some of the dialog, e.g. by James Stewart, was taken directly from the book. I appreciated that the movie was unashamedly patriotic as I personally do not think my fellow Americans are the ultimate or best people in history - there are other, worthy people living meaningful lives, struggling and coping, doing the best they can, in the rest of the world outside of America. Yet Americans are right to be proud of the tremendous achievement it was to ""Win the West"", through hardships and suffering and courage. And, as the movie briefly points out, there was tragedy visited upon some: the native Indians, the Chinese immigrants, the buffalo. This was all part of the magnificent story.
The frustrating part was that the quality of this movie - as an Instant Video, rental, to me in Thailand, was not consistent. There was a break, about 3/4 of the way through, when the movie got lost. I stopped and re-loaded, AND DOWNLOADED again and after some time it came back.
I have had this problem before with some, but not all, Instant videos. I don't know if the problem lies with Amazon or my Wifi or my computer.",1397174400,,1708,4.658940397350993

158306,5,0792839072,"This was one of what I like to call the super movies of the late fifties through early sixties.  These movies (albeit a little pretentiously) had an overture at the beginning and an intermission in the middle.  They also were crammed with as many stars as would fit on the wide screen.  And wide it was.  I have read that the quest for wider and wider aspect ratios in the fiftes and sixties was the movies studios reaction to the popularity of television.  To survive they felt they needed to provide and more immersive experience than could be gotten from watching a TV.  This film is one of two that I know of, maybe there are more, that were shoot in Cinerama.  This process involved using three cameras simultaneously and then combing the three images.  Previous releases of this film were either cropped beyond recognition or the borders of the three images w\ere more than a little noticeable.  This edition finally give you the full Cinerama aspect ration with no image lines.  \
For its time this was an amazing achievement.  Think about three huge move cameras mounted on a raft shooting the rapids.  The cast is huge as befits a movie purporting to be a history of the settling of the American west through the entire 19th century.  The performances are patching some really good some not.  The film is broken up into several different sections with  Debbie Reynolds character being the unifying thread.  I believe each section had a different director. Bottom line this movie is an epic by any definition.",1392768000,2,1517,4.7110266159695815

Granted our history of western culture really only lasted about 60 years, this movie however did a very good job of covering that time frame.. Of all the stars who acted in this film are to best of my knowledge gone, only two or three are still are with us. This movies has been re mastered the color is vibrant. The nasty lines dividing the screen in thirds for most part have been removed. The movie is so clear now, it doesn't take a person long when watching it to find yourself in the middle of the Ohio river, racing down the rapids or prospecting for gold in 1848. Then on to the traveling west with a wagon train. We see a glimpse of the Civil War and the Hell known as Shiloh and a man who entered the war as a boy returns home as a man. The expansion and taming of the west is then covered. The final part covers the bandits and a very accurately done train wreck. I worked for the railroad for years and when a train wreck happens you just go with the flow and ride it out. The staging of this sequence was very well done. This is a movie that should be in every ones Library. I have owned this movie for years, I just bought this one only because it has been re mastered. If you haven't seen this movie you will enjoy it. By todays standards it might not hold up to the computer graphics they are using now, but there is one thing you can say about this film, it is one that the whole family can watch and enjoy together.",1392681600,2,1538,4.0625

158310,3,0792839072,"This could have been a great movie. Shot in Cinerama but digitally corrected to conceal the fields over which the three films were screened. The blue line  revealing each separate film is well concealed in most of the film, There are those shots which come up a smile effects, for example a railway track that takes and abrupt 90degree turn. But all of this is acceptable. What ""wrecks"" this movie is the deplorable inclusion of Debbie Reynolds who is determined to make a musical out of a saga.
Doris Day's ""Calamity Jane"" is a musical western and enjoyable because it sets out to be just that.
Why in the name of all that is otherwise good in this saga of the old west did the producers and directors employ Debbie Reynolds. The dance hall and bar room scenes could have been portrayed in a much more adult fashion with actresses of far greater talent.

158334,2,0792839072,"This movie is a marvel of technology and complexity in the making but the actual plots are incredible and the viewing experience on a TV is weird. As a story it is badly flawed. Probably it was desperate last attempt to entice more people back to the theaters as the  movie studios so feared TV, the production added a couple of dozen top stars to the super expensive Cinerama process. In the theater, Cinerama is spectacular; on the flat screen if has a strange prospective, such as a scene where the wagons seem to be traveling in half circles.  The ""smile"" process that attempts to simulate the curved screen does not look as good as the flat screen version.  Don't waste your money on buying the book packaging with the ""smile"" disc.
The best part of this movie is the music and Debbie Reynolds singing. The plots of the separate stories are terrible and some of the setups laughable; examples: After going through rapids and loosing a raft a surviving daughter decides to homestead this section of the river as a steamboat is shown in the background going up the broad, flat stream. Then there is a shot of three men in an settler's wagon shooting at Native Americans--the wagon, supposed to hold all the worldly family goods, is bare. In the outlaw story the hero is supposed to be a federal marshall and in at least one shot is wearing his badge, but the local sheriff, his friend not only tries to run him out of town but to disarm him with the excuse that the marshall is ""making trouble;"" I couldn't believe this story line.
I didn't see any Blacks in the movie and there may have been a 1 second shot of someone wearing a coolie hat at the gold claim to represent the Chinese--this was a whites only depiction of our history.

158357,5,0792839072,"How the West was Won is an epic movie with an all star cast of actors as well as directors that shows the winning of the west by Americans.

The story starts in the late 1830s-the flag shown in the River Pirate's lair has 26 stars thus the start is sometime around 1837.  The story ends in the late 1880s.

Central to the story are the lives and loves of two sisters, Eve and Lilith Prescott. Both women seek their husbands and their fortunes in the wilderness, and in the process they and their families become essential to taming the west.  Eve's son in particular goes on to fight in the Civil War, protect the railroad until Gilded Age business ethics become too much for him, and then carve out a niche for himself and his family in Arizona Territory.

In many ways the movie is beyond the normal Western genre of White Hats and Black Hats.  It is a profoundly deep history lesson with riveting, witty, and truthful dialogue.

What makes this movie so moving, so forward and beyond other westerns is the music of Alfred Newman (1901-1970.)  Indeed Newman is quite possibly one of the greatest composers ever to have graced Hollywood.  His music has the touch of King David and his Lyre.  Each note of the musical score is perfect.  The music is in every way expressive, running across all the  emotions of humanity in its struggle on this Earth.

158369,5,0792839072,"I had seen this film when it was first released, in the modified Cinerama format.
Over the years I had seen it again on TVs and DVDs.
My recollections were that it was long, with great scenery, boring at times and the more memorable
action sequence was the fight on the top of the train in the latter portion of the film.
Last night I watched it again, in the Special SmileBox Process Transfer Replicating the Cinerama Wraparound Format.
It was almost like watching a small scaled Cinerama!
In this wide screen format, this film put on one of the best Western scenery on films, despite some remaining dirt on the film stock.
As the film goes, the first part before the Intermission was great.
It tells a family of parents, two sisters and one brother went west.
One girl fell for a mountain man/trapper.  The other for a gambler.
With this as the primary story backbone, we are taken on a journey of blue skies, white clouds, wild rivers, snow capped mountains, trees, riverboats,
native Indians, wagon trains and iron horses.
It seems the first part was directed by Henry Hathaway who did a brilliant job.
After the Intermission, the story starts to make a downward turn.
The Civil War part was brief, directed by John Ford.  Not very impressive.
The second part of the film was about building the railroad, town sheriffs and robbers.
George Peppard as the aging son of one of the sisters and the retired sheriff struggled to carry the film.
The climax sequence of robbing the train is no longer as thrilling as the previous viewings.
Overall a well told and mounted account of, How The West Was Won, with an all star cast.",1371859200,2,1624,4.596551724137931
158370,5,0792839072,"I've seen this movie several times on television over the years, but I can't recall ever seeing it on the Big Screen, and certainly not in its original Cinerama format. It's a great film though . . .

There are essentially five acts or interlocking stories based on western themes, bound together via the saga of a pioneer family through three generations. The storylines are realistic, the actors familiar and wonderful (even in 'minor' roles), and the action sequences especially well crafted. If the drama is a bit uneven at times, well . . . maybe so was life. Though essentially reassigned from an acting role at the last moment, Spencer Tracy ties everything together nicely through his comfortable narration.

'How The West Was Won' was filmed using a three-camera process designed for projection onto a giant 146 degree curved screen in order to increase depth perception and audience inclusiveness to presentation. Film from the three cameras was formatted and synchronized into aligned panels, which worked spectacularly well when viewed as intended. The aspect ratio therefore was very wide--2.55:1.  Cinerama was the rage of the 1950s and into the early 60s. The Dimension 150 craze of the late 60s and into the 70s was a pale imitation of the true three-camera process; so sorry, 2001 fans.

Because of design parameters and the necessary curved screen, the film has never translated adequately to television. By cutting to center (older model televisions), many very important visual elements to either end of the original were often not seen, though you can often hear the dialogue and other goings-on otherwise. And for years you could see the joined camera segments as major distortions.

The three-disc special edition is a significantly improved version of this great classic. The film (two discs) has been cleaned up, removing much of more blatantly translated panel lines, in addition to the washout and blurring that's been incurred since the advent of VHS. Even so, be aware that when presented on a flat screen--especially the large monitors we have available to us today--you will still perceive the images as being sometimes `wonky.' Even knowing these limitations, one can enjoy the history of it all plus the end-product.

The original seven-channel (!) stereophonic sound has been re-mixed and formatted to Dolby 5.1; it's really quite beautifully done. The 1997 reissue of the soundtrack is readily available today.

The third disc is a comprehensive documentary of the development of Cinerama from its origins to the more familiar 70mm wide-screen films.

How The West Was Won is one of those bits of classic film that should be on any Western aficionado's video shelf.

Nevertheless if you are a move historian or just love the movie business, you must have this version of How the West Was Won in your collection.",1368921600,,778,4.4822695035460995
158380,5,0792839072,"I've been a fan of 'How the West Was Won' since I first saw it 30+ years ago.  Up to now, the only way to see it was either on TV or VHS tape. No matter how much you wanted to enjoy the views and large scale action, the pictures were given short shrift by the method of filming used: Cinerama.  To get most of the action on screen, the studio used multi-cameras simultaneously. BUT! The process left two very visible vertical lines 1/3 of the distance from the film edges. Very noticible and very distracting!
I am EXTREMELY happy that they were able to almost totally eliminate these annoyances in the DVD copy here. Now, instead of the lines taking center screen, the story, sound, color and landscapes have their rightful spots.
When I popped the first DVD in to play, I was astounded! The color and clarity! It was like watching an entirely different feature.
The story itself follows a pioneer family called the Prescotts from their trek through the Erie Canal and westward to new lands. Along the way, mountain men, river pirates, gamblers, indians, stampedes and death have an big influence on their lives, but not on their spirit or desires to make a new life and home in the west.
The generations of Prescotts and their off-shoots,the Rawlins & Van Valens survive to demonstrate another look at the settling of the west.

It does get a little long though for people who aren't used to sitting through longer movies since today's are much shorter.  I don't know why it's  introduced above as How the West was Won (John Wayne)  He had a very miniscule part.  The story centered around a pioneer family going West, and their saga.  John Wayne's character was a General (?) in the civil war, which really wasn't even a quarter of the movie.  Be that as it may, he is in the movie, and if that's the draw, be prepared to be disappointed.

It provides a glimpse at what was entailed in the 'conquest' of the West. Yes, a bit romanticized and very tame, but nevertheless. You can fill in the blanks.
The views are so incredibly breath-taking and the cinematography is masterful. Just for that reason alone, it's worth watching. It's incredibly long but thanks to a strategically placed intermission and a certain lack of suspense ;-), it's ideal to watch over the course of 2 evenings. Enjoy!",1362441600,,703,4.770491803278689
158394,5,0792839072,"I bought ""This Is Cinerama"", ""Windjammer"" and ""How The West Was Won"" together from Amazon for a weekend of Cinerama viewing.  All of these movies were awe inspiring in the Smilebox format on BluRay disc.  But ""HTWWW"" was the most breathtaking.  The cinematography is overwhelming with sceens of the best locations of America.  The deserts, the rivers, the old towns.... are beautiful and awesome to take in.

The 3 camera angles across the Smilebox screen is as realistic as it can get without actually seeing it in a real Cinerama theater.  The 3 camera angles adds a quality of depth and perspective that no other widescreen format can come close to showing.  Then adding the Smilebox format just enhances that depth so much more.  This BluRay Package comes with both the flat 70mm widescreen version, and the Smilebox version on separate BluRay discs.  You get to directly compare both versions.  The flat 70mm WS version is very good and shows off the depth and color very nicely.  But the Smilebox version has no competition for awesomeness.

The restoration of this movie makes the Hi-Def picture really shine with clarity, color and contrast that equals movies made today in HD.  They also stayed true to the unique 7 channel effect of the sound.  Your ears can follow your eyes as the sounds seem to move across the screen with the objects and people making the sounds.  The 7 separate soundtracks was also digitally restored and rivals the quality of todays movie soundtracks in both quality and placement of the Dolby TrueHD 7.1 surround sound speakers.

My own dream is that movie companies of today would start releasing their recent films in a Cinerama or Smilebox presentation for the theater and home screens.  I enjoyed the Cinerama effect so much, I decided to do a tribute to this wonderful movie format that rocked the world.  My tribute can be seen on my website at k3dav.com

This is a must see movie for any fan of the western movies and especially for Cinerama fans.  It is worth buying at any price.  It just doesn't get any better than this.  Hollywood forgot how to make movies with this quality.",1362355200,5,2122,4.756164383561644

158397,5,0792839072,"Of all the releases this movie has had on home video, the latest blu-ray release is the one that The Warner Brothers studio has finally got right. It has been fully restored to full clarity 1080P HD with no artifacts or distortion of any kind and 98% of the film has been digitally fixed so the joint lines from the three strips of the cinerama version are vertially undetectable in this movie. In earlier home video releases the left and right parts of the screen were left the way the film was shot causing the characters to suddenly look stretched out a tiny bit due to the cinerama version being shown on a flat screen and not curved like it was in theaters originally. But Warner Brothers studio took and curved the end of the screen upward and then took and made the film straight all the way across so the film looks like it was filmed with only one camera and not three. So now the film looks the way it is supposed to for a flat screen. And the three parts of the film have been carefully restored so they all match up in quality. This is the best version of this film to date. It truly does look like something Warner Brothers spend millions even billions of dollars to restore. And I have never an old film like this look so breathtaking in it's restoration than this blu-ray version. The only other film that looks as good in it's restoration is BEN HUR. This is the way all classic movies should look when restored properly. My hat goes off to Warner Bros. for their wonderful restoration!

It's true, we don't use three lens cameras, but all movies released these days are shot in widescreen and made with stereophonic sound - both of these innovations can be traced back to 1952 and the release of the first Cinerama film. The documentary is detailed, well-made, and includes some surprising, exciting moments.

I teach Film History, and after showing excerpts of this documentary in class today, my students were all very excited for the next Cinerama screening in Hollywood. (There are only three theaters left on earth which can project this kind of movie, and we are lucky enough to live right down the street from one of them!)

*How the West Was Won* is a grand, star-studded movie which is well worth watching in its own right. The fact that it's an artifact of the moment when Cinerama was the Cadillac of movie exhibition formats makes this boxed set doubly worthwhile.",1357603200,,1237,4.775700934579439

158420,2,0792839072,"I remember seeing this film when it was first released many years ago.  At that time I found it extremely boring; but then there was a great cast with the likes of James Stewart, Carol Baker (known back in the day), Debbie Reynolds, Henry Fonda (very small part), Karl Malden, even the great Agnus Moorhead, and others.  I remembered that but forgot just why I thought it boring.  I have matured considerably since that time so thought I would give it another go.

Same thing only more so.  Now I know why.  This is a film which could have been a great epic; but it is disjointed and at times hard to follow.  Lots of action sometimes and slow as molassas others.  It lacks much in historical flavor as some do today with inserted folk and other songs done by Debbie Reynolds.  You believe  she was great in Vegas but in this epic..no way.  And the romances seem to dominate compared to any vestige of authenticity. Very Hollywoodish!

Jimmy Stewart was hardly believeable as the mountain man turned  farmer for the love of a much younger Carol Baker.  Probably the best player was George Peppard as their son who ages to become a sheriff married to Carolyn Jones. And Robert Preston stands out (as he always did) but is extremely miscast as the wannabee husband of Debbie Reynolds.  Obviously though he was inhibited in this tale by some very bad dialogue with Reynolds. Gregory Peck, the gambler who showing no effort wins the heart of Reynolds, mainly plays Gregory Peck and that not very well.

And a pop corn role for Raymond Massey as Abe Lincoln in a scene really not necessary.  All was easily forgotten and all will again be such.  John Ford directed the Civil War sequence which, of course, meant John Wayne had a small part in that (as General Sherman) but what was it he said?

158422,5,0792839072,"HOW THE WEST WAS WON is a good movie; however, it and the 2008 blu-ray restoration have some big mistakes.  First of all, let me say that the blu-ray version is very beautiful, with rich color. I particularly like the smilebox presentation on disk two.  A problem in the restoration does spoil the early part of the movie, in the section dealing with the river.  The scenes where the Prescott family and the Scottish family are camped along the river at night were filmed as day for night.  When the movie came out in 1962, these scenes were darkened to appear as night.  So when Linus (James Stewart) comes along, the families wonder about what kind of man travels the river after dark.  On the blu-ray it looks like broad daylight.  Otherwise I find no fault with the blu-ray.  It's great!

The movie has a fine script with many of the best actors of the times.  But there are a bunch of geographic goofs:  1. The rapids depicted early in the movie looks nothing like the historical Falls of the Ohio River.  The real Ohio River ran through deciduous forests.  The rapids in the movie is obviously on a river in the mountainous west, with coniferous forests.  2. Not even 100 miles out from Independence, Missouri, the wagon train is passing in front of towering Rocky Mountain peaks.  We know this because Gregory Peck's character arrives after 100 miles.  The Rockies are hundreds of miles from Independence.  3. The wagon train heads out with the leaves turning autumn colors.  It would have left in spring, to make it across the mountains by winter.  4. The colored leaves are seen throughout the trip to California.  Such a wagon train could never cover that distance in that short of time.

I do wish film-makers would be a little more careful with details.  (I also know that there were considerations of budget and time.)  The truth is I like this movie a lot and can't praise the musical score and songs enough.  Buy it with the second smilebox disc. ( Just once I had to sound-off about the inaccuracies in a movie.

1.) Buy a big screen TV.

3.) Watch the Smile Box version.
4.) Be amazed.",1337472000,3,316,4.19672131147541
158430,4,0792839072,"This is a big movie, full of stars. It follows the story of one family primarily, with Debbie Reynolds playing the central character, Gregory Peck her lover and/or husband. But most of Hollywood got into this act: Carrol Baker, Lee J. Cobb, Henry Fonda, Karl Malden, George Peppard, James Stewart, Eli Wallach, John Wayne, and a host of other favorites, such as Andy Devine and Henry Morgan, who incongruously plays U.S. Grant.

Starting with the Erie Canal, much of the story is the transportation methods used to get west, and most of the rest is fighting Indians and outlaws. There are mountain men, river pirates, shooting white-water rapids on a home-made raft (not intentionally; they took the wrong fork of the river), St. Louis, of course. A major segment involves a wagon train westward, but there are gold miners, civil war scenes, railroad builders, buffalo hunters, San Francisco mansions, Arizona red rocks, and a thrilling train robbery finale. This movie has it all, including Debbie Reynolds singing and dancing in some pretty tough houses in some pretty scanty costumes.

The music is grand, the scenery and costumes are well done, and with all those stars, you'd think it would be a huge hit. Well, it was. But there's only so much you can put into a single movie, even a rather long one (155 minutes). Stories follow stories without too much continuity, people grow old suddenly, and you can't help thinking it's a pretty history lesson and not a great deal of story.",1337385600,,1486,4.869565217391305
158431,5,0792839072,"One of my all-time favorites, with a terrific all-star cast, this film covers in a broad sweep the final three-quarters of the nineteenth century in America starting with the era of the Erie Canal. Some may complain that big names have short screen times, but that's what makes it all the more fun watching it throughout.  Debbie Reynolds appears in four of the five segments, which is probably the most of all the actors, but brief screen times for great actors is the norm throughout the film. For example, at the beginning we see Jimmy Stewart, Karl Malden, Agnes Moorehead, Debbie Reynolds, Carroll Baker, Tudor Owen, then Lee Van Cleef, Walter Brennan, and Brigid Bazlen in the first segments, but only one of these is seen beyond the intermission.  Throughout the movie, you can try to spot brief appearances by others such as Ken Curtis, Harry Dean Stanton, Raymond Massey, and Barry Livingston.

As others have stated, this movie was shot in Cinerama format (with three cameras) that required special viewing in Cinerama theaters with curved screens and properly oriented triple projectors.  It was an experimental/novelty format, much like IMAX is today, and most of the films shot in Cinerama format were intended simply to promote the format - which is why the extremely ambitious ""How the West Was Won"" is particularly noteworthy. The only other full-length, supposedly Cinerama film with a large all-star cast was ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World,"" a comedy that also was meant to promote the Cinerama theater experience even though it was shot in Ultra Panavision (single-camera). Nevertheless, it was another memorable film.

Beyond the acting and directing rosters (""How the West Was Won"" has five sections directed by three famous directors - Ford, Hathaway, and Marshall), and the amazing imagery, however, is perhaps one of the most beautiful movie scores ever written.  This was Alfred Newman's crowning work and, besides having his own rousing and recurring theme motifs throughout, he weaves numerous American folk melodies into the score in ways that modern film composers would do well to emulate.  It is a musical masterpiece that can easily stand on its own without the movie.  The Civil War sequence, for one, has a poignant foreshadowing moment that combines ""The Battle Hymn of the Republic"" with ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home Again"" that still puts a lump in my throat.

This is a long movie, and, in accord with common practice of the day, includes an intermission (in which people usually got up and went out to the lobby to get more snacks, etc.)  Newman's score offers some interesting mood music for this intermission, but, again as part of the promotion of Cinerama theaters which were among the first to feature state-of-the-art sound systems, he also wrote substantial prelude music that was designed to aurally set the mood for theater patrons as they waited for the movie to start.  Having been fortunate to attend the golden Cooper Cinerama Theater in Minnesota back in the day to see this movie four different times(!) in 1962-63, I can tell you the effect was magical.

I've included this movie on my Listmania list of movies worth watching again and again for young and old.

Side note: If you watch this movie on anything but Smilebox format, you'll notice that some scenes look very strange, and I'm not talking about the vertical lines that defined the seams between the three cameras.  For example, when Zeb travels up to the high country to see Jethro, the intended Cinerama theater screen showed Zeb on the left third of the screen and Jethro on the right third, and because the screen curved so much, the effect was that they looked like they were actually facing each other across the stage.  When this is seen on a flat screen, however, it just looks confusing.  Please don't fault the film for these flaws but try to see it on a big screen in Smilebox format.  It's not the same as the original Cinerama experience, but it's the closest thing to it I've seen to date on a flat screen, and the difference will be obvious.",1337126400,7,4077,4.868497109826589

158436,4,0792839072,"I saw this movie in Cinerama when it was first released. I was in one of the front rows. I ducked when the Civil War artillery shells were fired on my right and landed on my left! It was an amazing experience.

While Cinerama was an amazing experience, the photographer in me recognized the short comings of the process - the obvious seams between the three projected images; different color values for the images at the joints; optical distortion between frames.

Hats off to the producers of the Blu-Ray version (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/How-the-West-Was-Won-Blu-Ray-Book-Packaging/dp/B0018O50VQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">How the West Was Won (Blu-Ray Book Packaging)</a>. They went back to the original film strips and made digital copies of all three films and stitched the resulting images together digitally for the Blu-Ray release. The result is ALMOST flawless. You can find the seams, if you look, but they don't hinder the majesty of the on-screen image.

Disc 1 is a shadow box version with almost a 3:1 aspect ratio - leaves a pretty wide shadow box on a 16:9 screen. Disc 1 also includes a 1+ hour documentary on the Cinerama process, including clips from other Cinerama productions. Here you can relive a touch of the theatrical experience and see how bad the seams really were! It also explains why HTWWW was the last true Cinerama production.

Disc 2 has a ""smilebox"" version attempting to recreate the wrap around big screen experience. It fills a 16:9 screen with an image that expands to the top and bottom of the screen at the edges and necks down to the same size as the shadow box version in the center. Interesting, but, without a TV that is 8 or 9 feet tall, that dog just won't hunt! And, one of the best parts of Cinerama was the impact of your peripheral vision - won't translate to a flat screen, no matter what you do.

My opinion is ditch the second disc and enjoy the spectacle of this 50 year old masterpiece of cinematography and musicology. The story is lame, just enough plot to string together almost 3 hours of visual and aural extravaganza.

I've always had a crush on Debbie Reynolds. In this movie, in her late 20s, she starts out portraying the unmarried daughter, who is 20 - a catastrophe in that era. The era-correct costuming does a fine job of showing off her figure! 'nuff said!",1329523200,3,2371,4.9002493765586035

The movie is beautiful and the sound is very clear. Even though it's 5.1, most of the sound is from the center so it almost feels like the original mono. That's good because I almost always hate simulated 5.1 on old movies.

I found the Smilebox version unique and interesting, but it was very distracting on moving/panning shots. You can see where the cameras overlap on scenes with blue skies (there are plenty of them) but it's not horribly annoying. I find myself so involved in the story that I soon forget about it.

The Cinerama shooting method does cause a few optic issues: People on opposite sides of the screen don't seem to actually be looking at each other and just walking a few steps away from the camera seems to move them far into the distance. Minor exposure differences might bother you a bit (it did me), but it's no deal breaker.

The letterbox format has its own issues, but these can't be helped when playing what was meant to be seen on a giant curved screen on a small flat screen. The bigger your TV, the better you'll enjoy this movie.

They did an OK job blending the seams caused by the three camera overlap. The annoying seams show up in several places. Usually in the blue sky. If only they had spent a little longer... The entire film is shot with a super wide angle lens. There are no closeups.
This film is extraordinarily corny and wholesome. There are several musical numbers that add little to the plot. John Wayne is hopelessly miscast as George Tecumseh Sherman. He should have been given a more important part. Duke is only on screen for a minute. He was after all, the king of the American western. The movie would have been better if John Ford had directed the entire thing.
With all that, there are several spectacular moments...... the buffalo stampede, white water rafting, the insane out of control train sequence and the stunning wide angle vistas of some of the most beautiful country in the world.

158455,5,0792839072,"Wide screen movies (for that matter, widescreen TV) owe their existence to Cinerama, an odd format that premiered in 1952. The high def film process required three cameras for filming and three projectors for exhibition on a deeply curved screen. It was a cumbersome, unwieldy method of moviemaking more appropriate for travelogues in the 1950s. Hollywood struggled with the process when they made two narrative films using the system. HOW THE WEST WAS WON was the better of the two. For years it was poorly served when shown on conventional television. The standard 4x3 aspect ratio and diminished resolution couldn't begin to showcase the power of a movie that once sparkled on 96 foot screens with surround sound and gut-wrenching visuals. Along comes BluRay technology with its superior resolution and sound reproduction, and Cinerama finally gets a chance to demonstrate why it was so revolutionary in post World War 2 moviemaking. This version of the movie has a second disc that offers a new letterbox version called Smilebox. The film is presented in the same curvature that moviegoers experienced in the early 1960s, when they were engulfed by the enormous curved screen. New computer technology is put to even better use with the virtual elimination of the once-visible lines that separated the three panels.

158460,5,0792839072,"What can you say about a movie which was one of the most outstanding in the history of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer films, and probably the greatest for CINERAMA? It can easily speak for itself. It excludes no one; it is enjoyable for people of all ages and types, be they history teachers or people who like just ""good ole westerns"" that in the late 50's were popular, especially in small towns, on Saturday afternoons; this 1962 production did remind me of my ""favorite western"" days. (I definitely did fit in the latter category.) For people who like love stories, there was also some warm romance.
One of the most outstanding casts in the history of Hollywood was found in this one, to state it mildly. Karl Malden (as Zebulun Prescott) and Agnes Morehead made a ""perfect pair"" as the sodbuster and his wife. Lillith Prescott (excellently done by Debbie Reynolds) and Cleve van Valen (the role of the tinhorn which suited Gregory Peck picture-perfectly) made a lovely couple. James Stewart did a good job at being the mountain man, the part of the marshall, (done my Lee J. Cobb), was a job that required virtually no acting for the experienced veteran actor, and George Peppard was versatile as Zebulun Rawlings, a farm-boy-turned-soldier and later a tough, determined, unrelenting lawman himself. Robert Preston, the ex-""music man"", was a high-spirited wagon master. From seeing Harry Morgan as General Grant, I can easily see how the Union general appeared during the time of the War Between the States; the same can be said of John Wayne in his role as General John Tecumseh Sherman. You were pushed to hate Mike King (played by Richard Widmark,) the egotistical, unbearable man who would not let anything-not even a buffalo stampede-impede him from having a railroad built. And you also wanted to see killed the desperado Charlie Gant.(That role was just right for Eli Wallach.) Again, the cast was outstanding.
The scenery was beautiful, all the way from the Ohio River to the Sierras; the deserts of California and Arizona were also scenic.
Each of the five stories in the movie spoke for itself. I personally would like to have seen it win the Best Picture
Award of 1963. It should have been, as it was, recommended by the NEA. (I am speaking as a former teacher myself.) I saw it for the first time as a high school senior in March of 1964, and only a few years ago bought the video for it; I have watched it many times, and have not become bored from doing so.

However, all is forgiven with this latest release. The 'blu-ray' edition is nothing short of stunning, both visually and aurally.
The joins of the 3 strip process have been all but removed, with the often slightly different saturation levels of the backgrounds similarly blended to appear as one, correctly color balanced,
giant frame. One thing overlooked by others is the geometric errors introduced by the 3 camera process have been carefully corrected (the final scene of the 'fly under' of the Golden Gate bridge was 3 distinct straight lines joined as one.

The previously missing correct rear channel information is all there.
The only minor critique, as one other has pointed out, is the really obvious opening scene 'ball of fluff' which was obviously on the cinerama lenses. Could have been easily fixed.
If you have a good projector, and good audio, you simply won't believe the picture detail and giant 'scope' of this movie. The plot is dreadful, some of the acting a bit wooden.

What I watched instead was a little disappointing because it was marred by a few glitches. The first is that the projection of the movie clearly was done with three panels, all of which are very clear throughout the whole movie. The second, the script was very, very slow at points. It just did not move fast enough to capture the entire spirit of the west. Anyway, its worth watching, and I would give it a four. However, I might be judging it harshly because I expected too much.

158467,5,0792839072,"Why there are two separate reveiw I don't know - but look to the other set of reviews for ""How the West was Won"".  The other set accurately tells you about the DVD and the BLU-RAY versions of this great American film.

How the West was Won, is a story of our move to expand across this continent in the 1800's.  There are thrilling scenes, raftings down the Ohio River, Buffalo Stampedes, and Coal Fired Steam locomotives, all set to glorious music, music taken from folk songs through classical composers, the best that America had to offer.

And the stars, there are plenty of them in this movie.  Hollywood's finest at the time it was filmed; among them Debbie Reynolds, Jimmy Stewart, and even John Wayne.

The film is rich in history telling the tale of two sides of a family, one that stayed in Ohio, and one that ventured west to San Fransico.  Along the way the story of America is told through their eyes.  When this film was done, it was filmed in Cinerama, a three camera process that enveloped the viewer in the film.  I was fortunate to see this film and one other, The Tales of the Brother's Grimm, the only two Cinerama Films ever made, in all their glory, in CINERAMA, and I can tell you that it was indeed spectacular.  I felt that I was in the picture!  I saw it as a child, and when the buffalo scene was enfolding on the screen, I remember ducking as the buffalo stormed over and across the screens around me; it was that thrilling!

Too bad that didn't continue with the process, but I think it was too expensive to make, and not many theaters could accomodate three projectors projecting onto three separate screens simultaneously.  But I tell you, that to see it live, in person was absolutely awesome.  I wish they could revive it so people today can experience it for themselves.  The beauty of the film, together with it's awe inspiring music made such a thrilling combination, that at the time when I saw it, I was most proud to be an American!

Now, I did buy the regular DVD version of this film and I can tell you that though the sound was good, the film itself was a mess.  Projector lines were in place and it made the film horrible to watch.  But, from what I've been reading on this site and others, the Blu-Ray vesion is wonderful - Warner Brother's took their time and restored the film in all it's glory - they got rid of all the projector lines, so you can't see them, all you see is the SMILE Version of the film - a type of Widescreen to show that full view of the Cinerama Version.  It's all that they could do to have it restored accurately for us viewers at home.  For you must remember, that Cinerama was a CURVED SCREEN - you sat in the middle of it - and were enveloped by the film.  So the only way they can show it is with this ""Smile"".

So, today, I'm going to order it, and patiently await for it to arrive.  When I get it, I'll load it into my Blu-Ray player, sit back and watch it on my 60"" Sony DLP HD Television.  I expect to be amazed, but I am aware of the limitations of the process.  Still, I know it will be much better than the DVD version - that version was a piece of Buffalo Dung.",1280448000,6,3143,4.250841750841751

I have seen the 3-panel presentation in Cinerama equipped cinemas on three continents. It never fails to impress. Perhaps, as one critic (I forget who) remarked about the film, 'the parts are better than the sum', the reason for this would have to be the fact that several directors worked on it. John Ford, who loathed the Cinerama format even more than CinemaScope, oddly enough, was inspired to direct the most memorable scenes in the film. For him, the Civil War was a broad canvass; a theatre-in-the-round, if you will. Ford elicits memorable performances from Carol Baker, George Peppard and Claude Johnson in his film debut. I should also mention Alfred Newman's stirring music score, the cinematography, sound recording, and editing.

158479,5,0792839072,"First of all, this is an excellent movie for the visual grandeur of the West.  The story (or should I say stories?) is/are OK, but Debbie Reynolds is the glue that holds the segments together;  she was only 30 years old when this movie was released.  OK, so I like Debbie Reynolds;  shoot me.  Excellent, moving music as well.

Second, when I upgraded to a Blu-ray player, I planned to sell my DVDs as each corresponding Blu-ray disc was released.  When I viewed this Blu-ray release, I decided to keep the old DVD release, just for the stunning comparison.  I first saw this movie in the Cinerama dome in L.A. in 1962, but DVD releases have never done it justice;  the extra-wide three-screen rendition on a non-HD TV lacked resolution (an inherent problem with widescreen movies on 4:3 TVs, and even more so with this movie).

Well, this release contains two screen renditions of the movie.  The first disc is a traditional widescreen version, with MUCH IMPROVED resolution, as you would expect of an HD movie on an HDTV.

The second disc is in what is called ""Smilebox"" format, where the left-right screens of the Cinerama three-screen view are stretched vertically in such a way as to simulate the Cinerama effect (amazingly, straight lines are preserved!).  Rather than being a gimmick, it is an unexpectedly good effect, best experienced sitting CLOSE to the TV screen (ignore your mother; an LCD screen won't sterilize you if you sit close to it).  Whether you like the effect is personal, and if you don't, you always have the first disc.

If you like epic westerns with good music, this is the release that will make you glad you upgraded to Blu-ray.",1267920000,3,1659,4.711805555555555
158480,5,0792839072,"This is an excellent buy for anyone who was a fan of How The West Was Won.  The commentary is great as the commentators tell you about each of the actors, their accomplishments, and even the actors that didn't receive any recognition in the movie such as Lee Van Cleve who gained stardom in the spaghetti westerns of the '70s.  One of the commentators is one of the stunt men that tells of how many takes and hours it took for each episode.  He was the principle stunt man through the whole movie.  My only wish is that I had seen the movie in Cinerama when those theaters were still around.

158482,4,0792839072,"Having greatly enjoyed the original Cinerama presentation of How the West Was Won as a teenager, I can testify that this Blu-ray restoration comes close to re-creating the spectacle of the full Cinerama experience.  2.89 is a really wide aspect ratio, wider than any other Blu-ray disk that I know.  2001 Space odyssey was also produced in Cinerama, but its Blu-ray has only 2.2:1 aspect ratio.

To get the full wide-screen effect with this aspect ratio, you need to sit much closer to the screen than normal.  For me, sitting back about 2/3 of the screen width is about right - no more than 30"" for a 46"" diagonal set.  There are two complete Blu-ray disks in this package, one in rectangular format and the other in ""Smilebox"" format to simulate the original curved screen.  I am not too sure which I prefer, but I am glad they provided both.  Sitting close is important for both versions.  Just before the Indians attack the wagon train, the wagon-master spots them on the far ridge.  You have to be VERY close to the screen to see what he sees.

As other reviewers have remarked, they have done an excellent restoration with the color and removal of most of the artifacts at the seams between the 3 cameras.  As the accompanying booklet relates, the outdoor locations were carefully selected for their beauty and freedom from marks of modern civilization.

The soundtrack in TrueHD format also delivers the full excitement of the stunning score by Alfred Newman and Ken Darby.  Surround is used to full effect in the music, less so in the action, but the explosions in the civil war battle are very effective and directional.

From the cast list in the book, I realized that the oddly familiar actor effectively playing General Grant is Harry Morgan, Jack Webb's sidekick in Dragnet.

  Right away you will notice the film has three creases in it.  Look at it long enough and it looks like a folded postcard.
 The lines mean the film was so big that it fit a three-screen CinemaScope theatre.
  Turner Classic Movies and this DVD release present this film in Wide-Screen format so all three-screens can be seen.

  This is a good 'ole American Western Epic filmed in South Dakota. You might spot the Devil's Tower.
  The film starts with Mountain Man, Linus Rawlings (Jimmy Stewart) trying to make it to Pittsburgh.  Along the way in a canoe, he comes across he Prescott family (Karl Malden, Agnes Moorehead, Debbie Reynolds, Carroll Baker) and they quickly like each other. Linus hasn't been with a good women in a long time. She got a kiss out of him, but the next day he left.  Destiny will bring them together again.
 After dealing with some bad guys at a trading outpost, he was pushed into a pit and escaped back into the water now floating on a log. He caught up with the Prescott family and helped them be rid of the bad guys at the outpost. Linus decides he must go his way and godspeed to Eve.
  After the Prescott family goes through the terrible river rapids on their raft, Linus received word of the family and finds them downstream.  He continuously thought of Eve. He asks her to go to Pittsburgh with him, but now she believes God put her family there and that is where the farm should be. Will she go with him?
  Suddenly the other daughter, Lily, has her prayers answered. She does see a paddle steamboat. We assume she did make it to the boat as the film takes us on the long journey of her life.

158485,4,0792839072,"This portrayal of different stages in the settling of America's interior includes a mixture of acting-reenactment and documentary. It begins with the period after the Revolutionary War, when even places such as St. Louis were considered far west, and ends with the modern urban-industrial complexes that characterize the USA coast to coast.

There is a re-enactment of a battle during the Civil War. John Wayne has a brief appearance as General Sherman.

The settling of the west shows both the peaceful and non-peaceful aspects of the same. We see the stagecoaches, the telegraphs, the Pony Express, the first trains, etc. Unfortunately, no scene is shown of the Golden Spike being driven in to connect the first west-to-east and east-to-west railroad into a single USA-spanning railroad.

The American West was characterized by gold rushes, farmers vs. ranchers, the buffalo drives, and much more. The Indians are portrayed not so much as persecuted as victims of a changing society that many of them could not adapt to. Gone forever were the wide-open spaces conducive to a nomadic lifestyle. Treaties with them were broken less out of deliberate dishonesty as changing economic circumstances that prevented their fulfillment.

How the West Was Won was a high-concept, star-studded, old-time epic composed of five different segments designed to showcase the three-strip Cinerama process and viewed today it's little more than a curio: the lack of continuity between the segments and the fact that the best two come first unfortunately make this distinct but overlong picture more fitting to be the answer to trivia questions than as Friday night's entertainment.

158488,5,0792839072,"When high-quality, low-speed Kodachrome slide film became available many years ago, that product was a justification for photographers to invest in the best 35-mm. cameras available, such as Leica.  Kodachrome film shot with a Leica camera became a reference.

The TV western classic of the late 1950's and 1960's, ""Bonanza"", with its wonderful color photography, provided many an American family with justification to invest in the emerging technology of color television.  ""Bonanza"" was the reference TV show that displayed what color televisions of the time could do.

""How the West was Won"", a contemporary along with ""Bonanza"", went to great lengths to show how beautiful the American West was, using the three-camera process of Cinerama to demonstrate to the public this cutting-edge method of cinematography.  Today, Cinerama still remains the best process ever invented to film a Hollywood epic, surpassing even that of IMAX.  It is too bad that it was a cumbersome and expensive process to work with, and did not meet with the full approval of the three directors involved with the filming of HTWWW.  But what visual magnificence is evident in this film!  Thank goodness that Time-Warner went back to the original Eastman negative and developed technology to eliminate or minimize the disconcerting film joins of the three Cinerama projectors in transferring this classic to DVD and Blu-Ray.  The results of their efforts are evident, and based on the other Blu-Ray movies I have and have seen, HTWWW can justifiably be considered as a Blu-Ray reference!

Other reviewers critical of the ""Smilebox"" process transferring HTWWW onto a second disc that mimics the Cinerama curved screen should give it a second view.  The reason I say this is because I've noticed that object movement on the right and left panels of the 3-camera film joins is less distorted in the Smilebox transfer than on the normal screen transfer.  Give the same scenes another look in both versions (such as the river raft sequence) and compare.

Regardless of your age and film content preferences, if you are just starting into Blu-Ray, make this film one of your ""must-purchase"" items!

HOW THE WEST WAS WON was one of two Cinerama movies released by MGM in 1962 (the other being ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"").  Covering the years 1838 through 1889, the story revolves around the fates and fortunes of the Prescott family as they attempt to tame the wilds of the western frontier.  The first half of the movie focuses on daughter Lilith (Debbie Reynolds), whose journey takes her across the Erie Canal, then along the great wagon-train migration and finally into the arms of handsome gambler Cleve van Valen (Gregory Peck).

In the second act, we meet Lilith's nephew Zeb (George Peppard), who leaves the small Prescott farm to fight in the Civil War; going on to become a marshall in peace-time.  The historical sweep of HOW THE WEST WAS WON is the main reason why it's still so incredibly entertaining all these years later; and miraculously--despite being directed by no less than four great filmmakers (John Ford, Henry Hathaway, George Marshall and Richard Thorpe)--it does feel like one unified piece.

Despite it's reputation as a star-studded extravaganza, in truth the film quite rightly belongs to Debbie Reynolds and George Peppard who play the key roles in both acts of the story; but the supporting gallery of players--very impressive even by today's standards--boasts Carroll Baker, John Wayne, Karl Malden, Robert Preston, Eli Wallach and Richard Widmark.

The Blu Ray release includes a bonus 'Smilebox' print of the film, which replicates the curved Cinerama screen experience--quite a treat!  The Cinerama process involved using three 35mm cameras to capture a scene and then projecting them side-by-side onto a louvered 3-panel screen; making it larger than most other 'scope' processes.  The system was later eclipsed by CinemaScope, Technirama and other, less expensive widescreen formats.

HOW THE WEST WAS WON sparkles wonderfully on BD, and comes equipped with a fantastic audio commentary in addition to the feature-length documentary ""Cinerama Adventure"" which delves into the history of the camera process (but sadly doesn't dwell much on the making of HTWWW).

So go ahead and pop the disc in the player...  I guarantee you'll get chills up and down your spine during the first few notes of the Main Title!  A mandatory title for classic movie fans, especially on BD.",1250121600,9,2590,5.152744630071599

Many others have already given detailed reviews of the movie itself, it's historical significance, plot synopsis, and critical remarks regarding the performances. But if you remember and have a fondness for the picture, this BluRay presentation hits the mark. The transfer and blending of the three film strips is almost flawless and you rarely notice the vertical separations. To fully realize the quality of this edition, you need to project the image onto an eight-foot wide screen or better and sit about six feet away. Add full multi-channel sound and you have an experience to enjoy. However, at the price it has dropped to recently, it's well worth it for the approximately 90 minute documentary on the development of CINERAMA. Warner Home Video and Amazon delivered on this one!

I have seen it on vhs and dvd. Very disappointing.
But now, in blue ray and on a 2.35 54 x 129 inch screen, wow wow. Colors and sharpness are spectacular. Also, they have managed to almost eliminate the seams where the screens met.
I cannot decide which version they provide you with to watch. The standard version even on a 2.35 screeen gives you black bars. Using the curved version you just get a strange scalloped part at the top and bottom.
The story works, not overly complicated. They have thrown most of MGM's stars into the movie. Great to hear Spencer Tracy do the narration.

158498,5,0792839072,"Look at this on a big screen TV!  The improvement in image quality, sharpness, and color on this blu-ray edition is enormous.  Watching this film in the SmilE format on the second disc is a treat and makes us remember what a spectacular stunt Cinerama was when we originally saw this on a huge curved panoramic screen for it's original release.  It's certainly the kind of startling innovative technology that sold tickets and put us in theater seats; but if you find it distracting, return to the conventional widescreen version on disc one.  Both are stunning--and somehow seem superior to the actual original projected theatrical film in their sharpness and color!

The very-widescreen image finally looks complete. The two ""un-seam-ly"" overlap lines that marred ALL previous showings, releases, and formats are almost totally and miraculously unnoticeable on both blu-ray discs!  Now, without experiencing those persistent distractions and odd distortions, we rediscovered a spectacular film with a surprising amount of good acting and witty and often moving dialogue.

Of course, it includes some of the most stunning classic action sequences this side of Ben Hur and CB DeMille!  And what a great cast and superb score. The blu-ray is a marvel and a must-have.

158499,4,0792839072,"One of old Hollywood's last big epics, 'How the West Was Won' is a classic tale of heroics and heartbreak, filmed in the now-defunct Cinerama process.

While light on cohesive story, the film is chock-full of Hollywood melodrama and amazing (for the time) camera work. Although it is definitely a sanitized look at the ""winning"" of the Old West, it holds up today for its successful portrayal of pioneers as real people who braved an unknown frontier to realize their dreams of a new life.

The Blu-ray ""Smilebox"" transfer, which tries to mimic the Cinerama experience, is interesting and provides a somewhat-accurate recreation of the Cinerama curved screen, although for maximum impact one should probably view it on a huge television or projection screen. In contrast, the flat letterbox version looks rather odd, since many shots include very prominent objects and sets on the left and right sides of the screen, which were designed for the Cinerama format but often seem to overpower the actors in the flat version.

For the most part the ""lines"" in the 3-camera Cinerama image are not visible, except during some shots of blue sky.

This is probably the best this film will look, at least for the forseable future, and Warner is to be commended for preserving this important and historic film in its original format.",1241654400,,1322,4.941441441441442
158500,5,0792839072,"An open letter to all techies out there, and I know you're out there:

You haven't seen anything until you have seen the potent combination of Blu-Ray technology and the new wide screen process called ""Smilebox""

What is Smilebox, you say?

Smilebox is the best thing to happen to home video since letterbox.  And for a super wide screen movie like the superb How the West Was Won, it's a marriage made in heaven.

Smilebox takes regular letterbox and literally turns it on its head! Instead of a sharp right angle letterbox image, Smilebox curves the picture up at the top, and down at the bottom. Like a smile! It really conveys the feeling of watching a Cinerama movie in the theater!

This unique process is perfect for the ingenious Cinerama process, developed in 1952 to get people back to the movie theaters and away from the growing number of television sets. And boy did it!  This is Cinerama was actually the number one grossing movie of 1952, even though it played in only a handful of Cinerama equipped theaters! People often lined up around the block.

The 1962 Cinerama movie How the West was Won, featuring an all-star cast, 3 directors, and a socko surround sound system, was also one of the top grossing movies of its year, even though it also only played roadshow engagements in theaters properly equipped with the super-wide screeen process. It virtually gave a ""3-D"" effect without glasses.

Try watching this one in the dark! That will really blow your socks off!

With Smilebox, Blu-Ray realizes its full potential.",1239753600,2,1537,4.766037735849056

I bought this movie to give my youngest boy and my grandchildren a taste of both old movies and ""How the West was Won"".  Though the movie is not politically correct it creates a forum for discussion about America's migration west.  As we venture into outer space, we may encounter the similar situations.

As of this moment we have not finished the movie.  The beginning is slow but very engaging.  I cannot recommend this movie enough!

I saw this movie when it was first released in 1962 at the Ambassador theater in St. Louis, Missouri. Interestingly enough the same place the documentary mentions at it's beginning. It was an experience I will never forget. This movie has been restored so well you will rarely know this was filmed with three cameras. But the vistas of the West will truly amaze you for a 46 year old movie. The movie has a very well known cast for that period and the story is compelling. A family heads West down a river in Ohio and ends up in California and then Arizona. How they live and die over the course of a lifetime is inspiring. Fans of movie history will especially get a kick out of this movie and the documentary on Cinerama. The process rivals IMAX even today. I highly recommend this piece of cinematic history. The Blu-ray version is magnificent quality and has plenty of replayability. If you enjoyed this catch ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"" when it is released.

158509,5,0792839072,"Cinerama.  As a young spud, how I remember what a big, big deal it was to take in a movie filmed in what was then state-of-the-art virtual technology.  Yesterday's Cinerama was today's Imax; only back then Cinerama was available in such limited theaters and locations it was an extra special event just to experience it.  And of the handful of Cinerama productions, the film most closely associated with the process was the 1962 epic HOW THE WEST WAS WON.  And this ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITION is grand entertainment. . .but not necessarily because of the movie itself.

The movie.  Of course, the visuals were, and are, impressive, but the story of two families settling (and taming) the West over some 50 years in the mid-19th Century suffered from what so many other films of that period suffered from:  gushy melodrama; cliches and stereotypes; grandiose overacting.  Is it grand fun to watch, say, Henry Fonda and George Peppard share a scene?  Sure.  But you also are guaranteed to experience a handful of cliches and maybe one or two more ""gosh darn it!""s that make the scene come across as somewhat contrived and artificial.  But again, merely a product of the times.  I was surprised to learn this film did win an Academy Award for best original screenplay--especially when the viewer is treated to such lines as this (from Richard Widmark):

""That ain't cryin'.  That's just new life goin' on!""

No, the real entertainment value of this edition resides in the special commentaries presented by filmmaker David Strohmaier; by director of Cinerama, Inc., John Sittig; by film historian Rudy Behlmer; by music historian Jon Burlingame; and by stuntman Loren James.  Their commentary as the film is shown contains a wealth of facts, nostalgia, interesting tidbits, and priceless information.  In particular, the commentary by James, who advises he performed around 80 percent of the stunts in the movie, is absolutely spellbinding.  Also very enjoyable were the comments regarding the discomfort the actors and directors experienced when filming in the Cinerama format--when three cameras, or panels, were used to film each shot.  Unless the two actors were in the same camera panel--and because the three-camera shot was so wide--the actors could not look directly at one another, but instead had to look off to the side, pretending they were seeing each other.  Upon learning this, if you'll go back and look at the movie, you can discern this is indeed the case; the actors are looking over one another's shoulders.

Fascinating stuff.

And another treasure can be found in the third disc, a documentary entitled ""Cinerama Adventure.""  This feature explores the development and history of how the Cinerama process came to be, the dynamic and colorful people who brought the format to the public, and the absolute cultural craze Cinerama brought to the entire world during the 1950s and early 1960s.  During the presentation, the viewer is treated to remarkable clips from Cinerama travel features that mesmerized millions of theater goers.  Alas, HOW THE WEST WAS WON was the last feature filmed in Cinerama (the studios realized the three-camera process was too cumbersome, problematic, and expensive), yet the format caused the entire motion picture industry to go to 70mm cameras, thereby ushering in cinematic widescreen still going strong today.  This documentary is delightful and engaging.

Finally, this ULTIMATE COLLECTOR'S EDITION includes nifty replicas of the press booklets actually handed out to the media when the film was released, along with black-and-white and color photos taken while the film was in production.  And to top it all off, the CDs and the collectibles are all encased in leather facade pouches--yet another salute to the Old West.  This edition of HOW THE WEST WAS WON is a must-have for all movie collectors and film buffs.

The picture and sound quality on this film is stunning, particularly on the second disc which includes the Cinerama version. When you turn down the lights, pop this into your Blu-Ray player and the MGM logo appears on the screen followed quickly by the opening credits, you will know you're in for a treat. I was not born when this movie was released in 1962 and could only use my imagination on how it might have appeared in theaters. With this version, I now know what it was like.

The first time I saw this movie, it was a pan and scan version, and then some years later, I saw a letterbox version on TCM. Those versions do not hold a candle to this, and I can't imagine the regular DVD version coming close, either. Not only does the Cinerama simulation work, the detail and color of the picture is spectacular. It is almost like you are there. The sound in the Dolby TrueHD format is incredible, thrilling.

It's not my favourite film but the reason for buying was the grandeur of it, some miscolouring still appears from time to time where the film stocks were joined but it doesn't hurt the overall feel of it.

It's understandable after seeing this as well as home video allows why only two Cinerama films were made, for all its grandeur it doesn't present any better than the extra wide but normal films that followed, with the distorted fish-eye like view sometimes detracting.

158531,4,0792839072,"These days, American history has been minimized in schools, under the guise of ""cultural diversity.""  This film may not fully correct this, but it does provide an idea of what the United States' cultural roots have been.

The story begins tracing the story of a family migrating from the eastern states to the frontier of the time, and of a mountain man, a trapper who interacted with western American Indians well beyond the explored lands.  The family meets tragedy, with one of the daughters and the mountain man falling in love, and the other daughter -- a free spirit of the time -- living a wilder life as a singer and entertainer.

From the post-revolutionary world through the Civil War and beyond, the stories of the two branches of the family are shown, covering the sweep of historic events until the close of the 19th Century, not counting a rapid epilog.

The film was sjot in Cinerama, using the original three-camera process, so thwere is a discernable jiggle at the two joins between the photos, and naturally, the scope of the original is literally minimized on the average video screen.  Yet this is counterbalamced by really striking scenes of the untamed wiorld of the pioneers.

The film is also more honest than many is the dealings between the settlers and the American Indians, showing cases of how treaties were broken, and the natural reaction for such actions.

The film has formidible star power, with many of the top stars from the time it was shot present in significant roles.

Hardly a perfect film, but it does provide some perspective of how the nation developed.",1224115200,,1597,4.799270072992701

158537,4,0792839072,"James R. Webb's original screenplay for the screen won an Oscar in 1962 and it involves an episodic account of the Prescott family and their contribution to settling the American west in the 19th century. We first meet the Prescott's, Karl Malden and Agnes Moorehead going west on the Erie Canal and later by flatboat on the Ohio River. They have two daughters, dreamy romantic Carroll Baker and feisty Debbie Reynolds. The girls meet and marry mountain man James Stewart and gambler Gregory Peck eventually and their adventures and those of their children are what make up the plot of How the West Was Won.

Three of Hollywood's top directors did parts of this film although the lion's share by all accounts was done by Henry Hathaway. John Ford did the Civil War sequence and George Marshall the sequence about the railroad.

The Civil War piece featured John Wayne and Harry Morgan in a moment of reflection at the battlefield of Shiloh. Morgan did a first rate job as Grant in his brief cameo and Wayne was playing Sherman for the second time in his career. He'd previously played Sherman in a cameo on his friend Ward Bond's Wagon Train series. I'm surprised Wayne never did Sherman in a biographical film, he would have been good casting.

If any of the stars could be said to be THE star of the film it would have to be Debbie Reynolds. She's in the film almost through out and in the last sequence where as a widow she goes to live with her nephew George Peppard and his family she's made up as a gray haired old woman and does very well with the aging. Debbie also gets to do a couple of musical numbers, A Home in the Meadow and Raise A Ruckus both blend in well in the story. Debbie's performance in How the West Was Won must have been the reason she was cast in The Unsinkable Molly Brown.

Cinerama was rarely as effectively employed as in How the West Was Won. I well remember feeling like you were right on the flatboat that the Presscott family was on as they got caught in the Ohio River rapids. The Indian attack and the buffalo stampede were also well done. But the climax involving that running gun battle between peace officers George Peppard and Lee J. Cobb with outlaw Eli Wallach and his gang on a moving train even on a formatted VHS is beyond thrilling.

There is a sequence that was removed and it had to do with Peppard going to live with buffalo hunter Henry Fonda and marrying Hope Lange who was Fonda's daughter. She dies and Peppard leaves the mountains and then marries Carolyn Jones. Lange's part was completely left on the cutting room floor. I was hopeful in this version we'd see Hope Lange and more of Henry Fonda.

Considering you have all those Hollywood legends in one exciting film. They really don't make them like this any more.",1223683200,,2772,4.500994035785288
158538,5,0792839072,"It's hard to convey to today's younger audience the impact that the ""Cinerama"" theater experience had on 1950's-60's audiences. It was the ulimate 3D of its day. Three giant screens - two of which curved around the front sides of the theater -- with three separate projectors plus surround sound channels -- all combined into a memorable movie experience. How the West was Won was an attempt to use this process in a story telling movie script. This may not have succeeded per se, but some of the scenery and acting by Hollywood's legendary actors makes it interesting, especially if you fast-forward some of the less interesting scenes.

Now thanks to digital technology the Cinerama effect can be simulated at home, particularly for those with big front-screen projection set-ups.  This Blu-ray edition includes perhaps the most unique-to-date disc projection called ""SmileBox"". It attempts to recreate that 3-screen, wrap-around affect using an optical hour-glass display of the original film. The bigger your screen the more realistic. We have a 14-foot wide Elite screen and leverage a Panasonic AX100U projector in our family room. Wow!  If you are a techie film buff and ever had attended a 'live' Cinerama show, this is for you. Again, this best on large screens only I suggest.

Also, some real digital clean-up work was spent on this newest release making the purchasing a worthwhile addition to a home video library.",1223337600,,1427,5.085470085470085
158539,5,0792839072,"Experiencing the 1963 version at a CINERAMA theater was breathtaking and unbelievable with that 146 degree 3 projector screen bigger than life.

Not since then have we been able to re-experience that magical event until NOW.  Yes my fellow movie buffs this Blu-ray Hi-def Picture and Hi-Def Sound 2008 version with its pioneering technology can be enjoyed once again.  In fact with the true HD Blu-ray HDMI Home Theater you can experience a better ""HOW THE WEST WAS WON"" visual wonderland!

My qualifying statement:  My HD Home theater weighs in at about $2000 plus movies.  A break down is; a Mitsubishi Projector(HC-1500) $800 (orig $1495), a Sony 5.1 Sound system (HT-SS2300) $400 (orig $500) and a Sony Playstation 3 with Blu-ray player $400 (orig $500).  Sony HDMI cables $150 and HD Screen paint and kit $180 for my 108"" viewing wall screen.  With this 1080p system I've created a HD Home Theater presentation sight and sound equal to an IMAX (on a smaller scale) experience.

The 1080p Blu-ray showing blows your minds eye, period.  Their are 2 discs and 2 versions.  Whats incredible is watching the SmileBox transfer replicating the CINERAMA wraparound theatrical experience right in your own home.  By curving the flat 2D picture (disc 1) into a smile simulates the 146 degree 3D image (disc 2)of CINERAMA.  Whats truly amazing is the people on the edges appear to be in the foreground on opposite sides talking to each other.  You have to see it to believe it.  The clarity is so clear you think your living the experience today not 1963.  Only seeing the youthful movie stars brings you to the realization on the true date of this spectacular epic eye candy.  With Blu-ray you are swept off to where ever they take you.

Bottomline: Blu-ray, HD HDMI 5.1 Home Theater is the only way to enjoy this SmileBox version of ""HOW THE WEST WAS WON"".  Bonus extra CINERAMA ADVENTURE is a 96 minute documentary about the CINERAMA process and history.  This alone is worth the price of the set NOTE: I suggest you watch this documentary prior to watching the movie for the appreciation of the entire magical process.

158540,5,0792839072,"I saw this movie in Washington, DC, at the Uptown Theater, the only true Cinerama theater in town. The 3-70mm camera Cinerama experience was far more important than the actual movie but it was fantastic! Actually, I went back and saw this movie three times, all because of Cinerama.

I love westerns, always have, but this one, from a pure movie standpoint, is not great. You can easily see the different director's styles as the film moves from era to era and sometimes the acting and writing is, to be charitable, weak. Nonetheless, the scope and beauty is undeniable.

Now, this digital transfer is here and it's outstanding in every way. Blu Ray really does it justice and anyone who considers older films unworthy for HD release should see this. It's not pristine but it's up there with the best and the ""lines"" separating the three camera screens, so evident in the original, has been nearly eliminated . Surprisingly, the ""Smilebox"" format works very well, simulating the original three camera experience. I found myself sitting on the floor in front of my usual sofa seating position and creeping closer and closer to my 60"" Sony. It brought back fond memories of the original viewings at the Uptown.

In fact, I'm going back to see it again tomorrow night!

158541,3,0792839072,"I'm afraid that I must agree with some of the less popular and more critical assessments of this newly remastered edition of ""How the West Was Won"" in that it's just not all that great. While the action sequences are spellbinding, most of this movie is tedious and difficult to watch. Somebody dumped a pile of cash on this picture to demonstrate what can be done with Cinerama but, unfortunately, not much can really be done, outside of the 'roller-coaster' shots.

This is a 'restored' version and it is miles better than previously released renditions of HtWWW; eliminating all dirt and scratches found on the old prints (what some here have described as 'dirt' spots in the opening ariel scene are just water droplets on the window); eliminating the 'join' lines between panels (except for a couple of pan shots where they are hard to ignore); also, color has been corrected and carefully matched between panels. Sound is very good, for the most part, but at times a bit distorted and the dialog volume is uneven and could benefit from some better equalization.

I would have given this 2 stars, except for the inclusion, on the third disc, of Dave Strohmaier's excellent documentary, ""Cinerama Adventure"".

There are a few big problems with this new DVD collection that bother me: First, there is some kind of digital ""smoothing"" that has been applied to the finished product, which may help to make visual discrepancies less noticeable during the transfer to disc, but makes the image a little less sharp than it could be, and really needs to be, for this movie. I've seen sharper digital transfers from WB and MGM on many other standard definition videos, and unfortunately, the documentary also suffers this fate. I know because I saw it in a theatre. Secondly; Don't get hung up over the ""Smilebox"" idea. You can see how it works in the documentary and, although it's suppose to give you an idea of what Cinerama would look like in a theater, it gets to be a bit too much after a while. This brings me to my third complaint: That (as others have already said here) the whole movie looks 'fisheyed' and is very distracting to watch, especially actor's faces where the nose is exaggerated and eyes and mouth are small. Rather unflattering that these gorgeous movie stars look like they're in a bad high school yearbook photo! Everything looks VERY far away, as though you are viewing through a distant keyhole, and I think the Smilebox effect accentuates this, making it look even farther away, as though you are in the back of the audience (which works well for the documentary, but not the feature). I kept reaching for my binoculars, even though I'm 6 feet away from a 120-inch screen! Maybe the Blu-Ray edition is sharper and bigger, but Cinerama was designed to be viewed on a very large, deeply curved screen, and there's just no way to make it look natural on a flat surface. Even close-up shots, which there are not many, feel distant and contribute to the 'big nose' problem. Making this issue even worse, the top and bottom edges of the frame has been cropped a bit (not the sides, as in previous versions) so the aspect ratio is up to 2.9, not 2.55 as it says here, or even 2.7, which Cinerama would be if projected flat. Talk about looking through a keyhole!

Problem #4: It's really a lousy movie. It's way too long; there's very little continuity and can often be rather confusing, even with a narrator to tie it together (somewhat). The script is terrible; the actors are doing the best they can with lousy dialog but are completely wasted in this picture; little is done with the camera compared to any other dramatic film - it just sits there most of the time, as if you are supposed to be a distant bystander (""distant"" being the operative word here). Except for the very few extreme closeup shots (big noses) and one or two single-lens-camera shots inserted into the action sequences, it is impossible to see facial expressions. The major action scenes are great, but also suffer in continuity and can be confusing. How did the water tower sequence get into the trailer and not the movie???

The only reason to buy this title is for the documentary, a handful of action sequences, and the picture-postcard panoramas. The commentary tracks offer a lot of nice-to-know information but once you know it, better to turn it off and listen to the music. The booklets offer nothing except forgotten Hollywood hype and can't be read without a powerful magnifying glass! As a dramatic western, most others (like, ""The Searchers"") outclass this one by light-years. As entertainment, don't waste your money. See it only at a genuine 3-projector Cinerama theatre.",1222646400,5,4677,4.754926108374384

Warners did a lot of work to spruce up this film. Unfortunately, it was designed and shot to be shown on a curved screen, one that occupied a full third of a circle. It was never meant to be shown on a flat screen, and it just looks ridiculous when it is. Without the screen curvature, people seem to change direction as they move from center to side. Worse, when people are on either side of the screen, they appear to be staring into space when they are supposed to be looking at the main action in the center of the screen. What are supposed to be vast vistas end up looking like they were filmed through a fisheye lens. It's all very distracting and more than a bit hard on the eyes.

All the effort to preserve the entire picture is not really worth it, either, because most of the time the action is carefully constrained to the middle third of the picture. You end up with the paradox of a vast widescreen image that feels very claustrophobic in its composition.

Maybe if the script was more interesting these visual problems wouldn't matter so much. But it's not that great a movie. It was designed to show off the 3-projector Cinerama technology and it remains a prisoner of that technology. When you lose the ""wow"" factor of a Cinerama theater, and have the visuals mangled onto a flat screen, HTWWW becomes just a minor curiosity.

The Blu-Ray edition is said to have a ""Smilebox"" version of the movie--Smilebox is supposed to correct for the problems of smashing a curved screen presentation down to a flat screen. I don't know how well that works--Blu-Ray is still too expensive and still has very little depth of catalog, so it's not on my horizon. There is no good reason why the standard DVD version could not have been in Smilebox if it really does solve the severe visual distortions.",1222387200,4,2049,4.574931880108992

Add to this one of the most entertaining, informative Audio Commentary tracks I've ever listened to, and you have a DVD that is truly worth owning!

Taking a moment to reflect on the Commentary...I am disappointed that no 'Making of...' video has been made, as ""How the West Was Won"", with it's stellar cast, legendary directors, and massive production, certainly deserves one. But the Audio Commentary makes a sincere effort to make up for it, offering information on the locations, how the extraordinary shots were created, and backstories about casting and the production. A surprising bit of HTWWW trivia: Did you know that Bing Crosby was originally slated to narrate the film, with Spencer Tracy to portray Ulysses S. Grant? (The reason Tracy switched to narrating isn't explained in the Commentary, but I am familiar with what happened; Tracy collapsed at his home, prior to filming, and had to be rushed by ambulance to the UCLA Hospital; under doctor's orders to rest, he was unable to perform in a role, but still wanted to participate in some manner, so Crosby, graciously, gave up the narration to him). A health issue created another change, as well; Dimitri Tiomkin, the contracted composer of the musical score, broke his leg, and had to be replaced by Alfred Newman, who did a magnificent job. Another surprising fact: Hope Lange was originally cast to play George Peppard's wife, with a long subplot revealing she was Henry Fonda's daughter, first seen working as a showgirl at the railroad camp, where she was courted by both Peppard and Richard Widmark. Despite some scenes being filmed, it was decided the subplot took too much time from the main storyline, so her scenes were cut, and reshot to remove any reference to her, with Carolyn Jones cast in a far shorter version of her role, for the final sequence of the film.

Much more is included in the Commentary, which really encourages a viewer to watch the film at least twice!

The third DVD in the collection (the first two discs are of the film, itself), is devoted to a long history of the Cinerama process, from it's roots during the silent era, it's value during WWII as a training tool, the spectacular, and once, tragic, Cinerama travelogues, through the decision to scrap the 'three-camera' process in favor of a less difficult 70mm 'single-camera' process (HTWWW would be the last film using the original format), and it's ultimate demise, in favor of less costly formats. As someone whose first Cinerama experience was the 'single-camera' ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", the documentary makes me wish I'd experienced the superior 'three-camera' films, with full stereophonic sound, on a giant curved screen!

Lots of reproductions of original release promotional materials are included in the package, as well, which are fun to browse through, while you're watching the film.

Entertaining, educational, fun...""How the West Was Won (Ultimate Collector's Edition)"" is all this, and MUCH more!",1221436800,16,3356,5.094545454545455
158556,5,0792839072,"The three disc set has the movie on two discs with the trailer on the second one. The third disc contains a fascinating documentary called Cinerama Adventure. The documentary is worth the price of the set!

  The trailer is not restored, so it is a handy three-panel source to compare with the new, seamless realese.

  How the West Was Won looks fabulous; the lines are indeed gone. The picture is w-i-d-e. So wide, the documentary states, that actors did not look directly at each other during shooting, but off to the side a bit so that they would appear to be facing each other on the Cinerama screen.

  The field of view on How the West Was Won is much greater than, for instance, that of Ben Hur. But the letterboxing on the How the West Was Won DVD is not as severe as it is on the Ben Hur DVD.

  The sound is great, as well. In the documentary we learn that Cinerama music track recordings were done in Oyster Bay, Long Island, New York, of all places, using a who's who of New York City-area orchestra members.

  During each theatrical Cinerama screening a sound engineer mixed the seven tracks on the spot, taking into account the number of people in the house, whether or not they had coats, things like that.

  How the West Was Won--the last true Cinerama film--has been given a restoration worthy of the whole remarkable Cinerama enterprise.",1221350400,10,1358,4.518518518518518
158557,5,0792839072,"If the legendary creators of Cinerama could speak from the heavens, they would surely want to praise the efforts of David Strohmaier. He has not only led the crusade to save and preserve the artform of three strip exhibition but through his determination has defined a new and better way to see what Cinerama was like for those not available to see it in all its theatrical glory.

Smilebox is the creation and it is used to wonderful effect in the new DVD presentation of How The West Was Won.  Through new and complicated technology, the curved look of Cinerama can be seen on the television screen.  A Strohmaier creation, this duplicates the appromimate look and feel as if you were in a Cinerama theater, sans the curved screen.

The presentation of this classic western also removes the join lines of the three strips of film, well, almost removes them.  Purists will debate their removal but if they could have been taken out from the beginning, they would have.  I believe Lowell Thomas and Cooper would approve.

As wonderful as the film is, it's the documentary, Cinerama Adventure that is the real prize here.  Not since the days of Kevin Brownlow and David Gill has there been such a rich and loving look at a film genre.  Told with footage from other Cinerama films, rare behind the scenes footage, photos and with interviews from those who were there, this is the fastest ninety minute ride a film fan can have.  The early experiments of multi strip projection are fascinating.  The sequence of going through a live volcano while the plane stalls in mid air is riviting.  With music by the prolific John Morgan, the man who has reconstructed classic film scores, this is a film to be viewed again and again.

Make no mistake, this is the DVD event of the year.  The transfer (all new) of How The West Was Won is fabulous.  The documentary is included as a bonus piece but, believe me, once you see it, you will want to know everything else there is to know about CInerama.  Thank you Dave Strohmaier for your creations of both Smilebox and your moving and delightful love letter to Cinerama.

158558,1,0792839072,"very disappointed... This movie was so highly abridged that the life and adventures of the characters portrayed by Gregory Peck and Debbie Reynolds are totally absent. Gregory Peck does not even appear in this version,  except as a photo in the old lady's locket, and the rest of the story fails to get fleshed out.  It is like buying a side of beef and ending up with nothing but the hooves and horns. (where's the Beef?!) Anyone who rates this movie above 0-1 never saw the original epic movie.  Total waste of my money!

It has now been a long time since I viewed my ( STD) DVD  but the story about the death of Jimmy Stewards character and George Papards experiences at war are omitted and everything from when he returned home to find his mother dead till his experiences as a sheriff  or marshal are omitted as well.  It could very well be that my DVD is just defective but the omittiion was seamless.",1221350400,,907,4.427710843373494
158559,5,0792839072,"A massive, sprawling epic shot in the three camera Cinerama Process popular during the early 60's, ""How the West Was Won"" spans from 1830 to 1880 covering the history of the westward expansion. Directed by three directors (John Ford, Henry Hathaway and George Marshall with a fourth Richard Thorpe providing uncredited linking pieces)""How the West Was Won"" was produced during the twilight of the western as the most popular type genre.

Warner has done a painstaking job of restoring this classic film and although it isn't perfect, it's an exceptional job that deserves kudos. The film has never looked this good with colors that pop and accurate fleshtones. More important the seams that one could see for the separate cameras aren't quite as glaring as before. The image quality is exceptionally crisp with terrific detail. Audio sounds extremely good with a nice 5.1 mix.

The film is spread over two discs with the original Overture and Alfred Newman's marvelous score included as part of the package. We get a terrific feature length commentary track from  ""West"" stuntman Loren James who provides plenty of background details about the physical shooting of the film, filmmaker David Strohmaier, film scholar Rudy Behlmer, Cierama's John Sittig and music historian Jon Burlingame. My only complaint is that Burlingame will make a comment about listening to Newman's marvelous score and then whomever edited his comments continues to play them right over the music cue we should be listening to without interruption.

The only other complaint that I have is that while the dirt and grit has been removed making the film look marvelous, there's one sequence that has always bugged me--there is a bit of dirt right in the middle of the frame of the opening fly over sequence that I wish they could have figured out how to remove. Other than that, it's pretty smooth looking throughout the presentation despite an occasiona bit of image unsteadiness as characters move across the screen and span of the three cameras lenses.

We also get a terrific hour and a half documentary on the Cinerama process on the third disc.

There are three different versions of the film in re-release: the first is a three disc DVD edition with just the film; the second is the three disc set postcards, a reproduction of the original press book, souvenir book and photos as part of the package;there is no equivalent for this SCE in the Blu-ray edition although it does have a booklet as part of that package.

The image and sound quality in this restored edition improves on the original single disc edition of the film with a terrific commentary track and documentary to round out the set. With a stunning casts (James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Carolyn Jones, Debbie Reynolds, Carol Baker, Lee J. Cobb, George Peppard, John Wayne, Lee Van Cleef, Karl Malden, Agnes Moorehead and others)this was truly one of the last epic, lyrical westerns to be produced in Hollywood. Highly recommended.",1221350400,214,2972,4.979838709677419
158560,5,0792839072,"This review is for the August 2008 release and is not to be confused with earlier releases as they were inferior in video and audio quality and were highly cropped versions. I won't go into reviewing the movie itself since there are many of them available elsewhere, but this is a movie covering the expansion of the west done on a grand scale with many of the best actors and directors of the time with magnificent musical scores.

Having seen the original screening at the Warner Hollywood Theater, this DVD does an outstanding job of bringing back fond memories of a spectacular film. While nothing can re-capture the experience of setting within a deeply curved screen, this release is the best thing yet. Viewers should be aware that this is a `highly' letterboxed film meaning the aspect ratio is around 2.8 to 1, width to height. You will need a widescreen TV, the bigger, the better. There is a high definition `Smileboxed' version available on Blu-ray that attempts to simulate the curved screen and is worth considering if you have a Blu-ray player.

With this release, Warner Bros. has done a superb job of restoration and they have erased and/or softened the join lines between the three separate frames that constitute the Cinerama image. Did they remove the join lines completely? No, but it is far less noticeable than the original on-screen Cinerama presentation. At a running length of 164 minutes, this movie could have been put on a single DVD, however Warner transferred this movie at an extremely high average bitrate, necessitating the use of two discs instead of one, eking out just about all of the detail possible from standard definition video. Even on a standard DVD player, it could easily be mistaken for a high definition picture. The break between the two discs is identical to the original presentation which had an intermission break, so there is no loss to continuity.

For me, the bonus features make this collection worth the price; The 97 minute documentary, `Cinerama Adventure' is an outstanding film covering the fascinating history of the Cinerama process. A feature length audio commentary spans the full length of the film on discs one and two. Participants include filmmaker David Strohmaier, Cinerama, Inc. Director John Sittig, Film Historian Rudy Behlmer, Music Historian Jon Burlingame, and Stuntman Loren James. This is very interesting commentary for those interested in the making of the film.

Beautiful packaging with lobby cards, behind the scenes photos and an original program reproduction round out this collection. Well done and highly recommended!",1221264000,5,2606,5.067599067599067
158561,2,0792839072,"I give this DVD Re-issue two stars for its beautiful packaging in its embossed casing and the inner sleeves and booklets and photos that it comes with and also to the wider aspect ratio and clearer picture...but overall I am very disappointed in this.  First of all, the three-camera angle image is NOT completely erased...you can still see it when scenes change. It looks like it was airbrushed out and you can even notice a difference in the Technicolor print.  Second of all, the sound in not much better than the original one-disc version in 5.1 Surround and there is a slight pause or muting of the sound at the very end of the first two chapters, which is very noticeable. The best scoring of the film is at the beginning during the credits and should be more powerful, but it is not...it sounds different right from the beginning and a little distorted...Also the sticker on the outside of the shrink wrap says"" over 4 hours of bonus feature content""..this is totally false..all it has is a documentary ""Cinerama Adventure"" on the third disc, which is 1 hour and 36 minutes...the rest is commentaries over the film and a theatrical trailer on the first disc.  They even had to chop this film in half and put it on two discs...it is only 2 hours and 44 minutes...give me a break! This completely ruins the continuity of the film. It could have fit intact on one complete disc, which would in turn kept the price down. If TITANIC fit on one disc and several other films, this should have too. If you have the original one-disc DVD, there is no need to upgrade to this, unless you care about photos, booklets and a re-packaging...even the original has a better anamorphic aspect ratio...look out Warner Bros...I hope when you decide to release RAINTREE COUNTY to DVD for the first time, you do it right.",1221264000,2,1807,4.605590062111801

The BluRay transfer is sharp and has a excellent blacks and contrast rations on my 1080i 50"" plasma screen.  I'd want to see 1080p on LCD before passing final judgment though.

The film content itself is quite anachronistic and represents the nationalistic views of the era in which it was made; it was a surprise to be reminded that HTWWW won an Oscar for best screenplay!  The story rambles like the wide Missouri but the film still entertains well enough after 45 years.

158567,3,0792839072,"This Cinerama films is a major challenge to reproduce on video.  Previous releases were either pan-and-scanned or flat letterbox, leaving annoying lines between the three panels.  (The film was shot with three separate cameras and originally projected by three synchronized projectors.  I saw this film in Cinerama and you could see the lines.)

This new HD release has been extensively restored, and mostly it looks spectacular.  Unfortunately, they did not remove all the lines.  During several sequences, including the railroad sequence and the closing shots, the center panel is a big dark smudge, which is really disappointing, since most of the film looks astonishingly good.  The previous DVD release was ludicrously bad, and this is a 1000% improvement, but it still falls short.

I watched the ""Smilebox"" version, which attempts to simulate a curved screen.  This works well, although the center panel has to be smaller, and since that's where the actors are most of the time, there aren't many close ups.  However, this movie is all about the spectacular set pieces:  the raft on the rapids, the buffalo stampede, the train robbery.  Most of these come through intact, but it's frustrating that the picture couldn't look that good for the *whole* film.  To be immersed in brilliant Blu-Ray, and then suddenly see a big dark smudge across the center of the screen is a bringdown.

The movie itself is a cheesy piece of fluff; I saw it when I was nine and absolutely adored it, so it's fun to see it every once in a while.  Maybe someday they'll find a way to fix those remaining problems, but for now this is a good as it gets.",1221004800,5,1636,4.83453237410072

For the most part the 3 panel Cinerama camera lines are gone showing glorious vistas and the heart winning story.  However if you look carefully at times you can still see the join lines.  And the process that was used to compensate for the deep curvature of the Cinerama screen still causes distortion especially seen in shadows beneath signs or most strikingly at the end of the film when the camera zooms under the Golden Gate Bridge. The 5.1 Digital sound is great and the color has never been better.
However as great as it is to see this restored version of How the West was Won, it still suffers even on a large screen HDTV.  If possible try to see the film in its original form at one of three theaters still capable of showing Cinerama films.",1221004800,,849,4.3544303797468356
158569,5,0792839072,"As noted below, color correction and image adjustments are as good as it gets. In most scenes it's hard to see the frame joins. Occasionally there is a weird camera movement or screen action to bring it to your attention, but mostly it's hard to see.

Disc 1 - The documentary is excellent and the transfer is something like 2:78.1- very wide. The image joins are also more noticeable here than on Disc 2.

Disc 2 - SmileBox edition that simulates the Cinerama screen is curved and larger on the sides than the middle. A little odd at first, but once I moved a bit closer to the screen it really came alive. About as near as you can get to the theatre experience. Very cool!!

After seeing clips of ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" in the SmileBox format in the documentary I want this title released that way, too. Even though it was not shot in 'true 3 camera Cinerama' like this film, it was shown on the huge Cinerama screen. Many of the scenes would benefit from the curved screen effect. It's Warner Bros, too. Maybe a future 'Special Edition' SmileBox Blu-Ray?",1221004800,2,1058,4.471502590673575

This is one of the best blu-rays I've seen so far. The detail from the Cinerama image is amazing, REALLY amazing. A few of the process shots are softer but that's how they always looked. Most of the time you can't see the ""seams"" at all. Only occasionally can you detect a color differential, particularly in big blue skies. This one's a slam dunk!",1221004800,7,648,4.319672131147541
158571,4,0792839072,"This new restoration of ""How the West Was Won"" is certainly a significant improvement over previous video releases (and is also superior to a 35mm anamorphic print I have seen). The color here may be a bit too red, but in general the picture looks very good and the compositing and color regularization of the three Cinerama panels is nothing short of miraculous.

There is also an excellent 90 minute documentary on the Cinerama process that I found even more engaging than the film.

I won't go into the intricacies of the aspect ratio question, but the resolved widescreen image appears to include the entire screen image (which is, I think, somewhat wider than the original Cinerama presentation would have been, on account of the optical correction of the screen curvature). Amazon currently lists this as ""1.33:1,"" which is of course incorrect (even the supplementary documentary is anamorphic widescreen).

Sadly, though, the DVD release does not contain the additional ""SmileBox"" transfer that is included with the Blu-ray release.  This provides a simulation of the deep screen curvature of Cinerama and, from the looks of the many clips included in the supplemental documentary that are in this format, it provides a much closer approximation of the intended theatrical experience than a flattened transfer, no matter how optically scrupulous.  For this reason, I would discourage anyone from buying the DVD version who expects to make the switch to Blu-Ray in the foreseeable future.

A nice transfer, but the absence of the SmileBox version left me feeling less than satisfied with this release.",1221004800,5,1607,5.161538461538462

George Pal's ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"" was the first -- released in 1962 in the three-screen process. I still have the original road-show souvenir book and it states it clearly. ""Bros. Grimm"" was the first, ""How the West was Won"" was the second -- then, because of so much revenue being generated from its ""ordinary theatrical release"" the company was forced to make a compromise: A single-lens, single-curved screen process for future Cinerama productions. This was initiated with Stanley Kramer's ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and followed by such films as Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and John Sturges' ""The Hallelujah Trail"". I just needed to get the facts straight here.

Incidentaly, this three-lens, three-screen process of ""Bros. Grimm"" and ""How the West Was Won"" is why the DVD release has unavoidably two lines running down the middle, and the strange effect of, say, a wagon rolling horizontally seeming to be constantly riding in a warped circle. This is because of the three screens being flattened back onto a straight surface.

One more thing: Alfred Newman's great score for ""How the West Was Won"" is truly one of the greatest western film scores in history (even quoted in other films as a quintessential western score -- check out the Western fantasy sequence in ""Romancing the Stone"") and to hear it in true 5.1 sound is worth the price alone!",1220918400,3,1680,4.887719298245614

This was initiated with Stanley Kramer's ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and followed by such films as Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and John Sturges' ""The Hallelujah Trail"".  I just needed to get the facts straight here. As an admirer of the original film since seeing it in the original three-screen Cinerama process when I was a kid, I hate to inform you all that, although released in Europe first, it was NOT the first narrative feature film in the three-screen Cinerama process (although it was the last).

George Pal's ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"" was the first -- released in 1962 in the three-screen process. I still have the original road-show souvenir book and it states it clearly. ""Bros. Grimm"" was the first, ""How the West was Won"" was the second -- then, because of so much revenue being generated from its ""ordinary theatrical release"" the company was forced to make a compromise: A single-lens, single-curved screen process for future Cinerama productions. This was initiated with Stanley Kramer's ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" and followed by such films as Kubrick's ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and John Sturges' ""The Hallelujah Trail"". I just needed to get the facts straight here.

Incidentally, this three-lens, three-screen process of ""Bros. Grimm"" and ""How the West Was Won"" is why the DVD release has unavoidably two lines running down the middle, and the strange effect of, say, a wagon rolling horizontally seeming to be constantly riding in a warped circle. This is because of the three screens being flattened back onto a straight surface.

One more thing: Alfred Newman's great score for ""How the West Was Won"" is truly one of the greatest western film scores in history (even quoted in other films as a quintessential western score -- check out the Western fantasy sequence in ""Romancing the Stone"") and to hear it in true 5.1 sound is worth the price alone!",1219276800,10,2678,4.911504424778761
158583,1,0792839072,"How The West Was Won came out in Cinerama in 1962 and when released to the average theatres, the lines from the Cinerama process were frozen in a 35mm print. The hope was that the film might make one overlook this distraction. No such luck.

There is one scene to see: the Buffalo stampede

Perhaps too, the Jimmy Stewart /Carroll Baker love scene, where you can see Stewart cracking up at the lines he has to deliver.

This is sheer nonsense, and unintentionally funny in mny spots: Debbie Reynolds as an old woman in her wig, Karl Malden in any scene, and Agnes Moorehead.

When these films are ran on TCM, the quality is absolutely excellent mint condition. I don't need a cover. No Big Deal! I will just record it on my DVD Recorder & it will cost me about only 20 cents to do it. Whoever buys this film & pays $41.99 for it, more power to you, but you are a FOOL!

And the Blu-ray hi-def transfer is truly breathtaking.  I literally gasped when I saw it.  And so have special preview audiences of the hi-def DVD.

Warner -- which owns the pre 1986 MGM library -- has spent a ton of dough getting this right.  Six years, hundreds of people, thousands of hours and millions of dollars have been invested in creating and applying new technology that has virtually erased the ""join lines"" that marred the earlier -- rather hideous -- video transfers.  Not only that, but every frame has been restored.  That's the equivalent of restoring three 35 MM films -- the original was exposed using three alligned cameras.  The final aspect ratio is 2.89:1 (that's nearly three times as wide as it is high).  And it is a wondrous sight to behold.

Seeing this new version is like experiencing the film for the first time.  The familiar story -- based on a series in Life magazine -- follows three generations of a typical pioneer Ohio Valley family from 1839 to 1889.  A myriad of stars shine in this great American adventure -- John Wayne, Gregory Peck, Jimmy Stewart, Debbie Reynolds, Karl Malden, Lee J. Cobb and Carrol Baker are among the many recognizable faces.

Three accomplished directors (including John Ford) helmed this rousing epic that does not degrade the Native American experience even as it allows for the conflicts the westward movement created.

The absolutely stunning Blu-ray version inlcudes a ""smilebox"" transfer that mimics the original Cinerama experience of a giant curved screen.  On a large video display -- especially if projected on a big pull down screen -- this version is jaw-dropping.

The extras include Rudy Strohmaier's much acclaimed documentary ""Cinerama Adventure.""  And there's a wonderful commentary by filmmaker Strohmaier, John Sittig (director of Cinerama, Inc.), film historian Rudy Behlmer, music historian Jon Burlingame and stuntman Loren James.  But why no Debbie Reynolds?

The only other narrative three camera Cinerama film is ""The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"" and  the stored negative has suffered water damage so there are no plans for a full restoration at this time.

As a kid I saw this film at the Warner Cinerama Theater (not the Cinerama Dome) in Hollywood.  The impact of the big sound and images swept me away and I remember the experience vividly.  The rousing music, the involving heartland American story still works.  And thanks to cutting edge technology, it's better than ever.

I've watched it twice over the years and continue to be amazed by the utterly mediocre quality of the picture.  If I wanted such poor quality, I might as well watch a butchered-up version on tv.  That is why I was so overjoyed to discover a new edition to be released this August.  As this is one of my 10 favorite films and a film that continues to bring warm memories of my childhood, as I originally saw the film at age 13 with my father, I had hoped for years for a new release of this film.  I will be purchasing it on Blu-ray.
This film case out duting a wonderful time of movie epics that we will never see again (at least without the use of CGI.)  I remember walking down Broadway in Manhattan with my parents in 1962.  At the Criterion theater ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" the Demille ""The Longest Day,"" the Loews State ""Mutiny on the Bounty.""  A few months later at the Cinerama ""How the West Was Won.""  This was followed by ""Its a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World.""  Yes those were great days.
For years I was always puzzled by the great John Wayne's relatively small role in my favorite western.  I was advised by someone in the know that  this was due to the Dukes wanting to work with John Ford on the civil war segment and this was the only real role in that segment that the Duke was well-cast for.

158596,3,0792839072,"It is very difficult to review this film, because it is really five mini-films by three different directors.
Specifically,  Henry Hathaway directed  three of the story segments - ""The Rivers"", The Plains"" and ""The Outlaws"", John Ford directed ""The Civil War""  and George Marshall directed ""The Railroad"".
They are three fine directors to be sure and each is well-known for their films in the western genre, but because each has a somewhat different style, the movie seems too disjointed.
The common thread that ties all of these stories together is the Prescott family who venture west at the beginning of the story and meet with triumph and tragedy all along the way.  The film tells the major stories of the settling of the west through the eyes of three generations of the Prescott family.
While I have given the film a 3 star rating overall, that really does not tell the whole story since I would rate some segments significantly higher than others.
My favorite segments are ""The Rivers"" and ""The Railroad"", followed closely by ""The Plains"".  I found those segments to be well-done and believable.
I was not, however,  particularly impressed with the ""The Civil War"" or ""The Outlaws"" - to me they seemed much less credible and somewhat corny.
Overall, I would recommend the film because it does a reasonable job of telling the tale of the settling of the American west in the time alloted, but do not expect perfection or continuity in this film.",1206316800,4,1451,4.830645161290323

158611,5,0792839072,"How The West Was Won is an impressive, multi-star, Cinerama spectacular, almost three hour epic, western movie.

The movie brilliantly depicts three generations of various members of the American pioneering Prescott family, as they begin traveling westward from New York, via the Erie Canal down some rather rough waters on the Ohio River, across the old western frontier and on to California.

Shown are everything from fur trappers, like the great Jimmy Stewart, to the gold rush era, buffalo stampeding as though they are going to crash through the screen.

The U.S. Civil War is strikingly demonstrated with John Wayne as rugged General Sherman, leading the Union to victory at the ferocious, blood stained battle of Shiloh. Narrator, Spencer Tracy: [speaking about the Civil War] ""After Shiloh, the South never smiled.""

The monumental undertaking of building the transcontinental railroad is a sight to see, coupled with the dusty wagon trains and hostile Indians, plus a few scenes of lousy treatment the American Indians received at the hands of unscrupulousness, ruthless land grabbing rouges and many of the railroad men. One railroad builder, Richard Widmark, always great in westerns, plays Mike King, who although a hard man of the West, finally sees the light in one respect, and says the Indians are getting ""railroaded.""

This diverse western drama also includes riverboat men, high rolling gamblers, and of course quick draw gunmen plus low life outlaws like Eli Wallach.

Each evolving adventure, spanning from the 1830's through the 1890's, is shown as tragedy separates the Prescott's in stunning, sweeping panoramic history lessons, of how America's wild West was eventually explored and settled, while always focusing on the trials and tribulations of the separated members of the Prescott family.

When this motion picture was released on February 20th, 1963, it was distributed only to Cinerama movie theaters (semi-wrap-around wide screen), thus drawing very large crowds due to the edge-of-your-seat, roller-coaster-ride feeling the amazed audience got while watching big budget pictures filmed in the then, state-of-the-art tri-projection Cinerama process.

The crisp, big screen photography vistas seen in this western masterpiece are simply breathtaking.

The other paramount reason the public flocked to see this picture was the all star cast of very famous actors and actresses: John Wayne, James Stewart, Gregory Peck, Richard Widmark, Henry Fonda, Raymond Massey, George Peppard, Robert Preston, Eli Wallach, Carroll Baker, Andy Devine, Walter Brennan, Debbie Reynolds, Jay C. Flippen, and even Lee Van Cleef who played a cold blooded as always, uncredited, river pirate.

This epic film offered something for everyone's movie going preference in leading men and ladies of the early 1960's.

A motion picture living legend narrated this fine film, Mr. Spencer Tracy. ""The West, it had to be won from nature and from primitive man.""

Mr. Alfred Newman. one of Hollywood's greatest musical conductor's beginning was chosen to produce triumphant thundering score. Mr. Newman won more Oscars for musical scoring of movies than any other composer in the history of the Academy Awards, a total of (9)! MGM picked the right man.

A historical sample of over 250 orchestral suites Mr. Newman either directed or conducted, placed him at the top of his profession.

Here is a very short listing: The Grapes of Wrath (1940), I Cover the Waterfront (1933), Wuthering Heights (1939), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939),The Song of Bernadette (1943), A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (1945), Call Northside 777 (1948), Twelve O'Clock High (1949), The Robe (1953), The King and I (1956), The Diary of Anne Frank (1959), The Greatest Story Ever Told (1965), Firecreek (1968) and Mr. Newman last movie score being Airport (1970).

How The West Was Won is massive screen pure Americana. If possible always best viewed in the breathtaking original format of Cinerama. Reportedly there are two remaining Cinerama theaters in America. One is listed as being in Hollywood and the other Dayton, Ohio.

I just wanted to comment on all the criticism of the film to DVD transfer. Lighten up!

I saw this film in a grand theater on a deeply curved Cinerama screen when it was released in the early 1960s.
It was a phenomenal experience.  The young folks who complain about the vertical lines have a point
but they are forgetting that they are looking at a short-lived, experimental technology developed in 1952!

Superior anamorphic lenses and bigger format film ultimately made the 3 camera/3 projector Cinerama
process unnecessary to capture wide screen spectacles.

Widescreen TVs are 16:9 aspect ratio.
Full blown 3 screen Cinerama almost 3:1.
There are going to be black bars on the top and bottom of an HDTV no matter what.

No, Cinerama doesn't compare to today's IMAX technology or Ultra High Def TV which most people haven't even seen yet.  But so what - there's a big story going on here in HOW THE WEST WAS WON.
At least it exists in some form that we can enjoy at home - even if the technical quality of the transfer leaves something to be desired.

It would cost a fortune to digitally correct it for DVD and I doubt that it could be made perfect considering the multitude of variables involved and the long length of the film.

Technicalities aside, it's still a very worthwhile film and much better by far than most of what Hollywood is grinding out today.

The brassy, overblown acting of Robert Preston grated on me. I expected him to leap any moment into a Music Man song. The plot was awful and dull.

But worse than anything was the absolutely cheesiest screen appearance on DVD. It looked just like you are at a drive-in theater with three dirty movie screens pushed together with no attempt to hide the awful un-matched color and exposure on each one.

158618,3,0792839072,"How the West Was Won seems to become more of an endurance task every year. While it throws in everything - injun attacks, shooting the rapids, stampedes, train wrecks, the Civil War, wagon trains - except a good old fashioned gunfight, the characterization and linking narrative wrapped around Richard Talmadge's impressive action scenes are a long way from the best of the West. Whether it's Karl Malden, Carol Baker, Robert Preston or Gregory Peck hamming it up or Debbie Reynolds raising yet another ruckus in another painfully gratuitous musical number, the squirm factor is high. Although John Ford's Civil War section (aided by plentiful stock footage from Raintree County) is the best remembered, the film doesn't really pick up until Reynolds is sidelined out of the picture and George Marshall takes over the directorial reins for the impressive railroad section, where it really starts to confront a few of the darker aspects of the price of progress and allows George Peppard, Richard Widmark and Henry Fonda to shine. Unfortunately by then fatigue is beginning to set in, and for all the beauty of the color the transfer from three-panel Cinerama to letterboxed DVD on the original release left the film with some very jarring distortion problems that leaves much of the film looking like it's being played in a semi-circle. And the film's exultant ending that sees the magnificent scenery buried under miles of highways and skyscrapers now seems more tragedy than triumph. At the end of the day it's pure popcorn fodder, but it has its moments and Alfred Newman's score at least has the dynamism that the majority of the film lacks.

As others have mentioned, the quality of the disc left quite a bit to be desired but WHV's 2008 three-disc DVD is something of a mixed blessing. Thanks to some very impressive digital restoration work the infamous lines between the three screens are almost completely invisible in all but a few shots, though there's still some distortion that comes from presenting a film intended for a curved screen in a horizontal format (not a problem for the Blu-Ray edition, which includes a `smileboxed' version not available to regular DVD buyers). While the film for the most part looks great, the extras are definitely lacking. Pride of place goes to 93-minute documentary Cinerama Adventure which covers the history of the format in depth and the making of How the West Was Won in passing - not stinting on the problems the format gave actors - but for some reason the other Cinerama `story' film, The Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm, is all but completely ignored. While the new audio commentary on the main feature is welcome, the featurette about the making of HTWWW from the previous issue featuring copious amounts of home movie footage from the set has been dropped and only the general release trailer has been included (even though the roadshow trailer heralding Cinerama as the greatest step forward in the evolution of film is still missing, despite clips being used in Cinerama Adventure.

158621,3,0792839072,"[I wrote this DVD review of ""How the West Was Won"" a while ago, but I have added this paragraph to account for a third DVD, released 22 May 2007, as part of a set called ""The John Wayne Collection.""  This third DVD by Warner is the same as MGM's 1998 release.  There has been no DVD re-mastering effort.  All three DVDs have precisely the same content, and so all the information within my following review about the 2000 Warner release can be applied to ""The John Wayne Collection"" DVD of Warner in 2007.  Of special importance is how it wrongly states the disc is an anamorphic DVD.  It is not anamorphic.]

There are two [three] DVDs of ""How the West Was Won"" (1962) available in the U.S.

MGM Video's earlier disc (released on 28 July 1998) and Warner Video's second disc (released 12 Sept. 2000) [and Warner's third disc of 22 May 2007] have EXACTLY THE SAME DISC CONTENT!  Even the menus are the same!  They both contain the film's theatrical trailer and contain the same ""Making Of"" documentary with a run time of 15:30.  The only difference is the earlier MGM release also includes an 8-page booklet with large essays filling all but the cover pages, including a section about the ""800 pounds"" of Cinerama camera equipment used for this spectacle; that plus a plastic DVD box.  The later Warner release uses the cardboard case, but even its cover art does not match the disc menu screens as does the earlier MGM release.

This movie with its Cinerama glory deserves a place on the shelf of video collectors involved with American cinema culture.  If one wants to buy this movie on DVD, opt for the earlier edition with the booklet.  I noticed the DVDs (having the same exact imagery) have four negatives: the extremely wide screen image is only letterboxed and not anamorphic DVD, the theatrical 7-track audio has been degraded to 4-channel matrix-encoded Dolby audio, the DVD picture image suffers from film scratches and dirt, and Ted Turner's logo appears BETWEEN the prologue overture and the beginning of the film.  Nevertheless, the great music is worth the price, alone.  I was never a fan of the movie, but it was one of the single most ambitious film projects ever and cost a fortune!  This film is a crucial landmark of a cultural evolution in American cinema and any collector serious about American film culture needs this DVD.  Of course, the great John Ford directed one segment, but also the famous Henry Hathaway and George Marshall directed their segments of this film.

An interesting part of the documentary focuses on the ideas and investments behind the three-camera Cinerama format and three-screen Super Cinerama theater used for this film.  Despite the success, only two fictional films used the three-, angled-screen Cinerama format: this movie and ""the Wonderful World of the Brothers Grimm"" (1962), the George Pal stop-motion extravaganza.  Cinerama was next re-formulated into a single camera process for a curved screen using a 65mm image on Ultra Panavision 70 film, and these newer camera processes weighed a lot less than the original Cinerama cameras.  The first film made in the latter process was a comedy, ""It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"" (1963) and, according to that DVD, the carpet had been laid in the first of the new single curved-screen Super Cinerama theaters only three days before this comedy's release.  The re-formulated Cinerama/Ultra Panavision 70 cameras were so light, Director John Frankenheimer had them mounted onto Formula Three racecars (dressed as Formula One cars) for his 1966 film, ""Grand Prix.""

The most critically acclaimed and remembered film made for Cinerama three-screen OR curved-screen theaters was ""2001: a Space Odyssey"" (1968).  Read Roger Ebert's website reviews of this movie.  Both, Ebert's original review from 1968 and the review from its re-release of 1997 appear on his website.

Movies made before 1952 were predominantly black and white.  Because studios blamed theater ticket sale diminishment on television, film studios either invented new technologies or reinvented existing ones such as Cinerama, which at least appears very similar to Abel Gance's use of three camera images during the battle scenes of his 1927 silent epic, ""Napoleon.""  Some of the fads blossoming during the `50s and `60s and remaining today are the use of Cinemascope anamorphic lenses, wide-screen panoramic films, color photography, epic plots, large-budget movies, multi-track stereophonic audio, and other artistic special effects.  Some of the fads not quite permanent were stop motion animation like the works of Ray Harryhausen, loud musicals, ""3-D"" movies, and Cinerama.

However, some ideological remnants of the Super Cinerama remain with another distant format: IMAX.  Both processes use curved screens about 110-feet wide although an IMAX screen is dome-shaped because it is twice as high, they both use at least 6 discrete tracks of audio, and they both use theaters specifically designed for exhibitions using their processes.

One of Cinerama and IMAX's fundamental differences is that IMAX's fictional movies are usually transferred from pre-existing wide-screen movies into the IMAX format whereas, unlike IMAX, the fictional movies in Cinerama were made FOR their Super Cinerama theaters.  For instance, the IMAX production of ""Apollo 13"" cropped the original Super 35 film images having a length-to-width ratio of 2.39:1 down into a ratio of 1.66:1 enlarged, according to Ebert's website.  Although ""How the West Was Won"" was mostly shot in its system of three images, some of it was actually shot in Ultra Panavision 70, the second Cinerama format, and optically converted into three-image Cinerama, according to Widescreen Review's website.  This means that, even when Cinerama originally meant three screens, it still utilized Ultra Panavision 70 photography for part of ""How the West Was Won,"" the first of the two fictional films using three-screen Super Cinerama Theaters.

The studio had researched volumes for ""How the West Was Won"" and the Cinerama process, which was one of the many efforts to re-invent the cinema during the 1950s and '60s.  In 1963, when ""How the West Was Won"" released into Cinerama theaters, it was a huge hit and played for nearly two years.

Today, no three-screen Super Cinerama theater remains, and almost all (if not yet all) single-, curved-screen Super Cinerama theaters have vanished.  For the sake of American culture, the government should do something to protect at least one of these theaters.  America needs some history of culture to protect and a Super Cinerama theater seems worth saving since the cinema provides the largest venue of American entertainment today.  The Super Cinerama theater is a landmark of American culture.",1154390400,41,6760,5.124886052871467
158622,4,0792839072,"I'd never heard of cinerama before I saw this movie and the two permanant lines of demarkation and the accompanying distortion of angles bugged me at first.  But after I watched the ""making of"" special feature, all my questions were answered.

Sure it's silly in spots and historically inaccurate in many parts - like the wagon train where every wagon was pulled by horses instead of oxen.  But then oxen drawn wagons running from attacking Indians wouldn't make for much of a chase - a massacre and quick end to the movie would have resulted.  And the shot locations don't always mesh with the storyline - like when Karl Malden bit it on a raft that was supposed to be floating lazily down an Ohio river tributary but magically turned into a Colorado River type whitewater experience complete with mountain backdrop.

But enough of being nitpicky, it's a fun ride the whole way.  I love a movie full of big names even if one or two of them are miscast.  However, my favorite characters are Karl Malden's farmer/father character at the beginning of the film and Thelma Ritter's desperate spinster character later on.  They are both hilarious.

The theme music is wonderful - a Hollywood classic.  Try turning the sound up and sit back and enjoy with your eyes closed during the opening credits.  I also like the ending rendition with lyrics that plays over aerial shots of the modern day west.

If you want a serious western, watch Costner's brilliant ""Dances With Wolves.""  But if a fun ride is what you're in the mood for, you can't miss with this movie.",1152230400,2,1556,4.676470588235294
158623,5,0792839072,"Well, it's July 4th weekend and I decided to put on a bunch of ""Americana"" type stuff. First that came to mind was ""How the West Was Won"". It's loads of fun, and was Oscar winner for Sound and Editing and...er...Best Original Screenplay (?). That silly Academy. Who knows who voted for what back then, or why... Still, it's very entertaining. Acting, I guess was supposed to be hammy, but I did enjoy George Peppard and Carroll Baker. Debbie Reynold had moments of ingenuity, perhaps she was auditioning for ""Molly Brown"" when she made this. Gregory Peck, just off his Oscar win as Atticus, approached Debbie in a love scene like he was still in the courtroom, pleading his case. That was silly, too. Who cares?! I saw this in the Cinerama theatre back in 1963 as a teenager, and I was moved and entertained. One previous reviewer compained about the splicing of the 3 cameras, but it was a small distraction. This version (1998) has a 2.65:1 ratio which shows almost all of the Cinerama screen. Perhaps the wise men at the Academy didn't understand Fellini's ""8 ""; I didn't either, back then. Everyone hated Kazan, so ""America America"" had no hope of winning.  The other nominees were the Italian ""Four Days of Naples"" and the very good ""Love With the Proper Stranger"". Hmm.

158627,4,0792839072,"I don't write many amazon reviews, but some people here are really missing the point.  I saw this movie in the theatre when it first came out.  It opened with all of the fanfare of a ""Cleopatra"" and ""Ben Hur"", and it does belong in that category.  It used an obsolete filming technique, Cinerama, where three cameras to create a wrap around effect.  It was only shown in specially equipped theatres.

It is the story of a single family starting with the father and mother pressing out on the Erie Canal and follows the lives of the children through the years until the end of the Old West.  Epic movies sometimes fail because they take themselves too seriously.  This movie never does that.

First, this is an extremely well known movie, and anyone interested in film must see it.  It won Oscars for story and screenplay.  Secondly, it is a very stirring film and anyone interested in history will be affected by, perhaps quite deeply affected.  It does have problems as a film in the same way that ""Gettysburg"" or ""Gods and Generals"" do.  Perhaps it underplays the drama and expects the audience to understand too much.

It does have a problem with the lines between the three cameras not being seamless.  This was also true in the theatrical release, but I don't remember it being as bad.

158632,5,0792839072,"Though it lacks the austere B&W artistry and thematic complexity of Ford's MY DARLING CLEMENTINE (1946) or Hawks' RED RIVER (1948), the all star HOW THE WEST WAS WON (1963, MGM) may be the most enjoyable western of all time and something wholly suitable for family viewing.  But for heaven's sake get the letterboxed VHS tape or DVD version that does justice to the vast three-strip Cinerama photography.  The pan/scan tape cuts off 60% of the movie!  You can still see where the vertical seam lines are, which someone else here really complained about.  They did not bother me at all and they help explain the fluctuating color within a scene.

James R. Webb's Oscar-winning screenplay is divided into five segments: ""The River"", ""The Plains,"" ""The Civil War"", ""The Railroad,"" and ""The Outlaws.""  The movie employs the talents of three distinguished western filmmakers.  John Ford directed ""The Civil War"", which mostly focuses on the bloody Battle of Shiloh.  George Marshall did ""The Railroad"", about the building of the Transcontinental railroad in the late 19th Century.  And Henry Hathaway directed everything up to the intermission, plus the last segment.  And this baby needed four of Hollywood's best cinematographers:  Joseph LaShelle (THE APARTMENT), Charles Lang Jr. (SOME LIKE IT HOT), William Daniels (Greta Garbo's favorite), and Milton Krasner.  A movie that starts along the Erie Canal in 1830 takes us, over a sprawling and engrossing 165 minutes, to the Pacific Ocean in the 1960's.  It is a stupendous filmmaking achievement.

The cast is just wonderful and full of fun cameos.  But basically we follow the Prescott family over three generations as they marry and move across the continent.  Mom and Dad Prescott (Agnes Moorehead and Karl Malden) drown while river rafting, which is one awesome scene in Cinerama.  Their daughters, Eve (Carroll Baker) and Lilith (Debbie Reynolds) survive.  This may be Baker and Reynolds' finest performances. Eve gets romantically involved with mountain man Linus Rawlings (James Stewart), while Lilith gravitates between wagon train boss Robert Preston and riverboat gambler Gregory Peck.  Intermission.

Eve gets married to Linus, and their son Zeb (George Peppard) fights in the Civil War--and survives to help build the Transcontinental railroad.  We are four-fifths of the way through the almost-three hour movie, with Richard Widmark in a vivid supporting role as an unsympathetic railroad building boss and Henry Fonda as mountain man Jethro Stewart.  A buffalo stampede was filmed in South Dakota and again seems designed for Cinerama.  It comes at you from all sides.

Let's leave part five a secret because I don't want to give away the whole plot, just enough of it to make you want to buy this masterpiece on letterboxed DVD.  I will say that Alfred Newman's music score is maybe his best ever, blended with the evocative Whiskeyhill Singers singing ""Shenandoah,"" the title song, and especially ""Home in the Meadow.""  Debbie Reynolds also does some lovely singing in one of my all-time favorite music scores.  The DVD includes a good fifteen minutes of Newman's glorious roadshow overture, entr'acte, and exit music.

Then there is the final scene, which takes us to the opposite end of the American continent.  It just might be my very favorite final scene in movie history, though THE SOUND OF MUSIC and PEYTON PLACE and CITY LIGHTS are close.  I can watch the WEST ending a hundred times and still get goosebumps (and vertigo) from the greatest pullback shot ever filmed and Spencer Tracy's narration.  The last shot is magnificent  Do buy a wide-screen (again, mandatory) DVD or videocassette of HOW THE WEST WAS WON.  It is one of my ten favorite films of all time and can't be recommended enough.

158633,5,0792839072,"I love the movie, longueurs and all, for John Ford's segment on THE CIVIL WAR makes up for a lot of the movie's shortcomings.  It is sometimes slighted as being among the least of Ford's films, but I like it a lot and never fail to be moved by the poetic distillation of those years of bloodshed and terror.  George Peppard is pretty nmediocre in other parts of the movie but in this sequence he shines, together with young Russ Tamblyn.  Their little duet reminds me of the sadness of Pozzo and Lucky in Beckett's WAITING FOR GODOT.  And beyond them, representing the enlisted men, loom the great generals meeting, John Wayne as Sherman brooding, haunted, late into the night, Harry Morgan as Grant trying to steal the show from the Duke, sorry no chance.  I also enjoy the part where Peppard finally comes home from the war and his poor mother is worn out trying to make ends meet.  It always brings tears to these eyes of mine, tears of identification.  The look on her face is luminous, like one of those black and white photographs of Dust Bowl women by Dorothea Lange, whose influence hangs over the cinematography of HTWWW's quieter and more dignified moments.

In general the movie goes from ebullient and jubilant, filled with adventure and fun, to more somber and reflective moments.  The beginning of the movie has a fair amount of comedy in it, even when Moorehead and Brennan come to grief in a flash flood, the mood is still buoyant--well, it would have to be with Debbie Reynolds always finding something to sing about.  The Civil War and the Reconstruction sequences, and the coming of the Railroad, are grim, grim, grim, and having Carolyn Jones play such a prominent part in the last half is sort of a downer--sorry, Jones fans.  She's a unique and irreplaceable presence in postwar US film, but I think she was wrong for Julie.

Of course the whole movie is miscast in many ways, but I never found much of a problem with it, except in this one case.  However, imagine a HTWWW filmed even five years later, the cast would have shifted considerably, and probably Ann-Margret would have played Lilith, someone like Terence Stamp would have played Jeb, and Raquel Welch could have played Julie Rawlings, stopping the railroad with her breasts alone.",1124064000,2,2264,4.686868686868687
158634,4,0792839072,"This is not really one story. Instead, it is a collection of loosely related vignettes dealing with America's westward expansion in the 19th century. These little stories involve a number of characters but they are loosely tied to one family. Various people wander in and out of it through the course of the film. Most of the actors are major names but each plays just a small role.

As an example, the opening of the Eerie Canal is briefly spoken of. From there, we get a segue into a group of settlers who want to head west where the land is. They cannot afford transportation along the Mississippi so they build their own rafts. While underway, the meet a mountain man, pirates and another settler family. Throughout the rest of the film, various members of this family will appear in a vignette that directly concerns him or her. This may be about the gold rush in California, the building of the transcontinental railway, dealing with hostile Indians, the Civil War or any one of other bits of western Americana.

The driving force behind this film is the pioneer spirit and a willingness to overcome adversity in order to make a success of one's self. I find the message very edifying especially in this time.

Like many other films of the period, ""How the West Was Won"" was made to directly compete with the burgeoning television audience by presenting a theater experience that could not be duplicated at home.  With stunning locations, exquisitely choreographed wagon train journeys, a thrilling train robbery attempt, and a heart-stopping ride down the rapids, the film gave new meaning to THE BIG SCREEN.

Alfred Newman's score is on-the-mark, breathtakingly assisting the story line of settlers moving west and the dangers/problems they encountered.

As mentioned earlier, the cast is huge, but one can say the Debbie Reynolds carries most of the picture, for her character is pivotal to the story developments and she is seen throughout the film's running time.

Also, character acting legend Thelma Ritter gets a chance to get in a few well-placed sarcastic ""zingers"" that she delivered so well in her long and respected career.

The featurette includes stuntman Loren Janes reflecting on the contribution that he and others of his craft made to the making of this film.

The main complaint, as mentioned by other reviewers, is that the print from which this DVD was transfered is not the best.  A movie of this magnitude deserves a ""restored"" version with clearer picture and less ""squiggles"".

In addition to the aforementioned shortcoming, the DVD widescreen presentation is unable to reproduce the CINERAMA experience, yielding scenes where characters, though obviously in the scene, were not visible to the viewer, with only their voices being heard or parts of their bodies being visible.

Moreover, the film's producers should have been aware of a changing America and, at least, inserted some people of color somewhere in the film.  Fleeting glimpses of Chinese train workers are shown but not enough to show their contributions to the development of the West.

Of course, Native Americans are portrayed in the typical manner of the past, either as hollering marauders descending on ""hapless"" settlers or ignorant ""savages"" fascinated by ""civilized"" technology.

And buffalo are shown but no BUFFALO SOLDIERS!",1117411200,,2220,5.2727272727272725
158636,2,0792839072,"This is a movie in which I have a true love/hate relationship.  I first saw it as a child in Philly when it first came out, a family event in going to the movies. Even then, I was engrossed in the images and in the music (I'm a classical musician).

As an adult, I have come to realize that the script is one of the worst in a major movie (some lines are completely incoherent or completely cliche and dialogue flow that makes no sense).  Many plot devises are of B-movie caliber; Its amazing that the script won the Oscar that year! And, of course, there's Debbie Reynold's music numbers...

The film has an all-star cast--many of the greats of Hollywood.  Most of them are giving embarressing performances--as if they just phoned it in--or getting into cliche stereotype performances to capture the cliche western figure they represent.

And the last segment--glorifying the urbanization and modern destruction of much of the land--well, that was done prior to any type of environmental awareness and is hoot to watch today.

With all of this, this movie stongly effected me (as a child) with western images that really stuck.  The combination of cinematography (Cinerama problems, not withstanding) and great music (Debby Reynolds, notwithstanding) is still strong.

If only they could have had a real, authentic story about westward expansion--with real characters instead of cliches.",1111276800,5,1388,5.0
158637,3,0792839072,"By the late 1950s, everyone had a television, and they were staying home to watch it, rather than going out to the theater.  Movie attendance was way down from what it had been in the 1940s.  Moviemakers tried various gimmicks to make theater attendence an ""event"" and thereby draw people out of their living rooms and into movie theaters.  One of these gimmicks was Cinerama, which was a type of widescreen presentation that wrapped around the audience on the edges of the screen.  The process used three cameras and three projectors to achieve the effect.  At first, only travelogs were shot using the 3 camera process, but someone had the idea to shoot a feature film.  So they approved a big budget (at the time) of $15,000,000, and gathered a cast of thousands, including some of the biggest names in Hollywood, including Henry Fonda, Jimmy Stewart, Debbie Reynolds, Richard Widmark, John Wayne, etc.

You need to see this in a Cinerama theater to really appreciate it.  Although there are many good performances in the movie, it feels gimmicky.  First of all, the seams between the cameras are very obvious.  Throughout the movie, you will see two vertical bars dividing the screen real estate into three tracts.  Also, because TV has a flat screen, and the middle panel is not recessed as it was in Cinerama, some of the action close to the camera in the middle panel jumps out, freakishly, at the viewer.  There are also dots and scratches galore.  Obviously, no attempt was made to digitally clean up the film.

Moreover, it feels like the film's plot was made to be the servant of the action sequences it wanted to show off using the Cinerama process.  There's a trip down the rapids on a raft, an indian charge on a wagon train, a wagon race away from the indians, a buffalo stampede, and a running gunfight on a train.  All of this was designed to be viewed in a Cinerama theater, giving the audience a thrill ride that simply could not be matched at home in front of small (probably black and white) Television.  So, I can appreciate why this was a big event movie in 1962.  And you can understand why it is not quite an event as a DVD watching experience in 2005.  Nevertheless, the characters and story were interesting enough that, I must admit, I watched the whole movie.",1107820800,3,2288,4.632754342431761

So they can heap costly CGI and other special effects junk on us in crappy new films, but they can't erase and color correct some glitches from a 1962 film? Yikes! They didn't even bother to clean off the old pops and scratches, either. I guess this shows that Warners has NO respect for those stars who toiled for many decades to virtually make their studio what it is today.

158640,5,0792839072,"Before getting to the review proper... The Blu-ray of this film, made from the camera negatives, with the three panels (almost) seamlessly spliced together, is nothing short of jaw-dropping. It simply looks better -- far better -- than it does in the theater. (Ignoring, of course, the impact of a huge image on a huge screen.) The included Smilebox version makes better use of the screen's area, and presents the film in a way that is subjectively more like Cinerama presentation -- it better stimulates one's peripheral vision. It's highly recommended.

In a remarkable coincidence, the same day I saw ""How the West was Won"" at the Seattle Cinerama (03/01/03), the History Channel aired a program on the history of the wheel. One of the talking-head experts opined that the wheel's invention marked a fundamental change in human thought -- not only was there a technological solution to every problem, but nature could be bent to human will, forced to reveal her secrets and serve us.

This is the theme of ""How the West was Won."" It starts with the title, and extends to nearly everything in the film. The narration tells us that the land had to be wrested from nature and from the ""primitive people"" who inhabited (and by implication, infested) it. The chorus is continually singing about how ""we're headed for the promised land"" and those who are willing to work hard will be richly rewarded (except the Chinese railroad laborers, of course). We were justified in overrunning the continent because we are actually ""doing something"" with it -- as opposed to the Indians, who merely lived there in harmony with nature. Not having invented the wheel, they saw no further possibilities.

James Webb's script <does> acknowledge the culture clash between the Americans and the native peoples, recognizing that the latter will have to eventually change or be destroyed. But this is peripheral to the celebration of the industry, hard work, and sacrifice of the Americans, who ""tamed"" the wilderness. The film ends with a nausea-inducing flyover of the California freeways (I sat next to a guy who'd taken Dramamine in anticipation of such scenes), followed by a flight under the Golden Gate bridge, firmly and unambiguously driving the point home.

""How the West was Won"" is social propaganda, plain and simple. It's the kind of film that could change Osama Bin Laden's mind about destroying the US. (Maybe the State Department could arrange a screening...)

As a movie, there's no denying ""How the West was Won"" is wildly entertaining. Simply as cinematic spectacle, it works magnificently. There are films (such as ""2001"" and ""Lawrence of Arabia"") that even the finest video transfer cannot do justice to, and this is one of them. Sitting in the first few rows, you're so close to the screen that you can't take in all of it at once. When the camera tracks into a scene, the sense of physical motion is uncanny. (Can you say ""stimulation of peripheral vision""? Sure you can.) And if you haven't seen a buffalo stampede, or a train crash, or a row of cannons firing in sequence on a (roughly) 30' by 90' screen -- well, you haven't lived, cinematically-wise.

Story-wise, there's so much material to cover the script cannot begin to do it justice, even in a film lasting 2 hours. Characters are more types than individuals, and almost every performer is cast to type. (Eli Wallach, in particular, gets to do his ""crazy Mexican outlaw"" shtick, though without an accent.) It's only the efficiency and focus of the script that keeps the actors from looking altogether foolish. Other than (perhaps) Karl Malden, no one gives what would be considered a ""real"" performance.

The plot (which follows the Prescott family and its descendents over 50 years) is concocted to make Debbie Reynolds' character the sort of farm girl who wants to run off to the big city to become rich, so we're treated to several (mercifully brief) song-and-dance numbers. Her sister is played by Carol Baker, who falls head over heels in love with Jimmy Stewart's ""aw-shucks"" mountain man, and later ""tames"" him (as the film's conceit requires). The rest of the film rehashes just about every clich of westerns and Civil War movies -- though entertainingly. The final sequence posits the ""conquest"" of the West as occurring when ""the law"" (in the form of George Peppard's marshal) arrives, to establish justice. But Peppard -- who says he wants to bring the bad'un to justice in court -- shoots him to death, anyway.

My five-star rating acknowledges this is a classic film -- not necessarily a great one.

I can't pass up the opportunity to trash Pauline Kael, who was not so much a hard-nosed-but-movie-loving critic as she was an empty-headed, loudmouthed [female canine]. Note how she uses the artistic limitations of a single sentence to craft a thoughtful, insightful commentary that will help the reader better understand this film...

""'How the West Was Lost' would be a more appropriate title for this dud epic, since, as conceived by the writer, James R. Webb, the pioneers seem to be dimwitted bunglers who can't do anything right.""

Hello? Were we watching the same movie? ""How the West was Won"" might be politically incorrect, dramatically shallow, and little more than agit-prop -- but it's no dud. The Seattle audience -- which included many people sporting ""No Iraq War"" buttons -- just ate it up. ""How the West was Won"" is Hollywood middlebrow-populist entertainment at its best.

One final question... Where did they find a stunt man who looked like Agnes Moorhead?",1088380800,8,5552,4.926203208556149
158641,1,0792839072,"I kind of figured television was responsible for this... movie.  HOW THE WEST WAS WON dvd comes with a featurette on the making of the movie, in which we learn that the movie studios developed the Cinerama process (three cameras shot the movie which was projected onto three specially designed screens.  Think IMAX) to present an alternative ""viewing experience"" to compete with television.
 Watching this on television, even in a letterbox edition, is excruciating.  There are visible bars where the three screens meet.  Often the color in one screen doesn't jibe with that of the adjoining screen.
 Those defects could be corrected by digital manipulation, I suppose, but what's the point?  The Cinerama screen was meant to wrap around the audience and a television screen is flat.  What can't be corrected is the lack of close-ups and a surplus of dead space.
 Almost all the action takes place in the center panel, and the closest we get to the action is in a medium shot.  Most of the time there's nothing happening on the edge panels. Two-thirds of the screen is dead.  The only time Cinerama seemed to shine was when chaotic action was swiftly coming at the audience, which is why we are so often treated to onrushing trains and galloping horses and stampeding buffalo shot from a camera in the ground.  I think it would have taken a visual genius the likes of a Busby Berkeley to exploit Cinerama's potential without having to open the paddock.
 The featurette also tells us HTWWW had a cast of 12,000.  I guess maybe a dozen of them weren't miscast, but that's just a guess.  The movie opens with Jimmy Stewart, out of character as mountain man Linus Rawlings, canoeing along a river while Spencer Tracy narrates over the action: `(The land) known only to the lonely trappers wandering its vastness in search of beaver...' One and a half scenes later Linus skids his bark next to the Prescott campsite and gives Carroll Baker a pelt to stroke....
 Okay.  I was bored.  What can I say?  At least I was paying attention.  When Debbie Reynolds delivers a rousing rendition of  `Raise a Ruckus' for the despondent members of the wagon train I wasn't paying much attention at all.  By the time Eli Wallach was glaring daggers at George Peppard's kids I was wondering whether or not one should fill in that little hole in the middle of a dvd when you make it into a coaster.",1087084800,21,2377,4.690821256038648
158642,2,0792839072,"I like westerns. My favorite entries in the genre are spaghetti westerns, those cheap, ultra low budget Italian takes on the American West. I always try to fit some of these movies into my viewing schedule, and when the day came where I considered it time to watch Sergio Leone's epic ""Once Upon a Time in the West,"" I headed out to rent it. Imagine my surprise when I got home and saw that I inadvertently checked out ""How the West Was Won"" instead. I scratched my head, not familiar at all with the title. After all, I like westerns but I don't know a lot about the genre or the films I have yet to see. When I saw the cast list for this 1962 movie, I decided not to take it back without watching and seeing if I liked it. I think I would be remiss to have skipped this one on initial impression alone; the cast list reads like a ""who's who"" of mid twentieth century Hollywood. You've got Carroll Baker, Lee J. Cobb, Agnes Moorehead, Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, George Peppard, Debbie Reynolds, Eli Wallach, John Wayne, Richard Widmark, Walter Brennan, Karl Malden, Carolyn Jones, Harry Morgan, Raymond Massey, and Robert Preston filling the roles. Spencer Tracy voices the narration. Howard Hawks and John Ford directed specific segments of the film. What a list of talent! Couldn't go wrong with a movie like this one, right? Wrong.
As amazing as it seems, ""How the West Was Won"" is not a very good experience. The movie runs for an eternity as it attempts to describe the different experiences in settling the American West. At the beginning of the film, the Prescott clan heads out to the West in search of farmland and a new beginning. Zebulon Prescott (Karl Malden), his wife Rebecca (Agnes Moorehead), and two daughters Eve (Carroll Baker) and Lilith (Debbie Reynolds) travel down the recently completed Erie Canal and travel out into what Illinois or Missouri. Along the way, they encounter a traveling fur trapper named Linus Rawlings (Jimmy Stewart), who stays with the family for a day or so, just long enough to fall in love with one of the daughters. After Zeb and Rebecca perish in an unfortunate rafting accident, Rawlings reemerges to take care of Eve and eventually establish a farm at the sight of the accident. These two will have children-one named Zebulon Rawlings (George Peppard)-who will eventually fight in the Civil War. Zeb Rawlings then leaves the family property to his brother as he moves further west fighting Indians for the railroads and working as a law officer. He ends up thwarting a nasty train robbery in Arizona some fifty years after his grandparents expired on that raft.
The other daughter, Lilith, ends up in St. Louis working as a dancer and actress when she learns that she inherited a gold mine in California. As she prepares to head west, a slick card shark named Cleve Van Valen (Gregory Peck) convinces Lily to take him along. There's a minor competition for Lily's affections between Van Valen and Roger Morgan (Robert Preston), another guy on the wagon train. The gold mine doesn't pan out in the end, so Lilith and Cleve end up falling in love and marrying, eventually going on to build and lose several huge family fortunes. Of course, Lily's travels to the coast are fraught with perils, such as an Indian attack on the wagon train and a song and dance number at a campsite. I kept hoping the filmmakers would insert a Donner Party type situation that would require Gregory Peck to consume either Robert Preston or Debbie Reynolds, but no such luck. In any event, the movie seems to focus more on the Rawlings clan than it does on Lily's experiences.
Sadly, many of the great actors in the movie rarely appear. Raymond Massey plays Abraham Lincoln, John Wayne and Harry Morgan are General William Tecumseh Sherman and General Ulysses S. Grant respectively, and Lee J. Cobb is a Marshal in Arizona. Even Eli Wallach as an outlaw is a ghostly shadow of the villain he played in Leone's ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly."" The huge cast list highlights the central problem of the film, namely that the filmmakers tried to do too much. Very few of the characters we see receive proper development. The focus here is on shock and awe photography and scenery, not the individuals taking part in the events. ""How the West Was Won"" was the first film shot in Cinerama, and, I think, a prime example of how Hollywood abuses a new technology. We see the same thing going on today with the CGI effects in those top-heavy special effects bonanzas. Everyone wants to use a new cinematic technique, so much so that they rely solely on the effect and lose sight of the human element. A bit less spectacle and a lot more interaction between the cast would have helped this movie succeed.
I hate to say it, but the DVD version of this film could use a lot of work. You can literally see the two lines dividing the picture into three segments in the transfer. Not only is this enormously annoying, it's completely unacceptable. I can't believe the studio techs couldn't release a seamlessly restored version of this film. The disc does contain a short documentary detailing the Cinerama process along with a few bits about the stunts in the film, but the shoddy picture quality of the movie will dampen your enthusiasm for any extras. I imagine some people would like the actual movie better than I did though no one should settle for the poor transfer.

158644,5,0792839072,"HOW THE WEST WAS WON is not only one of my Westerns but is one of my favorite films. Somehow I feel that to really appreciate the scope of this film you probably had to see it on the big screen when you were a kid growing up. It was awe inspiring when I saw it those many years way back when. Even if you didn't see it in true Cinerama, the composite prints were still impressive because you got the three depths of field, which still conveyed the grandeur of the panoramic outdoor vistas of the West as no other process ever, did. The film is a sprawling epic, episodic in structure, but remains one of the great cinematic examples of true Americana. You get a genuine feel of the westward movement of nineteenth century America. This is made greatly possible by Alfred Newman's inspired score, utterly breathtaking cinematography by William H. Daniels, Milton Krasner, Charles B. Lang, Jr. and Joseph LaShelle and screenwriter James R. Webb's earthy dialogue. James Stewart as Linus Rawlings and Henry Fonda as Jethro Stuart have effective and interesting yet separate scenes (the film was divided into five segments) that are linked together by George Peppard as Zeb Rawlings (Stewart's son) in Peppard's telling coming-of-age performance. Stewart's Linus Rawlings is our first contact with a character that embodies the spiriting of winning the West. Fonda's Jethro Stuart seen much latter in the fourth segment gives a reflective performance and ponders on what was really won in the conquering of the West. Debbie Reynolds as Lilith Prescott embodies the romanticism, prosperity and lure of what the West held for those adventurous individuals and dreamers who yearned for what those far off and distant hills held for those with the willing spirit. Russ Tamblyn also has a brief but effective role as a Confederate soldier who shares reflections during the evening with a Union soldier (Peppard) on a riverbank pink with blood from the day's fighting. Also memorable and effective was Spencer Tracy's voice as the Narrator, which tied together the five story segments along with the beautiful prose of the prologue and touching epilogue. For me there are many touching moments in this film about the human spirit and our capacity to want and love. I think this is a great and important film about the American spirit.",1080518400,,2324,4.916030534351145

I've grown up on the movie, but my 24 year old son was seeing it for the first time.  Believe it or not, this was the first time I have seen it in the full, Cinerama (3 strip film) format.  Some people lament that no video transfer can capture the true Cinerama image, and ask MGM to release a  ""proper widescreen"" version.  Being Cinerama, no video release can ever truly capture the ultra-wide screen format of three separate pictures running simultaniously.  I was surprised to see the ""seams"" in it's original format.  In fact, one engineer's sole job during projection is to keep these seams straight!  I noticed that, even in it's original format, there is actually a slight distortion of the image on the very outer edges of the deeply curved screen.  It is no wonder that the various directors correctly kept their actors framed within the center of the screen, leaving the edges (with a few exceptions) for ""fill"" - to expand the screen in an attempt to create the normal range of vision of the human eye.  After HOW THE WEST WAS WON, Cinerama changed to a single lens system primarily because the wide-eyed lenses used for Cinerama could not be used for close-ups, which are consipictiously missing in true Cinerama.  The Cinerama company (and the studios) still wanted the aspect ratio that the Cinerama process achieved, so they went to Super Panavision 70 or Ultra-Panavision.  The problem was that, when these 70mm  films were initially released, the advertising stated that they were presented ""in Cinerama,"" which may have confused patrons who thought they were seeing the original, 3-strip process.  That's why I've always insisted that I saw a ""Cinerama"" version of 2001: A Space Odyssey.  That Kubrick film was not made in true Cinerama but in Super Panavision 70.  As far as the aspect ratio is concerned, the various video transfers of HOW THE WEST WAS WON are probably as good as we can get.",1064620800,9,2011,4.752161383285302

A haunting and poetic music covers it all and the off-screen commentary read by Spencer Tracy, is still worth all the money in the world.
It's pure Americana, pure escapism, but with tons of poetry and beauty. It might not be a history lesson on how the U.S. developed, but it certainly reflects and sums up, some of the values and faults that still pervade American society today.

Peppard makes the strongest impression as Zeb Rawlings, veteran of the Civil War who later serves as the military liaison officer for the railroad, which is moving ever westward.  Reynolds is Lily Prescott who continually overcomes the odds against her and survives into old age.  Other cast members that stand out include Karl Malden as the Prescott family patriarch who begins the family's move west; Carroll Baker as Malden's daughter and Reynolds's sister Dora; and especially Henry Fonda as the practical and durable plainsman Jethro Stuart featured in ""The Railroad"" sequence of the film.
A stampeding buffalo herd that tramples a pioneer settlement under its hooves and a hairy and sensational shootout on a rapidly moving train are the action highlights, but they don't come until the final 25 minutes of the movie.  There are other rousing scenes such as the Prescott's wild ride down the river rapids and a little while later an Indian attack but they come off as fairly routine, having that sense of 'd&eacute;j&agrave; vu' to it.  Reynolds adds some great punch to the film in several musical numbers that she performs periodically throughout, working as a showgirl to support herself in different venues.
Ironically, the Western genre's larger-than-life icon, John Wayne, receives barely five minutes of screen time - and he doesn't even appear as a Westerner.  He plays General Sherman to Henry Morgan's General Grant in ""The Civil War"" sequence of the film.  The entire scene is inconsequential to the rest of the movie, showing the two generals lamenting over their battlefield decisions, which have caused an incredible loss of life at Shiloh.  It serves only to allow Union soldier Peppard to act as a hero, preventing a would-be assassin from taking either of the two's lives.
A major drawback to 'How The West Was Won' is its ethnocentric view of history.  The Native Americans played a huge part in the successful settlement of the Western US but they receive only the standard Hollywood treatment.  Not until the final ""The Railroad"" sequence do they get any substantial screen time, but even so this is for the purpose of establishing Peppard's character as a friend of the Indians, the Arapahos in this case.  One other slight disadvantage is the lack of dramatic continuity, which is due to the film's efforts to provide its big name cast with screen time.
'How The West Was Won' was filmed in a technique that employed three cameras to capture each shot and was presented in theaters that same way.  Unfortunately it doesn't transfer to DVD too well and it is clear to see the seams or separate frames often throughout the film.  To truly appreciate this movie it should be seen on the big screen when possible, it is as visually impressive as many of the Hollywood action oriented mega blockbusters of today.",1038960000,5,3307,4.933333333333334

The restoration of the colors is excellent and though some may complain about the three-camera process, not only are you experiencing a great western, you are also experiencing film processing history. It is unfortunate that Amazon says that the DVD ships in 24 hours. It took them nearly a month to ship it to me.",1038355200,2,414,4.1875
158653,3,0792839072,"The picture of the DVD (and the widescreen VHS video and probably the Laserdisk) are from the Cinemascope version patched together around 1963 or 1964 so the film could be shown in cities without Cinerama 3-projector theatres.  As such the 2.7 Cinerama (or so) ratio was cut down to Cinemasope's 2.35.  As is evident this was not a pan-and-scan job, the center of the picture was transferred.
I theorize that the Dolby Surround sound is a mix from the 4 channel Cinerama print.  Others here state that the mix is different from before so this may not be true.
While I, like the others, would love the see the film restored and sound remized, we must realize that this is all custom format material (film and sound).  The sound could still be easily digitized and remixed (regardless of the print).  However the print would require a lot of custom transfer and editing just to get to the color correction part.  This may not be an economically viable project.
Some artifacts can not be removed: obvious ones like the bent bridges during the closing sequence, plus others that I haven't tought about.
I saw this in Cinerama in Dayton during its brief revival in the late 90's.  The experience was fabulous!",1031356800,,1204,4.704761904761905
158654,5,0792839072,"The 3 projector process (Cinerama) was not the greatest compaired to what we have now. Don't let the reviews cast doubt about buying this wonderful film.  If you saw this in a Cinerama Theatre or watch the DVD the lines will be and would still have been there. That was just the process. For the audience, it was shire pleasure seeing this giant curved wrap-a-round screen of technology. But the sound is another story. In Cinerama the sound was magnetic and offered lots of stereo channels to follow the voices of the cast, special sound effects and the wonderful music score. This part of the transfer did not go well. The voices are in mono and the music is just plain surround. It isn't terrible but with a little more thought this transfer could have been a masterpiece. My only other disappointment is i do not understand especially with a DVD and a menu that tells you what scene is what, why do you have to be told that this is the ""Overture?"" Why can't these roadshows that have and overture just be a black screen when the music is playing. This is basically my only frustration. Never-the-less this film is still worth owning inspite of the flaws. You'll never see a cast like that again. It would also be nice to see the other Cinerama films transferred like ""This is Cinerama"", ""The Best of Cinerama"", The Seven Wonders of the World"" and all the others.

I first saw t on Turner Classic Movies and loved it seeing it in all its glory on DVD was a refreshing experience I highly recomend this film for any fan of Westerns.,1023753600,2,502,4.185567010309279

Do not waste your time or money.  The people who produced this DVD must learn that customers will not accept this kind of rubbish.

158658,4,0792839072,"I remember seeing How the West Was Won at the Cooper Cinerama Theater in Minneapolis when I was in my teens, so for me this was high nostalgia.  I enjoyed the color, the setting, the action, the musical score and the popular stars of my childhood.  Debbie Reynolds was pretty and full of youthful energy;  Gregory Peck was still young enough to be considered handsome; and Thelma Ritter, a popular character actress from the 40s and 50s, was still her curmudgeonly self.  However my husband, who is considerably younger than I, found the plot plodding and predictable, the introduction of song into the story intrusive and manipulative (to quote: ""I can see why musicals died out, and not a minute too soon in my opinion!""), and the mismatched ""screens"" of the cinerama projection method a great disappointment.  I have to admit that the film wasn't quite as impressive in video form as it had been on the big curved screen of the Cooper Theater.
I think more than anything How the West Was Won captures a sense of the time during which the film was first made and enjoyed.  1962, when cinerama was a new ""high tech"" entertainment, was still a time when everything seemed possible.  The adults of middle class USA had the laurels of WWII to bolster their sense of control, and they were still young enough to enjoy life, their families, and their careers.  Now they are most of them in their 70s and 80s, retired, elderly, frail adults no longer in control of their own lives.  In the early 60s, the rebellious youth of the Rock and Roll era were still naive enough to believe that good will and good intentions could fix what was wrong with the world.  Now many of them are themselves older adults, disappointed in the world's unwillingness to be ""fixed,"" concerned about their own future, gradually losing control over the events of which they are a part, and facing a world that changes not yearly or even monthly but weekly and even daily.
Although I know I wouldn't be happy to go back in time to the 1960s, that today in fact is as good as the ""old days"" get, I can't help enjoying a brief visit to those hopeful, energetic, and more innocent times.  Sometimes I just need to get off of the Merry-go-round that high tech life has created.  I have, however, given up on expecting my husband to share my sentiments.  He wasn't there, so he just can't share them.  Definitely more of a film for those who were young in the 60s!",1007769600,5,2430,4.55632183908046
158659,4,0792839072,"This movie is pretty good overall, but still there's minor action, like a few gunfights, one Apache encounter, and so on.  I'm not saying this is bad, but I'm saying: if you really think about it, it's not the best ever made.  For example, ""Chisum"" and ""Stagecoach"", which are both John Wayne movies, have way more action.  Besides, why did Wayne play such a small part in this video?  It would have been much better had he played a longer part.  Also, if you want better movies, there are two ""Stagecoach"" movies.  Watch the John Wayne one, because of the singer in the color movie.  Another example is ""True Grit"", and ""Rooster Cogburn"".  I won't give any more examples, because I wouldn't have a well written review.  But what I can say is that you should watch this movie, and there are better ones, but this is a neat one.  Enjoy!",1003622400,,835,4.470198675496689
158660,3,0792839072,"Summary:  the film is great, the transfer needs serious help.
I had not previously seen the movie, and the first time I saw the DVD version I was getting a little irritated with the bad transfer (especially the all-too-obvious misalignment between the three screens).  I'm glad I sat through it, as the story is impressive and very enjoyable.  It's not for everyone, but if you're into sorta-kinda-historical movies about the early US, this is a great choice.
I'd love to see a digitally-restored version of this, as it wouldn't be too difficult to fix the alignmnent issues.  But I suspect that it would be fairly expensive to do--not only are there three separate pieces of film to have to deal with, but it's a very long movie... and the film has obviously deteriorated quite a bit over the years.
I'll give it three stars just because it's a great movie, but as other folks have pointed out--it's simply not a good transfer.  It's not nearly as bad as some of the really cheap releases (this one's watchable) but some people will definitely be turned off by the vertical lines etc.  Rent it first.",999734400,,1101,4.678756476683938

If you got this video in a pan-and-scan version I feel sorry for you though.  As the first ""Cinerama"" movie shot with a story this video can only be viewed in widescreen.  Due to the age of the movie there are parts that the ""3-frame"" windows are quite obvious.  Don't let the seams distract you from a marvelous story and spectacle of this near classic movie.

158662,5,0792839072,"I saw this picture first at age 11 in 1963. Our 5 th grade class went to see it at the invitation of a pal's dad who worked at MGM. I have seen it a dozen times in theatres big and small, and enjoyed it on network TV, even, surprizingly, on NBC on a dead sports weekend in 1999. I have owned the vhs set for years, and enjoyed it, but this dvd version, purchased 8-01, is the best.
I think it is the spirit of a lost America, the great music, and the photography, not even to mention the greatest cast ever assembled, make this a breathtaking experience. This is a must see for young kids, to see America as it was. What a great movie! The special features are a treat. Get this movie!

158663,5,0792839072,"How The West Was Won is a sprawling three hour epic that was so big it needed three directors (Henry Hathaway, George Marshall & directing legend John Ford) to bring the story to life.  The movie takes us through the early days of western settlement to post civil war days.  The cast is full of Hollywood legends including Jimmy Stewart, Henry Fonda, Karl Malden, Debbie Reynolds and Gregory Peck.  George Peppard and Richard Widmark also have roles. It's fun to see so many stars in one movie, though most of time they don't appear together on screen. One complaint is that the film was the first to be filmed with a three camera method and in certain scenes, you can see seams in the print where the film was spliced together.  That is a minor complaint as the film itself is a compelling story and is beautifully filmed, with lush Old West settings.  The film was a major success and took home two Oscars in 1963, one for screenplay and one for editing.",981417600,8,956,4.502890173410405

Characters are left out of some shots. Complete action not included.  Why!  We purchase wide screen additions specifically for the FULL SCREEN effect  yet many of the scenes are cropped. Parts of the sound track are fuzzy in  tone, too, which distracts from an otherwide great epic.  Why do  manufacturer's do this to us? the technonogy today can correct these  mishaps. Two still photgraphs, one during the Overture and the other during  the intermission music...  Da! Boring shots  any amature could capture.  Why not include the fine art work, the splendid posters that indentified  this great film at the time.  We film buffs want to see How The West Was  Won paraphernalia.  The film is a history lesson in itself which I shared  with my 11 y.o. son. But the concept of such a remarkable film, the story  telling, and the actors that are no longer with us today, deserve a better  version than what this DVD produces.  Yet, again, the film is awesome, and  Alfred Newman's score is dramatic and powerful and beautiful. One of his  best.  I give it 4 stars because of my recollections of a great Cinerma  motion picture. A motion picture event!  It could have been more,  especially on DVD format.",964224000,8,1411,4.703703703703703
158666,4,0792839072,"I just watched the newest release of How the West Was Won.  I was hoping for an improvement over the previous release.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed.  The criticisms of the earlier release remain.  The  imperfection of the three-camera Cinerama process is still very evident.  Like other reviewers, I saw to original 2 -3 times in theaters in the  1960's.  At that time, it was a spectacular widescreen experience and we  ignored the three-frame presentation.  However, now this seems archaic when  compared to today's single-camera widescreen presentations.  It is really  distracting, particularly in outdoor shots.  Even the audio track has not  been updated to take advantage of current home theater systems.  Since  Turner is so proud of the film that it adds its logo at the beginning, you  would think they would be proud enough to remaster the original to make it  more appealing.  They have certainly spent enough to colorize B & W  movies!  However, on a positive note--the Alfred Newman score remains  vibrant, memorable, and superb.  Also, we can be critical of the DVD  transfer, but that is what we saw on the screen almost 40 years ago!  It  remains true to the original theatrical presentation.
