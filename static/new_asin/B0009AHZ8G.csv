8058900,4,B0009AHZ8G,"Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation presents ""DAKOTA LIL"" (1950) (86 min/Color) -- Starring George Montgomery, Rod Cameron, Marie Windsor, John Emery & Wallace Ford

Directed by Lesley Selander

Secret service agent Tom Horn (George Montgomery) is sent West to round up a gang of counterfeiters. He starts by gaining the confidence of dance-hall girl Dakota Lil (Windsor) who, it seems is one of the ringleaders. The charming and under appreciated Windsor makes an excellent good/bad lady. she even gets to sing a couple of songs while masquerading as a saloon singer.  She, in turn, leads Horn to the brains of the operation, Harve Logan (Rod Cameron).  Cameron is downright nasty as Logan. He plays him as a short-fused psychopath who brutally murders three people by viciously strangling them with a riding strap that he wears around his wrist.  When Lil finds out that Horn is a Fed, she's tempted to fill him full of holes; instead, having fallen in love with him, she tries to help him get the goods on Logan.  . Montgomery is rather one dimensional as the hero but it must have been difficult to play against Cameron's villain.

Great western with George Montgomery squaring of against fellow cowboy heavyweight Rod Cameron

""Dakota Lil"" though not a great western is nonetheless a feast for the eyes and a chance to see Rod Cameron on the wrong side of the law for a change.
