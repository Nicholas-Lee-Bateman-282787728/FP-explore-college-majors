8597051,5,B000HIVIHO,"First off, the video quality may not be the best on this DVD, but it is one of the most real feeling music dvd's out there.

Seven Witches was in top form during this show.  Everything just clicks.  If you are a fan of American Heavy Metal, or European Power Metal, you're are going to like the set of songs played here.  There are songs here from all of their albums, with a few highlights including ""Camelot"", ""Metal Tyrant"", ""Apocalyptic Dreams"", ""Johnny"" and many others.

This is a must have for fans.  Its a close up, in your face romp through an awesome set, plus you can see me while you're watching it. I'm the fat guy in the front, right around the center wearing a Powerslave T-Shirt.",1167868800,4,695,4.390625
