8678891,5,B001PR02A0,"I cannot agree with the previous review, and I would stress to that gentleman he watch the film a few times through.  I've found that the film's magnificence fully reveals itself upon the third and even forth viewing.  It's a film with fine acting, substantial visual design, and a compelling story that may at first disturb, or confuse, but over time proves itself as overwhelming in its penetrating subtlety.

This filmmaker has a future.  I can't wait to see what he does next.",1263340800,,480,4.746987951807229
8678892,1,B001PR02A0,This movie was pretty much unwatchable.  I tried but couldn't actually get through the entire movie.  It reminded me of a poor version of a cable movie.  I am interested in both the topic of running and eating disorders and was very disappointed with the overall story.  The characters lacked depth and the story lacked any real convincing meaning.,1235347200,,348,4.8474576271186445
