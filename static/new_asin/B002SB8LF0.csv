Selling it for 18 bucks for one 12 minute segment is nuts.  I wanted to purchase it, but I hope to find it somewhere else.",1336176000,4,254,3.8653846153846154
8379258,5,B002SB8LF0,"This is one of the most breathtaking videos I have ever watched, and as a former parachutist I found it totally fascinating. I bought the DVD after replaying this episode on my DVR several times. The scenery is unbelievable and the base jumping will give you goose bumps. The HD picture is fantastic on a big screen.",1264032000,,316,4.56140350877193
8379259,5,B002SB8LF0,The footage on this dvd is excellent and watching this story on dvd is much better than a TIVO replay.  As for the flying these guys do and the Norwegian landscape . . . both are best described with superlatives.,1261958400,,212,4.3
