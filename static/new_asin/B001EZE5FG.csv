According to the specs, still no ""Return Of The Pink Panther"".",1220400000,3,83,5.0

3558581,5,B001EZE5FG,This is the best seller to work with!!!  There was alot of confusion with the order and everything was beyond my expectations!!!!!  The collection is great for movie nights with the kids and has everything Pink Panter.,1390176000,,218,4.864864864864865
3558582,5,B001EZE5FG,"I bought it.  It's fantastic.  I took the Inspector Clouseau one and doubled it back to back with Son of the Pink Panther, and in its slot put Return of the Pink Panther.  And then bought Pink Panther 2 with Steve Martin, and that in with the slot with the first Pink Panther wit Martin and now have the set complete.  I am very happy I bought this, it is complete, with the cartoons too.  ^_^",1368835200,,393,4.118421052631579

3558584,5,B001EZE5FG,"This set came in good condition, It a little tricky in removing the dics from the selves that they come in, but can be done. the video on my 55' television looks good, not all movies are in 5.1 sound, but still seem pretty good on my Bose 3.2.1 . The book is coffee table size, so you do need someplace to keep the oversize set. Because of movies rights, one movie is missing, but can be brought by it self frome amazon. It would had been nice to have this set done for blue ray.",1362787200,,479,4.0
3558585,5,B001EZE5FG,"I liked this Collection because not only does it come with the Pink Panther Film Collection it also comes with ""The Inspector Cartoons"", ""Roland and Ratfink"" and ""The Ant and the Ardvark"".

3558588,5,B001EZE5FG,"This is the most elegant collection of Pink Panther Movies and Cartoons ever assembled! I have just one thing to say, why isn't this item on BluRay yet ? Or maybe that process takes longer to produce. By any means I love the packaging and the collection, which was painstankingly put together, Thank You. I enjoy these movies and cartoons and even watch with my kids. Classic clean comedy rules, like the above collection and Three stooges,Chaplin,Laurel & Hardy,etc.
Again just a great product.",1349481600,,495,4.904761904761905
3558589,1,B001EZE5FG,"I got myself this collection since pink panther was one of my fav. cartoons as a kid and i still love it as an adult just as much.
The reason i gave it a one star is because of the bad packaging , almost all dvds were scratched and one of them was scratched like nothing ive ever seen before, it wouldnt even start...
Thats about it i guess , one of the best things ever wasted by bad packaging.",1347408000,3,395,3.95
3558590,5,B001EZE5FG,Great collection. Only problem is getting the CD's out of the sleeves withot scratching them.  Other than that is a great collection.,1342396800,,133,5.045454545454546
3558591,5,B001EZE5FG,"Seller delivered item as promised, and fast.  Item was better than I thought it would be.  Oh, and this item is really big and heavy.  The pictures don't really convey how big it is.  Great seller, will buy from again.",1334102400,,218,4.375
3558592,4,B001EZE5FG,"This is my first review. I know a lot of us work & have no time to shop for things in stores this said
we think we get the best deals on Amazon or other sites. well I did happen to have time to get out
& what do I find the same Collection of the pink Panther for $ 44.98 @ Sams club. I guess that the
deal I thought was good was not that at all but when you have no time to shop what else are you
to do?",1325289600,,403,3.391304347826087

3558594,5,B001EZE5FG,"I own the Pink Panther 5 movie set and the PP Classic Cartoon Set, as well as Inspector Vol 1 and Ant / Aardvark AND the Steve Martin Version of ""Pink Panther"" as well as ""Return of the Pink Panther"" on a separate DVD.

Now at the time of this writing I got it from a seller at 65 dollars so getting the 5 ""other DVDs"" I don't own was still a great bargain to finish off the set.

The surprise was I also got the hardcover 150 page book which I didn't know came with it and a very large outer case. I got lucky that only 1 DVD fell out and was scratched but it still played perfectly even with about ten scratches. Two of the disks had glue on the edges but came off easily. Those were probably the main reasons the set is now so cheap (assuming).

Definitely worth buying even if you own the other stuff I mentioned at first. The ""addition"" to my collection ""Inspector Clouseau"", ""Son of"", ""Curse of"", ""Roland"", and ""Inspector Vol 2"" makes the whole set complete considering some of those Cartoons that I needed to complete the set are not available elsewhere.

So what it doesnt mention ""Return of the Pink Panther"" openly in the book or the fact that DVD wasn't with the set. Thats not the fault of MGM. Blame Columbia. BTW the book does mention ""Return"" in some obscure pages, but you have to find them.",1323820800,,1307,4.236947791164659
3558595,5,B001EZE5FG,"My kids love it.  This collection included the Pink Panther and company cartoons I watched as a kid, many years ago.  Beautiful color digitalized copy.  The movies are also in the set.  Came packaged in a nice fitted and eye-catching Pink box set.  The two words to describe the set are timeless and classic.  I love it too!",1322352000,,324,4.5
3558596,5,B001EZE5FG,This was such a cool purchase--I love the pink fuzzy case the videos come in.  There are so many Pink Panther items-Cannot wait to view them all--thanx,1318896000,,151,4.592592592592593
3558597,5,B001EZE5FG,I have seen this set for much more than I paid with Amazon and I'm so glad I picked it up when I did.  It was beautifully packaged and will make a great gift for my Dad.  Thank you Amazon,1315958400,,187,3.65
3558598,5,B001EZE5FG,This is an awsome buy.  The cartoons are almost better than the movies. Peter Sellars at his best. Worth owning.,1315008000,,112,4.6
3558599,5,B001EZE5FG,"If anybody had asked me what my favorite movie (or cartoon) was, I would say ""The Pink Panther.""  I would see the show over and over again and still laugh.

3558600,4,B001EZE5FG,"I have yet to actually view the DVD's but I am a fan of Pink Panther movies, especially w/ Peter Sellers, so I am sure I will enjoy them. I can speak, however, on the physicality of the package. Yowsers it is BIG!  Admitedly I don't buy many DVD's let alone ""Ultimate Collections"" so mebbee they're ALL like this. I would have been happier w/ a more compact arrangement. Super deal for the price, though!",1313625600,,404,4.386666666666667
3558601,5,B001EZE5FG,"Absolutely fantastic! While it doesn't have ""Return,"" it is full of awesome material. I am so glad to have had the opportunity to get this. It is an incredibly awesome addition to my movie collection.",1313625600,,200,4.742857142857143
3558602,4,B001EZE5FG,"I purchased this collection on a Deal of the Day, and what a deal it is!  I'm a fan of the Pink Panther series from back in the day and being a girl I was attracted to the fuzzy pink package! If you're young or old, this set is for you!  (Now I can't speak to the fact if you're a die hard fan and are angry because of the omission of a couple movies, but for me...this was a great purchase!) :-)",1313366400,,396,3.7590361445783134
3558603,1,B001EZE5FG,"When Amazon had the deal of the day on this set, I couldn't have been more excited to get it.  However, the first set was delivered with a broken corner of the collector's fuzzy box.  Inside the box, many of the DVDs had fallen out of their slots, and were severely scratched.  I contacted Amazon customer service, which is excellent by the way, and they next day delivered a replacement and paid for me to UPS the original back.

The second collection arrived with a different corner of the collector's box smashed, and more loose, scratched DVDs.  I don't see how this can be avoided, as the poor packaging will never deliver a perfect or even very good collection to your home.

I am going to give up, and return the second set for a refund.  What good is a ultimate collection in a broken box, with scratched DVDs.  It will never hold it's resale value in this damaged condition.",1312329600,3,883,4.475
3558604,3,B001EZE5FG,"+ve very well packaged for shipping - very strong shipping box
+ve beautiful pink panther box
-ve very very heavy and tall pink panther box - hard to find somewhere I can store it.
+ve beautiful book fits in the box and a ribbon to lever the book out... also the 'dvd' storage book fits well too.
-ve the dvds are stored in a book - in cardboard - several dvds to the page.
very -ve -- a very large number of the discs were scratched. some very very scratched.

Now, I bought these on gold box, and given the nature of the storage book, I doubt sending them back will get me a set in better condition. Had I not bought them as a gold box (heavily discounted), and they'd arrived in such an appropriate and sturdy shipping box, I'd be very unhappy....
but as I bought them mainly for the book and the cartoons I'm not going to complain - merely to warn others what to expect. It is a beautiful, very heavy, tall packaged collection... but if you get upset at scratched discs do not buy this set unless you can inspect the discs in person before leaving the store. Seriously, I thought I'd been sent a 2nd hand package... but the shippers are clearly not responsible - if they were the heavy pink box would have been damaged.",1311811200,3,1223,4.271551724137931
3558605,3,B001EZE5FG,"Just got in this box set today (well, just now picking it up at the Post Office). The set was packaged great; the outer box is probably the sturdiest cardboard box I've ever seen. So the set arrived in great shape. However, upon opening the set I found that one of the DVDs was missing; the slot for the movie ""Shot in the Dark"" was empty. And from the looks of it, it appears that the DVD was never inserted into it. That's why I'm only giving this set three stars - I would have given it five otherwise. I know some people will probably comment that I should just contact Amazon and send this set back for a replacement. I've decided not to do that though. I got this set as a Gold Box deal so it really didn't cost all that much, and I already have a copy of that particular movie that I picked up a few years ago. So I can just put that disc in the slot. It's just not worth it to box this heavy set back up and lug it the 30 miles back to the post office and then have to wait for the replacement to get here.",1311379200,,1014,3.9271844660194173
3558606,5,B001EZE5FG,"I just got this yesterday from the Gold Box Deal. It's a HUGE pink velvet book-style case (Compare the size of the DVD's to the book-style case in the picture). When you open the cover, it looks like it has two books inside. One is a huge Pink Panther hard cover coffee table book, the other book is a case that holds all of the DVD's. I bought this for thirty-five as the Gold Box deal of the day, and at the same time, ordered a ""Very Good"" used copy of Return of the Pink Panther for about 5 bucks, which I'll slip into this set.

Realize that most all of the 1-star reviews here are because ""Return"" didn't come in this set (How can it, if the studio doesn't own it?), or because of shipping issues, which are vendor/shipper related, and not product related.",1311292800,6,762,4.255172413793104
3558607,4,B001EZE5FG,"This review is about the packaging for the ""Ultimate Collection,"" rather than the Peter Seller movies which we all know are wonderfully great already.

This attractive box-set comes shrink-wrapped and then placed in its own cardboard box with stickers reminding the seller not to remove the boxset from the box because it is an 'Ultimate Collection.'  Next this box is place in a shipping box - so it's double-boxed to insure coming to you in excellent shape.  Its shipping weight is over 10 pounds and it feels like it.  The outer cover of the boxset itself, feels like a soft veleour-like material.  To me, it feels like micro-fiber - like the covering of my down blanket.  The case of the boxset is built very sturdy and makes a good coffee table book.

My problem is the cardboard slots which is where the DVD's rest.  I'm not a fan of cardboard slots for DVDs or BluRay Disc and this set proves it.  Approximately half of the discs had become dislodged from their slots during shipping.  Consequently there were quite a few scratches on the Discs.  One Disc was lodged in its slot so tight that it somehow made contact with the glue used to cement the cardboard together.  There was actually glue on the Disc which I had to remove with alcohol.  But the Discs were all playable so I decided to rip all the Discs to a backup harddrive anyways which I usually do with sets like this.  So I'm not sending it back to Amazon for a replacement.  Anyways I bought the set mostly for the cartoon collection and the included encyclopedic-like book as I already have the movies in my home collection.  The book, by the way, covers the forty year period of the movie productions.

One thing to remember about this set or any other Pink Panther Collection is that it does not include ""Return of the Pink Panther,""  arguably one of the best if not thee best of the series.  Something about Copyright issues or a different company made the movie or something like that.  But you can buy it reasonably cheap.  The only reason I bring this up is because, if and when you do buy the 'Return of ......' make sure you get the Universal edition and not the Artisan edition.  I have both of them and the Artisan edition is awful bad.  It looks like a burned copy of a bad VHS copy to DVD.  The Universal edition is an excellent transfer.  It's beautiful, actually, especially when compared to the Artisan edition.

Anyways, enjoy the set if you get it but I wouldn't buy it unless or until it is sold again as a ""Gold Box deal,"" which it probably will be someday.",1311206400,7,2547,4.482608695652174
3558608,1,B001EZE5FG,"The Ultimate Pink Panther Collection (original price $199), on sale for 34.99...too good to be true right.  Exactly.  Comes in a ginormous, velvety pink...I'm assuming ""collectible"" box.  Unfortunately mine came with an ugly dent in the cover (underneath the title sleeve which suspicioulsy showed absolutely no signgs of damage).  Also there were a few black smudges on the front of the case, almost like pencil lead.  You know how that is being removed from velvet textured covers...the smudge gets larger and more rubbed in, making it appear darker.  There were a few distinct hashmarks made from a pencil and a couple more small dents like someone was using the case as a writing surface to measure and make notes of something.  I commend Amazon on the job of sealing and boxing this item...it was double boxed and there were no signs of any damage to the cardboard from shipping or anything, but the item obviously sat opened somewhere, smashed in by an elbow or something and used as a sketchboard before being sold to me as a ""new"" item.  This was not a marketplace order, but came directly from Amazon as a ""Gold Box Deal"".  Being such a large and attention grabbing item...all smudged and smashed, makes it look like a big piece of trash on the shelf.  Very disappointed with the service from Amazon on this one.  The product itself...well the discs are shoved into glossy paperboard slots, some not even the right fit...I was willing to accept this, but they will eventually get badly scratched.  The separte sets of ""Classic Cartoons"" and Peter Sellers films, in soft bubble casing, were not only more compact but had much better packaging.  Stick to these and supplement with the missing films and cartoons...Although the Inspector vol 2 and Ratfink are not currently available.  Beware!",1311120000,5,1799,4.894389438943894
3558609,5,B001EZE5FG,"I ordered this during Sundays Gold Deal and received it the following day! Way to go Amazon!!! When I picked up the shipping box I was surprised at how heavy it was. When I opened it I found a beautiful and well constructed collection case with everything inside as promised. Some folks on here have a problem with the definition of the word Ultimate. This means it is the best available...which this is. It is one of the finest sets I have ever purchased. Just having the complete cartoon set is worth the $34. I paid for the set. I went to sleep happily last night watching PP cartoons =). I also purchased 'The Return of the Pink Panther' for an extra $11 which will almost complete my set (that leaves Steve Martin in PPII... no rush there).

The case is well constructed and the collectors book is high quality. The DVDs are all of solid construction. Everything is just right!

Again, this set is fabulous and I would recommend it at double the price I paid.",1311033600,6,964,4.440677966101695
3558610,1,B001EZE5FG,"Sorry.  Plain and simple. I don't care who owns what rights.  I am a huge Pink Panther Fan and for one studio to somehow not work this out with another studio on one of the best of the PINK PANTHER MOVIES is blasphemous and makes the word ""ultimate"" seem ridiculous in that it truly is not the ULTIMATE collection, especially as the RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER was the first true sequel to A SHOT IN THE DARK 11 years later!  RETURN OF THE PINK PANTHER was the best of the new breed of PANTHER movies and back in 1975, when RETURN was released, it was an event movie, PETER SELLERS is BACK!  So, please, this collection is EXTREMELY incomplete without RETURN and I can see why AMAZON has desperately lowered the price to $35...because, simply, this is NOT the ULTIMATE PINK PANTHER collection.  So MGM, stop pretending you put together the ULTIMATE set.",1310860800,13,852,4.5064935064935066
3558611,5,B001EZE5FG,"I love this cartoon. My mom loves this cartoon . She is almost 80. I take to her house so she can see the cartoon also. It is very entertaining and funny.

It's only [...] here on Amazon and it is, by far, the best in the series.

These Pink Panther films (except the first one, which was intended as a vehicle for David Niven until the producers realized that it was much more entertaining to watch Sellers) are OK, and funny simply because of Sellers.  But it's not worth this kind of price when you can get his best Clouseau in The Return of the Pink Panther/",1280102400,4,542,4.39

3558617,5,B001EZE5FG,"Hello. This is my first review on Amazon, so I hope to refine future reviews. I will base my review on three things: Packaging (How it all looks, size, & etc.), Performance (In this case, how the discs look with menus & ect.), & Content (What is being watched or the main reason you might buy this product).

Packaging (4 1/2 Stars):

The fuzzy pink cover with the Pink Panther on the front looks & feels nice. It is oversized to fit the book, most likely. The book is coffee table style. It is included with the packaging & very nice. The disc booklet is the problem however. It fits all of the 18 discs you will get, but in order to fit with the coffee table book it is in a booklet type with sleeves to fit the discs. Sleeves make fingerprints & scratches far easier. I had spare d-skins which cover the discs to prevent disc damages, but not included with this packaging. The sleeve-style disc booklet is my only issue with this packaging. (Could be worse & be The Simpson's Season 11 box set.) It is a big package, so will need a special place to store it.

Performance (5 Stars):

If you happened to buy the other box set featuring Peter Sellers, these are the same. Actually all are the same as previous released discs, but ""The Pink Panther"" 1964 original. It has a pop-up trivia track, & a Blake Edwards commentary. Both are nice extras. All look good, but the sound quality lessens for the less known films. Discs 3, 7 & 8 are stereo, but not 5.1 surround like the other films. All of the cartoon discs are not 5.1 either. Bonus extras are almost nonexistant. Trailers are included & some trivia notes. This set basically includes what was released before in one package. Nothing much new, but for ""The Pink Panther"" 1964 original extras, Vol. 2 of ""The Inspector"" cartoons, & ""Roland & Rattfink"" cartoons. The Jerry Beck book was nice too.

Content (6 stars):

I am a very biased huge Pink Panther fan. All films with Peter Sellers are great to me. The cartoons are great too. I will admit that the non-Sellers' films are weak, but still watchable. No one is Peter Sellers, but Peter Sellers. Peter Sellers is Inspector Clouseau. The others do bravely try. I am a completist. I mostly bought this set for ""The Inspector"" Vol. 2 cartoons & ""Roland & Rattfink"" cartoons. Besides the fact that Amazon had a great price that day. The Jerry Beck book is nice to have too. ""The Pink Panther"" 1964 (Disc 1) is a classic, ""A Shot In The Dark"" (Disc 2) might be the best film in the set, ""Inspector Clouseau"" (Disc 3) has Alan Arkin trying to be Peter Sellers & isn't too bad, ((Missing is ""The Return Of The Pink Panther"", but can be bought separately for not too much)) ""The Pink Panther Strikes Again"" (Disc 4) is more Sellers' goodness, ""Revenge Of The Pink Panther"" (Disc 5) is the last real full film in the series as Peter Sellers pasted away after it's making, ""Trail Of The Pink Panther"" (Disc 6) is mainly a tribute to Peter Sellers, ""Curse Of The Pink Panther"" (Disc 7) has Ted Wass trying to be Peter Sellers, ""Son Of The Pink Panther"" (Disc 8) has Roberto Benigni trying to be Peter Sellers, and ""The Pink Panther"" 2006 (Disc 9) has Steve Martin trying to be Peter Sellers. I must mention that not as much trying to be Peter Sellers as all try to be Sellers as Clouseau. The Pink Panther Cartoons (Discs 10-14) are all good to me, but alot of cartoons shorts to choose from. Some are more favorites than others. ""The Ant & The Aardvark"" (Disc 15) are some good cartoon shorts. ""The Inspector"" (Discs 16 + 17) are very good. ""Roland & Rattfink"" (Disc 18) are good too.

In honesty if not for the great Amazon price at the time & ""The Inspector"" Vol. 2 not out separately, I most likely would not have bought this. It is great for Pink Panther fans, but I can understand how not for all. Besides now the films & the cartoons are out separately in box sets of their own. The old Peter Sellers' Pink Panther Collection might be better for most too. All in all this set reviewed is great, but watch removing your discs. Thank you for reading.",1242691200,57,4052,4.401869158878505
3558618,2,B001EZE5FG,"The original movies have all been available before. One of them is the rancid 1968 film without Peter Sellers. Two of them are poorly assembled clipfests from the other movies. Another is a rotten 1993 spinoff. Yet another is the atrocious Steve Martin remake.

And then the set is filled out with tons of cartoons. The original theatrical stuff has some flair, but the TV cartoons are big stink bombs.

And of course (while MGM couldn't help it because of rights issues) Return of the Pink Panther isn't here at all.

Feel like shelling out a bunch of money for this yet?

The only thing of interest at all in this set is the original movie with ""over 60 minutes of never-before-seen footage."" 60 minutes of Peter Sellers outtakes? That's worth lining up for! Hopefully it will be available on its own at some point.",1227052800,18,817,4.613793103448276

I don't get this ? MGM search for more money
The only interesting thing in this set is 60 minutes extra footage, of the pink panther? I guess now that Blake Edwards is dead. MGM can
dig up purposly lost footage and nobody can object.?

I will not buy this set, and have feeling alot people won't either.
MGM is double dipping theres nothing wrong with 2004 collection

8300016,5,B001EZE5FG,"What a great set! I'm sorry I didn't buy this when Amazon had it on sale for around $36.95. It is no longer available except through third party sellers. I bought mine here on Amazon's Marketplace. My set was lightly used and in excellent condition. The pink outer box was a bit smushed at the corners, but the inside was perfect. Included is a book that contains the DVDs. You get almost all of the Pink Panther movies, including Steve Martin's version. You also get the Pink Panther cartoons! Also included is a beautiful coffee table book that details the history behind the Pink Panther movies. If you love the Pink Panther movies, this is a dream set to own. I have a cousin who loves Pink Panther, so this will be a gift to her. I  also bought a second set for ourselves. If you can find this set new or used here on Amazon, you are in for a treat. Perhaps they might re-issue this collection in the future.",1433030400,,913,4.3391812865497075

The Return of the Pink Panther is not in the set as the rights are owned by Universal, who refused to lease it to MGM for the box set.
 The cartoons are nice although I could care less about those.
