8536364,3,B0095ZIHYM,"I am so appreciative that this important subject matter is addressed in this documentary. So I want to start by thanking folks who created it.

With that said, the film is just OK and in my opinion missed an opportunity to do so much more.

It's actually very difficult to watch because it cuts too quickly (make you feel dizzy) and shows strange filler images that are often not relevant. Beyond that, it does not go deep enough on the side of the evolutionary theists. What exactly do they believe about biblical ideas many of us have been taught since we were children?

In addition, by only addressing young earth creationists vs. evolutionary theists, it really missed the reality that most people are in the middle somewhere. By painting the picture so starkly, you lose your audience.

Now, it did occur to me that the point was not to go deep but just to raise the issue for further learning. That is what happened to me - I have subsequently read many of the recommended books on the BiosLogos website - thanks guys, they are awesome.  Even so, I feel the film should have gone deeper given your access to so many amazing critical thinkers and leaders in the church. I wish it had been more like a Frontline documentary.",1383955200,3,1229,4.568181818181818
8536365,5,B0095ZIHYM,"As with all DVDs and books I've purchased featuring N.T. Wright, this product has excellent content. Having moved from agnostic to careful believer, work such as this is both edifying and stimulating.",1372118400,3,200,5.28125
8536366,4,B0095ZIHYM,"Great film for discussing evolution and creation from a Christian perspective.  Mainly focuses on biblical genre and how to read scripture, as well touching on ostensible issues of reconciling evolution with scripture.  I still rate the film highly, but would highly recommend watching the bonus footage as the feature edit is way too convoluted with interviewees finishing each others' sentences with regularity.  Overall, I would say buy it, watch it, discuss it, but don't leave thinking that this film covers the topic comprehensively.",1354147200,7,539,5.469879518072289
