7997543,1,B0000AKY5A,There were only about 2 good movies in the bunch. The cover of the DVD case paints a more interesting picture than what you actually get in this set. I would pass if a had a second chance.,1282003200,,188,3.973684210526316
7997544,3,B0000AKY5A,"BRENTWOOD 10 Movie Packs offer a variety of cinematic genres at bargain prices. Video transfers of their ""B"" movies are pretty decent, as is sound. The manufacturer's hinged boxes house DVDs adequately, but be careful the hinged sections don't pull away from the main spine! They're not that easy to reassemble.

SYNOPSES for GALACTICA:

""Day of the Triffids"" - A shower of meteorites produces a glow that blinds anyone who looks at it.

""The Day Time Ended"" - A solar-powered house (how convenient) gets deposited into prehistoric times because of a time warp. Co-stars Robert Mitchum's son.

""Idaho Transfer"" - Peter Fonda directed this time travel story. A group of scientists discover that Earth's future is pretty bleak.

""In the Year 2889"" - Atomic war survivors are menaced by cannibalistic mutant zombies.

""Journey to the Center of Time"" - Zero-budget and amateurish special effects can't ruin what was a boring story to begin with. Time travellers boomerang between the distant future and the prehistoric past.

""Killers From Space"" - A scientist claims he was captured by aliens who plan to overrun Earth with giant critters and bugs.

""Little Shop of Horrors"" - This cult classic was filmed by Roger Corman in two days on a $15,000 budget. It's the story of a boy and his man-eating houseplant. Watch for Jack Nicholson in a most demented cameo appearance, as a masochistic dental patient.

""Neophytes and Neon Lights"" - Slow-moving Australian film about five out-of-work people trying to survive in Sydney's underground.

""Star Odyssey"" - Earth is attacked and conquered by an intergalactic villain and his army of robotic androids.

""Warriors of the Wasteland"" - Yet another post-apocalypse drama has two mercenaries fighting off white-clad bikers. This ain't Mad Max, fer sure!

7997545,3,B0000AKY5A,"This collection of films is not related in any way to the series Battlestar Galactica.  It has 10 old sci fi flicks.  They are: ""In the Year 2888,"" ""Journey to the Center of Time,"" ""Idaho Transfer,"" ""The Day Time Ended,"" ""Star Odyssey,"" ""Warriors of the Wasteland,"" ""Day of the Triffids,"" ""Killers From Space,"" ""Little Shop of Horrors,"" ""Neophites & Neon Lights.""  I'm a fan of BSG and was intrigued by the title.  It was obvious, when I picked it up, in the store, that it was not connected to my beloved show.  I bought it any way, though.  ""Day of the Triffids"" alone, made it worth the money.  I've yet to watch the other nine films, but I'm confident I'll enjoy at least a few.  In conclusion, buy this if you like old ""B"" sci fi films.  Don't buy it if your sole interest is Battlestar Galactica.",1109721600,33,802,4.401360544217687
