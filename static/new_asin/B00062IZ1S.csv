2163334,5,B00062IZ1S,"This movie is a wonderful, light-hearted look at Mary Kay vs. Beauty Control and the personality differences of their founders.  It's fun EVEN for MK and BC Beauty Consultants if they don't take themselves too seriously!

Definitely a FUN girlfriends movie!  However, keep in mind that neither Mary Kay nor Beauty Control had any input into the making of this movie.  Additionally, the film makers took about 35 years of activity and portrayed it as though it all happened in just a couple of years.  That's Hollywood!!

2163335,4,B00062IZ1S,"I really enjoyed this movie.  It is rather cheesy, but then so is Mary Kay, Inc.  As a former (and reformed) Mary Kay Independent Beauty Consultant, I was able to watch the Seminar scenes with blinders off.  What a lot of flash with no substance.  This movie nails the hype that drives the Mary Kay and Beauty Control ""independent"" sales force.  I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys seeing so-called professional women reverting to high school level shenanigans in pursuit of ""the dream"", complete with a 1960 dress code.",1168473600,6,529,4.833333333333333
2163336,4,B00062IZ1S,"The most impressive thing about this film is how well the various roles were cast. Shirley MacLaine has never been one of my favorite actresses, but in this film she really IS Mary Kay, one of the more complex personalities on the American business scene. The film does a good job of presenting those, often competing, complexities while at the same time remaining funny.

The staging is also impressive. The story takes place in Dallas, and all of the interiors look like they came directly from the Horchow catalogue -- Where Too Much Is Not Enough.

The actors and actresses do a superb job of affecting the Dallas accent, a wonderful combination of ""Upstairs, Downstairs"" (mostly Downstairs) and ""Hee Haw.""

All in all, this film is a hoot, especially for anyone familiar with Dallas.

2163337,5,B00062IZ1S,"Shirley Maclaine earned every gold inch of her Emmy nomination for playing Mary Kay, the American Makeup Queen!  Having been born & raised in a rural Southern mountain community, I knew my fair share of Mary Kay reps & this movie completely captured the madness that surrounds the Mary Kay Clans.  The movie is a fabulous mix of camp & autobiography.  Shirley does a fantastic job at letting us get a real glimpse of the Mary Kay behind the makeup & wigs.  Parker Posey triumphs as the ""cheerleading,"" rival.  And I have never been a Shannon Doherty fan so I was completely impressed with how I was able to forget the ""90210 Brenda,"" & the Shannon that's in the tabloids and totally buy Shannon as the desperate housewife that wants to be Makeup Queen!  For some good ole fashion camp & some great acting pick up a copy of The Battle of Mary Kay!",1122508800,18,846,4.461038961038961

2163346,1,B00062IZ1S,"While Shirley MacLaine does a fantastic job of playing Mary Kay Ash, the rest of the actors in this movie are horrible. It was clearly a low-budget movie; the editing is bad with all it's splicing and switching back and forth. The script was poor, and the actors were some of the worst I have ever seen in my life.  No joke. I was actually embarrassed for them.  I don't how the producers were lucky enough to get Shirley MacLaine but the Casting Director did a terrible job choosing the others. Thumbs down.",1421280000,,508,4.451612903225806

2163352,3,B00062IZ1S,"This falls into the ""so bad it's good"" category. However, being a true southerner, fake southern accents done poorly can drive me nuts, and there were a lot of awful fake accents in this.",1370995200,2,187,4.529411764705882

The movie is pretty poorly written, but the acting is fairly close to the actual representation of the real-life MK people, from my limited experience.",1362787200,,299,4.555555555555555
2163367,5,B00062IZ1S,I love this movie! Its hilariously dramatic! It makes me happy to be a girl! Shannon D. is fantastic in her role as a over excited Mary Kay consultant. The grocery store scene is one of the best in the movie.,1359417600,,208,4.097560975609756
2163368,4,B00062IZ1S,"Shirley Maclaine gives a stella performance in her portrayal of Mary Kay.

2163371,5,B00062IZ1S,This video was funny and serious at the same time.  It is about the battle of Mary Kay and the founders of BeautiControl.

2163373,5,B00062IZ1S,"I saw this movie when it originally aired on television as ""Hell on Heels: the Battle for Mary Kay.""  I loved it!  Shirley MacLaine (probably more atractive than Mary Kay) is wonderful in this film.  Her little words of wisdom directly to the audience are great!

The movie centers on the battle between Mary Kay and BeutiControl.  Parker Posey and Shannen Doherty also give great performances.

If you're looking for high drama, this movie probably isn't it.  But it is a lot of fun!  I love watching it.  And it's very affordable.  I felt that the picture and sound quality were excellent.  There are no bonus features.

This is a must for fans of the great Shirley MacLaine.",1252713600,16,677,4.6440677966101696

8037683,4,B00062IZ1S,"I wasn't ever interested in Mary Kay cosmetics, though I had lots of friends try to market the stuff with not a whole lot of success. I did admire that she tried to create a company where women got the recognition and the compensation for their efforts. Most jobs STILL pay women less than their male counterparts. I have always liked Shirley Maclaine as an actress and I thought her depiction was very well done. She wanted women to put their best out into the world-can't argue with that philosophy.",1431561600,,501,4.5777777777777775
