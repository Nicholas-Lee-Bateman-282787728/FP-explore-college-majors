8671229,5,B00MAS05KK,"From the box...

""...the first film ever made inside an Amish community, with the cooperation of the Amish.""

""Filming was spread out over the four seasons, allowing us to see the cyclical nature of their lives: a father and his sons husking corn, an older woman making quilts in the winter, school-children playing softball, a congregation gathering for Sunday worship.""

""...a beautiful, captivating hour, but more importantly, encourages viewers to evaluate their own lifestyles and values, to consider what really determines progress.""

""Beautifully filmed and sensitive...and extraordinary achievement."" The Chicago Tribune.

""Thoughtful, imaginatively photographed...this documentary delivers."" The Cleveland Plain Dealer.",1213228800,,728,6.24
