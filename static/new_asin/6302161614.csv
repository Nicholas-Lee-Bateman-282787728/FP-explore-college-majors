7822059,4,6302161614,"While many people are aware of the web-slinging Marvel Comics super hero Spider-Man, his reclusive female counter-part is often over looked. Like the previously mentioned hero, Spider-Woman was a super hero who could not only cling to walls, have super strength, make spider webbing and had a 'spider sense'; but she could also glide along on air currents and change into her costume at will. Originally airing in 1979, Marvel Comics cast Knotts Landing favorite Joan Van Ark to voice the sleak heroine who secretly poses as Jessica Drew, mild-mannered reporter. The series started near the skirt-tail end of the then popular Wonder Woman television series and cashed in on some of that show's trademarks heirs. Most notably the famous Wonder Woman 'spin' in which transforms Plain-Jane Jessica Drew into the regal Spider-Woman. But unlike the Wonder Woman show, Jessica Drew could still use her powers while not in costume. In this episode ""Spider-Woman and the Fly"" we get to see the secret origin of the red and gold costumed heroine as a sinister mad scientist (isn't that always the case) tries to find the secret of sucessful animal splicing. It is with this knowledge that he becomes the fiendish 'Fly'! And as if that isn't enough, Spider-Woman must also contend with his sneaky assistant: a bionic midget! As you can tell, there's not alot of substance to the cartoon in comparison to some of today's plot basis but you have to keep in mind that in the late 70s the mind-set of the general public in regards to super horoes pretty much fell into that of 'camp'. Which isn't really bad at all. Considering how morbid some cartoon storylines can become as of late, it's kind of nice to be able to see a 'fun' cartoon every once in a while. And Spider-Woman happily fills that much needed void in spades.",1017360000,4,1810,4.80448717948718
