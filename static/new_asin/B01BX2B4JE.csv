I like that each murder takes about 4 episodes to solve so you really get fully developed relationships and story lines.",1483401600,,295,4.634615384615385

7669772,5,B01BX2B4JE,"I'd give this more than 5 stars if I could!

The Northlink ferry from Aberdeen, Scotland, to Lerwick, Shetland, is a 12-hour overnight journey. It's Leanne's first journey to Shetland, and it goes a little faster because she meets young Robbie on the ferry after his scuffle with a tall bearded man. A little smooching, a lot of talking, and he promises to show her around Shetland when they get there. If she notices that he's always looking over his shoulder, she doesn't mention it. Leanne eventually falls asleep in their booth and when she wakes, Robbie is gone.

The next morning, she's at the Lerwick police station insisting that Robbie never got off the ferry. There's not much they can do, since she doesn't know Robbie's last name or where he lived or where he worked. It sounds like a case of He's Just Not Into You. And she admits to D.I. Perez that Robbie hasn't called her.

That's because there's no cell reception in a dumpster.

And that is just the beginning Season 3's plot. By the end of episode 2 the story has morphed into something much larger, much more dangerous. The six episodes cover one big mystery, but there's branching stories and some twists and turns. Perez is still backed by DC Sandy Wilson and DS Allison ""Tosh"" McIntosh. Tosh is more confident than before. It's going to be a very tough case for her, so she'll need all the fortitude she can muster. DI Perez is usually poker-faced, but his equilibrium will be tested. Not the least because his step-daughter, Cassie, has grown up, and that can be tough on a Dad.

""Shetland Season 3"" first aired January-March 2016. Its six episodes total 342 minutes without commercials. The show is presented in 16:9 anamorphic with Dolby Digital 5.1. English SDH subtitles are available. There are no bonus extras on the disc sets.

I thought this was first-rate story-telling and I thoroughly enjoyed Season 3. I also recommend the Season 1 & 2 combo, which are in a  one-mystery per double-episode format.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shetland-Season-1-and-Two/dp/B00UA00EPQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shetland: Season 1 and Two</a>.

7669773,5,B01BX2B4JE,An amazing show. One of the very best on television. Every element of the show is top notch.,1471478400,3,92,4.166666666666667
7669774,1,B01BX2B4JE,"I loved this show.  Why do all good shows have to insert interracial relationships?  The last 2 or 3 years, every show injects this into their filming and it is their last season; they fail to get viewers and failing as a result.  Even Amazon uses an interracial couple in their Amazon Video banner.  I find all it to be disgusting.  Why is media so intent upon making it an ""in your face"" issue?  It is abhorent.  I do not argue the issue anymoreif you do not understand this issue, then you are in denial.  It has nothing to do with racism.",1470441600,10,542,4.245098039215686
7669775,4,B01BX2B4JE,"The third series of Shetland is a mini-series rather than a collection of discrete episodes. One storyline is stretched over six one-hour segments. It is not based on a book by Ann Cleeves but was written by Gaby Chiappe. Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez (Douglas Henshall) is still accompanied by junior partner DS Alison Tosh MacIntosh (Alison ODonnell), who is still annoying, and assisted by DC Sandy Wilson (Steven Robertson), an unusually competent constable. They are joined this season by PF Rhona Kelly (Julie Graham), public prosecutor responsible for investigating suspicious deaths and handling complaints. Grahams charisma is a welcome addition to the cast. Perez daughter Cassie (Erin Armstrong) is away at university so is less of a distraction. Her biological father, Duncan Hunter (Mark Bonnar), still has no credible role, but weve gotten used to him.

A young woman (Sara Vikers) is frantic when she wakes to find that the man she met on the Lerwick Ferry the night before is gone in the morning. She reports the man missing to police, but they're inclined to think he just blew off a shipboard romance. That is until a child is poisoned by consuming some ecstasy pills he found on a beach. DI Perez investigates and finds a backpack full of MDMA that belonged to the missing man, identified as Robbie Morton (Andrew Rothney). Witnesses saw Robbie in an altercation with Michael Maguire (Ciaran Hinds), whom Perez traces through the distinctive rings made by his girlfriend Freya Galdie (Saskia Reeves). When Maguire makes a false complaint against Perez to tie his hands, Perez suspicion grows. But there is much that his superiors in Glasgow don't want the local police to know, and the case takes a surprising turn.

DI Perez does a lot of flying back and forth between Shetland and Glasgow, as the key to two deaths seems to lie in that city. As a result, this third series does not rely so much on the atmosphere in Shetland as it does on intricate plotting. The plot is interesting; there are enough twists, turns, and false starts to fill six one-hour episodes, though toward the end, I was getting anxious for the writers to wrap it up. Ciarin Hinds is a strong presence, even though we don't get to know his character. That was smart casting, as Michael Maguire needs to be capable of driving the plot, even when hes not present. Generally, I think the plotting is impressive for a mystery mini-series, but the writers succumb to the bizarre British fashion and include two sex crimes in the mix, one of which is implausible. Theyre obsessed, and it does nothing for the plot or the characters.",1465084800,22,2621,4.861297539149888
7669776,5,B01BX2B4JE,"Shetland is one of those new television shows that seems to catch you unaware. I am a person who loves BBC Detective Series, and have since moved on to the Norwegian and Danish mystery series. This series takes place in Shetland, an artic archipelago off the Scotland coast. I am very good with accents, but the heavy accents in this series had me using the subtitle category.

We meet Detective Inspector Jimmy Perez, played by Douglas Henshall, a man who has recently lost his wife to cancer. He is bringing up their teenage daughter, and at the same time trying to solve all the crimes inherent in a community. And, this community has murder on its mind in this series. This series is from the books written by Ann Cleves, the same author of the 'Vera' books and series.

The Shetland Iseles are isolating, windy, all face the ocean. The inhabitants all work very hard, many are farmers, or work in the small towns of the isles. Religion seems to be a big part of their lives, marriage, birth and death. Whenever, DI Perez needs a pathologist he needs to call someone from one of the cities closest to the Isles. He pretty much has to solve all of the cases on his own with the assistance of two well informed and competent assistants. He counts on the townspeople to assist his investigations, and since he is fairly well known and liked, he can count on someone coming forward. DI Perez solves his cases in the usual hour or it often becomes a two parter episode. This is a well written and acted series.

In Series 3, DI Perez and his team are faced with several murders that are related. He and his Detective Alison Tosh go to Glasgow to meet with parallel detectives who are working on similar cases. It is here we meet, Asha, a specialist in relocating victims who testify against the mob. She is played by Archie Panjabi, late of 'The Good Wife, and she becomes a love interest. Series 3 is the best of The Shetland series. There are 6 episodes in this series, and they all lead up to an explosive ending. I look forward to Series 4.

7669777,5,B01BX2B4JE,A great detective series that not only delivers clever mysteries but a complex and endearing development of characters.  Kudos to all involved in its production.,1528502400,,161,5.44
7669778,5,B01BX2B4JE,"I watched the first season of Shetland and got hooked on these mysteries.  I then ordered season 2 and 3.  I told myself I would only watch one episode per night but in some cases watch the whole season in a couple of nights.  It is a great series if you like mysteries.  In addition, the scenery is beautiful as Shetland is an island in Scotland.  I hope there will be another season!!",1527638400,,386,4.232876712328767

7669781,5,B01BX2B4JE,"Recommend using close captions as accents and sometimes background noise can obscure the dialog.  Plots are complex and character portrayal is superb.  This is the only show my husband and I have ever binge watched, but we had to see how it turned out.  I literally do not know how you could stand to have to wait a week to see the next show!
Highest recommendations!!!  Every lead followed upon is reasonable.  Every character portrayal is believable.  You are drawn along as the struggle to solve a gruesome murder seems to point a direction then dead ends leaving frustration and an increasing desperation.
So much better than a 45 minute solution with a pretty bow!

7669817,5,B01BX2B4JE,"This is one of the best series I have seen in a long while.  The scenery and photography, the writing, the acting--all are superlative.

The scenery speaks for itself of course.  The photography, however, captures the cool bleakness so well I can almost feel it.  It manages to put me into the setting, which goes a great deal toward drawing me into the feeling of the whole production.

The writing is nothing short of amazing, especially the dialog.  It portrays ""normal"" people as they would react in any particular situation.  For example: the police ask a hostile witness a question; he replies with some clever, smart-ass retort.  Instead of ending with a glaring match between the two, full of promise of further battle, the policeman merely replies to the answer in a normal, politic manner, then reiterates and presses for an answer to the initial question.  So real! so refreshing!  There are numerous examples of this, and it has made me aware of how much I appreciate real human reaction to cinematic bombast.

The acting.  Douglas Henshall.  I was only vaguely aware of this actor before this series,, but he is now firmly on my map, in red letters!  In fact, all of the principals are outstanding, adept at the school of what I call ""detail"" acting.  Just a movement of the brow, a twitch of the lips, a distant look in the eyes--enough to convey a depth-load of thought and emotion while virtually motionless.  Reactions to questions are real; responses to situations are real; nothing overdone but portrayed so real that you cannot but  apprehend the feelings and feel them yourself.

Series One caught me.  Series Two almost lost me with its gangland drugs and crime kingpin angle (just  personal taste which finds organized crime/drugs tales boring), but Season Three brought me back again.  It managed to bring it back to a personal level, to a caring about individual persons.  And that is the thing that puts this series at the forefront: its ability to pull you into caring about the characters.

I would love to see this series continue forever.  I would watch every episode if it continued in its present mode.  Just excellent writing, excellent acting, excellent photography and excellent everything else that contributes to making this series what it is thus far.",1505347200,7,2289,4.867875647668394

Series 3 follows one case set off by one person--and some of this story, I just did not see coming. It is complicated and I am betting there are several characters from series 3 will some how show up again. The scenery of the Shetland Islands is a story all to itself. Beautiful, distant, amazing. There is a bit of comedy--just enough- between ""the Father and the Dad"" (watch the series to understand that reference). I purchased all of the series and I have re-watched series 1 and 2 again.

Douglas Henshall, as Jimmy Perez, captures the deep, kindly, intelligent detective in character if not in appearance. In the mystery novel series, Perez has Spanish blood and coloring: dark brown hair and eyes.

But the film series location is how the Shetland Islands are portrayed. And the setting and sense of place is palpable in the books and a huge attraction in the series. This film series is quality, and equals the fine caliber of the books. You do have to train your ears to understand the accents. If you like British mysteries, think you will enjoy this series in book and film.",1487376000,11,678,4.603305785123967

Each of these episodes has many, many scenes some only a few seconds but all play its own part in the storytelling.  It's marvelous how they pull it all together!

7669915,5,B01BX2B4JE,I luv BBC English crime. It is so different from the USA crime shows. You have to think more with the British shows. And you have to listen more because the accents sometimes get thick but that is another reason I like the shows. This series takes place in Scotland. The scenery is so interesting that I want to go visit. Not to many series make me want to go to area it is made in. Good Job Shetland.,1486598400,2,401,4.0886075949367084

7669924,5,B01BX2B4JE,"I enjoyed season 3, but I liked season 1 and 2 better because each crime was  solved in one or 2 episodes.  It's actually  the character development that is the most interesting aspect  of the show  to me, so I'm not so interested in one long story ( Season 3)  that encompasses the whole season.  Also, high level conspiracies  are so overused as a plot line these days.  Season 3 was definitely  ""darker"" as well.  But overall, season 3 was still good.  I enjoy Shetland because basically  the main characters are decent people unlike so many other detective or crime show ""heroes."" They are NOT mentally ill, socially awkward, secretly addicted, or have some serious character flaw.  They are decent people that you  can respect.",1486166400,7,732,4.744

7669949,3,B01BX2B4JE,"Somehow I expected more as I've read some of the books, but I find the Chief Inspector a little too down key for my tastes.  He frets too much about being politically correct, rather than just plunging in and getting on with the story.  I also had problems with his assistant who seems too rigid.  I don't think someone like her should work in law enforcement as she is humorless and does not seem to have much sympathy for dealing with people. This had a lot of potential but it just waddles along and occasionally becomes downright boring. Things that could have improved it were the relationship between the woman who ran the Witness Protection program and the chief Inspector, but he just let it fall flat.  What was he thinking?She was much more interesting as a character than the other two.  She also has some depth. The plot is stretched to the limit, and makes me think I really do not like these long series dedicated to one single story. Surely there is much more going on in the Shetland Islands that would be of interest. The photography is outstanding, but that about it.",1485648000,,1085,4.543589743589743
7669950,5,B01BX2B4JE,"The scenic islands of Shetland are to die for, such beauty to behold. The accents will make you fall in love with these Scots from the opening scenes. The music is enchanting, a sojourn all by itself. It is a poetic enticing series and thena body is found. A man trapped alive inside a semi loaded with scrap clothing headed overnight on a boat-ferry for recycling on the mainland. Glasgow becomes a second location for this two sides of the waters murder mystery that becomes so much more. DI Perez (Douglas Henshall) is back with his assistance coming from Wilson (Steven Robertson), and daughter/cop Alison (Alison ODonnell- yes, she plays a role with her real given name) who also gets caught up in terrible circumstances which becomes yet another mystery plot.
Best TV Drama of Scotland in 2016. Henshaw won Best TV Actor too.

Created from Ann Cleeves crime novels. It is a captivating nearly 6 hours of crime mystery viewing. Youll be glad you own the DVD even with no bonus material.
SDH SUBTITLES in English for those needing them for hearing loss and the delightful but hearty accents.
Perez even gets a bit of romance, although yet struggling with his past loss, with cop Asha (Archie Panjabi The Good Wife). Julie Graham (Bletchley Circle) returns to this series with the role of Rhona Kelly; I love her performance.",1485648000,9,1328,4.773913043478261

7669956,5,B01BX2B4JE,"So happy I found this show!  I adore the detective show Vera and when I spied that Anne Cleeves is the same writer for Shetland and Vera I knew I'd probably dig it.  Understatement. Shetland is an amazing atmospheric, superbly written mystery that is a joy to watch and tough to figure out. It reminds me of Hinterland a wee bit, but I like the actors and guest stars much more than Hinterland. But it is the writers and their ability to keep it twisty without making the show unbelievable that I feel compelled to write about. The scenery of Shetland doesn't hurt either.  I am so hoping for more seasons. All three that I've viewed so far I give 5 stars..  well done.",1485388800,2,669,4.370967741935484

The team we came to love in the first two seasons is back for this third season-- the enigmatic and brilliant DCI Jimmy Perez, played by the captivating Douglas Henshall, along with Detective Sergeants MacIntosh and Wilson come together a few years after the previous seasons to solve the case of a young man who died on the overnight ferry. Fine supporting work by Ciaran Hinds, James Cosmo, Archie Panjabi, and others round out the cast. Can't wait for a new season!",1485388800,2,680,4.581967213114754

Season 2 on Netflix was the 3rd series of Shetland on BBC and what is on the 'Season 3' DVD for sale on Amazon.

7669968,5,B01BX2B4JE,In the earlier series Inspector Perez was playing cat and mouse with a combination of nutty killers and/or greedy killers. He was definitely the cat then. In Season 3 he's up against all that plus a hard core criminal element and police corruption with Glasgow not Shetland as the source of this evil. Perez is on the edge of his capabilities and is no longer the cat but more of a mouse. This ups the dramatic tension exponentially. Subaltern Tosh goes right over the edge of her capabilities and winds up badly hurt. The power of this is amazing. It's a roller coaster where you never know which end of a role of the dice is coming up for good or evil.  Perez also is not Jessie Stone of Paradise New England. Stone was up against the same elements but always very capable of defending himself. Here Perez doesn't even carry a gun and always seems out of his league with this Glasgow mess.,1484956800,,891,4.432926829268292

7669983,5,B01BX2B4JE,"Season Three of ""Shetlands"" puts the very good first two seasons in the shade.  The six episodes of the third season follow a single mystery, a murder that seems to keep growing ever more complicated, despite the best efforts of DI Jimmy Perez and his crew.  The disappearance of a young man on the overnight ferry to Shetland quickly turns into a murder investigation, and attacks on a witness and a prime suspect suddenly carry the case into Glasgow's underworld.  DI Perez finds himself back on his old Glasgow beat, up against the odds and against some unexpected enemies who will stop at nothing to win, including hitting back at everyone Perez holds dear...

The cast of Season One and Two return, with Douglas Henshall as Jimmy Perez, Alison O'Donnell as DS ""Tosh"" McIntosh and Steven Robertson as DS Sandy Wilson.  The mystery is a real tangle that may keep even the sharp-eyed viewer guessing to the end.  The scenery in the Shetlands and elsewhere in Scotland is of course fantastic, and the urge to binge-watch may be irresistible.  Very highly recommended to fans of the series.",1484611200,30,1090,4.7967914438502675
