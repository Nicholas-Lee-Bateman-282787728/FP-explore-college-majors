8514821,4,B007CXQ7DM,So nice to have this movie on a well-mastered Blu-ray disc.  My only copy was an old BETA video tape which was okay qualitywise back then but wouldn't pass muster these days.  Very pleased and happy to add this to my collection.,1493596800,,228,4.404761904761905
8514822,5,B007CXQ7DM,"The only thing is the absence of French subtitles. I do speak French, but needed to understand 100% - that is why I had ordered the movie. I had to look for the subtitles file someplace else.",1491091200,,191,4.1891891891891895
8514823,5,B007CXQ7DM,"Outstanding funny movie.  However, you must know French (no subtitles).",1421452800,2,71,6.1
8514824,3,B007CXQ7DM,"It would have been nice to know that this edition has neither subtitles nor a dubbed soundtrack. If you aren't French speaking, do not buy this version.",1419033600,3,152,4.666666666666667
