The movie took me back to my teen years growing up in the Bronx and the attitudes that as teens we have to comply with our environment. But sometimes the memory of your first romance is inescapable. This movie although targeted a Middle America it brought fine memories of my first crush and everything I did to conquer my first love. Success in love can be achieved to awkwardness, a strong heart to put up with the embarrassments and most of all the will not to give in.  Good movie,let your mind relax and let it carry you through it and at the end you will have a satisfying smile.",1365638400,2,638,4.361344537815126
4250301,4,B0042FDCMC,"This was a fun, adult film, although about a bunch of high school kids who want to lose their virginity.  I guess Mr. Werkheiser wants to get out of the ""Ned's Declassified"" shell he has been trapped in -- as most kids want to grow up on screen.  Unfortunately, this film isn't really for adults, and its theme is not intended for children.  So who is the audience?  Probably why it went straight to video.  I'm an adult who is a child at heart, so I wanted to see Werkheiser ""grow up.""  That's who the film is for.  I enjoyed it, but it probably will have a small audience.",1363996800,8,574,4.2110091743119265
4250302,2,B0042FDCMC,"I was really disappointed with this movie. Besides the quality being poor so was the writing, plot, everything. Wish I hadn't paid for it.",1363564800,,138,4.791666666666667
4250303,5,B0042FDCMC,"I bought The First Time as a gift for my brother, it's a really cute movie and the price is crazy awesome. It arrived on time. I can't wait to give this to my brother on Christmas!",1355443200,,180,3.891891891891892
4250304,5,B0042FDCMC,I thought it had a good story.  I had fun watching it and I would recommend to friends and family.,1323388800,,98,3.9
4250305,5,B0042FDCMC,"When I first heard of this movie, I thought the concept/idea sounded a little strange. I decided to watch it and see what it was like, mostly because Devon Werkheiser is absolutely adorable and amazing. This movie was so cute and well put-together. At first it seems unrealistic that Anya and Victor would ever be together, but you just desperately want things to work out for Victor. He is adorable and tries so hard. He goes through lots of interesting obstacles and somehow finds his way out of them. You see their relationship develop and see how they oddly are perfect for each other. All around adorable movie, love it, definitely a must see!",1313366400,,648,4.692982456140351
4250306,5,B0042FDCMC,I remember watching Devon on Ned's Declassified this move was different from what I was use to seeing him in actually same goes for Scout since she was in recent new Halloween movies so it's opposite on both ends haha,1298160000,3,217,4.45
4250307,5,B0042FDCMC,"After finishing this movie, I was amazed. Scout Taylor-Compton has been doing a lot of really good movies like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Triple-Dog-Blu-ray/dp/B003TVTS7I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Triple Dog [Blu-ray</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Runaways/dp/B0034G4P6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Runaways</a>. I've been waiting to see The First Time (originally Love at First Hiccup) for a long time. I received an imported copy of the movie and finally got to watch it. After I finished it, I fell in love with it. It was absolutely amazing. There are a couples problems with the movie: 1. the length, it's just way too short, 2. Why don't you show the scene?, and 3. The quick ending. But the movie is really good, I'm just confused how this didn't make it to the cinemas, it's defiantly better than some of the movies that have been releasing in the cinemas lately (now on DVD), like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grown-Ups/dp/B002ZG97TW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grown Ups</a>. This movie is a must have!

The DVD has NO special features, subtitles, ect. It includes the movie only. I think the movie should be released on Blu-Ray, it'd look much nicer, the movie is some-what fuzzy, but it's because of the low-budget studio - look at the price of the DVD.",1289174400,6,1419,6.276923076923077
8413551,5,B0042FDCMC,There are two similar movies with this name.  Both are pretty good.  I really enjoyed this movie and decided to buy it after renting it.  Ok acting.  A good plot.  Good dialog. Pretty well done.,1434585600,,194,4.428571428571429
8413552,3,B0042FDCMC,"The First Time - is a typical high school movie. The kid no one really sees, has a crush on the most popular girl. What happens is all the awkward encounters until it happens - he gets the girl.",1433808000,,194,4.0
8413553,3,B0042FDCMC,"Better than I expected. One does not expect much from teen sex romp stories, but this one had some charm and some heart. Plus some funny characters and some classic scenes.

If you think you might enjoy a teen love story told with some wit and humor, then you will probably enjoy this.",1400284800,,285,4.377358490566038
8413554,5,B0042FDCMC,The movie is really good funny very good to watch the movie is real good I think people should watch and enjoy it,1396483200,,113,3.9565217391304346

8413556,5,B0042FDCMC,this movie is so cute! i had to get it. the main character was so funny and the way he would get hiccups whenever he saw the girl he loved was really cute.,1392681600,,155,3.727272727272727
8413557,5,B0042FDCMC,It's a really funny movie . Very different in its own way ! It is definitely worth buying . There are a lot of movies similar but this one has its own twist to it.,1373760000,,163,3.6857142857142855
8413558,4,B0042FDCMC,"The First Time almost disguises itself as a perfectly innocent comedy involving a high school freshman boy and a senior girl that fall in love, however occasionally the language intensifies rather inappropriately.  This usually only happens whenever the younger brother of the freshman appears on screen given how dirty his mouth is, and despite how disrespectful and overly confident he is, his appearance surely provides the funniest lines of the film in my opinion.

When a freshman (played by Devon Werkheiser) becomes interested in the senior (Scout Taylor-Compton) of course as a young man, he feels embarrassed and doesn't know how to approach the girl of his dreams without worrying he might say or do the wrong thing, and only end up humiliating himself.  However he's actually more courageous than most his age, so rather soon he's able to meet up with the girl at a party where it's realized by Scout Taylor that she has a younger boy who's interested in her.

Of course the film has the classic ""She already has a boyfriend and he's an arrogant jerk!"" type character.  And yeah, he pretty much disrespects Devon Werkheiser and underrates his ability to win over his girlfriend (as you can probably guess, Scout Taylor actually dates this lowlife for a short period before being swept off her feet by Devon).  This movie basically does nothing original in the teenage/romance department, but the storyline is innocent and honest enough that anyone going to high school right now would certainly be able to relate to it, and that's the age group the movie's intended for.  Other than the final 20 minutes being too drawn out, the movie doesn't really have any flaws.

The humor is definitely light which makes it more appropriate for a Disney film with the occasional awful language that I mention above.  The ""tarantula in a birthday present"" is easily the funniest moment of the entire movie.  It's hilarious that Devon's character is shy and quiet around girls, whereas his HILARIOUS younger brother is more destructive, open with sharing his honest feelings despite how rude they may be, and doesn't seem to care about hardly anything other than pulling pranks with his one friend and making others feels miserable.  Still, it's all in good-hearted fun since he comes across more like a pesky younger brother.

On a final note, occasionally I'd notice a facial similarity between Devon and Scout Taylor, which is beyond strange.  They could almost pass for brother and sister.",1370908800,,2490,4.971084337349398
8413559,5,B0042FDCMC,The movie was so sweet they were weirdly perfect for each other they are my want to be couple. An awesome Movie,1370736000,,111,4.090909090909091
8413560,2,B0042FDCMC,"This movie was called ""Love at First Hiccup"" when released in 2009. But I have seen it listed as being released in '09, '10, and '12 in different versions here on Amazon. IMDB says it was released in '09 as the ""Love at First Hiccup"". The DVD is $4.24 if you buy it, on Amazon Video it goes  for $14.99! A whopping $10.75 difference. Or rent it for $3.99. I hate when they try to repackage older DVD's because maybe the actors are more famous now and try to cash in.",1370217600,2,466,4.1208791208791204
