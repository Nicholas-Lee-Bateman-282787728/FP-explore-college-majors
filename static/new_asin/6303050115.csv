Yes, I am a diehard fan of Mario Lanza.  I admit it. This movie does not have the best plot, not the best acting but it does have Mario Lanza.  That is enough.  He does his best under difficult conditions and does so splendidly.  The setting, Rome in the 1950's, is beautiful.  The singing is glorious.  Even his imitations, which are somewhat funny, are skillful.  This is an enjoyable movie. All one needs is to focus on Mario Lanza.

He was the most versatile tenor who ever walked on a stage. He could sing opera like the greatest of them. He was a master at ""crossing over"" from lyric opera to popular singing. As a result, he was a top recording artist and concert performer. In the ""Great Caruso"" he also showed he could be a global movie sensation. The movie about the amazing Neapolitan tenor actually was about Mario Lanza. It turned the Great Caruso into the Great Lanza. He exhibited all of his splendid qualities.

His films and his voice inspired me to write my recent book about Mario Lanza: ""A Kid from Philadelphia, Mario Lanza, the Voice of the Poets."" It is not a biography. There have been several excellent ones about him. This is a book from a fan. It exhibits his qualities, talents, passion and love for his art. I wanted it to be a ""page turner"" that would be impossible to put down while listening to the magnificent voice of Mario Lanza.  listen to Mario sing as you read it.

Anyone who loves Lanza the movie star, the tenor, the popular singer and the human being, who did so much in such a short time, will love the ""Seven Hills of Rome.""",1381536000,2,1805,4.940397350993377
562620,4,6303050115,"This has wit and verve but the love story is less compelling. The singing shows Lanza as great in voice as ever and in his satire of the pop icons of America that he mimics, he shows a real talent for comedy. Worthwhile and at times deeply touching and should be seen if only to completely know the Lanza film oeuvre.",1379203200,,317,4.213114754098361
562621,5,6303050115,"As I have said before, Mario Lanza is a Beloved Tenor. I treasure all his movies and recorded music. Bravo!",1368921600,2,107,4.4
562622,3,6303050115,"I have watched this and the other Lanza films many times over the years. The question that keeps arising whenever I view ""Seven Hills of Rome"" is, why isn't it better? When it first came out, I was in 8th grade, and I remember a review in Highlight, a magazine for kids. The review was glowing, recommending it for all audiences as a family film with gorgeous footage of Rome and a wonderful story. Well, it is an absolute gem of a travelogue presenting (especially in its wide screen version) a panorama of all things Roman in 1958...from a helicopter.

I saw the film with my Dad in its first release in Philadelphia, Mario's home town, and the theater was packed. People responded favorably throughout the flick. The famed imitation sequence was especially appreciated with much laughter and applause. Mario has his vocal exercises interrupted by a bunch of (Italian) teens jitterbugging out on the patio. He steps onto his balcony to see what the din is all about. The kids ask, ""You digga dis rock n roll?"" He digs it ""the most."" ""Hey,"" calls another, ""Do you know Dino Martino?"" This begins small parade of Italian American pop singers, Dean, Frankie Laine, Perry Como, all of whom Lanza imitates vocally and even visually, and not badly. A final girl asks if Lanza knows Louis Armsrong. ""Good ol Satchmo, he's one of my favorites,"" avows Mario. ""But he's not Italiano,"" says the girl.

This line roused a raucous round of laughter from the theatergoers. The sudden incursion of an African American performer into a set piece devoted to Italian American singers startled and delighted my fellow viewers. And I'll always love Mr. Lanza for his generous and good-hearted reply: ""Honey, he doesn't have to be,"" issued in the immediately recognizable growl of good ol Satchmo himself.

So much for the good parts. Biographers of Mario Lanza claim that there was a much better script for this movie, but it was chopped, diced, minced, and blended in to the mediocrity we have today by the clammy hands of those involved with the movie who wanted it to be light, cheery, unoperatic, sweet, and basically bland. I think this is true. Lanza's previous film, Serenade, was none of those things. It was based on a grim and controversial James Cain (!) novel and featured a cast of uniformly homicidal misfits, and was chock full of opera and other Italian ditties. It did not fare all that well at the box office. ""Seven Hills"" would not suffer this fate. It featured only one aria, ""Questa o quella,"" which, for good measure, was sung about as badly as Lanza is able to sing an aria.

I detect the remnants of the ""good script"" here and there. Mario's cousin, played by the winning and funny Renato Rascel, has some caustic lines delivered at American tourists who claim to have only 10 minutes to see the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. That's interesting, says Rascel. ""It only took Michelangelo ten years to paint it."" The story may will have been a dramedy satirizing the shallowness of Americans of wealth and indolence set against the relative innocence and free-spiritedness of the impecunious Italians who populate the movie. I don't know and never will. ""Paris,"" says that erstwhile helicopter pilot, ""is the most beautiful city in the world...consciously; Rome is the most beautiful city...unconsciously.""

So we have a mish mash of a tale, a love story where absolutely no one gets kissed, a travelogue where no one's having a holiday, a musical with too much time between songs, and the greatest singer of his generation stuck inside it all. Mario, as always, gives it his best, has as much fun with it as he can, and, of course, laughs loudest when the joke is on him.

In one hilarious scene, he is applying for a job as a singer in a fairly good night club although in America he is a nationally renowned TV star. The proprietor dismisses him without an audition, claiming that Italy exports singer, it doesn't import them. As Lanza leaves the club, their star tenor begins rehearsing and is heard to sing, ""Be My Love..."" the song above all others identified with Mario Lanza. The singing is truly awful, and Mario winces just as we do, laughing all the way.

It was only years later I discovered that it was Lanza himself singing that hideous rendition. The man had his faults, but his was a soul full of great good humor and utterly lacking in meanness. We can be grateful he came our way.",1365379200,5,4403,4.71038961038961

562718,3,6303050115,"I saw this film for the first time when it was released in 1957 or 1958. If you compare this film to his first 3 (That Midnight Kiss, The Toast of New Orleans, and The Great Caruso), there is a definite decline in the overall quality of the performance. By comparison, his last film, For the First Time, I believe is superior to this one in all respects. I have all 8 of the films Lanza performed in including his 5th film, The Student Prince (1955), where only his singing voice was used. I believe he reached his peak in the quality of his singing voice at that point in his brief career. His health was declining in his last 3 films which led to his death in 1959.",1352419200,5,667,4.178294573643411

562722,4,6303050115,"It is only as an adult that I've come to appreciate the voice of Mario Lanza, the tenor heartthrob of 1950's America. Perhaps it happened as a result of my admiration of the recordings of Andrea Bocelli, the tenor heartthrob of 2010's America. Whatever the reason, I know now that Lanza was a great talent, and that fact is brought out in the movies that he made back in the day. By today's standards, those films are pretty hokey, but their exuberance is catchy. The Seven Hills of Rome has very little to do with the actual seven hills of Rome, but takes its title from one of the many numbers that Lanza sings during the course of the story. Basically, the plot has to do with the attempts of Mark Revere, a young American with a killer voice who tries to find his fiancee, who has flounced off to Italy.  While in pursuit of that goal, he breaks into song at every possible opportunity, on the streets, in the piazzas, and eventually, in a series of nightclubs and theaters. Naturally, everyone is bowled over, including a pair of young beauties who provide the love interest. As is typical of its era, Lanza's character is ever so friendly, thoughtful, and wholesome, and he did a good job in a role that required a lot of singing and only a little earnest acting.

The Seven Hills of Rome was filmed in the vibrant color we've come to expect from that time. The costumes are very costume-y, the scenes are full of Italian ""types"" (including some stereotypes), and overall, it's a light, fun romp full of beautiful  music,operatic and popular. This guy could sing!",1327968000,2,1569,4.556737588652482

562727,3,6303050115,"I'm probably being a little generous in giving this film three stars. After all, it's undoubtedly Mario Lanza's weakest movie effort. The fault isn't his, but rather the meandering script and lack-lustre direction. To make matters worse, there is very little in the way of substance for Lanza to sing. Still, there are a few compensations along the way...
Lanza's previous film, the much underrated Serenade, was a poor performer at the box office in 1956. Nervous producers decided that Lanza's next movie should shift the emphasis away from the drama and solid operatic selections to a much lighter presentation of the popular tenor. Unfortunately they went too far, reducing Lanza to just one aria (Questa O Quella from Rigoletto) and a fragment of another. Instead of his usual role as an opera singer, Lanza is merely a TV/nightclub performer this time, and his selections include the pretty Arrivederci, Roma and a handful of largely forgettable popular ballads. Ironically, the biggest vocal highlight of this movie is Lanza's imitations of OTHER singers. His impersonations of Perry Como, Frankie Laine, Dean Martin and - believe it or not - Louis Armstrong are hilarious, and amazing in their accuracy.
The original script was reportedly a good one, but the producers soon realised that it contained enough material for a five-hour movie. This resulted in drastic re-writes (even on the film set), and therein lies the problem. This is a movie without a solid story, and instead we are left with some enchanting shots of Rome, some sporadically good acting from Lanza, and two engaging co-stars in the Loren-lookalike Marissa Allassio and the popular comedian Renato Rascel.
This movie will probably not win Lanza any new admirers, but diehard fans will enjoy it. Happily, Lanza's next (and final) movie, For the First Time, was a considerable improvement, with enough opera AND popular ballads to satisfy every type of music lover.",1003190400,24,1941,5.126182965299685
