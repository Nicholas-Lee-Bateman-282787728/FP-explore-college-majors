3649964,3,B001IW9NLQ,"This is my first Tai Chi video so I have nothing to compare with. Overall, I liked the excercies and I liked how he broke every move into multiple segments to make sure the viewers get it. But his explaination of each move is not very clear and sometimes lacks details. For example, he should point out when a movement requires shifting weight or bending knees. These details are ommitted from time to time. He also needs to incorporate more breathing instructions into the movements. I was able to follow it, but my mom (whom I bought the DVD for) was confused by the instructions.",1030233600,40,582,4.552380952380952
3649965,5,B001IW9NLQ,A very good video with many illustrations.,1405555200,,42,5.142857142857143
3649966,4,B001IW9NLQ,"This DVD is easy to follow and helps you gain flexibility in body joints.
Dr. Paul Lam provides students to lead you through the movements as he explains then later demonstrates himself.
Very pleased with this product.",1393459200,,218,4.918918918918919
3649967,5,B001IW9NLQ,"As we age it is important to find ways to exercise and this is one that really helped me. I have continued to use this DVD on going. I recommend it to anyone. It help with concentration, balance and body movement.",1393286400,,213,4.219512195121951
3649968,3,B001IW9NLQ,"The DVD is badly arranged for regular practice.  The exercises are interrupted with constant reminders about when to consult your doctor, etc.  One is told to do the warm-up at the end, but it is not repeated, and involves several minutes of trawling back and forth to find it.  Each exercise comprises demo./practice/performance, the first two being shown face-to-face, so easier to do in mirror image but the last is following from behind.  The limb that gets most exercise is the right index finger on the forwar/back button.  I have a very old ""Geriatric  aerobics"" video which is much better, is a joy to do.  this one is a boring chore and I have to make myself do it, when I can summon up the will power",1392422400,,710,4.543307086614173
3649969,5,B001IW9NLQ,"I have been doing Tai Chi for a quarter of a century, but wanted to learn a new form. This version of the Sun Style form is a lovely form for those with joint issues, much softer than the Yang Style Short Form I have practised for most of my 'career'. The video is very easy to follow.",1388448000,2,285,3.9310344827586206
3649970,5,B001IW9NLQ,"This was a Christmas gift for a friend, we use this DVD at the senior center and my friend really wanted it for home. She was thrilled .",1388102400,,136,3.892857142857143
3649971,3,B001IW9NLQ,it was too hard to follow the instructions; the major flaw is the 15 minutes of advertising prior to the start of the program,1387670400,,125,4.25
3649972,4,B001IW9NLQ,This dvd is very good. It is very thorough in the instructions and tells you very clearly how to do tai chi,1386979200,,107,3.909090909090909
3649973,4,B001IW9NLQ,It is easy to follow the move.  Good for beginners.  The only thing that I was disappointed was the description of the website saying that it has language in Catonese but it fact it was Mandarine.,1384819200,,196,4.416666666666667
3649974,5,B001IW9NLQ,"Dr Lam gives a clear and concise lesson in Tai Chi for Arthritis. I am studying Tai Chi with Kathy Falzone in Sebastian, Florida. She follows his teaching method of learning progressions in movement of each of the various types of Tai Chi for your Health. It makes it so much easier to learn! I bought the tape because I wanted to be able to review what took me several months to learn, and it's almost like having him at home with me teaching me in a way I understand best. Definitely worth the investment.",1381363200,,507,4.347368421052631
3649975,5,B001IW9NLQ,My Tai Chi instructor recommended this DVD so I could continue learning the movements.  The gentle movements allow you to move at your own pace gaining strength and flexiblilty.,1369180800,,177,5.103448275862069
3649976,5,B001IW9NLQ,I got this for my mother.  She likes it since she can sit down and do some of the exercises when she is not feeling steady on her feet.  Good exercise for the elderly.,1368057600,,167,3.8823529411764706
3649977,4,B001IW9NLQ,hard to follow.  Book was received in good shape.  would not buy this one at all buy dvd 2 only,1352505600,,95,3.7
3649978,5,B001IW9NLQ,"Although I am currently in a Tai Chi class, this DVD explains the moves more thoroughly.  I love the background information given on Tai Chi history as well as very thoroughly explaining the Tai Chi moves.",1338163200,,205,4.694444444444445
3649979,4,B001IW9NLQ,"I had watced Dr. Lam on Youtube a few times to see if Tai Chi could help improve my flexibility and strength.  After a month of serious use I can safely say I feel better and have better flexibility in my ankles,knees,hips,back,elbows,and hands.  You must pace yourself using the movements.  Tai Chi is a gentle exercise and you may think it doesn't work but it does.  It took me 2 weeks to really start seeing improvement.  So pace yourself, LISTEN, to the instructions and start feeling better with NO drugs.  I plan to get TAI CHI for beginners after I am bored with this DVD.",1336262400,2,579,4.466666666666667
3649980,5,B001IW9NLQ,"I really enjoy doing these tai chi videos. It took me a while to get into the routine, but now I do them nearly daily and I really do feel relaxed and energized at the same time.  It is really worth doing!",1330732800,,205,3.880952380952381
3649981,4,B001IW9NLQ,Fabulous  Worth the money Use it to your advantage It will help to reinforce your learning experience and confidence in Tai Chi,1319155200,,127,4.7727272727272725
3649982,4,B001IW9NLQ,I am pleased with my video on Tai Chi for Arthritis I bought throught Amazon and how fast I got it to my house. It is well worth the money.,1314057600,,139,3.6666666666666665
3649983,3,B001IW9NLQ,"This product does not contain the most recent warmup movements that are approved by the Arthritis Foundation. It also does not contain the full scope of Tai Chi movements, left and right.",1308700800,2,187,4.875
3649984,5,B001IW9NLQ,"This DVD explains the benefits of ""Tai Chi for Arthritis"" and takes you through opening exercises and twelve movements, closing with exercises.  Everything is well explained and well shown in sequences.",1304294400,,202,5.516129032258065
3649985,2,B001IW9NLQ,"There is quite a bit of extraneous informational/promotional material at the start of the DVD. I was not interested in being told at length about the history and value of Tai Chi, I just wanted to learn how to do it.

I gave this two stars because the instructors broke a basic rule for teaching any kind of physical movement: they started their teaching of each position while facing the camera, thereby forcing the viewer to try to learn by mirror image. They did break the positions down into steps and slowed them down, but as someone new to Tai Chi I still found it nearly impossible to follow along with a mirror image. Eventually the teachers turned around, but at that point they demonstrated the move at regular speed, assuming you had already mastered it. Which I hadn't. Not an insurmountable problem for the basic positions, but when they moved on to the advanced ones I gave up. And I'm not new to learning steps or positions, having had 20-plus years of dance lessons.",1301529600,11,982,4.611428571428571
3649986,5,B001IW9NLQ,I wanted a video that would help me with mobility even though I have arthritis.  This video does that.,1299369600,,102,4.368421052631579
3649987,1,B001IW9NLQ,"While I am sure the instructions would be most helpful, the DVD is not good quality and skips. Unfortunately, I don't have the return bill.",1299283200,2,139,4.6
3649988,3,B001IW9NLQ,"Video quality could be a lot better. Would be nice if host spoke better english. Needs better reverse instruction. The on screen right is the viewers left, it gets confusing.",1297728000,,174,4.833333333333333
3649989,5,B001IW9NLQ,I have a number of Dr. Lam's books and DVD's and I would recommend this one for older adults. I was certified in 2010 to teach Tai Chi for Arthritis and enjoy helping people overcome their difficulties with arthritis. His booklet by the same name is worth the price to go along with the DVD. His book Teaching Tai Chi Effectively is great for anyone who teaches tai chi no mater what style it may be. His methods apply to them all.,1295827200,,431,4.2682926829268295
3649990,5,B001IW9NLQ,"Since arthritis hit me hard a year ago, I have been looking for ways to improve my health, I am hoping that Tai Chi will be the start of a better me.",1285372800,,149,3.6875
3649991,5,B001IW9NLQ,This dvd augments a four session class I attended at our local community college.  I liked the way it showed each movement in detail.  It was easy to start and stop and follow.  With only four hours of class instruction and practice it was difficult to remember all the fine points of the movements.  This dvd augmented my class beautifully.,1281484800,13,341,4.633333333333334
3649992,5,B001IW9NLQ,"Having just started the study of Tai Chi, learning the basic moves is very important. Dr. Lam is a wonderful teacher, and his directions are easy to follow. The sequence of the moves, or forms, is very well thought out, and he is specific about hands, feet, and breathing. Well worth the price, this DVD will bring you the peace of a mental and physical exercise that strengthens the body and spirit. Love this DVD!",1280534400,30,415,4.546666666666667
3649993,5,B001IW9NLQ,This video is very helpful to beginners in Tai Chi.  The repetition and  slow motion of his moves make it very easy to follow.  I found it very useful.  I would definitely recommend it to everyone whether you are a beginner or an old pro in need of a refresher course.,1272412800,17,268,4.196078431372549
3649994,4,B001IW9NLQ,"This product was sent promptly and received in good condition. The DVD is good in describing and showing the various exercises. I believe I will enjoy it for a long time. I hope.

3649995,5,B001IW9NLQ,Excellent product clear and easy this is the second time I have bought this. He is a great teacher and Teaches in the U.S. will be in Tacoma in June. Want to use this everyday. Thanks Amazon,1265587200,11,190,4.162162162162162
3649996,4,B001IW9NLQ,"Good video with clear instructions.  I had been trying to do this in a class, but it was hopeless and I kept getting lost (don't know my left from my right) but this is very clear, goes over every movement very slowly and clearly...I have just used the first 12 movements thus far and the warm up exercises...there is more to come and I look forward to continuing on with the ""breathing"" that will come next after I have perfected this beginning part.  A very useful video all told.",1262822400,62,482,4.404494382022472
3649997,5,B001IW9NLQ,This tape goes well with a Tai Chi course I am taking.  It's aimed at arthritis sufferers.  I don't have arthritis but I do have a disc problem in my back.  I use the tape to practice what I learn at the course.  I like the presentation.,1259020800,20,237,3.978723404255319
3649998,4,B001IW9NLQ,"He teaches step by step, from the front and from the back, and adds warm-up and qi gong exercises.  The video is well-conceived.
I find Dr. Lam's Chinese/Australian accented English a bit hard to follow, so I use the beautiful French track.",1253059200,,240,4.714285714285714
3649999,5,B001IW9NLQ,"I have rheumatoid arthritis affecting most of my joints and was looking for a set of very slow, gentle exercises.  This tape fits that bill quite well, I am able to get some benefit out of it on all but my worst days.  The flowing movements are very relaxing.  I like that they stress warming up and cooling down, not over-extending yourself, and modifying any movements that are difficult.  There are days that I cannot maintain the positions with my knees bent so I simply stand up.
The tape is very easy to follow and the movements are thoroughly demonstrated.  You can watch each movement described and repeated in detail, or once you are more familiar you can go through the first 6 or all 12 at once.
I also enjoy the Qigong exercises.  Stress tends to send me into a flare so practicing them should be beneficial.
Remember though that just because this tape was designed for arthritis sufferers doesn't mean you should be able to do it no matter how sick you are!  If you're having a bad flare or your arthritis is not under control and exercising makes you feel miserable just do your range of motion stretches every day and put your feet up until you feel better.",1214524800,,1172,4.5
3650000,5,B001IW9NLQ,I took a class in tai chi for arthritis and wanted to continue although it was not offered for another couple of months.  This DVD is very helpful in all the movements and Dr. Lam is very inspirational.,1168300800,,202,4.315789473684211
3650001,5,B001IW9NLQ,"This may be just what I need.  I have rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, so my exercises are limited.  This is relaxing and helpful.  I especially like that Dr. Lam has a student show the exercise from the back so I can follow it and not confuse my right from my left as I typically do with tapes.  I can't wait to get these steps mastered, so I can go to the next tape!!  This is very beneficial for someone who (at age 41) has little physical activiy.  I started this tape having an intense headache and body ache.  They were almost gone afterwards!

3650002,5,B001IW9NLQ,"I have this. I use this, I love this! Dr Paul Lam very clearly, and very slowly, guides you literally step by step through gentle rhythmic movements. His participants, just a tad older than I am,  demonstrate the movements from the back, in the same position that you are in when you watch the DVD.

I've never been able to follow an exercise programme from watching a video or disc before, but this one I watch and follow twice a week, all at my own speed. Fortunately, my arthritis is sporadic and more irritating than dehabilitating, but it's the regular exercise of tai chi and walking that keep it under control.

I have watched Dr Lam's tutorial so ofter that I think of him as an old friend. And, just like an old friend, he gives me good advice.",1131580800,50,753,4.402877697841727
3650003,5,B001IW9NLQ,"Learning from most tapes and DVDs is difficult at best but Dr Lam has great clarity, focus, different angles to view, and some repetition for learning from tape or DVD. He had Arthritis himself before becoming world class martial artist and has a special interest in the subject. He shows the form and explains; then he comments on a single student doing it; then a group of students do the form with a leader facing them so one can watch both from the front and behind. He also uses balck background for demonstration by instructor in white uniform.",1112227200,42,550,4.622448979591836
3650004,1,B001IW9NLQ,The introduction they could have done with out and Dr. Lam has people to help show the movements.  Way to much distraction when there are that many people in a video.  I didn't learn a thing from it.,1062633600,14,199,4.2105263157894735
