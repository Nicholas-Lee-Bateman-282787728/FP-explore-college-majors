1633524,5,B00005NGAJ,"I must disclose that I am a bit of an overeager fan of Irish Dancing at least in the form of Lord of the Dance, Feet of Flames, and Riverdance. I have seen all of the shows several times and had the fortune of going backstage after a Lord of the Dance performance to meet a few of the dancers (who were quite friendly and generous with their time).  And, I listen to the music as I work out.  I have all of the shows on DVD and video and to this day watch them almost daily.
 As such, I was very happy when I learned of this new DVD title, Gold. Michael Flatley cerainly is not shy and is known for his ""confidence,"" but this new DVD is extremely entertaining. I do not necessarily buy the sometimes manufactured sounding humility in this production and his ""accent"" seems to vary depending upon his audience, but we overlook the shortcomings in those we admire, right?
  The DVD contains highlights from the original Riverdance show and Michael Flatley's two shows including dance peformances of Feet of Flames in Budapest.
 The DVD is arranged in a long interview format interspersed with performances in a chronological order. Included are clips from his days with the Chieftans, dancing at the Kennedy Center, performing at Eurovision, Riverdance, Lord of the Dance, Feet of Flames, and rehearsals for what may be an upcoming movie/video. The Budapest Feet of Flames performances contain short interviews with some of the dancers. The DVD is arranged in a home moview/documentary format begining with pictures of Michael Flatley's family and childhood all the way through and including performances and photographs from the present.
 There also is a very interesting ""making of"" Feet of Flames which is included as well. One really can get a sense of what it was like making the ""one off"" show. In addition, you get to meet a number of the dancers.
 Certainly this DVD will entertain and delight the loyal fan base, but it is extremely well done, and as with the other DVDs and videos, it can be watched repeatedly. I do not know how long the Irish Dancing craze will last, but I get the feeling its twilight may be near. Any additional worthy videos and performances, therefore, are treasured.
 You will enjoy this one for years to come.",1004659200,75,2242,4.67005076142132

1633528,5,B00005NGAJ,All there dvd's are really good to watch. Micheal Flatley is outstanding where does he get all his energy from. I really love watching these.,1386460800,,141,4.68
1633529,5,B00005NGAJ,"I've always liked Michael Flatley--his persona, his precision, and his perfectionism in his dancing.  He complements this as well with costumes that are colorful and stylish.  His stance in this photo reminds me of a matador ready to dance the pasodouble!  He assumes his character 100%, passionately and with flair, and viewers can tell he's having the time of his life.",1381104000,,371,5.049180327868853
1633530,5,B00005NGAJ,"Terrific really glad I purchased,  music, theatrics and light show are really, really good.  The dancing is just fantastic .",1359072000,,124,5.15
1633531,5,B00005NGAJ,"Having been very disappointed by the what was titled the ""Best of Riverdance"" only to find out that the greatest dancer of the pack was only in maybe two short clips, I searched for something with Michael Flatley in it.  I still can't find the original ""Riverdance"", but I found this!  It was wonderful to watch him dance, he is the best hands down!  It is also a window that provides a peek into the man.  He gives you inside information about himself (like the fact that he was a golden gloves winner).  Get it, you will enjoy it.  I also highly recommend ""Feet of Flames"".  How wonderful to see the best!",1304985600,,607,4.366071428571429
1633532,5,B00005NGAJ,I love this DVD. Anything with Michael Flatley is amazing but you get his perspective on the show and Irish dancing. Great addition to Lord of the Dance and Feet of Flames.,1255478400,,172,4.40625
1633533,5,B00005NGAJ,"Michael Flatly is without a doubt the Lord of Dance! This DVD proves it with these incredible performances at different venues and different times in his career. His commentary is inciteful and the candor is refreshing. We all know he has an ego bigger than a house, but man can he ever dance. These performances are some of his best and a great collection to have. Must have DVD if you are at all interested in Michael Flatly!!",1255046400,,428,4.5
1633534,5,B00005NGAJ,Enjoy all of Flatley's Videos. A lot of variety and quite a bit of background about him and his rise to fame.,1250726400,,109,4.0
1633545,5,B00005NGAJ,"I am so glad they came out with the Gold, it gives us a chance to go behind the scenes, learn more about the dancers and performers, Michael Flatley, and how it all started. Everything starting with the Chieftains all the way to Feet of Flames Budapest. I really wish they made a DVD of the Budapest show! I was there and it was just unbelieveable, so different, yet so Michael Flatley. The crowd was going crazy. His parents were sitting in the first row. Yeah, there was some butt shaking and a lot of high tech involved but everything after the original Lord of the Dance is going to be like that.

Did you know that Michael Flatley was born in Chicago? Was a construction worker? A boxer? He plays the flute? And then just so happens he became one of the greatest Irish dance performers. How did he do it? Just watch the movie! (And follow your dreams, no matter what! ;)",1136592000,,875,4.335365853658536
1633546,5,B00005NGAJ,"I am not going to raise the issue of good taste.  This collection is as flashy and trashy as it gets.  But the content is so good-natured, humorous and tongue-in-cheek, that you refrain from judging Flatley for his lack of class.  One of the final sequences, the ""new and improved"" Stolen Kiss is so over the top, that you can't help laughing.  It got far, far away from Irish-dancing.  It's more like flamenco stip-tease.  You can really tell that Flatley got really tired towards the end of his career.  He doesn't do much dancing.  He just stands in the middle of the stage and lets the troupe dance around him.",1135728000,3,614,4.5181818181818185
1633547,5,B00005NGAJ,"This DVD is worth the price, if only to see the Budapest version of Feet of Flames.  If you saw Feet of Flames Victory Tour, you will enjoy the Budapest section.  The included comments by Michael are great too.  Well worth the price!",1080086400,5,233,4.372093023255814
1633548,5,B00005NGAJ,"Amazing video of the new Feet of Flames including numbers never before seen in Canada and the U.S.
Michael Flately has inspired almost all Irish dancers to better themselves at their art, and this video shows why.
I have been an Irish dancer since I was young, and now have toured in various Irish dance shows thanks to this man. This video is a great tribute.
Slainte!",1048204800,2,369,4.522388059701493
1633549,5,B00005NGAJ,"Michael Flatley Gold is an absolute asset for ANY Irish dance fan!
The DVD is just amazingly done in every aspect which makes for a most spectacular watch for anyone, but even moreso, Flatley fans. It shows all about Michael and bringing himself up to the spectacle he is today, including half an hour of the Feet of Flames Budapest show, which you will see no where else.
Even if you aren't a Irish dance fan, you will enjoy this because of Flatleys sheer power on stage.
Its hard to invision Irish dance coming this far, but it has, and this is the man to thank. In this escapade you will find that Michael is no arrogant dancer and as for his inflated ego? If you read into it, you can find he is a really nice person, and what you see is just alot of character coming out on stage.
Buy this DVD no matter the cost, you will not be disappointed.
Because boy oh boy, this guy can dance...",1046908800,11,890,4.2105263157894735
1633550,2,B00005NGAJ,"As an Irish step dancer who is always trying to set the record straight about what exactly we do, this movie is really frustrating.  Riverdance, and even the first Lord of the Dance, were much better representations of Irish step dance.  This ""Gold"" is not.  ...  Michael Flately *used* to be the best we had to offer.... To any serious Irish dancer, he's a joke.  Yes, he's brought Irish step dance to the forefront, but most of what he does personally is a combination of many different styles.  At least in Riverdance, he kept to mainly Irish choreography.  Movies like this give such a wrong impression to anybody who is not personally involved with Irish dance. ...",1043020800,8,670,4.6752136752136755
1633551,5,B00005NGAJ,"Never saw anything better than this. He is one of a kind. Went to his last performance, that was unforgetable. When he's on stage, you can't breathe, it's just so powerfull, that I cried. He gives all his energy to the audience.",1036195200,9,228,4.4523809523809526
1633552,4,B00005NGAJ,"I found this DVD to be extremely entertaining, if not a bit long. (2hrs, 10 mins.)  The only concern I have is that though the film is not rated, some parents might find a couple of the scenes objectionable for viewing for young children.  I saw the Feet of Flames World Tour live here in L.A. when it came through.  Personally it was very enjoyable, but I was downright embarrassed in the Stolen Kiss scene when Flatley stripped that girl and she jumped on him.  It reminded me a bit of some trashy Vegas show, complete with seductive guitar riffs.  There were YOUNG children in that audience!
Yes, Flatley is a genius, and as an Irish dancer I am in awe of what he has done for my sport, but I felt he could have left his midlife crisis out of an otherwise wholesome performance.  If as a parent you are concerned about what your child will be watching, I would recommend watching the DVD first or skipping tracks.  Otherwise, Gold is a rare treat that can't be passed up!",1015200000,31,974,4.377777777777778

7946930,5,B00005NGAJ,"This is excellent for all of the Michael Flatley reasons: passion, impeccable timing, a true, innovative artist. This is as good as his best: Feet of Flames. You need this for your collection. The man speaks candidly about the naysayers, his childhood, and it will inspire you no matter what level you are at or what medium you use. He is not content to continue replicating himself, which is the mark of a true artist. That love of life and what one does is contagious! I've been going thru a dead spell as a painter and writer - now I am recharged! One more thing: a real rarity: he loves his fans.",1516924800,,600,4.366071428571429
