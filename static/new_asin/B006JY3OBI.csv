4999801,3,B006JY3OBI,"I am a huge fan of previous Lynda LaPlante series, especially Trial and Retribution and Prime Suspect. I had high hopes that this series would be as good or better than her earlier works. This is not the case. The main characters are not particularly gripping or engaging. Kelly Reilly in particular is a very poor substitute for Victoria Smurfit or Helen Mirren. She seems perpetually confused and uncomfortable in her police role, not at all the strong female lead Ms. LaPlante has created so well in the past. I was overall disappointed with this purchase and delighted to see that Ms. LaPlante turned her attention to Series 5 of Trial and Retribution after this misstep.",1340755200,16,675,4.827586206896552
4999802,4,B006JY3OBI,Good Entertainment. It is a modern day look at the Prime Suspect style of police drama. Ciaran Hinds is always worth the money. He was the reason that I actually read the offer to purchase. I have to say that it is worth the money. Both the stories were interesting and held your interest.

4999803,5,B006JY3OBI,"The thing about Britishb TV mysteries is they show the human side of the character -not the silly stuff we see here in the US. Their characters have affairs, drink too much, smoke too much. Plus the stories are not cookie cutter tripe",1334016000,5,234,4.465116279069767
4999804,3,B006JY3OBI,"This series fails the usual outstanding quality level of the La Plante mystery genre, e.g., ""Prime Suspect"" and more recently ""The Commander"" in that it is an obsessive concentration of gore and the grisly and gruesome(a body cut in half) .  ""Prime Suspect"" and ""The Commander"" are the typical outstanding interwoven, high-quality plots written, acted, filmed, and directed with the amazing skill and excellence of British crime-drama videos.  The emphasis on The two previous tales is in the mystery itself.  I was extremely disappointed with ""Above Suspicion, Set one"".

Lovely Reilly plays the role so well, sassy and wanting to be first-rate, but making rookie gaffs. So if you've a weak stomach, you may decide to give this a miss. If you can take the graphic scenes, then you'll also find some top acting by regulars and guest stars of gritty London crime, by author/screenplay writer/producer Lynda La Plante, well known also for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prime-Suspect-The-Complete-Collection/dp/B0028AEO0M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prime Suspect: The Complete Collection</a>. At least reviewers can't complain the film writer took too many liberties with the book, since they are the same person.

ABOVE SUSPICION (book title & series in 2 parts) 114 min WITH SUBTITLES
Pt 1: An 8 year female victim murder series, each alike & brutal, then one exception. Travis goes undercover to end the carnage. DCI Langton (Ciaran Hinds-Amazing Grace) heads a team with Travis a young, rookie, shapely cop with taut blouse and loads to learn-like stemming gag reflex. John Savident is one guest star in this series.
Pt 2: It's a ballet night as Anna is undercover with suspect Daniels (Jason Durr). A trap's set, but some of the HOT action moves to HQ, twixt she and Langton.
Bonus on disc 1: 2 text filmographies, La Plante text bio; photos; Videos with subtitles of Making the Show-6 min, Meet the Creator-4 min, Behind the Scenes Pt1-7 min of realistic recreation of a decomposed body, Behind the Scenes Pt2-6min of Durr's character.

THE RED DAHLIA (book title & series in 3 parts) 140 min WITH SUBTITLES
Pt. 1 Based on true story, model Louise Pennell body found halved & mutilated. Reporter
Reynolds (Edward MacLiam) gets note indicating a murder link to decades-old unsolved Black Dahlia case. New murder dubbed Red Dahlia. Copycat?
Pt 2: Reporter gets victims handbag as well as a date with ethics-naive Anna with proves disastrously conflicting. Perpetrator contact warns of a new victim. Langton's press embargo ignored by Reynolds. Anonymous caller names Col Wickenham (Simon Williams-Upstairs Downstairs), retired surgeon, with alibi. Another star appears as a maid (Sylvia Syms-The Queen).
Pt 3: Phone tap on Wickenham helps, as do photos Anna secures of sex party. Expect the unexpected in this bizarre dysfunctional family and case finale.

It's unrated by UK but definitely adult's only (with strong stomach) due to graphic violence & images, nudity mostly prosthetic, and language. If you want more, perhaps read the books, even the Director complained about having to leave out bits, in this over-the-top suspense on the grimy side of murder.",1326412800,34,3620,5.661141804788214

4999823,5,B006JY3OBI,"ABOVE SUSPICION, Set 1. (2009-13). From Lynda La Plante, creator of PRIME SUSPECT, the British mystery television series starring Helen Mirren, that was such a massive worldwide hit, comes ABOVE SUSPICION, another British television series made by ITV that is based on the bestselling work of La Plante, a former cop.  This first series of this fine police procedural is based on the authors ABOVE SUSPICION; the author also served as screenwriter on the series.  The crime drama appears to be set in the current day, in London, as the cop shop on which it focuses is assigned to the London Metropolitan, better known as the Met. The entertainment has been called a younger, sassier successor to PRIME SUSPECT by The Telegraph of London. The series ran in the U.K. for four seasons, 2009-13, but has not been seen in North America.  This boxed set gives us two discs, with two feature-length mysteries running approximately 254 minutes. Plus Series 1 behind the scenes segments, a series 2 making-of featurette, cast interviews and a Lynda La Plante biography.  Also, a warning, for mature audiences only, contains violence and coarse language. And, thank goodness, and let me blow a kiss to RLJ Entertainment and Acorn, who have released the set; subtitles, or else what would those of us on this side of the pond do with that quick London cross-chat?  The production is also available in streaming format.  I received this as a review copy.

One her first day on the job, rookie detective Anna Travis (played by rising star Kelly Reilly, BLACK BOX, SHERLOCK HOLMES) throws up at a crime scene and faints at a postmortem. Does she have what it takes to succeed in policing, still mostly a man's world?  With the veteran Ciarn Hinds (GAME OF THRONES; TINKER TAILOR SOLDIER SPY) as DCI Langton, as her brusque boss? Theres no question but that Hinds has developed into a middle-aged actor with the chops and the gravitas to carry the series, and that he and Reilly, unusually beautiful even among  beautiful actresses, with her lush body and fine featured face, produce smoldering chemistry.  The acting is universally strong. The elements of the cop shop seem accurately portrayed; the script and photography are sharp and hard-edged.  Somehow the gorgeous Reilly does not seem out of place in the precinct, perhaps because, or in spite of the fact that it is not universally peopled by pretty boys and girls, as an American detective show would be.

The episodes are, with thanks to Acorn:

Part 1
For eight years, someone has been murdering women, following the same brutal ritual each time. The most recent victim doesnt fit the profile, but evidence links her to the others. Anna volunteers to go undercover to crack the case.

Part 2
Langton allows Anna to spend an evening at the ballet with the prime suspect, a handsome actor on the brink of stardom. A discovery at the place where one of the victims lived helps Anna set a trap. Meanwhile, sparks fly between Anna and Langton.

The scripts are thrilling, tense, taut and absorbing, full of twists and turns while featuring cleanly-drawn characters. The two stars have robust, convincing chemistry.  Mind you, this is an undeniably commercial production that sometimes leans to the gothic. It  is hardly set among real folk: the prime suspect here is an extremely handsome young actor who appears ready for stardom.  Still, we found the show absorbing, gobbled it up  in this house quick as we  could.  Recommended.",1424995200,,3473,4.892491467576792

4999827,1,B006JY3OBI,"If you love those beautifully produced British who-done-its and detective dramas (e.g. Poirot, Foyle's War) You will probably hate this as much as I did. Part one was actually promising, even though there was only one plausible suspect who was obviously guilty. It looks like they ran out of budget and just couldn't afford any more actors or set designers so they spent what seems like the entire second episode in the interrogation room with the guilty guy talking dirty about having sex with his mother and a dead person. I think it was trying to be edgy; it was excruciatingly dumb and boring.  A 9 year old might find it interesting. It went on forever. I don't know how it ended. This was the first movie I had seen with Ciaran Hinds which was not excellent. None of the character interactions made sense.  If humans lived, on average, a thousand years, this still wouldn't be worth five minutes of your time.",1411776000,,915,4.6419753086419755

4999850,2,B006JY3OBI,"Pretty bad.  Maybe because I've just finished watching season I of ""The Fall,"" a series that covers ground similar to ""Above Suspicion."" But this show struck me as shallow, implausible and gratuitously grisly.  The acting in AS is not good: even Ciarn Hinds seems to be coasting on bellowing.  His performance is hollow.  Kelly Reilly has a few moments, but in a climactic scene in the first episode her performance consists almost entirely of her casting big sad blue eyes upwards and whispering.  There's nobody home.  The story lines, too, are trite and cliche ridden.  Only actor Jason Durr, as a film star under suspicion, succeeds with a  memorable performance that is both daring and original.",1403827200,3,700,4.974137931034483
4999851,2,B006JY3OBI,"This is the first Lynda La Plante show that I have disliked.  The two main characters are forced together in an incredulous boss/employee situation, that insults the acting ability of  all concerned.  The shows are gritty to the point where you wonder if someone sat around trying to think up the most distasteful scenarios.  The writing is substandard and the hairstyle on the female lead will drive you mad after a while.  I know this is supposed to be part of the shtick, but I couldn't stand it.  I do not recommend this show.",1403654400,,530,4.585106382978723
4999852,5,B006JY3OBI,This short series hooked me immediately.  I've been ordering more and more DVD sets of English programming because drama series here in the US are so bad of late. Kelly Reilly is marvelous. Ciaran Hinds is a great antithesis in his gruffness to her gentle approach to investigation.,1401840000,,282,4.875
4999853,4,B006JY3OBI,I like the characters and the actors that played the parts.  The plots are pretty good.  I will get more.,1397692800,,105,4.2
4999854,5,B006JY3OBI,"Lynda La Plante continues her astounding output as a writer of the finest crime dramas seen on television. ABOVE SUSPICION is even more impressive because it is based on her own novels. This first box set of five episodes (Set 1 is two episodes and Set 2 is three) is thoroughly gripping, impeccably produced and flawlessly acted.

Never one to shy away from gritty realism, La Plante outdoes herself here, especially in the drama based on her novel the THE RED DAHLIA. Its as graphic as anything Ive ever seen and very disturbing. Fortunately Ms. La Plante also understands how to tell a morality tale as well, for without a satisfying conclusion, audiences would otherwise be overwhelmed by the unrelenting bleakness of her stories. That is not the case here, and although women are victims, they are also the victors.

Speaking of women, it is central to every La Plante creation that strong women characters feature prominently in the stories. While there is no doubt she has done much to advance the cause of feminism, La Plante is no soapbox advocate. She simply writes good stories, and her female protagonists are simply part of those stories. No preaching, just good storytelling. There is much to be said for this in light of the political agenda found in so many programs today.

Ciaran Hinds plays the gruff DCI James Langton and he brings a weight and depth to the show that keeps the storys intensity at a high pitch throughout. He is perfectly balanced opposite gorgeous and wonderfully talented Kelly Reilly, who has been making a splash as Jude Laws Dr Watsons wife in the first two Robert Downey Jr Sherlock Holmes films. The supporting cast is excellent and the style of the show, with its use of frequent contrapuntal cutting between scenes is very effective and distinct from the visual style of some of her other shows, most notably TRIAL & RETRIBUTION, which used split screen to great effect.

La Plantes stamp is all over this series and that means, among other things, lots of DVD extras. As a producer, La Plante knows that audiences want to know what goes on behind the scenes, and when spectacularly graphic makeup effects are created, its fun to see how they are made. Such features remind us that this is not reality, but an entertainment and, although shocking and brutal aspects are invariably part of a La Plante drama, we can rest assured that no one was really hurt and it is all make-believe.

Acorn Media, that fast-growing distributor of quality British programming, has again provided closed captioning for the deaf and hard of hearing, ensuring that their ever-widening audience excludes no one. It never hurts either, as the dialogue is often sharp and the plots are intricate. Not to mention the various British accents. Captioning ensures we don't miss a word. Theres a reason Acorn Media has recently obtained the majority rights to Agatha Christies collected works. They want to do things right. By choosing another Lynda La Plante opus, they have once again demonstrated their penchant for choosing quality programming.",1397433600,,3066,4.89980732177264

4999869,4,B006JY3OBI,"I have some sympathy with those reviewers who complain of the scenes of slaughtered victims in the first set of this series -- at its heart, it's a solid police procedural, with an effective performance by Ciaran Hinds, always an engaging actor to watch, and after being wasted in the ""Tinker, Tailor"" movie (not given enough to do), here he comes across as a take-charge, impatient, but not insensitive man, although I would note that in the second story (""The Red Dahlia"" Disc 2), he is made to come across as a bit of a bully, which was not the case in the first story.  The young prize-winning stage actress Kelly Reilly is the rookie foil to Hinds's experienced DCI.  She's Anna Travis, supposedly the daughter of a policemen much respected by Hinds's character, James Langton, and in the first story (Disc 1), she makes all the rookie mistakes but shows good intuition and comes through in the end.  I thought Kelly Reilly was a bit pallid in the role at first.  She's a pretty woman, but her face isn't particularly expressive, so we'll have to see how she gets used to working for cameras.  It's my impression that her ""Red Dahlia"" performance was a bit stronger, but maybe I was just getting used to her.  Neither her character nor Hinds's is given much of a backstory -- so it's all on the surface, and presumably by the time we get to episodes 4, 5, and 6 or so, the earlier episodes will be the backstory.  Nothing wrong with that -- I look forward to see how Langton manages to negotiate his affair with his boss ( a very good looking woman with a chilly efficiency) while obviously being drawn erotically to someone junior to him.

Violent and ugly imagery is especially prevalent in the first story (Disc 1), and it's hard to see that we need all of it.  The fact that the victims are women makes it all a bit voyeuristic too, in an ugly way.  The police work is so routine -- without car chases and shootings or even fights -- that maybe the director thought the basic plot of solving the crimes too tame.  We're given the disturbing images mainly as flashback -- as memories of or imaginings of a series of crimes committed over a number of years, and yes, we do understand that the perpetrator (who thinks himself ""above suspicion"") is a really bad dude.  Granted that some scenes and images might put some people off, the film is nonetheless effectively directed and shot, and the ensemble cast around the leads in the operations room is just fine.

It's interesting that both of the first two stories in this series focus on serial killings of women, so the sense that ""we must get him before he kills again"" is a strong motivator of suspense.  It's also interesting that in different ways the bad guys meet their ends before justice can be fully served through normal channels in courts of law ( and the cases are watertight).  Britain has no capital punishment, and I wonder if the genre requires that particularly nasty serial killers have to die before trial.  One used to hear phrases like ""Hanging's too good for him,"" and people who feel that about such criminals would certainly feel that life in prison is FAR too good for them!  I'll be watching Set 2 (presumably the third story in the series) to see how plots and characters develop.  I say it's worth watching, but just be aware that some of it requires a strong stomach.",1384560000,,3354,4.543189368770764
4999870,5,B006JY3OBI,"I have always been a fan of Lynda LaPlant`s work.  She writes the most believable stories and always seems to have the perfect cast to perform them.  I remember seeing her in a documentary years ago, where she was talking to policemen and forensic scientists to ensure that what she was writing  was correct and could happen.  All that goundwork has obviously paid off. I must say that some of her stories are horrific and I have been known to sometimes shut my eyes!!

Some interesting interviews with cast and crew are on the disc, and, show how the excellent writing rubs off onto everyone as they are all challenged to perform at their very best.
