2728217,4,B000MCH57W,"I just finished doing this dvd.  The first thing I want to tell you is that this is a modern dance class for dancers only. Don't buy this DVD if you have NEVER taken modern dance classes before.  It will be too fast for you.  That said here is what is on the dvd.

Setting:  Dance studio with linoleum floors, wall mirror, ballet barres.  As is the case with most dance studios in New York, the room looks like it has seen a lot of dance classes (translation, the walls and door could use a coat of paint)

Production: There is a sound echo.  This dvd does not use any dvd features.  No menu, you'll have to use the fast forward button like a vhs tape.

Class:  8 dancers (and I mean REAL dancers) Young energetic and quite flexible.  This is an advanced beginner modern dance class.  I never quite understood what advanced beginner meant, but I guess if you have never danced then this class is not for you. Inflexible, 2 left feet...skip it.

Music: Percussion

Choreography:  There is an extensive warm-up that get progressively harder, but you can get it with determination.  There is little instruction from the teacher.  She assumes that you already have a grasp of the Horton technique.  I suggest that you be mindful of your knees.  The only on the floor work is the coccyx balance which is quite hard, but something to work up to. Luckily she does the ab work in 2 groups so you can rest while the other group works.

There is no choreography to learn, but instead a 20 minute or so improvisation session in which you are asked to roll like a baby, crawl like a toddler, walk, skip, gallop and slide; then dance to different emotions. Then the students one at a time give one word for everyone to dance to, ie wind or mouse.  Then you are instructed on walking in different directions.  It is described as a directional exercise.

Next section is the hardest in my opinion.  It is going across the floor incorporating what you learned in the center floor work. Hops, hop jumps, side pulls, side pulls with lateral T, Jumps.  Turns.  Hard stuff!! And confusing.  Even some of dancers kept turning in the wrong direction.  I remember when I used to take dance classes that I dreaded going across the floor in twos. My current living room  isn't large enough for the across the floor work. It goes pretty fast and I wish I had a step button on my dvd so that I could slow down the movement.

Teachers:  One teacher instructs the warmup and center work; another teacher leads the improvisation.  Both are very nice and knowledgeable.

Space:  You will need LOTS space going across the floor. YOU CAN NOT DO THIS CLASS IN A SMALL ROOM!!! And oh by the way don't do this on carpet.  Hard wood floor is best.

The class ends with a final center floor standing exercise and that's it.  No stretching. No cool down. No choreography

Overall:  This is a dance class from beginning to end.  I don't think it was made as a workout but you can modify it to a workout. Going across the floor will tire you out, if you can get the  steps. It probably would have worked better if the dancers faced away from you, like you were in the back of class.  That way you could follow the dancers in front of you.  As such, they do not do mirror image to you.  The camera is in front of the dancers.  The only time you get to see them from behind  is when they face away from the camera. This causes a problem. Do you do mirror image to them or use the same foot they use?  When they go across the floor, you can only really see what's going on when they go from left to right, or down stage to up stage.  You will need to add a cool down on your own.  I just ordered the intermediate dvd hoping that there is more floor work that I can add onto this class.

I could see that over time, I could work up to this especially across the floor.  However, I think this dvd is best for people to use to supplement their horton modern dance classes and not as a stand alone.  You need a teacher to correct your form if you are interested in that sort of thing.

As a current non-dancer, who hasn't been in a modern dance class in years, this dvd will be a challenge for me, but I will definitely add it to my weekly rotation and since I live in a city that doesn not have modern dance classes (no longer in SF)I'll have to wait until I visit NY and take an advanced beginner horton dance class. At least I'll know what to expect!",1178150400,57,4405,4.268765133171913
8167866,5,B000MCH57W,Just what I expected. Teaching a Horton class and the perfect review footage.,1526342400,,77,5.0
8167867,5,B000MCH57W,Very good if you have a dance background,1510099200,,40,4.125
8167868,4,B000MCH57W,Great! Finally a modern dance class that doesn't come across like 'for those who can't cut it in ballet' snobbishness.  This video is both an excellent practice aid and inspirational means for exploring other forms of modern dance styles.  (I think I'm in love with dance again:).,1469750400,,280,4.9361702127659575
8167869,4,B000MCH57W,"I've been dancing as an adult off and on for the past 4 years.  Now I am consistently taking a weekly adult class and our instructor teaches quite a bit of the Horton technique, so I purchased this in hopes of supporting what I'm learning and taking an additional class each week.  This DVD has not disappointed me yet.  I have 2 critiques:  1) I wish there were chapters so I could easily move from the warm ups to class  2) the instructor talks very low and fast so I'm struggling to hear the vocabulary but with repetition and a good notebook I'm sure I'll get it.  I haven't made it beyond the warm-up yet - but again I'm already very pleased and feeling stronger after 1 week of slowly doing the 10 minutes of the warm up then the next day doing 20 minutes.  I'll increase until I get through it all to make sure I understand it and it works for my physically.

On a great side note the warm ups are already helping with my lower back pain - in short I like this one a lot!",1436140800,2,978,4.110526315789474
8167870,5,B000MCH57W,This is excellent!  I have been taking liturgical dance classes for a couple of years now.  This is excellent at teaching you the correct way to do the movements.  I love it!  I am becoming a much stronger dancer!!,1393891200,4,214,4.410256410256411
8167871,2,B000MCH57W,Not exactly what I was looking for. I was hoping for modern dance routines or patterns instead it was more of a modern dance stretch dvd.,1372377600,,137,4.3076923076923075
8167872,5,B000MCH57W,I have been a dance teacher for 30 years and have studied many forms of dance and many methods.  I wanted to give my students an idea of how modern dance was developed and this is the perfect tool.  I am anxious to start using the exercises from the Lester Horton methods with them and know they have learned a historic part of the modern dance revolution.,1344470400,,356,4.298507462686567
8167873,5,B000MCH57W,"If you are not a professional dancer but you have a little technique, this is the right thing! I like it!! Yay!",1258588800,,111,4.090909090909091
8167874,3,B000MCH57W,"This is a good DVD.  I am always looking for ways to challenge my body, and at the same time learn new dance technique as well.  I am intrigued by Hortons Technique because it encourages full range of motion with the body.  And it is challenging.  The DVD is 90minutes.  It is an actual class.  There are several dancers that are from the Aileys dance company that are taking the class. I feel the teachers were very thorough with making sure that they were clear in what they wanted the dancers to do and they were very good at demonstrating how they wanted things to be done, by using other dancers that had the correct form of the technique.  If you have never done Hortons Technique (like me) I recommend purchasing The Warm Up before this DVD.  Because they take more time in explaining the different moves.",1199836800,9,812,4.476190476190476
