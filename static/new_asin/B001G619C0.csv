3596648,4,B001G619C0,I love all the Mummy flicks!! It's just unfortunate that when a bargain like this comes around you can not get it in full screen format!  Bummer,1230768000,,144,4.333333333333333
3596649,1,B001G619C0,"If you plan on viewing this on a PS3, buyer beware. It does not have audio. Read the other reviews and decide if this is worth it. We tried all the DVDs in the trilogy and there is no audio during the film, only when you fast forward it. The bonus features do have audio, as well as the menu, but that was not really why we bought it. We tried updating our player to see if that helped, sadly it did not. Hopefully I can return this; we bought it at best buy.",1230508800,,459,3.893617021276596

3596651,1,B001G619C0,"Warning to those with older Receivers. This Blu-ray disk only has a DTS audio soundtrack in English. If you have a Receiver, like I do, that only decodes Dolby Digital 5.1, there is no audio output.

The rest of this review is for the clueless producers of this Blu-ray disk. Obviously they have learned nothing from the costly lost sales of the war with HD-DVD. People like me are not going to buy an expensive new Receiver just to play a particular movie on Blu-ray. Especially with six audio formats to cover and perhaps more to come! I will rent this movie on DVD and wait for the audio wars to end. Since Blu-ray has plenty of capacity, I do not see any reason why an English Dolby 5.1 soundtrack could not be included to ensure backwards compatibility. Particularly since Dolby 5.1 is already provided on this disk in other languages. From reading various blogs and reviews, I know I am not the only potential lost sale.",1230249600,3,926,4.544910179640719

3596653,3,B001G619C0,"The first two movies were good.

Mummy 3:

Worst movie of the three by far.

The only redeeming quality of this movie were the Yeti's, but other than that another summer flop along with Indiana Jones. The woman replacing Rachel was TERRIBLE in this role.

Watched the Blu-ray last night and thought it LOOKED good and I would give the movie another chance, but just...no....

3596742,5,B001G619C0,"This is for the DVD collection:

#1:  This movie puts the original Universal Mummy to shame. It's been turned into a swashbuckling, live action flick with enough one-liners and derring-do to satisfy all. Not one character in this movie is found wanting, from the mummy himself, who's portrayed as sexy for a change as well as being very much included in the action, to the mercenary and cowardly Beni are well-cast and brilliantly played. Great special effects, some lovely desert scenery, and a great deal of hairs-breadth escapes make this a rousing adventure tale instead of a ""horror"" movie, which is exactly what it should've been all along.

#2: This sequel, while not quite reaching the pinnacle of the first, is still pretty good.  It all boils down to the usual theme. The Mummy is being resurrected and he's still trying to reanimate his beloved also.  The only way to stop him is by resurrecting another creature, the Scorpion King, a long-dead warrior who is presumably the only one who can defeat Imhotep because he has Anubis God of the Underworld on his side. The Rock as the scorpion king is onscreen only briefly, prepping for his own movie later and his appearances at the end are animated. More's the pity.

#3: The title of this movie is misleading. It isn't really part of the Mummy franchise but is capitalizing on that title. To have it included here, the entire collection should've been called ""The Adventures of Rick O'Connell."" While it is another rousing adventure, half of the original cast is missing. and this story focuses a good deal on the son's adventures when his parents get involved in an adventure in China. Along with the rise of the terracotta warriors placed in the tomb, everything's thrown in except the kitchen sink... Still, it's a good film...if you keep it separate from the original two.

This collection was viewed from a purchased DVD and no remuneration was involved in the writing of this review.",1462147200,2,1949,4.817365269461078

The Mummy [1999] In 1925, in the Sahara Desert, a group of treasure hunters stumble on a 3,000 year old tomb and the mummified incarnation of an Egyptian priest out for revenge: As punishment for killing Pharaoh Seti and sleeping with his mistress, Egyptian priest Imhotep was mummified alive and cursed. But in 1923 he is inadvertently resurrected by treasure hunters and must be stopped before he can wreak his final vengeance on the world.

The Mummy Returns [2001] Ten years after the events of the first film, Rick [Brendan Fraser] and Evelyn [Rachel Weisz] O'Connell are settled in 1935 London, where they are raising their son. When a chain of events finds the corpse of Imhotep [Arnold Vosloo] resurrected, the O'Connells go on a desperate race to save the world from unspeakable evil and to rescue their son before it is too late.

The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor [2008] Taking off the wraps once more, but this time the action moves to China for round three of the Mummy adventure. For 2,000 years the ruthless Chinese Dragon Emperor [Jet Li] and his vast army of warriors have been frozen in time, cast in clay, waiting for their moment to rise again. When young archaeologist Alex O'Connell [Luke Ford] is duped into bringing the ancient warlord back to life, he soon realises he has to call in the only people he knows with experience and knowledge of how to battle the undead and his parents, father Rick [Brendan Fraser] and mother Evelyn [Maria Bello]. As the emperor attempts to re-unite with his massed warriors and finally fulfil his dream of world domination, Alex and his family, along with mystical, high-kicking sorceress Zi Juan [Michelle Yeoh] and a rival cast of undead, have to pull out all the stops to keep the evil tyrant from achieving his ends.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: Now that the third film The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor in the franchise has now been added to this Blu-ray 3 Film Collection, it is now time to give my opinions on these 3 Films. And what better way to do so than to give them a royal treatment, which is so filled with riches, that even the boy king Tutankhamen would want them in his Blu-ray video collection?

Normally this would be the part of the review where Id summarise the story, but Im thinking if you're reading this, then you are already pretty familiar with Rick OConnell [Brendan Fraser] and his adventure seeking pals. Suffice it to say, these aren't your granddaddys original black-and-white Mummy films. Each of these modern-day offerings is packed to the gills with amazing special effects, cool creatures, high adventure, and enough action for ten other films.

Seeing them all in the full 1080p encoded images is nothing short of glorious. It is films like these that really make the Blu-ray hi-definition format shine. Every single thing on the screen, every bit of dried and rotting flesh, every amazing landscape are all brought to life in what can only be described as stunning detail. If you ever thought to yourself that there wasn't that much of a difference between standard-definition 480i and 1080p, prepare to have your mind changed and blown away. You just cannot help but stare at the screen and have a big grinning smile.

As for the Special Features and Extras, holy cow, these releases are packed to the gill! Most of the older extras from their previous DVD release make it back, there are a couple of things that appear on both of these releases, and then of course there are the Blu-ray goodies lurking about and check out the details below.

Theres no doubt with the advent of the Blu-ray technology is changing the way we watch films. From the crystal clear images, has to be seen to be believed picture quality to the amazing sound mixes and the overall depth of interactivity between film and supplement material, theres just nothing like it. Whether you're a fan of the series or you simply want to see what your shiny new player can do, these releases are a must-buy that you absolutely shouldnt miss!

Blu-ray Video Quality  Universal Studios presents THE MUMMY TRILOGY on Blu-ray high definition for the first time in a simply stunning 1080p encode images, plus an aspect ratio of 2.35:1 and 2.40:1. Universal Studios has certainly done themselves proud for what was their debut on the Blu-ray format. THE MUMMY TRILOGY remains impressive not only in its foreground detail, but medium-wide objects and background information is handsomely rendered as well. Human characters need not be up-close and centre-framed to see the remarkable detail present on them; medium-wide shots of faces show off every pore, facial hair and bead of sweat with lifelike clarity. Detail in rocks, statues, faades, and even the sand on the desert floor is all top-flight and looks life like realism in the textured appearance. A slight amount of grain covers the image and adds to the deep, theatrical quality of the movie. Once again, Universal Studio has delivered nearly perfect images, one that fans everywhere are going to love. Universal Studio has consistently released high-quality Blu-ray releases and dedication to the format.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Studios THE MUMMY TRILOGY smashes onto Blu-ray with an excellent 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack. The audio tracks on the 3 Blu-ray discs are a totally perfect complement to the pristine video 1080p transfer, and it never misses a sonic beat. The film's score on the 3 Film Collection are totally powerful and very engaging, even more so thanks to its presentation in a the DTS-HD format. Every speaker is utilised, and while the scores are firmly entrenched up front, the rear channels are active and carry the soundtrack, too, completing the experience. The battle scenes in all the films features excellent dynamics sounds. Whenever gunshots ring loud and true and the chaos of the battle scenes in all 3 films fills every speaker and rattles the subwoofer. More mundane sounds, like flowing water over the side of boats, the slightest bit of audible music in the background is played, and the squeaking and squealing of animals are all meticulously placed and adds a realistic atmosphere to the all scenes. Indeed, atmospherics are generally first-rate throughout the soundtrack on all 3 films. The film music and action sound effects play in perfect harmony, both presented at the perfect volume, one in relation to the other, and as fun and adventurous as the films by themselves, the music and effects make it all the more entertaining listening experience. All the soundtracks on all the films create a totally natural explosive experience, and very satisfying experience it is, especially as shots are fired and come from every direction. Short bursts of automatic gunfire and single shots from lever and bolt-action rifles scream out from every corner, all coming together to form action-scene harmony in all 3 films. Dialogue reproduction is practically pitch-perfect in every scene. These are A-grade soundtracks and Universal's ever-growing list of reference quality Blu-ray soundtracks, are one of the finest listens on Blu-ray today.

Finally, The Mummy film franchise has been a staple diet of cinema and home video for almost a decade. Whether through official sequels or spinoff films, fans of the franchise have always had their appetite for more Mummy-centric action fulfilled in one form or another. Although the trio of official Mummy films have regressed one after the other in a fairly linear fashion, each offers plenty to enjoy, particularly from an action and special-effects perspective. The change in director and the replacement of a key star in the third film certainly spelled trouble for the franchise. While the film retains much of the charm, special effects wizardry, and action that defined the first two films, Tomb of the Dragon Emperor lacks in spirit, vitality, and perhaps most important, in its script. It's a shame to see the franchise go out on a sour note, if this is indeed the end. Universal Pictures entrusted this series in the capable hands of Blu-ray, and all three films are now forever preserved with nearly impeccable and certainly reference-grade quality, available at the whim of fans everywhere looking and sounding about as good as the days the debuted in theatres. Across the board, the films offer first rate visuals and dynamic soundtracks, along with plenty of special features that should keep any serious Mummy fan busy for some time. Despite the downturn in quality of the sequels, particularly the third film, the Mummy trilogy makes a fine addition to any Blu-ray collection, and this set is the perfect way to indulge in all three films. The only really negative aspect to the film The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor is that they replaced the really excellent actress Rachel Weisz, with the equally useless actress Maria Bello, who I thought was totally dreadful, as well as totally wooden and couldn't act her way out of a wet paper bag, as since that film, I have never seen her anymore in any other films, so just shows you how untalented she is. Why couldn't they have persuaded Rachel Weisz to appear one last time in this final franchise film and pay the money that Rachel Weisz was asking for, as I felt it left me slightly cold and wanting more out of this film, but despite this slightly negative aspect of the film, it was still a good rollercoaster film and the other actors helped to make the film turn out to be a good 3rd and final Mummy film. By the way, did they think the public would be fooled by Universal Pictures decision to change the actress, come on Universal Pictures we are not that dumb or idiots? Highly Recommended!

3596896,4,B001G619C0,"My fascination with Egypt has made me always like these movies. The blu ray case is cheap plastic as usual so I had to replace the case (but that is so normal to me I have blank dvd, ps3, xbox 360, and blu ray cases). These cases are a bit more expensive to replace since it is a 3 disc case, but if you are building your collection you might as well buy blank cases because whether I go to the store and buy them or order online I get a LOT of broken cases. Back to the movies though because many don't care about the cases. The blu ray transfer was great. surround sound and big screen HD are both fantastic.",1402963200,4,610,4.008196721311475

3596898,4,B001G619C0,"I suddenly had the desire to see The Mummy after all these years.  I remember how much I loved it.  I remember how impressive the beginning shot was where it opens on Ancient Egypt, and you see all these little people working on buildings.  I thought how it amazing special effects were getting.  The first movie is my favorite.  I liked the sequels well enough.  I was a bit disappointed when Rachel Weisz didn't return to play Evy in the third movie, but the actress who replaced her did a good job.

I personally am a big fan of digital copies now.  I don't have to store anything, clean anything--and I don't have to worry about scratches.  This is a major problem, particularly as DVD cases are getting flimsier.  My mom, though, wanted all three movies...and frankly it was just cheaper to buy it in DVD form.  However, I did have a problem with The Mummy Returns disk.  It froze for a few minutes in the middle.  It didn't seem dirty or scratched.  However, the problem is that I don't know if it is a problem with the disk or a problem with my TV.  My TV is quite old (it still has a VHS player with a DVD).  The freezing did resolve itself, and the movie continued.",1402531200,,1174,4.31651376146789
3596899,5,B001G619C0,"This order arrived a day or two (2) late and I had tracked it and not received any updates to my phone. Then when I got it, it was in this beautiful boxed set and they sent two (2) Dragon Emperor's Tomb! I contacted Amazon.com for return because I have had to return damaged product before and selected ""not what I ordered"" and found out it wouldnt let me just return the one (1) DVD and get the replacement DVD The Mummy that had been omitted from order shipped BUT listed on shipping order. I contacted Amazon.com by phone and got the sweetest softest spoken female that explained it had been shipped from 3rd party and Amazon had no control over their return policies. I told her how much of a hassle it was for me, being disabled, to get a ride to Post Office, since I don't get mail delivered to my house, get a big USPS bos and spend it priority for the insurance and tracking options. She said that Amazon had The Mummy Special Edition on their shelves and could be sent overnight to make up for it being late and the wrong products.  I was delighted and said that would be great but I had POBox and there was no overnight delivery to POBoxes. So she asked if it was okay to send 2-3 day delivery. I said after all the trouble and great customer care from her, that would be fine.  Amazon.com really bends over backwards to see that their customers are satisfied and happy, regardless of the price of the item. I like that in an organisation and signed up for Amazon.com card and got $30 credit on my next order. Very pleased customer here!",1401840000,,1547,4.312714776632302

3596915,4,B001G619C0,"Should be noted that all three DVD movies are included in one single case on separate ""flappers"" inside the case. I didn't watch the features, only the movies, but everything worked great. The Mummy Trilogy is enjoyable, but looses it's roots by the last movie. If you have the Scorpion King, it should be watched after the first movie, as the Scorpion King is material of the second movie.

I abandoned Blu-ray after I found it to be too restrictive of a format. Hardcore DRM that requires firmware updates via Sony servers and limited access to view your disks anywhere you want. Slow loading times and the security risk and less than stellar quality of the players. I now own an upscaling DVD player and have HD TV service, and I'm 100% satisfied as are many others.

Digital downloads like Amazon's service and cheap DVDs and upscaling players have all but killed Blu-ray. Sony is desperate now to the point of manipulating sales numbers and putting ""plants"" on sites like Amazon to try and boost sales. DVD's are outselling Blu-ray 3 to 1 now but Sony has a plan to manipulate those numbers by including the DVD with the Blu-Ray...it counts totally as a Blu-Ray sale and thus manipulates the numbers.",1389744000,3,1205,4.706161137440758

All three films star Brendan Fraser but the original is the strongest by far. This trilogy is so much fun because it has a Raiders of the Lost Ark feel. Overall, the picture quality is great and the audio is even better. The real problem is that there is roughly 3 hours of total bonus content but they are fairly bland and mostly identical to the DVD supplements. The franchise really needs a decent 3-hour making of documentary. The DVD Trilogy was a 4 star release at the time but more is expected for Blu-ray. These are 4 star films in a 2 star package.

3596967,4,B001G619C0,"These films follow in the footsteps of Indiana Jones but with a modern twist.

The Mummy (1999) follows Brenden Frasier and Rachel Weisz as a mercenary and archeologist that get wrapped up in uncovering a cursed mummy.

The Mummy Returns (2001) follows Frasier and Weisz and their son as the Mummy comes back to enact his revenge.  This film includes Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as the Scorpion King, an ancient warrior that holds the power to destroy the world.

The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor (2008) follows Frasier and Maria Bello (a cast change from Weisz as the same character) and their now much older son as the ancient dragon emperor (Jet Li) is resurrected to bring doom upon the world.

These movies are great little adventure films with a PG-13 rating and plenty of comedy.  They could be a bit scary for youngsters but decent films for pre-teens, teenagers and adults alike.  The picture and sound quality of these films are good but improve with each installment.  The only downside, other than the casting change, is that the second disc of special features is not included for any of the three films.

I recommend this set.",1366588800,4,1143,4.732323232323233

It was excellent, I was wrong about Brendon Fraser, he was actually good in the leading role. The action was amazing, at the time it was cutting edge graphics. The story was typical bad guys chasing the good guys over lost fortune. However, it was well written & quite enjoyable. The second movie was also good & was one of the first movies that the ROCK was in. He pulled it off as the Scorpion King. Brendon Fraser returned and also was excellent yet again in the sequel. The last movie had Jet Li as the Emperor who had a curse put on him & again Brendon Fraser goes head to head against the evil bad guy.

So mummies impact this family's dynamics.  The parents are eventually estranged from their son, but reconcile in the Dragon Emperor.

Mummies and what they do are horrible, but they also enable these three people to become a ""family"".

Each of these movies also has a 'behind the scenes' disc which explain how the special affects were made and how the actors interacted with things that did not exist.  Just watching them is worthwhile in themselves.",1362528000,,680,4.760683760683761

3597015,5,B001G619C0,"When I bought Van Helsing which had the monstrous trio of Dracula, Frankenstein and the Werewolf, I realized the Mummy was missing from the monster squad.  So when I had the opportunity, I bought the Mummy trilogy blu-ray boxset.  I wasn't disappointed as the 3 films provided thrilling entertainment with the highest audio-visual quality.  The 1080p high definition graphics brought out the sharpest and minutest details.  For example, you can see the fine sand particles blowing as the Mummy transforms himself into sand and then disperses at will.  Each film also comes with plenty of extra features, showcasing the movie-making processes, special effects secrets and deleted scenes etc.  All 3 films are encoded with DTS-HD audio which brings the action sequences to life with booming bass.

Amongst the 3 films, my favourite is Tomb of the Dragon Emperor.  Probably because it was the latest in the franchise, the visuals and audio are the most pristine.  This movie also transplants the Mummy mythology into other civilizations (in this case, terracotta warriors) and takes the audience out of Egypt for a refreshing change.  The Yeti monsters were very well done and animated; the avalanche scenes were breathtaking; the Dragon Emperor was probably more fearsome than Imhotep had ever been.

I highly recommend this blu-ray boxset to HD movie buffs.  Although the franchise is very heavy on CGI (not surprising, being Stephen Sommers films), each film offers 2 hours' money worth of entertainment for the action-adventure fan.  Until Universal Pictures makes the 4th film, this boxset offers the best collection of Mummy adventures money can buy,",1328227200,4,1653,5.239543726235741

3597025,5,B001G619C0,"This set appears to have been intended for sale in Europe - one of the ratings labels on the cover appears to be for the Irish Film Censor's Office. Being that I live in the US and was aware of the regional coding issues present with a lot of DVDs, I was a little nervous about buying this. I read up online about region coding on Blu-Rays and apparently it's used a lot less than in the DVD era and one source indicated that Universal doesn't region code their Blu-Rays at all.

I decided to try this set out due to the price difference between this version and the US labeled one. I use a PS3 for a Blu-Ray player and the discs work perfectly. I have a TON of language choices - I'll only use one, but that may be helpful to others out there. Other than that, absolutely no difference as far as the movie content and special features.

3597030,5,B001G619C0,"I have the Mummy (original) in VHS since in the 90's I forgot, but I enjoyed the first and second series of the Mummy but they ruined the 3rd Mummy with having ""Maria Bello""
as Evy O'Connell.

-First of all without the original Rachel Weisz, you know that the Mummy Series has died (if you watched the BEST 2 original prior and fan of that).
-Second, Maria did some ok acting (in the first scene where she sits with Brandon was really awkward)its like Rick had divorced Evy and married a ""uptight rick snob"" Evy
but I'm sorry she ruined it for me.
-Third, Why does happen in China? I mean the Mummy setting is usually somewhere in North Africa or Middle East (I hoped it was in the third one not the Far East)
-Fourth, Brendan Fraser and John Hannah was the best actor and continuing actors in the Mummy Series (I excluded Rachel Weisz just because she didn't sign on for the third one)
-Fifth, The Emperor is not a Mummy, he's a Mud Soldier (Terra Cotta) so its not the Mummy unless Imhotep stops by and controls the Emperor's Soldier (haha yeah right)
-Sixth, I forgot to mention more actors in the first Mummy, Kevin James O'Connor (Beni) and Omid Djalili (fat Warden) was the most funniest people I ever heard and seen in the Mummy

But enough complains about the Mummy 3

Universal successfully resuscitated it's venerable monster genre and transformed it into bigtime Tentpole event movies and produced two very good action adventure rides to take with the kids. III - Phoned in.  Brendan collects huge paycheck and goes home. Rachel wisely stays away in the first place.  Kid being groomed to carry on - the poor man's Shia (and I didn't think much of him either).  Jet Li - stony and morose.  Story is flat.  Use of China as a backdrop - secondary and poorly executed (nothing new or breathtaking here). This truly is the sin - we're actually IN China for heaven's sake and there is no grand vista, no expansive shots to dazzle us with the landscape.  In watching the nightclub scenes I kept expecting Kate Capshaw to step out and start singing - it's that derivative. Everything else is CGI.  No overall quality to raise it to the level of the other two.  But the kids will like the ride none-the-less...and yet...Worth the upgrade?  YES - for the first two alone.",1231113600,103,1116,4.715025906735751
