1817795,5,B00007KK20,"The thrill of watching international movies is to find a superb current release at your local first-run 'art house' cinema, lock on to a great star, then work backwards through that person's previous work.  ""Late Marriage"" is the perfect example of how that movie-watching technique can unearth a hidden gem.

In this case, you can start with the oustanding Israeli film (in theaters now), ""Walk on Water.""  You'll never see a better film. Its star, Lior Ashkenazi, is the hottest thing in Israel at the moment. His breakout, it turns out, was 2001's ""Late Marriage.""  Shockingly, my local rental location (with its 150 - 200 international titles) had it in stock.

There's an unexpected treat in here: 'Marriage' also features (albeit too briefly) the charms of Aya Koren (billed here as Aya Steinovitz).  This is the most beautiful woman in film today.  See 'Bonjour Monsieur Shlomi' if you doubt that.

The film itself is very enlightening and, ultimately, heartbreaking. It centers on the struggles of a 31-year-old man looking for independence in life and love, yet hampered by the expectations and, subsequently, outright threats of his family when it comes to the matters of marriage.  The ending of the film is a jawdropper.  You'd never get this type of dispiriting - but hyper-realistic - conclusion in the ""come lift us up where we belong"" world of Hollywood.

Speaking of which, there are some annoying things to comment on about the marketing of this movie.  A prominent blurb on the DVD cover box compares ""Marriage"" to ""Big, Fat Greek Wedding.""

Not on your life.  Writer/Director Dover Koshashvili must have spit out his breakfast when he read that.  These two films couldn't be more dissimilar in the way their respective culture conflicts get resolved.

Next, we had back of the DVD, which features solely a picture of Ashkenazi and Ms. Koren.  You can't fault a marketer for featuring her front and center, but, alas, she's not center to the film in any fashion.

Last, and most egregiously, when have the cover shot of Ashkenazi flashing his newly be-ringed finger into the mirror.  He appears to be showing it to co-star Ronit Elkabetz (his beloved Judith).  This photo is faked.  It's a montage.  It egregiously misrepresents the resolution of the movie.  At this point, Ashkenazi's Lior is alone, lost in deep introspection (we see why in the dramatic, concluding 10 minutes that follow).

Who is responsible for this trickery?  Why resort to it?  Will it sell a single extra copy of the movie?  I'll bet this approach greatly upset Mr. Koshashvili.  No way a director would condone this misrepresentation of his baby.",1112572800,26,2641,4.954441913439635
1817796,4,B00007KK20,"It's a movie, but you feel like rather than a script, you are seeing real life. Not a hollywood film where love triumphs and you get what you expect where the Hero gets the gril. Nothing is black and white.. Everyone wins, everyone loses.

1817798,5,B00007KK20,"By far the best Israeli movie I've seen, Late Marriage explores the  difficulties one 30-something intellectual has in individuating from his tradition-bound Georgian (as in former Soviet Union) family, who are recent immigrants to Israel. The movie, which is in Hebrew and Georgian, presents a much subtler and more convincing portrayal of the conflict between tradition and westernization, and of the more specific issue of arranged marriages, than the very popular ""Monsoon Wedding."" Unlike ""Monsoon Wedding,"" this is primarily a dark film with a powerful evocation of the grip of a reactionary family on an attractive and ostensibly mature man.
The performances are uniformly terrific and there is a prolonged  and explicit sex scene in the middle of the movie that is astonishing in its beauty and realism. The direction is unobtrusive and superb, with minimal camera movement and extremely long takes. Overall, ""Late Marriage"" doesn't really resemble most Israeli movies that I've seen - there's no reference whatsoever to the political situation, for example - and most closely resembles a quiet European art film from the 60s or 70s.
A must-have for collectors of serious cinema for grown-ups.",1067904000,15,1201,5.349206349206349

1817800,5,B00007KK20,"First of all, Bret Fetzer's review ...pretty well sums up my feelings about the movie. There's little I can add, except to ask, why don't American audiences appreciate sensitive films like ""Late Marriage?"" Are we so addicted to mindless fluff, senseless and gratuitous violence, and  endless chase scenes that we can't appreciate stories that are true-to-life with characters involved in ordinary conflicts whose growth is revealed through literate dialogue? The answer, I believe, is obvious, based upon the popularity of TV ""reality"" shows. Reality??? I think not. ""Late Marriage,"" however, IS reality. And, like real life, it doesn't offer us a tidy plot or satisfactory ending. Rather, the ending is open-ended, leaving us to wonder what will this marriage be like? Did Zaza really come to his senses, as his family believes, or will his marriage mirror those of his parents and other relatives? Is there happiness in his future, or will he go numbly through life making choices that meet with his family's approval? Frankly, I wanted a happy, ""and they lived happily ever after"" ending, but I'm grateful ""Late Marriage"" didn't go there. I would have felt short-changed, like I do after so many American films. PS. Yes, the sex scene is prolonged and erotic and very beautiful in its own way. If only American film makers would handle sex and sexuality with such grace. Wonderful film!",1045958400,10,1389,5.065502183406114

1817832,5,B00007KK20,"Super.

We have a young man enveloped, through his family, in a powerful, overweening culture whose very existence seems to depend upon obedience to its rules and values. His family is a tool by which this culture sets the boundaries on his life. His choice of whom to love is denied by this family through the application of both guilt and force.
While he attempts rebellion, he - as well as does the woman he would love - they ultimately are bullied into submitting to the forces which would tear them apart.
In the last series of scenes - at the wedding arranged for him - he rages obliquely against his fate in ways that only we the viewers can really appreciate.
Yes, there is a whiff of Romeo and Juliet,but it is not ham fisted.

His parents, Georgian immigrants, are anxious for him to get married within the Georgian community in Israel.  However, he is not interested because he has a girlfriend, a divorcee with a child, whom he is partially supporting --with the unwitting help of his parents.  Because of his dependence on and respect for his parents, he is unable to oppose them when they insist that he drop the girlfriend.

1817953,5,B00007KK20,"I remember when I first saw `Late Marriage' (which wasn't all that long ago, to be quite honest).  It have me chills.  I literally had goosebumps running down my arms.  The reason is not the message or the story in itself but more the brutally honest way that it is told.  There is something so organic about this film; so lived in and real and emotionally consuming.  Every moment feels like a home reel, and that is almost unprecedented today.  That isn't to say that there is a cheapness about the film, for it never once feels poorly conceived or shot, but the scenes are allowed to linger long enough for them to feel truly lived in.  They feel authentic.  The script is written in such a way that it allows the actors to delve inside these characters and express themselves with an authenticity that is demanded with a theme so complicated.

And complicated it is.

The film is basically two parts.  One is a modern take on a love story.  You have a single man entering his thirties who is in love with a divorced woman slightly his elder who has a daughter of her own.  On the outset this wouldn't seem so `odd', but when you factor in the deeply rooted religious feelings of this man's family then you have an affair that carries itself in secret while this young man, Zaza, weighs out the consequences of establishing his relationship with this woman, Judith, any deeper.  He wants to make her his wife, but that would result in turmoil.  His family is insistent that he wed, but a young girl (untouched), and his marriage to a divorced woman would bring shame on him and his family.  That is where the second part comes into play.  When you get passed the love story you come to a familial story of loyalty and honor; of tradition and expectations.  The relationship between Zaza and his parents is an interesting one that is easily dismissed as unhealthy and unrealistic by those who don't `understand' where they are coming from, but viewing this film with an open mind (and heart) will allow you to appreciate that it is abnormally normal in the light in which it is developed.

When those two parts collide, `Late Marriage' becomes genius.

The performances here are wonderfully complex and beautifully fleshed out by the entire cast.  Lior Ashkenazi transcends mere acting here.  He becomes Zaza and breaks down the core of the man.  He is so natural in every scene, regardless of what he's expected to do (be a son, be a father, be a lover, be a man) that he instantly becomes not only relatable, but unforgettable.  Matching him almost every step of the way is the beautiful Ronit Elkabetz.  There is such an honest connection between these two actors.  While she doesn't have as full a character arc as Lior (Zaza is undeniably the central character, and his emotions come full circle by the film's end), she manages to make every moment feel real.  The honesty that bleeds from their love scene alone is simply unmatchable.

They complete one another.

`Late Marriage' has equal parts respect and distain for its central characters, making this one of the more honest cinematic highlights of the past decade.  It's awkward and unnerving and surprisingly complex.  It approaches the idea of love and honor from a place that most films won't go.  It has wit and charm, but in the end it is a sobering reminder that life, love and family can be crushingly complicated.",1317254400,4,3384,4.635294117647059
1817954,5,B00007KK20,"Late Marriage is a 2001 Israeli film written and directed by Dover Kosashvili with an excellent cast led by the engaging Lior Ashkenazi(Walk On Water, etc) as Zaza, a 30-something Israeli bachelor who is dating a divorcee with a child. He is badgered by his family to get married and in their desperation they make a concerted effort to arrange meetings with prospective brides and even spy on him and his girlfriend. The scene in the parking lot is funny, while the following confrontation is intense!

The way they staked out the girl friend's apartment, rifled it with many humiliating remarks, & threatened her - with total indifference to her little girl's presence - was a great depiction of cruel, cold self righteous indignation.

I found it concerning that the boyfriend liked to lie on the floor and extend his arms up in the air for the little girl to try to balance herself on his hands - all with her wearing a short skirt.  Even more concerning was the bizarre scence in the bathroom with his father where the man is on his knees pressing his face into his father's crotch & making pretty strange remarks.

This has been my approach this last month or so but as the days get shorter I anticipate that I will have opportunity to curl up on the couch this winter and loose myself for a couple of hours experiencing it with hindsight, knowing what to look for the next time and expecting to find some surprises.  It does not appear to be really complicated.  It actually moves pretty quickly from the untenable situation in the beginning through what I, with my western background, feel was an improbable development to a stark conclusion.  It does not begin well.  It does not end well.  It was messy all the way through.  I don't see that the experience would raise anybody's spirits.  I do not see that we're selling any moral values.  I do not see that we're decrying immorality.  If anything perhaps what we have here is a dramatization of just how messed up everything can get so that we can be inspired to try real hard to do better, ourselves, just anywhere and everywhere along the line.  A simple love tragedy grown out of a triumph for old-world family values.",1255219200,,1227,4.4774774774774775
1817958,4,B00007KK20,"""Late Marriage"" is a Hebrew-language movie directed and written by Dover Kosashvilli. It focuses on Georgian Jewish immigrants in Israel who are still bound by old world traditions and where the young  generation is still very much at the mercy of the older generation, especially in matters pertaining to marriage. Zaza [ Lior Ashkenazi] is a 31-year-old graduate student working towards his doctorate in philosophy. His parents are eager to see him married and worried that he will choose an unsuitable bride. So Zaza reluctantly goes along with their matchmaking efforts, whilst concealing the fact that he is in fact involved in a long-term affair with a divorced, single mom Judith [Ronit Elkabetz].

Soon enough, things reach crisis point when his parents find out about Judith and rope in their close relatives to help them intervene and put a stop to the affair. The scene where they confront Judith is remarkable in revealing the true nature of some of the main characters. Ultimately, the question is: will Zaza stand up for his rights and protect the woman he truly loves, or will he meekly adhere to his parents' wishes?

The acting was excellent all-round and truly portrayed how some traditional societies are still deeply mired in cultural practices that can be deemed rather out of date by contemporary standards. I could empathize with the situation because I myself had to endure similar intrusions in my personal life by 'well-meaning' relatives before ultimately marrying a man of my own choice. This story may seem a bit shocking to those who haven't experienced such heavy-handed interference in their lives, but I have to say that such things as matchmaking, and arranged marriages are not uncommon in very traditional societies [not just confined to Georgian Jews, but others such as conservative Indians etc]. For some such arranged marriages actually work out well, but many others still prefer to choose their own life partners.

The actor portraying Zaza [Lior Ashkenazi] is convincing in his role as the amorous yet weak-willed lover, and Ronit Elkabetz is amazing as the much maligned Judith who displays remarkable courage and conviction towards the end. The chemistry between the two leads are credible and the sex scenes are quite graphic [both male and female nudity are portrayed] but I guess these scenes sort of serve to establish the immense sexual connection between the pair, though some parts just felt rather overdone to me.

All in all, I felt this was a rather refreshing movie with its less commonly explored theme of arranged marriage, and it provides remarkable insights into a culture I was previously unfamiliar with.",1243036800,3,2666,5.091533180778032
1817959,1,B00007KK20,"Apparently, the other reviewers saw a different film, because the one I watched was awful.  The only remotely likeable character in the whole movie was the little girl.  I've never been to Israel, so I can't comment on what life is like there, but I really don't believe that the losers in this film portray the typical Israeli.  Basically, the film is about hypocritical old men, stupid women, and the biggest Mama's Boy of all time.",1227830400,,434,4.684210526315789
1817970,3,B00007KK20,Something may have been lost in translation of this unfunny comedy. (Perhaps the Hebrew version is a hoot). I'm giving it 3 stars because it is of some cultural interest about the Georgian community.,1221264000,,199,4.882352941176471
1817971,2,B00007KK20,"""Late Marriage"" was a frustrating film for me to watch, at least the last half.  I admit that it is probably true to its culture.  My lack of enjoyment is based on our culture here in the USA; yet I found it impossible to separate.  The first half is interesting with the family taking Zaza played by Lior Louie Ashkenazi to meet girls to marry.  At 31, they are worried that he will remain a bachelor.  Zaza is a graduate student in philosophy working on his doctorate.  Other than a brief reference, his studies never seem to impact the film, other than to explain why @ 31 he still has his parents' credit card.  Ronit Elkabetz plays the Moroccan immigrant Judith who is divorced.  Zaza and she have a torrid relationship in a graphic bedroom scene.  However, Judith does not want to introduce Zaza to her daughter Madonna.  Zaza knows that his family would never accept Judith because she is divorced.  Lili Kosashvili who is the real-life mother of director Dover Kosashvili plays the character Lili in the film.  Her character is the real heavy in the film.  She transforms a romantic comedy into a social tragedy as Zaza fails to stand up for the woman he loves.  Moni Moshonov plays Zaza's father Yasha with appropriate amounts of vacillation.  A similar history between the parents may explain what seems like an over-reaction by the parents.  The scene where the parents break into Judith's apartment and hurl insults on her and even put a sword to her throat in front of her little daughter Madonna played by Sapir Kugman is unforgivable.  I was enjoying this movie and came to truly hate it.  The performances and direction work; but it is the story to which I was unable to relate.  Taxi!",1220400000,8,1701,4.62876254180602
1817972,4,B00007KK20,"This film should be mandatory for watching by any student of anthropology, or women studies.  Although it is made in Israel, it is unique to certain parts of the world where partiarchal society is still having stronghold.  Main character, a single man of 31 is being forced by his parents to find a wife and marry.  What they do not know is that he has an affair with a woman who is: a) older than him, b) she is divorced and c) has a child from previous relationship.  Can this tripple whammy go against both of them and the future of their relationship?  In a society where jobs are scarce, an adult man is treated as mama's boy and where his family secures their unemployed son safely tucked in a graduate school at age 31: an apartment with furniture and necessary utilities such as TV, credit card with unlimited credit disposal, etc. - can this man make a decision on who will share his life with?  There are no winners or loosers here.  This film will keep you thinking long after you are done watching it.

1817973,3,B00007KK20,"One might have thought that arranged marriages are a thing of the past among Israeli Jews. But according to this bittersweet comedy, the tradition is alive and well, at least among the conservative Georgian Jewish community in Israel the movie is set on (director Kashashivili belongs to that community). The protagonist of the movie is Zaza, an unmarried man in his early thirties and graduate student in philosophy (played by the fine actor Lior Ashkenazi, who starred as the brutal Mossad agent in another great Israeli movie, Walk on Water). His concerned family shows him young, attractive, and eligible girls, but he resists them all - since he already has a secret love affair with Judith, a sexually liberated mother and divorce. Zaza knows his extended family would never accept Judith; but when they find out, the results are worse than you can imagine. Let just say, quoting one critic, that joining the Foreign Legion is probably preferable than living with such family. The ending is quite sad, but this is a remarkable film.",1175990400,7,1038,4.971264367816092

1817975,5,B00007KK20,"One aspect of this excellent movie that hasn't really been mentioned here is the fact that Zaza's mother and father did in fact indicate to each other that they would accept Judith if they had to, without carrying out their threats to cut off their son.  Zaza may love Judith, but he turns out to be the weak, dependent boy his parents think him to be, and he won't make a stand for the woman he loves.  For all their name-calling and superior attitude toward Judith, she turns out to be too good for Zaza and his family.  The movie doesn't have a sad ending if you see it in terms of Zaza getting what he really deserved and was capable of handling, and Judith remaining free to find a stronger and better man.  She dodged a bullet!",1134432000,21,733,4.2898550724637685

WRONG! That opener is the reason I chose ""Late Marriage"", but boy is that ever misleading; who writes those little synopses, anyway? Is there no accountability?

Instead, this movie ""treats"" us to an unbelievably demanding and overbearing family, and the 31 year old son who tolerates their abuse. This family's behavior just stretched the limits of credulity WAY beyond acceptable boundaries. Yeah, I know it's just a movie, and one has to take these things with a grain of salt, but this one requires about ten oceans worth.

Oh, and that's not to mention the abrupt and inexplicable ending. A total letdown.

1817978,5,B00007KK20,"This story concerns a young man's struggles with his ultra-traditional family which has immigrated to Israel from Georgia. (That's the former soviet republic, NOT the U.S. state!)

A handsome intellectual, he is still unmarried at 31, which is a scandal for his conservative family.  He cannot tell them that he is in love with a woman they would never approve of -- a divorced woman with a child -- so he lets his parents drag him around to meet prospective wives and their families.  These scenes are painfully awkward and funny, almost seeming to be exaggerated to anyone who is not familiar with families like his.

His relationship with the woman he loves is depicted in startlingly explicit detail, by North American standards.  I found it refreshing, when many Hollywood actors refuse to do nude scenes after they've ""made it"", to see Lior Ashkenazi, a major star in Israel, sharing himself so generously with his audience that, after all, pays his salary -- instead of merely with the current ""Starlet of the Month"", or in the usual serial matrimony.

You may not like the ending, but this isn't phoney-happy Hollywood. The version I have is in Georgian and Hebrew, but other versions exist that have been dubbed into English or French.",1119657600,2,1244,4.872037914691943
