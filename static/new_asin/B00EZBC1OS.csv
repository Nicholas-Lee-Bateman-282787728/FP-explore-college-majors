8610772,5,B00EZBC1OS,"Ray Cannata is a witness for Jesus Christ's work to heal New Orleans.  This movie uses the lens of great New Orleans food and all the traditions and communities that go along with it to take on the misconceptions and prejudices about New Orleans and its people, which exist across America.  Perceived vices become virtues in Ray's tale of redemption and reconciliation for a beautiful, broken city.  After the brokenness was laid bare by Hurricane Katrina, God is healing the city through great food and great music shared by people who love their neighbors, their neighborhood, and the culture of New Orleans. If you love New Orleans, this movie will warm your soul and should be watched with a sazerac.  If you don't understand how anyone could love New Orleans, watch this movie and learn to see the city the way God sees it.",1388016000,4,828,4.729166666666667
8610773,5,B00EZBC1OS,"I thought this movie was great.  I went in expecting a lot more talk about the food styles of New Orleans, but that's not what it is.  Any review will tell you that the movie utilizes the concept of virtues and vices to talk about New Orleans on larger scale, and concentrates on the concept of virtue as exemplified in and at different restaurants.  If you've been in or heard of even one of those spotlighted restaurants, then you'll enjoy the memory of your own experience and what was more than just the food that left those memories.  But I found that the movie provided a real spotlight on the personalities of New Orleans also, and at this time those personalities are not only those present for generations but also those who have been here only a few years.  The restaurants and foods of New Orleans bring all of those personalities together, sometimes in one location or sometimes just down the street from each other.  While there is no doubt that this movie shines the brightest on New Orleans and its diverse culture of both food and people, it shines broader that no matter where you are there is always great virtue to be found when you share time together (even if your mouth is full).",1380844800,4,1201,4.537037037037037
8610774,5,B00EZBC1OS,"Ray Cannata is not only the pastor of Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New Orleans, but is also known as The Man Who Ate New Orleans. He is so called because of his successful quest to eat at every (non-chain) restaurant in New Orleans. That quest was part of a larger story though, a story told in Michael Dunaway's documentary film of the same name.

It's not just a story about food though. It's a story of one man's love for the city to which God had called him. Ray likes to say, ""New Orleans is the best picture of Heaven that I know on earth.  It's also the best picture of Hell I know.""  This balance, he says, provides both something to look forward to, as well as something to be a part of fixing. Ray and Redeemer have been a big part of that effort ever since Hurricane Katrina, and The Man Who Ate New Orleans does a great job of telling that story.",1379548800,4,861,4.206060606060606
8610775,5,B00EZBC1OS,"As a hungry woman and author of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cats-Boys-and-Booze-Or-How-NOT-to-Find-Love-in-a-Really-Small-Town/dp/B008RSGKBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cats, Boys and Booze; Or, How NOT to Find Love in a Really Small Town</a>, I get it. The town needs you, and you need the town, whether you know it or not. And whether it's by liquor (and various other bad decisions, in my case) or food (in Ray Cannata's case), amazing things happen on the journey of neighborly love and self-discovery. I was overwhelmed with love and pride in my nation when I saw this film. This documentary was so... to use an overused word but an apt description nonetheless... COOL! Michael Dunaway's film was so creative, so inspiring, and so friggin' delicious all at once. Who the hell needs reality TV when there's food for the mind right here, quite literally. An excellent film that reminds us who we all are: struggling, searching, neighborly, American, and hungry. Brilliant.",1379376000,3,1021,5.8133333333333335
8610776,5,B00EZBC1OS,"This documentary exemplifies what I truly love about New Orleans. So much more than what you have seen on TV. A place that accepts you where you are, celebrates despite what your circumstances are. New Orleans, a true picture of heaven and hell on earth.  Ray Cannata, a true New Orleanian.",1379289600,2,290,4.686274509803922
8610777,5,B00EZBC1OS,"There are so many ideas and stereotypes about New Orleans. Having never been myself, I have only these stereotypes and other anecdotes to tell me about the place. The Man Who Ate New Orleans allowed me to look past my preconceptions about the city and see it through the eyes of a pastor who loves God, people, and his city New Orleans. It was such an inspiration to know that in the darkest of places there are those acting as a light of hope. Ray's church has rebuilt over 500 homes since Katrina. To eat in every area of New Orleans and to build homes for its inhabitants is such a testament to God's love and Ray's love and dedication.

The movie follows Ray Cannata through the end of his journey to eat at every locally-owned restaurant in New Orleans. The film's structure follows that of the seven cardinal virtues of New Orleans. Each virtue of the city is represented by a restaurant, its proprietors, and its patrons. In total, I feel like I can see the city, taste the foods, and know the heart of Ray for this city and its people.

I would highly recommend this movie!",1379203200,2,1081,4.42713567839196
8610778,5,B00EZBC1OS,"Being a New Orleanian (not by birth, unfortunately), I know how great this city can be. From the food to the people, NOLA is the most unique and wonderful place I know. So I went into this movie expecting a great look into both the food and people of New Orleans... and I got exactly that.

This movie is a great picture of everything I love about New Orleans: food, people, the resiliency of the city, religion, and of course, Ray Cannata. A fascinating look into his life and his astounding, contagious love for New Orleans.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.",1379116800,2,547,4.571428571428571
