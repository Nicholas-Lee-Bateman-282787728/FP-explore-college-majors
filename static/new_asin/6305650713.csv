1054845,5,6305650713,"I really enjoy this video because I can do whichever workouts I'm in the mood for. I usually do the fast paced workouts in one day, and the yoga, pilates and ballet another day, or I'll do ALL of them one day. I like it because I get bored really easy, so once I'm tired of boot camp, I can cool down with pilates and then beef it up again with Kickboxing!",998352000,8,356,3.9583333333333335
1054846,5,6305650713,"This is a tape you won't tire of because it has five, 10-minute sections.  Each can be done in conjunction with other types of exercise--or done all at once.  Boot camp combines aerobics and weights--additional weight work, on your own, would be needed.  Rock-Hard Abs uses mat work from the Pilates regimen,(You may need to support your head with your arms, to avoid neck strain.) Ballet has an excellent workout for the legs, buttocks, and Kickboxing does a short routine using basic punches and kicks.  Finally, if you want a good stretching routine, the tape has a Yoga section.  All sections are very basic, simple and yet, you'll see, feel, results.",981417600,12,655,4.864864864864865
1054847,4,6305650713,This video is a great video if you are a fast learner.  The woman goes very fast and doesnt really explain things.  And shes a bit stuck up.  But it gives you a great workout in 10minutes and the yoga is great i use it everyday!,981244800,,228,3.9130434782608696
1054848,4,6305650713,"This tape is great for people who lack the time and motivation to exercise. The short length is great for me...I do the tape in the morning  before work and can't use the excuse that exercising will make me  late.
The variety really keeps me interested and the segments seem more  like play than exercise. I especially like the instructor...she's more real  and clear that most instructors on other tapes I own and have abandoned.  For anyone who thinks the segments are too short, try doing two in a row. I  agree that the pace is quick...no time to sit back or take a sip of water.  Unfortunately, the studio is very spartan...no Death Valley or island shots  here.
On the whole, this is a great tape to use when 10 minutes of  exercise is all you can (or want to) spare.",967334400,6,773,4.387323943661972
1054849,2,6305650713,"I really am not a fan of this video.  The exercises are not in a very logical order and not long enough to really get much out of.  Also, if you find that you only like a few of them, you constantly have to fast forward  to get to the ones you like.  And, to be honest, I just found it to be  pretty boring.",964396800,7,307,3.6615384615384614
1054850,3,6305650713,"I bought this video for the varied workout styles and the time saving element. It definately does have great variety and you do feel that you are getting a good workout in the short bursts of time. I tend to combine two  or three of the sections, starting out slow and building. But this video is  not for beginners. This is a fast-paced video. The instructor goes over the  move and then bam, she's into it. I've been working out for a while and I  find it hard to keep up. I guess when you only have ten minutes you need to  keep it moving along, but I feel that this  video is for people who are  already working out and are a quick study.",962150400,13,642,4.088
1054851,3,6305650713,"Compared to The Firm's Fat Blaster and other cardio and fatburning workouts I think this workout is a little dissapointing. I didlike the idea of including a little of everything, yoga, Palates etc. but you tend to lose the intensity of a real ""cardio"" workout. I will use this video in conjunction with more intense workouts. It makes a nice change of pace but don't expect a heavy duty blow out class. Would be useful to use as a ""light day"" workout or to lengthen tight muscles.  END",950486400,7,486,4.5227272727272725
1054902,5,6305650713,"About 6 months ago I decided it was time to make a healthier life style, I began eating better and working out.  I have since lost about 45 pounds and over 20 inches. But I wanted to add just a little more. I got this DVD because I am not a morning person, and I figured if I could wake up ten minutes earlier and do this plus my evening workouts it would really jump start things. It ended up sitting on my shelf for a few months....lesson learned...not a morning person. But I decided to start throwing this dvd in after my gym workout.....and I LOVED IT! It is a nice addition to my daily routine, and has helped me get out of the rut. The instructor is great, not annoying at all. The workouts are easy to follow, but you still feel the benefits. I would highly recommend this dvd to someone who is looking to either add to their workout or beginning to add fitness to their life. I just ordered 3 more 10 minute solution dvd's to keep my body guessing and I can't wait for them to arrive!",1261958400,,993,4.1450777202072535
1054903,4,6305650713,"I ordered this video because I wanted a little taste of ballet and of kickboxing without having to buy a video of either of them.  I love 10 Minute Solution's format, so this was perfect.  The video suits my purpose exactly.
The boot camp section is not a challenge at all, especially compared to some of the other videos I have, but it does get you warmed up for the rest of the video.  The second section, the abs (Pilates) section, is still a challenge for me - mostly just for endurance.  I can do all the exercises, just not without resting between them.  The third section is the ballet.  I'm glad I ordered this video instead of a ballet video.  I can handle 10 minutes of ballet, but the truth is, I don't like it as much as I thought I would.  My favorite section is the 4th one, the kickboxing.  Here again, I wouldn't want a whole video of it, but 10 minutes is really fun.
The last section is yoga, but it's only a sample of relaxing or stretching yoga.  It's great for a wind-down from the rest of the video, but if you're looking for a good yoga workout, get either of 10 Minute Solution's yoga videos.
Overall, I like the video because it's a great variety.",1255564800,,1172,4.262443438914027
1054904,4,6305650713,"I was very pleased with how quickly it was delivered. That doesn't always happen as we live in AK. I realized after receiving that it wasn't a DVD, however, that was my mistake for overlooking that it had been indicated it was a VHS format. I still can use it though.

1054905,4,6305650713,"Good basic video that gives you an introduction to other types of fitness. The yoga 10-minute section really isn't a workout - it's just stretching. Abs are great for days when your workout doesn't use your core. The sides of my legs usually ache the day after the ballet workout. Kickbox and boot camp are too short for any real cardio benefits, but add to another video and you have a full workout. I really like Michell Dozois and have purchased some of her other videos after this. She's motivating without being fake cheerful.",1235347200,,531,4.659574468085107
1054906,1,6305650713,"I can't say that this is one of my favorite workout videos. I got bored with the workouts.  You sweat some after doing the the bootcamp and kickboxing segments together, but the camera angles are not the best. Also, if you find that you only like a few of them, you constantly have to fast forward to get to the ones you like. To be honest, I just found it to be pretty boring.  I like more of an intense workout.",1215475200,,413,4.08641975308642

1054908,5,6305650713,"This is one of my favorite workout videos -- I destroyed my VCR tape with too many replays, and now I have the DVD which is far better with the programming aspect (select multiple workouts to play in sequence).  I would really recommend this DVD, particularly for someone who is just starting out with a regular fitness routine.  I read some other reviews that criticize the short duration of the cardio workouts, but when I was just starting to exercise, they were challenging enough and a good way to learn what I liked (kickboxing) and didn't like (the ""boot campy"" stuff).  Even though I've now graduated to longer and more advanced exercise programs, I still frequently use the awesome 10 minute pilates segment on this recording as a coda for my other, more cardio-based workouts.  The ballet and yoga segments are both great for relaxing and easing stress in the evenings.  Above all, the instructor is fantastic.  Her instructions are clear enough that you can get by the first time and feel really comfortable after only a few viewings, and she doesn't feel the need to chit-chat constantly through the whole tape.",1199404800,,1123,4.822916666666667
1054909,4,6305650713,"After doing tae kwon do for quite a while, I took a break, and was completely out of shape. I got this DVD and a few other 10-Minute titles to help me start transitioning back into a fitness lifestyle.

Overall, I really like the customizable features, allowing me to tailor a 10- to 50-minute workout, using any of the routines I wanted. I like all the routines, and found them all interesting and challenging enough to make me start sweating by the end. The only one that holds less appeal for me is the kick-boxing. I don't know if it's this routine or kick-boxing in general, but after learning form and control from my martial arts training, I have a hard time going fast and loose the way the instructor does--it feels more like a dance. Still decent cardio, if short, but I definitely won't give up my time with the heavy bag to maintain a fighting form.

I think this DVD is excellent for those wishing to resume or begin an active lifestyle, as you can create a workout as long and varied or as short and focused as you like.",1182470400,2,1034,4.380208333333333
1054910,2,6305650713,"I love to use the 10-Minute Solutions workouts to obtain a variety in my exercise.  I wouldn't recommend this one.  The workouts are not well planned out and at times the instructor rushes through an exercise.  Compared to the other 10-Minute Solutions workouts, this one is below par.",1181865600,,285,4.895833333333333
1054911,1,6305650713,this video made me feel stupid.. she was too quick and the steps are hard to do on carpet.  I hope to get better but I am not happy with it yet..,1179964800,3,145,3.53125
1054951,5,6305650713,"I love the entire 10 minute serie. I enjoy this one especially, because I can have fun with little work out from different source. ballet! That's fun. boot camp. I need that! kickboxing. Great! Yoga. never done that before.

I can customise my work out and change every day my routine.",1174262400,2,285,4.588235294117647
1054952,5,6305650713,"I like the variety of the routines (both within each segment, and also between the different workouts).

 I like how the instructor and the music is high energy and motivating.  The instructor has good form and is able to do even the more challenging moves with good control.  She also reminds you to do the motions with good form (e.g. squeeze your abs).

Before I tried the video, I was skeptical about whether a 10 minute routine would really be a ""workout,"" because most other videos I have tried are still doing slow stretches after 10 minutes.  To my surprise, I found that doing even just one 10 minute segment was making me sweat.  I think the key to this is the instructor keeps moving so that there isn't wasted time spent on talking or waiting around.  She keeps the routine flowing from one movement to the next, so she was able to cram in a suprising number of exercises before the 10minutes were up.

For those of you who like to focus on body parts, I would say that the primary areas targeted in each section are boot camp=cardio, pilates=abs, ballet=legs/thighs, kickboxking=arms+cardio, and yoga=stretching.",1160524800,2,1125,4.728205128205128
1054953,5,6305650713,"I had this vhs years ago and was thrilled to find it again on dvd.  I especially like the dvd because you can customize your workout.  I have since bought all the 10 minute solution dvds but this one remains my favorite.

I like this instructor a lot.  She cues well and is understanding of modifications.

My only complaint is a small one.  On the ballet section, which is my favorite, I wish they had used ballet music instead of the techno-beat music they used.  It distracts from the ballet workout.  Other than that, excellent dvd!",1146268800,2,536,4.510416666666667
1054954,5,6305650713,"I'm in my 50's.  My neighbor is in her 60's and has had a knee replacement and achilles tendon surgery.  We do a quick 10 minutes of this DVD in the early morning before our half hour walk.  True there are parts that she can't get her leg to do, and we both get confused occasionally... but we're getting better the more we do it and enjoy the variety.  No one is looking at us, so what difference does it matter that two out of shape grandmas are messing up a bit?  Whats important is that in the 3 months we've been doing it, my neighbor has dropped a pant size and I've lost 7 pounds.

What is perfect is that each segment has stretching for her leg both before and after the excercises.  She usually does a few extra stretches before I come over and after I leave for work, and this dvd has given more ideas than her therapist.",1143763200,5,831,4.124223602484472
1054955,2,6305650713,"If you like 10 Minute Solution, I would recommend the cardio, kickboxing or sculpt DVDs where you can do all five of them and have a real workout.  In my case, I have an unpredictable 1 and a half year old at home so I sometimes don't know how long I'll be able to exercise before she has a major infantile meltdown.  So sometimes, I do 20, sometimes 30.  If she's in a good mood, I can get in the whole thing.  What I don't like about this tape is it truly is designed for 10 minutes.  I don't think all five of the workouts do well together.  And I didn't find any of them very intense.",1141171200,11,588,3.982905982905983
1054956,2,6305650713,"In theory, this DVD provides a great mix of different workout styles: Boot Camp, Pilates, Ballet, Kickboxing, and Yoga. However, it just doesn't work. If you approach this DVD as an introduction to those styles of exercise, I fear will you will be turned off of all of them.

She goes too fast, and doesn't explain what you're supposed to be doing. You get better the more you do them ~ but that does not solve the problem of performing these movements safely. Form is hugely important when you're doing such things as complicated kicks, and if you're trying to do them as quickly as she is and without instruction, you're liable to do more harm than good.

If you already have a baseline knowledge of these types of workouts, this is a good way to get a few quickie sessions in. But if you're looking for instruction, look elsewhere.

For quick strength workouts, I highly recommend the 8 Minute Workouts, which are safe, effective, and not rushed like this DVD. For kickboxing, try Tae Bo ~ Bill Blanks does an incredible job with instruction, even though those workouts are fast-paced. Also his workouts are fun, unlike this DVD, which will leave you confused and/or frustrated.",1139356800,6,1181,4.723300970873787
1054957,4,6305650713,"I bought this because of the variety, and I tried each workout today for the first time. As everyone else stated, the instructor moves VERY quickly and she's hard to follow the first time around. This will obviously improve with more viewings. Boot camp was a bit difficult because I had trouble following all the jumping. However the workout was over in a flash, and I like when it seems like the time flies by. Pilates was quite difficult as I've only taken one pilates class before, but it makes for a good 10-min ab routine. I had never tried ballet, so I found this interesting and not incredibly difficult. I love kickboxing, so I enjoyed this quick but packed routine. Yoga was very relaxing and is a great cool down/stretch to any workout.

I did find the instructor a bit annoying at first but had no problems with her by the end. I might have just been annoyed that I couldn't follow her in boot camp :P Her cueing for the most part is pretty good, but her timing was a bit off in certain sections. If you want to try new workouts, this is perfect. I couldn't imagine only doing one 10-minute segment by itself as your entire workout for the day, but I think any of these workouts make a nice supplement to others and the mix-and-match feature is pretty cool. I am pleased with this purchase.",1126742400,2,1302,4.425
1054958,4,6305650713,"Other reviewers have done a good job highlighting the various aspects of this particular ""10-Minute Solution"" workout, so here's a quick breakdown:

GOOD:  This DVD contains a great ten-minute-each sampling of the most popular fitness methods:  Boot Camp, Ballet, Kickboxing, Pilates, and Yoga.  Therefore, you can try them out and see which ones you might want to add to your fitness routine.  If all the workouts are done in order, you'll get a solid strength, flexibility, and cardio workout in fifty minutes.  However, the menu allows you to choose which ones you want to do, and also place them in whatever order you want.  It's easy to mix and match them with your remote, even if you struggle with setting the clock on your DVD player.  You can create a shorter workout if pressed for time, or even a specialized workout routine. For example, mainly cardio=kickboxing and boot camp (with yoga as a cool down).  Mainly strength=pilates, ballet, and yoga.  As for the instructor, she has enthusiasm, good form, and most of the time calls well.

GOTCHAS:  There's a lot of exercise crammed into each ten-minute segment, and that affects the workouts in a couple of ways.  First, some of the stretches are over almost before you can get into them.  Second, the transitions can be jarring, especially when the instructor's cues are a bit off.  Finally, a beginner may be overwhelmed by the rapid pace of the workouts.  The boot camp and kickboxing segments are the most intense, so these issues are most noticeable in them.  The other workouts have a slower pace (especially yoga), but are still a bit speedier than a longer version would be.  As you gain fitness and become more familiar with this DVD, these issues should become less of a problem.

VERDICT: This is a good addition to any home workout video library.  So far I've been impressed with the ""10-Minute Solution"" line of workout DVDs.  Recommended.",1124841600,3,1914,4.863777089783282
1054959,4,6305650713,"I like quick workouts b/cause it allows me to do as short or as long of a workout as I want.  I like the variety of this dvd, it gives you some cardio as well as toning.  The instructor gets right into the moves & moves from each one quickly but effectively, and she doesnt pause in between each move to talk about the next move.  The different sections do move quick, but they do work.  If you combine bootcamp & kickboxing you can get a descent cardio workout.  Ballet & kickboxing do require more than 1 viewing to get the moves downpack (at least for someone w/little coordination).",1121299200,,586,4.339449541284404
1054960,4,6305650713,"I like this DVD because it gave me a chance to try out some of the newer, ""trendy"" exercises like Kickboxing and Pilates.  I found that I liked the kickboxing enough to buy Kathy Smith's Kickboxing DVD (which is longer and more intense).  It also showed the basic moves, so it was easy to catch on when I tried Kathy's more advanced DVD.

I also found that I liked the Pilates better than doing regular crunches.  The Ballet was simple and even fun to do.  It made me feel graceful and I felt it in my legs afterwards.  The Yoga segment is a good introduction for beginners.  It shows the basic moves you need to know before trying more advanced moves.  The boot camp is a good energizing workout.  It's high/low impact though; and since I live on the 2nd floor of an apartment, I don't use this one much.

Michelle is upbeat, friendly, and motivating.  She's the perfect workout instructor.

Each one is only 10 minutes and it's good for beginners or those who want to try some new exercises.  For the more advanced, it would make a good warm-up DVD before your regular exercise program.",1119657600,,1088,4.461928934010152
1055009,5,6305650713,I think this is a great tape for people who have no time at all. I just finshed the first segment(boot camp) and god am i sweating!!!

1055012,5,6305650713,"After reading other reviews, I actually feel pretty good about myself.  Everyone has said that the kick-boxing was too hard, but it is my absolute favorite.  It is tough the first 2 or 3 times, but once you get it down a little it is great.  I also like the boot camp and pilates sections, they work great.",1107302400,,306,4.241379310344827
1055013,3,6305650713,"One of my goals this month was to increase the duration of my toning/weight workouts (on the days in between cardio workouts).  I had been just doing a 15-minute abs, arms or buns segment from TamiLee Webb's ""I Want That Body!"" workout on most toning days and it wasn't enough.  Now, I do a 15-minute TamiLee segment PLUS one or two of the 10-minute solution workouts and it gives me a more varied (and less boring) workout that works more parts of my body and goes by very quickly!

Of the 5 workouts on the DVD, I was able to get through most of them on the first try.  Pilates was the hardest for me.  Then probably Boot Camp.  Kickboxing is tough but it's one of my favorites.  On first viewing, I thought the Ballet segment would be my least favorite, but I have come to really enjoy it--great workout for the legs/hips/behind!  I have always hated yoga (I have arthritis in my spine and a very inflexible body overall and yoga always made me feel like an invalid), but this is a yoga workout I can do and feel good about.

After watching the DVD all the way through once without doing any of the workouts, I decided to do all 5 workouts, one right after the other so I could see which I couldn't do or didn't like and which I wanted to incorporate into my exercise routine.  If you don't think that you can get a good workout in 10-minutes, I challenge you to try all 5 together--wow, what a workout!  I was spent after that!

I liked the instructor but did feel that some of the workouts went too quickly.  I understand that each workout is only 10 minutes so there is no time to waste but, even so, I felt that some things were difficult to follow because of the speed.  That improves with repetition, thankfully, but until you know the moves by heart, it can be a challenge to keep up!",1105488000,4,1794,4.28486646884273

1055015,4,6305650713,"10-Minute Solution consists of five complete 10-minute fitness programs, each showcasing a different exercise style.  The programs are designed either to stand alone or to be performed together when time permits; you can customize the workout that's right for you.  Instructor Michelle Nevidomsky Dozois is enthusiastic and motivating, and she provides good instruction for each workout style.
The video begins with Boot Camp, a mix of classic toning exercises and short, low-impact cardio intervals.  You will do lunges, bicep curls (with dumbells), tricep dips (with a chair), and push-ups for a good, full body workout.  The second workout, Pilates, consists of intensive matwork for the abdominal area.  The moves are quite challenging and would probably not be appropriate for those new to Pilates.  Workout #3 is Ballet, with simple squats and raises designed to tone the legs.  This section moves very quickly and might be a bit difficult to follow at first, especially for those unfamiliar with basic ballet terms.
The fourth workout, Kickboxing, provides a brief aerobic workout that would probably be best utilized in combination with other cardio work.  It starts with simple punches, moves into punch combinations with knee lifts, and then introduces various kicks.  Finally, there are a few basic kick-punch combinations to finish.  The last segment, Yoga, is an ideal conclusion to the workout or a nice stretch on its own.  It begins with simple seated postures, moves on to hands and knees, and then includes just a few standing poses.  This section ends with a seated stretch, and it is doable for those with all levels of flexibility.
I enjoy the variety offered by this video.  However, since the individual workouts are not very intense (with the exception of the Pilates section), I tend to use the video in combination with other workouts I own.  Some sections of this video are probably too challenging for beginners, so I think it would work best for veteran exercisers who are having difficulties finding the time to work out.",1087516800,3,2051,5.13855421686747
1055016,3,6305650713,"When purchasing this workout, my mind was saying: ""You can't get fit in 10 minutes."" I bought it anyway because I intended to do all the 10 minute exercises at once. Can this be done? Sure, it takes you 50 minutes to complete the Boot Camp, Pilates, Ballet, Kickboxing and Yoga sections.

My main issue with this workout was that each section moved so fast, it was difficult to keep up with it all the first time. After you learn the moves, it becomes slightly easier. While this doesn't seem to be a beginner workout, it might interest advanced users who might enjoy the ""speed"" challenge. If you have been doing Pilates and Yoga, you will recognize all the main moves.

I didn't really enjoy the Kickboxing section because it was much too fast, although I did incorporate some of the moves in my Walk Away the Pounds workouts just for fun. So, you can get a few kicking ideas. If you are looking for speed and creativity, this 10 minute section will amuse you.

The Ballet workout moves from side to side, first you are on one side of the chair, then the other. I like workouts where there is no chair, but the moves are rather fast and having a stabilizing object near you is probably advisable.

The instruction style is consistent throughout the entire DVD and the instructor displays perfect form. She has super-high energy and seems to excel at all types of exercise.

This DVD has three main sections:

Create a Personalized Workout
Pick One Workout
Play All

Overall an enjoyable workout if you do all five sections at once. Once I start exercising, I like to keep going for at least an hour. This might also be useful if you walk on your treadmill and then just want to do 10 additional minutes of a specific type of workout.

1055017,5,6305650713,I bought this after the birth of my son.  The workouts are very easy to follow and I can always squeeze in at least one a day.  The variety is wonderful.  I love being abouble to customize my workouts too!,1079395200,,205,4.075
1055018,1,6305650713,"but this tape is a major YUCK.  NOT for beginers.  And if you're interested in staring at a very physically fit AND BORING instructor, then by all means by the tape!  8 Min abs is a better choice and so are the 15 min workouts by Kathy Smith ""I want that body"" series.  At least both Kathy and the 8 min crew adjust the workout to suit all levels, and can keep your interest. If you are uncertain about proper form and alignement, etc.  This 10 min workout delivers yep, 5 10 minute BORING segments, w/out all the other good stuff that comes with working out/healthy fitness outlook.  There are better ways to spend the 10 bucks...",1076803200,,631,4.35042735042735
1055038,5,6305650713,I love this DVD.  It was recomended by a friend and I bought it.  Michelle is not too perky and explains things in plain English.  She gets to the workout and gets it over with.  I love the Yoga segment the most.  It is a great way to start my day.  10 minutes and I feel totally refreshed.  The poses and transitions are easy enough to follow that you can even close your eyes and listen to her voice and breathe.  It is great.  I highly recomend it.  If I can do it with an 8 month old baby with an ear infection...anyone can.,1074643200,,528,3.9903846153846154
1055039,5,6305650713,This is a great DVD if you are looking for variety and don't always have alot of time. There are hardly any props involved to do the workouts.,1074384000,,142,4.107142857142857
1055040,3,6305650713,"I've been doing the Quickfix total workout on DVD for the last few weeks and I wanted to try the 10 Minute Solution as variety. I like the idea of 10 minute workouts, and I can squeeze them into my busy schedule. I also like that the DVD has variety. HOWEVER, as an earlier reviewer mentioned, the camera is incredibly jumpy, almost to the point of making me dizzy. Plus the camera often misses the important parts of the instruction. The instructor doesn't explain hardly anything -- just jumps into it -- and I mean JUMPS. The feeling is frenetic and it's very hard to concentrate on good form. If you want a really good 10 minute workout where you'll get good explanations about form, and the proper way to do the exercise, I'd recommened the Quickfix series instead.",1071619200,5,770,4.546762589928058
1055041,4,6305650713,"There are some good workouts on this DVD and some that just don't work in ten minutes.  The toning sections (pilates, ballet, and yoga) are great, but the cardio sections (boot camp and kick boxing) are just too short.  This is a great DVD to try out different styles of exercise, and each section is simple enough for a beginner, but also challenging enough to keep doing.  Done together all five of these workouts do make a pretty good complete workout, but it's still short on cardio.
Boot camp - try to cram in a cardio workout, weight training session, ab workout, and stretching into ten minutes, and you end up doing about one rep of each exercise.  This session is okay for a warm up to other exercise or as part of a complete workout using the entire DVD
Ballet - this session is fun.  It's all bar work using a chair.  Most of the harder moves are only done one time.  The music used for this session (similar to the music used for the rest of the sessions), is horrible.
Kickboxing - This section is really too short for a cardio workout.  It's more like a warm up but it doesn't really have an adequate warm up.
Pilates -  This session mostly abdominal exercises.  The moves are done pretty quickly and not as smoothly as other pilates tapes that I've seen, but it works.
Yoga - I think the yoga section is great.  It's a little bit fast paced for traditional yoga, but it uses some of the most common moves.  It's slightly challenging, but definitely not too hard and is a great end to a workout especially at night.",1066608000,49,1529,4.382978723404255
1055042,4,6305650713,"I think these 10 min. workouts are great because I don't have to listen to some obnoxiously peppy instructor and annoying music.  I have a new daughter, and I can't express how easy it is to do 10 minute workouts here and there throughout the day!  I can give her a bottle in her playpen and do a 10 min. workout right next to her.  She watches me and sometimes even smiles at my effort.  I don't think the yoga workout is enough to really lose any weight if that's what you're after.  However, the greatest thing is to be able to combine workouts.  I just finished doing Boot Camp, Ballet, Kickboxing, and Yoga.  I'm not fond of the Kickboxing b/c I can't follow the kick series very well.  I've never done Kickboxing before, so I'm not familiar with the moves.  Also, the kicking series come later in the workout, and I'm usually pretty winded by then.  Hence, my form suffers.  I also had a pinched nerve during my pregnancy, and that makes it hard to pivot so quickly on that hip.  The Ballet is great, and she keeps you from getting too tired on one leg by switching sides constantly.  The Boot Camp was easier the second and third time b/c it's hard to follow that first time if you're not familiar with sports conditioning.  Honestly, each workout gets easier the more familiar you become with it.  I can also see a notable difference in my size.  I've lost a pant size in just about 2 weeks.  Also, even if I'm not losing as much as I wanted to, I still eat what I want, and I can see a difference in my tone, which is SOO important after having a baby!  I highly recommend getting the 8 min buns/abs/arms/legs.  I mix and match and combine to keep it interesting.  Consistency is the key!",1066262400,6,1697,4.326984126984127
1055043,3,6305650713,"There are 5 separate workouts here, each with varying degrees of fun and effectiveness.  Because each workout is only 10 minutes it will take a few times to be able to keep up - Dozois (instructor) flies from movement to movement as if you've been working together for years, and it can be a bit frustrating at first (especially Pilates, especially if you've never done Pilates before).  A workout video can succeed or fail based on the instructor, and Dozois is relatively harmless.  She works out with little fanfare - very soft music in the background, peppy instruction, hard body, somewhat inspirational.  All in all the video is OK, but nothing exceptional.",1061424000,4,663,4.892857142857143
1055044,5,6305650713,i had the vhs of the 10minutes solution that really helped me.until stop using vcr. it is better to play dvd. it's safer on dvd than vhs & dvd in in the market.,1059868800,,160,3.878787878787879
1055045,4,6305650713,"I haven't has this video for long but so far i love it. I agree with some that 10 minutes isn't a great workout, but i personally like to do all 5 exercises at once. I like it because i get 50 minutes of exercise and when i get bored with one type, its time to move onto the next! I feel with the pilates and the yoga i am getting more flexable and I love the kickboxing! Deffinitly worth the little money i spent!",1057536000,,414,3.8823529411764706
1055046,5,6305650713,"I hate to exercise but not with this DVD!  I am very busy and don't have much free time, so this works perfectly. I like the flexibility of being able to choose which exercise I want to do... Yoga, Kickboxing, Pilates, Ballet or Bootcamp.  You can choose which exercise suites your mood and do one workout for 10 minutes (anyone can spare 10 minutes a day) or you can do as many as you please.  If you don't like to exercise and are looking for a starting point, this is it.  I recommend it to everyone I know.  I have never liked to exercise but now I Love It!",1055289600,3,561,4.110091743119266
1055047,5,6305650713,"I bought this tape about a year ago from Amazon.com.  I love the tape because it gives you so many different styles of workouts.  While I don't do them all, this is the tape that got me hooked on Pilates.  I also love the Boot Camp and the Kickboxing segment of this tape.  Some of the ballet is good, but those are really the only segments I use, but they are definitely helpful and this tape is definitely worth the price!!!  My favorite part of this tape is that it helps you decide what type of workout would be ideal for you.  I know you've been there before - you buy a tape from the internet or from the store and you get home and you hate it... so you try another and another and so on.  Well, this tape is definitely for you.  You just need a set of low weight dumbells, a mat, and a kitchen chair!  That was another great aspect of this tape!  There are too many tapes out there where you need to invest another $20 just to use the tape!  Trust me, this tape is worth it!!!  Enjoy!",1053388800,2,991,4.051546391752577
1055081,4,6305650713,"I like this DVD.  The Pilates section and the end of the Ballet section are pretty tough.  I deffinitely know I'm working something!  Probably this is a better DVD for people in reasonable shape but who are just starting to work out regularly.
Of course the Cardio sections are too short.  But then we all know that it's not possible to REALLY get a good cardio workout in 10 minutes.  But for those of us who get bored quick, it's nice to pair up the kick boxing and boot camp.
THe stretches after the workouts are too short, so keep in mind that you need to hold the stretch for at least twice as long as she shows it.
The instructor is great though.  She's down to business.  Doesn't ""pep"" you to death, or talk too much.  The only thing that bugs me is that it seems that the music must have been dubbed in after the fact.  Either that or her counting just is really off the beat.  That kind of makes it hard to stay exactly with her.  But I am a little bit of a stickler for that.
This is a good DVD for people who get interrupted a lot (Like moms of young children!) Or someone who's not sure what kind of work out they would like to do.  This one gives you a little taste of yoga, ballet, kickboxing, and pilates.",1046304000,22,1220,4.122881355932203

1055083,2,6305650713,"This video lives up to its claims in that it provide five ten minutes workouts. However, there is no warm up, so you would want to stretch or something before it starts.  I could not integrate the 10 minute workouts, but if you are looking for something quick especially in the morning, this is for you.",1040947200,,303,4.410714285714286
1055084,2,6305650713,"I thought this video was far too easy.  I did not feel that any part of my body was being worked by any of the exercises.  After combining all of the exercises together, I still did not feel or notice a difference.",1027468800,4,214,4.071428571428571
1055085,5,6305650713,"This a great workout video. I tend to become very bored when it comes to working out. This video keeps me interested and actively involved. Each workout is 10 minutes long. There are 5 workouts- aerobics, pilates, ballet, kickboxing, and yoga. You can even program a workout to tailor your needs. I tend to do 2 sessions of the pilates (it really works the abs), ballet (all you need is a chair to assist you), kickboxing (you feel it in your thighs), and yoga (a nice cool-down). I do recommend this product to anyone who isn't really into walking 40 minutes on a treadmill or going to a gym. I look forward to working out everyday with this dvd!",1027296000,38,647,4.445378151260504
1055086,5,6305650713,"This tape has a lot of variety in its workouts, which kept me from getting bored with it. It is divided into five 10-minute segments, and each segment is designed to be a workout by itself. This was great for me because I have two small kids and sometimes 10 minutes is all the time I have before one of them needs me for something. On the other hand, when I get more time than that I just keep working through the segments one after the other. This way you can get up to a 50-minute workout. This is just the right type of video for getting back into shape (which I needed after my second child was born) or for getting started on a regular exercise routine if you haven't been on one previously. The Pilates segment is especially good for toning up an out-of-shape tummy; the Boot Camp and Kickboxing segments give a short but effective aerobic workout; and the Ballet and Yoga segments are nice for stretching and strengthening the muscles.",1027036800,21,943,4.425287356321839
1055087,4,6305650713,"If you're in the mood for some morning quickies(wink, wink), this is perfect.  Having to choose fromk 5 different workouts is great as well.  Tailor to your mood or maybe where what you missed during your normal workouts.  I did my normal workout on Sat. but because of interruptions wasn't able to finish my abs.  So on Monday morning b-4 work, I programmed the DVD for Kickboxing to wake me up and finished with Pilates for my abs.  Perfect!
The only thing is that you can't really hear the music too loud.

The most inspirational part of the DVD were her legs in Bootcamp!",1024876800,3,575,4.480769230769231
1055088,3,6305650713,"Overall this DVD is quite good - however I don't think you can do a proper workout in just 10 minutes.  Therefore the option to customise your workout with any combination of those contained on the DVD is useful.  Even though the DVD contains 5 workouts, you can use the customise workouts option to program 6 (ie do one more than once).
The Boot Camp section is a reasonable cardio/weights workout, focusing on hopping from side to side, lunges, squats, bicep curls, triceps, push-ups and abs.  I felt that this workout had a rushed quality, as if Michelle had her eye on the clock the whole time and just wanted to squeeze in one more exercise.  The stretches at the end were minimal.  This section uses hand weights.
The Pilates section is quite good - although not necessarily a classical pilates workout.  Michelle does ""The Hundred"" about half way through, and this exercise should be one of the first you do in a pilates session.  Again, the stretches were rushed.
I liked the Ballet section - particularly as I don't know anything about ballet.  Michelle explained plies, releves, first and section positions, etc.  I had put off buying the ""New York City Ballet"" workout after reading comments that there is not enough explanation on that DVD.  So perhaps after doing this ballet workout a few times, I'll have enough knowledge to tackle the NY workout.  This section uses a chair for balance.
The Kickboxing workout needed to be longer, even just another 2-3 minutes.  Then there would have been time for a better warm up and more stretches at the end.  The sequences were quite good, although Michelle assumed some knowledge of punches and kicks and so not everything was fully explained.  There were no side or back kicks.
The Yoga section was very good, particulary if done at the end of an exercise session.  The first couple of minutes are good upper body and leq stretches and there is a good sequence moving from Cat to Downward Facing Dog.  The standing sequence is quite good, but more time should be spent in each pose.  The meditation/relaxation section at the end was short.
Overall, I thought this DVD was OK to good.  If you really can't spare more than 10 minutes for a workout, then give it a go.  Otherwise, you'll need to do more than one workout from the DVD and spend a little time warming up and stretching on your own.",1014249600,17,2350,4.646489104116223
1055089,4,6305650713,"I have the DVD and I can see how the VHS would be annoying. In the DVD you create your own workout. I do Boot Camp, Kickboxing, Ballet, and Pilates in that order. You can change the order however you want to (i skip the yoga because i like a much longer yoga session which is Crunch Fat Burning Yoga-it's great) I am not a good exerciser-I don't like it and I have been able to stick with this dvd because as soon as I feel like I can't do it anymore the segement is over! You MUST stretch before you do this video-there is no warm up-I just put on my favorite tunes and warm up by myself. It doesn't give you a great cardio workout but it's enough when you're lazy AND it's really really good strength training. The ballet is killer on the thighs! I've been doing it for a week straight and I still sweat bullets through the barre work! I can already feel a difference in my abdominal muscles-it shows in my pilates progress. I would reccommend this video for gals like me who don't really want to exercise but want to go to the beach sometime this year in something slinky!",1014076800,11,1075,4.1980676328502415
