2672112,1,B000JJ4WEC,"Too early for that cover art. No dub music and the japanese music is sooooo bland and makes the show boring. I will however get these dragoboxes just to have every dragonball dvd release ever. But for all you none smart people who think that dub will hurt the video quality are not, well, smart. It will hurt the quality when it is 4 or 5 tracks. Its not on there, because Funimaton is treating there anime now untouched. It's not because of the video quality they are not putting it on there. I can't believe how many stupid Dragon Ball Z fans are out there.

Note: I'am fully aware that I'am going to get ambushed with negative comments. I just want you to know, I don't read them. So putting those comments are just as pointless as my review.",1259366400,8,745,4.321428571428571

The prices are ridiculous now, especially on amazon (if you really want these you should try looking around on ebay for a better price). I know this was supposed to be a limited time thing but I wish they would re-release these dragon boxes for the other fans.

Although before buying and ultimately leaving a positive/negative comment about any Dragon Ball product.  You should make sure you know what you are getting.  With that said, this was a great buy when it first came out, but I would recommend not purchasing this item at its current price.  If you are willing to buy at this price, please also consider looking into the ""Original"" Japanese Dragon Ball and DBZ box sets on Amazon.jp.  They are very steep in price, but a great find.

2672118,3,B000JJ4WEC,"Dragon Ball Z: Dragon Box Two contains episodes forty-three through eighty-four of the Dragon Ball Z anime series; these episodes cover the remainder of the Namek saga, the Captain Ginyu saga, and the early Frieza saga.  However, in the set's book, the Captain Ginyu and Frieza sagas are lumped together into the Frieza saga.

The Dragon Boxes were being marketed to the ""hardcore"" Dragon Ball fans, which was evident through some of the decisions made by the company when these sets was put together: the default language for viewing is set to Japanese language with English subtitles, the title cards for the episodes use the Japanese titles for the episodes instead of the titles for the English dub, only the original Japanese music score is included, and the packaging and booklets use the original Japanese spelling for the characters' names instead of the alternate spellings that were used in the English dub.  In addition, the episodes are presented in a 4:3 aspect ratio, instead of the 16:9 cropping that was done for the nine ""orange brick"" season sets.

Dragon Box Two comes with a 47-page hardcover book that has a right-to-left orientation.  The book begins with character profiles, which is followed by an ""Ultimate Character Relationship Chart.""  The bulk of the book, however, is a section talking about the episodes that are included in the set.  The episode section of the book includes the Japanese titles for the episodes, a description for each episode, the original airdate for each episode, still images from the episodes, trivia, and a brief overview of the story that appears on each disc in the set. There are also sections that have ""best three"" countdowns for several topics and viewers' favorite lines from the episodes in this set.  The book concludes with a section about Gohan's various encounters with animals and line art drawings of some of the characters.

A drawback to this set is the fact that there are no special features included on any of the discs; FUNimation didn't even bother to put on the textless opening and closing or any trailers.  I would guess that the company felt that since the book was included, that there really wasn't a need for special features on the discs.  Also, I was disappointed to see that the ""Marathon Feature"" from the ""orange brick"" season sets wasn't included, because it made it easier to watch the episodes back-to-back on each disc.  On the plus side, if you watch the Japanese language versions of the episodes, you get to see the next episode previews at the end of each episode; these had not been included in the original ""orange brick"" season box sets that FUNimation had released.

I would recommend Dragon Ball Z: Dragon Box Two to fans of Dragon Ball Z who want to have a better version of the episodes than what appears on the ""orange bricks.""

2672119,3,B000JJ4WEC,"I would not pay the money for these Drgon Boxes, the picture quality compared to the blu-ray version is inferior in every way.

2672120,4,B000JJ4WEC,"Ok, so I put this review together not to discuss the actual quality of the show. We're all well aware that this is the most concrete Dragon Ball Z release to date. I do however want to warn you guys that the overlapping disc setup can cause potentially disc damaging scuffs. Not scratches, but it seems that they get scuffed from chaffing in the cases. I had to buy a secondary copy of Volume 2 (all my others with the exception of 6, which amazon replaced for me with no problems were fine). My best advice to prospective buyers is to go out and maybe buy a pack of jewel cases and store them separately from the actual boxes so they don't have to share the same crawlspace. I have all the Dragon Boxes neatly displayed on my shelf with the jewel cases/discs right beside them and have had no problems since.
With this particular volume no longer in print (so it would seem), I figured I would give a heads up to all the collector types out there who do their best to keep their DBZ collection as close to pristine as possible.",1314576000,3,1028,4.304123711340206
2672121,5,B000JJ4WEC,"I didn't watch Dragon Ball or Dragon Ball Z when I was a kid. Now that I am an adult I'm loving this franchise (although I don't plan on buying or watching GT). It was recommended that I start with Dragon Ball, so I did and I loved it. I've bought Dragon Box 1-5 and am working my way through them and loving every minute.

I can't compare the boxes to the orange bricks (as they are called) because I don't own any of the previous release, but I like that they add a really nice 48 page hard back book with each of these boxes.

I'm not going to break down the technical aspects of the dvd set or the story arcs, because many others have done this very well. Much better than I could do. But I wanted to add a short review for adults who may have neglected watching this series. I find myself laughing many times at the humor...especially in Dragon Ball.

I encourage to get box 2 as soon as possible because it looks like it's gone out of print. Right now the prices don't look bad, but I wouldn't wait long. I don't know if they will re-release the dragon boxes.

Highly recommended.",1310601600,2,1086,4.181818181818182
2672122,5,B000JJ4WEC,"As a youth, I grew up on Dragon Ball Z: now approaching my 21st birthday, I decided to pick up the first to box sets on a whim to see if this series had aged well and just because I feeling nostalgic.

DESIGN OF THE BOX SET AND PACKAGING

Because this is a collection and because part of owning the box set is the actual box, I would like to discuss a little bit about how it looks and all the little physical features.

First off, the art on the front of the box is very clear and crisp and looks just plain cool. The hard side of the box has a little Dragon Ball on the side to notify you as what volume you are opening up. However, because this was made in Japan and just translated over, the box dvd containers will read right to left instead of the standard North American standard of left to right. Nothing big, just pointing that out. Slotted in between the 2 dvd containers is a book that contains episode information, artwork and trivia. It is in full color and is a nice little addition. Plastered on the ends of the containers is one of those image things that when lined up with the other box sets will create an image of Goku doing something (I don't know what it is quite yet because I a only have the first two boxes).

Overall, the design is nice and the artbook is a nice throw in
4/5

DVD's
The real reason anyone would want to buy this is the content on the disk. I am going to keep this short just because this is Dragonball Z and unless you have been living under a rock, you probably already know the story for this.

The quality of the video is very nice and crisp: quite good for its time actually. The big thing for hardcore collectors is that there is a Japanese audio option that is actually the default setting with English subtitles. Seeing as how I don't speak Japanese,I could not faithfully tell if the audio synced up properly or not. Changing over to the English side though, and I must say, this one can be a little rough. This was dubbed over in a time when this was still a bit of a challenge and some of dialogue can be a little choppy or odd. Still, it is uncut and still has its' own crowning moments of awesome. The only real problem I have with the content is that there isn't an option for the American original soundtrack. While the Japanese one is nice, I still prefer the American guitar to the Japanese horn and orchestra.
5/5

In the end, the final score is all that matters and really, this is the definitive DBZ box set. It has all of the episodes (filler included), is uncut, and has the packaging of kings. I highly recommend this to Dragon Ball Z fans young and old a like.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Dragon Ball Z"" via this ""Dragon Box Z Vol. 2' set contains episodes featured in standard definition (4:3 aspect ratio). The colors are much different than the previous box set where colors were deeper and more pronounced, the colors of the series features its original presentation as it was in Japan and of course, restored frame by frame in which the previous season was not. Personally, I don't have a preference to which is better but if anything, this set is for the hardcore fans who preferred the original Japanese presentation.

But for a series that debuted back in 1989, you have to acknowledge how good the transfer was for this restoration. Granted, there is a ""Dragon Ball Kai"" currently airing in Japan in High Definition but for this release, considering it's 20-years-later, for the diehard fans who have wanted these episodes in its original presentation for so long, Pony Canyon definitely did a very good job on restoration and again, great to see FUNimation Entertainment bring this box set to the US.

As for audio, this is where things are a bit different from the original Japanese audio presentation. Because FUNimation Entertainment had to include the English dubbed audio, instead of using the 448 kb/s audio, they went with 96 kb/s. This may upset fans who wanted a higher bitrate but because its important to attract those who are prefer English dubs and make the set even more marketable, the English dub had to be included. With that being said, I've grown up watching the Japanese audio and typically, I prefer to watch anime in Japanese BUT with ""Dragon Ball Z"", I have always felt that the English dub was among the best out there and the voices just sound right for the characters.

But the intention for this box set was for those who wanted the Japanese audio. Personally, it's a preference that I would rather have 5.1 surround versus mono or stereo soundtracks. And when I do, I typically set my receiver to stereo on all channels since I have a 7.2 setup. But fans will be happy that they get the original Japanese audio for the complete episode, previews for the next episode, opening and ending theme and you get Hironobu Kageyama's ""Cha-La, Head-Cha-La"" instead of the Falcouner score.

Subtitles are in English.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Dragon Box Z Vol. 2' doesn't come with any  special features but it comes with cool packaging and an awesome booklet. What we have is a yellow slip case box with Goku on the front, unlike the season box sets which were gateway folded, the DVD's are presented in two foil covered DVD cases and are presented in Japanese style with the first disc on the right hand side and the two discs on the left.

Also included is a hardcover 50-page booklet titled ""Dragonbook"" in Japanese style which has information on each character, episode summary, fashion and design works collection are featured. It's a pretty solid presentation for the hardcore fans and I have to admit, looks way cooler than the previous orange box sets.

JUDGMENT CALL:

For the most part, this DVD box set is definitely worth it. But before fans who have bought the original single volumes and then the season box sets go on a tirade of having another version of ""Dragon Ball Z"" released, the main thing to remember is that those who have been vocal from the start were the diehard fans. They wanted the original 4:3 aspect ratio, they wanted the original Japanese presentation and the could care less about the English dubs and the Falcouner score.

Personally, the season box sets are still solid for those who are not so demanding. This box set is primarily for those hardcore fans and FUNimation Entertainment are giving those fans what they wanted for so long and I see that as quite admirable because they invested in bringing this release stateside and preparing it for the American consumer. And for those not familiar with those season box sets, well the good news is that the English dub is featured as well.

Do I have a preference on which I like better? Well having watch both...and enjoying the season box sets, I am actually content with both but I will have to say that ""Dragon Box Z"" has a much cooler packaging presentation and about 6-8 more episodes but you will be paying about $15 more. So, it's really up to you if it's worth it. Personally, if you just want to see the episodes and prefer to watch it with the English dubs, the original season box sets can be found for a great price these days and were solid releases to begin with, it was just not to the liking of those who wanted the original Japanese presentation.

This box set was created for those who wanted ""Dragon Ball Z"" to be presented how it was in Japan and they have waited a long, long time for it. So, I look at these box sets as fans are now getting the best of both worlds and now those fans should be happy. Now the only thing is left will be the Blu-ray fans who will be clamoring for ""Dragon Ball Kai"" (""Dragon Ball Z"" minus the filler episodes, remastered with new intro and vocals all re-recorded) and want their HD fix and truthfully, I can't wait to see how gorgeous the series will look whenever it is released in the US especially with lossless HD Japanese audio, but for now, don't expect DBK to come out in the US anytime soon. Your good with the original season box sets or the Dragon Box set. Again, both are solid releases.

In terms of the the episodes featured in this volume, the Freeza saga is possibly the longest saga in the ""Dragon Ball Z"" series (especially if you include the Planet Namek series) as the majority of the episodes focus on Vegeta, Gohan, Kuririn and Bulma.  There are a good number of battles and Vegeta fans will surely love this volume as he takes on Freeza's henchmen and then the battle against the Ginyu Force begins.  As for Goku fans, you'll have to wait until vol. 3 because the battle between Goku and Freeza is coming up soon!  And definitely one of my favorite story arcs of the ""Dragon Ball Z"" series.

Overall, for its presentation, 40+ episodes in its original presentation, remastered and its' cool packaged content... for those hardcore fans who have waited this long, ""Dragon Ball Z - Dragon Box Vol. 2' is highly recommended.",1268179200,,6366,4.630878438331854
2672131,5,B000JJ4WEC,"this is pretty much all of the ginyu special corp.  yea, its commander ginyu instead of captain, and its ginyu special corp. not ginyu force for all you dub fans.  so the next boxset is going to be the freeza saga. this is were the drawings start to become dbz instead of dragonball drawings. right when goku lands and starts taking on the ginyu special corp. the drawings start taking affect. then when you get into the freeza saga thats when its really becomes dbz drawings and it just gets better along the way. so if you started collecting the dragon box then there is no reason for you not to get this, but once again this is a japanese soundtrack with no english music, meant for the hardcore fans.",1267401600,,704,4.407692307692308
2672132,5,B000JJ4WEC,"This DBZ Dragon Box series is an exciting thing. I've been a fan of DBZ since I first saw it on syndicated television in the mid to late '90s. (You could say I was a fan of the series even earlier, about '95 or '96 or so, since I also watched the first thirteen episodes of Dragon Ball when that first aired in the States.)

Ever since becoming a fan of DBZ and having just around that time discovered the Internet, I searched for the series on Yahoo! and came up with a website which displayed many of the changes made in the US--all of the censorship, reworked music, and all of that. Since then, I've been clamoring for Dragon Ball Z, uncut and subbed with the original music.

I thought FUNimation were going to deliver with the season sets they released a few years ago, but they botched the job entirely by ""remastering"" the video in the most awful way imaginable: in addition to the drastically cropped framing (to create a faux-widescreen ratio--I'm BIG on original aspect ratio as it affects cinematography and composition), careless and unwatched DVNR was applied, a process which is intended to eliminate dirt and scratch marks that are present on the film being scanned, but when used so carelessly, it can do devastating things to video, especially animation, where lines of art are ""erased"" (that is, the lines are read by the program as scratch marks, so it takes color and other visual information surrounding the lines and then covers over the lines with this information, causing lines of art to disappear, particularly quick/fast-paced animation). To make matters worse, the colors and lighting are all blown-out and faded. (I'm not too familiar with technical terms; this could be due to contrast boosting, but I'm uncertain.)

FUNimation have finally delivered with this Dragon Box series, porting the expertly restored video masters from Japan. THIS is what I've wanted all along; I never bothered with bootleg fansubs back in the day because of poor quality tapes transferred several times over. With the video on these sets, you get a good amount of natural film grain (something that should NEVER be done away with entirely [or even at all if I had my way], particularly since important detail IS ALWAYS LOST when you do so) that really gives it an authentic look. It really does look like an anime from the '80s/early '90s, and to this fan, that is a very good thing indeed.

A lot of people appear to be complaining about these DVD releases for a variety of reasons, many of which seem silly to me. I'm not certain how much more compression would need to be applied to all the audio tracks and perhaps the video to add an additional audio track (many appear to prefer the US dub music, which is not present on these sets), but if adding an extra track noticeably degrades the quality of what I want to watch and hear, then I'm A-OK with the US music not being included--particularly since it's inferior and also not the original music. Does nobody care about original intention and preserving art anymore?

Many who complain about these Dragon Box sets also don't seem to see a reason for them--they comment that the video on the season sets FUNimation released earlier is ""good enough."" Well, it's certainly not good enough for me, and I'm thankful that FUNimation are releasing these now, and I hope that they don't compromise on future releases to try and please everybody. These Dragon Box sets SHOULD have been what FUNimation released initially, rather than jerking everyone's chains, but they've chosen to make poor decisions and milk the series for all they can get. This, however, is one DVD release series that I will give in to, for this is what I've WANTED all along, and I will pay the premium price for what I see to be a premium product line.

The packaging is also quite nice, and as I mentioned on my DBZ: Dragon Box Z, Volume One review, I ponder if it's modeled after the Japanese Dragon Box sets. High-quality materials, two digi-books which house the DVDs, nice artwork, and a book that contains episode descriptions, where everything is listed in a right-to-left reading format, which is what makes me wonder if it's similar to what the Japanese fans got years back.

So, if you don't know Japanese (that is, if importing the Japanese DVDs would be practically worthless to you) and are looking for Dragon Ball Z the way it's MEANT to be seen and heard--at long last, these are the DVDs to buy!",1266796800,16,4443,4.69576379974326
2672133,5,B000JJ4WEC,"I used to be one of those individuals that would criticized the dragon box because of the lack of Bruce Faulconer music and because the price was significantly higher. Since I'm a fan of the series I couldn't help myself and I found my self pre-ordering the first Dragon Box to find out what the big deal was. I knew deep down that I wasn't gonna be to happy with the Japanese music.

Once I received the box I realized how incredibly well packaged everything comes. It already made the orange bricks look cheap and I had yet to open the box. The dragon box was about the size of two orange bricks (remastered sets) and the smaller boxes inside were beautifully build. The booklet that's included with the set is very handy when watching the episodes and its hardcover and not held together with a single staple like in the orange bricks.

The quality of the video is superb, its near perfect and the colors are beautiful. I found my self looking at all the vivid colors and seeing detail I had not seen before. It was truly like watching a different version of Dragon ball Z. This is the way Dragon ball Z should have been released from the start!

Now on to the music, when I first started watching the series I wanted the American music! Since I couldn't have it, I just stop complaining and decided to watch it and appreciate it. I found my self loving the Japanese music. Before I knew it I just couldn't go back to the American version. It's almost like watching an entirely new show. Try the Japanese music and it will grow on you after each episode.

I also want to mention that I did own the orange Bricks, but now that I own the First dragon box I've sold all the orange bricks on Amazon.

Now as a conclusion if you have the orange bricks, sell them and get your self the real definitive Edition. Watch the series the way it was originally intended.  For those who don't own the Dragon Box, don't give the box bad review's, just because you didn't acquire this version first instead of the orange bricks. This is the best release of Dragon Ball Z to date! Appreciate its release! Buy the dragon box you won't regret it.

The Dragon Box shows you the series as originally intended and you won't miss the American music.

Dragon Box Volume 3 May 4, 2010!

2672134,4,B000JJ4WEC,"Let's begin.

----

CONS:

1. First off, I'm going to address the lack of the U.S. music. I know a lot of people don't like his music and compare it to both ""stupid rock"" and ""Casio demo music"", but some honestly prefer the score created by Bruce Faulconer (And Dragon Ball Kai's music is much closer to Faulconer's music than the original Japanese music. Just saying.). I don't care very much about his score during the Frieza (I don't like the spelling ""Freeza."" That okay with everyone!?) related sagas, but it is definitely an improvement during the Cell Games (which the Dragon Boxes should to during the fourth or fifth Dragon Box, if you were wondering). And don't start saying, ""If they included it on here, then we'd lose the Dragon Box's great video!"" That simple issue could be fixed by having fewer episodes per disk. Then, add a seventh disk to each Dragon Box and everyone could be happy. The price would go up no more than another $5 (Not like that should matter as the Dragon Boxes were each going to cost $80, and I didn't see anyone complaining...).

2. The original Dragon Boxes had animated menus. Ours don't because the addition of the English audio. Really, the lack of the animated menus could also be fixed by having an extra disk (same fix I suggested to get both versions of the English audio). This would also help get across the number 7 (as 7 Dragon Boxes are to be released; this is suppose to represent the 7 dragon balls). Apparently no one at FUNimation thought of this...

3. Then there is the issue of the top of the box peeling a bit (Others seem to have issue with the bottom peeling, but mine is at the top...). This is a manufacturing issue that is easily fixed with a bit of glue, but it shouldn't exist. It's just a lack of quality control. While it isn't a big issue now, it could become one in the future if not corrected immediately. I'm not referring to the peeling of the box but rather how lax FUNimation is becoming about the quality of their products.

4. This Dragon Box is the one that should have included ""Bardock - The Father of Goku"" as the Japanese equivalent did at this point. It inexplicably doesn't. There's no reason given why it doesn't, either. It should have been right between episode 63 and episode 64, but it's just not... I know the original Dragon Box had ""Bardock"" on another disc itself (same disc as ""The History of Trunks""), but that's because the original Dragon Box itself contained such a large number of episodes. Ours doesn't, so they should have just included it on this set.

PROS:

1. This is the best image we've seen on any DBZ release to date. However, this will be made untrue with the release of Dragon Ball Kai (Or Dragon Ball Z Kai) in May of this year.

2. The price is great. The Japanese Dragon Boxes were each over $800, so the two went for at least $1600... FUNimation decided to release more Dragon Boxes for far less. Let's assume you're going to buy all seven American Dragon Boxes for $45 each. This comes out to a mere $315. Honestly, the savings on these Dragon Boxes are their best selling point.

3. The entry for Master Roshi in the Dragon Book. I'm not going to spoil it, but it's hilarious. I honestly would have included the Dragon Book as a negative if not for this entry (This is because they didn't include a ""History of DBZ timeline"" in this book for some odd reason...). The rest of the Dragon Book is just uninteresting... Well, except the character designs. Those are always cool.

----

Now, I do have one other thing to say that isn't a pro or con. There is some yellow around the logo and summary info on the front. It is only apparent on Vegeta's armor when you look really close, so it isn't really an issue. I guess that was to make the text easier to read, but it doesn't.

----

Conclusion:

You should get this set. It is far from perfect, but it has a great price and has the best image we'll ever see of DBZ. Well, that's only true till the release of Dragon Ball Kai this May.",1266624000,3,4006,4.407859078590786

If you prefer DBZKAI then wait until May 18th because it will be on Blu-ray, for all your Blu-ray collectors. If you got the Orange Bricks, sorry to say but you have to re buy either this or DBZKAI to watch DBZ in its best. I am such a HARD CORE fan that I got all Orange Bricks and I'm going to get all the Dragon Boxes and Dragon Ball Z Kai DVDs. But yea every Dragon Ball Z fan has to pick these up. My only complaint is that it doesn't come with T.v specials like the Japanese did but hey at least we are getting the series in this quality and that's all that matters.",1266537600,,672,3.948529411764706
2672136,5,B000JJ4WEC,"Given all the past dramatic turnabouts and FUNimation's rocky DBZ history, the Dragon Boxes has proven once again its overall superiority of the original DBZ series in DVD format.

PICTURE: Fantastic remastering from the original 16mm film from Toei. The ""genuine"" copies, so to speak. Not much different from what I've said in my previous review. There is one minor gripe, though. I've noticed some shaky cam movement in some of the episodes. I don't know if this has do with some frame alignment issues that existed in the original films or a remastering error. In any case, it's a minor issue that doesn't greatly affect the quality of the picture. When it does happen, it can become quite glaring, but it's over just as quickly.

AUDIO: The Japanese mono is a great as it could ever be. Shunsuke Kikuchi's operatic 80s Kung-Fu/Shaw Brothers-like score compliments the age and content of the material. Often offering the same or similar pieces on a loop episode after episode, it can becoming a bit glaring, but it suits the material just fine. There's enough ""breathing space"", so to speak, between each piece that the mood it evokes in each particular scene is quite effective. Examples being when Vegeta is told by Kiwi/Cui that Freeza is after the Dragon Balls in Namek or when Vegeta is closing in on Gohan and Kuririn's/Krillin's ki suspecting something's afoot. The Japanese cast, whether you love or hate Masako Nozawa's performance as Son Goku, is strongly and consistently supported by a much stronger supporting cast. Nods go to Ryo Horikawa as Vegeta and Ryusei Nakao as Freeza. Their evil characteristics are perfectly portrayed and the interaction between them is often snide and tense.

I can't comment on the English dub, but I've heard that there were some lipsynching/ audio issues with alignment of the film on the first Dragon Box. Not having the US Broadcast track is also a big disadvantage considering the majority of dub fans would want it more so than the original score. I simply can't understand why FUNimation just didn't leave the dub as is. Was it to make amends for the show's treatment? In any case, this leaves a dub that very few people like from what I understand of the community.

CONTENT & PACKAGING: The second Dragon Box includes episodes 43-84. That's 42 episodes spanning from the Fake Namek filler through Freeza's final transformation. Watching these episodes were both a delight to rediscover and dreadful to watch reminding me of DBZ's often stereotypical and infamous pacing. The Freeza arc is the second most gulity of this (the Cell arc being the first). It's pretty much where the various transformation stages took place often spanning episodes, in this case five, and sometimes even taking up half the episode. While DBZ's archaic nature of massively epic and long ""power-ups"" is mostly true, it doesn't detriment the quality of the series. It can fun and dreadful at the same time, depending on your outlook of the series. Eventually it all pays off leading to the both epic and dreadful fight of Son Goku vs. Freeza (which took about 10-15 episodes) in the next Dragon Box set. There's a payoff, but you must have Zen-like patience.....or the fast forward button. The Ginyu Special Forces episodes are fun and well paced for the most part. Goku coming in beating the crap out of ReaCoom, Jheese, and Butta is probably one of the best moments in the series. Well animated, well acted, and well timed.

Dragon Box 2 also contains Cell arc Vegeta as designed by Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru, character designer for the TV series, and Dragon Book vol. 2. This set is very Vegeta-centric in its episodes and seeing as how that was the only Vegeta design available from the original Dragon Box prints, perhaps FUNimation just thought it to be best. The Dragon Book includes more character profiles, relationship charts, episode guide, design works and new Dragon Column featurettes as ""Impressive Words"", phrasing some of the best lines in the series, ""Son Gohan's Animal Adventure"", listing the animals Gohan encountered through out the series, and more. Overall, the slick replication of the original Dragon Box prints and Dragon Book tidbits is a little more than icing to the cake, often educating newcomers and fans alike of the Dragon World.

OTHER THOUGHTS/CONCLUSIONS: As I feared, the Bardock TV special wasn't included with this set considering it aired alongside these episodes. Since FUNimation considers both the Bardock and Trunks TV specials as ""features"" perhaps they will be included with the Dragon Box The Movies prints they also purchased, but that remains to be seen. Overall, the set is as fantastic as the previous one. Unless you're really enamoured with the US Broadcast Music, this set is really the highest recommendation for DBZ viewing. It's just unfortunate these won't sell well enough due to lack of US Broadcast Music and various prior releases. I also fear for its future considering the acquisition of Dragon Ball Kai from FUNimation. It might greatly affect the future of the Dragon Boxes. In any case, get them while they're still around.",1266192000,3,5118,4.966161026837806

That this is the fourth DBZ video release, but here me out. THis is a set design for the hardcore audience like me. Speaking of me, I was one of the many fans that got all the flimsy Oragne Cropped sets. At first when I heard about this, I was against it. But when I saw WolfClawStudios' Review and read the article on Daizenshuu EX about the Home Video Release of the series, I was hooked!

Why we can watch the American dub with Japanese music on the blu-ray movies, but no original Japanese voices with the American music?  I've gotten used to the original Japanese music but I would be really pleased if we could have the original voices with subtitles and the American tracks.  That would be awesome and I think a ton of people agree.

Also, I've read that the original Japanese Dragon Boxes (either box 1 or box 2) had additional stuff, like the OVA 'The plan to destory the Sayijns' and I see no evidence that the American Dragon Boxes are going to contain that.

Can anyone clear this up for me?  Also, do we think these will ever be released in a blu-ray format?",1263254400,,820,4.3202614379084965

All though this doesn't have the DUB on it, it is still an awesome thing for any DBZ lover to own. BUT, this set is more of a collectors item for me. Mainly because instead of having to move my eyes from the action to have to read subs, I would rather just like to sit and enjoy watching the Z-fighters beat each other to death while I know what they are saying. So enough of this purist BS, if you love the show you love the show. And individuals dub or sub preferences are irrelevant. All DBZ lovers are purists, The End.",1260835200,6,639,4.12
2672141,5,B000JJ4WEC,"Usually I am entirely against posting a review of a product before it has even been released. That being said, there are few sad and bitter individuals who neither purchased the previous box, nor plan on purchasing this or any of these phenomenal sets in the future. These individuals have ignorantly bestowed a single star upon their ""reviews"" for want of a dated English music track to go along with their dated English dub. This particular group has already been catered to multiple times over the past several years. Prior releases which DO feature the old dub score include both individual volumes and boxed ""season"" sets. These individuals and their misguided ""reviews"" need to be counter-balanced. Why have they done this? Simply put, they either don't understand or don't appreciate the purist nature of these sets or the fact that they are not meant to appease fans of the English dub.

The Funimation Dragonboxes are(and always have been)intended to be more or less a replication of the remastered Japanese Dragonbox releases from years prior. This release is both a gift and a response to the thousands of fans who have wanted to see their favorite anime presented as it was originally broadcast in Japan with the best picture quality possible and in its original aspect ratio...without having to spend thousands of dollars importing (if they could FIND them) the original sets from Japan.

Fans of the dub argue that there is enough room left on the DVD to incorporate an extra uncompressed music track without having to compromise either the video or audio quality of the original. Honestly, that may be true. It may also be wishful thinking from a group of angry people too lazy to read subtitles and hate Japanese music. I honestly don't know what 1.5GB of space can hold and honestly it doesn't matter when you get right down to it. The fact of the matter is that the inclusion of the English dub was an afterthought from the folks at Funimation and originally it wasn't slated to be part of the Region 1 Dragonbox releases AT ALL. Dub fans should consider themselves lucky that they are able to enjoy such a beautiful release at such a great price for 42 episodes AND have their unfortunate dub/adaption audio track included as well. Why taint it with synthesizer music from the dark days of edited anime?

I definitely understand the need for nostalgia, but that is what the previous releases of this series were meant for. The Dragonbox = STAUNCH PURIST and that is a 5 star product in my eyes! So please, do yourself a favor and treat your senses to the beauty of the Dragonbox before it's out of print (which it WILL be) and gone forever. Just say NO to the orange bricks. You won't regret it, I promise!",1260748800,4,2725,4.732631578947369
2672142,5,B000JJ4WEC,"After the abomination of the FUNimation season sets, North American Dragon Ball fans had come to the conclusion that we had no chance of receiving a proper release of DBZ.  Thankfully, FUNi apparently was given the opportunity to release the series using the Dragon Box masters from Japan.

Instead of a ""remastering"" that involved cropping the top and the bottom of the screen to fit people's widescreen TVs, pushing the saturation to disgusting levels, and blurring everything in order to remove grain and pretend that the series wasn't made in 1989, the Dragon Box footage is essentially an extensive clean up of the film by Toei Animation (the studio that animated the series) and Pony Canyon (the company that manufactured the DVDs in Japan).  They were able to use the original 16mm film reels as the source footage for the cleanup, meaning that this is the closest thing to the original animation cels that exist.  Toei/Pony Canyon removed all dirt and other imperfections in the film in addition to realigning the frames to prevent almost all instances of screen jittering.

This North American release of the Dragon Box includes audio tracks for the English dub (with the original Japanese score written by Shunsuke Kikuchi, also known for his work on Kamen Rider and Mazinger Z), and a remastered Japanese audio track, which is the default audio track.

Notably missing is the audio track for the broadcast English dub with a replaced score produced exclusively for the dub.  Most likely, this was done in order to preserve the bitrate of the video (the most important aspect of the whole set), or possibly so FUNimation can start treating DBZ like a legitimate English dub and not some 4kids-styled dub.  There are fans who are unhappy about this, and it is unfortunate that they cannot watch the series as they remember it.  Though, I ask the dub fans to give the score a chance, you may be impressed, though the score is definitely quirky, which can be off-putting for someone who only knows the dub score.

Anyone who loves this series should pick up this set.  Also, any people who are interested in this epic series, there's no better way to watch it than these box sets.",1260489600,8,2187,4.820855614973262

So just shut up and accept it instead of giving 1-star reviews to a product that wasn't meant for you in the first place. I don't necessarily agree with Funi's decisions and would rather have a release that satisfies all audiences, but regardless, we've been catered to for years so we should let the fans of the Japanese version have a release they can be proud of. We're lucky we got a dub in the first place as Funi made this release so that fans of the Japanese version can just watch the show as it was meant to be seen.

8150712,5,B000JJ4WEC,"If you're checking this second volume out, you've probably already viewed the first box and read about the differences between these and the orange bricks.  If you haven't, do a quick search on the web, either web page search or image search.  People complain about the Japanese audio quality, listen very carefully - Dragon Ball Z was created and stopped running in the mid 90's!  Think about TV shows in the early/mid 90's in the U.S. animated or not, and for further comparisons if you know anything about the British TV show Doctor Who, early on entire episodes were trashed and/or recycled!  Yes in the 70's episodes were no longer trashed, but some episodes were only saved in black and white with chroma dots that were used to restore color.  How does that relate to DBZ?  Well technology didn't advance THAT far from the mid/late 70's to the late 80's and early/mid 90's, and cost saving measures were (and still are) used.

Dragon Ball Z also had many problems getting through successfully to American TV!  Originally it was cut and censored and limited to part of the Namek saga.  It later got more episodes, but that was only after repeating the episodes they had over and over again.  This was STILL limited because it ended with Goku landing on Namek and giving Recoom the elbow.  These episodes were ALSO recycled for at least a couple of years, because it wasn't until around the Year 2000 - which was the Chinese Year of the Dragon coincidentally - that DBZ had the rest of its episodes dubbed in English (progressively more horribly too, oddly enough.) and then shown in completion.

Dragon Box is STILL the best option for those of us who are huge fans of the series!  If you're a CASUAL fan, that's fine, go buy the orange bricks for dirt cheap and watch it with the horrible pan-and-scan.  Think about WHY those orange bricks are so cheap - they're ubiquitous and not very high quality.  It's cheap, in both senses of the word.  These are expensive because they're both Out-Of-Print, and high quality.  If you're a fan of the American version of Dragon Ball Z, don't waste your time or money buying these - they're not meant for you anyway.",1451174400,,2160,4.6421052631578945

8150718,5,B000JJ4WEC,"Although this set is expensive, I'd say it's worth the money. This is a great set. And as the cover may suggest, it does tend to focus a lot on vegeta, more so than any other dragon box.
these episodes are some of many that really started making dragon ball z the most popular anime in America. That being said, if you liked the music you heard from the ocean dub and fun Imation dubs, they are nonexistent here. You'll only have the Japanese music, with Japanese voice cast or English voice cast, and of course subtitles for Japanese audio. Personally, I like the original Japanese better. The music is not harsh or annoying, as I do find that the English dub music is. I mean really, when I'm watching an awesome show like dragon ball z, I don't want to hear bad metal. I want to hear something that fits the show.
Now about the crop. The orange brick season sets and the blu ray season sets both crop the picture of the show to fit it into a 16:9 picture, or your now-standard tv. But dragon ball was almost never filmed in a 16:9 format, meaning that if you buy the orange brick season sets, you're getting part of the picture but not all. Not to mention that lots of the color is overly-brightened and it looks awful. The blu ray sets I hear, are even worse with even bigger picture loss. If you buy the dragon boxes, you'll be getting the complete, most definitive picture quality you could possibly get from any U.S. Dragon ball z DVD box set release. Not to mention the lovely box set itself, which is made of chipboard box, with DVDs that have a different character for each disc, and the very nice accommodation of the ""perfect guide"" including episode summaries, character profiles, character designs, and little extras as well.

8150720,5,B000JJ4WEC,"The second half of what started it all for the US fans!  This Dragon Box, as with all seven Dragon Boxes are great for those of us that fell in love with the show but enjoy the original version as opposed to the dub.  This Dragon Box drops you in the Namek Saga and pulls you back out just as the Frieza fight starts to heat up.

Why I like it:  It's Dragon Ball Z in it's original (all-be-it) remastered form.  These were taken from the Japanese Dragon Box masters and they look great!  And if you're into aspect ratios and you don't care about the black bars on your TV (because it really DOESN'T matter) this has the entire frame presented.  The audio is as to be expected from the old mono masters of the '80s and '90s.  It comes with a small book detailing character trees, episode summaries, and other goodies as well.  It also has the US Dub included in 5.1 surround.

The nitpicky:  The US Dub.  I understand that a lot of us wanted the english voice cast with the original music, but here it kind of falls flat.  Especially when you start getting into the Frieza arc and you go from having a 2009 redub of the Saiyan and Namek saga with actors that have had years of experience voicing these characters, back to the old dubs where there was a bit (a lot) of over acting and other dialogue issues.  The problem is that the voices were meant FOR THE US SOUNDTRACK.  Not the Japanese track.  It doesn't fall flat because it's bad...simply because they don't mesh with each other.  If they had written and recorded the script for the Japanese sound track it would probably be fine, but it seems as though they didn't and it comes over as ""just kind of 'meh.'""

The bad:  Price wise:  Dragon Box Two is the modern equivalent of Dragon Ball GT:  Final Bout.  Newer fans might not get that reference.

Who should by this:  Any fan of Dragon Ball Z that wants their frames uncropped and lovingly remastered to be the best that it can be.  Fans of the original Japanese Dub, or if you're a fan of the US voices with the Japanese sound track.  If however you very much enjoy your U.S. Broadcast (which I do enjoy by the way), then this is probably not for you.",1386028800,2,2159,4.295285359801489
