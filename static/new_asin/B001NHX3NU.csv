8327077,5,B001NHX3NU,"Eastern Promises, well acted and written story. Has a bit of a twist at the end. This is a story about the Russian mob in UK ( and probably  in the USA for that matter) Viggo is amazing as usual. Naomi Watt's character is believable. Has a stellar supporting international cast.
Never seen 21 Grams. It was pretty good as well.",1521590400,,327,4.360655737704918
