But it had no English Not even in menu and no poster!!!
It was so hard knowing what to select.
There is 3 disc first 2 where concert. 3rd disc was a movie with still no English at all... however, the 2nd disc had such an awesome lighting and video effects. Every fan should not miss it will remain one of my favorites. I would definitely recommend it. I'm so glad I got this.",1483920000,,385,4.078947368421052
