8268193,3,B00180IPYO,"Saeko (Michiko Saky) is a female doctor who delivers babies. At age 16 three boys had their way with her and she contracted syphilis. Apparently she kept the syphilis. As an adult she goes out and entices men to infect them. She also performs her own abortions. Lately she has been having trouble and adds a doctor to help her, a man who seems to know compassion, someone she doesn't want to kill off with disease.

Some of the film is in color whole other portions are in black and white. The change seemed to be done for no other reason, than ""what film do we have available."" Considered a cult classic. I thought ""Nurse"" to be far better entertainment.

8268194,4,B00180IPYO,"'MADAME O' (1967) is a classic and controversial Asian tale of revenge from late 1960s Japan. Raped and left for dead and w/ a wicked strain of syphyllis at the tender age of 16, our forever-scarred heroine goes on to become a Doctor attempting to find a cure by day, and a woman who picks up men to contaminate them w/ her disease by night. Director Seiichi Fukuda uses widescreen cinematography and an unusual mix of both black and white and color imagery to drive home his gore, nudity and shocking violence for the time. It succeeds beautifully all around. The plot gets deeper when the good doctor marries and suspects something fishy in her husband`s past. Say no more. This Asian cult classic is far better than others like 'The Bite-Japanese Slave Girls', or 'Slave Widow', both of which were a waste of time and cash.",1267574400,4,826,4.625850340136054
