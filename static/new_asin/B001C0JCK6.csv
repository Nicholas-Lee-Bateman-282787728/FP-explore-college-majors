8285546,1,B001C0JCK6,"Be warned - this DVD is in Italian dubbed with Italian subtitles and no english or other language option.
It cost more to return it than to buy it so I threw it in the bin - first Amazon ripoff after many years - very disappointing that an Italian DVD would be presented to me on the site.
Oh well - lesson learned.",1494633600,,315,4.015873015873016

8285548,5,B001C0JCK6,"This is an amazing movie. But keep in mind that it was meant to be part of a trilogy - the other two movies were never made (due to budget issues?) So if you're looking to watch a movie about the great Khan's conquests and life as a ruler, you'll be disappointed. This movie is about his origin and early life - which in my opinion is equally fascinating. This film is so completely and wonderfully authentic and immersive that you'll feel like you're THERE.

I wish this was available on blu-ray.",1450656000,,497,4.4021739130434785

I think Genghis khan's life and conquests are just too big for the ""Big Screen"".",1448064000,,247,5.526315789473684

8285553,4,B001C0JCK6,"I purchased this DVD because I had read an online report stating that it was one of the most historically accurate videos in the war genre. I fully expected more of the movie to depict the conquests of Ghengis Khan, but instead the great majority of the movie detailed the boyhood and young adult years in the life of Temudgin (his given name). My efforts to find verification of the chronicles of the early life of Ghengis Khan resulted in the general consensus of archivists that little is really known of his early years, but what is definitely known is portrayed in this film, and largely based on some ancient texts researched by the writers. With that being said, I enjoyed the video very much, and it was plain to see why he was able to unite the various groups of Mongols into one great kingdom rivaled in history by few others. Temudgin's relationship with his wife Borte' and his friendship/rivalry with Jamukha make for an interesting story, but Temudgin's visits to a seemingly holy place to seek direction while a wolf moves behind the rocks and thunder and lightning appear overhead seems more like Moses and the burning bush, and appear to be license taken by the movie writers. Finally, the use of Mongol language by the characters, along with English subtitles, lends a depth of realism to the movie that I personally enjoyed. For those history buffs who are looking to piece together a collection of great military leaders and their exploits, this DVD is worth having in such a library.",1428192000,8,1504,4.722433460076045

The story is fantastic & based on historical accuracy as much as possible. You will not be bored watching this movie!!",1409356800,7,335,4.859649122807017
