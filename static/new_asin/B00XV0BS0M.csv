7199803,5,B00XV0BS0M,"This is the complete American version of the series (which is 6 episodes), the Chinese version is 76 episodes (I believe- it's been a while since I viewed it). But this series, if my sources are correct, is the HBO series for American audiences with added footage of the main character remembering the past events. It was fun to watch again.",1460764800,5,341,4.60655737704918
7199804,4,B00XV0BS0M,Palace intrigues from the East that make the machinations of Western rulers look like children at play. Magnificent production values.,1457222400,,134,5.75
7199805,5,B00XV0BS0M,I loved the story and the costumes in a beautiful feature on dvd!,1445212800,,65,4.076923076923077
7199806,5,B00XV0BS0M,"I love this series! I first came across it on Netflix, and was delighted to find it for sale here on Amazon. Ofc I bought it immediately!

It is a very rich drama series, the costumes and sets are breathtaking. The acting is superb! The subtitles are very well done.
Watching the film in mandarin with the english subtitles definitely gives more feeling and authenticity to the film.

Alot of people have said it is not the complete series, but this is the version I saw on Netflix. I did see the original chinese complete series for sale here on Amazon for those looking for it. This copy though, is still just as wonderful as the original longer version. It is well worth buying!",1445126400,7,681,4.483870967741935
7199807,2,B00XV0BS0M,"As another reviewer points out, this DVD-R is a significant abridgement of the original Chinese television series and thus should be avoided.  Caveat emptor...",1441670400,4,159,5.625

7199809,2,B00XV0BS0M,"This name is misleading.  It is definitely NOT the complete series.  The complete series is 76 hours long and has many subplots and character developments that have been omitted in this shortened version.  It would be really nice to get the original TV series with excellent subtitles, like those found in this version. Two stars, for effort, but I'd like to watch the gorgeous, original, 76-episode series without getting the pounding headache from trying to read and interpret god-awful subtitles.  First world problem, I know, but the series is more addictive than, I don't know, pick something incredibly addictive.",1436140800,22,619,5.222222222222222
7199810,5,B00XV0BS0M,"Superb! Beautiful story and acting, detailing the battle for power between the Imperial Consorts within the Forbidden City during the Quing Dynasty!

8716652,5,B00XV0BS0M,"I first saw this series on NETFLIX and totally enjoyed it. As with any series on Paid for Service provider programs come and go. This is a totally beautifully made series and yes, its in Japanese but the captions work great. after awhile you forget your actually reading the captions and just become involved in the story line. Loved that AMAZON was able to actually provide the DVD set.",1529452800,,387,4.6231884057971016
8716653,1,B00XV0BS0M,"Was really happy when i got this movie in the mail, but was disappointed that loads of eps were cut out to make it shorter. Wasn't happy with my order at all. Really hope i get my refund back...",1526860800,,194,4.0
8716654,3,B00XV0BS0M,The original long series is visually magnificent. I got this shortened version for a friend who may not have the patience to watch the original. The video quality of this 2 disc set is terrible. There is far too much compression.,1524700800,,229,4.609756097560975
8716655,1,B00XV0BS0M,Extremely disappointed!  This was a gift to someone else and I was embarrassed to find out later that the CD was bad.,1505692800,,117,4.318181818181818
8716656,5,B00XV0BS0M,The DVD was to be expected awesome!! I stumbled across this on Netflix And loved it I bought the DVD Netflix took it out the rotation so I had to have it . Best period piece I've seen in a while can't recommend this enough.,1504569600,,223,3.977777777777778
8716657,5,B00XV0BS0M,"Expensive Chinese series very well-done. --In Mandarin (Chinese) tho with subtitles. Beautiful and detailed Costumes and ""life-styles"" of the Court very true to life from what I've gathered over time. (Only thing is that this rendition is a very-encapsulated one of the entire series, but hits its points with enough detail so you don't even miss the entire series!)",1503532800,,366,5.220338983050848
8716658,5,B00XV0BS0M,"I very much like the movie, very clear and understandable but there were some scenes that did not have  English Sub but that's okay because you still would know what they are talking about from the previous and the next scene.  Characters gave justice to the role they were given. From the start to the finish there were no boring moments of this movie.",1473292800,,353,4.5

8716661,5,B00XV0BS0M,Excellent acting by all actors....sad moments at some points...beautiful scenery and the costumes are fabulous. Wished for a more happier ending for the Dowager Empress who went through many trials and tribulations to reach to the top of the anarchy.,1465171200,,250,5.275
