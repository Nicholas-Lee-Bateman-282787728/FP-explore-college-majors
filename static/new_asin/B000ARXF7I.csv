2390491,5,B000ARXF7I,"Mission Hill is probably my favorite animated series of all time.  It succeeds in taking everyday situations and blending in things that couldn't be accomplished with live people and real-world backgrounds.  Set against the colorful backdrop of Mission Hill (based largely on Chicago's Wicker Park neighborhood), this series follows the life of Andy French, a 24-year-old hipster and aspiring cartoonist recently saddled with the family dog (who he's happy to share his home with) and his little brother Kevin (who he's not so happy to share his home with).  Andy's roommates Jim and Posey are there for the hilarity along with his neighbors, co-workers and Kevin's friends from high school whenever the show needs to ""nerd it up.""

This show was a great voice for Generation X.  In the best episode of the short-lived series (""Unemployment, Part II""), Andy's without a job, and perfectly set to laze about at home, cashing his unemployment checks to fuel his malt liquor needs.  In his mind, he's living the lifestyle people of his generation were encouraged to live.  Andy gets kicked in the keister, though, when he finds out that his roommate Jim is leading the complete opposite life, without Andy having any clue.  This kind of real-life insight set the show apart from more slapstick-inspired series like The Simpsons (where Homer seems to lose his job in every episode, which doesn't disrupt the family's life) or Family Guy (where everything seems to work out in the end, no matter what Peter ends up doing).  That isn't to say Mission Hill is melodramatic.  Far from it - this show is one of the funniest I've seen in years.  But it's funny because the viewer is invited to share themselves with the characters.

This is the perfect DVD for fans of the show, and I think each fan should find some friends that didn't get to enjoy Mission Hill during its brief time on the air, and share this show with them.",1134864000,28,1917,4.810975609756097
2390492,5,B000ARXF7I,"A show so good, it HAD to be cancelled.  Makes the Bible look like crap.  Wise beyond its years.  If this show were a dog, it would be the original Lassie.  It's that good!",1134172800,10,172,3.9705882352941178
2390493,5,B000ARXF7I,"This series was truly brilliant, cut short by the WB. Ironically, the WB continues to show mediocre shows while canceling ones such as this. It makes you wonder who the WB's target audience is.

The series was ahead of its time ... on the wrong network, unfortunately. Were it a new series now, it might have been pitched to Comedy Central or Cartoon Network (Adult Swim) and survived not only to _finish_ the first season but for subsequent seasons as well.

The episodes have a slightly higher replay value than most series', a lot of the humor and in fact, some of the best humor is very subtle - such as the No Smoking sign in Jim's office. Moreover, the question everyone always asks is finally answered in the commentary, I am referring of course to the reason all of the characters appear to have Jaundice and yellow teeth. ;)

For ~$20, the two-disc set is well worth it - it would make a great stocking stuffer for anyone with a Kevin or Andy character in his or her own life. :)",1133395200,33,988,4.417582417582418

2390527,5,B000ARXF7I,"Mission Hill is a show obviously crafted with love and care.

2390528,5,B000ARXF7I,"Thought I was buying a mission burrito. Turns out, I was wrong...so wrong! After I ate the 1st disc, I decided to watch the second in my dvd player. It feed my soul with laughter and baby panda tears, yet, I was still hungry.

I used DNA left over from the 1st disc that I recovered from my tongue and reconstructed it using steampunk science (or Punksci for short). I successfully watched the earlier episodes and found a stronger emotional attachment to the characters involved.

Then I got the idea to order out. Tinga in Westfield makes a darn good enchilada.

2390530,5,B000ARXF7I,It is the greatest series I've ever seen. I'm sad that it didn't continue. It encapsulates the greatest fear of all humanity in a first world country: needing to house your younger sibling. The colors are vivid and the humor is spot on of the 1999 to 2000 era.

2390531,5,B000ARXF7I,"If there is any short-lived show that I feel should've had a longer run, it would have to be Mission Hill. Even though it only lasted for a season, this is one of the best animated shows I've ever seen! It a mix of King of the Hill and Friends with nice animation, but the humor is down to earth and never gets too zany or over-the-top. The characters are wonderfully written and there is someone that almost anyone can relate to. While the show is hilarious, it manages to also blend in a small amount of drama as well without it feeling forced or uneven. It really is a treat of a show and if you haven't seen it, go ahead and purchase this set because it is worth it! Maybe if we are lucky, Mission Hill will one day be revived. It's a long shot, but hey a person can dream right?",1395187200,,783,4.090909090909091
2390532,5,B000ARXF7I,"I absolutely adore this series. The humor is awesome, and the characters are great. Seeing a show that's not about a husband and wife with kids, but instead two brothers, and some roommates and the odd people living in the town was a breath of fresh air.

For all the mediocre, even down right horrible series on TV that are renewed year after year, it blows my mind that this one was canceled. Perhaps it was ahead of it's time, as I believe if it came out today, people would be going crazy for it.",1394150400,3,500,4.2631578947368425

2390534,5,B000ARXF7I,This series came out before the adult animation boom of today.  This totally would have been a hit if it came out now.  The show completely captures the late 90s/ early 00s.,1385078400,,173,4.375

It has subtle differences that you catch on to when you compare it to other animated shows. I really liked the characters as well. Overall the show is definitely in my top ten. The first time I saw the show was quite a while back so it makes me feel nostalgic to watch it after forgetting about it for a while. I would most certainly recommend it to anyone who likes animated comedy shows.",1327363200,,562,4.165137614678899

The dvds work great - no skipping or off-dialogue or anything.",1297036800,,462,3.925531914893617
2390553,5,B000ARXF7I,"I used to watch these on the Cartoon Network at one or two in the morning.  I have to wonder why this series never survived.  It only ran for 13 episodes!  The characters are much more distinct and real than in Family Guy or The Simpsons.  There would be consequenses to the characters actions. Much more in tune with real life and it's irony than the surreal humor of Family Guy.  The older brother/younger brother relationship;especially with the both of them 1000 miles away from home, makes for an interesting series. There was a comic book long ago called ""unsupervised existance"" and I have to wonder if that was the inspiration behind this series.

If you never saw any of these episodes before, you are in for a treat because it has all the adult humor of Family Guy without the dance routines.  It's the nature of city life and neighbors in the apartment complex that made this show work.  I wish that someone would put this show back on the air again.",1296864000,2,961,4.514450867052023

2390558,5,B000ARXF7I,"I watch many animated, comedic shows such as King of the Hill (my second favorite), Family Guy, Home Movies, the Simpsons, etc. Although there are not that many episodes of Mission Hill, the character development is unprecedented. In fact, every single character in the show is unforgettable. After the first few minutes of the first episode, I was obsessed. Also, the artwork is simply amazing. I read somewhere that Mission Hill was the last animated show to be done completely in paint (or something like that). All things considered, Mission Hill is without a doubt the best show I have ever seen. If I ever get rich, the first thing on my list of things to do is to pay the writing staff to make more episodes.

The show itself thrives off of its brilliant, mundane, situational humor. In fact, the show is so mundane that you almost feel like you are living in Mission Hill and become Andy's roommate. Every time something bad happens you'll either think to yourself ""Wow! That's my life,"" or ""Thank God my life isn't as bad as his."" Andy is the typical twenty-something year old living on his own and not caring at all about his budget or anything for that matter. He loves drinking, eating Bugels, and watching famous puke scenes from movies. I find that he is the most unforgettable character out of any series that I have ever seen. He basically gets stuck ""babysitting"" his teenage brother Kevin, who is probably the biggest nerd ever. While Andy isn't the brightest bulb in the crayon box, he knows a lot about the world. He almost never gets a break from life. His roommate Jim is, to say the least, hilarious. I can't even begin to describe him; you will just have to see for yourself if you haven't already. You will love him from the moment you see him. Posey is basically a typical hippie. She is a very slow, absent-minded individual who enjoys meditating and gardening. Andy also has several neighbors in his apartment complex. Gus and Wally are a gay couple that live in the apartments and are friends with Andy. Gus runs a diner, and Wally works at the movie theater. Even if you are homophobic, you are pretty much forced to love them. Carlos, Natalie, and their baby are also neighbors of Andy. They are major hippies and animal rights activists. Carlos is a painter and somewhat of a hypocrite. I don't think the writers ever reveal what Natalie does however. Andy's dog, Stogie, is also a pretty funny addition to the cast of characters. He can't talk like Brian in Family Guy, but put a dog on a whole bunch of drugs and you get Stogie. That's the only way I can describe him.

The only real con to the DVD box set is that one of the episodes has messed up audio. It is the episode with the ""nerd"" convention where George's sister comes to town, and Andy and Kevin are fighting over her. The voices are softer than the sound effects (ex: slamming a door). If you have surround sound hooked up, then this will probably really bother you. I personally was not too bothered by this. It is somewhat bad, but I think it gets a little better as the episode progresses. This is the only episode where this is a problem though. All the other episodes have really good audio. For this one episode, just turn the TV volume up a little more to hear the dialogue and tune out the ambient noises.

Overview:
Pros-
1) Remarkable character development
2) The plots of the episodes are really good.
3) The series is hilarous.
4) Artwork is very enticing.
5) You will most likely be able to relate to the characters and feel at home in their environment.
6) The theme song is an edited version of ""Italian Leather Sofa"" by Cake, and Cake is an awesome band.

Cons-
1) The audio is messed up in one episode.",1261958400,6,3715,4.507418397626113

If only the studio could do a Ghost World animated film :(... but anyway, the episodes are pretty funny and offer some pretty good choices. Sometimes, this show's a filler on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim, which is where I got into it a few years back. I like the cast of characters immensely.
That said, I can't 5 star this because the production of the DVD's seems like a common problem these days: unfinished and/or poor surfacing during the production. Both of my discs arrived and most of the episodes play fine, but due to a faint semi circle error on each disc, I had to get them resurfaced to watch an episode on each disc, and crappy disc production should be a factor on reviewing any DVD.",1251158400,2,804,4.551724137931035

The characters were diverse and comical. The writing was topical and witty, yet in an open-ended fashion that could apply to any point in the post-modern era.  Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein definitely had their fingers on the pulse of young America. Mission Hill is a wacky, yet poignant, look at a group of young people trying to survive in the chaos of the big city while never losing site of their pursuit of fun.

I simply cannot believe Adult Swim isn't actively pursuing the resurrection of this gem. I am galled that we viewers are subjected to such garbage as Saul of the Molemen and the Tim and Eric Awesome Show. (Sorry guys, but it's not a great job!) We're forced to lose a toon I personally could watch endlessly in re-runs, and in turn suffer an endless stream of bizarre and dull crap.

2390570,4,B000ARXF7I,"Mission Hill has long been one of my favorite animated series, and I was extremely excited when I found out that it was being released on DVD.  The writing is great, the animation is visually exciting, and the voice work is well done.  It's a shame that this show's life was cut short, as I feel that it was just getting into it's stride towards the end of it's production.

There's only one thing that has prevented me from giving this DVD set the five stars that it deserves.  On the episode ""Andy and Kevin Make a Friend (or One Bang for Two Brothers)"" it seems that the audio tracks are reversed.  The character's voices are at a low volume, while background noises and sound effects are louder than they need to be.  I thought maybe that my television or DVD player was at fault, so I tried it on a different set, but the same problem occurred.  I exchanged my copy at the store it was purchased at, only to find out that the new DVD set had the same error.  I've tried a couple of times to get assistance directly from Warner Home Video (Most recently as of August 2008), but even after receiving two different replacement copies, the error still remains.  I'm afraid that it affected the entire run of the set's production, and they haven't fixed it since the first press over three years ago.  Maybe I'm nit-picking, but the episode is almost unwatchable due to this oversight.  Sure, you could just turn your volume up so the voices are louder, but then every sound effect that occurs runs the risk of blowing out your speakers.

So, if you're a fan of the show, I recommend buying this set.  But keep in mind that you will probably have to avoid the entire aforementioned episode, as I'm willing to bet that every copy of this DVD has the issue, and Warner Home Video doesn't seem to care about fixing it.",1220054400,3,1815,4.414414414414415

The show is just so funny, not like out right bada-bing jokes, but somewhat dry, intelligent funny.. that's why I love it. I even did a faux resume on Andy French for this college class (yes, a real professor, in a real college, made us write a resume on an animated character..)You just have to watch this and you will love it and all it's details and outlook on daily life.

2390576,5,B000ARXF7I,"When it comes to the short-lived cartoon series, ""Mission Hill"", I have to admit I'm a bit of a novice. I never caught it in its original WB network run and I only saw it once (the ""Unemployment Part 2"" episode) on Cartoon Network's ""Adult Swim"". But that one episode grabbed my imagination and tickled my funny bone enough for me to invest some hard earned sheckles into buying this two CD set, ""Mission Hill~The Complete Series"".

Now, here is the capper. Not knowing much about the series, I started watching the show with my six year old son. Yes, I can just imagine your shaking your head right now and the sound effect of ""Tut-tut"" is leaving your lips. I realize that there is some graphic ""pushing the envelope"" material shown and implied in the series and it isn't exactly something you would find on ""SpongeBob Square Pants"". I had some cringe induced reservations while watching the ""Pilot"" episode with him. But you know what? That stuff sort of just passed over my son's head. What really got his attention was the same stuff I liked. This included the show's bold (and colorful) graphic style, witty, satiric humor (which made fun of everything and anything) and the catchy, indie-style theme music.

For those of you who don't know, the animated series looks at urban life in the somewhat pre-gentrified, city neighborhood of ""Mission Hill"". It features a close group of 'Gen-X' roommates and centers on two brothers. This includes 'slacker', Andy French (Voice of Wally Langham) and his younger, super-geeky brother from the suburbs, Kevin French (voice of Scott Mellville). To say these two are polar opposites is an understatement. Like most real-life brothers, they both seem to take perverse pleasure in criticizing and torturing each other. Sometimes this leads to comically rolling around on the floor attempting to kill each other. But don't worry, at the end of the day, these two look out for each other.

The other roommates include the Buddah-like, bohemian wise-guy, Jim Kuback (Brian Poshn) and the spacey, holistic masseuse, Posey Tyler (Vicki Lewis). The show also features the kind of interesting characters you find in many urban neighborhoods including a multi-cultural activist/artist family and a hilarious, older gay couple (a mix of David Niven & Broderick Crawford) who run the local diner.

These and other characters support the brothers in their various animated adventures and situations. Like the 'Simpsons' (which this show's creators wrote for), 'Mission Hill' seems to have the ability to make fun of everything with both wit, intelligence and most of all heart. This is a great show with well rounded characters and hilarious plotlines that takes chances. Its a shame that the series was so short-lived. It would have been interesting to see the further adventures of Andy, Kevin and the rest of the gang. Highly recommended!",1203638400,3,2873,5.00418410041841
2390577,5,B000ARXF7I,"Mission Hill hits my sweet spot.

This is more an exploration of passing into adulthood than situation comedy. Andy and his little brother are both stuck in the place between childhood and adult hood. A sweet place to be. A point in life where we are optamistic about the future, I want to be a cartoonist, I want to go to an ivy league collage, but we get stuck in the quagmire that is day to day life. Do we write a resume or get trashed with the hot chick down the street?

I love the mocking tones against Mtv. Mtv has no substance. Then they pose the question, what if you were offered a spot on Mtv? Would you turn it down? Hell no is the answer.

The crappy job with a sleazy boss. Then you become the boss.

anyway I could go on. If this sounds like the show that scratches you where you itch then you must have it. It will validate your existance. But if your one of ""them"" pretend you never saw it and keep walking...",1187827200,,927,4.104972375690608

2390579,5,B000ARXF7I,"Welcome to Mission Hill...possibly one of the greatest 'cartoons' ever made.  It's quite a tragedy that it only lasted one season. Both discs have been sitting in my dvd player for weeks and I just can't stop watching it. Situational comedies like this are the greatest because you get to watch characters evolve and 'grow-up,' so-to-speak, despite the fact it's an animated show and that it could quite literally never grow any of the characters up at all to retain the demographic the show was aimed at portraying (of which they do brilliantly).

Mission Hill chronicles the lives of the French brothers and their wacky roomies and neighbors of their tenant building in Mission Hill (which, according to the creators' commentary, is based on the Wicker Park community in Chicago). Although the show originally aired in 2000 (i think) on the WB (young teen girl's network...bad place for this show, hence the cancellation) it does a great job of poking fun at the pop culture of today. I find myself able to empathize with Andy French, the main character of the show, who is a 24 year-old wannabe cartoonist (like me, only I'm a 3D artist) working at a water bed store that has to take on Kevin, his younger 17 year old brother, as a roomie so that Kevin can continue to go to school in the area in the event of his parents moving to another state . Ensuing are many great comedic moments between the rival siblings and the ensuing adventures of their roommates and neighbors, which are interwoven so well in the show.

As other reviewers have noted, there are audio 'problems' throughout some episodes simply because of rights issues with songs. In the episode 'Unemployment Part 1' there is a moment where it even appears that music was used to cover up some dialog, for reasons to me unknown (never saw this episode on TV...put it back on Adult Swim!). All other music missing or replaced is a simple case of not being able to get rights to use it on the DVD because the studio didn't want to pay for the royalties, I'm guessing. Damn those music labels and their greed...anywho, it's a small price to pay to have a fantastic show like this on hand to watch whenever you feel like some quality TV viewing.

I can only hope that enough people buy this DVD set to produce enough interest from Paramount to restart production of this show and bring back all the fantastic people involved in making this show what it was. If a crappy show like Family Guy can come back from the dead, surely a genius show like this can...though I fear it will not happen.",1168992000,2,2554,4.594298245614035

2390582,5,B000ARXF7I,"The management at Adult Swim (or any other network) should seriously consider bringing Mission Hill back from the dead.  I began watching this show 2 weeks ago before Pee-Wee came on Adult Swim when it was nestled between Futurama and Family Guy.  At first, I bypassed it every time it came on, thinking it was retarded or something along the lines of Home Movies.

The addiction began.  I decided to watch some of it while waiting for Family Guy because nothing else was on.  Then I began watching it every night, looking forward to each episode like crazy.  The characters are hilarious, the stories sensational, and the approach for each episode is amazing!

I can't get enough of Mission Hill.  It is definitely a smart, clever show that was seriously underrated.  If any show deserves a chance of coming back now, it is this one.  Adult Swim should at least consider the possibility of picking up the show and seeing if production can begin once again.

If you really love Mission Hill, try recording the series onto DVD for yourself when it airs on Adult Swim, at least the episodes there are not edited and the episode with the bad voice track audio on the DVD set is not messed up on the original airing.  If you don't have a DVD recorder then for the sake of the episode ""Andy and Kevin Make a Friend (or One Bang for Two Brothers)"" I would at least record it onto VHS so you can hear it perfectly without having to turn the volume up all the way.  The bonus features are pretty cool though but for me that the only good thing.  While the episodes are still good on this, if you don't mind changes to music then go for this set, however as I said for one of the episode, damaged voice audio so be careful.",1145836800,55,1235,3.908366533864542

On the other hand, if you loved the show, this DVD might make you sad, as you realise that after about 12 hours, it's over.  That's it.  No more Mission Hill.

This was a very well-done series, I loved the use of color and the more mature themes (definitely worked on Adult Swim) that this animation encompasses.  I find myself silently thinking BLINGBLONGBLINGBLONG sometimes at work even.  However well done the series is, it is also very short-lived.  I am not sure if it is worth the nearly $30, since a rabid fan would consume it in 2 days at most.

You might be better off looking it up on Netflix than buying it, but ultimately if you support it with your $$, they may be inspired to make more of them.  Just not sure where that audience is right now . . .",1143072000,5,977,4.176470588235294

I can relate to several of the adventures in this show. Bought the DVD and absolutely loved it. It's sad how they only made 13 episodes. A show like this could have had many successful seasons. The shows that get 6+ seasons are over rated shows like family Guy and The Simpsons. And nether of those shows are funny any more. But anyways, all of the characters in this cartoon are interesting and have their own essence about themselves. Andy: Slacker, cool hipster, enjoy parties and liquor. Kevin: Nerdy, Intelligent, Drives Andy crazy. Jim: Laid-back, slow talking, always eating. Posey: Hippie-type, plant loving, sort of a space cadet. Stoogie: Andy's dog, eats constantly, drinks discarded liquor, dumb. Wally: Gus's lover. Gus: Wally's lover. There are many more but these are the most prominent in the show.

2390595,4,B000ARXF7I,"Mission Hill is an excellent show and if this is the best way for you to see it, buy the discs.  I have to make one warning, though: the background music was switched out for inferior generic music in many scenes.

Ron doesn't get to play Blue Monday at his party.

The strip club loses a lot of energy, with wimpier background music and lap dance music this is much less cool (and less hilarious).

The planatarium narration ""First there was the Milky Way, then there was the Crab Nebula, then there was Judas Priest!"" gets cut off and inferior music is used.

Kevin no longer gets to nerd up the Ferraro with Gordon Lightfoot.  I believe some instrumental music (Scott Joplin?) is used instead.

Kevin's tie loses its ridiculous ""9 to 5"" by Dolly Parton, and it's replaced something like a Christmas jingle.  (I think Jim's music cigarette also gets changed to the same song.)

There's no more Wackety Sax (sp?) when Kevin is swimming after the college recommedation from Wierdie's dead dad.

Worst of all, the wonderfully funny use of REM's ""Everybody Hurts"" as a ""Real World: Mission Hill"" castmember is hauled away in an ambulance is replaced with ambient filler on the DVD.  When the cast of neighbors starts singing REM's song at the end, the DVD version gives you no reason for why they would choose the song, taking the joke away.

Anyway, this is from distant memory from the last time I watched the set, so I might have missed a few other changes.  One exception is that I think the song from Run Lola Run stayed intact.

This music issue was the only problem with the DVDs for me.  Everything else was first rate, and it's a gem of a show.  The slight reduction in depth from the music changes might not bother anyone who's not famailiar with the show, and I believe you don't have to be gen-X to like it, because it has all the cartoon fundamentals (...that I can make up on the spot): signature style, full use of color, background detail, character development, and natural dialogue.
