8294783,5,B001DSR8OE,"This is a terrific performance of the Missa Solemnis, a towering masterpiece of the choral repertoire. In contrast with the Karajan / BPO DVD version, Bernstein utilises a  smaller choir and the filming quality on this version is far superior. The four soloists are uniformly excellent, the chorus negotiates Beethoven's extremely difficult writing with aplomb and the Conzertgebouw Orchestra play like angels. Bernstein takes the music at a briskish pace; he keeps this massive work together with great success. I have heard the sound recording of what I presume is the same performance; the visual experience greatly increases the appreciation of the work and is definitely to be preferred.

The couplings - Choral Fantasia and Creatures of Prometheus - are additionally well performed. These are however minor Beethoven compositions and pale beside the greatness of the Missa Solemnis. Good sound for all three compositions.",1279065600,8,927,5.430555555555555
8294784,5,B001DSR8OE,"The DVD recording of Bernstein's Missa Solemnis, as always very well directed by Humphrey Burton, captures concerts in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw in February and March 1978. The generous filler works, minor but thoroughly enjoyable Beethoven, were recorded in Vienna in 1978 (Prometheus) and 1985 (Choral Fantasy) respectively. We can thank the heavens that we have so many documents, both visual and acoustic, from Bernstein's incredibly productive period in the 1970s and 1980s, then at the peak of his career as a musician, and of his highly felicitous collaboration with the Vienna Philharmonic. His Missa Solemnis is exceptionally clear, transparent and, at the same time, both monumental and sublime. Supported by the four absolutely outstanding soloists and the most refined playing from the Concertgebouw Orchestra and equally fine singing from the Radio Hilversum Chorus, this is a great performance that has stood the test of time already in its CD version and is even more welcome in the DVD format. Shame on DG for not crediting the superb concertmaster Herman Krebbers for his heavenly solo in the Benedictus in the DVD notes. The Prometheus excerpts are delivered with much gusto and panache by the conductor and orchestra alike, in the Choral Fantasy the piano soloist Homero Francesch displays brilliance and tact when he brings off some of Beethoven's more banal inventions very convincingly. It appears that this DVD is out of print. If you can still find it, grab it!",1243814400,11,1487,5.2259414225941425
8294785,5,B001DSR8OE,"I bought this for the choral fantasy, and to tell the truth I rarely listen to the Missa.  I happened to buy either the Bernstein version or some other version without realizing I already had one version.  When I played them side by side, the difference is astonishing.  The musicality, the precision, the enunciation of the chorus is phenomenal in the Bernstein version -- an electric performance.  My other version (by whom, I don't recall -- my entire collection was stolen when I got burglarized) seemed muddy, uninspired.  Go for this one.",1228262400,7,544,4.869565217391305
