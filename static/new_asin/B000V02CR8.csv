8215988,4,B000V02CR8,"There's not much I can add to what the previous reviewers have said.  This DVD is very informative on the traditions, ceremonies, and duties that the Queen fulfills as a monarch.  It shows how much difference there is between what the British Prime Minister fulfills in his/her duties from the more traditional and ceremonial ones of that of the Queen.  If the Queen had to run the Commonwealth as well as be the ceremonial figurehead, she would get no sleep whatsoever!

I would have liked to have seen more of the color film coverage of the coronation in 1953.  Years ago, I remember that there was a VHS release of that film, but didn't get a copy then.  Does anyone know if the coronation color film in its entirety was ever released on DVD and if that is still in print?<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Days-of-Majesty-Queen-Elizabeth-II/dp/B000V02CR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Days of Majesty / Queen Elizabeth II</a>",1283040000,5,961,5.373333333333333
8215989,4,B000V02CR8,This interesting and informative DVD will educate you on the role and ceremonial duties of the Queen. For better understanding of a constitutional monarchy and the part in which the royal family particularly the Queen this is a must see. The video shows the Queen does not just sit on a throne and wear a crown and does not have any official role in governing but its not just all diamonds and tiaras.,1271203200,2,401,4.506849315068493
8215990,4,B000V02CR8,"While this is not the most comprehensive video on the Queen, it is a most pleasant documentary, not only about Her Majesty but about many of the traditions surrounding the monarchy.  I agree with another reviewer that the coronation footage is amazing in its restoration.

An inexpensive addition, most welcome, to my DVD library.",1228780800,16,330,5.092592592592593
8215991,5,B000V02CR8,"I received this DVD as a gift and it was very well appeciated by me.  The footage of the coronation rehearsals with the Duchess of Norfolk are amazing - surely some of the most extraordinary footage ever filmed.  The Duchess of Norfolk of the time did not convert to Catholicism therefore she could stand in for The Queen.

See also the book ""Coronation June 2 1953"" by Conrad Frost (ISBN 0 213 16674 7) for a COMPLETE background to the lead-up, rehearsals, snafus, and ""insider"" revelations attendant upon the greatest coronation we are going to see in our lifetimes.

I found the reviews by the other two reviewers to be superficial and to review such an important DVD in one sentence just reeks of laziness and superciliousness.  Surely that reviewer had more to say - but then maybe he did not.

This is an astounding DVD and has such chapter headings as:  The Trial of the Pyx; Swan Upping; Lord Lieutenants; The Royal Standard; The Royal Maundy Service; Colour Drills; The Royal Company of Archers; etc., etc.

It is a treasure-trove for gleaners of royal trivia and admirers of the House of Mountbatten-Windsor alike.

Highly recommended to all monarchist and lovers of pomp and pageantry.

8215992,5,B000V02CR8,"I am so glad this is on DVD.  I taped it off of my local PBS station during the year commemorating the 45th aniversary of Queen Elizabeth's coronation.  It was fascinating to see everything that went on during the wweks leading up to the coronation, like the women who embroidered the train that the Queen wore when she first entered Westminster Abbey.  I love this DVD and am happy to have it once again in my royal library.",1198108800,31,425,4.423076923076923
