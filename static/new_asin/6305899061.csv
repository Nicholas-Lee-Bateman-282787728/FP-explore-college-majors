7897331,3,6305899061,"When I was in grad school, an older student asked me and a Caucasian colleague what his background was.  We said Eurasian.  He replied, ""I look like I have just one Chinese parents, but I actually have two.""  He then went on to say that he saw a documentary about mummies in China that had European features.  He recalled, ""Those must be my ancestors!""  I wonder if he were speaking about this documentary.
This may have been the first doc to speak about this subject, but I know others now exist.  The first clue may be hair color, but then they speak about fabrics and DNA which suggests these mummies were of Europeans.  These finds point to interactions way before Marco Polo.  Some of the mummies were approximately 4,000 years old.
The work may frustrate some as it never fully answers why the people were there and how they got there.  I liked this work better than a more recent doc that asks if Amazonian women still exist and looks at the DNA of one blonde, Mongolian girl.  I wonder if viewers may like to watch this alongside reading ""They Came Before Columbus"" which suggests some Africans may have made it to the Americas.
The doc ends with a praise of mixing that challenges the statements of Rudyard Kipling.  In academia, there's a relatively new field called Whiteness Studies.  Perhaps this doc can be shown in a lecture on that subject.  I wonder if some interested in this topic may also like to see recent docs about the fate of the Neanderthals.",1387843200,,1468,4.557251908396947
