7959556,3,B000063K13,It's a bad movie that I just love.  One of the stranger sci-fi fantasy films made has it's own charm.  Gordon Mitchell rocks!,1405468800,,125,4.391304347826087
7959557,4,B000063K13,"I remembered seeing this one way back when, and I thought then that it was one of the most strange and different kind of these movies I'v ever seen. A cross between  Sci FI and Sword and sandal  sort of Movie, And it is in Widescreen too, Although the Color is kind of faded, and the Picture is not the best , If you like these kind of movies at  all ,then I think you will want this one, A little bit of sometthing for everyone in this movie",1357430400,,442,3.943820224719101
7959558,4,B000063K13,"Muscleman Movies, Sword and Sandal, Peplum, whatever you choose to call them, no one made them better or pumped out more of them than the Italians did during the period from the late '50's to the mid 60's.

This once very popular genre - which still has a huge cult following - is yet to receive proper home video distribution. It's next to impossible trying to find decent quality versions of the films; mostly they're available in budget sets and the prints are choppy, with washed out color and not formatted in their correct aspect ratio. A few companies have to be applauded for trying to do it right, like Retromedia with their version of THE GIANT OF METROPOLIS (1961).

To say this movie is a departure from its genre would be a gigantic understatement. GIANT OF METROPOLIS is peplum pulp turned upside down and spun around. Set in  20,000 B.C.(!), a race of maniacal masterminds are tampering with climate control which threatens their own existence. Our muscle-bound hero (Gordon Mitchell) is pitted against monsters, gladiators and torture devices before he can save the buxom princess (Bella Cortez) and himself from the impending destruction of Metropolis.

Sure, the sci-fi/sword and sandal premise is outrageous, but that's the whole point of why this movie's appeal is so irresistible. At first, the combination of advanced and ancient cultures appears to clash, but gradually they merge until you're not quite sure just when this all takes place. The relentlessly repetitious music score only adds to the bizarre mix, and the whole thing works in an entertaining, weird sort of way that has to be seen to be believed. Although GIANT OF METROPOLIS has nothing to do with Fritz Lang's 1927 futuristic classic, I can't help seeing some homage being paid to it in GIANT's cataclysmic, flood-filled finale. In fact, it's even MORE devastating here than in Lang's film!

The print used for this DVD has some wear and the color is a little off at times, but it's sharp and presented in its correct widescreen format. The extras include an interview with Gordon Mitchell, a Gladiator Trailer Collection, stills gallery, and a short clip, ""Goliath and the Cheerleaders"", with Mitchell.

If you're into this kind of film, THE GIANT OF METROPOLIS is one that grows on you and gets better on repeated viewings. Definitely a cult-curio that doesn't disappoint.",1320278400,,2364,4.957070707070707
7959559,3,B000063K13,"Giant of Metropolis features one of the better stars from the sword and sandal genre,Gordon Mitchell a.k.a Mitchell Gordon and in this flick he gets to actually act. He does a lot better than you would expect. The Metropolis of the title appears to be the capitol of fabled Atlantis and this movie combines science fiction with sword and sandal action as the ruler of Atlantis is using dark sciences to try and create a race of supermen. Some of the sets and costumes look like they could have been borrowed from the old Buster Crabbe Flash Gordon serials,but that's not a bad thing. Sexy Bella Cortez is the heroine here,but she has little to do other than perform a Vegas-styled dance number with two men dressed like they just came from an ""artists and models ball"".That and cry on cue. This movie's big fault is in it's pacing. It really drags in places,but Mitchell is in his physical prime here and looks great in his scenes in the arena. If you're a fan of this genre you should check it out. Anyone else should save their money.",1267056000,,1036,4.51595744680851
7959560,5,B000063K13,"Don't miss this one if you are a peplum/sword and sandal fan.  Don't miss this one if you are a sci-fi fan.  The Giant Of Metropolis is a lost classic which is finally receiving its overdue recognition.  An incredibly unique and atmospheric experience, which deftly mixes the 60's Italian peplum format with a ""future-city-in-the-past"" sci-fi format.  This singular combination is probably why this movie has remained so obscure--peplum fans didn't get it; sci-fi fans never heard of it.

  Coming late in his career, The Giant Of Metropolis was perhaps director Umberto Scarpelli's greatest achievement.  The uninformed could easily mistake his work here for a Mario Bava Creation.  Brooding, epic set design, dynamic camera angles, and eccentric costumes are a tribute to his style.  This is a film which reveals new secrets on repeat viewings.  Watch for the anatomical artwork in the background, the anesthetized people in the alcoves, and the gigantic, nude Atlas in the plaza.  The sets are so huge, in fact, they must have consumed several sound stages.  That, and several excellent matte paintings, reflect the generous budget available.  On-location shots are integrated well.

Special effects, though not exactly ""Irwin Allen"" are intense, particularly the finale.

  The plot operates on several levels:  Love, ugenics, sadism, science vs. nature, beefcake, immortality, spiritualism, and sexuality.

Rich characters abound.  Gordon Mitchell, as Obro, is at his physical peak:  handsome and defined.  His acting has also improved since Atlas In The Land Of The Cyclops.  Yotar (played by Roldano Lupi) is intimidating as the megalomaniac king/scientist.  Elmous (played by ""Marietto"") is charming and sweet.  His plaintive weeping when his father, Yotar, leaves him isolated in a stark area of the palace is heartbreaking.  Mercedai, Yotar's daughter, and Egan, who Yotar returns to life, are also worth mentioning.  However, my personal favorite is Queen Texen, played by Llana Orfei.  Her scenes are tense and riveting.  Don't miss her backing down the steps from Yotar.  The voice artist who dubbed the English seems to have captured the emotion of the actress perfectly.

  The Retromedia DVD is very good, presented in widescreen and has plenty of extras.  Unlike other reviewers, my copy has no defect on either side.  If you like this movie as much as I do, get the Incredibly Strange Filmworks VHS version too.  (Yes, VHS.)  It's not widescreen, and the color is weak, but, unlike the DVD, the dubbing is IN SYNCH throughout the movie.  The image is very clean also.

  By the way, some sources have tried to portray this film as some kind of sequel to Fritz Lang's 1927 silent classic, Metropolis.  The two films are in no way related.

  One more note:  The music score by Armando Trovaioli is hauntingly melancholy and original.  Although used over and over, it only adds to the stand-alone quality of this unique film.

7959561,3,B000063K13,"At the city of Metropolis from Atlantis, the mad King Yotar (Roldano Lupi) is perpetrating some sinister and weird experiments to dominate the secrets of nature, among them is the brain transplant from his wise old father Egon (Furio Meniconi) to the poor boy Elmos (Marietto), the Yotar's son, in order to get Elmos' inmortality. The he-man Obro (Gordon Mitchell) arrives in Metropolis to prevent and save the city from destruction, but from the very beginning is captured by the magnetic rays trap, so our hero is tortured and clashed with a wild giant, a bunch of fearsome dwarves, etc. But Yotar's family does not approve of the insane experiments and a servant of the Queen (Liana Orfei) helps Obro to get free and takes him to the secret cave of the giant, because a movable foot of Atlas' big statue opens the entrance of the cave. After Princess Mercede (Bella Cortez) the Yotar's daughter, will fall in love with Obro and...

7959563,3,B000063K13,"Absurd plots, miniscule budgets, wooden acting, asinine plots, badly synced dialog, beefcake up the ying yang, and busty maidens...in case you're not familiar, these are all cinematic indicators you've stepped into what's commonly known as a `Sword and Sandals' picture, a European (mainly Italian) genre made popular in the late 1950s (with the 1958 release of Hercules, featuring muscle man Steve Reeves) that ran through the mid to late 1960s.  Among the brawny bodybuilders to follow Reeves to the `Promised Land' were Reg Park (Hercules and the Captive Women), Gordon Scott (Goliath and the Vampires), and Charles Allen Pendleton, better known as Gordon Mitchell, who appears in this film, titled Il Gigante di Metropolis also known as The Giant of Metropolis, originally released in 1961 and ported to American shores sometime in 1963.  Co-written and directed by Umberto Scarpelli (David and Goliath, Fury of the Pagans), with the English dub directed by Richard McNamara (Mill of the Stone Women, Goliath Against the Giants), the film features, as I've mentioned, Gordon Mitchell (Atlas Against the Cyclops, The Centurion), who flourished in the Italian cinema even after the genre had come and gone, appearing in a slew of spaghetti westerns and horror films, among others...also appearing is Bella Cortez (Vulcan, Son of Jupiter), Roldano Lupi (Women of Devil's Island), Liana Orfei (Hercules in the Valley of Woe), Furio Meniconi (Goliath and the Barbarians), and Marietto (Till the End of the World) as Elmos, spindly son of the evil King Yotar.

The film starts out with some scrolling text stating the year is 20,000 B.C., and we're somewhere on the continent of Atlantis...it appears a highly scientifically advanced city named Metropolis is swathed in its own hubris to the point where it begins meddling with forces man was never meant to dabble in (cheating death), and Obro (Mitchell), a man of `gigantie strength and courage', along with his father and brothers, have made a great trek to warn King Yotar (Lupi) of the disaster soon to be wrought for their arrogance (as we all know from those old Chiffon Margarine commercials, ""It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature"").  After some rather odd events, Obro ends up alone, captured, and brought before King Yotar amidst his fabulous modern city.  Obro issues his warning, to which he's pitted against a hairy giant (giant meaning the guy was about a foot taller than Mitchell), a slew of bitey pygmies (pygmies meaning they were all about a foot shorter than Mitchell), and subjected to any number of bizarre tortures, including (but not limited to) scalding, freeze, and brain scrambling rays.  Seems King Yotar latest quest involves granting immortal life to his son, Elmos, along with instilling Yotar's father's mind into the boy (a lot of this didn't make sense), despite protests from the bountiful Queen Texen (Orfei) and Yotar's daughter from his first marriage, the babalicious Princess Mecede (Cortez)...homina homina...anyway, Obro manages to escape his prison, assisted by those in Metropolis who think Yotar has gone too far, and wage a battle against the king and his minions in an effort to save Metropolis from itself (seems cosmic forces have aligned in such a way as to induce an impending volcanic eruption, or some such nonsense).

Can you say convoluted?  Seriously, as far as what I've related it's only the tip of the iceberg, as there seems to be plots from like three or four different films here.  Subsequently, the film drags terribly during its 92 minute running time.  I could have weathered this movie much better had the pacing been a bit more consistent, but it is what it is...funny thing is while Mitchell is supposed to be the star, you'd hardly know it from watching the first 40 minutes as we become so involved with King Yothar, his machinations, along with his extended family, including his wife, son, daughter, father, and so on...I have to say, both his wife and daughter were extremely easy on the eyes....hotchie mamas!  As far as Mitchell goes, the guy's got a face akin to a well-worn piece of leather, but he did sport quite a sinewy, manly physique.  There are a number of prerequisite action scenes, some shot well, some not (my favorite is when the hero is swarmed by a number of attackers, only to throw them off in one, massive heave), along with some really shoddy special effects.  One aspect that I did find quite impressive was the interior sets for the city of Metropolis.  Someone obviously put a lot of work into this, and it showed.  And then there are the costumes, specifically those worn by the scientists and such within the city of Metropolis.  These looked almost exactly like those worn by the mutated humans living underground in the film Beneath the Planet of the Apes (1970)...flowing, futuristic robes made from the finest crushed cotton upholstery found normally in upscale automobiles.  I did like the musical score, but given the same bit of music was used 856 times, it did tend to wear on my ears.  I soon found something to distract me from this aspect in that about three quarters the way into the film, the dubbing goes quite a bit out of sync.  I don't know what happened here, but it was kinda funny.  All in all this ain't a bad entry into the genre (I've seen better), just a bit overly long and a tad too convoluted from what I'd normally expect from my Sword and Sandal flicks (to be fair, they all pretty much feature outrageous plots, this one just seemed to have more than was necessary).

Prior to the film actually starting, Retromedia includes a disclaimer stating something along the lines that the material on this DVD was mastered from the best available surviving elements, which essentially means it picture quality is going to be rough...and it is...the film is presented in widescreen (1.85:1) format, but it appears it may not have been centered properly, as the edge of the film is present on the right side of the screen.  I'm certainly no expert in DVD coding, so this may be something other than what I think it is...the picture itself is full of blemishes and such, and there are a few frames missing.  Given the rarity of the film, perhaps this is the best that was available, and I doubt Retromedia would drop extensive coin for a full-blown restoration, but I've seen other companies release rare finds with much better quality (how is it Something Weird Video always seems to find high quality elements for their transfers?).  As far as the audio, it's decent enough, slightly better than the picture, if you don't mind the occasional drop out.  There are a number of extras included like a still gallery, a short sample of the Italian language version of the film, a Gordon Mitchell interview (6:06), a bit featuring Mitchell titled Goliath and the Cheerleaders from the Fred Olen Ray film Bikini Drive-In (1995), along with a number of trailers including one for this film, along with ones for Goliath and the Vampires (1961), Goliath and the Dragon (1960), Goliath and the Sins of Babylon (1963), Samson and the Seven Miracles of the World (1961), and The Witch's Curse (1962).

7959564,2,B000063K13,"As much as I am a fan of Gordon Mitchell and Italian B-movies, it took me four tries to make it all the way through this dull and poorly presented movie.  The movie itself is extremely cheesy, complete with dubbing that is poorly synced and often is incongruous with what is happening on screen.  At one point a male servant dies in a battle, and afterward there is a scene where the bad guys find his corpse and say, ""we found the body of one of the queen's slave girls(!)"".  There's some good fight scenes, some mostly stupid looking miniature special effects, but not enough of either to relieve the intense boredom of the overall film.
The DVD presentation doesn't help things any either.  I find it impossible to believe that this was the best print left in all existence.  It is extremely grainy, washed-out, and just plain bad-looking.  The image is windowboxed since the sides of the screen look to be damages from the film being exposed to some sort of chemical build-up on one side.  On the whole, it looks like it was left out in the sun for an extended period of time, with the only colors left being mostly ugly faded blues and browns.  On top of this, the sound is out of sync which makes the dubbing look even worse than usual. Almost every sound comes about .5 seconds after the event takes place visually.
If they weren't going to go through the trouble of restoring a film, why bother putting it on DVD in favor of some other better movie in better quality?",1037318400,13,1475,4.4572490706319705
7959565,4,B000063K13,"Retromedia's release of ""The Giant of Metropolis"" is everything and more!  Not only do you get a widescreen(!!) version of the film, but a trailer collection of sword and sandal favorites (the AIP Goliath movies, and others), and a fun interview with Gordon Mitchell.
The print quality of the movie is fair to good.  The colors seem to go from rich to faded on and off throughout the film.  The audio does suffer from some crackle as well.  This film was poorly dubbed to begin with, so towards the end you will notice the audio track out of sync with the picture for a few minutes.  But you just aren't going to find a better copy of this classic anywhere else.
To sum up the plot, a lone strongman (Gordon Mitchell) goes to the mysterious city of Metropolis to warn them that their scientific experiments will lead to their doom if they don't get on the same page with everyone else in the world!  Great sets, strange characters and a surrealistic feel that can only be found in early 60's European fantasy films is all here!
If you liked SWV's ""Goliath and the Dragon"" or Trimark's ""Adventures of Hercules"" 4-pack release, you will certainly enjoy this sword and sandal rarity!",1017360000,9,1180,4.595238095238095
