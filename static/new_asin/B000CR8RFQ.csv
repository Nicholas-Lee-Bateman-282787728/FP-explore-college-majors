8367619,5,B000CR8RFQ,Yes--this is a PAL DVD. That means your lame US-format-restricting DVD player cannot read it. But you can watch on your computer--which you could hook up to your TV. Complicated? Maybe. But totes mcgotes worth it. The content is amazing and worth the 5 stars. Anni-frid Lyngstad! Frida! She's the less conservative one--the more interesting one (I love them both). The videos from the 60s are astonishing. And it only gets better. Shocking to hear that the two dudes from ABBA think they were 80% of ABBA. I bet they paid themselves 80% of the profits as well. Guess what Benny and Bjorn: we the people feel differently. You would have never accomplished what you did without these two wonderful ladies. When we put ABBA records on we're not listening to the men.,1408147200,,763,4.7443609022556394
