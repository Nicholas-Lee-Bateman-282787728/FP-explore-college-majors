3588532,5,B001FSKE84,"Reba McEntire the famous country singer, who also is an actress and by far a great one at that. Her television series  is so funny and I am proud to say I own them , but I became sad when I learned it was going off the air. There wasn't a character that could not have been on the show, without them all it was not the same. I feel that Reba did a great job raising her children as a single parent, or atleast she did the best she could. I think us moms always feel that way or atleast I do. I did the best I could with what I had. I loved Joanna Garcia and looking for other stuff she has done. Reba gives such great performances on stage whether she is singing or acting. Though the release will not be out until after Christmas, this is a gift to me from me. Love your fan",1226880000,5,775,3.8742138364779874
3588533,5,B001FSKE84,"I was one of those people who REFUSED to watch REBA when it originally aired on the WB.  And when the CW brought it back from cancellation for a sixth season I was disappointed.  Flash forward to this year and my buddy Jim got me hooked on a repeat of REBA on LIFETIME.  It was so funny.  So when the show was priced to sell at 14.99 per season on Amazon, I bought my buddy all 4 seasons. We just finished season 4. It is one of the funniest, wholesomest shows of this decade. Great family viewing.  Can't wait for Season 5. And to the fans of the show when it originally aired: YOU WERE RIGHT!",1226707200,5,594,4.086206896551724

3588589,4,B001FSKE84,"Sooner or later, every show stumbles.  At the time, fans can really be vocal and complain, but sometimes in retrospect, its not that bad.  With my recent viewing of my season 5 DVD's of Reba, I found that was exactly the case with this show (minus the complaints from the fans at the time).

Season 5 finds the extended family of Reba Hart (Reba McEntire) pretty much where we left them.  Still living at home are Reba's daughter Cheyenne (JoAnna Garcia) and son-in-law Van Montgomery (Steve Howey).  As Cheyenne tries to deal with her realization that she is an alcoholic, she starts helping the homeless, something that may change the focus of her college studies.  Meanwhile, Van is working with Reba as a realtor.  Also living there is Cheyenne and Van's 4-year-old daughter Elizabeth (who is played by Alena and Gabrielle LeBerger for the few episodes where she appears) and Jake (Mitch Hollrman).  Meanwhile, just a couple houses down the street are Reba's ex-husband Brock (Christopher Rich) and Barbara Jean (Melissa Peterman), the woman Brock left Reba for, aka the woman who thinks of Reba as her best friend.

Over the course of this season, Van gets jealous of Cheyenne's attractive sponser at AA.  He and Reba also fight so much as work they are required to attend counseling.  Barbara Jean struggles with her weight and turns to Reba and Cheyenne for help.  Reba is signed up for a dating service against her wishes.  Brock winds up having to stay with Reba when he gets kidney stones.  And an audit from the IRS leaves everyone's finances in jeopardy.

As you can see, the show mixes the serious with the more comical and manages to find humor in all of them.  My hazy memory (I haven't watched this season since it first aired almost 10 years ago) was that this show lost some of the comedy in favor of the serious, but while watching it again, I found it to be fairly funny.  It's not up to the earlier seasons, but it is better than I remembered.

Much of that lies in the one character who is absent.  Reba's middle child, daughter Kyra, is only in the season opener and in a brief scene of another episode.  Sadly, that's because Scarlett Pomers, the actress who played her, was being treated for an eating disorder.  Frankly, I spent most of season 5 wondering where she was since the character's absence is never mentioned.  And Kyra has always been my favorite character.  She has the wit and sarcasm to tell the characters the truth in a way that brings the house down.  I really did miss her character, although I applaud the show for keeping her in the credits and letting the actress get the help she needed.

Melissa Peterman was also pregnant this season, and the show only dealt with it in making Barbara Jean fat.  She was only in a small portion of a couple of episodes as well as a result.

Late in the season, they begin a story line with Cheyenne and Van that brings some of the trouble in their young marriage to a head.  I've always loved them as a couple, so I was sorry to see that.  Frankly, several stories, including this one, get short changed by the desire to not leave the season with a cliffhanger since it wasn't know if the show would make the transition to the new CW network.  (It did for a shortened 6th season, but only because it would have cost more to cut it completely.)

The acting and comedy is still wonderful.  Everyone was at the top of their game, and the laughs do definitely come.  I found myself laughing hard at multiple episodes, sometimes even at a variation of the same joke they've used for years.

Season 5 consisted for 22 episodes, and all of them are present in this two disc set.  Each disc is double sided to get them all in.  They are presented in their native full screen and full surround.  There's nothing in the way of extras.  Sadly, that includes an episode listing or guide of any kind.

So while season 5 of Reba might not be the show's funniest, it certainly still brings the laughs.  I'm glad I watched it again and recommend it to any fan, new or old, of this fun show.",1434585600,2,4057,4.496580027359781

They get into all sorts of crazy situations, usually involving family fights, but sometimes wandering into the truly bizarre (they even managed a tasteful comedy about Hurricane Katrina).

3588688,5,B001FSKE84,"If you are looking to see the episodes not in syndication they are here. This is a great season! The halloween episode is worth watching alone. So why is season 5 not in syndication, while some are? Not sure but Barbara Jean and the 'OnStar' car episode is great. Now what is missing... I think a couple were pulled because just for sales of the impending DVD reslease and then maybe Scarlett Pomers... if you watch a couple you will see her and maybe why, it is a bit of a sad sight as she is almost immaciated. Reading her profile on Wikipedia you will see she had a eating disorder during this season and checked into a help facility. She is now fully recovered but my guess is prodcucers were a bit scared to release the episodes to syndication.

Can't wait for season 6 where she is back! Scarlett has done a lot for people with eating disorders since, read about her! Really is a heart felt story.

In the mean time enjoy this season. Oh.. and just so you know the DVD does not contain the list of episodes or summary so you have to look online to get them. I printed mine. Who made this dumb mistake I do not know. But print it, and watch the halloween episode, not seen often!

Season 5 of Reba was broadcast in widescreen, but the episodes are presented here in 4:3 - that is inexcusable. Add to that the squeezing of 22 episodes onto 2 discs. The discs are double-sided, with seven episodes on one side and four on the other. The picture quality on the seven-episode sides is dreadful. The set itself consists of the two discs and a flyer - no episode guide at all.

There are episodes that can make me laugh and cry all in the same few minutes. My only complaint is that season five won't come out till after christmas. I would think they'd make it come out in time for people to buy it for christmas.
