7830871,5,6302782090,Please put the entire 6 hours on DVD. VHS tapes don't last long.,1435622400,2,64,4.0
7830872,5,6302782090,"It's a great series, I always knew parts had been cut and shorten for replay on TV, but I didn't realize entire sections had been removed. There were a couple of expert interviews that I had never even seen on the TV replays.  This was also a great seller, quick shipping and just as described.",1434499200,,294,4.345454545454546
7830873,5,6302782090,This is the very best of Revolutionary War series.,1415145600,,50,4.666666666666667
7830874,5,6302782090,My husband is a history buff and I bought this for him for Christmas. He was so thrilled.,1411430400,,89,4.0
7830875,2,6302782090,"The FULL VERSION is six episodes (about six hours).  Thanks to previous reviewers who pointed out that this is a shortened version.  For people with access to The History Channel or The Military Channel, they periodically show the full miniseries.  Crank up your DVR and enjoy the excellent full version.",1382054400,10,304,5.04
7830876,5,6302782090,"The best documentary ever produced for students of the American Revolution. Unfortunately it is not available on DVD.
Reviews for this are mixed with reviews of other productions which have lowered the ratings of  the work produced by Carol Fleisher and narrated by Charles Kuralt. This is the best I have ever seen.",1364083200,8,316,4.962264150943396
7830877,5,6302782090,"I haven't seen the video, but I have recently seen it on the military channel and it is an excellent documentary with the wonderful narration
of Charles Kuralt. I am writing this to bring the star ratings up as Amazon seems to include many reviews that don't pertain to the product advertised, unless it is one of those stupid reviews where people rate a product based on the fact that they never received it, how ridiculous is that?",1319155200,,433,4.564102564102564
7830878,1,6302782090,"Be warned: This two-hour documentary IS NOT the excellent 6-hour series with the same title that was produced by Carol Fleisher, narrated by Charles Kuralt, and televised by The Learning Channel (TLC). This is a greatly inferior version which is being misidentified as the Kuralt program; I know because I bought it and am now returning it to the seller. It is laughably bad. The TLC Kuralt series is currently unavailable in VHS as of 8/06. As another reviewer here corrected advised, SAVE YOUR MONEY, not to mention your time and trouble, and do not buy this one.",1151798400,75,565,4.775510204081633
7830879,5,6302782090,"Though primarily focussed on the militery aspects of the war, it does give basic background to the conflict.

Overall, nicely narrated, excellant use of reenactors, interviews of historians balanced and nice, participants nicely quoated from.

A most infomrative and enjoyable set of videos to watch.",1148428800,,300,5.644444444444445
