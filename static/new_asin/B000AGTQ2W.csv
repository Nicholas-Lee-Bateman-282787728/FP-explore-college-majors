8088028,5,B000AGTQ2W,"The Three Musketeers is a 1933 serial produced by Mascot Pictures and stars John Wayne. This retelling updates the famous story and it's characters. If you've been bitten by the nostalgia bug and would like to add some inexpensive cliff hanger serials to your collection, then this is a great way to do it. The DVD has good image and audio quality for a public domain title. The film materials do show signs of wear, but the overall image is sharp and clear. Echo Bridge has used very good source material for this one sided disc with 12 chapters. Like many Platinum Disc titles their company logo appears occasionally in the corner of the screen. During the early years of cinema, serials were a big part of a night out at the movies. It's quite interesting to see both John Wayne and Lon Chaney Jr. together, very early on in their careers. Enjoy!",1395014400,,849,4.555555555555555
