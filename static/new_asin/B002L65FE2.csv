8372405,4,B002L65FE2,"This ZZ Top dvd by Danny Gill was fun to play along to and learn from. The sound and instruction are very well done and as ussual Danny Gill is a great instructor for the type of Texas Blues/Rock. The songs on this dvd are classic ZZ Top and feature Intro-Chorus-and solo breakdown of all songs which are Tush, Gimme All Your Loving, La Grange, Heard It On The X and Sharp Dressed Man.
What i found interesting about Billy Gibon's soloing style was the fact that the actual solos aren't that hard but seem to rely on vibrato/string bending and timming as well as phrasing in his unique style. He manages to make a 4 note solo sting sound so very different by just using his pick attack and pinched harmonics to elevate an ordinary run into something more memorable. Also covered is his tone that is predominantly a sustained overdrive with soft touches of clean tone that are based on backing off the volume control..a great trick to learn ala Joe Bonamassa and Jimmy Page. Some of the riffs covered are such standards of rock n roll that you find yourself saying Cool...that's how he did that!.

very good dvd to have in the arsenal if your a fan of ZZ Top Or you just want some fresh approaches to blues/Rock soling.
