1652758,4,B00005R273,"My main interest in this movie was the story of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings. She is a writer who is leaving her life to pursue her writing dreams and find fulfillment in publishing a novel.

Her husband is not interested in her dreams. She decides to seek solitude in an isolated orange grove in Florida. Little does she know, this will not be an ideal life. After 30 years of urban life, she is not prepared for a small Florida town.

After many rejections, Marjorie finally realizes ""Gothic Novels"" are not her specialty. Her agent helps her see how interesting her life actually is and she begins to write about what she knows best. In the process she falls in love, makes a best-friend, helps the community by hiring everyone who lives around her to help remodel her house and fix up her orchard.

Cross Creek is based on the best-selling memoirs of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and has some very human moments when you realize the beauty or ugliness of life. The local business man (Peter Coyote) who falls in love with her, does something so amazing. It reminded me of when my father bought my mother her first car. I only know the story, but the situation is similar. Marjorie of course is very head strong and not about to take help from another man. Until she realizes what Norton Bascomb has secretly done.

Slow-paced movie that is more ""cute"" than ""dramatic."" Although, there are a few heart-wrenching moments. I thought they dwelled too long on the party, however the chocolate cake sure did look good!

Only view this movie if you have chocolate cake in the house! Preferably decorated with candied orange slices.

1652759,5,B00005R273,"Cross Creek is the story of Marjorie Rawlings, the author of the Yearling. Set in a backwoods community in Florida in the 1920s, Ms. Rawlings sets off to write the perfect gothic romance and become a published author. She arrives at her recently purchased property in a broken down automobile to find her house is nothing more than a run down shack and her orange grove completely grown over from neglect. The conflict in the movie arises from her strong willed independence and the need to become part of the community at Cross Creek in order to survive. The characters that are part of that community and the actors and actresses that portray them is precisely what makes this film one of the best dramas ever made. The screenplay is strong, the character development is rich, and the screenplay and story line is completely convincing.
Mary Steenburgen performs the lead role with elegance and a vitality rarely found in roles like this. She has more charm than Kate Hepburn, and she manages to be so believable because she can navigate the feistiness, fear, anger, frustration, sadness, and humor of Ms. Rawlings and her adventures at Cross Creek without missing a beat. Peter Coyote plays Mr. Norton Baskin, a local innkeeper seeking her attention. Alfre Woodard brilliantly plays Geechie, her maid and manages to steal a few scenes in the process. But the two supporting performances that stand out are those of Rip Torn and Dana Hill. Torn and Hill are father and daughter from a dirt poor family try to scrap a living on the creek. They befriend Rawlings, and what results is the real life inspiration for the Yearling.
I believe this film was nominated for four Academy Award Nominations - with three acting nominations - one each for Rip Torn, Alfre Woodard, and Steenburgen. If you enjoy good drama, strong female roles, true stories, or just plain great acting, this would be a fine addition to any collection. My only disappointment with the DVD package is the film is presented in mono instead of Dolby Stereo, but the picture quality is superb. They even managed to include a short featurette. Still, I give this movie five stars, and highly recommend. It is one of my personal favorites.",1027555200,82,2203,4.8153034300791555
1652760,5,B00005R273,"When was the last time you felt the hairs stand up on your arms as you watched a film?  This radiant, measured drama, with a stubborn, diffident and magnetic performance by Mary Steenburgen, does it for me every time.  Telling the story of writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings and her sojurn in rural Florida in the 20's, it paints (and for once ""paints"" is the right verb) an eloquent portrait of the artist-as-not-always-likeable person, and also conveys an overwhleming sense of place and community.  Martin Ritt's great feeling for ordinary people breathes extraordinary life into this material, and the location settings and photography are superb.  Also superb are the supporting performances, including the acclaimed pairing of Rip Torn and the late, astonishing child actor Dana Hill as father and daughter.  But my personal favorite is Alfre Woodard's all-out, headlong portrayal of Geechee, Rawling's devoted, wild woman housekeeper.  This is the only film I know that conveys a real sense of the writer's life, and without pretense at that.  As for the raising of the hairs, there is nothing else in film to compare with the final lyrical montage that concludes the picture.  As Steenburgen speaks words from the text of Rawling's original ""Cross Creek,"" Ritt gives us image after ravishing image of Cross Creek and environs.  Once seen, you will never forget it.  The DVD is beautifully produced.  A treasure.",1015372800,53,1416,5.139737991266376
1652761,5,B00005R273,"Mary Steenbergen's portrayal of writer Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings is very believable - she's independent and a little stand-offish, but comes to care for her backwoods (and often eccentric) neighbors at Cross Creek as she  adjusts to country life in the 1920's.  Rip Torn is entertaining and  touching as her sometimes-inebriated friend and neighbor Marsh Turner, and  Peter Coyote is a charming friend and suitor.  The movie is shot on  location near Cross Creek, which enhances this interpretation of her 1941  bestselling book of the same name.",938649600,87,545,5.267441860465116

1652796,5,B00005R273,"This is a gentle, quiet, movie with a calm but interesting plot.  It's like peeking through a window at a slice of life in the experiences of a struggling writer.  If your tastes have become accustomed to the adrenaline rush of popular movies today, you may not appreciate the  relative ""quiet"" of this film.  The movie is set in the bayou and swamps of the south where a struggling writer lives away from the mad bustle of life in the city in order that she can develop her writing.  Her daily round of interaction with the people of the poverty stricken bayou is what in the end creates the long-awaited success in her first book.  There's a romantic development between her and a local town-man, but the movie is really about the people she encounters and her relationship to them.  The main character's dialogue is nothing to write home about and it seemed the acting was understated, but somehow, life in the swamp was captivating nonetheless.  This refreshingly a movie where we aren't assaulted with a stream of foul language or uncomfortable sex scenes.  Even the one scene in the end when the sherif shoots the main male character, is very brief and not at all gruesome.  It's a movie I can easily watch with all family members including my grandchildren.  There's a certain education to be absorbed for young people and perhaps for us all.  There's something nostalgic in the construction of this movie; something that goes back to a time when movies could uplift and entertain without searing our sensitivities.",1492646400,8,1522,4.767175572519084

1652806,1,B00005R273,"After an hour of watching this movie, I decided to turn it off.  Mary Steenbergen's portrayal of the character she is suppose to portray is dull and un-engaging.  I think she does a horrible job.  Either that, or whoever wrote the script did a terrible job.  Her character seems almost zombie-like.  There is no subtlety or nuance in her performance. In one scene, she  is invited to a neighbor's house for a ""pound party""  only to find a mom and her four children.  Other than saying hello, she never once engages her hostess or tries to have a conversation with her or her four children.  She sits at the table with a blank confused expression, eats cake, looks at the children, and then leaves when a ride arrives.  I love soft, subtle, human experience/drama movies, but this missed the mark.  There is nothing about this character portrayal that is remotely likeable, engaging, or speaks of depth.  A real loser.",1485302400,,917,4.69811320754717

Steenburgen and Rip Torn are in top form and there is a strong supporting cast.

Thjs film about a writer finding her literary voice is pitch perfect,  not overwrought or overly dramatic.  The director and the actors are confident in what they are doing so nothing is overdone (except for a couple of scenery shots).

I have it now on my Kindle and it is such a well-written book with many lesson still to b learned. This biographical movie is extremely well done and introduced me to Mary Steenburgen who is still great. She actually pretty much looks the same! It was also the first time I had seen another great actress, Alfe Woodard, who also still looks pretty much the same. In any case, this move follows the life soon after the divorce of Marjorie Kinnan Rowlings  and how she went from New York society to Southern rural orange farming on the bayou. It is beautifully shot, wonderfully acted and evocative of the South at the time of the Roaring 20's. In a place where life was a struggle, people lived hand to mouth and trust and humanity and being true to your neighbors counted for something. This is not an action packed, car crash type of movie. The pace is slow and the focus is upon human relations and culpability of actions. So, if you don't like movies that ""talk"" a lot and lack action, this isn't for you. If you are interested in good literature, feminism, the rural South and history, then this movie IS for you.

Everyone has liked the movie and said ""it was interesting,""  ""Mary Steenburgen is a good actress,""  and other words of praise.  The movie brings a divergence of different personalities together, and teaches us how we can all get along.  Mary Steenburgen plays the role of a gifted author and a very determined woman.  The scenery is very pretty and shows how people can survive without our current modern conveniences.  The movie is funny, dramatic, and educates us as to how people lived in another time and place.

I loved the swampy scenery and the moss hanging from the trees and all she miraculously accomplishes with a shack,but it just didn't touch true to life.  I think if they had chosen different actors for some of the characters,it would have played out better. The two main characters Mary Steenburgen,and Peter Coyote are good,but Rip Torn was not that convincing to me. I feel bad writing such negativity about this movie,so maybe you should buy it anyways.

They (the actors) draw you in and leave you wondering what you would do if it were you in their situations.  I was also totally captivated by the scenery!  I feel honored to have been able to see this movie.  I would recommend that the ""WORLD"" watch it!  This movie has something for everyone from the start!

1653202,5,B00005R273,"I chose this movie because I liked reading her book ""The Yearling"" as a young teenager, and I am so glad I purchased this DVD.  They filmed this movie here in Florida, in the area where it all actually took place all those years ago.  The cinematography is above average, the production over all is nearly perfect too.  The actors did a pretty good job and I think the directing is as good as it gets.  It is basically a true story based on her memoirs, which means some of the story is sad, and it gives you an understanding for the way The Yearling turns out.
  Being a Southerner and native Floridian I find one disappointment with this movie.  I can only guess it is simple ignorance on the part of the production company, but they filled the sound background with jungle sounds from Central America or maybe it was even Africa, but it is not the right sounds for our native wild animals and birds.  Another sad bit for me, the actors that have to fake a Southern accent, well they almost always come up short.  It is a mute point for most of the viewers I know, but maybe it would be best if they tried to get actors that actually speak with a Southern Accent to begin with, but I am sure they don't see this as important.
  Otherwise it is a really great movie production, and if you did not know we don't have howling monkeys in the forest and swamps here,  then you probably could not tell the actors fell so short of a proper Southern accent either, in which case you would likely love the movie too.  My wife simply loved the movie and thanked me for getting it.  I guess it is a good chick flick too.",1340582400,,1611,4.239344262295082

Like her book of the same title, the movie presents the country folk in her neighborhood and their response to the northern writer with all her eccentricities. The acting in this movie is superb. Mary Steenburgen as Marjorie, Peter Coyote as her future husband, Rip Torn as her moonshine producing neighbor, Dana Hill as his daughter and Alfre Woodard as the feisty maid breath real life into their characters. Steenburgen, Torn and Woodard earned Academy Award nominations for their acting.

1653215,5,B00005R273,"Cross Creek is a film of gentle beauty and one of the most refreshing portraits of a writer ever put on celluloid. Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings was one of America's greatest writers, her stories serialized in The Saturday Evening Post, and her memoir, Cross Creek, one of the loveliest evocations of a place and time ever found in American letters. She is much too often dismissed nowadays as too Southern and too sentimental. This is director Martin Ritt's apology for that notion.

Mary Steenburgen captures Rawlings in fine fashion. As the memoir begins, in 1928, she is a writer unhappy with her life in society and the husband from whom she has grown apart. Max Perkins (Malcolm McDowell), her editor, keeps rejecting her gothic romances, so she purchases a run down orange grove in Florida and, after filing for divorce, begins a new life in Cross Creek. What she discovers in this beautiful but harsh place will change who she is as both a person and a writer.

Director Ritt stunningly captures the beauty of Cross Creek and the few people who live there. It is here that Rawlings meets her future husband Norton Bascomb (Peter Coyote) and everyone else who would inspire her great novels. Rawlings slowly becomes a part of Cross Creek as she cares for her orange groves and keeps writing. Her letters to Perkins are better than her romance novels he keeps rejecting and the people of Cross Creek begin to take more and more prominence in her work.

Rip Torn gives a memorable performance as Marsh Turner, and a young Dana Hill is unforgettable as Ellie May, the apple of his eye holding tightly to the last of her youthful dreams in the form of her fawn, Flag. They would be the inspiration for The Yearling. Alfrie Woodard, as the enthusiastic Geechee, put herself on the map with her fine portrayel of Rawlings' housemaid and friend. Joanna Miles is fine as Marsh's wife, a delicate woman who has slipped into a better world due to the harsh nature of life in Cross Creek.

Ritt's direction is sure as he mixes the humor and drama of life in Cross Creek with the inner struggle of a very unique and gutsy woman. This is a gentle but heartfelt tribute to one of America's finest, albeit forgotten writers. It is a warm and lovingly filmed tribute with an elegant performance by Steenburgen as a woman who chose to live her life in a backwoods portion of Florida which she would make famous. A fine film about a fine writer.",1251417600,19,2429,4.641860465116279

I love his voice-overs, but we are missing out on his fine acting talents!)Alfre Woodard, and Dana Hill, but the more minor roles too are so well done.

Rip Torn's performance as Marsh Turner is just stellar--one of the best things I've ever seen him do.  And Alfre Woodard 'becomes' Gee Chee in a realistic but not over-the-top portrayal of her character.  Really, really lovely film.",1225152000,2,567,4.936842105263158

1653225,5,B00005R273,"Mary Steenburgen, playing Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, should have won her own Academy Award for her performance.  She also is presented in a 17 minute featurette called Cross Creek: A Look Back with Mary Steenburgen. That is a great extra included on the DVD.  Rip Torn, playing a Cross Creek swamp father of a local family, and Alfre Woodard, playing Rawling's live-in housekeeper, both were nominated for best supporting roles.  The entire cast makes this a pleasant story to watch.

Rawlings (this a true story) struggles with her writing ability on a backwoods orange farm bought for the seclusion.  What she discovers is a group of neighborhood people that she eventually becomes a part of.  Because of the Florida bayou move and leaving her husband, the stage is set for some very remarkable stories to be written.  Others have mentioned ""The Yearling"" (1938) which won Rawlings a Pulitzer-Prize.  Besides that and Cross Creek (1942) she also wrote South Moon Under, 1933; Golden Apples, 1935; When the Whipperwill, 1940; Jacob's ladder, 1950; The Sojourner, 1953; and Secret River in 1955.  Because of this movie I want so much to read ""Jacob's Ladder"".

Hopefully someone will discover the delights in these other stories by Rawlings and create another movie version.  Cross Creek ends with delight and leaving the viewer wanting more.  Mary Steenburgen makes you want to visit Florida and Cross Creek for a long vacation and interaction with the folks living there.  And of course, while there, to thank Marjorie Keenan Rawlings in person for her stories.  The Florida setting is great and the movie is rated PG which also could represent ""Pleasantly Grandiose"".

Many consider the story to have a theme of ""women's independence"" but I feel Rawlings shows the struggle in all, men and women, for achievement and success through inner ability and desire.  Truly a story for the whole family, just like The Yearling.",1212883200,,1921,5.050793650793651

This movie will draw you into its arms and give you a hug. Great for men and women.

Peter Coyote is a stand out! you'll recognize his voice as I did from documentaries and other narrated films. He's an incredible actor.

Rip Torn does a spectacular job as a ""cracker"" who's taken his family to live in rural Florida. His daughter is the inspiration of the author's, Ms Rawlings', wonderful novel, The Yearling.

The viewer is drawn back to the Depression Era through a wondrous camera lens right in the location of the actual events. Perhaps it has been cleaned up a bit from those difficult times, yet it's so great seeing the dusty old cars and fashions, the barefoot kids, and the primitive life of a bygone era.
