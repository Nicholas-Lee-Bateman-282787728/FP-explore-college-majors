8462092,2,B0058OU24W,"Sadly, this Video Dimensions product is not an official DVD release, just a DVD-R of the fan-subtitled TV recording circulating on the internet.

The rights belong to Rene Chateau Video who have now released the film on a proper DVD in France.",1457740800,4,243,4.785714285714286
8462093,4,B0058OU24W,"A must for all fans of Jean Renoir.  This is the earliest film version of Simenon's Maigret, played quite nicely by Renoir's older brother Pierre Renoir.  Some of the cuts may be due to the film's age and condition, yet it moves well and the eroticized femme fatale is disturbingly well acted.",1440979200,4,293,4.615384615384615
8462094,4,B0058OU24W,sometimes hard to follow because of its age but it is a Maigret mystery worth watching,1427500800,2,86,4.4375
8462095,5,B0058OU24W,Maigret realized on film as seldom before or since. Actors embody characters in spot-on rendition of one of Simenon's most satisfying Maigret mysteries.,1375747200,4,152,5.6521739130434785
8462096,3,B0058OU24W,"Jean Renoir is indisputably one of the greatest directors in film history but, though he made several fine films in the twenties and early thirties, I don't think he really found his artistic voice until mid-decade.  The Night at the Crossroads is an excellent whodunit based on a Georges Simenon novel with the director's brother Pierre Renoir as the canny Inspector Maigret.  Well-acted and beautifully photographed with a pre-Noir aura, it is an entertaining night at the movies, if not at the astounding level of Renoir's late thirties work like A Day in the Country, Grand Illusion, and Rules of the Game.",1353196800,9,610,4.970588235294118
