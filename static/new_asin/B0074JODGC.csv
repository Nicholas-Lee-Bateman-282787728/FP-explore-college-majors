8510081,5,B0074JODGC,"Yes. This is required viewing for all fans of Rowland S. Howard and the various bands Nick Cave has played in. It's the all-too-common story of a musician who just never gets the ""break"" needed to survive off his art.",1440460800,,217,4.45
8510082,5,B0074JODGC,"Wonderful way to get to know the beautiful, pained soul that was Roland S Howard.  A must for any Nick Cave, Swans, Einsturzende Neubaten fan.
Speaks loudly to those who are tortured with depression. Roland had a gift of cutting to the core of sorrow, wrapping around the strings of his guitar, and neatly placing into a song that can drag you by your dusty coat tails into the night.",1430006400,,384,4.485714285714286
8510083,5,B0074JODGC,"this film is absolutely touching. Anyone that is fan of the Birthday Party, Crime and the City Solution, These Immortal Souls but most importantly, Rowland.

You will see thee most definitive road of this man's life, and the film is done in a great manner. Great interviews, footage, and amazing music.

8510084,2,B0074JODGC,"I liked the movie don't get me wrong, but what I was waiting for during the whole documentary was his demise.
I wanted them to talk about his illness, and a little about his death.  I wanted to see the reality of what drugs can do, and the
what the lifestyle of a rockstar can as well.  I thought the reality would have shed some light, and made his character more real.  Sort of like the movie about Klaus Nomi, ""The Nomi Song"", not that they are alike just their fate.  I was disappointed when they didn't even tell you what he died of, and the trial he felt along the way.  Really disappointed...",1402704000,,599,4.219298245614035
8510085,5,B0074JODGC,"Guitar God of the 80s/90s finally gets his story told. The quotes from his book that are used to break up the scenes is quite boring, but the rest of it is pure gold. Very tragic, yet beautiful story. Best spagehtti-western/blues/jazz/post-punk guitarist ever?!?!?! I think so.",1386633600,,277,5.043478260869565
