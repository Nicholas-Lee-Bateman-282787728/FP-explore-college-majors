This A&E Biography was so beautiful and it got so into depth. This Biography really touched some of the same facts that the book Doris Day: Her Story by A.E.Hotchner touched. Doris had such a sad and a happy life. It was also fun to see clips from so many of her movies. It was so sad to me that she went through 4 bad marriages that poor woman. But she always stuck it out and kept happy. She is a woman to admire. No matter what the hardship she kept smiling. This is a great A&E Biography, of a great Woman. I highly suggest this film to everyone.",1096848000,3,725,3.9054054054054053
7788701,5,076701443X,"Well, it paid off! I, along with thousands of her fans, bombarded BIOGRAPHY with letters and e-mails to do a TWO HOUR special on Doris Day. We felt that one hour would not be enough to cover her entire career which included radio, nightclubs, recordings, movies and television.  Doris Day's career has been spectacular. To this day, she remains the Top Female Box Office Star of All Time. For ten years, she was on Herald's Top Ten List, several times at the very top of that list. This was a remarkable achievement. What is even more amazing is that Miss Day had a second, full time career as a recording artist and she charted regularly with big hits like ""Whatever Will Be, Will Be,"" ""Secret Love"", ""It's Magic"", ""Everybody Loves a Lover"", ""If I Give My Heart to You"" and many more. She was bringing out two albums per year, plus the soundtracks from her films. As a result, her discography is vast.
During all of this success was a private life, which was not all ""moonlight and roses"". As outlined in her biography, DORIS DAY: HER OWN STORY by A. E. Hotchner, Day's childhood was not perfect, neither were her marriages. The persona created by the fan magazines was in stark contrast to the lady on the silver screen's private life. Day was never Miss Goody Two-Shoes, but she was a decent, caring human being. Because of her decency and desire to set a good example for her son, she was unfairly mocked during the turbulence of the late '60s when social standards were changing.
A harrowing incident involving Charles Manson brought an uneasiness to her life and a fear that the Manson family might harm her or her son.
This documentary covers most of Doris Day's life and the interviews with Terry Melcher, Kaye Ballard, Les Brown, Molly Haskell, etc. are very enlightening.
Now, it's time for Lifetime's Intimate Portraits to do a THREE HOUR Tribute to, arguably, ""the last of the great movie queens"", Doris Day.",993945600,47,1920,4.663716814159292
