ALL of the VCI shorts here are included on the 20 titles on both of the Alpa Video releases.  In both cases, the shorts are not restored and the picture quality is about the same, with VCI being marginally better.  Unfortunately five VCI titles are on Alpha's volume 1 and five are on volume 2, so you can not pick this up and get just one Alpha volume. (A good time for a slow burn)

Here are the shorts included in this set, Alpha Video volumes are listed next to the title:
BABY DAZE (1939) Alpha vol 2
GOOD HOUSEWRECKING (1933) Alpha vol 1
ROUGH ON RENTS (1942) Alpha vol 2
WILL POWER (1936) Alpha vol 1
HELP WANTED, FEMALE (1930-PATHE) Alpha vol 1
WRONG DIRECTION (1934) Alpha vol 1

7996912,4,B0000AC8ME,"As of 9/09, this was the only available DVD package of Edgar Kennedy's ""Average Man"" shorts. The set is flawed only because his earliest classic work gets little representation here. Like Laurel & Hardy, Mr. Kennedy's funniest two-reelers were all created before 1937.

The supporting cast (Edgar's family) changed a bit from the series' 1931 inception until its 1948 finish. For example, Florence Lake was the ideal flighty mile-a-minute talking wife, while Sally Payne, seen briefly in the early 1940s, took a different approach to the Mrs. Kennedy role. In these years, Irene Ryan (Granny on THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES) also appeared in some of Edgar's comedies.

Note that Florence Lake did return to the cast after a few years' hiatus and stayed with the series to its conclusion. However, her yammering scatterbrain is most exuberant in the first few dozen productions.",1253232000,2,872,5.177304964539007

7996914,4,B0000AC8ME,"VCI Entertainment presents ""EDGAR KENNEDY TWO-REELER COMEDY COLLECTION""  (1930-1946) (180 mins) (Glorious Black & White/Fully Restored/Dolby Digitally Remastered) --- Edgar Livingston Kennedy was an American comedic film actor, known as ""the king of the slow burn"" --- A former singer and boxer, Kennedy worked in hundreds of films beginning as a Keystone Kop in 1914 --- He would go on to work with the biggest film comedians in the United States, including Fatty Arbuckle, Charles Chaplin, Laurel and Hardy, the Marx Brothers and Our Gang --- He also starred in his own series of short domestic comedies from the early 1930s until his death.

Kennedy is possibly best-known today for a small but memorable role as a lemonade salesman in the Marx Brothers film Duck Soup in the 1930s --- One of his hit films, though not always remembered, from the 40s was Monogram Pictures' ""Cosmo Jones in The Crime Smasher"" where he played ""Police Chief Murphy"" opposite a young Gale Storm, an aging Richard Cromwell, and the then-popular Frank Graham in the role of Cosmo, a character derived from a long running network radio serial.

A stocky, bald man, Kennedy was well-known for a reaction known in comedy as the ""slow burn"" when angered --- In 2005, a belated biography was published about Kennedy's life and career,written by Bill Cassara -- (From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

7996915,3,B0000AC8ME,"Getting to see Edgar Kennedy's seldom-seen RKO short subjects of the 1930's and 40's is a treat. They are down-to-earth, middle America humor. Kennedy's starring series was nicknamed ""Mr. Everyman"" and the name fits. Also, his trademark slow burn and bursts of temper are sights to behold.
It's too bad that VCI spent so little time with this collection. The content is great, but most of the prints are at best good and for the most part fair to poor, especially ""I'll Build It Myself"" which looks like it came from a 10th generation bootleg videotape.
The sound on most of the shorts is either muffled or hidden in a sea of hiss and static.
But if you can weather the low quality, the films themselves are, for the most part, gems of a bygone era. Florence Lake plays Kennedy's wife in most of the shorts and she was a real doll.
I hope that some company will one day give Edgar Kennedy and the other stars of short subjects the respect they deserve and present their films with clear, remastered pictures and cleaned-up sound. As VCI has presented this collection, the viewer only gets a hint at some wonderful comedy from Hollywood's golden age.",1074297600,18,1149,4.609756097560975
