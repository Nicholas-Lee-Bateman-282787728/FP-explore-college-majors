7931902,4,B000056BS0,"This early Yen film about a doctor, Yen who falls in love with a mobster's sister. The mobster wants to take over the land the people live on so when fights erupt in the street Yen comes to the rescue of the people. The 1990's were the golden age of cinema for gangster films in Hong kong thanks to John Woo's A Better Tomorrow series and this film shares some of the same trademarks from the heroic bloodshed genre, honor, loyalty, melodrama and a tragic ending.",1461024000,,463,4.395348837209302
7931903,3,B000056BS0,"This is a good film of Donnie Yen, not great, it does have some nice fight scenes, and is worth it to add to your collection of his. Im a big fan of his,Ip man 1 & 2 are at his best, if you only want his best, I did like this one though.",1330473600,,237,3.4074074074074074
7931904,2,B000056BS0,"Donnie Yen (""Iron Monkey"", ""Shanghai Knights"") directs and stars as a doctor who opens a clinic in a village ruled under the iron fist of the Axe Gang.  The gang's leader, played by Yu Rongguang (""Iron Monkey"", ""Shanghai Noon""), has given the town an ultimatum:  Leave or die.  A big fight breaks out but the cops eventually stop it.  Donnie goes to talk with an old colleague who turns out to be financing the Axe Gang and a truce is called.  Meanwhile, Donnie meets the gang leader's mute sister (Athena Chu Yun) and knows of a procedure that can cure her.  The Fox God is already scheduled to fix the problem and her brother wants nothing to do with contemporary methods.  Well, she is in love with Donnie and wants him to do the surgery anyway.  Then to add to all the drama, someone starts killing children in the village and harvesting their organs!!  Thankfully, nothing gruesome is shown.

This is not a bad movie, it's just not a good martial arts movie.  There are plenty of fights, but nothing particularly interesting about any of them.  Stylish slo-mo with some undercranking, and they're shot in a way that makes it really hard to tell what's going on.  The story is well-told and the actors are good, especially Yu Rongguang.  This seems to be an exercise for Donnie's directing ability but not for his fight choreography.

This disc was distributed by Universal Laser & Video Company Ltd., and is becoming increasingly hard to find.  After viewing it, I understand the film's lack of demand.  It is partially widescreen and the picture quality is good, but nothing spectacular.  Languages are limited to Cantonese or Mandarin with English subtitles.  No real special features either.  As punishment for this film, the two leads were eventually forced to share screen-time with the insufferable Owen Wilson.  Donnie learned his lesson and made ""S.P.L."" shortly thereafter.  2.5/5

7931905,5,B000056BS0,the best donnie yen movies right now!  The fighting scenes are fanstatic.  This movie is all about Donnie Yen.  His martial art styles might not be as great as Bruce Lee but it flawlessly more beautiful and enegertic than Jet Li and Jackie Chan.  He the real deal. I know my kung fu movies and this is one of my all time favorites.,1049760000,,331,4.2063492063492065
7931906,4,B000056BS0,"First off, I'm a huge donnie yen fan and own just about everything he has, and I'm glad to own this movie. I agree that he has defintely done better, but this is an all round decent movie. The story sort of keeps your attention: Donnie is a doctor who opens a clinic in a very poor village with his assistant Bond. A gang led by the very underated Yu Rong Guang (the Iron Monkey in Iron Monkey) wants to clear out this village to open a casino. Of course, Donnie and his partner, who happens to be a pretty decent fighter, are protectant of the village people. Soon after, children from the village get kidnapped, and the reason for it is kind of silly in my opinion. Mainly though, it's the love story element involving Donnie that keeps you interested. Just watch it and find out. The fighting is for the most part pretty good. I mean I've seen much worse like Donnie's Legend of The Wolf (or New Big Boss), now that was bad. There are a only a few fights in the film due to more focus on story, but most of the fights are pretty damn good. Yu shows some of the best fighting skills I've seen from him, and this really surprised me...at the time of this film, he is not a very young man at all, but he gave Donnie a run for his money. These 2 went at it very aggressively, and all their fights looked painful. They seemed equal in speed and strength, and knowing how fast Donnie can get...whew. I must say that the camera work is different, but far from bad...Legend of The Wolf was pathetic camera work cuz I couldn't see a thing...at least in Shanghai Affairs I could see the fighters' moves when I wanted and needed to. When Yu and Donnie go at it, it's pretty crazy and if you keep an eye on the background elements such as the leaves moving around, it's pretty surreal. The last fight is obviously the highlight with Yu pulling out an axe on a chain and using it with apparent skill. A complaint I have is there is one pathetic fight scene where Donnie, with a TREE BRANCH, takes out like 30 guys armed with axes....boooooo...very reminiscent of Legend of the Wolf. With the exception of this fight, the other scenes are very good. Another complaint are the horrible sound effects on the dvd, off point sometimes and just wrong sounds for certain blocks and attacks. But overall, this is a decent film as long as you're patient to wait for the fights, and the fights are something to watch. Great choreography and no doubles. It is defintely worth checking out folks if you're etchy about buying it, but it is pretty cheap. Seek out the Universe Laser version though, this above version I've never seen before and it doesn't look very impressive. The Universe is unfortunately the best version so far with mono sound and slightly blurry, but watchable video. The Chinese language is kept intact with english subs. Obviously this is nowhere near Donnie's best work, but Yu Rong Guang shines here. For better Donnie flicks, check out Iron Monkey, In the Line of Duty 4, Wing Chun w/ Michelle Yeoh, OUATIC 2 w/ Jet Li, & Tiger Cage 2 (awesome). Check out my other MA reviews too, thanks for reading.",1042156800,2,3103,4.4171029668411865
7931907,2,B000056BS0,"During the opening scene, it appears to be a very action packed movie, but the action is hard to follow sometimes because of the close ups on the fighters.  I could not get a good feel for the movie because of this.  I thought Donnie Yen could have done a much better job with his skills, but I was not impressed.  If your looking for a good Donnie Yen movie don't look here. Try Iron Monkey or Sword and Butterfly, the latter may not show a lot of Yen, but what it does show is damn good.",982108800,5,489,4.020618556701031
7931908,5,B000056BS0,"another one of Donnie's movies, where he stars, choreographs and directs......he has given the movie a very fluent feeling...the fight scenes are very good and edited very well.......Donnie really knows how to  amaze people with his new way of film making...I'd recommend this movie to  anyone!",964137600,,294,5.369565217391305
