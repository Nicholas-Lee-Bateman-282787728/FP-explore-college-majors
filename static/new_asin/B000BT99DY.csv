8092083,5,B000BT99DY,"Mike V has the right attitude about skating.  Long before it exploded, the corporations got involved and the term ""skater"" wasn't a social label, skating was about a culture, if you skated you were a member, there was little if any cliques' or divisions.  It rarely mattered if you could ollie, didn't matter if you could could barely stand on the board if you skated and found skaters, you were with friends.  This video conveys all that, it may not appeal to the younger crowd, but it it is representative of the way things used to be and the true meaning of skating.  I skate with my 14 year old son...im 36....and the modern scene is pretty unappealing in a lot of ways.  Seems if you don't skate rails and stairs your somehow not a skater....which is bulls***.  Ive tried to explain to my son how it was to skate in the 80s, once he saw the Drive series he finally understood.  Bravo to Mike V. for keeping it alive.",1176768000,7,921,4.382352941176471
