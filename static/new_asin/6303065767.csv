Set in the nouveau riche ski resort of Vail, Colorado, the rather

weak plot centers upon the paranoid possessiveness of a superrich

internationalist, Roland Parlay (Eric Braeden) and his understandably terrified ""trophy wife"", Michelle (Britt Ekland).

Parlay murders, gruesomely, one would-be roue, Tom Moore (played to obnoxious perfection by actor Michael Blodgett)for putting the ""make"" on his spouse (who, contrary to Parlay's delusions, is

totally faithful to him), then invites a young, idealistic writer, Joe Strayker (Barry Brown) to keep his wife company in their chalet while he attends a business meeting. The shyly-handsome Strayker tells Michelle Parlay a story from one of his books, and entranced with his gentleness - she falls in love.

Parlay returns, gun in hand, aiming to kill Strayker on the

pretext that he cuckolded the deranged plutocrat, but the innocent Strayker is back at his lodge, where Michelle Parlay

flees to warn the young writer of impending danger.

However, Strayker foolishly returns to the chalet, and the insane Parlay forces Strayker into a skiing contest - for his life.

During the race, though, Strayker falls and apparently breaks

a bone. Parlay (who has a bow-and-arrow) throws Strayker a gun, which Strayker (to Parley's surprise) uses defensively - with deadly accuracy.

At the end, the newly-minted widow Parlay seeks out Joe Strayker

in the village of Vail, and clings to him passionately.

Eric Braeden is silkily, and Continentally sophisticated as the ruthless,sociopathic Roland Parlay. Britt Ekland is convincingly traumatized as the frightened victim/wife of the sinister plutocrat, Parley. The late Barry Brown was hauntingly handsome,

with a sad-eyed, sweet smile, and his usual fine performance made him a memorable part of this forgettable movie.

Unless you watch this movie for its breathtaking scenery, its dramatic episodes of acrobatic skiing, or any, or all of the three performers, my advice is - save your time for more important considerations; that's ""the ultimate thrill.""",1150761600,3,2100,5.455108359133127
