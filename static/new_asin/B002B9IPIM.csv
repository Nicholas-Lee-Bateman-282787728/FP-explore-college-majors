8360889,2,B002B9IPIM,"Disney magic usurps good science.  Bill Nye is fun.  But, these are geared for 3rd or 4th grade when these topics are first introduced.  I was hoping for meatier videos with good presentation.  There is no indepth science here.",1369353600,2,227,4.743589743589744
8360890,5,B002B9IPIM,"The world of atoms is so abstract for the human brain, that making information understandable for children takes special tactics. Bill Nye the Science Guy achieves this for students at all levels of development. Using young people in the program helps pull in the tweenagers who are studying these concepts. Great job!",1368057600,5,318,5.134615384615385
