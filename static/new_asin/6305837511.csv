7897286,4,6305837511,"Last night's entertainment was watching the ""Stormchasers"" DVD. It's a program originally created for showing in IMAX theaters. The DVD comes in two parts with the first the ""Stormchasers"" program itself and the second ""The Making of Stormchasers."" Of course, you''d want to watch both at the same sitting, if possible. The programs document the study of major storms. Hurricanes along the Atlantic Coast are featured as well as tornados in Oklahoma. A much lesser part includes the monsoon season of India. The programs are interesting and informative. The photography is excellent, magnificent in places. It's a good DVD, albeit a little short and skimpy, in an educational sense. Well worth watching.

7897287,2,6305837511,I was disappointed by the lack of drama. It was like watching a boring version of the eleven o'clock news.,1298592000,,106,4.35
7897288,4,6305837511,"This is good for what it is - a short IMAX film about stormchasing. Most IMAX films are 45 minutes or less, so a viewer should not be expecting a real-life two hour version of Twister. It also covers a lot of material, so it doesn't go into depth. Also, the team fails to see tornadoes and then when they get one, they run out of film (this often happens in IMAX because they can only shoot something like 90 seconds at a time). Overall, though, pretty good.",1109894400,4,458,4.215909090909091
7897289,3,6305837511,"As a severe storm lover, I eagerly awaited this DVD. The opening sceen starts out wonderful with beautiful DTS sound. Then it quickly goes down hill from there. It interviews a few ""Hurricance Experts"" and chasers, shows video of them flying through the eyewall of Hurricane Emily. From there, well it really does not show much more on Hurricanes. Then Tornadoes are discussed. Video of only one tornado and the chase! I was disappointed! I was expecting lightning, towering thunderstorms and a few more tornado videos. If you want an excellent storm video, get National Geographic's ""Natures Fury"". It is superb compared to this. More footage and great sound.",1009929600,34,660,5.064220183486238
7897290,1,6305837511,I was very disappointed with this video.  There was little actual storm footage.  Mostly about the weather equipment.,1006560000,,117,5.444444444444445
7897291,2,6305837511,"I'm not sure if it was the huge screen, or what, but when I saw this feature in Omnimax it was much more impressive! The video is good, the sound is awesome on a surround sound system, but there is little storm footage. If I wanted to watch the people who chase storms, I could turn on TLC or the Discovery channel.
Spend your money on Twister if you're looking for a storm flick! Sure the tornados are Hollywood-made but at least you get to see them for more than 60 seconds!! This DVD ...! I want my money back!",994896000,4,513,4.14
7897292,2,6305837511,"I expected to see some spectaular footage of storms, tornadoes and hurricanes, especially considering the creditionals of the director.  Instead we are shown some pretty lame footage and some barely interesting descriptions of the methods and equipment the stormchasers use.  Sound was pretty good with the right setup, but at 38mins you do want to be ""blown away"" by the content.  This just does not deliver.  Check out ""Everest"" if you want to buy an IMAX DVD.",980985600,11,462,4.961038961038961
7897293,5,6305837511,"An experienced and masterful director, Greg Macgillivray raises the industry standards while using the available technology with clear  intentions: entertain, wonder and educate the viewer without loosing the  edge of the story. An Imax expert, he has also stunned the viewer with The  Living Seas (with a beautiful Sting soundtrack), the Everest and  Discoverers. Here, he takes you for a rough ride inside Hurricane Emily-to  its very peaceful eye- and later he chases a very large and freightening  tornado. He also visits India to report the monsoon season. He succeeds as  usual and stays commited to his credo: raise the quality standards. The  audio is impressive and the image has the tipical yet outstanding Imax  beauty. Check out the ""making of"" section and share the exitement  of the film crew and cientists involved. A real masterpiece. BUY IT!.",966988800,3,859,5.159420289855072
7897294,5,6305837511,"Mac-Free films put together a wonderfully edited and perfectly scored film  documenting hurricane and tornado researchers.  This film, like all films  filmed in 70mm IMAX, MUST be seen in an IMAX Theater to be fully enjoyed  and appreciated.  However, this DVD is wonderful at home with a surround  sound system and is better than anything else of the same subject matter  you can find on a television screen.",965174400,,409,4.926470588235294
