3489955,5,B001BEK8EC,"Bergman makes films with the depth and subtlety that a writer uses in writing great novels. This film is a lodestone in it's ability to set the template for all future films. There is a nightmare sequence that is truly astonishing,clocks without hands,people without faces,a coffin revealing himself that has fallen off a carriage. The power of the leading actor(Sjostrom) who himself was one of Sweden's great directors, to convey changes of emotion from sadness to joy. The road trip he takes, is both external by car to Lund to collect an honorary doctorate for his lifetime acheivements. Its also internal,through dreams and memories into the wild strawberry-patch of the unconscious. With his daughter-in-law Marianne(Tulin) he explores the highways and the by-ways,picking up hitch-hikers enroute,having a minor accident with a squabbling married couple. His dedication to his science has cut him off from the spontaneous springs of innocence,love and happiness. The symbolism is not heavy-handed,it meshes beautifully in with the past,the present and the future of his life. Bibi Andersson plays both his early love Sara,who he loses through his coldness, and one of the young hitch-hikers on their way to Italy. The black and white filmography is a superbly executed achieve- ment. The dialogue has Dickensian power,the narrative is like a beautiful jewel, that glimmers,the dream sequences are expressive and surrealistic. All the characters are working, from his cold dowager mother to Von Sydow as a garage mechanic.",1272326400,2,1527,5.393305439330544
3489956,5,B001BEK8EC,"Ingmar Bergman's ""Wild Strawberries"" (1957) follows the memories of an elderly man reminiscing about his life. Dreams, nightmares and flashbacks haunt this man as we learn about his romantic failures, and his desire to return to childhood. It is a study of old age as well as a moral inquiry into a man's life choices. This is a thoughtful film that offers us the time to reflect on the choices we make in life.",1259625600,,411,4.5675675675675675
3489957,5,B001BEK8EC,"When I watched this film when I was young, I did not like it. I thought it was too stark, too melancholy, too dark.  When you are young the world is more of a technicolor place and perhaps we are all unwilling to let the dark clouds into it.  I resaw this film when I was in my 50s and my reaction was much different.  There is a melancholy yet bittersweet quality to this film, almost a dreamlike glide through the corridors of memory and time.  For it is an old person who will die sooner, rather than later, who is looking back on his whole life and his memories as well as winding up his life as it exists in the present. Everyone who has made it to an older age will recognize the territory of the film at once as very, very familiar.  It is a Swedish professor who we watch on this journey.  His relationships in life have been turbulent but not out of the ordinary.  It is a beautiful film, one of Bergman's very best and he didn't make any duds.

3489958,5,B001BEK8EC,"Wild Strawberries is an excellent display of the broad spectrum of human emotion.  At first glance an immediate disdain is inspired by the main character, until the story unfolds revealing the source of his callousness.  By the end I felt nothing but a profound sense of empathy and compassion.  Bergman has quickly become one of my favorite directors, and in my opinion,  this film is among his best.",1247270400,7,401,4.852941176470588
3489959,5,B001BEK8EC,"After half a century, WILD STRAWBERRIES yet glimmers in these darkling days. A meditation on old age, selfishness, duty, love, and reconciliation, the film traces the last days of a respected but unloving physician (played by the elderly, frail, great Victor Sjostram, who passed away during the making of the film [in the 1920s he had starred in the daunting silent THE OUTLAW AND HIS WIFE, set in Iceland]). The main character undertakes a journey by car with his daughter-in-law to receive an honorary degree from Alma Mater. On the way he adopts three college students and a snarling, embittered married couple. He visits his very very elderly and very cold mother--and always there are visions of the sorrows, regrets, and bitternesses of his past. At the film's luminescent close the doctor at last casts off ancient recriminations to achieve a peaceful repose lulled by a shimmering scene from long ago with Mother and Father in happy tableau. One of cinema's outstanding achievemnts. But I too am an old man.",1238112000,26,1016,4.982352941176471

8282825,4,B001BEK8EC,"I hadn't seen this for fifty years or so, and didn't like it so much this time as I did before.  Looking at it as an old man rather than a younger one changed my perspective, I expect.  However, the print is the usual superb Criterion quality, and if you don't need commentary and want to try the film again for yourself, I doubt that you could do better than this edition.",1428710400,,373,4.166666666666667

8282828,5,B001BEK8EC,"This is wonderful movie by Ingmar Bergman, really a ""must-see"".

Why? World-class actresses, meaningful scenario, interesting influence of the surralism movement (cf. ""Chien Andalou"")...",1387756800,,186,6.75
8282829,4,B001BEK8EC,Nicely remastered and subtitled - would have liked more supplementary material -  the movie stands on its own and this is a worthy,1375401600,,130,4.6521739130434785
8282830,5,B001BEK8EC,"I wish I'd seen when I was younger, but I feel that way about most things I enjoy for the first time. The kind of movie that pops back into my mind at the oddest times. About the end-game of life, but I think pertinent to all generations(I'm kinda old) A master director at work, and a ""foundation film"" for many directors today. Sub-titled, but they last long enough to read. Relevant to all cultures on many levels. Slow at times, but worth the time. My mid-20's daughter enjoyed it also.",1360540800,,490,4.395604395604396
8282831,4,B001BEK8EC,"An old doctor (a magnificent performance by Victor Sjostrom) takes a
car trip to receive an award for 50 years in medicine, accompanied by
his daughter in law, and some teenage hitchhikers they pick up.

He is tormented by highly symbolic dreams (beautifully done), and by
the realization he has kept himself at an emotional distance from
others and the world, and now his life is racing towards it's end.

Quite moving in spots, but somehow never ended up with as much power as
I expected.

Two critics' notes made sense to me. One said that, for as great and
transparent as Sjostrom's performance is, he is so sweet and likable a
presence it's hard to reconcile him with a man his daughter in law
openly admits she doesn't like because of his cold nature.

The other point - which could also be applied to 'The Seventh Seal' is
that the film seems less special today because the stylistic barriers
it broke and the doors it opened (an almost totally subjective film,
dream sequences of depth and meaning, etc) have since become a familiar
part of film grammar. But at the time, this was something new and
brave. Another to re-see.

Note: This transfer is the same as the excellent and more expensive
Criterion transfer, but with fewer extra features.  If your interest
is in great film quality and not the extras, this is a good deal.",1334620800,7,1336,4.616033755274262
8282832,5,B001BEK8EC,"Seventy-eight year old Isak Borg journeys on his way to receive an honorary degree for his professional work. He travels in his own car accompanied by his daughter-in-law. Also he is joined by a young trio composed by two men and a woman. Throughout the film, Isak struggles with fears of loneliness and the possibility that his life has been a waste. He suffers a dream with surrealistic characteristics, where his own death in life is illustrated thru the use of handless clocks, empty streets, ruins, and faceless bodies. Through the journey we also discover his strenuous relationships with his son, daughter-in-law, and with his wife. He has dreams and reminiscences of the past that communicate to us the things that really have meaning in life. Basically, it is the tale of a person who has succeeded as a professional, but has failed as father and husband, and he discovers at the end that the price to pay for this negligence is loneliness. Isak, however, does not want to remain alone and makes attempts to amend for this hollow past.

The film shows surrealistic images to dramatize Isak's existential crisis. It also contrasts an idyllic (pastoral) past with a modern middle-class life. We also get to see the lack of faith and hope in Isak and his son's life. The distinction between middle-class culture and the innocence of a rural, agrarian society can be seen in the rivalry between Isak, concerned about sin and doing the right thing, and his brother, who is passionate and incorrigible. Sara, Isak's love, stands between the two. Sara marries Isak's brother and leads a fruitful life having many children. On the other hand, Isak has been the head of a dysfunctional family. Thus, Isak must confront this past in his present struggle to find meaning in his life.

This Essential Art House edition is an excellent presentation of the film. If you like this type of film, or if you are a Bergman fan, then you will enjoy this edition.",1307923200,,1951,4.803571428571429
