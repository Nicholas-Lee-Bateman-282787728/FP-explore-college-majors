8338642,4,B001RQQ7JE,"This film is made by Ceskoslovensky Filmexport, and Short Film Prague Gottwaldov Group, directed by Karel Zeman back in 1974 as part of a series in Czechoslovakia. It is slow and uses cut out animation to tell a series of adventures about Sinbad. They had been released individually in Czechoslovakia and were gathered together as a feature. As far as I know it was only shown in Czechoslovakia in the theatres. The VHS U.S. version is Lightning Video (Stamford, Connecticut). There is no US theatrical distributor. I would say that it is a trial to watch, but perhaps a two year old would like. The animation is of the type used in the 19th century, using cut-outs to tell a story, with virtually no movement. I would not recommend it for those who want modern CGI or flashy cell animation. It could work as an art film, but these days most fans of animation would not put up with it. There are some things I would like to add. The box has The Adventures of Sinbad the Sailor, but the actual tape has Adventures of Sindbad the Sailor. The production companies are Kratky Film Prague and Filmov Studio Gottwoldov. The Czech theatrical distributor is Ustredni Pujcovna Filmu and Ceskoslovensky Filmexport. (This is according to Internet Movie Database. It was originally 6 independent shorts later edited together. The original Czech title is Pohadky tisice a jedne waci, also known as Tales of 1001 Nights, or Sindbad. And, ZIV International has nothing to do with this film. The film is also in Amazon catalog as Adventures of Sinbad, with Lightning Video as label. These are the same movies.",1393200000,,1593,4.77536231884058
