8026303,3,B0002CU2TK,"A lot of the ""best"" matches appear to be chosen solely due to the name recognition of the combatants, rather than actually being high quality matches. Some of the fights are great. Some of them have fighters you know circling each other for 15 minutes with little contact and fewer takedowns.

There is no commentary at all. Not even before or after the matches. These are live recordings hastily put together. Matches will sometimes inexplicably cut out, and come back after several seconds of black screen, with no way to tell how much was missed. Presumably a camera stopped working. Or the cameraman hit the off button. It's hard to tell.

This might have been filmed with a Handycam.

Nonetheless, this is the ADCC, and if you're interested in top level submission wrestling, this is about the only way you're going to get your fix.",1352332800,,837,4.758620689655173
8026304,3,B0002CU2TK,"Not a bad production... The Arona fight was cool to watch... not to mention the never before seen footage of Eddie Bravo backstage... also that I learned a new escape from the half guard LOL...

All in all not bad... and I bought this new for 10.25 so I really cant complain....",1231200000,,278,4.346153846153846
8026305,3,B0002CU2TK,"I bought this for the Royler vs. Joao Roque match and, to that extent, I  was not disappointed. Everything else left me feeling a bit cheated; specifically, as was previously mentioned, the quality of the production.",1199750400,,216,5.0
8026306,2,B0002CU2TK,"I was surprised at how boring much of the dvd turned out to be.  Also, the behind the scenes material was amateurish.

Jean Jac Machado looked great.  That's one thing I can say for the dvd.  I am a big fan of Renzo Gracie but I didn't see much here.  I really can't recommend this dvd.",1129248000,3,286,4.035714285714286
8026307,3,B0002CU2TK,"This first side of this DVD contains several fights from the earlier Abu Dhabi events.  Royler vs. Joao Roque is an excellent match.  Jean Jaques Machado vs. Caol Uno is also really fun to watch.  Ricardo Arona vs. Kareem Barkaleev is crazy.  Other matches aren't quite as interesting, but still pretty good.

The other side of the DVD contains about 40 minutes of 'behind the scenes' footage from the 2003 Abu Dhabi event (in Brazil).  It's kind of cool to watch, but could be edited and presented much better.

If you have the other two Best of ADCC DVDs, you'll know what to expect from this one.  If not, get the other two first ...",1097539200,9,636,4.469565217391304
