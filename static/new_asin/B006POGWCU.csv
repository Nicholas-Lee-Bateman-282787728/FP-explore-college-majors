The movie was so well done with excellent acting and thoughtful layers of the depiction of the reality of refugees.  It's amazing how deep the movie goes with such a simple look at the issues.  I will never forget this movie.",1505520000,,387,4.579710144927536

8502853,5,B006POGWCU,"This is a film not to be missed.  It tackles the complexities of a current world problem with raw realism while never sacrificing sensitivity. The acting is superb and the story flows smoothly within its main plot and subplots.  I was thoroughly engaged throughout and did not find the subtitling distracting.  In fact, subtitles are kept to a minimum because the actors communicate so effectively through tone, body and especially facial expression. The back drop of the movie's setting is a lovely, unspoiled island and the scenery provides a visual feast for the viewers.  You will want to have a conversation about it when the movie is done.  Highly recommended.",1464048000,2,666,5.0181818181818185

8502858,4,B006POGWCU,"Set on the very small Sicilian island of Lampedusa we meet Ernesto (Mimmo Cuticchio - Baaria) who is one of the last men making a living out of fishing the ever depleted waters of the Mediterranean. He is accompanied by his grandson Filippo - played by Filippo Pucillo Respiro. The boat is rotting and would be worth more being broken up but Ernesto is a traditionalist. Meanwhile Fillipos mother decides that they need to cash in on the tourist trade that is helping keep the island alive.

Mother, Giulietta played beautifully by Donatella Finocchiaro (On the way home and Baaria) does up their home and moves into the garage. Then on a last fishing trip Ernesto and Filippo come across a boat of illegal immigrants that have sailed from Africa. The boat is dangerously over loaded and some of the people jump in the water to try to access Ernestos boat. Under a controversial Italian law it is illegal to aid illegals. Ernesto though is made of sterner stuff and the law of the sea says you do not leave someone to their fate. He rescues a pregnant mother and her young boy.  The consequences of his actions will bring repercussions that will come to affect the whole island.

This is from director Emanuele Crialese who has brought us Golden Door and Respiro, he has an eye for a camera angle and presents us here with both a scintillating story and a visual treat. Some of the scenes having a symmetry and poise that belies how hard it must have been to direct such interesting shots. He also delves into the collective consciousness of a people faced with doing what goes against their natural instincts and a country that is finding it increasingly hard to cope with the influx of illegal immigration. We also have the stark juxta- positioning of the luxury seeking tourist and the desperation of the immigrants and the comparative poverty of the islanders in contrast to those same tourists.

In Italian, Sicilian and Amharic with good sub titles, with excellent performances all round and a run time of 90 minutes make for an excellent film that has a lot more going for it than being merely entertaining recommended.",1389744000,3,2126,4.706989247311828
8502859,4,B006POGWCU,"Set in todays Linosa Island, the second largest island of the Pelagie Islands that are located in the Mediterranean Sea (far south of the mainland of Italy), Emanuele Crialeses drama Mainland (Terraferma) follows the life of a young local Filippo (Filippo Pucillo), 20-year-old son of a struggling family.

While his grandfather, 70-year-old fisherman Ernesto (Mimmo Cuticchio) sticks to the traditional way of life, his uncle Nino (Giuseppe Fiorello) has turned to tourism, and his mother Giulietta (Donatella Finocchiaro), who really wants to leave the island and starts a new life elsewhere, rents out rooms for three travelers from the northern Italy, including a young and beautiful girl Maura (Martina Codecasa).

Then a certain event happens. While out at the seas, Filippo and his grandfather save illegal immigrants from Africa including an Ethiopian named Sara (Timnit T.) and her son, and hide them from the authorities. What his family is doing is against the law, Filippo learns, while his grandfather believes it is his duty to save their lives.

While the film tackles modern-day Italys social reality including North-South divide and migration (Timnit T. playing Sara is a real-life immigrant who survived the travel), the film also attempts to be a coming-of-age drama about growing pains by following the changes that happen inside Filippo.

The films main theme involves several social issues; however, Mainland in fact works most effectively as a drama of a young man who has to make his decision on his own, and his family members whose values are severely tested in the face of reality.",1385078400,3,1608,5.22093023255814
8502860,4,B006POGWCU,"""Terraferma"" (2011 release from Italy); 90 min.) brings the story of a community on a small Italian island that is heavily dependent on tourism and fishing for its economic well-being/survival. As the movie opens, we get to know a family, from the old man/granpa Ernesto down to his daughter-in-law/widow Giulietta (we later learn that Ernesto's son disappeared at seas 3 years ago), and to her 20 yr. old son Filippo. The island is getting ready for the upcoming all-important 2 month tourist season, and the family decides to rent out their house to make some extra money. Then one day out at sea, Ernesto and Filippo run into a raft full of boat people from Africa. About 6 or 7 of them jump into the water and swim towards Ernesto's boat. Despite clear instructions from the Italian Coast Guard not to help, Ernesto takes them onto his boat. At this point we are only 30 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would ruin your viewing experience. You'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, this is a poignant family drama, focusing both on the harsh conditions of the small Italian community on that island, and the even harsher realities of the boat people trying to make it to Europe at all cost. While I am no ""advocate"" of illegal immigration, you can't help but feel sorry for these boat people. In particular the background story of the high-pregnant monther who gives birth to a baby only hours after being rescued from the water, will hit you hard. Second, the movie pits the moral dilemma of the Italian community very clearly. Ernesto (who lost a son at sea) explains to Filippo that, according to the laws of the sea, nobody is ever left behind out in the open waters, regardless of the circumstances. Yet the laws of man are equally clear: to aid and abet illegal immigrants is a crime. What will the family do? Third, the photography of this movie is nothing short of visually outstanding and gorgeous. (This movie won the ""best photography"" award at the 2011 Venice film festival, we are informed dueing the opening credits.) The movie was filmed entirely on Linosa, a very small island roughly half-way between Lybia and Italy. Last but certainly not least, I will admit that I didn't recognize any of the actors and actresses, but the acting performances are ace throughout, none more so that the old man portraying Ernesto.

Imagine my surprise when this movie, which is now 2 years old, showed up unannounced and without any pre-release hype or advertizing at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati last weekend. I figured this wouldn't be playing long (I was right, it's already gone after only 1 week), so I went to see it a few days ago. So glad I did. ""Terraferma"" is an emotional but poignant family drama that will not leave you unmoved. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie that is miles away from your standard Hollywood fare, you cannot go wrong with this. ""Terraferma"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

*UPDATE* (Oct' 13) The recent tragedy in Italy just drives home the point of this movie, and makes this an even more must-see movie than ever.",1379635200,7,3145,4.6732851985559565
