8078370,5,B00004SYVM,"I've seen this video and wish I could have viewed it when I was applying to colleges.  It's practical, involving and filled with really good information.  It follows the stories of two very different high school seniors through their application process & its results and intercuts that with brief interviews with heads of admissions from a variety of colleges.  If they're not giving the inside scoop on what to do and what they're looking for, who can you go to? This video is well worth the time and money, considering the trouble and expense of going to college.",1060732800,2,566,4.755102040816326
