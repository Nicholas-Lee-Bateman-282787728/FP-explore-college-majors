5681898,4,B00BY8DLSA,"Ths plot frame for this 1953 technicolor musical is the career of the wild girl of the early 20th century, singer Eva Tanguay, seen from the perspective of more than one supposed witness.  The screenplay doesn't always make a lot of sense and is full of the sort howling anachronisms typical in period films of the time...not to mention that Eva's Sybaritic life is squeezed into the prim corset of the Hays Code, still in effect through 1968.  Despite all this, Mitzi Gaynor was the perfect choice for the role, fitting right in with all the manically sexy choreography and over-the-top costumes--for the latter of which, at least, the real Eva was notorious.
The meat of this movie is not the bogus biography but rather Mitzi's incredible talent. In general, she is the true triple threat -- dancing, singing, and acting -- but, above all, on the musical stage she is a pure genius.  In every one of the five or so big numbers she does, she exhibits a different style appropriate to the feeling and spirit of the music and the choreography. This is comparable to the ""variations"" we see in ballet, in each of which different movements are used to create a unique set of impressions. In her first ""I Don't Care!"" number she really is like a wild woman who might do just about anything...and then she does!  Low and behold she starts climbing across the theater architecture into the boxes, kicking hats out of hands and shaking her wonderful feathers and anatomy in various faces.  In the Pretty Baby number she is right out of 1910, making the old vaudville moves as if she'd been doing them all her life.  In the ""Beale Street Rag,"" with which the film ends (look closely and you'll see Julie Newmar in the chorus!), Mitzi is, by contrast, a totally-in-control absolutley fabulous hypervamp. There's also a number combining a Bach fugue with jazz and poofy Renaissance costumes and fast-paced, often Italian nonsense lyrics that will knock your socks off.  I didn't even know they were doing things like that already in 1953! Also Oscar Levant does a lot of almost equally manic piano playing, mostly classical but all extremely exciting...as if Mitzi's acts weren't exciting enough!
In short, the only Mitzi Gaynor stage numbers I've seen that rival what's here are in the magnificent ""Bloodhounds of Broadway.""",1366848000,18,2315,4.816120906801007
5681899,5,B00BY8DLSA,"Must have been a real bore until Jack Cole was called in to stage 3 numbers for the great Mitzi Gaynor. Too bad there are no chapter stops just for these show stoppers.  Mitzi says that these are her favorite routines. It`s a shame that they stopped giving Oscars for dance in the late 30`s. These would certainly have been nominated. I never get tired of watching ""The Johnson Rag"", ""I Don`t Care"" and ""Beale Street Blues"". Fox has done a good job with this, but they could have removed the fallen feathers in ""I Don`t Care"".",1366761600,10,526,4.422680412371134
5681900,3,B00BY8DLSA,"FOX really wasted Mitzi Gaynor and put her in one mediocre vehicle after another. THE I DON'T CARE GIRL is no exception.  Loosely based on the life of entertainer Eva Tanguay, which purports to tell her story via flashbacks a la RASHOMON.  The film suffers from very poor editing where some scenes never make sense. David Wayne appears and disappears and then reappears in the film.  There are some fabulous musical numbers mostly choreographed by Jack Cole. Look for Gwen Verdon in one of these numbers.  As with other  FOX MOD's the color is erratic.  At times it looks quite beautiful and at other time seems like too much red.  This one is for Gaynor fans only.",1366761600,12,665,4.632478632478633

5681912,3,B00BY8DLSA,"Take a burlesque girl and try to put her on Broadway?  Yuck.  Mitzi doesn't have the class to pull this one off.  The staging, costumes, scenery don't help what whit.  Of course, span and scan doesn't help either.",1402790400,,213,4.526315789473684
5681913,5,B00BY8DLSA,Marvelously happy with this product.  Gaynor had so much wonderful appeal...indeed the lady had so many grand talents.  This is a fabulous film work.,1402185600,,149,5.166666666666667
5681914,4,B00BY8DLSA,"I am stunned to admit how much I like this movie. It has (virtually) nothing to do with the life of Eva Tanguay, and it illustrated how little 20th Century Fox and George Jessel cared about plot, continuity or color balance.

It's a 1950's B color musical about ...writing a script about the life of Eva Tanguay, which serves to present George Jessel in his role as the musical producer on the Fox lot for Darryl Zanuck. As an artifact of a string of forgotten titles, it tells us a lot more about Jessel than Tanguay.  What makes it memorable is the dance sequences, with some wild work by Jack Cole and Seymour Felix as choreographers. The title number is a melange of all the really bad/wonderful 'dream ballets' of the  1950's (think Bandwagon or American in Paris) only with a really small budget and little regard to dancers' safety. The rest of it is a tried and true backstage biography, every cliche included.

I have wanted to see this film for so long, I am stunned at how much I really enjoyed it. It has no right to be any good at all. Special mention to David Wayne and Oscar Levant, who get bigger than normal parts in the story.

A time capsule of 1950's movie studio thinking (every cliche included again).  Much more charming than you'd think.",1384560000,5,1261,4.4847161572052405
5681915,2,B00BY8DLSA,I remember seeing this when the film was first released but had forgotten how bad the plot was.  George Jessell produced and appeared in it.  The opening scene had no relevance and the ending woefull.  Mitzi Gaynor did her best but a couple of the dance routines were terrible.,1380672000,,277,4.612244897959184
5681916,5,B00BY8DLSA,"Have been wishing for a long time for this movie to become available.  One of my favorite Mitzi Gaynor movies.  This was the the 3rd movie she made, I believe and anything she did, I love.",1379548800,,188,4.194444444444445
5681917,2,B00BY8DLSA,"All the way through this film, I kept saying, ""If only it had been done at M-G-M!""  But, this biography of singing star Eva Tanguay was done by Fox and the results are dismal.  I love musicals featuring the songs from the turn of the century but this one doesn't even have many of those.  The story is disjointed because it is told from the viewpoint of several different characters.  Mitzi Gaynor does what she can with the material but I kept wondering what the likes of Doris Day, June Haver or Betty Grable would have done with this film.  The choreography which is supposed to show dances from the 1900's looks like it was done by Michael Kidd or Bob Fosse with wild gyrations, screaming jazz music and flashy costumes.  I'd like to say something positive about this film but the whole concept seems to have been a bad idea from beginning to end.",1376092800,2,851,4.458064516129032
5681918,4,B00BY8DLSA,"Miss Gayor is Great !.. it's the story line, that is weak.. all in all...this is a film any person who loves broadway, and great dacing will enjoy... seems...?  Hollywood did not see the talents in Mitzi... she should have been given more... she would have Dazzled !!!!!",1371081600,,270,4.625
5681919,4,B00BY8DLSA,"While the storyline seems to be stitched together (haphazardly) it doesn't impact the importance of finally having this film on DVD.
The real star of the show is choreographer Jack Cole, and that, in itself, is reason enough to buy this DVD. Mitzi Gaynor is wonderful doing Cole's steps, and kudos to Fox for releasing this near-forgotten film.",1369872000,,344,4.948275862068965
5681920,1,B00BY8DLSA,"This has to be one of Fox's worse musicals. Supposedly the life of Ziegfeld star Eva Tanguay, it is doubtful if one moment of this film is about her life. I guess they needed to build a story, so they made up a horrible concept. It has the worse script and costumes of any Fox musical. And it shows the absolute no talent of Mitzi Gaynor in the acting category. The one brief Ziegfeld number is laughable, especially when Mitzi jumps in a pool of water with her solid feather costume and is pulled out with not one feather droopy or wet. Gimme a break! I gave it one star because of the brief moment of the Fabulous Gwen Verdon doing a brief dance number. Boring and stupid.",1367020800,2,674,4.2734375
8575371,2,B00BY8DLSA,One of the weakest Fox musicals -  corny and Mitzi is too young to carry the lead as Eva Tanguay - the first version of the title song is great but overall a poor film .,1497052800,,169,3.6944444444444446
8575372,4,B00BY8DLSA,"I liked this.  Could all this have been done on a Bway stage?  Or an orchestra in Oscar Levant's apartment.  Everything I thought was well done.  I liked Mitzi Gaynor's dancing, but I thought her acting and singing were pretty light weight.  The same as in South Pacific and There's No Business Like Show Business.",1486944000,,314,4.636363636363637
8575373,3,B00BY8DLSA,"Singer, actor, Bob Graham was wonderful to
watch and to listen to. Mitzi Gaynor never made
a movie I didn't like. This movie was a period piece, ""B"" movie, with a thin script and a low budget. Watch it for the talented performers and the music & dance which they produced.",1485475200,,272,4.352941176470588

8575375,2,B00BY8DLSA,"I'm sorry to have to agree with the negative reviews of this film. I love Mitzi Gaynor, but in this movie she is poorly directed and choreographed. For example, her ability to show anger or hurt is to shout with a dead looking expression---high school play level. When she's happy, she gives us the dance-number smiling face, and that's it. Even singing the words ""I don't care,"" she lacks any liveliness of tone and timing.  Compare her performance here to the one in Les Girls. In the latter she is much more alive and varied in her expressions under director George Cukor. As for the choreography, she doesn't do much in any of the numbers but prance around on those cute legs and shake her voluminous skirts. Hardly any variety of steps and body language. The songs, also, are fifth rate, and the lead singer has a foggy uninteresting voice. If you want to see how good this girl was, check out her ""It's De-lovely"" routine with Donald O'Connor in Anything Goes.  But sadly, I'd suggest you skip IDCG. . . unless you like Oscar Levant who does some excellent piano work, as usual. All in all,  Mitzi deserved better, dang it!",1446076800,,1129,4.579207920792079
8575376,5,B00BY8DLSA,"Its old and great and a musical. Mitzi Gaynor could do it all, most likely sort of , ha ha , based on a real ladies life. Mitzi is much prettier the the original. The title of the show was the name of a song wrote for her.",1446076800,,222,3.6458333333333335
