7867508,4,6304296150,I wish someone would digitize this for sale or release the DVD. It's a great movie from the 90s.,1519171200,,96,4.105263157894737
7867509,4,6304296150,"I loved this movie as a teen. Haven't seen it In over a decade, since it's not on dvd? Anyway, if anyone's still buying vhs, this is a great movie to watch as a younger woman, it's all about sisterhood and standing up for yourself, but its a much more real depiction of those themes than you'll see in any glossy Hollywood attempt at the same type of story.",1394150400,,357,4.188405797101449
7867510,5,6304296150,"The plot is superb and an excellent casting job was done to make this dramatic real-life film about girls who are about to complete high school...but need to deal with adult-type problems as well.

I have been wanting this movie on DVD for a LONG time!  If anyone knows of a place where I can get this film on DVD, please let me know!!!  Thanks.",1377475200,,345,4.276923076923077
7867511,4,6304296150,"""Girls Town"" is a movie I have wanted to see for a minute and a half.  At one time it was hard to find, Thank GOD I was able to find on Amazon.  I waited patiently and it paid off.  Such a good movie with a story line that never gets stale.  Great chemistry between the ""girls"".  And, currently, I'm all about my girl Lili Taylor.  She seldom disappoints.  She has an actors face and an actors attitude.  She melts into whatever role she is given.  She is definitely in the right profession.  ""Girls Town"" makes you want to see what more she can do.  Extremely diverse actress.  It's all about those eyes.  She sells it all day.",1338163200,,628,4.220338983050848
7867512,5,6304296150,"I seen this movie when I was younger and was quite impressed with the story as well as the acting. The movie proves you don't need some huge Hollywood budget to pull off a good picture.

The directing reminds you a lot of those 3PM teen movie specials on PBS, but it still works. I found the story to be more realistic in the times we live in today with teen girls. The movie addresses issues on rape, teen motherhood, pressure in and out of school, dating issues and self-worth. The plotting with the initial story is quite simple and builds with each scene.  It does have a bit of a feminist tone without the characters not saying they are, so if you don't like anything about feminism, than I don't know if you I'd advice you to watch this.  Overall still a really good movie for the most part.

The only thing I hate -- THIS FILM ISN'T IN DVD PRINT -- come on Universal Studios give me Girls Town DVD.

Nevertheless happy watching to those who get to watch this picture.",1293321600,2,974,4.300546448087432
7867513,5,6304296150,"I saw this movie in the theaters when it first came out.  I'm a huge fan of Lilly Taylor who gives a great performance, along with the other actresses.  This has to be the most realistic portrayal of date rape during adolescence I have ever seen.  Unlike a lot of movies that sensationalize rape to the point of bordering on soft porn, this movie skips the graphic details and gets straight to the business of empowering its female characters.  Warning: this movie is dangerous to the dominate power structure, which is probably why you can't rent it at Blockbuster...",1218412800,2,568,4.707070707070707
7867514,5,6304296150,"One of my favorite movies of all time.  Lili Tayor is excellent, as are the rest of the cast.  Movie was largely unscripted, and the women made a lot of the dialogue up as they went along.  Really rings true to experience.",1213315200,,222,4.238095238095238
7867515,5,6304296150,"This is One of my Favoirte movies, next to just another girl, the players club, and eves bayou... It shows that we women are strong, and we ain't gonna take no stuff from no man... No disrespect...",971049600,3,197,4.351351351351352
