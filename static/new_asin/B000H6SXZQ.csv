2630137,5,B000H6SXZQ,"I was told about Men behaving badly. At first I thought it was going to be stupid due to it being a british made comedy. However I gave it a try anyway it is so funny, it's one of those shows you just laugh and laugh. It's great ""Men Behaving badly""",1294444800,,249,3.9019607843137254
2630138,5,B000H6SXZQ,"This is a hilarious English TV show about 2 roommates and their ""loves"". The laughs are plentiful, the humor spot-on and it's just plain fun comedy. Trust me you will love this show if you give it a chance and you like to laugh.",1252108800,2,228,4.204545454545454
2630139,5,B000H6SXZQ,"this 6 season series of men behaving badly is a masterpiece. 2 male flatmates living on the level floor, while 2 female flatmates live on the 2nd floor makes for a laugh out loud series.. I have watched this show on the BBC channel for years and never came close to getting bored with it.  Now i have in my possession the complete seasons on dvd, and couldn't be more thrilled.. I always find myself throwing in a season on dvd and watching and enjoying.  I also turned my friends onto this series, as they never even knew this show existed. Its a must watch and must buy comedy series, britsh style.",1232236800,9,600,4.348214285714286
2630140,4,B000H6SXZQ,"I do love this series, but I did feel a little disappointed when I purchased the whole box set to find out that the best episode of all, ""Jingle Balls"" was not included with this, and still has not been released on DVD outside of U.K/Europe.

I guess it might be because BBC Warner don't own the rights to it, but it is  a must if you purchase the ALMOST complete box set.",1209859200,11,372,4.082191780821918
2630141,5,B000H6SXZQ,"These shows get progressively better through the seasons.  Funny, sophmoric, and battle of the sexes humor.  Perfect antidote for a light laugh.  The show is about two men but the humor, as long as you're not too proud, works for women too.  Open a lager and enjoy.",1201564800,5,265,4.574468085106383
2630142,5,B000H6SXZQ,"I love all Brit comedy and this one was a definite ""must have"" for my dvd library. If you love raunchy comedy then this is one that you will need to be on your list, along with ""Are You Being Served?"".  This show will leave you with sore cheeks from laughing (and possibly p**ing your pants,too!) but it is so worth it! If you are not familiar with Brit com, then maybe you should start with ""Served"", but this one should be next on your list.",1175817600,6,443,4.151162790697675

8137185,1,B000H6SXZQ,It was ok. Martin clunes is not funny as gary. Tony on there was anoying. The American version was really funny,1388275200,,111,4.333333333333333
8137186,5,B000H6SXZQ,"This costs less than the region 1 version and it has all of the episodes, including the holiday episode.  The case does not take up too much room on the shelf.",1386892800,,159,4.129032258064516
8137187,5,B000H6SXZQ,"Oh the nineties...bad hair, laughable clothes and judging by this sitcom, very tolerable women...great times and this is a great slice of tv from that era. Highly recommended.",1374796800,2,175,5.285714285714286
8137188,4,B000H6SXZQ,"I loved Martin Clunes in ""Doc Martin"" so I purchased this series to see what he was like in his other roles.  In this series, his character is totally opposite the man he plays in ""Doc Martin"". The first season was okay, but it gets funnier and more addicting as the seasons progress.  The show is about two roommates and two girls they are pursuing, although being men, they are in self-denial about their emotions.  The series is set from the man's point of view which is oftentimes quite disgustingly funny, but if you want to see life from a single man's point of view without censorship, you really have to watch it.",1329004800,,621,4.477876106194691
8137189,5,B000H6SXZQ,One of the funniest series I've seen that has come out of the UK. I just discovered the series although it's been around a few years. Martin Clunes is absolutely brilliant and the rest of the cast- tops as well! He has just developed into an actor I want to watch in anything he chooses to do - because it is going to knock your socks off.,1303776000,,339,4.074626865671642
8137190,1,B000H6SXZQ,"We are great fans of Martin Clunes and own all seasons of Doc Martin. This earlier TV series is pretty bad and we struggle to get through every episode. While Martin Clunes is outstanding in other shows and productions, his Doc Martin character would rather drink a bottle of blood than to suffer through this bad TV series.
How do we hate you? Let me count the ways: 1. Crude, off-color sexual and toilet humor 2. Boring episodes 3. Weak characters 4. Poor writing 5. Low quality production videos. etc, etc.
There are no subtitles and sound quality is so poor it is difficult to hear their low-class, tastless jokes. It is imporssible to fast forward to the beginning of each show, you must see all the previews and titles before the show starts. Then if you make the mistake of going back to the episode or main menu, you have to start all over again sequencing through all the introductory material and titles.
How he got better roles later in life is a mystery as this should have been a career-ender.",1299715200,2,1006,4.532967032967033
