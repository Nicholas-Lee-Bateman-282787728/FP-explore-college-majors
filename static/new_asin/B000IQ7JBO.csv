8147220,5,B000IQ7JBO,"The two DVDs have over 3 hours of history.  From films made for the public about fallout, to films shown to soldiers about management of casualties.  Nuclear radiation, nuclear weapons, and nuclear explosions, oh my!  One of the shorts is even based on the book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Survival-Under-Atomic-Attack/dp/B000KVJZYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Survival Under Atomic Attack</a>.  That's right it even has the same title!
This stuff is the stuff of nightmares.  Sure, there are some funny moments.  But those are totally by accident and only funny after decades of time.  Much of the films are about trying to make the American public feel that they are capable of surviving a atomic attack.  And if they refuse to prepare for it, if they refuse to do their part, well than, their just plain traitors.  No, really, one of the shorts is called Our Cities Must Fight.  They basically try to shame you into fighting for your nation.  Wonderful Cold War stuff that makes you wonder in what way were we superior to the Soviet Union.  I mean, really, some of the shorts could be looked right as outright lies.  They show people surviving a nuclear exchange in their basement and others walking about outside AFTER the missiles have hit.
It would be funny if it were not for the fact that these shorts were shown in schools, city halls, and on TV.  Day Called X, for example, was shown on TV, a warning against a city being unprepared.  How one would be prepared for a bunch of missiles raining down onto the city without warning, I don't know.  Any plans made to deal with such a event would quickly become outdated as missiles become more powerful and both nations developed faster and more effective delivery systems.  But I'm off track...
These shorts are horrible.  Why the five stars?  Because I don't mean horrible in a quality kind of way.  I just mean horrible in how they show us in such a bad light.  You need to buy this set.  Why?  Because this set of DVDs are honest, important for our understanding of our past, and in some ways I find truly them enjoyable in a way.  I love history.  And, good or bad, I feel the need to learn as much of it as I can.
After watching this set, after taking a nap with a teddy bear, may I also suggest reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Nation-Underground-The-Fallout-Shelter-in-American-Culture-American-History-and-Culture/dp/0814775233/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Nation Underground: The Fallout Shelter in American Culture (American History and Culture)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallout-Shelter-Designing-for-Civil-Defense-in-the-Cold-War-Architecture-Landscape-and-Amer-Culture/dp/0816669767/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallout Shelter: Designing for Civil Defense in the Cold War (Architecture, Landscape and Amer Culture)</a>&nbsp;to increase your horror.
