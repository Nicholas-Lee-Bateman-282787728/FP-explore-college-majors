8166395,4,B000M5ALH0,"This is an interesting film that is filled with many clips of the battle that I had never seen before.  It was well done and I enjoyed it and learned alot of new information.  However, I gave it only 4stars as it is not full of all the things that most people enjoy and would be slow to the average person.  However if you are a war buff and enjoy war trivia you will really like this film, as I did, as it is well done and explained in great detail.",1396915200,5,450,3.923076923076923
8166396,5,B000M5ALH0,"There are 3 parts to this series and they're all well done.  If you're interested in first person accounts of the battle, you will thoroughly enjoy this series.  Excellent.",1327017600,,172,4.896551724137931
8166397,3,B000M5ALH0,"The interviews on this dvd are undeniably captivating & very professionally done but $10 for ""48min"" of footage seems pretty steep and considering the 2nd and 3rd DVD'S are the same length and sell for $17 ""apiece"" this whole series, approximately 144 min of footage seems rather overpriced. Consider you can get the entire 11 disc ""World At War"" series, 1357 minutes, nearly 24 hours of footage for the same $40. Buyer be aware.",1201651200,7,429,4.8108108108108105
8166398,5,B000M5ALH0,"As someone who has an interest in World War 2 and has had very little information from a German perspective on Stalingrad I found the series very informative. It was not what I thought it would be, it was about those who were at Stalingrad and returned to Germany. No matter what you think of the Germans under Hitler this is the story of men who went to Hell and back.",1181001600,10,369,4.211267605633803
