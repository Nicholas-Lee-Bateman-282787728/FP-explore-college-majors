2922284,5,B000UL61DY,"My brother in law (one of the biggest Yankees fans in the history of the Yankees, I think) was SO excited to receive this as a Christmas gift. He said that it has great info on it and he's really happy with it. I'm not sure exactly what all is on it, but if it made him happy, I'm sure it'd make other Yankee fans happy!",1239753600,,320,3.8636363636363638
2922285,4,B000UL61DY,I ordered this as a Christmas gift and it arrived very quickly-I think it will be a great present!,1230076800,,98,4.2105263157894735
2922286,5,B000UL61DY,If you enjoy the Yankees and or baseball altogether then you will enjoy this collection. It highlights some of the great Yankee moments from the past. The players...the coaches..the highlights and at times some lowlights but all in all a great addition to your Baseball DVD collection. It's a home run!!,1219449600,,303,4.96078431372549
2922287,5,B000UL61DY,If you are a Yankees fan then this DVD set is a must have!  The individual shows highlight a Yankee from the past or present.  They are well written and are over too quickly.  You will love each one!,1215388800,,199,4.051282051282051
2922288,5,B000UL61DY,As a Yankee fan and unable to get YES it's great to pickup this series on some of the Great players and managers who wore pinstripes over the years.  Hopefully they will come out with another edition soon.,1211587200,2,205,4.394736842105263
2922289,5,B000UL61DY,"I'm not even a Yankee fan, but I thoroughly enjoyed watching this series.  The people at the YES network have put together a collection that is nothing short of classic baseball history.  My favorites were the segments featuring the old-timers, particularly since they contain a lot of vintage footage that I'd never before seen. I hope someone at MLB is watching the success of this DVD and will create a similar collection featuring many more great players (and managers) from other teams.",1210982400,14,491,4.975609756097561
2922290,3,B000UL61DY,"First off, this is a very nicely produced and packaged set.  It's great to have most of the episodes (this is NOT the complete series) in one set.  Most of the bonus features from Hart Sharp Video's 4 sets is carried over, but as I went through the set, some segments are missing.  Also, the audio commentaries (on the Berra, Torre, Posada and Rivera eps) are not included.  Right now, the set is $40 as opposed to the retail price of $100.  For me, $40 for the ten previously unreleased episodes made this a worthwile purchase.",1208908800,20,528,4.458333333333333
2922291,5,B000UL61DY,"This is a wonderful series, and it's great to be able to find the whole thing in one place like this.  Our family are die-hard Yankee fans, and have enjoyed many of the sections of these DVDs over and over.",1206057600,13,206,4.15
2922292,5,B000UL61DY,"My teen son has this set and it comes with a lot of play time! Great set and tons of info! Perfect for any Yankees fan, or any baseball fan interested in baseball history!",1292716800,,171,4.0588235294117645
2922293,5,B000UL61DY,Item as described and shipped in a timely manner.  It was a gift and they loved it!,1282262400,,83,3.8823529411764706
2922294,5,B000UL61DY,"If you are a baseball fan and especially if you are a New York Yankees fan, this is an informative collection of biographies--and baseball history.  It starts with Ruth and Gehrig and comes up to the present.  Each program is about an hour long.

Most hard-core fans already know about the early greats, and those programs are fine, but it gets better with the pieces about Berra, Mantle, Ford, etc., because there are more clips of their great moments.  The bio of legendary Yogi alone is worth it all.  His son tells that Yogi once called a pizza parlor and asked for a medium pizza.  ""You want that cut in 8 slices or 4?"" Yogi was asked.  ""Better make it 4,"" was the reply.  ""I don't think I can eat 8.""

There are fine clips of Mantle launching spectacular home runs, Ford on the mound, Yogi hitting homers on pitches out of the strike zone.

This is well done and a treasure for the fan.",1274054400,3,892,4.351515151515152
2922295,5,B000UL61DY,"The product shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition.  My parents have been enjoying watching this together, and have said the production quality is outstanding.  Love it!",1271635200,,179,5.592592592592593
2922296,5,B000UL61DY,This is a wonderful gift for the die-hard Yankee fan! My Yankee fan LOVES it and watches it over and over again.  Even the non-Yankee fans in my house agree that this is a great collection of baseball history.,1263772800,,209,4.358974358974359
2922297,5,B000UL61DY,"Purchased as a gift for my father, a long time Yankee fan.  He has enjoyed the set immensely.",1261440000,,93,4.166666666666667
2922298,5,B000UL61DY,"I bought this for my dad, he's originally from New York, and since we live in California there isn't often an opportunity for him to purchase Yankee items.  I found that this was just a fantastic find and buy.  Though I haven't personally watched it, I know that my dad thought it was completely awesome.

I think that having it in such a nice sporty case sleeve was a really nice addition and shows off the Yankee pride well.",1250899200,2,426,4.367088607594937
2922299,5,B000UL61DY,"I purchased this for my husband as a Fathers Day gift.  He has the first two sets, but I was able to buy the Mega-Set.  The new DVD's have been updated so more players were added to each set. This was a great bargain.",1246752000,,217,3.909090909090909
2922300,5,B000UL61DY,"This is a must for any Yankee fan, especially if you don't get the YES network.  I do have it, so I've already seen most of these episodes, but I get impatient with all the commercials on the TV broadcasts.  It's a real pleasure to watch these videos without all the commercial interruptions. They are also a wonderful way to introduce my 11 year old grandson (a huge baseball fan) to the Yankee greats of the past.  There's no need to pay full price for this set though.  Bargain prices abound, so be sure to look around for the best deal.",1245196800,,540,4.316831683168317
2922301,4,B000UL61DY,"I have caught of the few episodes of Yankeeography of the YES network but wanted to see more.  It's better without the commercials of course.  The coverage is good, but perhaps updates at the end would have been a nice touch, like the passing of Bobby Murcer since the making of it. Overall I think it was well done in following the individual Yankee careers in less than an hour apiece.  I may have elongated some things, like Lou Gehrig's ENTIRE speech, etc., but for the most part is great for most fans, except maybe the diehards, who aleady know this stuff and are looking for more.",1241913600,,587,4.4672897196261685
8213685,5,B000UL61DY,It was a gift for a friend and it was great,1465344000,,43,3.0
8213686,5,B000UL61DY,Very good product!!!!,1441584000,,21,6.333333333333333
8213687,5,B000UL61DY,"Since I don't live anywhere near NY, it was hard for me to actually see these Yankeeography vignettes when they came out. Thankfully, this DVD set allowed me the opportunity to learn more about all of my Yankee favorites. If you like Jeter, O'Neill, Williams or any of the other great Yankees of the past 30+ years, Yankeeography is a way to learn their background stories. True blue Yankee fans will love this set!",1426032000,,415,4.621621621621622
8213688,5,B000UL61DY,Enough said - it is ALWAYS good if it involves the Yanks and this is no exception.  Go get it for yourself or a fellow Pinstriped fan,1388448000,,133,3.925925925925926
8213689,5,B000UL61DY,I love this DVD set. The only person that's not in this but really should be of course is George! Though I love this complete yankeeography!,1358294400,,140,4.423076923076923
8213690,5,B000UL61DY,"Yankeeography megaset, is an excellent product. Very informative and sometimes with a little of emotion, principally when the number of the uniform of some players is retired. I give to this product five stars.",1345680000,,210,5.205882352941177
8213691,5,B000UL61DY,Got this for my father in-law and he loved it. He let his father watch it and he loved it as well. Great dvd set!,1302739200,,113,3.56
8213692,5,B000UL61DY,"I bought this set about a week ago, and have only watched 8 (Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Rizzuto, Berra, O'Neill, Jeter, and Posada) of the 31 biography's so far, but I can already say this is outstanding! I'm a Tigers fan too, but appreciate the Yankees and what they mean to Baseball.

I found this for a good price, so picked it up, but wasn't expecting a whole lot. I'm a big Baseball fan, so I thought it was probably filled with a lot of info I already knew, clips I've already seen, and was wondering if it was going to be filled with Yankees ""Homer-isms"" since it was the YES Network. Was I wrong! There was things in the Ruth, Gehrig, and DiMaggio ones I didn't know, and clips I haven't seen!

However, I think what makes this set so great is what's on there about their secondary stars like Rizzuto, Berra, and Posada. The Rizzuto one is very funny and so is Berra's. Posada's is very heart warming with the section about his family and everything they went through with Jorge Jr.!

Very well done Yankees and YES network. I'm looking forward to watching more.",1299110400,7,1067,4.433673469387755
8213693,5,B000UL61DY,"Purchased the Yankeeography Mega-set 1-4 as a Christmas present to my daughter and son-in-law. What a great Christmas gift, they loved it! We saw a few of the episodes over the holidays and they were great, baseball history on videotape.
Highly recommend.",1295222400,,255,5.095238095238095
8213694,4,B000UL61DY,"I purchased this DVD set for my father-in-law, who is a huge Yankee fan, and I must state, he was addicted to it immediately & wanted to watch as much as he could in one sitting. Since he is ill, it was a pleasure to see the expression on his face - I think this is one of the best gifts I could have ever bought!!",1294704000,,314,3.772727272727273
