7885547,2,6305131368,"THUNDER MISSION (1992) is a lesser fighting-femme Hong Kong thriller which functions mainly as a showcase for Japanese stuntwoman (and bodybuilder) Michiko Nishiwaki who plays a Hong Kong businesswoman fighting with her Japanese half-sister and brother-in-law over the family inheritance after their father dies. The husband is in league with a Japanese syndicate trying to get hold of the late father's holdings. The family melodrama gets in the way of the kung fu, although there is a final scene at a massive abandoned coal mine where all the characters fight the syndicate thugs in an all-out kung fu battle. It's somewhat improbable that all of the principals would know kung fu, especially since so few of them are actually involved in crime or police work, but if they didn't, the film would've been a total loss. The sadly underused  Nishiwaki later relocated to Hollywood and, among other things, worked on CHARLIE'S ANGELS as a stunt double for Lucy Liu. Her female partner in THUNDER MISSION is played by Wong Hung and is a pretty good fighter also. The film's title has absolutely nothing to do with anything in the film.",990921600,,1133,4.963157894736842
