8593274,5,B00DHLLZB2,"I am an  avid X-Files fan. Will always be, so I was excited to watch this DVD. Great Series and I understand another one will be released next year. Gillian Anderson is awesome as usual. She has an English accent which is right up her alley since she spent some time in England when she was younger.",1378944000,,299,4.245614035087719
8593275,5,B00DHLLZB2,I haven't  watch the  dvd all the way  yet but it works  fine.  Have no complaints with this  company  and will do  bussiness with again.,1373587200,,137,4.2
8593276,1,B00DHLLZB2,"Gillian Anderson's obvious attempt to be the next Helen Mirren (Prime Suspect)  is quite sad and tragic.,  in actual fact she comes off looking, acting and sounding more like Madonna.  Series 2 has just been commissioned and OH JOY  Gillian has been made executive producer :(
I shall NOT be tuning in.

AND  there is a reason this was broadcast on BBC2 and not BBC1.,  IT'S NOT VERY GOOD !",1373328000,,390,4.485714285714286
8593277,1,B00DHLLZB2,"Oh my.
What a total turkey. And it is not even Thanksgiving Day.
Acting, story, direction, all are at the lowest possible strata in this BORING
and TIRESOME sort of a serial killer thingy. This is one of the worst films I have
seen in a very long time.
Admittedly I only watched the first disc's worth of this rubbish, but...
I am a nice guy not given towards self abuse in any form.
Ms. Anderson's plastic performance is reason enough to run from this
Buzzard.
The production was mildly OK. It did show some of the less depressing parts of Belfast
but lost the flavor of the situs.",1372896000,2,582,4.348623853211009
8593278,5,B00DHLLZB2,"This is the sort of story that I think ""can't quite tear your eyes away from"" qualifies as a descriptor.  I'd say it's one half ""Prime Suspect"" except with Gillian Anderson playing the role that Helen Mirren played in that series.  She's a posh British detective superintendent brought in to review several unsolved murders in Belfast.  Like Mirren's character in ""Prime Suspect"" Anderson's character is a driven, ambitious, and isolated woman.

The other part of series is we see the killer at work.  I don't know the actor who plays the role, but he does a great job depicting someone you'd never in your wildest dreams think to be capable of the horrors we see him commit.  On the surface, he's a happily married man with a wife and kids who adore him.  He's got an artistic streak...we see this in his casual and oh, so sinister doodlings.  And get this, he works as a grief counselor.

As I said, at the beginning of this, it's all extremely compelling but I would provide a warning that this is not for the faint of heart.  The crimes are depicted in graphic detail and just as disturbing, we get a front row seat to the bizarre ritualistic behavior of the killer (the souvenir taking, etc) as well as the stalking.  So don't say you weren't warned.

As for Gillian Anderson's performance, it's pretty good.  I didn't know that she had lived in the UK for a long time and could do a spot-on British accent.  And she demonstrates her chops as an actress by appearing radically different than she did in the X-Files.

I won't say the story is perfect...there are a couple of moments that characters do things that I find it hard to believe they would do (like Anderson's character inviting a hunky police officer she glimpsed from her car to come visit her in hotel room ""after hours"").  But for the most part, this is a great and haunting story.",1372636800,4,1850,4.54380664652568
8593279,4,B00DHLLZB2,"These five episodes leave the viewer wanting more, that's for sure.  I read somewhere that this is a current series, so hopefully there will be more.  I was surprised to see Gillian as a blonde.  I guess I do prefer her as an auburn-haired woman as she was for so long on the X-Files.  Speaking of that series, Ms. Anderson acts in ""The Fall"" with much like the persona of Agent Scully.  I wonder then, whether Agent Scully and Stella are Gillian Anderson?  I haven't seen a broad range of characters from her, but to be fair, I haven't seen other work she's done since the X-Files.",1371600000,,582,4.392523364485982
