7910998,5,B00000INZ5,"The hydrogen bomb is one of defining technologies of the 20th century, and without a doubt the most frightening. In the years immediately after World War 2, the American government and the Soviet government rushed to develop a fusion bomb much more powerful that the recently developed A-bombs which were dropped on Japan, ending the war.

Describing the frenzied scientific zeal with which the H-Bomb was pursued by the two governments in livid detail, the unstoppable technology of destruction seems to have a life of it's own. ""Race for the Superbomb"" achieves a philosophical grounding that's hard to dispute. It is probably the finest documentary that PBS ever aired, and the incredible interviews with Richard Rhodes, Laura McEneney, the mercurial and eccentric Edward Teller (recognized as the father of the American H-Bomb), and the more conciliatory Hans Bethe, are laced with priceless ex-classified government footage, as well as a detailed accounting of the Russian side of the story. David Ogden Stiers' superb narration and the unbelievably great score by Michael Whalen round out the remarkable sonic components that help make this film so disturbing and so essential.

Laced with terror, irony, humor, career perspectives, military secrets, political intrigue, and nuclear test footage, ""Superbomb"" provides the deepest and most elegant view of the dilemma at the center of the cold war, a circumstance with which we still live today.

Is it ""deterrence"" or is it ""terrorism""? It depends which side you're on. But in their capacity to create terror amongst the people of the world, these peace-loving scientists, statesmen, and military men make Osama Bin Laden look about as threatening as a germ on the kitchen counter.

Congratulations to Filmmaker Thomas Ott on a memorable piece whose influence and effect will probably last well into the future. If you've seen a lot of PBS docs, this is one of the big ones you missed, believe me.",1244937600,,1953,5.190476190476191
7910999,5,B00000INZ5,"""Race for the Superbomb"" chronicles both the U.S. and Soviet efforts to develop and then harness a successful hydrogen bomb in the early 1950s.  Terrified by Soviet discovery of the atomic bomb, the United States  was spurred into building something even more powerful.  After it  succeeded, it faced the equally daunting task of what to do with it.  The  Soviets faced the same challenges, as this two-hour documentary ably  demonstrates.
""Race for the Superbomb"" explores the political  climate of the post-war world and how the mounting tension between the  U.S.S.R. and the U.S. led to an ever-growing nuclear arsenal.  This film  benefits from current interviews from several key participants in the  development of the hydrogen bomb, especially its ""father,"" Edward  Teller.  The film also employs recently-declassified footage of bomb tests  and experimentation.
This is a thoughtful and thought-provoking probe  into the reasons behind the hydrogen bomb's inception.  In today's post  Cold War world, we accepted the existance of these nuclear arsenals without  question.  This film tells us how it all happened in a well-balanced manner  and from the perspective of those who were there.",958867200,7,1196,5.391304347826087
