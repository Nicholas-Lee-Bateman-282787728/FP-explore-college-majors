7070886,5,B00USBLYCO,"What a value!!!  Two great movies at $13.39 at the time of my purchase.

The original movie (1984) comes with great special features -
  * Red Dawn Rising
  * Training for WWIII
  * Building the Red Menace
  * WWIII Comes to Town
  * Original Theatrical Trailer (k... I admit it, I didn't watch this feature.)

The remake (2012) does not have any special features (which made me sad...) but I can't complain.

As for the movies -
I loved the original movie.  I wasn't aware of all the controversy at the time of my first viewing which was couple of years after it was released - too young.  I just loved the idea of teenagers who fight for their hometown, for their families and for their country.  The featurettes / documentaries were great.  Informative and entertaining.  It's also nice to see the actors so young - features interviews at the time of the re-release.  I can't remember who much time has passed as I am now old and memory wasn't as good as they used to be.  But it features Patrick Swayze.

I like the remake very much.  I thought the cast was good.  Chris Hemsworth and Josh Peck did a great job.  I give both movies 4.5 stars.

The rating I give is for the Bluray Set - for the value.  I highly recommend it.",1468800000,2,1228,4.31858407079646

8708064,5,B00USBLYCO,"The old Red Dawn is one of my favorite movies of all time. I like the newer Red Dawn as well, but not as well as the old one. The 80's version does a good job of conveying the hardships the high school age kids had to endure; the 2012 version goes a little over the top on some of the action scenes, but still a good movie.",1491868800,,323,3.764705882352941

8708068,4,B00USBLYCO,"This is a great movie. Maybe it is all of the nostalgia from the original movie, but I personally enjoyed this movie! Hemsworth gives and amazing performance in this movie. I am taking a star away because the movie was not perfect to me. But for those who have not seen the original, this would be great to watch.",1473811200,,313,4.322033898305085
