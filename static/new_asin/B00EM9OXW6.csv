It is not.
Exotic violence sells very well, especially if it happens in the mysterious part of mysterious Russiamysterious, that is, for a lazy westerner. Does it have anything to do with reality?
It does not.
Work is work and money don't smell, but Mr. Malkovich-Malkovich must be ashamed of himself. At least he should have known better that participate in this BS.",1417996800,,466,4.695121951219512
8606795,4,B00EM9OXW6,"This is a film based on the memoir of Nicolai Lilin - and it is about being a member of the Urka community growing up in Soviet Russia in the back end of nowhere in a province/republic called Transnistria. He comes from a long line of `honest criminals' who look after their clan closely against all outsiders but most of all against officialdom and the corrupt and hated police.

We have the story of Kolyma and his three friends. They live in harsh times, robbing to exist and accepting life's more brutal side. Kolyma's grandfather is Kuzya played by John Malkovich. Who as ever has enigmatic screen presence, and this is despite putting on a Russian accent that makes him and everyone else sound like adverts for cheaper car insurance. Kolyma also has a friend - Gagarin who is slightly wilder than most and gets into trouble a tad too easily.

We have the story of their youth told in the stories of their manhood and how the changing times, both politically and socially, cause sides to change, allegiances to falter and ideals to fall. Throughout the whole thing is the home-spun wisdom from Grandfather Kuzya who acts like a kind of moral compass for ne'er do wells. There is a fair bit of violence too and some of it can be brutal but it is all in context.

This is an Italian production with a mixed bag of actors, mostly not very well known and of varying abilities in the acting department. What holds it together is the strength of the story and the unwinding narrative that builds to an inexorable conclusion. It is not great cinema but is a million miles away from being bad and at a run time of 110 minutes it just about manages to not out-stay its welcome. Just a note for Malkovich fans, he is as always really very good, but this is not a performance he was preparing an award speech for. Still it kept me entertained and so I think there is a lot here to garner praise.",1390608000,,1889,4.438040345821325
8606796,3,B00EM9OXW6,"I was somewhat disappointed with this film. The only thing positive about it was that I learned about the ""education"", ""religion"" and ""ways"" of Siberian clans exiled to Moldova. This was interesting to learn about, although I can only say that the film is just OK. Why? Well:

First of all, I have never understood why movies that are set in a country where English isn't spoken are filmed in English. Everybody spoke with such a strong, Russian accent that was very distracting. Wouldn't it have made more sense to film it in Russian? At times, I even thought this bordered between exagerated and silly. Perhaps, Salvatores was looking to appeal to American audiences, but, to me, this didn't make any sense. The same happened with the Hungarian film ""The Door"", where characters spoke with a British accent even though they pretended to be raised and born Hungarians.

Next was the acting. This also seemed forced and amateur, which, along with the thick, Russian accent I mentioned above, was also very distracting. I understand that Salvatores used first time actors, but, seriously? There wasn't anybody better? Xenya, played by a professional, British actrees, was the worst of all of them, to the point of becoming the most obnoxious character in the film.

Finally, I thought it lacked emotion and passion. There was never a moment where I thought something was unexpected. I am not saying the film was predictable, but it was made in a way that even the main, unexpected twist didn't cause any kind of impact. Even the soundtrack was boring. The piano pieces aiming to enhance the mood every time there was a moving moment were rather corny for a movie about Siberian clans.

I have been a fan Gabriele Salvatores not only because of his Oscar winning film ""Mediterraneo"" but also because of his excellent film ""Amnesia"", where he demonstrated what he is capable of doing as a director. ""As God Commands"" was also very good.

I have not read the book, but, after having watched this film, I am not in the least interested in reading it, since I already know the ""unexpected"" main twist and even though there are supposed to be differences between both.",1384560000,,2161,4.814016172506738
