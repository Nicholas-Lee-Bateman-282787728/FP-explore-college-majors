7812296,5,6301520203,I've been interested in the JFK assassination since 1973. I recorded many of the documentaries on my VCR and now want to have them on DVD in my collection.,1483228800,,155,4.379310344827586
7812297,2,6301520203,"This 1988 production is getting pretty dated by now -- it was amateurishly produced in the early era of video and it doesn't hold up well today, despite the fact that most of the historical footage dates from 1963 or before and is ""evergreen"" (even a shot of Marilyn Monroe during the Korean War was somehow recycled into this production).  It's basically a ""talking head/public domain footage"" video that re-stitches existing motion picture clips (most of which you've already seen before) using the stentorian tones of James Earl Jones in an attempt to covey gravitas.  There are a few rarely-seen clips that prove interesting, but most of this archival material is readily available on Youtube these days.

A remarkable number of major names appeared in this video -- former President Gerald Ford, Coretta King, Tip O'Neill, Andrew Young, John Lewis, numerous others -- but their presence doesn't transform this video into any sort of polished, lasting, or definitive production.  The producers look like they caught James Earl Jones on an idle weekend at the beach (Topsiders and no socks and all!) and hastily got him to record his bridge narrations.

I think after nearly 30 years, a cheaply-produced 1988 video is a candidate for retirement.  There are many other productions since that time concerning the Kennedy assassination in 1963 that were more skillfully scripted and produced for anyone to invest in this dated effort, unless you are interested in the talking-head comments, opinions, and interpretations of three decades ago.",1465862400,,1542,5.172690763052209
7812298,5,6301520203,Should be read by anyone not around when the man was murdered.,1405123200,,62,4.25
7812299,5,6301520203,This is a gut wrenching re-opening of all the old horrors of this assassination. Like everybondy on earthm we all know where we were and what we were doing when we heard this dreadful news. I would recommend it to everyone - even as compulsory viewing.,1395532800,,252,4.5
7812300,5,6301520203,"This is an excellent one class period look at JFK and the assassination, perfect for showing to my 11th grade U. S. history students on the anniversary!",1388102400,,152,4.666666666666667
7812301,5,6301520203,"although this is an old documentary, it is very nicely done, & having it presented by James Earl Jones is a nice touch as he has the greates voice in the world. Highly recomend to any JFK fan.",1334016000,,192,4.078947368421052
7812302,4,6301520203,"this tape only briefly mentions on JFK's assassination. it mostly talks about his life and how he rose to power. James Earl Jones is the narrator and also talks very briefly about JFK's assassination.
still a good tape for those who liked Kennedy.",1026864000,,247,4.767441860465116
7812303,3,6301520203,"This is the first-ever DVD edition of this 1988 documentary on the assassination hosted by James Earl Jones, produced by WFAA, ABC's Dallas affiliate. During the 25th anniversary, this documentary aired on ABC, and it is unique because it mostly deals with everything America ""lost"" in 1963 as opposed to the minute-by-minute details of the assassination.  In fact, Kennedy's actual death is not mentioned till near the end of this 50 minute documentary.  The majority of the program deals with Kennedy's rise to the presidency and his time in office.  Other than some slanted references about ""a man with a rifle in a window,"" this documentary remains pleasantly unbiased.  It is the life and death of JFK from a historical perspective.  The only bonus feature is an edited newsreel of sorts that offers about ten additional minutes of (mostly poor quality) black and white footage of JFK (only 30 secs. about the assassination, though).  Overall, this DVD edition is worth it to have all the vintage news footage in a digital format.  If you are interested in the details of the actual assassination, buy ""The Men Who Killed Kennedy"" on DVD instead.",1006387200,11,1151,4.963541666666667
