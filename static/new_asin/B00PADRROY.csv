8687201,5,B00PADRROY,"There is something about the rhyming cadence of a Dr. Seuss story that gets my kiddos every time! We put this movie on at the end of a play date, and it actually kept both 4 year olds attention and had them asking questions! When does TV ever prompt that?  My daughter was so excited when she recognized a chickadee like at Grampys house. And the Fine Feather All-Weather Flying Machine at the end was super cool according to her too. This book is a great introduction to just what exactly a bird is, and all things fun about what birds are and what they do. With the animation and the fun of Doctor Seuss thrown in, its hard to go wrong. I think this is one that my little one will take little bits from every time we watch it!",1425254400,,728,4.163120567375887
8687202,5,B00PADRROY,"The Cat in the Hat Knows A Lot About That: Fun Feathered Friends is the newest DVD release in this fun and educational kids television series. My kids really enjoy getting wrapped up in the adventures of the silly Cat and his human friends, Nick and Sally. As you may have already guessed, this release is filled with episodes about birds! We meet all kinds of feathered creatures from the peacock to the peregrine (falcon)! There are 9 episodes on this disc for an approximate running time of 90 minutes. The episode titles include Fast, Fabulous Feathers, Biggest Bird, Bounce, Timmy Tippy Toe, Cotton Patch, Paper Chase, Little Lemmings and Polar Adventure. As always, I have to commend the Cat in the Hat series for drawing kids in with a fun storyline and then proceeding to sneak in a valuable learning experience. Keep up the good work!",1424649600,,843,4.741496598639456
