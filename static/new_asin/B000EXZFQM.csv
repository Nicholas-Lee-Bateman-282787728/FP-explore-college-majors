2546128,5,B000EXZFQM,A few basic rules reiterated in this series have drastically improved peace in our house.,1185148800,,89,5.0
2546129,5,B000EXZFQM,"This DVD is awesome to have because being a single mom (parent), it's hard to find a lot of free time to read up/catch up on the healthy, constructive ways of raising children.  I gave it a 5 because it has awesome tips and they work.  I would advise however, that many of the episodes are repetitive to some extent so don't expect to want to watch the whole series in one night.",1179100800,9,379,4.178082191780822
2546130,4,B000EXZFQM,"A good set of episodes, the Super Nanny's dry humor and glib handling of ill-behaved kids always makes us smile.  And to see her bring out the goodness in the kids (and the common sense in the parents!) is always a heartwarmer.",1176249600,10,227,4.404761904761905
2546131,5,B000EXZFQM,I find these videos very helpful for my parenting.  I think they are a great value for the entire season.  I hope they come out with the next season soon as Supernanny has tweaked her methods a little since this opening season and she's only gotten better at this job.,1173312000,5,268,4.34
2546132,5,B000EXZFQM,I bought this product for my mom for Christmas 2006.  She has raised 5 children and is now enjoying grandchildren.  She says that she enjoys watching Supernanny in her spare time and enjoys passing on the advice to all of us - her kiddos! :)  It was the perfect gift and Mom is getting many hours of enjoyment by watching it!,1168819200,3,325,4.295081967213115
2546133,5,B000EXZFQM,"I bought the DVD as a gift because a friend of mine was having a hard time with her kids, they were running the house and didn`t respect her at all, and i thought maybe this could help her. A few days later i bumped in to her and she was very grateful, she said all the tips the supernanny gave were right on the money, the kids respected her a bit more, they were more obedient, and she was very pleased with the results, i thought, well maybe she`s just saying it, but no i saw the kids and they really did change they're behavior.

I really really really recommend the Supernanny DVD, if you or some you know are new parents and seem to have a hard time educating the kids, this DVD is a must see.",1168300800,16,700,4.0359712230215825

2546135,5,B000EXZFQM,"I have a toddler who just hit ""terrible twos"".  I've heard a lot of good things about the ""Supernanny"" show but never watched it, so I decided to buy a DVD.  I'm glad I did!

The Supernanny provides very clear instructions on her parenting techniques.  First we see her doing the technique, then the parents.  Then it goes in detail in what the parents did wrong when implementing the technique, and shows again how to do it correctly.  This repetition really helps to finally ""get it"".

I read lots of parenting books, but watching this DVD beats mosts of these books hands down!  What you read in books can be interpreted in many different ways... most of which are wrong ways.  Watching the DVD allows you to SEE exactly what to do, and HOW to do it.",1159488000,27,753,4.437956204379562
2546136,4,B000EXZFQM,"Jo is excellent (except her speech - unasseptable, togever etc) and she has a great manner about her and skills enough to help these families out.  But I can't belive some of these parents.  Why don't they know that they are the parents and the kids are the kids and therefore the kids don't run the household.  Thank God for her - because without her, there would be more undisciplined kids than there already is.

Jo is fun and kind and I love her no-nonsense approach to her job.  Good on her.",1144972800,10,496,4.3478260869565215
2546137,5,B000EXZFQM,"FINALLY! Supernanny is on DVD THANK YOU JESUS! This show is great. Amazing to see how these children who act unruly to their parents and siblings change for the better. Jo Frost is the best nanny out there. A must have for parents. The DVD includes of course each family (10), bloopers, and discipline technique. I already have mine. Purchased it at target today for only $19.99.",1144972800,15,379,4.6716417910447765
2546138,5,B000EXZFQM,"Very good, realistic, usable advice. I really miss Supernanny. Her replacement is no comparison.",1414108800,2,96,5.928571428571429

2546141,5,B000EXZFQM,"After seeing these videos, I  wished I had seen them when my kids were children. It would have been so helpful to have had a workable, practical, systematic plan for disciplining and running the household. I think they would benefit all parents to see these videos as soon as their children are toddlers. Supernanny's methods work because they are consistent, fair, and loving. Some scenarios seem extreme. Perhaps parents who watch them early in parenthood can avoid many of the pitfalls that other parents have fallen experienced.",1411344000,2,532,5.114942528735632

2546143,5,B000EXZFQM,I love this ever since I was 20 years old. It has brought back a lot of memories. This is the best parenting show ever! I would recommend this to any parent that will teach their children good discipline! It's a must have!,1392681600,2,222,4.186046511627907
2546144,5,B000EXZFQM,"I love this DVD set.  I teach Parenting and Child Development.
I am using it in class to illustrate positive methods of discipline.
Excellent resource.",1382918400,,151,5.04
2546145,5,B000EXZFQM,"Good educational DVD. Timeout and other discipline rules are shown nciely. Sleeping time rules are also shown nicely. This is good as guidance, but it may not just work with all kids. Each kid is different.",1368316800,3,206,4.75
2546146,5,B000EXZFQM,I found these DVDs very encouraging even helping me with a 24 year old. Every one with kids should watch these no mater how old and with little one's for sure. very very good,1359849600,2,174,4.147058823529412
2546147,5,B000EXZFQM,"I had been searching for a Supernanny Dvd because I know that I needed it to help gain control of my 5 year old.

I love that I can pop this into the DVD player and get some more discipline tips.  Since getting the dvd it has greatly improved my tone, and trying to learn how to gain more control over a situation.

Just wish that it was cheaper, and that there were more episodes to watch.",1359072000,4,390,4.038961038961039
2546148,5,B000EXZFQM,"Supernanny was very difficult to find. I am very happy I found it here on Amazon. I always look here first.

I think Supernanny is wonderful! It helps to dare to discipline your child.  It is hard for some parents to do this, but if they do, they will see how worthwhile it is. Your child(ren)will love and respect you more!  I needed it for my grandchildren. They were walking all over me.  They didn't hug or kiss me. Now, I get all kinds of affection and respect. Children only respect you if you respect yourself!!!",1346198400,10,519,4.375
2546149,5,B000EXZFQM,"People in general tend to raise (their) children based on a mix of: a) ""how I remember that I was brought up"", but b) eliminating those elements that are too aggressive or old fashioned for today (spanks, yelling, emotional blackmail, ...).
Those that have more than one child, can apply what they learned with their firstborn to their 2nd, 3rd, ... children, but very few people have had the opportunity to try different techniques on hundreds / thousands of children to really find out those that work best.

Supernanny is one of those people. Jo Frost brings her experience of many years and many children to real parents who have (some serious) problems educating their sons and daughters (who are 1 to 6-7 years old on this first season as far as I remember).

For me, the most important contribution of this series is not the advise from somebody with a lot of successful experience on these matters (which is great), but to be able to watch her and hear her as she applies very finished techniques once and again on 10 different families with very different (some similar too) situations, parent needs, etc.

After watching the complete 1st season, it has become very clear to me that ""using the main idea of a technique"" is the very same as ""using no technique at all"". Each one of the described techniques involves several subtleties that make a huge difference not only on the technique's effectiveness but on the way the child perceives what he/she is being taught (hence the effectiveness I guess).

No magic solutions are suggested, but instead, a consistent way to approach things with children (on different matters like going to sleep, behaving well, eating dinner, sharing things with brothers / sisters / friends, etc.) each one with a particular technique that makes a huge difference for the whole family in very few days (according to what can be seen on the DVDs).

The best results of all is that the children of these families end up not only behaving very well, but being much happier after the changes introduced by the Supernanny than before she came in (needless to say, the parents end up extremely grateful).

I recommend this season to anybody looking for sound advise and practical techniques on raising children (of ages ~1-7) with modern and proven techniques as long as he/she is willing to:

a) Have a very consistent behavior towards his/her children's attitudes
b) Pay attention and apply the techniques to their last detail
c) Reach a good family balance, given that changes are introduced to the family schedule to help the children (and parents) have structure, as well as help the children have something to look up to.

Anybody that cannot / will not commit to those 3 things, I would not recommend buying the series, not because it would hurt, but because it wouldn't help either (other than its entertaining effect of course, but if entertaining is what you look for, there are better series out there).",1315785600,3,2948,4.812252964426878

I watched Jo Frost and her way of dealing with children and her methods are awesome, results without screaming and fighting.  I watched because Jo really caught my eye with her methods and wanted to learn from her.  I have wonderful young mothers I deal with weekly who have concerns because their 1 and 2,3,4,5 year olds are unruly.  I advise them to purchase this video, take note on how and what results are and apply to their situation.
