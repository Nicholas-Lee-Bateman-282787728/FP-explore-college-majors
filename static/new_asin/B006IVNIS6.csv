4991866,1,B006IVNIS6,"My mother took me to see the original stage play Mama I Want To Sing back in the 80's when I was about 9 or 10. She introduced me to the arts at a very early age.  So, I was thrilled to see that the play was being remade into movie form because it is such a special time from my childhood.  Well this remake sucks royally.  The director/producer deviated from the original script so much.  The only thing that is remotely close to the original stage play is the lead character played by Ciara wanted to sing secular music and her mother did not want her to.  This remake unlike Dreamgirl's which did a wonderful job of respecting the original script, is a tragedy. This film was way too modernized for my taste.  I do give the producer/director credit for having good actors however, there wasn't much they could do with such a crappy script.  I also give them credit for including Deleon Richards at the end, who played Doris Winters in the original play.  And if I'm not mistaken, I believe D'Atra Hicks, Deleon's understudy also had a cameo.  Overall, if you have ever seen the original don't waste your time.  If you have not seen the original and you think this movie will give you a good glimpse into what the play was like....Don't waste your time!!!",1329696000,7,1257,4.426086956521739
4991867,1,B006IVNIS6,This was one of those movies that never exactly held my attention. I figured out the plot way ahead of time because it reminds me of the movie Preacher's Kid but with less singing and not as much of a plot. Waste of time!,1329609600,2,221,4.045454545454546

4991987,3,B006IVNIS6,"I've seen the stage play and it was awesome. It also starred a woman that could sing and act.

Which leads me to this movie that I am so glad that I didn't waste MY money to see.

Why oh why would anyone give Ciara a starring role in movie about a girl who could sing? And secondly, why would they allow a person with absolutely no skill in acting a starring role?

I rated this move 3 stars on the sole point that I like the message and there are some good actors in the film. Everything about this movie was not horrendous, but Ciara's acting/singing caused me to cringe.",1389571200,,573,4.1441441441441444

4991993,5,B006IVNIS6,I saw the original Mama I Want To Sing play by Vy Higginson and have loved the story line ever since.  But this movie put a new spin on a great story and i fell in love with it all over again!  You won't be disappointed with this film!  Juanita Bynum is a natural!  I loved her performance!!,1379030400,2,291,3.9655172413793105

4991995,3,B006IVNIS6,"Having sen the stage version I foiund this version lacking in comparison.  The starring role performed by Ciara is shallow & weak while the role of the mother played by Lynn Whitfiekd is brillant, as expected.  Ms. Whitfield is a force to be reckoned with.  It would take a stronger presence to outshine Ms. Whitfield and unfortunately Ciara was not it.  The story is well prsented on a whole but without the strong vocal performance shown in the play my preference is on the stage version versus the movie .",1377043200,,508,4.611111111111111
4991996,5,B006IVNIS6,"I strictly got this movie for my cousin as a gag gift because each year a theatre production comes to town and in the commercial they just keep showing the actress belting out ""MAMA I WANT TO SING""  So it has become a running thing between us where we insert whatever word at the end and run with it.  So I can't comment on the movie itself and I don't even know if she has watched it yet or not that being said it has Lynn Whitfield & Patti LaBelle in it so I can't see it being that bad.",1376179200,,489,3.88
4992017,5,B006IVNIS6,Good storyline. The basis of this story is living your life and following your dream. Good material for a learning lesson.,1373932800,,122,4.857142857142857
4992018,5,B006IVNIS6,"I bought this for my mother and she is very, very with it. She has wanted it for a long time, so from now on I will be coming to you first when I am looking for something.",1370044800,,171,3.526315789473684
4992019,3,B006IVNIS6,"I have looked forward to watching this on film because i have heard so much about the play years ago. When it came to the screen though, I bought the dvd and just took the time to watch it tonight and my thing on the movie is this. When the father fell in the scene, you had no scene to support whether he lived or died. just that he wasn't in the picture. The brother who worked for both mother and daughter, but wanted to move on, it was like he was their puppet until he decided to move on. I had no love for Billy Zane's character, although most of the folks he portray are villians anyhow. the one part I could feel is when the lady who originally started this, Ms Vy Hygginsen came on and really talked to Lynn Whitfield's character and truly tried to level with her. She had a small part but was so significant in what she said. I feel the movie has a story that was to come out but somehow in the movie version, it didn't turn out that way.",1368921600,,948,4.047872340425532
4992020,4,B006IVNIS6,I have a collection of over a hundred and fifty musical so I wanted to add this. Will not be  one I watch often but it had a nice little story and the acting wasn't too bad.  Not great like the old classic musicals but  I enjoyed it,1367625600,,232,3.7916666666666665
4992021,3,B006IVNIS6,"This was a good watch, but it had a very stage-play feel.  I enjoyed it, but didn't feel like it achieved movie status.",1366761600,,119,4.173913043478261
4992022,1,B006IVNIS6,I adore Lynn Whitfield as an actress but no amount of actingtalent on her part could make up for a poorly written script and weak supporting cast.  Could have worked in theory but translation into film and the execution was amateur at best.  The title is pure irony as Ciara can't sing (let alone act),1364774400,,301,4.454545454545454
4992023,5,B006IVNIS6,"I LOVE IT...
It Expain how her father entrench her goal, as a singer snd to achieveE, with the acknwoledgementof success. Al-Though her father's death was sudden. The value with her mother role was most warming and important. She replaced the father.  The mother, being over-protected of her daughter singing, it always was disapproval and negative cristicim. The brother , is her super supporter.  But, he's caught between the drama of his mother and sister. Her brother sign himself into the militarty. The grandfather trying to achieve and  keep the family love by debugging the drama, The unfortunate sucess that mold the family togther, was a  UNIQUE PHOTOGRAPHER.  5+ STARS AND THUMBS UP",1364256000,,693,5.097345132743363

4992056,1,B006IVNIS6,"This movie was terrible! The acting sounded like a first rehearsal. When I heard a few years ago that the movie was in production, I was surprised that Ciara was chosen as lead. Her voice is not strong enough for the songs. But then I expected the movie was following the script of the stage play. Wrong! The only comparison of this movie  to the play was Desiree Coleman, the original Doris Troy, singing ""Not Created to Fall."" Ciara, though easy on the eyes, is no actress. Maybe she acted in plays in her hometown of Riverdale, Ga., but her performance would not cut it in any performing arts high school. Now I understand why this movie went straight to DVD. The storyline was weak. Even though Vy Higgenson, the writer of the stage play, was in the movie, I can't understand why she green lighted this project. Watch this movie on tv. Save your rental money!",1349568000,,863,4.496815286624204
4992067,1,B006IVNIS6,"I rented this movie from Redbox and the $1.20 I paid was too much. About 20 minutes in my boyfriend and I couldn't take it anymore. Ciara has clearly never acted before and the plot was terrible. Plus, how is the worst singer in the movie the lead--someone explain that one.

 If you proceed with purchasing this movie, the disappointment is your own fault. You've been warned!",1342396800,2,377,4.611940298507463
4992068,3,B006IVNIS6,"Although this presentation has some delightful merits on its own, it is NOT a faithful depiction of the original Musical as presented on the stage.  Some elements have been retained, such as a glimpse of an amazing gospel choir in rehearsal (but greatly abbreviated from the stage version).

The acting is decent, and some of the singing is quite rewarding.  The basic plot, that of a gospel singer who wants to become a pop superstar (against family objections), is retained.  The movie can be enjoyed on its own merits, but should not be considered as a legitimate representation of the Broadway production.",1342051200,,609,4.9411764705882355

I understand why it was not released in the theater, but it was a good DVD movie. I love Lynn Whitfield in this movie, but there is no part that she has played that I did not like. As for the rest of the cast, they weren't the worst. So, for review purpose I give it a 5 out of 10.",1335139200,,406,3.7325581395348837

I didn't know about the musical until I had seen previews of this. I would reccomend this to everyone. The cast is just amazing. All of the musical and the soundtrack is amazing as well. I wish the movie was longer and didn't just around that much other than that amazing family movie.,1332115200,,401,4.220779220779221
4992079,1,B006IVNIS6,There are great actors in this movie but this was not the film for them. This was a waste of my money and energy. A major disappointment I must say. I cant  believe how bad it was.....,1331942400,2,184,3.972972972972973
4992080,4,B006IVNIS6,"Big Up Ci Ci! great movie! this is one for the whole fam to enjoy! If you like singing & following your dreams, look no further!",1331856000,,128,3.9615384615384617
4992081,1,B006IVNIS6,"I was excited to watch this movie.. Since Ciara's record sales has been declining with each release... I thought maybe acting would do the trick... Ummm No!!

I won't be too hard on her because this is her first starring role in a straight to dvd movie..

The Script - WEAK!!
The Acting - WEAK!! (Exceptions: Patti LaBelle - Lynn Whitfield - Marvin Winans)

In my opinion I don't think this was a great role for Ciara. This role should have been played by someone with a soulful voice. Everytime Ciara opened her mouth to sing, it sounded like someone was scrapping their nails against a chalkboard. I'm a fan of Ciara's music, especially the songs she released off her first cd.. but this movie gets an one star movie.

My advice: Wait until this movie airs on BET... If this movie was called... Mama.. I want to DANCE!!! - Ciara would shine!!! but since it's not.. You know the rest...",1331856000,26,887,4.490683229813665
4992082,1,B006IVNIS6,"This has to be the worst movie I have seen in a very, very long time.  The movie wastes such great talent, especially Patti LaBelle and Paris Bennett.  It was amazing that seasoned actors such as Ben Vereen and Lynn Whitfield, both actors I respect, played cardboard characters that did not propel the movie or the plot.

Ciara was as interesting as a dial tone.  I take that back.  A dial tone would have been more rivetting.  Ciara has to be the most poorly cast member of this movie, and that is tragic considering that she is the lead.  Her acting (if you wish to call it that) might as well have been phoned in.  I tried to give this movie a chance, and I watched it from beginning to end.  And that was as poor a choice as putting this film on celluloid.",1331683200,5,760,4.222222222222222
4992083,3,B006IVNIS6,"I love all the characters of this film. I do love Ciara, but her voice just did not go for it in this movie. She's a great entertainer, but her singing too me was off. I know I cannot sing either, but a little more effort she could have been applied. I really like that fact that this movie was solely shot in ""NEW ORLEANS"" my home town. Great storyline it reminded you of the Preachers Kid a bit......try a lot!",1331596800,5,412,4.098765432098766
4992084,1,B006IVNIS6,"Please don't waste your time watching this movie. It was horrible. First thing first, Lyn Whitfield was amazing, even though she appeared to lip sync her sermons. Patti can sing her face off ...PERIOD!!. Ciara on the other hand. Ciara, Ciara Ciara, where do i even start. Lets start with the fact that she cant act at all. Couple that witht the fact that she spoke and sang like a 12 year old the entire movie, yes even after she ""made it"". They could have chosen any number of truly talented singers to play this roll. Paris Bennett, who sang one of the track ""I will"" for example.  The story line was all over the place, with no consistancy or follow through. The viewer is left to guess what happened to get them to where they were. Overall it had the potential, to be great and casting someone other than Ciara as the lead would have been a step in the right direction. Just my opinion",1330905600,25,889,4.355421686746988
4992085,4,B006IVNIS6,"I like the way the filmmaker did the opening; the sepia tone (warm brown tone) surely got my attention. It kind of had a feel of a classic movie - even though it wasn't in black and white - and I love to watch classic movies. I also enjoyed listening to Reverend Winter (Marvin Winans)singing right from the start.

Amara (Ciara): She's young Doris (Mariah Roberson) when the movie begins and she's using her beautiful singing voice for the Lord. Seven years later, she's singing in the club and then she gets a manager and rises to pop stardom. She remembered the words her father spoke to her when he was alive, but she took them out of context, the way some Christians misinterpret Scripture. But whatever choices she made when she stopped singing for Jesus, it was obvious she didn't stop caring about Him. Still, the question she asked her mother at the dining room table, she should have asked herself.

Doris' brother, Luke (Kevin Phillips): A gifted photographer and my favorite character. His dreams of becoming a photo journalist took him to a dangerous place.

Doris' mother, Lillian (Lynn Whitfield): Did she want to build a mega ministry for Jesus or gain recognition for herself? She was not happy with the woman her daughter had become, but she couldn't see the woman she had become.

Horace Payne (Ben Vereen): I liked his words of wisdom and he was witty.

Amara's Manager (Billy Zane): An irritating man.

Revelation Network: Were they looking to expand to reach the lost or for financial gain?

There was a scene with Lillian and Smokey Norful (as himself) that showed how `unreal' television ministry can be at times, but it did make me laugh. And the scene where Luke was talking to Horace was touching.

I watch a movie more for the storytelling, and I pay close attention to the words that are spoken. What grabbed me and made me nod in agreement and say, Amen:

1. The higher up the ladder you go, the more difficult the tests become.
2. This is not about business. This is about right and wrong.
3. Inside every person there is a gift, a calling. And that gift and calling is a direct link between you and God. God placed it there. But it is our responsibility, our duty, to discover, uncover and then recover that gift.""

I never saw the play, but there was much said in this movie to give the audience something to think about. I would have preferred a different ending, but I highly recommend this inspiring film.",1330387200,19,2441,4.590804597701149
4992086,5,B006IVNIS6,"I had waited a long time for this movie to come out on DVD, but after reading the other reviews I started not to watch it. However, I saw a better preview on another DVD so I decided to rent it on Amazon Instant Video.  I enjoyed it so much that I plan to purchase a copy for my collection. Lynn Whitfield's last sermon was very believable and touching.  Perhaps, if you've seen the actual play, you may not get what you expect, but if you watch it without the comparison, I think you may enjoy it.  All I can say is watch it and judge for yourself.",1330214400,,549,4.064814814814815
