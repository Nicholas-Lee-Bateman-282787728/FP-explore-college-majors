7358335,5,B012STKM6W,"First, two bits of clarification.  The editorial reviews say that there are six new episodes of Lewis.  Not so.  There are three new episodes of Lewis, divided into two 45-minute segments.  Second, this set of discs is in the UK, region 2 PAL format and will not play on U.S. players (unless you have an all-regions player).  See below for more information on those.

The three stories in what appears to be the final season of Lewis are all academic in their basic plot arcs.  One for Sorrow concerns taxidermy and performance art; Magnum Opus concerns alchemy; What Lies Tangled is about mathematics, knot theory and biochemistry.  Of course, they're also about lust, greed, envy and other seven deadlies.  The stories are all workmanlike and not as convoluted as some of the Morse/Lewis tales can be.  They have some strong guest actors/actresses, the nice scores that provide so much of the series texture and the usual views of Oxford, though we tend to return again and again to the Radcliffe Camera and the Sheldonian.  The extensive references to the Inklingsthe Lewis/Tolkien/Barfield/Williams circlein the second episode assumes an awareness of this important phenomenon in Oxfords history.

The most striking element in series 9 is personal.  Jamess fathers (Nicholas Jones) mind is failing and James is at his side, trying to evoke the warmth and love which he has failed to receive in the past.  He is also arguing with his sister over their fathers care.  Meanwhile, Robbie is feeling nervous.  A new supervisory officers appearance reminds him of the tenuousness of his appointment as a retired, consulting officer.  The new supervisor, played nicely by Steve Toussaint, is a micromanager who constantly protests that Hathaway and Lewis should remember that these are their cases and that he does not want to interfere.

The supervisor relates to Hathaway as the superior officer and Lewis is aware of tight budgets and the manner in which they can affect those on limited, short-term contracts.  In the end he must decide between his personal and professional lives and this creates drama, particularly in the third episode.  Viewers are lead to see that something is coming to a close here, but the focus (not just the narrative focus, but also the cameras focus) on Hathaway, particularly in the final scene of the third episode, gives the audience hope that there might be a Hathaway series some time in the future.  Certainly the current audience would like to see that; Laurence Fox is an exceptional actor and I for one would rather see him get his own British crime series than fritter away his talents in throwaway Hollywood movies.

Bottom line: a solid set of stories, but with a sense of aging and loss.  Kevin Whately is razor sharp but he looks tired, almost surely by design.  (He looks and feels more like 74 than 64.)  I won't spoil the ending, but its more sweet Robbie than operatic Morse, as it should be.

Now: all-regions players.  Amazon (in the U.S.) sells them.  I have purchased two made by Pioneer and have been pleased with them.  They are priced around $100.  They offer several advantages.  They play international discs (easily); you pop in the disc and the player reads the format and starts the show.  They enable you to get international series before they are released in the U.S.  Finally, the pricing varies, sometimes dramatically, between the U.K. and the U.S.  Having an all-regions player enables you to comparison-shop.  The result is that the player pays for itself very quickly.",1458259200,46,3537,4.927241962774958
7358336,5,B012STKM6W,"lewis is a favorite and if you are considering purchasing series 9 you are familiar with the show.  i hope this won't be the last in the series. it didn't disappoint and the ending may leave an opening for yet another series.  i agree it's confusing the way regions 1 & 2 differ in numbering, but it doesn't take much effort to check things out.  i see the price is higher than when i purchased, not sure i'd pay the current price as much as i love the show. a while back i was tired of waiting for british programs to be released for region 1 and purchased an inexpensive toshiba all region dvd player and it has been worth it..",1456790400,13,629,4.181818181818182
7358337,5,B012STKM6W,"Confusion - Season 9 (UK) is Season 8 in the US.
The final season of Inspector Lewis.

These DVDs are UK region 2 PAL and won't play on 99% of US DVD players.
Unless you have a region-free DVD player, my advice is to wait for the US release of Season 8 on August 23, 2016:

U.S. version:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inspector-Lewis-Season-8-Blu-ray/dp/B01DGNBHS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inspector Lewis: Season 8 [Blu-ray</a>]

Even more confusion
Avoid this version of Season 8:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lewis-Series-8-DVD-2014/dp/B00MFVHOVK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lewis - Series 8 [DVD] [2014</a>]
This is Season 8 in the UK, or Season 7 in the US.
Aargh.

The ""Inspector Lewis Complete Series"", 33 episodes on 18 DVDs has just been issued. A fabulous bargain.
WARNING:
Amazon has screwed up the listing of the Complete Series box, confusing it with the Season 1-4 box (which was a disaster - edited episodes, no subtitles)
The top posted reviews on Amazon are for the Season 1-4 box.
The reviewer complaints are no longer valid.
The first posted review of the ""Complete Series"" box was my review titled ""REVIEW OF COMPLETE SERIES IN 18 DVD BOX"" (dated October 15, 2016)
It is posted to the right of the top three reviews.

I hope it explains the mess Amazon has made of this.

7358339,2,B012STKM6W,I thought because it was series 9 and the last one shown here was series 5 it would be a show I had not seen.  It was actually the same shows in our series 5.  Also I did not catch that it was for UK machines only.  I had a satisfactory return of the item. I am still waiting for shipment of my series 5 dvd.,1476403200,,308,3.6363636363636362

7358346,5,B012STKM6W,"This is not really a review about this series, which I just received yesterday directly from Amazon UK. And yes, I do have a region free DVD player (actually several) and it is likely that you may be able to modify the player you already have rather than purchasing one with the region-free capability. Just go onto the internet, type the brand of your DVD player, the model number, and add the word ""hack"" afterward and see what Google turns up. Probably about 10 or more hits that provide a simple 30-second (or less) procedure for turning your US-constrained player into a worldwide player through a combination of button-presses on the remote and front panel. Amazing the number of geeks out there with an anti-region-1-only zeal! Be sure to check out all your options, and pick the one that appears the simplest and best received by those offering their thanks.  Be mindful that removing regional blu-ray constraints is a separate and generally more difficult process--perhaps mandating your purchase of an already altered unit. The advantages? The DVDs ordered from the UK site tend to be MUCH cheaper...often less than half. Given my fondness for this show, Morse, Endeavor, Dalziel and Pascoe, Cracker, and French, Danish, and Swedish stuff (and I thought WE lived in the most murderous country!) and my obsessive collecting, the UK-direct option has saved me hundreds over the years.",1462752000,12,1392,5.0
7358347,5,B012STKM6W,This series along with Inspector Morse and Endeavour are the best.  I went out and bought an all region DVD player just so I didn't have to waituntil they came on American TV.  I hope they will continue it in the future.,1461628800,4,220,4.214285714285714

8726543,5,B012STKM6W,"Detective Inspector Morse was such a figure in the annuals of Masterpiece Theatre, particularly the Mystery Division. Since his death, DS Lewis his partner, has gone through one crisis after another. His wife was killed, his partner died, but on the bright side he was promoted to DI. He is still with the Thames Valley Police Department, and their turf is still Oxford. His new partner is a junior partner, Detective Sgt. James Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox, who is the epitome of DI Morse! They have the same sort of class rivalry, but it is upended. DI Lewis finally married his Pathologist, and they are happy. He returned to work after retiring several series ago, but he is on the edge of leaving, again. Hathaway became DI, and is is brilliant.

In this series, they deal with murder and mayhem and crimes of retribution. The series is separated into 6 episodes, with 2 episodes related to the same storyline. Lewis is much darker and his life is more complicated than the more frivolous Lewis we knew of yore. The murders in this series are incredibly complex, the stories much more updated and modern. DI Hathaway is from public school and Cambridge, so he seems to fit right in with the characters in these episodes. He smokes, was an athlete and once studied for the priesthood. He is tightly controlled , and he does not reveal much if anything of his background.

Lewis and DI Hathaway are the epitome of opposites attract, and they make the best pair of detectives. Masterpiece is known as giving us the best in performances, and once again, they deliver! Will Lewis leave for good, stay tuned.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 03-18-17",1489795200,,1649,4.758741258741258
