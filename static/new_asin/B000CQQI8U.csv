Sure, the concept is neat and there's some good cinematography, but the direction, script, and music-video editing all suck it down until it becomes a total bore. The five bimbos are abysmal and won't sustain your interest - not even in their half-naked states. In short, Death Tunnel won't scare anyone over the age of twelve.",1140480000,2,447,4.818181818181818

2470141,5,B000CQQI8U,"This was a good movie, a perfect filck for halloween. Should become one to watch yearly for those who want a good thriller. There is a series of flashbacks at the start that could confuse some. Basically bouncing from a party to scenes of the girls already taken to Waverly.  When the movie got started good, it was the type that makes you not  want to get up and use the bathroom because you might miss a scene. I would highly recommend reading about some of the things that they say happened at Waverly Hills, such as the story of the nurse they say died there. This would give a better understanding about what the storyline is based on. It will make more sence and help one appreciate the creativity better. Who ever created the story did a good job.  The filming itself and special effects Were really good. A lot of work apparently went into the making of this film. It certainly keeps the viewer wondering right up to the end. Also ghost hunters out there would love this as its filmed on location at what is known as one of the most haunted places on earth.

2470149,1,B000CQQI8U,"Wavery Hills is my favorite ""haunted"" place. When any show goes there, I set my DVR. When I saw that this movie took place there, I was thrilled. Now, I am very disappointed. In a 5-Star system, I never read one or five-star reviews. Five-Stars means the writer is to jaded to say anything bad. One-Star means the writer won't dignify anything worthwhile. But, there really isn't anything here to praise. The acting is terrible, the story is confusing and stupid, and with such a great history at Waverly Hills there was so much to draw on, but I don't remember Waverly Hills ever even being mentioned. I like horror movies, but this almost doesn't even qualify. It goes for cheap scares and actually offers more boobs than frights. I mean this movie is almost more soft-core porn. It was just sad. The best part is the cover, which really doesn't even fit the movie. Then again, the story makes no sense. Every scene is illogical; nothing makes sense. Suspension of disbelief only goes so far. Please watch something else, no matter hoe cheap this gets. It isn't worth it, I promise.",1350086400,,1084,4.651041666666667

 a horrible movie. It maybe a ghost hunters dream but this movie portraits it self as a evil place when its not.

2470152,3,B000CQQI8U,"I found this movie while looking for items related to Waverly Hills Sanatorium. I have been on an 8-hour tour, 2 years ago and am making another trip in June 2012. I recognize every shot in the movie. I give high regards to the filmmakers who were allowed to film on site. The Mattinglys are the current owners of Waverly Hills and the place was quite creepy and abnormal during an 8 hour almost pitch-black tour. If you've been you can tell what was added for the movie and what is real.
Using scantly clad women to attract viewers is a common ploy in filmmakers to draw audiences. The acting wasn't terrible, but the girls need acting lessons. It was worth watching, maybe even owning a copy but for me.....strictly for the Waverly Hills footage. WH has it's own website and anyone interested in haunted places should check it out.
While I have not found much on WH, it has been featured on many tv shows, specials, and is listed as one of the scariest places on the planet.",1331164800,,976,4.4581005586592175
2470153,5,B000CQQI8U,"Philip Adrian Booth's 2005 film ""Death Tunnel"" is a well-made horror flick about five college gals (in lingerie) locked in a huge abandoned sanatorium in Kentucky where 63,000 people died of the ""white plague"" in the early 20th century. It's supposed to be a college initiation, but things go sour when the ghosts of the plague victims show up!

I was surprised to discover that the acting was quite good by all the principles, at least for a Grade B horror flick. I say ""surprised"" because a few armchair critics diss the film for the supposed bad acting. Yes, there may be some side characters whose acting is questionable, but that's about it. A possible exception would be the girl who plays Ashley (Kristin Novak) and her over-the-top performance during the shower sequence, but this can be defended on the grounds that the script required a low camp approach to pull it off. How else could she deliver such dialog and be effective? She did it the way it had to be done.

""Death Tunnel"" is amazing because of its entertaining style. As far as filmmaking technique goes, this is top-of-the-line all the way. One reviewer properly described it as ""extremely impressive visual style combined with top notch kinetic editing work."" It's impossible to watch this movie and not be wowed by the filmmaking technique, even if you don't like the story or the way it's told (more on this below). It boggles the mind to think of the time & effort put into creating this film. Such attention to detail and professionalism is rare, particularly in low-budget independent fare.

In addition to the filmmaking technique, the locations, cast and score/soundtrack are superb. The film was largely shot at Waverly Hills Sanatorium near Louisville, KY, which is a perfect location for a horror flick. The film also features numerous ultra-gorgeous women, including the ones trying in vain to get out of the sanatorium (e.g. Novak as Ashley, Melanie Lewis as Devon and Yolanda Pecoraro as Elizabeth), a couple of the ghosts and even more. It's Grade A on this front. There's also a genuine aura of creepiness and a few good scares. Plus the modern metal song ""Disconnected"" by 9 Volt Revolt is excellent (featured in both the story and the end credits) counterbalanced by the haunting score by Christopher Saint Booth.

All this gels together for a massively amusing work of celluloid.

There's only one problem and that's the way the story is told, which explains my mediocre rating the first time I viewed ""Death Tunnel,"" not to mention the general negative reviews. The simple plot is presented in a very convoluted manner, mostly in the first act. There are so many flashbacks, flashforwards and flashbetweens it gets confusing and tempts the viewer to tune out during the first half hour. Moreover, there's almost zero build-up of suspense due to the flashforwarding and the fact that the girls are shown whining in terror from their outset in the sanatorium. Thankfully, the story settles down in the second and third acts where it focuses on the five girls trying to get out of the sanatorium.

I suspect the Booth brothers took this non-linear approach in the first act to disorient the viewer right out of the gate. If so, it works. But this is oft-putting to most people on their initial viewing because the movie requires you to concentrate in order for it to pull you in. I suggest re-watching the film, kick back, and just let it give you a good time. I did and it did. The story comes together as you are captivated by the movie magic.

A more linear approach to the storytelling would probably have made ""Death Tunnel"" more compelling, but after re-watching the film it dawned on me that Booth was shooting for art and originality above horror conventions, which should be respected. Besides, I was able to enter into the world of the movie and was mesmerized. What more could you ask for in an independent horror flick? The fact that ""Death Tunnel"" is an artistic horror film rather than a conventional slasher flick explains the mass of negative reviews, but anyone who appreciates cinematic art will value this film. You just have to be in the right mode.

Like many others, I didn't like the film the first time I watched it, although I was entertained by the spectacular visuals, which includes the stunning women, as well as the score/soundtrack. I decided to give it another chance with an open mind and found myself fabulously entertained; same thing with my third and fourth viewing. By the mid-point I found myself almost spellbound by the movie magic, which held me to the climax. You just have to accept that this isn't a dialogue-driven, plot-driven movie that focuses on slowly building suspense. Instead it's 90 minutes of horror and the entertaining elements thereof FROM THE GET-GO, which some people understandably can't appreciate.

If you didn't like the movie on your first viewing I encourage you to give it a re-watch sometime with these things in mind. You might like it.

FINAL WORD: ""Death Tunnel"" successfully combines grisly locations & F/X with stunningly beautiful women and a kinetic style for an amazingly entertaining film. What's more, the ending is actually moving -- there is a light at the end of the death tunnel.

""Death Tunnel"" has slowly become one of my favorite horror films. It runs 97 minutes.

2470154,1,B000CQQI8U,"This is the basis of the movie: there is an abandoned hospital, five young people wind up there under absurd circumstances and suddenly fast cuts ensue for the next hour and a half. I'll spare you from watching this horrible film: there is a girl looking scared, then a quick cut to a ""scary"" hallway, then a cut to a picture of an ""old timey"" photo. This repeats for an entire 90 minutes.",1307232000,,389,4.342465753424658
2470155,1,B000CQQI8U,"Atmosphere means a lot in a film, and abandoned hospitals are perfect settings for horror movies. Session 9 turned the Danvers State Mental Hospital into a terrifying character unto itself; Autopsy took every fear of hospitals and crammed them into a Grand Guignol. Death Tunnel uses the Waverly Hills Sanatorium as its main set, trusting that the decaying shell of the hospital will carry the story.  And for five minutes, Waverly Hills is a pretty disturbing place.

But then five bimbos show up dressed in lingerie. As part of a hazing ritual, they must survive five hours in Waverly Hills. The girls don't like each other, of course.  It's never actually demonstrated why this is the case; because there isn't enough dialogue to generate any character development; we have to simply accept that the characters don't like each other, presumably due to some rivalry over the hunky male lead who helps coordinate the contest.

It's amazing just how shallow Death Tunnel is. It uses every trick in the horror book: a Psycho-like shower scene, a creepy Saw-like voice, and a sepia-colored lens that has been in every horror movie ever. It throws in stuttering images, blurry ghosts, and plenty of shrieking sound effects.  Horror movies are often derided for the cheap scares generated by random squeals to jolt the audience - Death Tunnel has to be the first movie made up EXCLUSIVELY of this trick.

The acting is bad. The plot is derivative.  The editing is terrible.  The audio is irritating.  It's not even campy. Death Tunnel is like someone played a Halloween special effects CD on random and then turned on Chat Roulette.  Actually, if you did that you'd get a better movie than this tripe.",1292284800,3,1697,4.881533101045296
2470156,3,B000CQQI8U,"This movie is difficult to understand if one does not know the history behind the Waverly Hills sanatorium, and the happenings which continue to occur at this facility. The director took reported occurrences and tried to build a film script around them which I can appreciate. Having visited Waverly Hills on a couple of occasions, the building's creepiness is well captured. This place is plain scary at night and you are only allowed to carry a portable flashlight. I can personally attest to it's haunted reputation based upon my own experiences which were unexplainable. I was touched on the shoulder and had my hair pulled when no one was standing near me. This place continues to fascinate me. I will go back to take the 8hr overnight stay if I can build up the courage. I think for those whom are interested in visiting Waverly Hills or have already visited, this film is more enjoyable. Try visiting first and then rent this movie.",1292284800,,939,4.766871165644171

2470159,1,B000CQQI8U,"So much for my movie selections as far as Friday the 13th is concerned. This was the only thing I had at the time. I guess having Halloween just two weeks ago makes a November Friday the 13th irrelevant.

Death Tunnel absolutely stinks. There is NOTHING good about this movie. *Nothing* at all. Let's see what went horribly wrong (besides everything)-

In the beginning you see young women partying and having fun. Honestly, we've seen the same thing a thousand times. You KNOW what's going to eventually happen- it's only a matter of time before the young ladies fall victim to some graphic violence, blood and guts, and of course, death.

But Death Tunnel wants to go a step BEYOND that.

Oh no- a predictable storyline isn't enough for this movie. Death Tunnel wants to go one step beyond predictable and make the lead up to the suspense *entirely* pointless with regard to atmosphere and storyline, and try to make an introduction happen with some of the most generic writing imaginable.

A made-for-TV movie this one most definitely is. I feel sorry for television sets around the world that had to spend two hours being turned on for this junk.

Let's see...

We've seen it all before, done better in other movies like the Grudge. What am I referring to? The scenes where ghosts suddenly appear out of nowhere while loud static sounds indicate the sudden appearance of an ghostly entity. Yup, this movie features those.

Movie writers don't understand that the most effective way for ghosts to be scary is to make them appear *completely silently*. I don't want to hear ANYTHING while a ghost is forming. Then the ghosts will be scary. Seems pretty simple and yet, movie writers time and time again make this tragic mistake.

Here's some of the things in the movie that will make you sick (no, not sick with fear and violence- sick with pure hatred).

A woman is trapped in a room and an axe suddenly smacks against the door. The woman hears this, panics, and it's laughable that the thing we see during this moment is a freakin' axe banging against the door all by itself. I guess the writers didn't want to give away what the bad guy looks like, but just the way the axe bangs against the door made me laugh VERY hard.  It indicates the poor quality of the film.

Another example is a scene when one of the women walks up the stairs, and a body awkwardly drops down from the balcony, sending the woman screaming with fear down the stairs. The timing of the body falling was laughable.

How about the scene with a woman standing in a room and screaming when she sees a ghostly figure of a girl quickly dart to her side and head through a door? There's NO atmosphere here so it comes across as terrible rubbish and nothing more.

I hated this movie with a passion. PLEASE avoid. It doesn't even work on some campy level. It's just BAD.",1258070400,,2841,4.555992141453831
2470160,1,B000CQQI8U,"Picture Kate Beckinsale, Jessica Biel, Scarlett Johannsen, Jessica Alba, and Eva Mendes dressed in negligee, scared witless in a haunted sanatorium, and being controlled by a madman who likes scaring people.  Sounds good and scary, right?  Well, that's what it could have been.  Instead, just take away the big names, the acting ability, the intelligence, the palpable emotion, and picture the madman as the most generic Saw rip-off imaginable.  That's the premise for this abomination.

After being invited to a ""Truth or Scare"" party - which advises potential guests ""provocative bedtime attire a must"" - five girls, a grab-bag of beautiful, brainless, and/or busty, get dropped off on five different floors and are given five hours to wander aimlessly (like the movie itself), hyperventilate needlessly, look cute in their lingerie, and bulge out their eyes during scary scenes like Arnold did when his helmet busted open on Mars (picture Soundgarden's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Hole-Sun/dp/B000SMOLUK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Hole Sun</a>&nbsp;video).

The production value is decent, and the special effects are actually quite good, but the direction is atrocious.  This garbage jumped around so much I developed a mild case of vertigo.  For the most part this is just an excuse to introduce the young new actresses before their careers devolve towards the adult film industry.  Even the female ghosts (dressed tastefully in a low-cut nurse outfit) are busty for no other reason than the gratuitous.  Amid hallucinations, scene jumps, a character that looks like one of the Sand People from Star Wars, discontinuity that caused me physical pain, egregiously pointless flashbacks, and atrociously predictable outcomes, it's clear that this is just a really bad House on Haunted Hill remake.

On the bright side, the ""bad movie requires full frontal nudity""-rule was followed.  In a completely run-down, decrepit sanatorium that inexplicably has functional electricity and clean, running water, there's a delightfully improbably scene in which the busty blonde with no acting talent whatsoever decides to take an impromptu shower before one of the worst endings in cinema history.

2470165,2,B000CQQI8U,"What the Heck did I just watch here? Appearently, Death Tunnel is based on the true life hauntings of a Kentucky Sanatorium (actually used in the film) where thousands were sent and died of various dieases like Tuberculosis. The ""Death Tunnel"" as the title implies, was a shaft that the dead were taken through and carted away....

...but all that doesn't matter because that's not what this movie's about. Simply put, five empty-headed girls are brought to the sanatorium for some initiation to survive for five hours. But unknown to them, they all have some sort of family tie to it's previous generation's victims, and the ghosts are anything but pleased they're there.

Ah, blah blah blah, it doesn't make any difference because this movie stinks. Playing out like some decent looking rip-off between House On Haunted Hill '99 and Thir13en Ghosts '01, it's really hard to follow. It jumps all over the place from present, past, and not ever happening in an instant. And even if there was a little more nudity in this film it still wouldn't make me care any more about them. The acting's weak...so weak that if I wanted to see five over-hysterical women act this badly, I'd go tell my wife's family the turkey's dry at Thanksgiving. The only real reason this flix is gettin a 5 from me is the included documentary on the actual Waverly Hills Sanatorium which is more entertaining than the movie it's based on.

2470169,1,B000CQQI8U,"Five girls.  Five floors.  Five hours.  And believe you me, it will feel like every second of five hours before you finally reach the light at the end of the tunnel that is The End.  Now I knew going in that most people hated this movie, but I still wanted to see it, dadgummit.  After all, five sexy coeds in a haunted sanitorium can't be all that bad, can it?  The answer is a resounding Yes - it can and is that bad.  This isn't the kind of bad movie that totally amateur filmmakers might go out and shoot over the course of a weekend, either.  It takes a lot of hard work and effort to make a horror movie this wretchedly awful.  Apparently, it helps when the producer and director dress like Axl Rose.  The direction is terrible, jumping back and forth between the actual initiation and the leadup to it for at least the first half of the film and leaving a number of logistical questions completely unanswered.  Still, the brunt of the blame must fall upon the writers of this incoherent mess, for they truly deserve to be run out of town by a mob of pitchfork-wielding villagers.

Kentucky's Waverly Hills Sanatorium serves as an ideal setting for the horrors that were supposed to be unleashed here (in fact, the most interesting thing on the whole DVD is the descriptions by cast and crew of some of the spooky things they really experienced there), but Death Tunnel does no favors to the very real history of this medical institution.  The filmmakers reportedly used some actual EVP recordings in the movie, but, unfortunately, there is no explanation as to how these were obtained.

At least the five girls aren't bad looking at all, especially lead actress Steffany Huckaby.  Don't look for too much in the way of nudity, however, as the filmmaking Booth Brothers obviously don't subscribe to the old ""the worse the movie is, the more nudity you show"" tradition (if they did, they would have had no need for a costumer at all).  Not a single character is given an ounce of substance, so you could care less if and how any of them might die.  What you have here are just five college girls chosen for a special initiation at a Truth or Scare party.  One girl is deposited on each of the five floors (except they put two of them together for no apparent reason), and they have five hours to get out of the place by way of the infamous Death Tunnel.  They know all this, and there are pictures and newspaper clippings everywhere identifying the place as an old sanitorium, yet it takes Heather, supposedly the smart one, almost seventy-five minutes to figure it out (which takes something away from what is supposed to be a climactic scene).  And the ending?  Don't even get me started on the ending.

A lot of work went into the special effects, but it's just a list of all your usual suspects - blurred images, shaking cameras, and computer-generated ghosts up the wazoo.  In other words, it's nothing we haven't seen before, especially in the past few years.  Personally, I found Death Tunnel about as scary as cutting my toenails.  I could be nice and say the filmmakers probably just tried too hard to make this movie scary, but there's no getting beyond the fact that this is one rotten egg stinker of a horror movie.",1178323200,11,3232,4.531034482758621
2470170,1,B000CQQI8U,"How is it possible to set a movie in what's become known as ""the scariest place on earth"" and have it turn out so badly?

Beats me. But these people managed it.

The premise was passable, albeit B-movie all the way: ""Five sexy coeds who've been dared to spend the night"" in a creepy old building. (Note to future filmmakers: Any movie that starts with ""five sexy coeds"" is going to bomb.)

The location (Waverly Hills Sanatorium in Louisville, KY) amply provided the creepy old building. Images of Waverly Hills, alone, are enough to give someone the willies. Despite that, the scariest thing about Death Tunnel is that it got made in the first place.

The fault for this train wreck lies squarely with the script and the direction (both of which came from Philip Adrian Booth). I can't blame the actors. They probably thought it would turn out differently. At the very least, they knew they'd get a paycheck for their work. But the dialog and direction are horrendous. The director supposed mechanically-altered voices (low-pitched, of course, to sound evil), rapid jump-cuts, and grainy, often out-of-focus shots and nerve-jangling noises interspersed with whatever vapid acting was happening on screen equal suspense. He supposed wrong. They equal headache.

Hopefully, Mr. Booth hasn't yet quit his day job.

Watch this film only to see the setting, Waverly Hills Sanatorium. But be prepared to be thoroughly disappointed and frustrated by a movie that could have been outstanding with a better script -- and a director more interested in letting the story unfold than in taking the kitchen-sink approach by adding every horror-movie cliche ever seen.",1177459200,3,1655,5.043956043956044

2470174,1,B000CQQI8U,"They built the Waverly Hills Sanatorium back in 1910 to house tuberculosis patients. Makes sense seeing as how TB back in the day killed untold numbers of people. At first they only housed thirty to forty patients, but the surrounding area of Louisville, Kentucky was a rather swampy clime conducive to the TB bug, which meant a lot of people got the illness. In 1924 they expanded the hospital, turning the rather small building into a looming fortress of a compound that could hold upwards of 400 sick people. Fortunately, by 1943 the introduction of streptomycin radically reduced the numbers of people ill with tuberculosis. This meant that Waverly Hills Sanatorium's primary function no longer existed. After a twenty year stint as a geriatric hospital that ended in the 1980s, Waverly Hills Sanatorium closed down. How many people died in Waverly Hills from tuberculosis? Some reports say upwards of 60,000 in about four years. It's unlikely that that many patients died, but a lot of people think enough perished to fill the place to the rafters with ghosts. In fact, several television shows dealing with the paranormal have featured Waverly Hills Sanatorium in their programs. Some say it's the scariest place in the world.

You just knew someone would shoot a movie in a place as offbeat as Waverly Hills, and here it is. It's called ""Death Tunnel,"" named for the long tunnel underneath the hospital supposedly used to transport the departed out of the facility, and it's made by a couple of low rent Bret Michaels lookalikes called the Booth Brothers. The film throws five attractive yet catty girls--Heather (Steffany Huckaby), Devon (Melanie Lewis), Elizabeth (Yolanda Pecoraro), Ashley (Kristin Novak), and Tori (Annie Burgstede)--into some brain dead college initiation game run by Ashley's lunkheaded jerk boyfriend Richie (Jason Lasater) that finds them locked up in Waverly Hills for five hours. I don't know what they're supposed to do in this freaky place, other than pick up a key and unlock the bags around their heads. At least that's what the voice on the loudspeaker tells them to do. The owner of this voice is, of course, one of Richie's muscle bound friends. Richie soon shows up to watch the proceedings himself, but I'm getting ahead of the script here. In the meantime, the girls wander around wearing little nighties with the first letters of their names painted on them. Conveniently, these letters spell the word ""death"".

Through a series of confusing flashbacks, we come to see how these girls wound up in the Waverly Sanatorium. They're med school students (Gawd help us!) who went to Richie's party so they could all become part of the ""in"" crowd. Why there's an ""in"" crowd in medical school, or why med students dress like street tarts at beer and barf parties, is beyond me. Anyway, there was some lottery at the party, they incapacitated the girls, and the honeys wake up in Waverly Hills in the aforementioned nighties. The rest of the film sees these gals wandering around the gloomy surroundings running into the institution's ghosts. We've got a ghost with no eyes, one that plays with a ball, and some dude wearing a gas mask while pushing around a squeaking gurney. It's not very scary and, once the girls start dying in the exact same ways the ghosts died (Imagine that!), it's not very gory either. We do get to see Ashley's rack in a totally gratuitous shower scene (!!), but even that's not exciting enough to lift this movie out of the doldrums. By the time ""Death Tunnel"" screeches and judders to its mouth droppingly stupid conclusion, I just realized I witnessed one of the dumbest horror films to hit the scene since ""Feardotcom"".

It's difficult to say where ""Death Tunnel"" went off the tracks. What am I saying? It's not difficult! Let's start with the acting, or should I say the lack of acting? Within ten minutes I knew this movie was gonna stink big time mainly because the acting reeked. I've seen department store mannequins deliver better performances than the ladies in this cast. Heck, I've seen folks on life support deliver better performances than this cast. Tie these lousy performances to a toilet paper script, scotch tape editing, and plot holes the size of tuberculosis scars and you've got the nightmare that is ""Death Tunnel."" The movie plumb doesn't make sense. I'll give the filmmakers points for using a scary atmosphere, but they go so overboard on trying to the make the film look gloomy that they ruin everything. We've got every type of horror movie film technique in the first five minutes, blaring techno and industrial music in inappropriate places, and a conclusion that makes as much sense as the Clinton presidency. And what was up with that shower scene? What girl would take a shower in this hellhole? And, more importantly, where in the HECK did that clean towel come from?!?

If you must know, there are extras on the disc. We get a trio of trailers for other movies, a collection of photo stills, and a twenty-minute behind the scenes look at the making of the film. This laughable extra forces us to listen to the inane ramblings of the actresses as well as the rantings of the filmmakers. We're told, in all seriousness, about real hauntings during the film shoot. They even throw up some pictures of ghosts (You mean that shadow on the wall?) and EVP recordings taken inside the hospital (sounds like wind to me). I could go on and on, but I won't. ""Death Tunnel,"" which did get a few decent reviews from critics who should know better, gets a single star from me. It's derivative, pedantic drivel that deserves an even worse place than the discount bin at the dollar store.

2470177,2,B000CQQI8U,"Death Tunnel (Philip Adrian Booth, 2005)

I finished watching this movie and thought to myself, ""Man, this was a movie with so very much potential, and every last bit of it was strangled, frame by frame, with the kind of glee that only the truly incompetent can manage.""

Yes, I thought that. In exactly those words. So don't get on me about it, okay?

Plotwise, the beginning of the movie is rather confusing, but then maybe some colleges do things differently than mine did. Richie (Undressed's Jason Lasater), the charismatic leader of some sort of campus social club, emcees a party at which five girls are chosen to spend five hours during the night at a local, supposedly haunted, abandoned hospital-- Devon (Melanie Lewis, who has the disticntion of having appeared in both Gigli AND From Justin to Kelly!), Elizabeth (Yolanda Pecroraro in her first big-screen role), Ashley (Cemetery Gates' Kristin Novak), Tori (TV character actor Annie Burgstede), and Heather (Disconnect's Steffany Huckaby). There's a lot of foreshadowing kind of stuff that makes very little sense, given how little we actually learn about these women (and everyone else) before we get to the hospital, but I was willing to overlook that because the stuff intercut with all the foreshadowing and attempts at character building was quite intriguing-- newspaper clips flying around the screen about the depravity at the hospital, voiceovers, hints at assorted nastiness, that sort of thing. It rather seemed the filmmakers were going to do something more interesting with the backstory than they were with what was happening in the present, which would certainly have been an interesting approach. This, of course, went out the window pretty quick once we got everyone to the hospital itself. There the movie becomes your basic supernatural-slasher flick, with more time spent on devising interesting ways to do people in than with such trivialities as plot, characterization, pacing, and the like. And, of course, we get the typical, predictable ending with one surviving character, one redeemed villain, and the oh-so-surprising revelation that you saw coming five minutes into the film.

We have recently been blessed with a number of fantastic microbudget indie horror films (Deadbirds immediately comes to mind); Death Tunnel, despite all the possibilities inherent in it, is not one of them.

Death Tunnel is a B Grade slasher flick with a somewhat NIN flavor to it. If you take that mindset, you won't be disappointed. The plot is superficial, the actors relatively unskilled but the cinematography aint too bad. Plot well....that's pretty superficial too but hey it's a slasher film.

Five college girls fall victim to a sorority hazing gone bad. The hazing is hosted in the Vanguard TB Sanatorium (aka Waverly Hills), 3 frat boys in coercion with the school's preppy sorority queen set the girls up for 5 hours of spooky horror...only to have it hijacked by a truly malevolent corporeal spirit and his flock of disembodied specters. All participants have links to the Sanatorium's past and the evil Dr. Vanguard's machinations. How many will live? How many will die? Is escape possible? Will the plot congeal? Nudity bloodshed it's all there which doesn't make it appropriate for the young folk but good for a Halloween film party.

When all is said and done, I think Phil Booth said it best...""the place (Waverly) makes the movie"". He had a theme, atmosphere and cinematography but a poor plotline.

I picked this up after seeing both the ""Ghost Hunters"" and ""Sony Waverly Hills- Spooked"" specials on Sci-Fi Channel. Frankly I had no real expectations and really wasn't disappointed but it leaves me wondering what both the Booth Brother's and Mattinglys did to coerce Sony into making this film? They're definitely to be commended on their entrepreneurial talents and with a little guidance the Booth brothers could actually do pretty good in the horror film industry.

Well, the acting was pretty bad for sure and the bad girl was just sooo bad, she was horrible, and I don't mean in a good way.  She was just a terrible choice for that part.  I knew early on that this film was in trouble when the invitation to the sorority initiation instructed the Kentucky cutie coeds to wear their sheerest baby doll negligees.  Always a bad sign.  5 coeds, 5 floors and 5 hours.  Seemed like a theme.  Seemed like it anyway.

Death Tunnel is the story of 5 college girls who, seeking an initiation into a party clique, are picked into a hazing ceremony which leads them to an old hospital where white plague victims were slaughtered. The building holds much more than they suspect, including angry (and dull!) ghosts. From here the madness ensues and the blood flows.

Death Tunnel drags after the first 30 minutes, and holds few frights. The story gets dull once the girls are trapped, for nothing really happens other than 45 minutes of filming tricks. During this time we are tortured with an abundance of horrible acting; some of the worst in an horror film I have seen this year. The acting leaves you scratching your head, wondering how any film studio will give a director/producer $2 million to make Death Tunnel and allow them to squander the money on junk talent.

And in the end, that is what kills Death Tunnel: pitiful acting. The acting is scary, the movie isn't. Run away from this stinker. Run very, very far away and don't look back.

There was so little sustenance here as to barely even constitute a movie. I found myself fascinated, more so because the story dealt with five nubile coeds in lingerie. I guess I'm just the sentimental type.

The movie involved five coeds being drawn together, dressed in little lingerie outfits each with one letter to spell the word D-E-A-T-H. Chills. The blood goes cold.

The Good: Crap aficionados may recognize the pixyishly attractive Heather as the prettiest girl from the abysmally abortive Scarecrow Gone Wild; she was the girl who was chased through the haystack labyrinth only to die as a precursor to the rest of the movie. Admittedly, I was also strongly drawn to the plump little villainess Ashley, who wasted no time in getting naked. Her dialogue did make me cringe, but I didn't care, I soldiered right on through it. Also, I'd like to mention Devon, a sultry exotic creature who balanced nicely against the two feisty blondes.

The Bad: With the exception of the coeds, everyone else made me nostalgic for the time I had my wisdom teeth removed. The suck factor was the dominant beast, I'm sorry to say, a terrible ravening entity, consuming everything with its vacuous force. Pretty much all of the supernatural element was a watered-down version of the same stuff from the remake of The House On Haunted Hill. I watched the documentary also included on the disk, and the filmmakers claimed to have actually put various recorded phantasma inside the movie. I watched it again, and lost my focus in favor of the coeds once again.

The Ugly: Zero focus. No cohesive element. No drive. No irony. They relied too much on the presence of the dank and virulent hospital itself, which was at least effective in its own rite, but not enough to glue the movie together. But you can get the same effect from Session 9, while simultaneously getting a terse and edgy movie in the process. I think the word plot is N/A in this particular situation, but further disappointments included the unexplained goggle-ghost that prowled the hospital throughout the movie with a clean-up cart, the ghost of the evil doctor who was literally a clich-spewing machine, and the death tunnel itself, the purported focus of the entire movie---which got less play than poor doe-eyed Heather during her bit part in Scarecrow Gone Wild.

Would I recommend this movie? I don't feel qualified to say.

2470189,1,B000CQQI8U,If I could rate this movie below one star I would.  It is poorly written and acted.  Do not waste your time or money on this one.,1145318400,,129,3.740740740740741
2470190,2,B000CQQI8U,"After watching this flick, I had to ask myself why.  Why did I think this would be even entertaining?  Why did I pass up other movies that I've actually heard of to watch this?  I suppose I don't really have answers, but I will shy away from such movies in the future.

Okay, the movie had promise.  The plot sounded good.  The background sounded really good.  If this was a true story (the sanitarium, anyway), it would be an interesting bit of history.  I guess I should have known the acting would be subpar.  But the movie as a whole was subpar...a true triple bogey.

There were a few good scares here and there.  The problem was that these scares were shown three, four times.  It stopped being frightening after the first time.  The credits state that the film was ""shot, cut, and directed by.""  That, at least, was accurate.  There was much cutting and pasting.  Flash backs, flash forwards, flash whatevers.  I would bet that the 90+ minute movie consisted of 50 minutes of actual footage.

I do not recommend this movie.  I found myself hoping it would be over.  The ending was not good...just a cheap, ""bet you didn't see that coming"" scene that elisted a yawn from me.",1145232000,,1180,4.502369668246446
2470191,2,B000CQQI8U,"It's my fault, I have no one to blame but myself. I have been watching these direct-to-video titles for over 10 years, and once in a while you stumble on gold (Dog Soldiers comes to mind) but most of them are really, really, bad. So with that in mind I bring you the crap that is Death Tunnel, a movie that pitches us a strong premise, but strikes out big time with it's delivery. 5 girls are sorta kidnapped and asked to spend the night in a haunted sanatorium, 5 girls, 5 floors, 5 hours, cute huh? Of course they are scantilly clad, which I usually don't have a problem with, but here it's really quite un-necessary. The women are very attractive but have the acting talents, of, well, Paris Hilton comes to mind. The male lead actor, no need to tell you his name, you'll never see him again, is sad as well.

This movie could have been really scary and alot of fun in the right hands, but it only accomplishes giving whoever watches it a big headache and maybe even a seizure. The switch way too much between past and present, and cut away so fast scene to scene that is literally starts to make your head hurt. They try so hard to be shocking and disturbing that they forgot what makes a good horror film scary, and that is music, settings, lighting and imagery, of which this movie has none. The ending is infuriating, they go through this awful night of 'terror' and yet decide to stay in the sanatorium to find a cure for the disease that lead to the death tunnel, absurd.

This movie is actually based on true events, there was a White Plague in Kentucky in 1910 and they built a 500 foot tunnel to hide all the bodies because the founders of the sanatorium didn't want the public to know that the cures and experiments were not working. Supposedly this sanatorium is haunted in real life with many guests claiming to see some of the former patients and even the evil doctor at times. My gut feeling is if this had been made by an experienced documentary crew, this would have had more effect on it's viewers, the scare premise is there, the tortured past is there, ghosts and haunted houses always draw people, so it might have worked. But here is doesn't, we are left with coeds and gore, and while that sometimes is fun, it failed here.

acting....1.5 stars, Non-existent, but atleast they look cute right?

directing....1 star, Should have been a documentary

special effects.....2.5 stars, Decent, the ball scene was cool

scare rating.....1.5 stars, Your head will feel scary

quality.....2.5 stars, Looks pretty good, decent colors, minimal grain, sanatorium itself looks a little creepy.",1144195200,,2604,4.575107296137339
2470192,1,B000CQQI8U,"I decided to take a risk and rent Death Tunnel even though I normally stay completely away from horror films that are released directly to video.  No matter how huge of a horror fan I consider myself, I cannot spend money on some of the crap that somehow gets made into an actual film.  The only reason I decided to take a chance with Death Tunnel was because I read an article abou the film in a recent issue of Fangoria magazine.  The article was interesting, and the film sounded like it could actually be pretty cool.  It sounded really similar to Session 9, which is one of my favorite horror films.  And normally the straight-to-video films actually have pretty good (but still cheap) gore.  Let me just say that this movie is the poster child for why any horror film that goes directly to video is automatically going to suck.

The film takes place in the Vanguard Sanatorium, which housed victims of the ""white death.""  The head doctor at Vanguard decided to hide the deaths of his patients by putting them in a ""death tunnel"" that was built below the building.  In present day, the institution is abandoned and, of course, haunted by the ghosts of the victims of the plague.  5 college girls are lucky enough to be part of a school initiation.  The initiation requires them to get through all 5 floors of the institution within 5 hours.  Add on the fratboy hero, and that gives us 6 possible victims for the institution's residents.

While the basis of the film isn't really that bad, the execution is terrible.  For the first hour, the viewer has absolutely no idea what is going on.  We don't know why these girls are being killed, and if there is any meaning to it all.  Of course, there is the big revelation at the end that all the characters are connected to the institution, therefore the ghosts are out for vengeance.

There are absolutely no original ideas here.  The main villain in the institution, the ""body collector,"" is an exact copy of Earl in House of 1000 Corpses.  I was half expecting him to pull off his mask to reveal a hideously deformed face spewing yellow goop, but I guess the filmmakers decided they had copied enough already.  The death scenes are horrible, with absolutely no good gore, and the acting is so bad that most of the ""scary"" scenes turn totally laughable.

I'm going to give straight-to-video one more chance when 2001 Maniacs is released, but Death Tunnel completely soured my opinion.  And if I wasn't already a horror geek, then this film could have soured my opinion of the whole genre.  Yes, it is that bad.",1143244800,2,2562,4.5701754385964914
2470193,2,B000CQQI8U,"I can't remember how I found the website a few years ago. After years of pushing the release date back we finally get a straight to DVD release of the horror movie filmed in a real haunted sanitorium. Personally I was more interested in seeing thier Documentary on the Building called ""Spooked"", which I am not sure if it's been released yet. Death Tunnel is exaclty what I expected it to be when I see the trailer years ago. A movie about a bunch of half naked college students, who can't act, screaming thier way through a haunted sanitorium. To say it's anything deeper is is absurd.

As you'll see when the film begins, the movie claims to be based off a true story. Death Tunnel itself refers to the 500ft tunnel that was used to transport thousands of dead bodies durning a outbreak of the White Plague in kentucky. Though the name and geographic location of the building are changed, the history behind the building is mainly true, and even the ghosts you'll see in the film are based off the ghosts that people have claimed to see while visiting Waverly. Everything else is fabricated. 5 girls are...well kidnapped, and put into an initiation rite called ""Truth or Scare"", where they must spend 5 hours locked in the haunted sanitorium, all the while being watched on closed circuit cameras by the boys who put them there...why the abondoned building has working electricity isn't expalined.

There's one or two well executed scares, but the atmosphere of the film didn't really put me on edge. There was a nice attempt at the editing but by the time of it's release, it had been done by so many others that it didn't really impress me at all. As a matter of fact, it made it kind of generic. The acting could only be worse if they had used people off the street. The parts didn't really require much acting skill, so I would have to point the finger at the director for not getting a better performance out of the cast. The writing for this movie definitly isn't going to get any recongnition. The plot-line direction is horribly concieved and I found myself laughing at the end of the film. Not a movie to run out and ""blind-buy"", but give it a rent if your a horror fanatic.",1143158400,,2185,4.515151515151516
2470194,4,B000CQQI8U,"I have been waiting for this movie to come out for about 2 years now.  I am an amature ghost hunter and have done research on the waverly hills sanitorium that the movie is based on.  Most of the ""ghost stories"" mentioned in the movie are actually part of the history of the building.  Some parts of the plot were a little weak, but the direction and editing were outstanding. I highly recommend it.",1141862400,2,399,4.364864864864865
2470195,5,B000CQQI8U,"The votes are in!......""Recently rented the new movie ""Death Tunnel"". It presents an extremely impressive visual style combined with top notch kinetic editing work. I'll admit, it made me jump more than once and without any slowdowns. So far my favorite release this year. I'm sure we'll hear more from this team, and I'll be first in line. I must admit, I hate when I see critics just dismiss great editing work in film as ""music video style"".... my guess is they haven't come out of the past to accept the new age of film-making. My only criticism is the DVD cover art doesn't do the movie justice. A passing consumer would most likely pass this great release up if relying on shelf shopping. A much better cover image would have been a rendering of the gasmask demon in the film. So great job to the team, although the cover art looses Marketing points. Fans of great visual horrific kinetics should buy this release!
