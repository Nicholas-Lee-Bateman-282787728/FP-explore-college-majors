I want to recommend Angelique to all you who love life, joy, adventure and truly good entertainment.
I wonder why it never reached the New World - United States and it still  not known here. But maybe one day it will come to touch hearts of American audience as it has been in Europe for many, many years.
Once you get to know and see Angelique - You will enjoy her and whole the cast - I guarantee it!
Have fun - Angelique is a real heroine came to life  the film series are a real treat! Life is good with Angelique!

8026626,5,B0002DFL54,"I'm one lucky woman that my mother tongue is German and this fantastic historical film serie about the enchanting woman Angelique and written by Anne Golon, is at least available on Video in German. I really wonder why there never was an english version which is a big loss for all english speaking countries in my eyes. Angelique is an intricately woven tapestry of factual and fictional characters involved in the scent of 17th century French history. Completely missclassified as ""romanze"", in my opinion, I really prefer to emphase and value the serie's categorization into ""historical fiction"". Most of my knowledge about the Louis XIV era comes initially from my having read the books which is a total of 14 in its original editon (french) but only 9 of them got translated and published in english. In this postmodern time we live in, I really think it's about time to give it a whirl to experience the pain and pleasure of this unique fresco worldwide.... in english, please!!!!",1106092800,25,986,4.875
