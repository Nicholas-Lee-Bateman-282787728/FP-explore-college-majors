8277058,5,B001AD6UHI,"A great Poverty Row horror gem, with a very menacing Erich Von Stroheim in the title role, and shocker of shockers, Dwight Frye, a man whose career was built on playing simpering servants and mad menaces, really gets a chance to shine as the protagonist. If you're a Frye fanatic like I am, I highly recommend this movie.",1509062400,,321,4.551724137931035

8277061,5,B001AD6UHI,"The Crime of Dr. Crespi will have you wondering what else Dr. Crespi (Erich von Stroheim) does at the clinic besides smoke, do shots, and commit a ""crime"" or two. Dwight Frye is excellent as Dr. Thomas who is on to Dr. Crespi's crime. Despite abuse that should prompt him to call the employee hot-line, Dr. Thomas shows more nerve than his somewhat indifferent colleagues and sets out to prove Crespi's guilt. The way Dwight Frye shows Dr. Thomas' uneasiness toward Dr. Crespi in the beginning of the film really sets up the change his character undergoes from ""abused puppy"" to defiance to pity. Erich von Stroheim is most convincing as a wronged man with a festering desire for vengeance.",1447286400,2,690,4.758333333333334
8277062,5,B001AD6UHI,"When I read about this movie somewhere online about this movie being the absolute best Dwight Frye movie ever made, I just had to get it. After I got it and watched it, I cried my eyes out. That man is one of the best actors that ever lived, and this movie is the ultimate proof of all that talent. The first time I saw him was in Dracula in 1972, I was only 6 years old, and both he and Bela Lugosi made such an impression on me that I was in love with both of them ever since. Erik von Stroheim is another great actor, I saw him in another good oldie-but-goodie black-n-white movie 'Alraune the Unnatural'. the Crime Of Dr. Crespi has a nice overall greyness that's better than the sharpness of black-n-white, and it's better to see this movie as a matinee late in the afternoon on a rainy day so you can get the full impact of the gruesome horror of this movie. If you love the old dark horror movies, you'll love this one. Dwight Frye is in rare form.",1399248000,4,955,4.139784946236559
8277063,5,B001AD6UHI,"Almost in the category of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space,"" this is a poorly edited, insanely directed early talkie with the great Dwight Frye in one of his best roles as a blithering idiot; and Erich von Stroheim inexplicably unconvincing as an impossibly arrogant, murderous, haughty and sadistic surgeon, chain-smoking between nefarious deeds. Nonsequiturs, lousy editing, inane dialogue, implausible situations, a  ""point-of-view"" premature burial, a laughable lady-in-distress, cliches and a dumb plot converge to make this one of the most entertaining ""lost treasures"" for lovers of really rotten cinema.",1371427200,2,603,5.775280898876405
8277064,1,B001AD6UHI,"I bought this dvd because I heard it was a good copy worth buying. It's not even black & white, it's gray & white and pretty badly faded to boot. I kept it anyway.",1325635200,3,163,3.823529411764706
8277065,4,B001AD6UHI,"This 1935 horror classic delivers in a big way!  Like any good vintage horror, it manages to be quite horrorfying without being gorey!

Von Stroheim is pefection itself in the role of the villianous, jealousy ridden Dr Crespi!

The film has not been digintally restored, but it is in very good condition.

This in an excellent addition to anyone's classic film collection.",1285632000,7,372,4.951612903225806
