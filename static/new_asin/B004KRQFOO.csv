4398060,1,B004KRQFOO,"If this item was renamed in a truthful manner, it would be ""One Third Earth From Above, One Third Interviews With Tree Huggers and One Third Poor Quality Stock Video"".  Extremely disappointed by this purchase.",1323907200,14,209,4.9714285714285715
4398061,5,B004KRQFOO,"This was a really fun video with some amazing imagery, and, surprisingly, it proved to be a fun way to learn about water conservation-- and similar issues-- which I hadn't really thought about before.  I know conservation can be a contentious subject, but I thought the filmmaker laid out his arguments in a clear, sensible way, and I really learned a lot.  There was also a lot of humor in the series, which I wasn't expecting.  Arthus-Bertrand is a charismatic and clever guy, in addition to seeming smart on environmental issues.  But at the end of the day, I bought this because I was looking for nature photography from a new perspective I hadn't seen before, and in that, for me, this title 100% delivered.",1304899200,7,712,4.672
4398062,1,B004KRQFOO,"I like Yann Arthus-Bertrand's photography and own several of his books -- including Earth From Above -- which is why I was excited when this film was released. However, Yann needs to stay behind the camera. This film is technically inaccurate on many levels and horribly slanted. Yes, documentaries generally have an agenda, so there is an inherent bias. However, one cannot compare what is happening with the Colorado River and what happened to the Aral Sea. Yes, there are problems with the way the United States wastes water, but it has nothing to do with the water shortages in the Middle East and Africa. The problem with the Colorado River water sharing agreement between the seven western states in the United States is that the allocations were made during years of unusually high rain levels, so that when rain levels drop to normal or below normal, more water is being removed than is being put into the basin. Yann never explains this phenomenon. Likely, neither he nor anyone else on this project bothered to study western water policy in the United States. With regard to Jordan, Israel, the Dead Sea, etc. They are in a desert. They're simply cursed by geography. Trying to mix these situations and preach to the masses about wasteful are our water practices is a pathetic attempt at environmental consciousness. Misinformation like this doesn't help any of us who care about the environment or are involved in environmental policy. It hurts only hurts the cause.",1303689600,21,1477,4.912

8433309,5,B004KRQFOO,"I thought it was a very informational documentary about how we need to conserve our water .
  I think when I was in grade school we focused more on conservation than we teach our children today.
  But we'll worth the money and good for a family or a single parent and their kids to sit down and watch and discuss the issues facing them in their lifetime.",1471910400,,354,4.2388059701492535

8433311,5,B004KRQFOO,"This is an excellent programme from a distinguished environmental figure.  The Photography is excellent in Blu ray, while the storyline is passionate and this has led to a number of negative reviews, there is more right than wrong and the fundamental issue is important and will continue to be so with increasing populations in various areas of the world.",1391558400,,355,5.016949152542373
8433312,1,B004KRQFOO,"Worst piece of crap i have ever bought. Yann arthus Bertrand is a self centered egotist who has no idea how to make a documentary. Very little of this program is ""ABOVE EARTH"".It's more about him in front of the camera. AVOID this series of disks,save your money!",1363996800,7,263,4.5
8433313,1,B004KRQFOO,I love Planet Earth and all the BBC nature shows on Blu-Ray but this one is in a league of its own.  Really bad.  You're better off getting any other program even if you see this one really cheap.  The endless interviews are boring beyond belief.  The HD nature footage is very sparse.,1329696000,10,285,4.320754716981132
