8442570,4,B004V2FUT4,"Sanjeev Kumar's nine roles here represents 'Navras', the different moods of man as per the Indian art ethos. This is his film all the way. He play lover, a brave hunter, an epileptic, a coward, a transvestite, a drunkard, a poetic heart and so on. Now more than twenty years after his death, when one reassess Sanjeev Kumar, this film certainly stands among his best. Yet the sense of dissatisfaction remains as what else could be called among his best. Apart from 'Dastak', 'Andhi', 'Koshish', 'Arjun Pandit', 'Shatranj ke Khiladi' and a few others, his repertoire is not that full as it should have been.

Anyway, in this one you will find all that satisfy your entertainment gene. Film is an amalgamation of all the drama, a Bombay spicy movie is supposed to have. Being a Sanjeev Kumar show, there is hardly any scope for anyone else to do something, yet Jaya Bhadhuri is in good form here and its through her character the story is told.

Nice Sunday treat.",1305849600,2,962,4.652941176470589
