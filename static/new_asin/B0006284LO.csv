2159484,5,B0006284LO,George did it again with another great exercise program. The boxing moves adds variety and fun. I would recommend it for anyone wanting to get in shape.,1116979200,5,152,4.666666666666667
2159485,4,B0006284LO,"Walk and Box is an enjoyable workout that can be modified for every fitness level. It gives an all over workout without being high impact, and also incorporates intervals to help boost fitness level. The intervals are 1 minute periods of running in place, or jumping rope in place and really get your pulse rate up. You can go all out, or keep the workout at a lower fitness level -- Foreman stresses for everyone to do what they can do.

I love this workout because it's fun and also because it's a great workout for my legs, waist and butt. There aren't any fancy moves to confuse the less coordinated. Anyone can do this workout. Just have fun!",1107216000,16,647,4.436974789915967
2159531,5,B0006284LO,"So far I love all the George Forman dvd's. I truly break a sweat whether small or big. It's great for my knees which truly helps since I can no longer do floor exercises.  Just go at your own pace and do your best, and before you know it, the work out is over.",1382918400,,260,3.814814814814815
2159532,3,B0006284LO,I like the  workout but the sound quality is lacking.  Music is too low so it's hard to get into a good workout mode.  Seems the sound comes and goes.,1357344000,,150,3.933333333333333
2159533,5,B0006284LO,"Love his workout videos...they aren't for extreme physical fitness die hards...but just great perfect moderate excercise that keeps you in shape, that you can gear up more if youd like more out of it...highly recommend!  Dont let George scare ya...he's a teddy bear!",1355529600,,266,5.186046511627907
2159534,3,B0006284LO,"it gets boring.....seems very disorganized....it doesn't seem to have a good flow. I did not enjoy it. I loved the bursts where you jump or whatever. But overall, there are better dvds out there. Even his circuit walk is better than this one",1350086400,,241,4.627906976744186
2159535,5,B0006284LO,"My wife and i popped this dvd in the other night instead of going on our daily walk because of the sun,heat, and humitity. we enjoyed it and it is a little better than our daily walk. I have always been a huge fan of George as an athlete and a person. what a great guy! This is a fun dvd that gives you a nonstressfull workout that i believe if done every other day you would see results in fat loss! Good activity for the whole family.",1342396800,,436,3.965909090909091
2159536,4,B0006284LO,"I lead an exercise group for men, and this video got positive reviews.  It's appropriate for varying fitness levels - good encouragement and pacing.  The instructions were not always clear, though.",1307145600,,197,5.32258064516129
2159537,3,B0006284LO,"If you are starting a workout program (or getting back into working out -- like I am), this DVD is a great one to usse. There is walking and a tiny bit of punching. You will not know your distance, but if you decide how much time you want to start with and set your own timer, and increase it each day, you will not be sore. I recommend this for the beginner -- or someone who needs to walk inside 'with a group' on their days off of a reguar routine.",1304553600,,451,3.9130434782608696
2159538,5,B0006284LO,"I recently obtained this workout DVD and was excited to give it a try. I have various workout DVDS (Leslie Sansone, The Biggest Loser, Jillian Michaels, etc), but have recently had an interest in boxing style workouts. I was very pleased with the workout. It is what I would consider medium intensity, and it's long enough to make a difference (about 45 minutes), but not TOO long to get boring. George keeps you motivated, Petra is easy to follow along with, and the other cast members/exercisers bring energy to the workout. I would recommend this workout to anyone looking for a fun way to get in shape.",1253232000,2,606,4.672897196261682
2159539,4,B0006284LO,"I like this video, it's a good low impact workout.  I like the fact that it's 45 minutes which helped me get to the next level in my workout from 30 minutes a day.  Even though the video is easy/low impact, it's still a great workout because of the 30 second interval burst of high/intense impact exercise.  I'm sweating by the end of the video.  It's also a little funny.",1241049600,2,372,4.271428571428571
2159540,3,B0006284LO,"I didn't like it as well as 'Walk & Box'.  The footwork was trickier, and there weren't the speed bursts which have been proven to increase the overall results of your workout.  It's okay, but I definitely prefer the other.",1202860800,3,223,4.55
2159561,5,B0006284LO,This workout is a favorite in my workout collection.  I found myself having a fun time listening to George's jokes as we boxed and walked.  His fun sense of humor along with Petra's light-hearted personality makes this workout a must for any exerciser.  The workout is an effective workout with an added bonus of boxing with a champ. I am looking forward to trying some of the other programs in George's collection. I would recommend this workout program for every level of exerciser.,1196726400,3,484,4.807228915662651
2159562,4,B0006284LO,"This tape is mainly for people trying to get back in shape.  You can also kick it up a few notches with George's professional exercise partner or pace-it-yourself with the other group of exercisers. I first rented this DVD from the library and found myself re-ordering it about 3 times.  I decided to go ahead a finally purchase it.  Luckily, I found it at an unbeatible price on Amazon.($2.95) Unopened, and new from a Amazon seller.  I would never pay 19.99 for this video when others are offering it cheaper.  Might as well go to Walmart if that is the case.  I thought the point here was buying it cheaper!  Anyway, look for a deal on this DVD because exercise tapes are a dime-a-dozen.  And 19.99 is just too much to pay for this DVD.",1191196800,,739,4.4222222222222225
2159563,5,B0006284LO,"My husband and I got hooked on the George Foreman series of walk dvd's and this one is particularly good.  The steps are easy to do and although it makes you sweat you can make it all the way through--and we aren't in terrific shape.  The boxing burst intervals get your heart rate up but you can do it any way you want--so you make it as easy or hard as you want to workout.  Also, they only last a minute so although they're intense they don't last too long.  The punches make it fun and I think my husband likes this dvd best because the boxing makes it seem more masculine.  George encourages you throughout and seems like a truly nice guy.",1185408000,6,644,4.203252032520325
2159564,5,B0006284LO,"Very enjoyable dvd, not too hard but keeps the energy up throughout. George is fun and personable, and the other instructor is great too.
I like that there are different body types in the class and they all are doing a little different intensity so you can pick a choose a person to follow depending on how you feel.",1185408000,4,316,4.372881355932203
2159565,4,B0006284LO,"I like low intensity cardio workouts like Leslie Sansone, but do get bored of them, so I'm always looking for something new.  I didn't really enjoy Circuit Walk, because of the constant squats/lunges, but thought it had promise so I decided to try this one.  It was A LOT more intense than I was expecting, mainly because I'm not used to jumping/hopping for a minute straight.

This workout is led by George Forman and Petra Kolber.  Mostly Petra just talks about how great George is and George has a great time playing it up for the camera. The steps are fairly simple--marching in place, marching back and forth, step touches, and bob and weaves.  Basic punches are also added in (jab, cross, hook), but for a workout called ""walk and box"" there was surprisingly little upper body work.  Interspersed throughout this workout were ""boxing blasts"" which were short intervals of jumping or jogging in place.  I found these quite challenging and my heartrate was up the whole time as a result, even though the rest of the workout was not that difficult.

At nearly 45 minutes, this workout is a bit long and not something I can do on weekdays.  I did enjoy it, although I wish there were more variety overall in the steps and I wish there were some kicking.  For a walking/kickboxing fusion workout, I prefer Leslie Sansone's Walk and Kick.",1181433600,6,1338,4.67948717948718
2159566,1,B0006284LO,"What a horribly produced workout DVD.  There are actually TWO instructers during this workout -- George and Petra.  They constantly talk over one another so you have no idea what you are supposed to be doing.  Petra has a horrible, NY/Boston accent and a rough voice.  There is very little to no direction or instruction.  ""Let's do a bob and weave,"" Petra says.  And a bob and weave is what??  You think you might explain it a bit?  Her cueing is absolutely non-existent.  ""Walk it off with this leg"" she says.  However, she doesn't point to one or the other leg or the camera isn't on her, so you have no idea in which direction to go.  The moves are terribly repetitive.  The ""boxing bursts"" are a joke.  ""Just do what you feel like doing.""  It's a bunch of people jumping around flailing their arms tapping, jumping and hoppping from one foot to the other.  I'd do better on my own just walking around the block.",1177459200,3,916,4.433734939759036

2159568,5,B0006284LO,"I love this video!  I wish there were more of them to buy.  My son (who is 12 and very overweight) and I had circuit walk first, we loved it, so we bought the walk and box and now he is excited to excercise monday thru thursday!! Gotta love that!  Thanks George",1173312000,4,261,3.980769230769231
2159569,5,B0006284LO,"This is the second video I've tried from the Walk It Off with George series; again, I found working out with George to be both fun AND a great workout!  Walk and Box offers a basic walking workout but adds interest with a few boxing moves--mostly boxer shuffles and basic punches--as well as ""boxing blasts,"" which are four 1-minute higher intensity bursts interspersed throughout the workout.

Although George is a prominent feature during the video, the workout is actually led by veteran instructor Petra Kolber, with George making occasional motivational comments throughout. Petra begins with a basic aerobic warm-up that is approximately 6 minutes long; however, I found that the warm-up quickly raised my heart rate into the fat-burning zone.  The main body of the workout consists of very simple steps such as the basic walk (marching in place), side steps, boxer shuffles, and the ""Foreman shuffle"" (marching forward and back with a tap).  Petra relies on George to introduce the punches--jab, hook, and uppercut--and then she incorporates a ""fitness"" version of each.  During the higher intensity drills, Petra gives you various options, including a fast walk/shuffle, jogging, or mock jumping rope.  The workout ends with a 4 minute cool-down which consists of two minutes of slowing the heart rate followed by two minutes of stretching.

I am an intermediate exerciser, so this workout was a bit on the easy side for me, but I had no problems modifying the intensity to meet my needs (eg, adding weighted gloves, making the movements bigger and more bouncy, incorporating knee lifts, etc.) and thus keeping my heart rated elevated throughout the entire workout.  As compared to Leslie Sansone's walking workouts, I find the Walk It Off with George series to be more fun:  the music is more upbeat, George is a big goofball, and he and Petra have a great rapport.  Overall, this was a very enjoyable workout that I know I will use often--highly recommended!",1136419200,18,1968,5.046296296296297
2159570,4,B0006284LO,"I love the videoIt takes some getting used to at first, but I think it's fun and it really makes you sweat. I love the 30 second burst where you kind of do your own thing. In all I like it.",1136246400,5,189,3.6341463414634148

8036981,5,B0006284LO,"George Foreman and Petra Kohlber work together to lead a group friends in a non-dancey, do-able aerobic workout.  The jump rope segments are particularly effective in getting the heart rate up, but you don't have to jump if you don't like high impact.  They don't actually use a real jump rope, but pretend to be jumping rope.  The workout lasts about 45 minutes, with a warm up and cool down and stretch.  I enjoyed it.",1411344000,2,420,4.56

8036983,5,B0006284LO,"The video is lead by Petra and George and is very easy to follow and adapt to all fitness levels.  George who was a profesional boxer
demonstrates some of his signature moves as a boxer,ie, upper cut, bob and weave etc.  Petra is great!  She tells you the move
ahead of time and demonstrates each move before the sequence, all done to fun music that doesn't disrupt the flow of the routines.
If you follow her directions correctly (which she demonstrates), you will work your entire body, legs, upper body and waist.  This routine is 46 minutes long but it goes by fast because there are 4 exercise burst (interval training) mixed in between the boxing routines to get your heartrate up.  The moves are fun but also practical.  I can definitely use the same moves as self defence in the real world.  Fun way to learn boxing moves and get in shape at the same time.",1391644800,2,864,4.464968152866242
