Yes, its great to see Karajan's conducting, BUT I don't need to just see him ONLY for the duration of the entire recording. Nor am I satisfied merely to be given glimpses of the various sections of the orchestra playing. Certainly not when the entire orchestra is playing! Wonder whose idiotic idea is this to allow us merely peeks here and there as if through the keyhole? Ought to be SHOT! One star, because I didn't get a video recording - its only as good as an audio one..... Fume!!!!",1261958400,3,659,4.5
7914447,5,B00000K4ZX,"Beethoven's fifth, along with his seventh and ninth symphonies are, in my opinion, the best classical music ever written, and thus Beethoven the best composer ever.
Many ""experts"" argues that either Mozart or Bach is the best composer ever. My argument in favor of Beethoven is the following: most of the people begin to listen classical music after hearing the fifth or the ninth, and then they follow  with other Beethoven's pieces. Because the law of decreasing marginal pleasure after listen the same pieces many times, people begin to explore other composers, and then they arrive to Mozart or Bach. But the lure to listen classical music most of the times is Beethoven, and thus by democracy Beethoven is the best.
Regarding this performance of the fifth by Karajan, I will not refer to the quality of the image recording nor to the camera shootings, but to the quality of the music. Karajan performs and unsurpassable emotive, strength and full of passion version of the fifth. If one reads about Beethoven's live when he wrote the fifth, one would imagine that Beethoven would play the symphony with all the strength, sentiment and passion that Karajan does. The fifth, along with the ninth, are the most romantic of all pieces, because they really express the struggle in the soul of human beings towards goodness and triumph. No other music achieve the former as these two symphonies do, and no other performer is able to express Beethoven's feeling better than Karajan.",1080432000,4,1480,4.943775100401607
7914448,5,B00000K4ZX,"Wow! I was emotionally exhausted after viewing/listening to this DVD! The performances offerd by both Herbert von Karajan and the orchestra are astounding! As Gary Oldman said in Immortal Beloved: ""The nature of music is to put oneself into the mental state of the composer; it is like hypnotism!"" Herbert von Karajan _is_ in the mental state of the composer/s. 60+ years or so of conducting has given him an uncanny ability to interpert the composers music in a very personal way! His range of emotionall expressions as he conducts is astounding! It's like watching a man possessed by the music; enraptured by it..almost in a hypnotic state! I watch this disc over and over again not just for the music (which speaks for itself) but for the range of expressions one see's on Herr Karajan's face: from monster to empassioned prisoner of the music! Wow!!!",1046476800,4,854,4.8561643835616435
7914449,4,B00000K4ZX,"I never was a great fan of Karajan. All my favourite composers are better interpreted by someone else... I prefer Boehm, Davis, Marriner, Harnoncourt and Gardiner in Mozart; Pinnock and Hogwood in the baroque; Giulini, Serafin and Levine in Verdi. So, he wasn't ever a first choice.
But this symphony was a mark in my life: when I was a 10 year-old boy, I listened to a 33 rpm with Klemperer, and chosed to listen only classical music in my life. So, how can I resist to buy a DVD with the Fifth ???
Well, I'm satisfied. Although isn't my first choice (Kleiber or Wand), is a great job: I liked the life that Karajan brought to this music, but I doesn't like the noise of the arcs beating the strings every fast passage. But the Berliners are great musicians, and overall the result is very good.",1008633600,4,796,4.421768707482993
7914450,5,B00000K4ZX,"At this point, Sony has released all of its von Karajan performances of the Beethoven symphonies on five DVDs. They are all very good performances, created for film (rather than concert performance) in the early 80s.  Von  Karajan conducts the Berlin Philharmonic, his personal orchestra, and the  performance is as much von Karajan as Beethoven.  Musically, these are very  fine performances, with von Karajan in absolute control of the orchestra  which plays very precisely.  These are the performance as he wanted to  present them -- smooth, well thought-out, and note-perfect.
There is  probably no right way to put symphonic music onto film -- these productions  (made by conductor's own film company) spend most of their time focused on  the conductor with cut-away shots to both individual and groups of  instrumentalists (also singers in the 9th), usually focusing on the  instruments themselves rather than the players.
It is fascinating to  watch von Karajan -- his authority in the music and with this orchestra are  clear thoughout each performance.  He conducts without a baton and uses his  whole body to conduct, though not in a distracting way (I am thinking of  Leonard Bernstein here).
The sound and picture on these DVDs are  excellent; the sound is truly comparable to a well-recorded CD.  The  soundtrack is available both in stereo and also an excellent 5.1 Dolby mix.  The disks have a set of program notes and a biography of von Karajan.",962236800,10,1461,5.050420168067227

7914452,5,B00000K4ZX,"Karajan's version of the famous Beethoven's 5th is one of the most copied, well-know interpretations of this symphony. The noise of the arcs beating the strings is the signature of the Berliner Philharmoniker, and this  symphony give us plenty of these. There is nothing I could criticize about  this interpretation, it's just the way it should be, no less, no more. I  could almost see myself in my room, when I was a kid, conducting like krazy  an imaginary orchestra with the stereo at full volume. For those  unfortunate ones that knew this symphony from another orchestra/conductor,  listening to Karajan's version could be no less than a revelation. The  fourth is completely diferent in character, but equally impecable  performance. Buy these versions and you'll never have to buy another one.",953337600,11,801,5.107692307692307
