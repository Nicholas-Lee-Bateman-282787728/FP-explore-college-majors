7153782,5,B00WTBDDDE,"I saw this movie in 1977 while stationed at San Vito dei Normanni Air Station in Italy. I can honestly say this is one of the funniest movies ever!  Sid Caesar plays a classic role as a wounded Vet with severe ""shell shock"" still looking for Hitler from his hospital bed. All the actors have classic lines and bits.  While this movie is definitely not for everyone - if you liked Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, Bugs Bunny Cartoons, the Three Stooges, Bob Newhart,  and the Marx Brothers, etc then you will  like/love this movie. The critics blasted it which is probably the reason it took so long to come out on video - they're morons with boring senses of humor.",1453939200,3,669,4.55
7153783,5,B00WTBDDDE,One of my favorite movies of all time. It's definently worth checking out!,1450656000,,74,4.769230769230769
7153784,5,B00WTBDDDE,Alan Ark in writes the best movies. This is hysterical. Every person in this movie was cast perfectly. This will keep you laughing from beginning to end. Sad Caesar was the best!,1448064000,4,178,4.59375
7153785,5,B00WTBDDDE,"Very funny movie, this is the first time on video, if you like dumb comdy this is it.",1447027200,,85,3.7777777777777777
7153786,5,B00WTBDDDE,A very funny film that had limited release and was never converted to VHS. Great Cast!,1439078400,,86,4.4375
7153787,5,B00WTBDDDE,"Sloppily made, died at the box office, Leonard Maltin's guide gives it a BOMB rating.  Oh yeah, and it's the only movie to ever make me literally laugh myself sick.  Released (barely) in 1977, it's taken this long for it to see any sort of home video release (at least domestically).  From the author of ""Where's Poppa"" and ""Weekend at Bernie's,"" for the longest time this was my video holy grail, and one of those movies that I only saw because I worked in the theater where it played.  Get a group of friends together to watch this one, and be prepared for complaints from the neighbors about the noise.",1435017600,5,605,4.472727272727273
7153788,4,B00WTBDDDE,"Abrasive comedy some would call loud, possibly shrill, but I liked it.  Wacky over-the-top humor that may not be to all tastes but it registered with me.  Terrific ensemble cast with standouts being Rob Reiner as the nervous asthmatic younger son and Sid Caesar as the delusional uncle who still thinks he's fighting World War II.  Second directorial effort by star Alan Arkin, the first being ""Little Murders"", and he demonstrates an assured hand in orchestrating the broad antics in the film.  Dismissed in the ""Leonard Maltin Movie Guide"" with the BOMB rating which I consider harsh and inaccurate.",1433635200,8,601,5.040404040404041
8714149,5,B00WTBDDDE,"First saw this film when it  was released in 1977,  I always wanted to find when it would be  released by Fox on dvd, I thought it was a lost film? I 'm glad  to get this hard to find comedy on dvd, a great addition to my collection. Thanks!",1521763200,,241,3.76

8714153,5,B00WTBDDDE,"Like 30 years ago all the fam got together and watched this movie on TV and we laugh all the way through it. We watched it again during a rerun and stood as a funny family moment. So nice it was released on DVD!!! Thank you. Was about time. I guess that, for the movie companies, this release was at the end of the line because of blockbusters priorities but, I gotta thell you, this is one of those underrated comedies that I had the chance to discover.",1484697600,,454,4.170454545454546
