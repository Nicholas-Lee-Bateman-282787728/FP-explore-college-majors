This movie is about a nerd who needs to feel strong because his business is struggling so instead of acquiring an eating disorder himself, he foists one on his girlfriend.  So his goldwork isn't such a hot seller and he can't make appointments on time but he can make sure the scale is working properly and make sure the cookies in the cupboard are all accounted for.  The actress who played his girlfriend really lost weight during the course of filming as is evident from her nude scenes.  She actually wasn't fat to begin with.  At the beginning of their relationship, he leaves the big and beautiful bouquet of white flowers outside when he visits her because giving them to her might make her feel happy and he somehow would have less power over her?  He really is a nerd and a loser who throws away good things in favor of dogma and prejudice.

OK for viewing but not worth buying",1166918400,,915,4.509090909090909

8060678,2,B0009HBPEY,"I concurr with the other reviewer that this film lacks depth.  It certainly had potential to be a juicy psycholigical thriller, but instead this movie is dry as a bone.  There were about 20 minutes of interesting scenes stretched out over 90 minutes.  The film isn't much to look at either.  I only give it two stars because the concept is fascinating, otherwise it is a one-star flick.

Maybe the novel this book was based upon is worth reading?",1150070400,,446,4.594936708860759
8060679,4,B0009HBPEY,"Writer/director Matteo Garrone has created in PRIMO AMORE yet another atmospheric film (not unlike 'L'Imbalsamatore') that deftly explores the dark side of human interactions and motivations.  His style is gothic in nature but with a contemporary setting manipulated with quirky camera work and artistically designed sets that give the viewer the feeling of watching an experiment in a laboratory, the characters all being  bounded by cage-like visual devices.  Yes, this is film noir, but Garrone develops his bizarre characters so well that we grow along with their transformations into the icons they become.

Vittorio (Vitaliano Trevisan) is a goldsmith who exists on the modest, long-held family business of creating jewelry from molten gold in the ancient manner.  We first meet him looking through the grid of a train station where he awaits Sonia (Michela Cescon), a young girl who has answered his classified ad for a date.  They meet, Sonia is pleased, but Vittorio tells her right away that he expected her to be thinner.  Sonia offers to return to her home out of town, a garden home she shares with her robust brother (Roberto Comacchio), but Vittorio decides he wants to try the date.  They have a little courtship and all seems to go well until Vittorio begins to suggest that Sonia lose weight.  They move into a nice home ('the site of Romeo and Juliet' the realtor boasts) and their coexistence begins.

Vittorio is confronted with the needs of his business expanding stimulated by an offer to partner his business from an entrepreneur who insists Vittorio make only heavy bracelets and substantial jewelry in response to what the public is buying: Vittorio has always preferred the tiny, thin, light weight delicate carvings of beauty rather than the bulkier profitable items.  The decision causes Vittorio's two old workers to leave him and Vittorio is depressed.

As Sonia complies with Vittorio's ongoing obsession for her to be thin, Sonia's friends and brother tell her to beware of the strange demands of Vittorio, and despite Sonia's hunger for food, her hunger for being loved is greater and she slowly moves toward anorexia. Eventually in the solitary confinement of their home the two come into conflict and the result is a tragedy few would see coming.

The layers of meaning are deep: Vittorio's passion for the thin, delicate gold objects he creates as being things of true beauty are mirrored by his obsession for Sonia to be like those objects.  Sonia works as  a model for an art school and as she watches the students' works alter her once nubile body to a dwindling form, she feels terrified that she will waste away.  Yet her need to not be rejected by Vittorio keeps her starving her body rather than her heart.  Throughout this downward spiral of physical vs emotional attraction Garrone frames the scenes in increasingly complex grids, confining the story every more tightly until the ultimate rupture.

The acting is excellent and the combination of scene design and cinematography make this a dark but intensely interesting film experiment.  It may not be a movie for everyone, but for those who appreciate avante garde stories and cinematic treatment, this is a film to study.  Grady Harp, May 06",1146528000,3,3240,5.009328358208955
8060680,3,B0009HBPEY,"I slipped on the same banana peel with Garrone's ""Primo Amore"". His previous work ""The Embalmer"" had a great opportunity to be an outstanding film, but unfortunately it didn't live up to my expectations. It was advertized much more interestingly than the film itself actually turned out to be. Though the idea was quite good. Same thing with ""Primo amore"" (First Love). I decided to buy it firstly because I saw some potential in ""The Embalmer"" and secondly because the plot seemed rather intriguing. And I was a bit disappointed again. Don't get me wrong - I think the story itself was fascinating, the acting was just superb, beautiful music helped creating really magnificent atmosphere. It was the execution of the story that lacked.

Vittorio is looking for an ideal woman meaning both body and mind. Problem is his ideal should weigh the least possible. 40kg would be fine. So when he finds Sonja who he begins to live with, he starts looking after her weight pushing her to lose it. Seems Sonja is OK with it, so she follows his orders, but it's obvious this kind of a story can only end tragically...

Nice story-line skids all the time, it lacks some action besides I couldn't get the characters' motivation. Seems like they are not normal people but somnambulists who don't act on their own according to their desires but obey a puppeteer-director. ""Primo amore"" is viscous and slow, all the time I wished I could hit the gas. Usually this kind of slow-moving features have a great psychological level which you got to dig out. Well, here I didn't notice any psychology. If we could just see feelings of the two main characters, if we could understand their experience and affliction... But we can't because the characters are rather plain and cardboard. The whole movie lacks some depth.

The only thing I liked were the last 15 minutes of the picture. They were what the whole film should have been. But somehow makers of the movie couldn't manage to keep all 90 minutes alike. I can't even call these last 15 minutes a climax 'cos there practically were no peripetia at all.

""Primo amore"" is not a horror film certainly as someone states on the cover. I'd say it's one of those ""films of unease"" just like ""The Embalmer"" by the way both being about perverted and obsessive love. ""Primo amore"" is without a doubt moody. Maybe you'll like it if you like this kind of flicks where atmosphere is what matters the most.

I still think Matteo Garrone has a potential as a director and I'm sure he'll surprise us with some intelligent and intellectual thriller one day, but not this time.",1146096000,5,2595,4.694505494505495
