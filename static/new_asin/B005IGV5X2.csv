8474715,5,B005IGV5X2,"I enjoyed seeing Tortuguero and the cloud forest again along with the animals, birds, fish, butterflies, and flowers. I have not been to Corcovado so that was a major benefit. For those who have visited Costa Rica this is a great visual trip back in time. For those thinking about going, you are in for a real treat. History of the region, interviews with American settlers and Costa Rican top leaders, and the terrain from the air will enthrall you.

Bang does not try to cover the entire country but the highlights he picks are an excellent cross-section. This is the best travel video on Costa Rica I have ever seen. It is very realistic including the drenching rain and the wildlife right out in the open.",1339286400,2,709,4.582677165354331
