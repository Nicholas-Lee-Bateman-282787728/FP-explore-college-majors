8272354,5,B00197PP12,"My 3 year old son is obsessed with The Bear Snores On series.  He loves this video.  The DVD actually has 6 stories on DVD, but only 2 of them are from The Bear Snores On series (you get Bear Snores On and Bear Wants More).  The other 4 are actually older animations from the 1980s, which I think are pretty cool and ""old school.""  Not everything has to be a touch screen, you know?  But we basically only watch the first 2 Karma Wilson books, since my son is obsessed.  I like that it is narrated by the actual author of the book as it was interesting to hear it read ""as intended"" by the author.  She does vary her voice a bit for the various characters so that is pretty cute.  The art work is beautiful.  Note, this is not ""traditional"" animation.  It is slower paced but very effective.  The DVD gives you the option of turning the ""captioning"" on or off, so you can read the words on the screen along with the book (or elect not to read the words).  I wish they made a DVD for all of her other Bear stories... big fan over at my house.",1517270400,,1041,4.073891625615763
8272355,5,B00197PP12,"This is a great book!  It not only is enjoyable to read or listen to, it also teaches upper level vocabulary and introduces hibernation.  I highly recommend it for toddlers and early elementary aged students.",1421020800,,208,4.914285714285715

8272357,2,B00197PP12,"The narrator is the author, but she doesn't do a very good job reading it.  The animation is minimal and poor.  The other titles are odd, especially the Bear and the Fly.  Bear and Fly contains martini glasses and a bear opening a wine bottle.",1412640000,,243,4.355555555555555
8272358,4,B00197PP12,Cute short group of bear type stories. The Bear character has 2 stories our son loved.,1411948800,,86,4.4375
8272359,5,B00197PP12,I love the magic of these little shows that bring the stories to life. I love how not only do they stretch the excitement from favorite books but we've also bought books because they loved the animation so much.  This one is a very cute series of animated books.,1388275200,,262,4.346938775510204

i will tell all my friends to look for a copy.",1366848000,,130,4.416666666666667
8272361,5,B00197PP12,"All six stories on this fine DVD feature storybook bears, including Karma Wilson's ""Bear"" as narrated by the author. Another highlight is ""Goldilocks & The Three Bears"" as written & illustrated by the celebrated James Marshall. Weston Woods, New Video & Scholastic all did a great job, with clear, clean audio & video.",1362009600,4,318,5.018867924528302
