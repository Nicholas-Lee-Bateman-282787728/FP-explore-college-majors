8134985,4,B000GX6LLS,"Very good at explaining holes into limit.  However, you need to understand a basic style of play before you can start to really apply this.  It is definitly worth the price of the dvd if you take limit very serious.  Highly recommend for limit players.",1350950400,,252,4.555555555555555
8134986,3,B000GX6LLS,"The production was extremely basic as well as the way it was put together was horrible.  There is a very good amount of information in this 4 set.  I especially like the advanced play dvd.  Very interesting stuff in here.  However, it was put together fairly poorly.  In general, I would buy this dvd set if it were about $25-30 dollars to be honest.  I don't play limit hold'em that much and normally stick to NLHE.  However, I want to start getting into limit tournaments and see where I can go from there.  In that aspect, this would definitly be a good choice for a DVD.  I recommend this if you have played limit/No-limit for quite some time.  Beginners should get informed more before purchasing this item.",1350345600,,712,4.535433070866142
8134987,4,B000GX6LLS,"The production quality sucks but the information is good. I might be partial to the guy simply because he co-authored with Sklansky, but I was definitely not disappointed. This is good for people like me who have played a LOT of poker in a short period of time(under a year at this point in time)",1216857600,2,296,4.4
8134988,5,B000GX6LLS,"Ed Miller is to poker what Bill Walsh was to football in the eighties as innovation is his middle name. When I first read Small Stakes Hold' Em two years ago, which was co-written with David Sklansky, it completely altered my view of the game. What was advocated was a more aggressive approach than I had previously imagined. Pretty soon after I opened it, I became better and was no longer what you'd call ""weak-tight,"" which reminds me of something said on one of these discs, Ed remarked, something to the effect of, ""Remember if you fold jacks every time there's a king on the board, then you're the weak-tight player."" Indeed.

These DVDs are part of a two volume hold `em set created by the company, Expert Hold [...]. Rolf Slotboom has the complementary edition which is devoted to no limit cash games. I can honestly say that both are excellent and worth the investment. Their presentation, structure, and comprehensibility are outstanding. Yes, the production values aren't great--Ed's black hair blends in exquisitely with the night background--and the music's really cheesy, but who cares? You buy these things to improve and make money. They're not supposed to be Vin Diesel movies. As for breaking up the sets, I don't recommend it as the DVD's, other than Slotboom's single disc on limit, mesh together perfectly. They tell a story which, for many of us, is one highlighting past incompetence, and there's nothing more you can ask from an instructional video than that.

Finally, I've noticed that it has become fashionable for many players who play limit or no limit alone to dismiss those publications which do not directly concern them. I think this is a major error as studying limit, regardless of whether I play it regularly, helped my no limit game immensely. It made me more sensitive to subtleties and hand values as you internalize why certain moves are necessary in certain situations. It also makes you more sensitive about the mechanics of the action at your own tables.",1153785600,21,1997,4.870588235294117
