2446212,4,B000BYA4M4,"I had purchased the Kamikaze Girls DVD by Viz a couple of years back, and had been extremely disappointed in it since it came with poor picture quality, poor extras and letterboxed.

This Third Windows Films' BR release (mistakenly coded with no region lock) was my cinematic salvation... Too bad all their other releases come coded for UK regions, their catalog is one of the coolest out there. This one comes with crisp image and color to honor the visual style of Tetsuya Nakashima, and lets you enjoy all the grand visuals of the movie (with optional English subtitles). Sound is a little on the low side, but it's pretty good. Extras in the R2 DVD include a 30min. Making Of (that's more a Behind the Scenes look at the cast, than making of the film), Anna Tsuchiya Music VIdeo, about 5min. of workprint footage, short interviews with Nakashima and Kyoko Fukada, the Japanese trailer of the film (plus TWF trailers), and the 10min short film Unicorn Ryuji (Sadao Abe's character).",1427068800,,985,4.760233918128655
2446213,5,B000BYA4M4,"This is my review for the BLU-ray version, as there seems to be many reviews for the standard DVD and not this exact blu ray edition. I already loved the movie so much I wanted to get a blu-ray version for picture quality sake. I wasn't disappointed. The point of this movie is the fashion aesthetic of Momoko's dresses, and I can see even the gorgeous details in her lace, crystal clear. The color does seem to be even more crazy retro technicolor than I remember (and even the actress's/actor's faces appear a bit redder than I remember), but other than that the moments that need to look normal are just fine, and beautifully clear. I highly recommend getting the blu ray version if you are a fan of this movie!!!",1416787200,6,716,4.473282442748092

2446235,5,B000BYA4M4,"(this review is from my DVD review of the movie, I felt the first 2 reviewers here are reviewing it more on the merits of what region a bonus disc is rather than the movie itself, perhaps you may be a first time viewer of this movie?)

A story between two seemingly unlike people on the surface, but more simlilar then either know underneath.

Some people may think the premise has been done before, but truth be told, everything has been done before. In my opinion it hasn't been done quite as well until now. Underneath all the quirkiness and silly moments, you catch a glimpse of what SOME teenage girls are looking for as they grow up...and that is simply someone they can really call a friend.

At first, you would think one girl is weak while another is strong, but they are more appropriately described as apprehensive. The frilly Momoko hides behind her fantasy Rococo/Lolita facade and the vulgar Ichiko her tomboy/grease monkey grimace. But what both girls hide and sometimes try to run away from is finding true friendship in an otherwise empty and uncaring world.

This really is a beautiful and smart movie, it just so happens to be absolutely hilarious. Witness Momoko's distaste for mass produced fashion from Jusco, and the fictitious tale a once mousy Ichigo created to run away from.

Buy it, watch it once for the experience...watch it again and again for it's little nuances, and see if you can pick up on the extra layers.",1334448000,2,1443,4.665354330708661
2446236,4,B000BYA4M4,"Being a big fan of the DVD release (&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kamikaze-Girls/dp/B000BYA4M4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kamikaze Girls</a>&nbsp;), I was excited to see this on Blu-Ray!

Unfortunately, the release is flawed for anyone outside of the UK (or with a region-free/PAL player).

First, the good news: Video quality is very good (the DVD used a non-anamorphic transfer (so on a widescreen TV, black bars on all 4 sides) with ""permanent subtitles"" part of the video and pretty poor video. The Blu-Ray improves these in every way -- video is sharp for the most part (some scenes seem a little soft, but a very big improvement over the DVD. Definitely doesn't appear to be an ""Upscale/Upconvert""). I will note - while it is Anamorphic widescreen, there are STILL black bars on all 4 sides, just much smaller (about 1 inch on each side (left/right/top/bottom), on a 32"" TV) - I don't know why this is.
Subtitles are removable, audio is Japanese only (5.1).

Unfortunately, part of the problem comes with the 2nd disc (extras) - the extras include music videos, trailers, a short film, interviews with director & cast, and a 40-minute making-of clip (all on the 2nd disc) - while Disc 1 (Blu-Ray) is region free, Disc 2 is PAL-only and will not play on all/most players (a PS3, for example). These were NOT all on the US DVD, so this is a disappointment. There are no extras on the Blu-Ray itself.

Additionally, the ""Sideways Mode"" is missing (it was on the US DVD). The US DVD also included a booklet (Kamikaze Girls: Novala Takemoto preview) and a nice insert for the chapter listing.. none of which are on this set.

If you only care about the movie, this is still a great upgrade from the US DVD, just don't expect to be able to access the extras.",1327881600,5,1804,4.9405940594059405
2446237,4,B000BYA4M4,"If the title of my review makes no sense then hop on a jet to Tokyo and go to Daikanyama station, get off and start walking around. It'll all become clear there...or just watch this movie.

The completely bizarre English title ""Kamikaze Girls"" (the Japanese title basically would be translated as Shimotsuma [it's the name of the countryside town the story takes place in] Story which gives you no clue as to the storyline. Neither does ""Kamikaze Girls"" as I envisioned girls bent on actions that were suicidal. The movie has nothing to do with suicide even ironically or figuratively) is basically a chick flick with a twist. It's more about friendship than romance. The male characters are pretty insignificant as either the older adults (the father and grandmother are really the only significant adults) or the young adult gay fashion designer are just filler.

The title aside a quick synopsis is parents divorce. Superficial mom goes off with rich doctor. Small-time entrepreneur and low-level yakuza father takes daughter in love with the Lolita look (basically a fashion sense known in Japan for aping the look of 18th century French nobles--frills and whatnot) to countryside instead of getting his pinkie cut off as a punishment from his yakuza bosses.

There they live with their slightly nuts but harmless grandma and where the cutesy fashion maven girl meets a female Yanki (yakuza in training somewhat and a play on the Yankee as in American gangster style of...oh who are we kidding it's another thing Japanese got twisted. Yanki members look and act nothing like American greaser gangs of the '50s as much as they try) who is part of a bike gang. By ""bike"" we mean the under 50 cc scooter all gussied up.

Hilarity ensues. From the opening killer fast cuts and punk rock-like tune this is one wild ride. Sadly, after the opening the flick tends to lose steam a bit once our protagonists reach the countryside. It's a pretty uneven movie which although fascinating to watch is not consistently enthralling, if you've lived in Japan. For the rest of you, you might find it more watchable from start to finish than I did. I basically got frustrated with many of the subtitles which although captured the nuances on the whole still left a lot out.

The acting is very good as all actors show a comedic touch. The hairstyle of the ""yanki"" who shows up at the pachinko parlor is straight out of Leningrad Cowboys (Google them, if I've lost you there) and just beyond classic. The relationship between the two girls from opposite sides of the track works.

The extras are great. Interviews with both stars Kyoko Fukada and Anna Tsuchiya along with the obligatory ""message to fans"" (that baffles foreign stars when interviewed in Japan) tacked on that I now know also baffles J-stars especially when you catch Tsuchiya laugh at the end of hers with a look on her face like, ""Was that what you wanted to hear?""

The original trailers are thrown in as well as an Anna Tsuchiya clip that rocks a bit.

Plus a tip: When you pop the DVD in, go to ""Sideways Mode"" as it'll help you understand the movie better. In that mode cabbages (don't ask why) pop up every so often at the bottom of the screen. Hit ""enter"" on your remote to get further explanation of the weirdness that is Japan.

All in all, if you can get past the title, worth checking out.",1326672000,,3351,4.695059625212947

2446240,5,B000BYA4M4,"An outrageous tale of two teenage girls in rural Japan who have found themselves through two rather uniform Japanese subcultures: Lolita and Yanki, and what happens when the two collide initially through a load of blatantly bootleg ""Versace"" garments. Cabbages, Pachinko balls, surrealism, headbutts, frilly bloomers, asides to the viewer, and several baby's eye views of a vagina later, both walk away with a stronger idea of who they are.",1288656000,,440,5.3

If you need to see the extras they are on the standard DVD you can rent.",1286150400,3,267,4.096153846153846
2446242,3,B000BYA4M4,"When I was about 10 or 15 minutes into this movie I wasn't sure I was going to make it. It was way too hyper kinetic for me. It were as though you took a bit of Terry Gilliam, added a little Jean Pierre Jeunet and a dash of Guy Ritchie, edited it with an AK47 and over-saturated the colors. I thought ""no way am I making through this entire movie."" I figured I'd be blind and crazy before it was over. Well....things calmed down a bit from there and I was able to settle in some.

Momoko is a girl who feels she should have been born during the 'Rococo' era with all the frilly dresses and such. She meets up with a tough-ish biker babe, Ichigo, and the two somehow hit it off and wander through a series of minor adventures.

This movie has a good heart and the two female leads do a fine job. What is happening here is that you have these two social misfits who each fills some void in the other. They make a goofy pair to be sure and the script is smart enough to not let things get too sappy. Add to that the host of oddball supporting characters (the Unicorn is a real hoot) and things stay very lively.

It's a lot of fun with some genuinely touching moments. All the aspects of production are decent to good including the rather oddball music score. What makes this work are Momoko and Ichigo. They make for a good pair and you find yourself rooting for them in their own personal quests. I gave this 3 stars but it's really 3 1/2. I could have done without some of the hysteria and, as I watched it subtitled, some of the original Japanese voices can be more than a bit shrill. Listening to them is not unlike having a darning needle shoved through your ears.

All in all this is a good ride. Maybe not for everyone, but if your into new cinematic experiences, you might want to give this a shot.",1281312000,,1804,4.160458452722063
2446243,1,B000BYA4M4,"This review is not about the actual movie which is phantasmagorically awesome. Instead I'm drawing attention to the awful DVD published by Viz Media. The box states ""16x9 Anamorphic Widescreen"" (meaning it should fill your entire screen whether you have an old 4x3 or a new 16x9 widescreen), but this is not the case.

Instead it is ""letterboxed (non-anamorphic)"" widescreen (meaning it's a 16x9 image shrunken down to a 4x3 frame). On a widescreen tv or computer it has a thick black border around all edges. This is compounded with the fact that the digital transfer was not so great to begin with, and the result is a DVD of lousy quality with respect to the standards of 2006 when it was released, not to mention the quality of today. If you try to zoom in to make it fill your screen it looks quite bad. Oh yes, and the English subtitles are hard coded (you can't turn them off) as well as full of errors. This product was apparently thrown together without much thought, and the false advertising is unacceptable.

With other DVD media companies, if you send them a polite email informing them of the error, they will apologize and exchange it for a reissued product or even send you a full refund since retail stores don't do refunds once a DVD is opened. This has happened a few times, and companies like Sony, MGM, etc are eager to keep their customers happy. But with Viz media (whom you can contact via their website listed on the back of the DVD) answered my email with a very curt, snooty response essentially telling me what to do with myself.

Non-anamorphic + false advertising + apathetic customer service = 0 stars. Avoid this product and avoid Viz Media which shouldn't be very hard since they're an obscure Asian company that sells mostly comic books.

I've been told that there is a UK (Region 2) version of this film which is true anamorphic widescreen, released by Third Window Films in Feb 2010. Buy this version and get a region free player (or hack your old player so it can play all regions), and you'll have a great time watching this excellent film which MUST be viewed in its full widescreen enhanced glory.

P.S. If you've already been suckered like me, try emailing Viz. If enough of us speak up, maybe they'll fix the problem like reputable media companies do. I won't hold my breath, though.",1278288000,9,2325,4.606280193236715
2446244,4,B000BYA4M4,"I love this movie to bits and pieces, the only thing that is wrong is that on the subtitle ever so often there is a first letter missing to a word, but it is noticeable, and you will understand immediately what it means.

2446245,2,B000BYA4M4,"The box lists this DVD as Anamorphic Widescreen which this movie IS NOT! Anyone with a widescreen TV will not be happy campers. I ordered this DVD a week ago and the website stated Anamorphic widescreen. I never order DVD's unless they are anamorphic or Enhanced for 16/9 TV (You shouldn't either). Today the DVD is no longer listed on this website as anamorphic, the error has been corrected on the website (not product). It is now listed 1.33:1. Partly correct. It is 4/3 letterboxed widescreen which means black bars top,bottom,right and left. If you have an older DVD player (not HDMI) you may be able to zoom it. If you have a new DVD player, blu-ray or HDMI DVD, too bad.

The movie was excellent, imaginative, and magical. Nothing like I expected. It gets a 4 1/2 rating. The musically score really adds to the movie.",1267056000,,824,4.605442176870748
2446246,5,B000BYA4M4,"There's a surreal, playful quality mixed with a dark undercurrent in this story of two girls who want to be themselves, run their own lives, dress and work (or not) their own ways.

In this case, Momoko is the ultra-girly Lolita girl in her laces and ribbons, parasols, and platform shoes. Ichigo/Ichiko is the biker girl in her student's uniform and ninja boots. Momoko is concerned about being brave enough to grasp happiness, even if happiness is defined by her idea of Rococoo--eating sweet things, dressing loligoth,  being pretty, and working as little as possible. Ichigo wants to work on bikes and have the happiness of true, egalitarian biker friendships. Neither girl likes being told what to do.

There are obstacles for both--Momoko's hapless father and his sales schemes that backfire, her mother who went off to find her own happiness (with Momoko's oddly mature childhood blessing), and being stuck in a non-stylish rural place where frugality is valued more than high-end beribboned fashion.  For Ichigo, it's her bad temper, ignorance, and the change in her gang that turns it from a small sisterhood to a bigger authoritarian clan.

But each girl has her strengths, which become evident as the films goes on.

By becoming entwined--first via an ad placed by Momoko to sell her father's banned Versace knock-offs in order to get cash for her loli clothes, an ad that draws in Ichigo, who needs stylish wear for a wedding--and by developing a contentious but deepening relationship, these two very different girls find that at core, they have fundamental traits in common: they want to be themselves, and they are both courageous in their own ways. They start out rather horrified by each other--it's hilarious to see Momoko's reaction on first meeting Ichiko/Ichigo, along with her habit of spitting and head-butting.

There's excellent direction, cinematography, acting, and some amusing animation. Stories within stories. The Lolita store, Baby, The Stars Shine Bright has its own role here. Lovely unlikely scenes where Momoko takes flight. It has humor, too, and this film is delightful, particularly since the two main roles are so well-cast. Momoko really is doll-like visually, while having a tough streak inside. Ichiko is really tough outside (a transformation for the lovely Tsuchiya, for any who've seen her fashion shots or videos), but has a gooey, romantic core.

I've seen this film twice,and I would happily watch it several more times. Well-told, engaging, playful, a bit gritty, and just plain fun.

Why these girls are called ""Kamikaze"" is beyond me, unless it refers to that spirit of ""I'm alone in this journey, and I'm giving it my all, even if it kills me."" I'm really stretcihng the metaphor, but that's all I could figure. They're young and single-minded and individualistic, and a bit sad and lonely, and they're strong. I guess that's a kamikaze sort of spirit. Probably just some doofus picked a catchy word from the Japanese lexicon, though. Heh.

Recommended if you like movies that are quirky with individualistic female protags.

2446251,4,B000BYA4M4,"""Kamikaze Girls"" is wildly inventive.  Japanese pop star Kyoko Fukada plays Momoko, a girl whose heart and style are attached to the Rococo period in France where dresses bloomed frills & flowers, beautiful and ornate.  The visual look of this film is a key element.  Stylistically, ABC's TV series ""Pushing Daisies"" is kin with its larger than life settings.  Fukada does a great job with wide-eyed innocence.  Ichigo is played by Anna Tsuchiya as a motorcycle girl whose hard edges and constant spitting are the polar opposites of Momoko.  Tetsuya Nakashima does a good job directing this wildly improbably but thoroughly entertaining piece.

Many of the supporting cast are also excellent.

Kirin Kiki who has been in over 60 films plays Momoko's grandmother who seems a bit touched in the head, but who can pull a dragonfly out of the air.  Ryoko Shinohara plays Momoko's mother who abandoned the family to pursue her dream of happiness.  Yoshinori Okada's cameo as the owner of the Baby, the Stars Shine Bright clothing store is somewhere between Elvis Presley and Liberace in style.

2446252,4,B000BYA4M4,"This kinetically paced movie is pure feminine fun.  It's about following your own path in life as we follow the budding friendship between two very different teenage girls in a suburb ~60 miles outside of Toyko.  Not being too hip to the Japanese youth culture, I loved that this disc has a ""sideways"" version of the movie.  What is that you ask?  It's the movie with cabbages appearing on the bottom of the screen periodically and if you press the ""enter"" button whenever you see one, you get a quick footnote on what is going on in the movie for those of us who need it.  These extra little tidbits were great for providing insight into this very different culture.

The characters were quirky and fascinating.  I loved ""little peach"", an emotionally detached girl whose true devotion is saved for the Rococo period.  She dresses in the Lolita fashion to reflect this love.  She was an outcast in school and liked it that way.  Into her life careens ""little strawberry"", who changes her name to befit her position in a girls' biker gang (we're talking mopeds here).  She owes her loyalty to the gang's leader who saved her old timid self and made her who she is today.  A girl that bangs heads with anybody who gets in her way or annoys her.  It is a delight to watch the deepening bond of sisterhood forming between this intriguing duo.

True, this movie is part fantasy, part comic book and chick-lit but it all adds up to an amazing movie that just zips by way too fast.  I understand it was based on a popular series of books.  I'm keeping my fingers crossed for an American version (don't we copy all of their best?) but I'm not sure it would translate well.",1200787200,7,1665,4.48172757475083

2446263,5,B000BYA4M4,"While some critics deem Tetsuya Nakashima's work a Tarantino imitation, I think you can easily dismiss those accusations. Here's why: A.) although the film uses animation (which critics tie to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00068ULLY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>) it is a faster-paced, more distorted use of animation B.) although the film is postmodern (and Tarantino is a postmodern genius), plenty of other films are equally as postmodern (if not more so!) (such as Fincher's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fight-Club/dp/B00003W8NM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fight Club</a>,  Lynch's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mulholland-Drive/dp/B00005JKJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mulholland Drive</a>&nbsp;and even Scott's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-Runner/dp/B000UD0ESA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade Runner</a>) C.) although this film uses ""kitsch"" (which is Tarantino's hallmark) it is a ""kitsch"" all its own. Most importantly, while Tarantino finds connection through violence (which definitely works for him), Tetsuya Nakashima finds connection through devotion/friendship. Pure and simple.  So, do not allow the film's detractors keep you from buying this work.

And, while some Western viewers may be concerned that they will not understand the humor (a valid concern), most of the film transcends cultural boundaries ... it is, a film for young women about friendship (a universal concept). (And, outside of Momoko's Father and Ryuji 'the Unicorn,' there are virtually no men involved).

Still, here are some details you might like to know:

1.) ""Baby, The Stars Shine Bright""(aka ""Baby"" aka ""BTSSB"") is a real boutique which features Lolita couture. In fact, one just opened in Paris (and there is talk of a BTSSB opening in San Fransisco).

2.) The Sweet Lolita clothing that Momoko wears in"" Kamikaze Girls"" is comparable to the prices of traditional designer dresses. This trend (begun in the 1970's) is one geared to those with disposable incomes.

3.) Ichiko's real name ""Ichigo"" means ""strawberry"" in some translations (which is why Ichiko insists on being called anything but ""strawberry""). But ""Ichigo"" can also mean ""one word.""

4.) Kyko Fukada  (Momoko Ryugasaki) and Anna Tsuchiya  (Ichigo Shirayuri) are J-pop stars. And while in American we think of the train-wrecks created by music-stars-turned-actors (like Brittney Spears, Mandy Moore, and Mariah Carrey), the acting here is brilliant. So again, dispel those fears!

This is a super-slick, meticulously crafted, postmodern film. Lush on color and technique. If you enjoy beautiful cinematography, if you wish Ridley Scott's ""Thelma and Louise"" did not end in a fireball, if you wish there were more films about headbutting and embroidery ... well, then this film was made for you!

Click those cabbages!!

Like a huge doll.  Ichigo is a rebellious biker chick who wants nothing but the freedom to do whatever she wants.  Even if she wants nothing!
The story is how these two characters interact and support each other.  Interestingly enough, in some ways they are the same, as both do things their way and refuse to be judged or molded by outside forces.  The movie isn't that long but that's just because it moves so fast, like a biker gang on a major highway, refusing to slow down.
The extras include interviews with both Kyoko Fukada and Anna Tsuchiyo, as well as an Anna Tsuchiyo music clip.  A must for anybody who loves Japanese films, comedy films or weird films.",1186185600,3,832,4.550335570469799
2446265,5,B000BYA4M4,"If Tom Tykwer and  Jean-Pierre Jeunet dropped acid in Tokyo, the resulting movie might be something like ""Kamikaze Girls.""

At heart, this movie is just a story about an unlikely friendship between two unusual, lonely young girls. But it's also wrapped up in quirky characters, astoundingly stylized cinematography, and dabbed with magical realism and bright colour -- in other words, a made-to-order cult flick.

It opens with a shot of Momoko (Kyko Fukada) being hit by a cabbage truck, and flung into the air from her moped. She bids farewell to all the things in her life... and decides to rewind so people can see a bit more of it.

The product of a short-lived shotgun marriage, Momoko is an oddity in her rural Japanese village -- she's enamoured of Rococo-era France, and dresses only in ""Lolita"" clothes. To fund her shopping sprees, she decides to use Ver*ace and Uni*ersal knockoffs her dad used to sell, and immediately gets a customer -- a ""yanki"" biker named Ichiko (Anna Tsuchiya), who's as punky and raw as Momoko is distant.

The girls soon form an odd friendship, based on embroider, pachinko, and Ichiko's short-lived first love. But their paths lead them in new directions -- Momoko is hired to embroider a new model of dress, and Ichiko finds herself dissatisfied with the new gang organizations. And when she decides to leave her gang, Momoko has no choice but to come to her aid.

When you strip it down to the bone, ""Kamikaze Girls"" is just a story about two odd girls -- one a ""girl anachronism,"" one a punk biker -- who become friends, and how they come of age and gain their independence in their own unique ways. No more, no less.

Except it's also wrapped in Tetsuya Nakashima's colourful, magical style -- blooming embroidery, flying girls, cartoon interludes about legendary thugs, and rapid-paced camerawork. One particularly funny scene features  various villagers posing and reciting prices of a Wal-Martish store's cheap clothing, as if they were in a TV commercial. ""The people here are... completely TWISTED,"" Momoko ponders.

The flashbacks to Momoko's birth and childhood are particularly hilarious, especially since they're so exaggerated. And the dialogue is just funny enough without being obviously so (""It was like salivation!"" ""Did she mean 'salvation'?""). But Nakashima does insert some understatedly poignant scenes, such as when Ichiko cries on a hillside with Momoko watching her.

Kyko Fukada does a nice job as the Momoko, who can be haughty one minute and a raging dynamo the next -- depending on whether you dirtied her frilly dress or not. And Anna Tsuchiya is absolutely perfect as the lanky, sometimes violent girl with a sensitive heart underneath. The scene where she attacks a man, shouting, ""You speak, she falls. Got a breath problem?"" is priceless.

""Kamikaze Girls"" is a delightful, hilarious little cult comedy, full of delightful little twists and hilarious dialogue. If only Tetsuya Nakashima would produce a few more of these.",1185062400,2,2993,5.014112903225806

2446268,4,B000BYA4M4,"Although I like the Japanese title much better than the US marketed title, I'll have to live with this version I purchased. [Who is responsible for giving out these US released titles?] ""Kamikaze Girls,"" is a story about a young student named Momoko (Kyoko Fukada) who is fascinated with the 18th century. Both in fashion and beliefs. She is content to live in her own world without friends who share her interest: that is until one day when she meets a female biker named Ichigo (Anna Tsuchiya). Momoko [""Peach"" in Japanese] meets Ichigo [""Strawberry"" in Japanese], while she is trying to sell her clothes on the internet.

They meet due to the fact that one day Momoko decides of a way to make extra money, by selling her designer clothes on the internet. However, only one customer shows up: Ichigo. Ichigo shows up in her pink motor-scooter. And the film turns into one charming film. My reason for initially buying this film was that my eldest daughter saw it in our local video store, and asked for it. For those who like action films, this is not one of those type of films. This is a good dramatic film. Plus the color and visuals in the film are very good.

This is a very charming film about the friendship which develops between these two young teenagers, and they both give a fresh and delightful performance in their respective roles. Moreover, you really enjoy watching the acting that these two remarkably different characters bring to the film. And director Tetsuya Nakashima did a very good job with character development in this particular film. It is definitely a family film that your children can watch too.

My eldest daughter is 13, the youngest is 11. My eldest daughter enjoyed the film tremendously. There is no violence or nudity in the film, so you don't have to worry about a Takashi Miike type of film. All in all, I enjoyed the film, as it was a pleasant and entertaining watch. Many veiwers here have described the film in length, however, it is well worth the watch. The DVD transfer is one that could be improved on, but it is still an enjoyable film, and a worthwhile purchase. Recommeneded: Rent it first.",1172361600,,2141,4.658730158730159
2446269,5,B000BYA4M4,"This is one of the quirkiest movies you are likely to see and it would have been truly easy to make something truly awful that closely resembled this, but thankfully director/writer Tetsuya Nakashima managed to craft something truly special instead.  I believe that this film will become something of a cult classic, a destiny it will truly deserve.

The film is essentially a buddy film nestled in the culture mismatch between traditional Japanese values and Japan's ongoing weird appropriation of Western material culture.  The main character, for instance, Momoko, yearns to be a creature of the European rococo period, dresses in Lolita clothing (a real brand that makes little girl clothes for adult females called Baby, the Stars Shine Bright), all the way to practicing embroidery, which she imagines the quintessential rococo pursuit for young women.  Her father gets into trouble selling fake brands of Western goods, only getting into trouble when he combines more than one brand on a T-shirt.  At the heart of the film is Momoko's unlikely friendship with Ichigo, a rebellious young girl who is a member of a motorcycle (well, motor scooter) gang.  Dressing tough, constantly spitting, and head butting Momoko when she disagrees with her, the rough hewn Ichigo and the dainty Momoko make one of the most unlikely pair of friends ever seen on screen.  The delight comes from seeing how the delicate, subdued Momoko possesses a toughness that belies her physical appearance, while the tough, mean Ichigo has a tender, vulnerable side.  The two make a wonderful team.

The film's finest qualities are impossible to describe in words.  It has from beginning to end a wonderful visual style, combining both a forceful dynamism with an almost aggressive use of colors.  As I watched the film I kept thinking of the art design in the original BABE film or AMELIE.  The colors are lush and brilliant, almost giving the film the look of a fantasy film.  The pace of the film is frequently frenetic, quickly moving from one image or bit of narrative to another.  Yet the film never becomes incoherent or unbalanced.  And throughout Nakashima manages a delightful comic tone.

Kyko Fukada as Momoko and Anna Tsuchiya as Ichigo are wonderful in the lead roles.  The interviews with the two of them are very interesting.  Many of the supporting players are memorable as well, but the two leads carry the film.

My one fear with this film is that it will only be watched by fans of anime and other Japanese pop phenomena.  This truly is a delightful film and I think anyone who enjoys whimsy in his or her films should give it a viewing.",1170460800,3,2634,4.88963963963964
2446270,5,B000BYA4M4,"This immediately became my favorite movie.  The story mixes humor, off beat characters, sweet music, and a very unlikely bonding of two girls who seem totally opposite.  Momoko, who dresses Lolita, finds no reason to develop close personal relationships and is content to live in her Rococco dreamworld.  Ichigo, who as a schoolgirl was ridiculed and picked on, has became tough and angry.  As the movie progresses, each of them come to respect themselves and each other.  The flick is in japanese and subtitled, so I had to watch it a few times to capture every scene.  Sideways mode lets you click the enter button and get additional information about various topics.  Special features includes a Anna Tsuchiya video.  A MUST SEE!",1169769600,8,732,4.942622950819672
2446271,4,B000BYA4M4,"""Kamakazi Girls"" (""Shimotsuma Monogatari"") is a lot like the fashion portrayed in the movie: flashy and colorful, but without much deeper meaning.  It is purely an Idol vehicle, promoting two trendy J-Pop talents Kyoko Fukada and Anna Tsuchiya and directed by Tetsuya Nakashima, whose main experience as a director is producing slick pop-promos for similar J-Pop hopefuls.

Which doesn't make it bad.  Sometimes flashy and colorful is lots of fun, and not every film needs to be serious.  Nakashima pulls lots of tricks out of his hat, and creates a bubblegum world where no one has sex or gets into any real danger, but everyone gets all the thrills and drama that are the dreams of poor girls stuck out in farm country.  The jump-cuts are tight and unbalancing, and he even pulls in a few animated sequences ""Kill Bill""-style just to remind you that what you are really watching is a live-action cartoon.

The story is classic star-crossed lovers.  Momoko (""Peach"" in Japanese) is a follower of the ""Lolita fashion"" (specifically ""sweet lolita"") popular with girls in the Harajuku area of Tokyo.  She loathes her circumstances, the only fashion-conscious girl in a town where everyone buys their clothes at Jusco, the Japanese equivalent of Wal-mart.  However, lolita fashions are extraordinarily expensive, and as a way to support her mania she decides to sell off her father's fake Versace clothes that he used to deal.  Enter Ichigo (""Strawberry"" in Japanese), the polar opposite of Momoko, a follower of the Yankee fashion, meaning driving flashy scooters and wearing long coats, basically playing the role of fashionable young delinquents. Because it is a movie, these two become a quick pair, loathing each other and loving each other at the same time.  Hijinks ensue.  Hearts are broken. True love conquers all.",1165363200,,1820,5.070469798657718

This movie is definitely for those that can truly appreciate the pure essence and beauty of female friendship.  There is a scene near the end when the uppity, seemingly prudish Momoko staunchly defends and protects her rough-around-the-edges biker friend, Ichigo that made us want to cheer.

The movie is ""letterboxed"", not ""animorphic/enhanced"" so it won't display properly on a widescreen TV/Monitor.

On a regular TV it looks fine but on a widescreen display you get a centerd image with the black bars on the top and bottom, rather than it ""filling* the screen.

This is just lazyness on the part of Viz since it would have cost them the same to have it produced either way.

2446286,5,B000BYA4M4,"One of the few delightful movies I've seen in recent years is this quirky adaptation of Novala Takemoto's novel.  Dreamer Momoko Ryugasaki feels stranded in Shimotsuma in Ibaraki Prefecture, north of Tokyo, i.e. the boonies.  She feels more at home in France's opulent Rococo period (1715-1770), cutting quite a figure dressed in her pink Lolita dress, white parasol, and white platforms.  She is the main character and narrator, occasionally speaking to the camera.

Momoko lives with her loser father and grandmother in a shabby hut, a far cry from her birthplace, the bustling bargain hunters' paradise of Amagasaki in Hyogo Prefecture--a suburb of Osaka on the northeast shore of Osaka Bay.  She has an individualistic approach to life, at one point not hesitating to tell made up stories of a classmate in trouble to get money to buy her expensive Lolita clothes, leading her father to bawl in sympathy and fork over the cash.  ""So what if I was deceitful?  My happiness was at stake.  It's not wrong to feel good.  But actually my soul is rotten.""  A retread of that 60's mentality of if it makes you happy, do it.

Enter Ichiko Shiyayuri, a tough-looking, rough-talking, sometimes hot-tempered member of the ladies biker gang The Ponytails who occasionally spits, to the disgust of the more refined Momoko.  She is astounded and appreciated at being able to buy a bogus Versace jacket for only 2000 yen ($20), and there starts the beginning of the one of the most unlikely friendships ever.  Ichiko's more down-to-earth and more connected to people than Momoko and when the latter makes a comment that really pi**es her off, headbutts her.

Ichiko wants to find a legendary embroiderer named Emma in Tokyo's Daikanyama area.  Turns out that Akimi, the fierce but elegant leader of the Ponytails is retiring and Ichiko wants to show her gratitude by having some special stitching done on her long kamikaze coat.  However, they need money and poor Momoko is hijacked by Ichiko to a pachinko parlour.

Scenes not in the book:  some surreal humour when Momoko buys a cabbage then hands it to Ichiko.  ""This is your new friend.""  Another is a low-ranking yakuza named Ryuji whose hairdo has to be seen to be believed--hint, his nickname is Unicorn Ryuji.  The dual branding scene of tying in Universal Studios and Versace has a humorous side, when to mock the copyright violation done by Momoko's dad on his counterfeit goods, the words ""Versace"" and ""Universal"" are bleeped to make them ""Ver*ch"" and ""Uni*sal Studios.""  Also satirized are people who feel proud to save money at Jusco--Japan's Walmart, and pose like in brochures, cheesy smile and all--""this polo shirt cost me only 800 yen.""  ""These people are twisted,"" says a disgusted Momoko with a sour expression on her face.

Shimotsuma Monogatari benefits from the dynamic performances of Kyoko Fukada as Momoko and half Japanese/half Russian Anna Tsuchiya as Ichigo.  Fukada's very fetching in the supercute Lolita costumes, which do a nice job of contrasting her tanned complexion and milk-tea coloured hair.  Her expressions are delightful from her cute babyishness to when her eyes widen.  Tsuchiya herself has some comic moments, when she clowns around in the Aristocratic Forest caf&eacute; trying to attract Fukada's attention.  But there is a poignant moment when she gets heartbroken, showing her to be more human than Momoko.  Tsuchiya is definitely the better actress, having won more awards for this film than Fukada.

Included in the eclectic soundtrack are the Petula Clark-ish ""Lucie Est Amoreuse,"" the melancholy Lisa Loeb-ish ""She Said,"" the slamming power pop of ""Time Machine wa Onegai,"" and Yoko Kanno's score, ranging from sweet violin, ragtime piano, and French caf&eacute; accordion melodies.

One other theme is finding one's niche.  Momoko feels at home wearing her Lolita clothes and is great at embroidery.  Ichiko's happy fixing bikes at a mechanic's shop in Tsuchiura, but doesn't want people telling her what to do.  Also, choose your own style over the cheap and casual--Daikanyama's Baby The Stars Shine Bright boutique over Jusco.

Watching Shimotsuma Monogatari inspired me to visit the Ushiku Buddha and Shimotsuma itself during my Japan trip.  The interior of the Shimotsuma station has been altered from the original, no big screen TV, but the platform where Momoko is seen waiting for her train is accurate.

Shimotsuma Monogatari is a funny off-the-wall cult comedy that will be appreciated by Japanophiles, particularly those interested in the youth and fashion scene.  One complaint:  why Kamikaze Girls?  What's wrong with the original title?

2446287,5,B000BYA4M4,"A story between two seemingly unlike people on the surface, but more simlilar then either know underneath.

Some people may think the premise has been done before, but truth be told, everything has been done before.  In my opinion it hasn't been done quite as well until now.  Underneath all the quirkiness and silly moments, you catch a glimpse of what SOME teenage girls are looking for as they grow up...and that is simply someone they can really call a friend.

At first, you would think one girl is weak while another is strong, but they are more appropriately described as apprehensive.  The frilly Momoko hides behind her fantasy Rococo/Lolita facade and the vulgar Ichiko her tomboy/grease monkey grimace.  But what both girls hide and sometimes try to run away from is finding true friendship in an otherwise empty and uncaring world.

This really is a beautiful and smart movie, it just so happens to be absolutely hilarious.  Witness Momoko's distaste for mass produced fashion from Jusco, and the fictitious tale a once mousy Ichigo created to run away from.

Buy it, watch it once for the experience...watch it again and again for it's little nuances, and see if you can pick up on the extra layers.",1148169600,10,1212,4.816425120772947

2446303,5,B000BYA4M4,"I first heard about Kamikaze Girls on a Japanese Rock Yahoo group.  Tommy Heavenly16's music is a major part of the feel on the film. Why the opening theme was left off the Japanese soundtrack CD I can't imagine. Perhaps they felt it was too derivative of the Go-Gos' 'Head Over Heels'.  But there's much more to the movie than just the great music.

I first saw it as a fansub, which would only play on the VCL Media Player.  A quriky clunky player where you have to open the subtitles seperately.  I couldn't figure it out right away, so the first time I watched it I opened them in a seperate window and scrolled them down as the movie progressed.  A truely terrible way to watch a movie.  But this movie was so good it didn't matter.

It has a real anime broght to life feel, unlike live action Sailor Moon, which seemed more like a reagular Japanese television show with cheesy effects so bad it was funny.  Kamikazi Girls is just plain funny!  But it's also very touching.  And the animated scenes are great.  The fansub did have one line better then the DVD.  At the very beginning when the animated gang leader says, ""My Bike Ignites!"" was translated as, ""My Machine Spits Fire!"" in the fansub -- A far more colorful and dramatic way of reading that line.  But don't let that stop you from buy this DVD.  Just think ""My Machine Spits Fire!"" at the begininning when it comes up and enjoy the rest of the movie -- the rest of the translation in it is fine.

I had to wait 6 months for the Viz official release, but it was well worth the wait.  I had a Suncoast gift card, but when they said they'd have to order it, I just jumped on Amazon and did it myself.  It is the best movie of 2005!!!  Do yourself a favor and order it today!!!!!",1140393600,9,1742,4.2560975609756095
2446304,4,B000BYA4M4,I really enjoyed this movie!  I love all the lolita outfits!  Momoko looked so beautiful!  Would have given it a 5 but I really didn't like Ichigo.  Felt like she was trying to hard (meaning her acting).  Other wise it was a really entertaining film.,1140220800,5,250,4.466666666666667
2446305,4,B000BYA4M4,"I really enjoyed this movie.  The visuals are very appealing with bright colors and unusual costumes.  The characters are fantastic and I found myself laughing out loud several times.

I actually wasn't expecting much from this movie but purchased it anyway because the concept of this ""lolita"" girl in Japan made me very curious.  I'm glad I did watch Kamikaze Girls because it is one of the few good live action Japanese movies I've seen in a while.

Now, I'm giving this DVD 4 stars not because of the movie (which earns 5), but because of the DVD quality itself. Anamorphic widescreen is listed on the back of the DVD case but the DVD is NOT anamorphic, it is formatted in 16X9 widescreen.

I haven't tested the subtitles but from what I have read in a previous review they are non-removable. Big mistake.

Anyway, excellent movie and most people will never notice the two flaws listed above anyway. Highly recommended.",1140220800,8,923,4.73125
2446306,4,B000BYA4M4,"Imagine GHOST WORLD with WILD ZERO's energy level and you got KAMIKAZE GIRLS.  For the first 30 minutes I totally loved this film with its rocket ship pace, bright colors, crazy imagery and the hot Fyoko Fukada in her Lolita dresses (mmmm), but then gradually the pace slowed down, the shots got longer and the story kicked the bucket.

So sad.  I hate it when a film starts out great then runs low on gas and coasts to a slow, gasping death.  Well, maybe it wasn't quite that dramatic of a death, but compare the end to the beginning and you'll see there's a big difference.  Still worth watching thought.",1139788800,3,606,4.472727272727273
2446307,5,B000BYA4M4,"`Kamikaze Girls' is a delightful, pop, unique, and utterly sweet tale of the friendship between two Japanese girls Momoko and Ichigo. Sure, some part of the film's very disarming charms can be appreciated more with knowledge of modern Japanese culture, but that doesn't mean the film should be seen only by the small coterie of moviegoers. After all the film's theme is a universal one.

First, remember the film's original title (and its original novel) is called `Shimotsuma Monogatari' (The story of Shimotsuma) because this actual town that is located in the northern suburb of Tokyo City (about 60 km to the north of the metropolis) is the place where we meet our cute heroines.

OK, this rural town is the place where Momoko (meaning literally `peach-child' in Japanese) is living. She loves wearing pretty, girlish (and expensive) clothing (usually referred to `Lolita' or `Lolita Fashion' in Japan) and in order to buy them she goes all the way to Tokyo. One day, she thinks of a brilliant idea to get money. Following the `business' of her ex-yakuza father, Momoko sells counterfeit designer clothing on the net.

Only one customer shows up. It is Ichigo (literally meaning `strawberry'), a teenage girl clad in a long coat (signature of Japanese teenage motorcycle gangs), and riding a ridiculously decorated pink-colored scooter. Somehow this incongruous pair of girls gets friendlier to each other, and Momoko, confirmed loner, finds there is something precious that she cannot buy, more precious than the fancy dress that she is wearing.

[DELIGHTFUL] The incredibly charming film is not so much about the story as the two incredibly charming characters Momoko (Kyoko Fukada) and Ichigo (Anna Tsuchiya). From the exaggerated cartoon-ish style of introduction, we immediately fell in love with these heroines, whose unique outlook on life and original code of behavior perfectly matches their equally unique and original fashion. Actually, Momoko's costumes are one of the assets of the film, which will be good inspiration for designers.

Unfortunately, some amusing scenes might be lost on non-Japanese viewers, which heavily rely on the linguistic differences between some regions in Japan. Please remember this. Momoko's father is from Kansai area, of which dialect is more down-to-earth and slightly earthy than the words Momoko usually uses with a posh voice, who loves the French rococo fashion. Momoko's always gramatically correct speech makes a great contrast with Ichigo's frequent verbal slip-ups when heard in Japanese. And as to the several funny episodes about selling counterfeit goods, they are very exaggerated, but not totally fictional.

But you don't have to worry about the languages, because the joy of `Kamikaze Girls' means its amusing visuals and portraits of the likable heroines, Momoko and Ichigo. The only thing I disagree with `Kamikaze Girls' is its misleading English title. Why not call it simply like `Momoko and Ichigo' or something? Otherwise it is an absolutely charming film with these cute, lovely, and inimitable heroines.

By the way, contrary to the impression you might have from the role of Ichigo, Anna Tsuchiya started her career as fashion model.",1139529600,43,3206,5.262230919765166
2446308,4,B000BYA4M4,"...it would be like KAMIKAZE GIRLS. Great chemistry between the 2 lead actresses. Great goofy fun, check it out. Some of the subtitling could be more accurate but since it's such a visual film it dosen't harm the movie too much.",1137628800,4,228,4.585365853658536
2446309,4,B000BYA4M4,"I saw this in Tokyo when it was released and loved it.  Got the Japanese DVD here.  Sadly, it is ever so slightly hollow a movie, but where the story isn't as lush and gripping as a classic, the visuals make up for it through acting and filming.

""Kamikaze Girls"" (why oh why couldn't they have called it SHIMOTSUMA STORY?!??) seems like a Japanese manga brought to live action.  It displays and parodies facets of society in Japan, and using humor and design it keeps the viewer engrossed.  The two main actresses and their characters are adorably cute and expressive.  The lead man, the father, is amazing in his own way as an actor and a character caught in the grimy world of the 'cheap fashion' underground.  The anime sections slipped in are maybe the least congruous sections of the film, but provide a splash of visual variety.  It's Japan having a laugh at itself, it's stereotypes from within, and mostly poking fun at the earnest ways of young women.  The greatest let down of the film to me must be the end scenes of the climax- they were shoddily handled as if the entire crew was worn down and out of cash in the final days, but it tells the story and makes its point well enough.

I knew it was amazing when it began with the lead character flying through the air caused by a road accident, dressed in Rococo/Lolita garb not unlike Little Bo Peep, surrounded by cabbages, pachinko balls slipping from her purse to signify her life slipping away, and she mentally bids farewell to the world... then she backs up to contemplate what caused this, everything rewinds super fast and the story begins.  Interesting, crafty, silly, striking, and just pure fun for the family. (No sex or nudity, language seems clean, no serious violence aside from a fight at the end, and some cartoonish head butting)",1133222400,47,1809,4.604361370716511
2446310,5,B000BYA4M4,"Who came up with the title ""Kamikaze Girls,"" anyway?  That makes no sense.  It's like calling the ""Indiana Jones"" films ""Guy with a hotdog and bun.""  There's no sound reason for renaming ""Shimotsuma Monogatari"" aka ""Shimotsuma Town's Story.""  It is in no way related to Japanese nationalism or WWII.  That said, this is one of the most amazing films I have ever seen!

Kyoko Fukada is such a darling, and she plays her character Momoko with a great detachment which really adds to her wonderful day dream fantasies.  When Ichigo, a yanki-gang member becomes best friends with Momoko, a teen sporting the new fashion craze of Lolita style, the pair embark on a journey to seek out a legendary embroiderer who can fix Ichigo's misspelled kanji (chinese characters) on her jacket.  The two go to Tokyo and their unlikely bond grows into a full fledged friendship.  Momoko soon realizes, after spending most of the film avoiding or complaining about Ichigo's company and antics, how vital Ichigo's friendship really is to her.  When Ichigo's gang is miffed at her lack of loyalty to them...well what can I say, girl power all the way!  This film is a laugh a minute!  And the colors are so saturated, making the visuals all have a pink, green, blue, purple, gloss to the various scenes.  The music by Yoko Kano is genius and fits the popular trends and themes of this movie with equally appealing pop beats!

For those who understand Japanese culture, the film is doubly funny with its social commentary and comedic satire.  I highly recommend this to everyone, especially if you're looking for something fun and original!",1132444800,5,1618,4.832727272727273
2446311,5,B000BYA4M4,"This movie is very funny, entertaining and well directed. The soundtrack is excellent and was composed primarily by Yoko Kanno. While it is primarily a comedy it is also a story of friendship between two girls who in some ways are very different but in other ways are very much the same. It is a very colorful film, and of course the lolita clothes are very cute. The rewatchability of this movie is high. I have watched it several times and enjoy it every time! The main characters live in a town called Shimotsuma. The Japanese title of this film is Shimotsuma Monogatari (Shimotsuma Story). I have the HK DVD which is pretty nice, but I will buy this US version too when released. I hope it includes some bonus features. This movie is highly recommended!
