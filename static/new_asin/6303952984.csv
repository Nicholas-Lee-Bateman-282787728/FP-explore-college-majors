750103,5,6303952984,"The people who criticise the film for not having a plot or storyline miss the point of this film.  We watch the Brothers McMullen struggle with morality and love.  It is nice to see a film that deals with love and sex on a deeper level than just love and sex.  Edward Burns has a great ear for dialogue, keeping the dialogue real-sounding and never stilted.  It's too bad that as a filmmaker, he has not reprised the artistic success he had with this film.",987897600,5,456,4.329411764705882
750104,5,6303952984,"In ""The Brothers McMullen,"" the three grown (Irish-American) sons of an alcoholic, hilariously stupid, complete bozo of a father reunite and Do The Bonding Thing.  All three have female-related issues and problems to rival those of, for example, the president of the United States from 1993 to 2001 -- what was his name again?  AAANY-who, they are all forced to live under one roof for a few weeks, and must come to terms with all kinds of things.  This movie is not ""Terms of Endearment,"" however.  It is funny, irreverent, and light-hearted without being fluff.
The generation portrayed in this film is, in a lot of ways, the first generation of Irish Americans in their particular family to be coming to terms with the manifold social issues pertaining to the great American melting pot.  One brother is having huge problems with the stringent demands of the Irish brand of Catholicism, which are uproariously exacerbated by his relationship with a nice young Jewish American Princess, who wants him to move into her house with her extended family, and go to work for her daddy in the garment district.  The second brother seems to be unable to understand how nice it can be, and how worth fighting for, to have a college-educated, intelligent woman (a standout, very cool performance by Connie Britton [probably my favorite performance in the movie]) as a wife.  The third brother (Edward Burns) is sort of the stereotypical Irish ne'er do well writer, who drinks too much, and fears commitment like the Black Death, but who has inexplicably attracted the unwavering love of the flabbergastingly bodacious Maxine Bahns...  Anyway, I myself had an interesting viewpoint on this movie.  Want to hear it?  Well too bad, I'm going to tell you anyway.  Watching this movie, I felt like what might have been a child of Mike McGlone's character and his non-Irish girlfriend from the first part of the movie.  I saw this with my Irish American father and a couple of his brothers...  It's sort of sad in some ways -- they expect me and my siblings to have a visceral understanding of many of the jokes about Catholicism, Irish drinking, etc.  As the first generation in my family to be a good old American mutt, of mixed ethnicity, and having grown up in your standard white bread suburb, (okay, a Boston suburb, so mostly Irish, but still..) there were many things in this movie I couldn't have a personal reaction to.  The movie speaks to the sociological issues of a family at a particular stage in the acculturation process in becoming Americans -- and a very early stage at that.  I don't mean to make too huge a deal out of this, but the fact is that the Mike McGlone character -- by leaps and bounds the most conscientious brother -- is facing some very real problems in this movie, in terms of possibly giving up Catholicism, etc.  Not that becoming neurotic and freaking out about them is such a hot response, but at least he is aware of them.
But moving on -- this is one of those rare films that can be enjoyed by a bunch of guys with their buddies, over a case of Guiness, yet can equally be appreciated by women.  No one would call this a chick flick, but women can enjoy it.  As a matter of fact, because there are no explosions or car cases, or, on the other hand, no weepy emotional scenes, this movie can actually be enjoyed in mixed company, sort of like ""Jerry Maguire"" or ""Beautiful Girls.""  Anyway, I enjoyed this a lot, and I recommend it to anyone.  Two thumbs up.",985046400,3,3483,4.640065146579804
750105,1,6303952984,"So we were waiting on line at the Embarcadero in 1995 and I had reasonably high hopes - the movie seemed to have good 'buzz' as an unassuming slice-of-life comedy, marking a nice change of pace from the usual cinema offerings: Neither a big-budget assault on the senses nor a pretentious subtitled art film. Irish myself, I was intrigued by the movie's Celtic focus as well. All in all, it looked promising... and then the lights dimmed and the film started.
Man, what a disappointment.
To paraphrase Madame Bovary, I *wanted* to love this movie, but it simply gave me no reason to do so. Ostensibly a comedy, it offered no opportunity for laughs. (Can you remember a single punch line from the film? an arresting comic image? an improbable situation laden with wackiness? Me neither.) Ostensibly a romantic comedy, it offered no romance. (Of the three couples, one is dull, one is dim-witted, and one is downright depressing.) Ostensibly character-driven, it didn't have characters. (The roles range from simple-minded sketches to straight-out stereotypes, including a character ""from the garment district"" whose presence in a Spike Lee film would have drawn immediate protests from the ADL.) Ostensibly a film, it offered no plot. (What was the dramatic conflict we were watching unfold again?)
And the acting! Trent Lott would be the lively one in this cast of cadavers. I realize that Burns had budget limitations, but come on - you've got to do better than just having 'that guy from the auto shop' playing Brother #3, and you need to do more than just put a coat on a guy and say he's going to play a literary agent. Hey, my mom's not doing anything this weekend, maybe she can be the female lead!
Again, I realize the film had a low budget, but other directors have done much more with much less - c.f. American Movie's Mark Borchardt - and it doesn't cost *anything* to write a decent script.
Ed Burns has often said he wants to be the Irish equivalent of Woody Allen. Well, his films are missing just a few minor elements - wit, dialogue, characters, plotlines, cinematography, originality, depth, and a beginning, middle and end. Once he takes care of those, he'll be fine.",971913600,10,2183,4.777777777777778
750106,5,6303952984,"Having worked in the entertainment industry for years I have found that the idea of ""story"" has become passe and ""flash and glam"" has replaced the craft of fine moviemaking.  This film has  resored my faith in the art.  I would like to see what the result would be  if we were to give the ""great"" film directors of the modern  cinema a couple thousand bucks to shoot a film.  Chances are they would  fall far short of this first effort by a very talented  writer/director/actor.  Please sit down, enjoy, and laugh yourself to  death.
If you're interested in the filming and scripting of this (and  other) Ed Burns films... check out his book ""Three Screenplays.""  It's well worth the read.  Oh, and if there are any Irish-Americans out  there looking for a film to relate to... this is the one!",947030400,7,794,4.539007092198582

And if no story appears, that's pretty much what I  expected . . . unlike a film, which you hope will (eventually) convey a  story!!!

750189,1,6303952984,"Watched this movie back when it originally came out. Time has hardened me! The story itself is good. The acting, all around, every actor guilty, sucks. Really bad.",1463616000,,163,4.857142857142857
750190,4,6303952984,"Charming, sweet comedy drama about three working class brothers temporarily moving back in together after their hated fathers death -- even though they're now in their late 20s through early 30.  The film has a lot of simple honesty in its explorations of relationship and sex for three once good Catholic boys, now confused about morality  both the churchs and their own -  and their struggle to finally grow up.

Made on a shoestring (reportedly $24,000),  Burns does a solid job in all of his roles as a triple threat; director, writer and actor.  But there are weak spots. Some of the performances are terrific (the young Connie Britton and Burns himself particularly stand out), but the others range from solid but unspectacular, to weak enough to be a little hard to watch.  Theres also a pat-ness to some of the writing of key supporting parts that doesnt live up to the strongest scenes with the lead characters, where Burns blends the honest, complicated comedy and tragedy of day to day life with aplomb.

But if the film doesnt quite live up to the hype that surrounded it at Sundance 20 years ago, it's still is a better and more human film than almost anything Hollywood can manage these days.",1462320000,,1206,4.70952380952381

750373,3,6303952984,"The Brothers McMullen, for all the great press it got when it was released, isn't really a very good film.  It's poorly lit and shot, the script is ham-fisted and cliche'd, and the acting is painfully sub-par.  It was an indie success story but like a lot of them from the general time period, it was more about the story of the making of the film than it ever was about the story of the film itself.  Connie Britton's probably had the strongest post-Brothers career of all the cast, and she's generally been good, but she doesn't shine much brighter than the rest of Burns' players in this tale of Irish cliche's and faux lower-middle-class angst.  It's worthwhile as an historical curiosity, and the director's commentary has some real value for anyone looking to put together their own micro-budget feature, but it's not hard to see why Edward Burns has been stuck making tiny little films in relative obscurity since his sophomore effort (She's The One) more or less crashed and burned.  The Brothers McMullen doesn't fall to the level of truly bad; it's just weak and un-engaging and covers a lot of very familiar ground.",1361318400,,1126,4.724489795918367

750378,5,6303952984,"After a gap of nearly two decades, I serendipitously came across the movie, The Brothers McMullen. I dimmed the lights, sat down with a glass of wine, tube of Pringles and luxuriated in the preparation, for what I guessed would be a nostalgic and schmaltzy experience. What a surprise! This is a wonderful movie!

It is set in pre 9/11 New York, where nothing casts a shadow and anything is possible. Three brothers from an Irish American family are united again as young adults and despite their differences, they capture the essence of what makes blood ties so unbreakable. We expect great things from our siblings, yet when they are less than they can be, when they shatter our illusions, we forgive them and cheer them on. Because what we are essentially doing is forgiving ourselves, shouting out to the little boys and girls that we still are.

Jack, the eldest and most handsome, and let me digress here; When I watched this for the first time in 1995, I enjoyed it immensely, because I was Irish and had lived in Queens, NY. I had big hair and wore baggy shirts, but I didn't think the Brothers were so attractive. Now with the advantage of hindsight and the clarity of age, or maybe just envy at their timeless youth, I was beguiled by their perfect skin, toned physiques and of course their Irish charm (which unbelievably, Irish men in the old country have yet to perfect!). Anyway, getting back to the storyline - Jack is married to Molly, who could also have been called Jane, for her girl next-door loveliness. He is seduced by a temptress from the city and to my horror, poor Moll forgives him.....

Patrick is the youngest brother, a devout Catholic, overwhelmed by his longtime, Jewish girlfriend. Though he has prospects for big business and a moneyed lifestyle if he marries her, he makes a break for it. After much soul-searching and heart to hearts with his bros, he makes peace with his soul and takes a big bite out of life.

Barry (Finbar), the Casanova of the piece is the budding screenwriter, who basically falls for the perfectly pert, gazelle-like leading lady. He could not but succeed, so driven, cock-sure and confident is he. Despite his questionable style (long hair, yellow shirt and white trousers, way after Labor Day), he is breathtaking!

Let me say it again. This is a wonderful movie. If you have ever spent a vacation in the Big Apple and loved it - you should watch this movie. Where Woody Allen's Annie Hall and Manhattan have become dated, this is as fresh as a cup of Chock Full o'Nuts. Buy it and add it to your collection. This is a precious movie, a gem that will only increase in value as we all mature. God Bless Ed Burns!",1314489600,4,2673,4.59538784067086
750379,3,6303952984,"I saw ""The Brother McMullen"" after ""She's The One.""  I liked ""She's The One"" better but see how it is derived from ""The Brothers McMullen"".  This movie doesn't have the star power, but still packs a pretty good punch story wise.

The story to me is a little harder to relate too, it seems to be a little more ""specific"" than ""She's The One,"" and that is a slight turn off to me.  The cinematography isn't as good and the story is a little more bleak than in ""She's The One.""

Over all a good movie.  If you are a fan of Indies or Eddie Burns, you should absolutely see this.  If you are looking for a more modern, main stream, Romantic Comedy, I would recommend ""She's The One"" over ""The Brother McMullen""",1312416000,,705,4.2556390977443606

Also, it presents soem of the same issues as the book ""Limbo,"" namely guys who grow up blue collar but who end up in white collar jobs and how they still have blue collar values and thought processes and dealing with the people now referred to as ""Bobos"" ie: the upper middle and upper class with their code words and informal rules that most of don't have a clue about.

Burns is a poor man's Kevin Smith, in that Smith has no sense of composition either, but Smith's dialogue is much more livelier than Burns's ever will be  (I'm not a huge Smith fan, either).  I really don't understand why people loved this film as much as they did, and why critics acted like it was the Citizen Kane of its era.

Barry's reaction to his mother's fate and also to his own relationship with his father, makes Barry afraid to form a steady relationship with the woman of his dreams.

750453,3,6303952984,"The Brothers McMullen is supposed to be about what it's like having grown up Irish-Catholic in America, which, in the context of this movie, is supposed to be about being sexually repressed.  It's an outstanding movie that everyone should see.
The movie is about the relationship of three brothers to the women in their lives and to each other.  I must warn you, this is a serious romantic comedy-there's no severed limbs, exploding buildings, or sensational car wrecks.  It's a quiet movie with no action.  It's also a movie you can watch more than once and still be equally engrossed.
 The oldest brother is a high school basketball coach, but, oddly, he's very non-jock like.  He's somewhat sensitive and a little thoughtful for crying out loud!  And he doesn't drink enough beer for a coach.  He is friends with another woman who has the serious hots for him, but he keeps turning her down out of respect for his marriage.
 Middle brother was engaged to a Jewish girl, but it broke up due to his own moral and emotional conflicts.  Later on, he then picks up an old friendship with the Irish-American girl that grew up next door.  She repairs cars in the backyard, drinks beer like the guys and has big hair to remind you she's a girl.  I liked her better anyway.
 The youngest brother is the most likable.  He hasn't been a practicing Catholic since junior high; yet, he considers himself a believer.  His charismatic crudeness and way of treating woman remind me of the characters Sean Penn plays, but this guy's got better personality and looks.  Both older brothers tell him he drinks too much, but I'd say he drinks just the right amount for his age and station in life!  He doesn't seem sexually repressed to me, but his slightly overplayed male bluster and beer drinking might suggest to a shrink that he's keeping his true feelings on ice.
At first glance I thought the McMullen family didn't typify mine--the brothers seem like libertines by comparison!  But they call movies and plays drama because they're supposed to dramatize.  I think the characters act out things that all of us have thought, felt, wished we'd done, experienced or observed, either consciously or unconsciously.  The incongruity of values and lifestyle between the conventional straight-laced oldest brother and the carousing youngest brother was interesting.  Unlike most men and unlike most Irish-Catholics, the brothers talk about all their conflicts with each other and their wives and girl friends (Otherwise, there wouldn't be a movie!).
There's some funny, typically Catholic hypocrisy.  Middle brother is sleeping with his Jewish girlfriend.  When they go looking for an apartment together, he decides they can't live together before marriage because he's Catholic.  In another scene, they are in bed together having hank-panky and he tells her they shouldn't be using contraceptives because he's Catholic.  Oops.  I didn't use the word sex or intercourse.  Does that make me sexually repressed?
Apparently, if a woman pursues a man and he's attracted to her, but he chooses to remain faithful to his wife, Hollywood considers that sexually repressed.  And if a person is torn between what they've been taught is right and what their passions command, that is considered sexually repressed.  I'd call it being a normal human being.  I don't think the movie makers were trying to portray the youngest brother as liberated; rather, I think they were trying to portray him as another kind of emotional cripple, but I'm on shaky ground here.
I thought the brothers did O.K. in their relationships to others, but I was a little disappointed that none of the brothers lacked the intellectual depth and sophistication to sort out and resolve their inner conflicts.  This is the real tragedy.
Unfortunately, the movie barely touches on the woman's point of view.  It would make a great sequel.",1026604800,20,3879,4.956656346749226
750454,2,6303952984,"I'm going to paraphrase a real critic on this one only because when I read his review it was side-splittingly funny: ""The men in 'Brothers McMullen' can't do so much as screw in a light bulb without putting on a Notre Dame sweatshirt and cracking open a Guinness"" (Joe Queenan). Read his 'Red Lobster, White Trash and the Blue Lagoon'... but I digress.
There was one great line in this movie when MacGlone's character finds out his girlfriend isn't pregnant and he won't have to make agonizing decisions about abortion and religion and whether he wants to marry the woman. He's strolling through his girlfriend's father's clothing store and says (to himself) something like, ""Thank you, God. She's not pregnant. Oh thank you thank you God...... but.... will you just look at these sweaters?!?"" It's a great laugh in a film that isn't full of them unless you subscribe to laughing at Irish-Catholic stereotypes for 90 minutes. I don't know a single Irish-American who has subjected himself to ethical dilemmas 24/7 like McGlone's character. Give him a hot dog on a Friday during Lent and watch him have an aneurysm. Now that would be a movie. I mean... OK! I get it! He's tightly wound Super Catholic Man. Duh! Stop pounding me over the head with it.
The acting is spotty. Note to aspiring filmmakers, do not cast Maxine Bahns in any part requiring dialogue. She delivers dialogue like Downtown Furniture delivered my couch: clumsily. Her words will bang up against the door jambs of your cinematic sensibilities, will scrape the hardwood floors of your threshold for mindless drivel and will tear the upholstery from your couch of sincerity.",1013644800,4,1641,4.885304659498208

It explores what it is like to be an Irish-Catholic, and how they live their lives. Edward Burns is plays a charming, cynic who no longer believes in love. WHO COULDN'T RELATE TO THAT? Great movie about everything that is good, being Irish, being religious, having great friends family, and lovers. Edward Burns is a very talented man, who stays true to his Irish roots.
