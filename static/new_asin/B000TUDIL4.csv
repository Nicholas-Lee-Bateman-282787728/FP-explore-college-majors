2910300,3,B000TUDIL4,"Anyone looking into a movie called ""Flight of the Living Dead"" must be aware that a certain amount of tongue is in cheek.  The title is the best thing about the film, and that's too bad, because the idea of a zombie outbreak on a flight is terrifying.

It could have been a very frightening movie if done with some sophistication and thought.  It could have been an answer to Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD and it's caricaturing of American consumerism.  Imagine a zombie movie that reflects our new found fear of terrorism in the air...it all seems so obvious that it makes the film makers' decision to lampoon SNAKES ON A PLANE seem like kind of a let down.

So in the end we have a fun, low budget zombie movie with a few laughs and some pretty decent special effects and make up for what must have been a tiny budget.  Fans of the genre should see it:  It does contain a moment of ingenuity.  A grandmother-turned-zombie catches one of the surviving humans and begins to bite his arm.  She hasn't got any teeth though, just gums, so she can't break the skin and cause the zombie infection!  I found that clever.

I'll give it three stars.  It really isn't any worse than SNAKES ON A PLANE (minus Samuel L. Jackson's charisma) and I was always entertained.  I just wish it realized how wonderful a film it could have been.",1191888000,,1320,4.404958677685951
2910301,5,B000TUDIL4,After fast forwarding thru so many utterly worthless direct to video crapfests this was a VERY pleasant surprise. I enjoyed the heck out of it! Although it may not really be a 5 star flick it's worth 10 compared to much of that stuff out there. Highly recommended to zombie lovers!,1191801600,2,281,4.529411764705882
2910302,5,B000TUDIL4,This is a great and fun living dead movie-well done.  For zombie and living dead movie collectors this is a must have. THOROUGHLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE!!!,1191715200,3,151,4.8076923076923075
2910303,5,B000TUDIL4,"Best Zombie movie since the remake of Dawn of the Dead. maybe even better than Zach Snyder. No lulls, exciting from start to finish...
A must have. A must see. Anyone that thinks this is not good must have had his eyes shut out of fear!",1191715200,4,236,4.1521739130434785
2910304,3,B000TUDIL4,"The title says it all.  Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane is exactly what it says: a glorified D-horror movie that should have basically been called Zombies on a Plane.  Surprisingly though, Flight of the Living Dead isn't all that bad, and in spots it's actually kind of enjoyable to boot.  There isn't a whole lot in terms of plot to be found here (like I said, the title says it all and tells you everything you really need to know), but there's enough bloody fun to be had here.  The blood and gore effects are decent enough for a low budget, direct to DVD horror flick, and there's some familiar faces to be found here including Pet Semetery's Dale Midkiff and The Mummy's Kevin J. O'Connor.  It's campy and kind of goofy, and if you're reading this, chances are you already know what you're getting with Flight of the Living Dead.  As an afterthought, maybe New Line should have released this theatrically instead of Snakes on a Plane.",1191715200,30,954,4.517441860465116
2910305,5,B000TUDIL4,"Of course it's gross, of course it's not Shakespeare, it's zombies on an airline flight.  If you've ever flown late-night into Philadelphia on USAirways with checked baggage, you'll already have experienced these horrors.

Fun, escapist fare.",1191369600,4,242,5.694444444444445
2910306,4,B000TUDIL4,"I will totally admit that this movie is not going to win video of the year or anything, but damn - its a FUN zombie movie.  You have key characters that turn into zombies - and I think the zombie makeup is actually quite creepy.  (I love the nun at the end who gets it!)

You can pretty much imagine the plot and the plot twists - since it does not take a rocket scientist to figure this movie out, but if you are looking for a good entertaining zombie romp (yes, I said 'romp') then this might be your kind of movie!",1190678400,6,517,4.0
2910307,1,B000TUDIL4,"I wouldn't know where to begin in describing this... movie(I use the term loosely)

Do NOT buy this. If you MUST see it simply to satiate your curiosity, try borrowing it, renting it,... hell, even download it. Trust me you won't be missing anything groundbreaking with the sub-par visual effects, poor acting, and lame story.

You want a synopsis of the movie? Think ""Airplane""(only not at all funny) and cross it with any generic non-Romero zombie flick. There... you've got ""Flight of the Living Dead.""

Thumbs down!",1189987200,6,519,4.942528735632184
2910308,2,B000TUDIL4,"I went into this not expecting much & rightly so after watching it.  You thought ""Snakes On A Plane"" was bad, watch out cause it gets worse.  If this movie were on cable & you could watch it for free when you have nothing better to do, maybe.  This movie is absolutely not worth a rental much less actually paying full price to own it.  The
acting & plot actually weren't half bad, it's the directing &
special effects that really kill the movie.  The characters are even
likeable for the most part aside from the annoying teenager types &
their pointless to the plot love triangle that take up the majority
of the 1st hour of the movie.
You basically have a plane transporting a ""return Of The Living
Dead"" style toxin with a zombie lady inside.  The plane hits rough
weather, the container opens, & carnage follows.  The 1st 45 minutes
of the movie is just character drama, & bad CGI shots of the plane.
Back & forth, back & forth; it gets REALLY old.  Then when the
zombies finally do show up the make-up is done well enough, but the
blood is that kinda watery pink & completely unbelievable stuff you see in the lower budgeted
horror flicks.  The gore is pretty tame & really isn't there other
than alot of blood.  You'll see the bite about to happen & then the
camera pulls away, never really any good gut munching any where to
be found.
The other thing that really kills this film is the shear
implausibility of everything that goes on.  Given this is a Zombie
movie that takes place on a plane, I understand there are already
some believabilty issues with that, get past that though & you'll
still have a really hard time.  For starters there are tons of guns
on this plane that are going off constantly that never manage to
breach the plane, people walking around with golf clubs & footballs;
just stuff you don't normally see on your average flight.  Then if &
when you get past that there are bombs going off inside the plane
with huge explosions that only seem to harm zombies & don't do any
real damage to the plane.  The plane even gets hit by a missle &
manages to stay in the sky.  All this happens mind you while the
plane is on auto pilot because the pilots are both bitten about
halfway through the movie.  Then you've got zombies ripping through
the floor from the luggage area to get to passengers with their bare
hands & smashing threw the mirrors in the bathroom, just kinda lame
stuff that impossible stuff that they make look like it happens
everyday.  I'd mentioned the bad CGI earlier, well let me just
reaffirm that once more.  The CGI you get outta this movie is
really, REALLY bad.  I've seen better CGI on TV, this is the sloppy
amateur hour stuff you'll be used to if you've seen many low budget
direct to DVD action/sci-fi/horror flicks of recent years.
I really can't recommend this movie.  While it may be better than
say Zombiez, House Of The Dead (1&2), Return Of The Living Dead
(4&5), & Day Of The Dead 2 Contagion (basically anything Lions Gate
or Anchor Bay have done direct to video the exception being Uwe's
movies :P), that ain't hard to do & does not make this good.  I
strongly caution anyone to spend any kind of money on this what so
ever (even a rental).  Don't say I didn't warn you!",1188432000,13,3232,4.3875838926174495
2910309,5,B000TUDIL4,"You have herd of Snakes on a Plane and Snakes on a train but have you herd of Plain of the Dead aka Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane? Directed by Scott Thomas, the director of Deranged (2001).

This movie rocks! It is full of blood, gore, action and some suspense and eroticism! A must have for any Zombie fan, get your copy today! this is one cool Zombie flick!

Plot line: On a flight from Los Angeles to Paris, a mad scientist on the run from the CIA is transporting a coffin containing the body of a colleague infected with a genetically modified virus. While the 747 crosses a violent thunderstorm, the instability of the aircraft allows the corpse to get out of its container. The flesh-eating zombie quickly starts to spread the virus, infecting many of the passengers which now will have to fight for their lives stranded in the air with no way out...

Multiple viewings and I still laugh when hearing some of the one liners.  You will hate a few of the actors but you are supposed to.  You will really like some of the actors but guess what?  Spoiler alert;  Watch the Asian Gentleman who as far as I am concerned really got the short end of the stick.  It truly is low budget Zomedy Gold!,1433289600,,444,4.0344827586206895

2910323,3,B000TUDIL4,"The long title is a dead giveaway, in case you had any doubts.  The plot is pretty much what you'd expect from an outbreak of zombieitis during a long flight during a bad storm where everything that could possibly go wrong does.  The passengers are all worth eating, most are absolute idiots or bitter malcontents (I'm almost certain that trying to play football during a fight would be frowned upon so why even try to get away with it).  I wasn't sorry to see any of them go.  Sadly, it takes forever before the zombie outbreak even gets started.  When it finally gets going its because of a trigger happy guard with a machinegun in the cargo area of the plane.  (Just what you'd need during a flight, gunfire from all quarters.  It's surprising just how many guns popped up during the course of the movie.)  I suppose points should be given just for having the gall to film a plot this uninspired.  Oddly enough, it manages to produce a few chuckles along the way and there is a certain appeal to watching all these dopey characters meet their demise then get up and go after someone else.  They even toss in an escaped prisoner who manages to hide while most of the mayhem takes place.  No surprise, the military comes up with its standardized way of dealing with problems.....when in doubt, blow it up.
The only dilemma I have now concerns the disk not working in my Blu-ray player or my backup DVD player.  I finally had to whip out the laptop in order to watch it.  So it immediately lost points for putting me through all that trouble.  (Also, there's no point in keeping it to watch again when it only works on my laptop.)",1390262400,,1630,4.444444444444445

There are some hilarious one liners and ridiculous kills that any zombie fan will enjoy. I really hate the camera stops and the cheesy effects, but there are times when it works.

But believe me, this one will get you to the edge of your seat. I love it, and I don't get tired watching it again and again.

2910338,4,B000TUDIL4,"Flight Of The Living Dead: Outbreak On A Plane (2007) melds two well established genres, airplane disasters, and zombies, into a hyper-violent and gory tale, that features many familiar and clichd situations, while also breaking some new ground, while featuring some scenes that probably have not been done before.

The point of a film like this is to highlight gore and gratuitous violence, so it matters very little that much of what happens on this commercial flight from Los Angeles to Paris is completely implausible and silly.  No matter how ridiculous things get, the tone remains serious, with just a few splashes of comic relief.  When a hole opens up in the floor, and zombies start pulling people in, or when numerous gunshots fail to penetrate the hull and cause the plane to depressurize, these are things you just go along with.

Like many Zombie films, the violence explodes exponentially, as victims killed by the zombies, rise to seek victims of their own.  The mayhem peaks in the third act as various zombies are sucked out of the plane, a makeshift bomb is exploded, and a fighter plane appears, threatening to blow the airliner out of the sky.

A genetically engineered virus is responsible for re-animating the dead.  The zombies are of the fast moving enraged variety, that can only be temporarily put out of action by bullets.  They don't stay down for long, which makes destroying them extremely problematic, and encourages excessive violence.  The primary survivors are law enforcement officer Truman Burrows (David Chisum), his prisoner Frank Strathmore (Kevin J. O'Connor), Megan (Kristen Kerr), a flight attendant, air marshal Paul Judd (Richard Tyson), golfer William Freeman (Derek Webster), his wife Anna (Siena Goines), and Dr. Bennett (Erick Avari) one of the scientists responsible for developing the virus.

When a passenger or member of the crew is killed, they typically return as a zombie.  Unlike many films, where the zombies are unknown, here nearly every one of the undead is familiar, with several that come back repeatedly.  This contributes to a feeling that the army of the undead is growing and inexorably closing in.  The undead don't stay down for long, so the madcap carnage becomes quite intense.

The CGI for the exterior shots of the plane are satisfactory, but not that convincing.  Mostly practical effects are used for the zombies, although CG is employed at times.  Interesting scenes include a bomb being exploded to clear out a brood of zombies, a zombie getting an umbrella shoved through her head, and a zombie being sucked into a jet engine.  The film also features a remarkable number of zombies being shot, particularly in the head.

Given the type of film this is, the actors play their roles very well.  David Chisum is solid as the leader of the group, while Kevin J. O'Connor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deep-Rising/dp/6305090564/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deep Rising</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Mummy-1999/dp/B000IEVW6E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Mummy (1999)</a>), Richard Tyson, and Derek Webster, play slightly offbeat characters who add some humor into the mix.  Zombie films often have bleak endings, and that seems to be the case here as well, until some cartoonish airplane disaster clichs are employed.

The film is subtitled in English, and the DVD has some decent extras including two commentary tracks, bloopers, and some trailers.  All in all, Flight Of The Living Dead is quite entertaining, delivering a planeload of bloody mayhem.  If you are seeking a zombie horror/comedy that offers a few things you may not have seen before, you might give the movie a chance.",1323993600,,3746,5.365811965811965

2910340,4,B000TUDIL4,"Not bad movie! I liked how Kristen Kerr played in it along with any other actors. Somehow a plane appeared to look more flat than round when it was landed, and some of the gunshots, blood splashes, were too badly animated.

2910344,3,B000TUDIL4,"This is a good low budget straight to video Zombie pic. It takes a new twist on the genre by using a plane as the setting, is it is scary and at the same time funny. A science experiment goes bad and soon the the passengers on the plane are exposed and are trapped thousands of feet in the air, chased by zombies. You have to see the scene when you have an old woman that becomes a zombie, but has no teeth so her bite is harmless and one passenger that becomes zombiefied is stuck in his seat the whole movie and tries in vain to reach people. Nice entertaining film.",1311984000,,568,4.080357142857143
2910345,4,B000TUDIL4,"OK I was not expecting much here. A straight to video zombie flick and an obvious attempt (or so I thought)to cash in on the lousy 'snakes on a plane' Well it turns out that this is a great little zombie flick! There is actually some decent character development before all hell breaks loose. I actually cared about what happened to the main characters. The plot was probably written on a napkin but it works and is executed nicely. There are some great gore effects, creative killings, and several laugh out loud moments. Fans of movies like return of the living dead and dead alive won't be disappointed. Much better than recent zombie failures like land of the dead, day of the dead (remake), and Shaun of the dead (not a failure but stinks in my opinion). This deserved a theatrical release, although it probably would have had trouble because of the ridiculous premise. At first glance this looks like it should have been canceled at liftoff. Don't be fooled, this is one great flight you should be sure to catch. Highly recommended.",1310515200,,1038,4.6775956284153
2910346,3,B000TUDIL4,"Not since Samuel L. Jackson cussed out about effing snakes on the plane has there been such gross aggravation during an airline flight. I recommend FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, a horror title that couldn't give away the plot any clearer. Concord 239's transatlantic trip to Paris ultimately teeters on the ill-fated side when a group of nervous government scientist/doctor types commandeers the plane's cargo hold as site for their mysterious special container, a container which, by the way, requires an armed guard in a CDC containment suit. So couple that worrying turn of event with the Concord captain's just mentioning that this is his last flight and how he's looking forward to a long vacation with his family and, well, the uh-oh alarm should be going off in your head.

The same reason a purse snatcher doesn't ply his trade on a plane, one shouldn't sneak a zombie on board. Because where are you gonna run? FLIGHT OF THE CONCORD takes time to introduce its victi- er, passengers, and there's that usual fun found in predicting which ones may survive and which ones are clearly meat snacks (hint: if you're insufferably rude or vacuous or a nun, you're effin' doomed). Dramatis personae include a U.S. Marshall transporting a prisoner, two arguing young couples, a trio of hot stewardesses, the pilots, a TSA agent, the smug head scientist guy, and a famous black golfer who, in his first scene, can be seen polishing his putter (but it's not as dirty as it sounds). The rest in the cabin are just there for window dressing and they'll be milling around accruing bite marks soon enough. The acting is actually pretty decent, for what it is. There are some recognizable B-movie actors here, the most interesting of whom is Kevin J. O'Connor who - as someone in the IGN audio commentary remarks - looks as if John Malkovich and John Waters had a baby. O'Connor simply has a face that even his own mother wouldn't trust, but he gets the plum con artist/prisoner role anyway. He throws out some pretty choice one-liners. Erick Avari plays the unflappable, despicable scientist who sneers at everyone, except that later, gratifyingly, he's reduced to a shrieking pansy pounding on the cabin door for help. It did my heart good, watching that scene. The other guy I recognized is Richard Tyson.

When Concord 239 battles thru a whopping storm, massive turbulence releases the content of the container in the cargo hold, and, really, that's all she wrote for most of the crew and passengers. It's an infected woman who emerges from the container and the dumb git of a guard doesn't have the skills to fend her off. Before you know it, patient zero has her undead backup.

Interestingly, other than the stupidity of having a zombie on board in the first place, the fall of Concord 239 can be blamed mostly on inclement weather. The co-pilot has to descend into the cargo hold to check on some busted electrical something or other and then, of course, there's nothing but for the head scientist guy to send his lackeys to the cargo hold to check on the special container. Another spat of turbulence coldcocl<s the U.S. Marshall which allows his prisoner (O'Connor) to escape. Logic then dictates that, once a search of the cabin proves fruitless, the U.S. Marshall and the TSA agent would assume that the prisoner had gone into hiding in the cargo hold. There are only so many places, after all. Anyway, this and that happens in bloody fashion, and the zombie outbreak soon spreads beyond the cargo hold.

There's something to be said for staging even a sort of cheesy horror show in confined spaces, it just ratches up that tension. FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is one of those flicks you enjoy watching with your homies, preferably with a sippy or two. It's just good campy horror, and there's just enough intentional dark humor injected to let you know the filmmakers are in on the fun. The zombie make-up isn't anything fancy, but it does the job. The flick doesn't stint on the gore and blood and some of the kills are pretty decent (I'll never go to the bathroom again in mid-flight, nor crawl thru the air ducts). But there really aren't enough legitimate scares, although you get the feeling the writers were pounding their heas against the wall trying to think up inventive places from which the zombies could pop out. But, again, there are only so many places. It's interesting that, this time around, you don't have to shoot a zombie solely in the brain to kill it. Superior firepower directed at any body part will do the trick. And, somehow, all the bullets flying around don't end up compromising hull integrity. Lucky passengers. In that sense.

To demonstrate that safety belts really can save your life, one zombified passenger finds himself still strapped in and, being brain dead, is unable to extricate himself. I actually felt sorry for the guy and was actively rooting for him to successfully grab one of the meat-on-legs running by him.

I know better than to expect too much from low budget films, so my expectations were low for this one.  The zombie and gore effects are good enough, so is the acting, and the action, once it begins, is relentless.  However an interesting story and more compelling characters would have made the first half of this story, which tells us who the characters are, and explains why there's gonna be a bunch of zombies reeking havoc on a plane, a lot more fun and interesting.  That's probably gonna keep this from being a timeless, classic, low budget zombie movie.  However, the second half is non stop zombie mayhem, and lots of fun.

It's a B+ budget (as in better than most low budget) as it appears they had enough to hire some actors you'll actually recognize from TV and bigger movies. They also spent a little on CGI. You can tell in a few parts that the money for the CGI ran out as a few external shots of the Plane are bad, but it doesn't really detract from the movie. It's about the zombies, and we get a planeload of them in this film along with a few laughs.

The plan: one of the scientists is infected so is transported via plane in a special container under armed guard. Not that they think the scientist within is a threat, just that they don't want anyone stealing the container.

The plane encounters a severe thunderstorm and is rocked all over the place. Sure enough, the container is no longer secure and the person within is brought back to life. First goes the guard . . . then goes everyone else.

Also on board--in coach--is a cop named Truman Burrows (David Chisum) and a criminal, Frank (Kevin J. O'Connor), being transported for trial. Soon these two must set aside their differences if they are to survive this doomed flight.

Outbreak on a plane? You bet.

Big trouble? You better believe it.

The premise for this movie is just plain cool: zombies on a plane (sounds familiar, don't it?). Good stuff. My question going into this was: okay, you got a plane full of zombies, but only so much room. How can you fill a whole movie without people getting slaughtered inside of fifteen minutes? Sure enough, the writers thought of that and managed to at first slowly let the zombies rise then, due to the large plane and various compartments therein, give our main band of heroes some room to run around and not get eaten.

The zombies were scary, especially their eyes. Really good makeup. There was plenty of action and enough blood and guts to make any horror fan happy.

The only thing I thought was kind of weak was the pilot's insistence on not setting the plane down once the undead outbreak occurred. Can't you land on more than just a long stretch of road? How about a field? Even a water landing? Better to take a chance with those than watch your passengers get eaten.

This is one of those B-movies that make you happy you love B-movies, you know? There's a sense of B-horror pride with this one. Hard to place it, but it's there. More than once I was going, ""Oh man, this is so good!"" Maybe it's the acting. Maybe it's the grade of the film. Maybe the effects. I don't know . . . but it's good.

Fun flick. Check it out.

I'm glad I added Flight of the Living Dead to my collection.

And on a personal note, I had the privilege of publishing one of the co-writers of this movie, Mark Onspaugh, in my science-gone-wrong zombie anthology, Dead Science. His story is called ""The Decay of Unknown Particles."" Cool.

2910358,4,B000TUDIL4,"I have always been interested in this one.  I saw ""Snakes on the Plane"" and thought it was ok but nothing spectacular but what better movie idea than to have zombies running free on a plane with nowhere to run?  It sounded like a spectacular plot idea to me!  I love Z Grade zombie horror movies and this one really sounded like it would fit the bill, heck for $5.99 it was worth a try.

I sat down to watch it and really didn't expect too much, but boy was I surprised.  This one is actually very good for what it is.  The nice thing about this flick is that they didn't put a whole lot of back story in it, it starts and you are already on the plane.  The action takes a few minutes to build as they explain why there are going to be zombies on the plane and then off it goes.  This thing is a non stop rollercoaster ride of zombie mayhem.

It is pretty relentless once the action starts going and I guarantee that you won't be bored by it.  There are even some comedic moments in it to lighten the mood and it looks like that the cast and crew of this movie had a great time while shooting it.  You can almost feel that in the film.  They knew that they weren't creating the next great epic horror film but a fun ride for 90 minutes.

If you aren't into zombies and bloodletting then this is not the type of film for you, it's not overly gory but I'm jaded as I've seen 1000's of horror films and I don't really realize something is really gory unless it's completely over the top.

2910362,3,B000TUDIL4,"Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane (Scott Thomas, 2007)

I'm sure I've asked this before in recent reviews, since by my mental count I've now noticed it four times in horror flicks I've watched over the past couple of weeks, but I shall ask it again: why is it that horror movie foley artists are so drawn to the sound effects from the first two Doom games? If it's a zombie movie made in the past ten years or so (and even some non-zombie movies), there's almost a guarantee that if you listen hard enough, you're going to hear a zombie marine, an imp, a revenant, or (even in auto commercials!) the big boss on the final level of Doom 2. Since I started noticing it, it's become quite an annoyance, and in general, I give a movie automatic points off for using them. There are, however, exceptions to every rule, and my exception to this one seems to be movies that are already so incredibly stupid, and yet so fun, that they defy having points taken off for, well, anything. Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane is one of those movies. It's bad, of course it's bad. But really, you don't go into a movie with this title expecting Billy Wilder. If you do, you deserve what you get. The rest of us will be too busy laughing to commiserate with you.

The clichs start coming thick and fast as soon as the script begins; you'll probably be unsure whether this is supposed to be a ripoff of Snakes on a Plane or Airplane! at first. Which is okay, that's what the writers wanted you to think. (I assume, anyway.) And if you think about it, those two movies had quite a bit in common anyway; a cast of established B-list stars and has-beens, unintentional humor weaved in with the intentional stuff, a great sense of comic timing for both, and surprisingly solid character development for its main stars, even if the minor characters were cardboard in the extreme. All of these also apply to Flight of the Living Dead. David Chisum (One Life to Live) is a cop escorting a criminal of the evil-mastermind type (Lord of Illusions' Kevin J. O'Connor). The stewardesses? Kristen Kerr (Inland Empire) and Mieko Hillman (American Empress). The slightly crazy guy who makes everyone ill at ease? Richard Tyson (Black Hawk Down), playing his low-rent-Val-Kilmer thing up as much as possible. Pilot and Co-pilot? Raymond J. Barry (Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story) and Todd Babcock (Gods and Monsters). You get the idea. This is not a cast that's going to completely blow it; someone's going to do it right. Every once in a while in a movie like this, everyone does it right, and this is one of these movies. Another thing all three movies I'm comparing have in common is that they wouldn't work unless everyone involved played it as if they were taking it seriously. And it works here just as well as it did in those two movies. (You'll notice I've avoided the usual plot synopsis. That's because, well, you shouldn't need it. I mean, I think this is even the same set from Snakes on a Plane!)

If all this makes you feel the next sentence in this review should be ""if you liked Airplane! and/or Snakes on a Plane..."", you're right. This manages to be both a parody of an earlier film and a worthy piece of celluloid on its own. As long as you approach it with the right mindset, it's a great deal of fun and well worth your time. ***",1233964800,,3342,4.457516339869281

2910364,3,B000TUDIL4,"""Zombies on a Plane""--""Dead Flight""--""Drop Dead Flight""--the possibilities for alternate titles for Scott Thomas' ""Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane"" is endless. The film is insanely goofy and while it couldn't exactly reach the B-movie charms of ""Snakes on a Plane"", it is still a fun watch for those lazy night evenings when there is nothing good on TV.

In a transatlantic flight, a secret agency is transporting the corpse of a woman who is the carrier of a man-made virus. The weather isn't very good to make such a flight, there is a thunderstorm, turbulence is aplenty which eventually results on zombies literally running rampant in a plane at 130,000 feet. Cue, sexy flight attendants, a comedic convict, two tough guys and even a nun to save the day....but how do you fight an horde of the undead when there is nowhere to go?

""Snakes (ahem) Flight of the Living Dead"" is a zany gorefest, and very humorous in its execution. True, the opening act of the film is rather boring with the introduction of boring and dull characters; surfer dudes with their bimbo girlfriends, the smooth talking con accompanied by a federal agent, sexy and lusty flight attendants, a professional golf player and his wife, mad scientists who are bent on changing the world for profit and a nun. The film's characters are very clichd and quite uninteresting. The film's main premise is very similar to ""Snakes on a Plane"" but sadly, the film has no nudity and only hinted at sex.

Thankfully, after the corpse escapes the coffin, the film goes into overdrive. There is a lot of visual blood and gore, and while the violence is more funny than scary most of the time, well, the film is never boring and proves quite entertaining in a goofy way. The smooth talking convict is responsible for most of the film's goofy banter and the humorous touches with the zombie attack just made me laugh my socks off. A grandma zombie with no teeth, umbrella attack and zombie who never figures out how the seatbelt works is just freaking hilarious, among other stuff.

The zombies themselves are visceral looking and they look very bestial and fast-moving; nope they are not like the zombies in the classic Romero films but more like the ones in ""28 weeks Later"". The film never makes any attempts for cheap scares, the film is fast-paced and more an action film than anything else. The one issue I have with ""Flight.."" is that the filmmakers seemed poised to take itself seriously in the first half with the boring and shallow character development. Truth be told, no viewer who would sit through ""zombies on a 747"" would care for any of those factors. The film also has a less-than stellar cast made up of Dale Midkiff, Erick Avari, Richard Tyson, David Chisum, Kevin J. O'Connor, and Kristen Kerr. Then again, what A-list actor would be caught in a movie like this? I mean this in a good way.

There is zero suspense to be had and the film offers no surprises. It doesn't seem necessary to shoot the zombies here in the head--as an Air Marshal says: ""two in the chest and one in the balls.."" is quite sufficient. The film is not to be taken seriously and it is definitely a lot of fun to watch. There is a lot of overused elements here but who cares? A zombie take on ""Snakes on a Plane"" may not be deep or worthy of an Oscar, but no one can deny that the film is a lot of fun.

Within five minutes I was hooked.

First of all, it's clearly not a recent flight.  There were no crying kids, baggage fees, or morons speaking loudly on their Bluetooth headseats.  The stewardesses are young, hot, and flirtatious (as opposed to worn-out cougars and gay dudes), which makes the viewers more empathic.  One such hottie, Megan (Kirsten Kerr), is going about her duties when a bad turbulence causes cargo to shift, injuring a guard in the HAZMAT suit (cue ominous music), and a cryogenic freezer of some kind busts open.  Uh oh.

The typical disaster film characters are here, from the old pilot on his last flight to the bimbo flight attendants to the evil scientist to the cheating boyfriend.  Not much in the way of plot because after all, the title says it all. This time around, the zombie virus comes from a ""new strain of malaria"" which apparently in addition with Russo-style running, leaping zombies, also makes them scream like the velociraptors from Jurassic Park.

I was a bit skeptical upon purchasing this film.  However, I have to admit that I was pleasantly surprised with this film.  The acting, gore and special effects were all pretty decent.  At times a bit cheesy, but has enough bite to revive the genre.  Zombie fans should seriously consider this for their collection.  An overall fun film.",1215734400,,564,4.450980392156863
2910371,2,B000TUDIL4,"just picked this up a few days ago after reading some positive reviews on here about it and i was sorely dissapointed.
the plot is simple, group of scientists are in flight to paris with one fot he scientists' wife in the cargohold in an icebox cus she contracted a deadly virus they were working on for military purposes. turbulence causes the container to open and the guard to become incapacitated and its a slow ride to goretown from there.

here's the thing though. it was too damn slow. the plane isn't super crowded, the characters are laughable in concept (a nun, two college couples an asian guy whos seat belt doesnt work, a convict and his chaperone a tiger woods knock off the scientists and some gestapo looking fellow who is actuall a federal air martial)
the zombie action doesnt even start until thrity plus minutes into the film because they folks who put this together felt it necessary to fill in backstorys to characters who are gonna get eaten anyway and the zombie scene in that part sucks. the woman comes out of the cooler perfectly fine with a bit of a headache and doesnt turn until the idiot in the hazmat suit pumps her full of uzilead.
you won't see zombies again until almost an hour into the movie and when you do?

let's just say they all have those hundred dollar wild eyes contact lenses that darthmaul wore in starwars nott he traditional milky glazed over eyes and their wounds look like donpost standbys you could get at the halloween store.the only zombie they really actually looked like theytryed to make an effort into looking scary was dr. talbott who is very laughable in their attempt.

and with all the explosions and guns going off in the plane you'd think they would either lose cabin pressure or just explode. this does not happen.

there were a few saving points to it that were more for comedy sake than anything else.like when the asian guy who couldn't get out of his seat is turned into a zombie and is booted off the plane, seat and all and crashes into a fighter jet......................

there isn't even any panty action or tits to save the lack of plot.
oh yes and there is a horrible death scene in which the copilot is shot in the head and fumbles around groaning for a full minute before faling over-i actually yelled ""just f!@#$ing fall over already!"" at the monitor.

this is a bad bad movie.
i'm actually gonna be selling mine at the local used dvd store due to its badness.
it's not redneck zombies or astro zombies bad but its bad.

2910372,5,B000TUDIL4,"Okay, what the F***?! Zombies on a plane? Yes, the premise is predictable, you know how it ends.....or do you? This film is just a lot of fun! I've seen just about all the zombie flicks ever released, and to tell the truth, things were getting a little old. The colorized version of ""Night of the Living Dead"" was a big mistake, in my opinion, and there was nothing since ""28 Days Later"" that added a bit of zest to the genre....until now.

In ""Flight of the Living Dead"", there is secret cargo in the hold of the plane, with an unsuspecting crew and passengers aboard. There is the requisite storm that can't be flown around, and a knucklehead security guy in the hold of the plane, presumably there to watch over the secret cargo. The storm takes it's toll, and the first thing you're thinking when the box containing said cargo opens, and a woman pops out is No, don't shoot! Well, the security guy does, and the film delivers solid jolts from then on.

While the premise is not original, being on a plane is new (even if it has been done before, like ""Snakes on a plane""), and 30,000 feet is a lousy place to be, when you are running from a cabin load of zombies! The cast is made up of unknowns, essentially, except maybe for a couple of actors who make a living doing ""B"" flicks. They do a good job here, though.

There's not much in the special features department, but the film is a pretty good way to spend 94 minutes on a Friday night, or any other night, for that matter!",1210291200,,1482,4.304659498207886

Boy was I surprised:  this film actually manages to be a good zombie movie!

Every other zombie movie out there is the same old story of a group of people trying to survive in the woods.  The setting of an airplane is a new twist.  Truthfully, I found this movie more entertaining than ""Snakes!""  Although there are some stereotypical characters, they are acted pretty well.  Several of the actors you will recognize from small roles in other films.  With the exception of some CGI gunshot wounds, the special effects are top notch.  Since such a good job is done with the other wounds and special effects, that is hardly a sin worth noting.

The movie is similar to ""Snakes on a Plane"" in which a 747 becomes infested with Zombies. Since the film did not gain a commercial release, it was released directly to DVD. While seemily outrageous in premise when you think about it, this film actually pulls off the concept quite well and is enjoyable. Mixing comedy with a serious tone throughout, Flight of the Lving Dead is a real 'scream'... ;)

2910376,3,B000TUDIL4,"First thing you have to realize is that 99% (that's my own percentage) of all straight to DVD zombie movies are not going to be of quality production. But if you are a fan of 'B' movies or zombie movies, you will test your patience with any movie with a zombie face on the cover.

First I'll let you know about the quality of the movie. The actors aren't really that bad. They all did a decent job I thought (remember... I said decent). The picture quality looks good too. I was a little worried that it would look like someone bought a camcorder from Best Buy, filmed the movie, and decided to go a little crazy with special effect from Windows Movie editor. But nope, it was nicely shot. The plot, hehe, well... I love the plot. Pure 'what the hell?' type of plot for a zombie movie. The special effects were oh so bad, but in a great way. For instance...this one person gets shot with an Uzi or something and three holes appear on the front side of the person. Completely done in very bad CG. As the person falls, the holes don't move at first and then have to catch up. I almost died from my heart overflowing with love for that part of the movie. I knew I was in for some very good 'B' quality action.

The one part about the details of the movie that I think deserves its own little paragraph is the zombie makeup. I thought this part was better than average for a zombie movie of this caliber. Yellow eyes have always freaked me out since Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' video. The zombies were actually pretty scary looking. Especially the ones that had some decent close ups.

As for the movie itself, I really liked it, even though it was quite unbelievable. No way in hell would someone be able to put something 'top secret' on a plane without the airline or whatever knowing about it. And if it was toxic or whatever they said it was (I can't remember), there is no way they would let civilians on the plane. I mean if it was something like Anthrax and it was accidentally released on the aircraft and people survived it, they would sue for a million bajillion dollars. No way would a company take that risk. Yes, this is one of the many parts of the movie where you will roll your eyes at, but you don't care...you know why? Cause you are here for one reason and one reason only. To watch zombies kill humans and then, depending on what type of person you are, seeing the last stand and the few humans left defeating the zombies... or... getting eaten and the zombies walk to the next victim somewhere else off camera.

Flight of the Living Dead starts off on a plane. No waiting around in the lobby, no going to the airport, we are on the plane already. Some scientists have stored a secret 'chemical' on the plane. We see old and young couples, stewardesses (all hot flirty women btw which is also completely unbelievable since I always seem to get an older lady, a not so good looking lady, or a gay guy), the pilots, scientists, a police officer with a convict, and even a nun. A nun. Yeeaahh...I wonder what's gonna happen to the nun. They fly into bad weather which causes the plane to hit a lot of turbulence, which, guess what happens....YEP...it busts open the 'secret' container, which release the 'chemical' onto the plane. From slow to fast the action begins and the transformations begin. Zombies are on the plane and so is the breaking loose of Hell.

Now there is two thoughts that I'd like to leave you with.

1. Whoever makes that plane should be making a thousand bajillion dollars. That plane just does not crash even with hundreds of rounds of ammo flying inside it and even a bomb going off inside it... hehe.

2. I won't ruin the ending, but there was something going on that made me think, ""Well if that happened, then this SHOULD happen"". Which I didn't think would since it's a 'nothing makes sense' movie. But then it DID happen. And when it did, it had to be one of THE best parts of the movie. I thought it was filmed very well and looked very cool. Especially when you saw the shot from behind and a town off in the distance.",1207785600,6,4064,4.367724867724868

Personally, I don't like zombie movies, so I don't even know why I chose to watch this thing, but watch it I did, and was very pleasantly surprised.  Okay, it was silly and obviously done on a low budget, but my standard for films like this is simple: Does it deliver what you expect when you choose to view it and this one clearly does.  It does not take itself seriously and it makes no attempt to be great filmmaking.  This is just a fun hour and a half where a viewer can enjoy some mindless bloodletting.  In fact, as I watched this one I was thinking this might be one of the great films of all time.  I say, watch it and enjoy it.  I rented it and now I'm going to buy it.  What can I say?

2910379,4,B000TUDIL4,"Don't go into Flight of the Living Dead expecting a George Romero zombie movie. The title of the movie alone should tell you what you are in store for. Flight of the Living Dead is simply meant to entertain and in my opinion it very much delivers on that. Believe it or not Flight of the Living Dead was in development prior to the release of Snakes on a Plane, but that movie got the attention and seemed to gain cult status before filming even started, but despite all the hype it only made about a 1-million dollar profit, but despite Flight of the Living Dead being done first, Snakes on a Plane was released first and due to that most will see this as a knock off. And let's face it even if this was first it was Snakes on a Plane that helped get this movie put out under New Line.

I'm a big fan of zombie flicks even some of the weaker ones I tend to enjoy. This one though I wasn't sure what to expect based on the trailer and the plot it seemed like a movie that I would either love or hate, but as a fan of zombie flicks I just had to check it out. Flight of the Living Dead isn't going to go down as one of the greatest zombie movies ever made, but for me it's easily one of the most fun zombie flicks I have ever seen.

The screenplay was written by Sidney Iwanter, Mark Onspaugh & Scott Thomas and I have to say it was actually well written. I didn't expect much from the script, but it was well-done. Sometimes when making a movie like this all those involved take it too serious, but these guys didn't do that. The characters are mostly well written for and are very entertaining, while some are annoying, but they were meant to be. Ok so maybe none of the characters will go down as these Iconic horror movie characters, but they were very entertaining.

Director Scott Thomas does a solid job at keeping the pace going strong. Not much happens in the first 30-minutes, but it's still entertaining due to the characters, which are a lot of fun. Scott Thomas is making a B-movie and always keeps it at that level and keeps the movie fun. Though after the first 30-minutes things do begin to slow down as we await the zombies to attack; there are some quick action scenes that help keep the pacing going. But once the 50-minute mark hits it's all out excitement.

Flight of the Living Dead was simply just a blast; no it's not one of the all time greats, but it was a lot more fun than maybe it should have been. The zombies' attacking the passengers was just full of excitement. Scott Thomas never tries to make it serious he keeps it fun and entertaining. The highlight is when one zombie is killed with an umbrella. My favorite moment is when one zombie bites one of the characters, but she has no teeth and he says she's gumming me to death. It's moments like that is why I enjoyed Flight of the Living Dead so much. It's just one of those movies that you can sit back and just have fun.

As I said the characters were entertaining and believe it or not the acting was actually pretty good for the most part. The actors put in the performance they were meant to. The scenes with Truman played by David Chisum and Frank played by Kevin J. O'Connor were a blast and Kevin J. O'Connor steals the show. His character was hysterical and elevates every scene he's in.

My only real complaint with Flight of the Living Dead was the use of CGI; I'm not the biggest fan of CG in general. While I can sort of tolerate it in a good movie I still prefer the old school way of filmmaking. But in horror flicks I have very little tolerance for CGI I just don't think it works well. Maybe because I'm from an era of Tom Savini and Giannetto De Rossi, but I can count on one hand how many horror flicks with CGI that worked. The CGI wasn't bad for the most part, actually I think the CGI looked better here than most horror flicks, but there were a few instances where it didn't work and looked really terrible.

Overall I though Flight of the Living Dead was excellent; the first half is solid, but does start to drag a little bit, but it's all worth it once the action kicks in. Once the action does start it never lets up and is very fun. The characters were entertaining and I think this movie really works well as just a fun ride. Don't go in expecting a George Romero zombie movie just take the movie for what it's worth and you should enjoy yourself. I had a lot of fun watching Flight of the Living Dead; it's a B-movie and never tries to be more than that and that is a good thing.",1201824000,6,4492,4.210220673635308
2910380,5,B000TUDIL4,"I was prepared to hate this, I really was!  Return of the dead movies are some of the craziest most ridiculous movies I've ever seen, and yet I'm oddly drawn to them!  If theres a zombie on the dvd cover, no matter how much I fight, I'm more than likely going to see it.

I was drawn to this one for two reasons:  First of all the reviews.  Return of the dead movies generally get low reviews because of their antiquated storylines, but this movie got some good reviews and so I wanted to see it for myself.  The second thing that attracted me was the different storyline.  People climb on a plane normal human beings but come off zombies!?!? Why didn't I think of that!?!?

I was prepared to hate this like I said, but I didn't.  I loved it.  I actually found myself afraid at points, I even covered my eyes at points.  There was only a few points where the movie faultered.  There are things that can happen on a plane that will bring it down immediately; things such as shooting! Things such as explosions!  These things were happening nearly throughout the movie, and the plane kept flying like there was nothing going on.  The captain was told that something was going on, he was told people had been killed, and he was warned to turn around and land, but he didn't! Everything starts early in the flight mind you! He loses contact with any radio towers and still doesn't turn around!!  What finally brought the plane down was a passenger who just AMAZINGLY was able to fly a 747!!  LMAO, and to that I say YUCK! Oh and the plane shouldnt have been able to come down the way it did, and STAY IN TACT.

Basically the movie just faulters at those points where my common sense takes over, but in spite of those few points I still loved the movie and still give it a five.",1200787200,,1773,4.308157099697885

 There's not much plot to tell when it comes to Flight of the Living Dead. The cover art also tells us everything we need to know. Zombies outbreak on a plane, and we are treated to view this happening in all of its cheesy, camptastic glory. For the 90 minute running length, we are given sore characters, ridicolous amounts of blood, plot holes big enough to throw a few zombies into, no suspense (except for one bathroom surprise), and a nun that should have just stayed put in her seat.

2910386,2,B000TUDIL4,"They could easily have called it ""Snakes on a Plane 2: Retrovirus Ruckus"" and sucked a few more bucks out of this straight-to-circular-file entry. Don't get me wrong, I'm tipping an additional star for some surprisingly witty moments such as when a zombified old lady bites into a passenger's arm; he screams for a few seconds, then looks down and says to another, ""She's gumming me to death"" -- or when an O.J. knockoff plunks a zombie's head clean off with a golf club and it rolls down to a gash in the floor like a hole-in-one.

I know ""Plane Dead"" is supposed to be some cross between ""Dawn of the Dead"" and ""Airplane,"" and I can forgive a few faults, like the fact that halfway through the film the number of passengers seems to double or even triple. But ""Plane Dead's"" mistakes are flaunted like glittering badges: wooden acting, plot holes a'plenty (for instance, how many times do you think these people could get away with firing their guns inside an airliner without causing everyone to die from asphyxiation? Answer: more than the 100 or so shots were fired here), CGI tomfoolery and money shots of gore by the bucketload.

Toward the end, the whole blood-soaked, digital hunk of junk sags in the sky, then spins out off control.

2910388,4,B000TUDIL4,"Flight of the Living Dead is one of those movies that are fun, unbelievable, and a great way to waste 90 minutes. The title says it all but in case you couldn't guess the movie begins with an odd cast of characters on their way to Paris. One of the passengers is an infected scientist kept in cryogenics, but when turbulence hits the plane, she escapes, and soon there is a zombie plague on a jet. The next 90 minutes are full of blood, mayhem, and more abuse than any plane could actually take without breaking apart. Not only are hundreds of bullets shot through the plane, a bomb detonates on board and the plane still keeps on going. That plane harder to kill than John McClain in a Die Hard movie!

But the indestructible plane aside, this is a great movie. It's it 90 minutes of undead fun. I don't think it could actually scare anyone (unless you had a pathological phobia of zombies like some people I know) but it can provide lots of entertainment. The special effects aren't bad, and are better than a lot of direct to DVD movies, and even some that made it into the theater. When someone is shot in the head, you can actually see through their head for example, and the sprays of blood are gory and cool. Bravo to the special effects team. The script leaves something to be desired, but saying you watch a movie like this for the scripting or acting is like saying you read Playboy for the articles...

All in all I would highly recommend this film for anyone interested in relaxing and not thinking for 90 minutes, or someone who just wants a bit of zombie escapism. You will not be disappointed in this purchase.

It's low budget, but not no budget like most of the zombie movies that wind up in my dvd player. So that right there was a surpise. The story was pretty much like a scifi original, so at the start I became worried about how the rest of the movie would turn out.

Luckily, once the zombies made their outbreak on this plane, they did not hold back like a scifi original might have. This movie was wonderfully gory, with dozens of zombies tearing people apart all over the plane. There weren't any outstanding moments of horror history as far as the different deaths went, but it was all very satisfying.

By the end of the movie there was just nothing but pure excitement and zombie mayhem. This is what a zombie movie should be, and I was about ten times happier because I was not expecting this at all.

FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD: OUTBREAK ON A PLANE, as awful as it sounds, really is a must-see for zombie movie fans, at least as long as you're not some rabid Romero fanboy who thinks these movies have to have meaning and social commentary and all sorts of unnecessary things like that.

2910391,2,B000TUDIL4,"If goofy characters, bad dialogue, and plenty of Playstation 2 quality CGI effects sound like a fun way to blow an hour and a half (and you aren't already playing Playstation 2) then Flight Of The Living Dead may just be up your alley... but you could still do better I promise (maybe play some Playstation 2?).  Imagine taking elements of House Of The Dead, Top Gun, and of course, Snakes On A Plane, mixing them all together and then getting your favorite Soap Opera stars together to adlib dialogue to the ""script"" (maybe a page long... maybe?) and you get a glimpse (basically the whole picture) at what you're in store for.  A few decent scenes of gore, some pretty cool and menacing zombies, and a few laughs (mostly unintentional) keep this from being completely unwatchable but... this movie actually features a scene where a flight attendent asks the ""hero"" why he's doing what he's doing, to which he replies, ""because I made a promise once... to someone special.""  And that's it, just puts that out there without any previous explanation or exposition afterwards to just what this promise is or to who it was for?!  Another scene has another ""hero"" shoot a zombie 3 times then calmly state, ""2 in the chest and 1 in the balls... that's how I do it.""  Which isn't only funny because it's so badly written but also because (as we Horror fans know) that won't even kill a zombie (and you just wasted 3 bullets @ss)!  So ultimately the best thing going for Flight Of The Living Dead is... uh, hmmmm, I guess the semi-clever play on the Night Of The Living Dead title?  Unless you're a complete zombie enthusiast that watches everthing and anything featuring walking corpses that feast on the living... skip this and throw any number of much better undead films into your DVD player (seen Planet Terror yet?).",1195344000,,1815,4.653125
2910392,5,B000TUDIL4,"I absolutely freakin' love this movie.  My best zombie-loving bud only gave it two stars, but it's five stars all the way from this reviewer.  It has pretty much everything I want in a zombie film: zombies running absolutely amuck (no wasting time staggering around waiting for a victim to come their way), plenty of blood and gore, great special effects, some well-timed hilarity, and an assortment of hot chicks.  Put a check by each line in the zombie flight summary of Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane (also known as Plane Dead).  And don't go chanting Snakes on a Plane rip-off at me because the concept of this film reportedly predated that of Snakes on a Plane and, more importantly, this is a much more entertaining movie.  Let's face it; if there's anything harder to deal with than snakes on a plane, it would have to be a quickly multiplying number of vicious zombies on a plane.  Even first-class ticket holders can forget all the niceties when carnivorous cadavers come to play.

Those wacky scientists have been at it again, putting together some kind of malaria virus (which is particularly impressive given the fact that malaria is not caused by a virus at all) that, well, basically kills you in a couple of heartbeats and then brings you back to life.  It's just the thing for the military, guaranteeing that you can't keep a Marine down, not even a dead one - and it's also useful for infecting and killing the enemy, as well.  It seems that the government isn't too high on the idea, though, and that's why the project's two scientists and project manager leaving the country on board a 747 en route to Paris - along with the freeze dried wife of one scientist and an armed guard to watch over the precious cargo down in the hold.  Unfortunately, the flight plan takes the plane through a gargantuan thunder storm.  Things shift around, containment is breached, and the special cargo wakes up and goes all zombified.

Obviously, Boeing hasn't built the cargo hold that can keep a flesh-craving zombie from breaking out, and it doesn't help that the scientists and the co-pilot go down there to look around.  Thanks to their fresh bodies, the virus spreads quickly, pretty much ruining the flight for all of the stereotypical characters.  Mile High Club activities are curtailed, to say the least, when zombies start bursting through the walls and floors.  Not even a praying nun is safe as the zombie rampage spreads like wildfire - I'm telling you, these zombies don't mess around, and everyone they kill quickly joins the murderous zombie minions.  For the viewer, bloody zombie hilarity quickly ensues, most of it courtesy of the film's least likely of heroes.

There's blood aplenty, but the hardcore zombie fan might be disappointed by the lack of viscera amidst all of the feeding scenes - this isn't Dawn of the Dead, by any means.  Still, I have to say that the special effects were, for the most part, exceedingly well done - certainly far more impressive than you'll find in the lion's share of straight-to-DVD releases.  That being said, this movie won't provide many scares to anyone over the age of 12, despite the fact that the zombies scream a lot when they aren't gorging their bloody faces and bodies with fresh human meat, and the only suspense I felt involved my concern that the hottest babes would be killed off too soon for my liking -- but that doesn't stop Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plan from zooming up the charts of my favorite zombie films.  I for one was immensely entertained throughout, and there's one hilarious moment toward the end that I will remember fondly for the rest of my days.  It's a shame this movie was denied a theatrical release, as I think it would have certainly broken even at the box office.  If you ask me, this is easily the most entertaining zombie film since Shaun of the Dead.",1195344000,,3880,4.675

2910395,4,B000TUDIL4,"FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD:  OUTBREAK ON A PLANE is a direct-to-DVD release that exists independently of George Romaro and John Russo's zombie franchises that started out sharing the same grave.  So to speak.  Their NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is an iconic zombie film that started the whole trend of the horror subgenre and created international fans.

Scott Thomas has done a lot of episodic television and low-budget films, and he has the right sensitivity - if you can be sensitive about zombies - to this kind of film.  In addition to directing the movie, Thomas also helped write it with Sidney Iwanter and Mark Onspaugh.

There are no stars in this feature, but there are some guys who've been around the block.  David Chisum plays Special Agent Truman Burroughs, one of the good guys.  You might know him from the television soap, ONE LIFE TO LIVE.

Richard Tyson plays US Air Marshal Paul Judd.  Tyson has been a major player at times in big movies, such as the villain in Schwarzenegger's KINDERGARTEN COP.

Neither one of our heroes is really outstanding.  But they don't have to be.  It's zombies on an airplane!

I showed the DVD to my 10-year-old, who hasn't become a zombie fan yet, though he did watch DAWN OF THE DEAD (the remake) with me recently.  Then he spent the night in bed with me and his mom.  Zombies have to be acclimated to slowly, I think.

But his first comment was, ""On a plane, huh?  They're not going to get away, are they?  There's nowhere to run.""

And that, my friends, was probably the pitch line used by the movie developers.  Honestly, it was enough to get me to the screen and start watching zombies crawling through the big Concord jet.  You really won't believe how many zombies can be put on one of those big jets!

The plot is simple.  All zombie movie plots are simple.  After a cast of characters are introduced - most of them not so likeable because they're interested in sex or drugs or just being mean to each other, and a few of them that are decent people that we'll root for and lose most of - something sets the zombies into action.

In FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD:  OUTBREAK ON A PLANE, we have mad scientists fleeing the US government after being found out.  The scientists, headed by Dr. Leo Bennett (Erick Avari), have discovered a way to genetically alter humans so that after they die they ""come back to life.""  The research was initially there to be a bio-weapon that was going to be used on soldiers.  If soldiers were killed, they could re-animate and fight on.  After they turned out to be mindless brutes capable of spreading contagion, it was decided that the military could infect prisoners and let them return to the enemy armies to spread the ""disease.""

Unfortunately, one of the scientists' wives was exposed to the biological contaminant.  She's been placed in suspended animation and kept on ice till they can cure her.  However, the flight hits a freak storm and the containment unit is compromised.  She's released, killed by the guard posted in the cargo area, then reanimates as a flesh-eating zombie.

That's the plot.  After that, the special effects crews have a blast and the body count skyrockets.

Zombie fans will probably have a blast playing ancillary games while watching the movie.  Stuff like, picking the first to die.  Picking those who will survive.  Counting bullets to see whose gun should be empty.  Thinking up excuses why - after it's Swiss cheesed by bullets - the plane doesn't decompress until a CRITICAL moment in the movie when the plot needs that to happen.

Cheesy as the movie is, it doesn't stint on gore or action.  People die in gruesome ways.  Sex is hinted at.  Bodies reanimate when the heroes have their backs to them and no matter how loudly you yell at the television, they're not going to hear you.

I was surprised, even though the acting was lackadaisical and there wasn't even any real one-liners that stuck in my memory, how keyed up I got over the movie.  I knew my emotions were being toyed with.  But I didn't care.  I put aside my movie critic hat and plunged into the childish delight of a zombie lover.

By the end of the movie, there were so many zombies crawling around the plane it looked like an anthill.  I wasn't anxious about it even though there were a few surprises (I would have blown the ""who's gonna die next"" competition, and I would have even lost a few on the ""who's gonna live"" list).

Although FLIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD:  OUTBREAK ON A PLANE isn't going to win any drama awards, and not even any in horror, it's a fun watch for zombie fans.  At an hour and a half, it's just the right length to send out for a pizza, take a few shots at the plot and characters, and adlib some insane lines that should have been in the movie.  Horror fans who love a touch of comedy and don't mind some deliberate willing-suspension-of-disbelief should have a grand time with this one.",1194912000,51,4904,4.548054919908467
2910396,3,B000TUDIL4,"Well it would be easy to expect this to be a prime turkey but it turned out to be more fun that I was expecting. Central plot...well the title says it all. Now it all depends on the skill of the director in what turned out here, as rampaging zombies on the confines of a passenger aircraft sounds like horror movie gold on paper, and it would take a serious dope to mess up what is essentially a very simple idea for a fun horror film. And for the most part things flow along pretty well...but you will have to swallow some of the biggest doses of unreality ever seen in a horror movie. Worst of all is the cliche ridden array of passengers we have here. Squabbling teen couples, a policeman and his prisoner charge, cuffed together, scientists who try to hush up the deadly zombie outbreak because it was their fault that it was on board, four or five sexy stewardesses with mini skirts and stilettoes, celebrity golf pro and pouty wife, even the obligatory nun ( I kid you not). Although there are no whiney kids on board, thank god.
Anyway, as I said the film plays with it's core material very well, and for a while the outbreak of zombie mayhem is quite high octane excitement, as slobbering ghouls run up and down the aisles, biting screaming passengers and generally flinging bodies all over the place. Inevitably, it proves impossible to maintain such a level of excitement for very long, I mean it's just the one normal sized plane (not some impossibly large movie location type plane that stretches on forever I'm pleased to report) so things have to go somewhere pretty swiftly. There's only so long you can avoid a mob of zombies on a plane in midflight! Some of the best parts of the outbreak involves the zombies taking over the luggage hold, and they break through the ceiling to the passenger cabin above, and start pulling unlucky victims to their deaths through a large hole in the floor! This lower cargo area, with it's sickly yellow lighting and cramped space, could have(in the hands of a more skilled director) been transformed into a real vison of hell as the zombies fill it with writhing victims and severed body parts, but as things stand, its only shown in a few throwaway shots of dead bodies or people being gnawed to death. I'd like to have seen this territory battle developed further in the film, but it wasn't expanded on much.
Anyway, the effects aren't bad although there's way too much CGI, and when this is over-relied on, it shows. One very early shot has a female zombie being shot, and in an effect that redefines the term ""lame"", the impact effects of the bullets hitting her are CGI'd onto her blouse, which looks dreadful. Luckily things don't remain this bad, but don't expect any spectacular gore efects. Apart from blood being constantly sprayed about, there are very few gore set pieces, and the zombie make-up consists only of yellow contact lenses and a rather pink veiny face, so the infected hordes are more like the crazies from ""28 Days Later"" than traditional zombies. A few good scenes stand out, like and early attack through the wall of a toilet cubicle which is when the main infection really starts to spread, and a cool zombie death involving an umbrella (shades of Peter Jackson's ""Braindead"" leap to mind here). But a lot of this fun sinks under the weight of so many mind-boggling plot impossibilities...guns are all over the place and zombies are shot with wild abandon, with no rupturing of a single window or external wall. Also, people STILL seem to use the old standby of NEVER shooting a zombie in the face...it must be because gunshot wounds to the body are much cheaper to shoot as special effects. Not good enough! Plus, in a scene that had my friends and I gasping in disbelief, one of the more heroic characters knocks up a makeshift BOMB (how???) and throws it (ignited) into the luggage hold. ""It should act as a distraction"" he explains. Yeah, in the same way that the entire plane ripping in two might do! But lo and behold, a few zombies are blown to bits but not a single panel on the walls of the plane gets damaged. There are plenty more things like this going on, and someone actually has the cheek to use the immortal line: ""Does anybody know how to fly a plane?"" With a straight face!

Well if you can put up with all the crazy nonsense of the plot, the film is actually quite a fun rollercoaster ride. The acting's not bad, although no-one has anything approaching a developed personailty, and the plane makes for a good, claustrophobic setting even if it is suspicously under-filled, and has those only-in-the-movies man-sized ventilation shafts that you can crawl through and pop out in all sorts of places. So forgive all that, and you could have a good laugh watching this.",1194825600,16,4764,4.598119858989424
2910397,4,B000TUDIL4,"Zombies, you are cleared for landing...

1) ACTING: The acting was very good in this movie. Everyone made their roles believable. Even though some stereotypical characters were present, there were no problems.

2) PRODUCTION: The production values of this movie were very good. Scenes were properly lit, no weird camera angles, special effects were good and there was plenty of blood and gore. When someone is attacked by a zombie, you see the rips and tears and teeth marks on the victims. You see the wound where the blood is coming from, not just ""let's throw blood on an actor and say they've been wounded."" Nice normal soundtrack as well.

3) ZOMBIES: The zombies here would be ""Snyder Runners,"" not that there is really anywhere to run on a jet, but they are very violent and aggressive. The zombie make up consisted of creepy eye contacts and a mouth full of blood. More than a few times, the viewer sees the zombies ""licking their chops."" There is no sign of the zombies remembering when they were alive, and no type of communication other than a cobra-like hiss.

4) THE CAUSE: Man made virus spread by mosquitos.

5) NUDITY: None.

This movie was just a fun little romp into zombieland. For a ""B"" movie, it was pretty good. I really think this should have been released to theaters. While there is nothing new here (zombie-wise) that hasn't been seen before, having a jet full of zombies was a good idea, as literally, there is nowhere to run and escape or hide. If you are looking for something out of the ordinary or new when it comes to zombie movies, you won't find it here. This is just another solid, entertaining entry into the ""living dead"" movie genre.

RATING: 4 out of 5",1194566400,8,1691,4.598006644518272
2910398,4,B000TUDIL4,"Despite the wordplay and similarity to Snakes on a Plane, Flight of the Living Dead: Outbreak on a Plane is an effective and amusing zombie film. In interviews, director and co-writer Scott Thomas says that his original treatment called ""Plane Dead"" was done before Snakes on a Plane but who cares. I had fun at this anti-Romero zombie flick that stressed action, witty dialog, and fun characters. On a transatlantic flight to France, an airliner carries a deadly cargo...a genetic experiment into a replicating virus that can cause dead limbs...and bodies to reanimate. The military is searching for the rogue scientists who have brought the cargo aboard the plane. Dr. Bennett (Erick Avari) leads the team and is only two willing to send his colleagues down below to check on their freight when the co-pilot informs them of a malfunction in the cargo bay. The cargo was another one of their colleagues who has been infected by the virus and is now free. It's not long before the quick acting virus causes the zombies to multiply exponentially and soon the passengers are scrambling to try and get away from the undead hordes.

These are not the Romero, slow moving shamblers but more like the infected in ""28 Days Later', fast and strong and hungry! Among the passengers is the always enjoyable character actor Kevin J. O' Connor (The Mummy, Lord of Illusions) as con-man Frank Strathmore handcuffed to a cop, Truman Burrows, (David Chisum) who is returning him to Europe to stand trial. The wise-cracking O'Connor delivers some of the best lines in the film and gives the film a welcomed dose of black humor. Richard Tyson plays unlikely air marshal Paul Judd. You might recall Tyson is his first role as bully Buddy Revell in the 80's cult film ""Three O' Clock High"". Judd teams with Burrows, O'Connor, and pro golfer William Freeman to try and keep the Zombies at bay so the plane can be safely landed. You just new that Freeman's putter would make a great weapon when you saw him polishing it early on.

These are not household names but they are faces you recognize and are certainly very experienced performers, which lifts Flight of the Living Dead well above typical low-budget zombie fare. The action is ridiculously over-the-top as zombies literally burst through the floor in the passenger area and claw their way out of the cargo hold. Is this plane made of Styrofoam or what? It's extremely bloody as all the zombies go right for the throat but it's not overly gory. This is just a unique setting for a zombie film as they are typically played over broad expanses...here, in this airplane, there are not many places to hide and that makes it that much more terrifying.

There are a few impossibilities if you want to nitpick...at one point, a couple who have been bitten would rather open the door to the plane and get sucked out rather than getting eaten alive. I'm not expert on jets but I think it's supposed to be pretty impossible to open those doors in the air unless you're the Hulk. And it's a little hard to believe, given our security in light of terrorist attacks that this cargo would get aboard the airplane so easily.

Flight of the Living Dead is a great diversion. The performances are very good (especially O'Connor's), it's very good from a technical standpoint...light, sound, camera work, and it's got some of the most clever writing in a horror film since Shaun of the Dead.

2910401,2,B000TUDIL4,"A mosquito has been found in the Amazon that has some interesting qualities. Amongst those is the fact that it dies and then comes back to life briefly, giving it something of an undead ""boomph."" Enter a nice little medical facility wanting to take advantage of that, a government that doesn't quite appreciate the applications they've talked about, and a little package fit snug in the cargo hold of a plane.
Yeah, anything that requires a man with a submachine gun to watch over it might be a tad bit bad. Still, nobody seems the wiser until ""bad things"" start happening.

Just by looking at the title, you know this isn't going to be a high budget outing. The cover art furthers that, and then the casting calls scream ""B."" I personally like cheaper movies, finding many of them funny, and some of this movie got a laugh out of me. The generic characters, the plane that wouldn't fly in the real world, the military reaction to the zombie problem; everything inside the package could have made for a really good movie and kept me laughing. COULD is an operative word, however, and watching the movie made me wonder why ends have to drone on and on and on.
Headshots here, a few taps in the chest there - the movie could have used a makeover that lessened it by about twenty minutes.

If you really need a zombie fix and have exhausted everything from the now until the 80s, then you could go here. It wasn't unwatchable and, for a while, I laughed somewhat. I just wanted more and thought the delivery was slooow. I also expected more gore; cheap can be redeemed by the horrific if it is done decently. Instead of that, there were a lot of neck bites, reminding me of a montage of vampire movies and not zombies on the warpath.

The action was good and the dead looked authentic.  Even though the action started almost from the beginning, considering the cast,this could have been a better movie had the writers decided to delve deeper into the secret weapon on board/prisoner-cop-waitress interplay, boyfriends-girlfriends and bathrooms stories and postponed the living-dead until after mid-way through the movie.

Just do not expect a Romero or even a 28 days but better than other Zombie flicks. It has a ok plot with a virus that reanimates the dead. Why it on a commercial flight I have no answer. This plot has many holes like that. Plus the storm that releases the carrier of the virus and the typical cast on the flight. You have the con being transported the young couple doing it the bathroom. A sports celeberity and so on. The acting is better than average and the gore is pretty good.

2910406,4,B000TUDIL4,"I thought this film was fun and I recomend it to all zombie fans. As the title of this review states , this film fits pritty good into ""Return of the living dead"" , or at least part 3 on because the zombie's eat people in this one and don't crave ""BRAINS!"" .
The film starts out like any other air plain crisis movie with a intro of charactors that are your commen stereo-types : ""the U.S. marshel"" , ""the criminal"" , ""the flight attendents"" , ""the pilots"" , and because it's a horror film ... ""good looking horny young 20 somthings"" , ""the millitary looking to shoot down the zombie infested plain who could have stoped the plain before it even took off and some how knew about the scientest before the killing even started (just like in ""Return""), and ""the scientest"" ..... and then the killing starts .
The film isn't that gory though (mostly blood) and for some reason the director paned the camera away from some of the kills .
As for the acting , Good and the film has a good cast of well known charactor actors and you'll go ""Hey , I saw that gut in th mummy and that gut too ! , And isn't that the daughter in Leathal weapon 2 ? , and I sware I've seen that guy some whare!""

2910409,4,B000TUDIL4,"This movie was recommended to me from a buddy and I went in thinking ""zombies on a plane??"" only to find out this was actually made BEFORE Snakes on a Plane so I shrugged it off and watched the movie. It's great! It starts somewhat slow but after about 26 minutes or so the virus is released from its container and all hell breaks loose. Once the action starts it doesn't stop, for the next hour is blood, guts and guns. What I really liked was the fact that Richard Tyson (Buddy Rivell from the 80's teen flock 3 O' Clock High) is in it in a starring role. The CGI like what some other people said, is kinda bad in some areas, the plane looks pretty fake but it's not THAT bad I guess. The zombies themselves are amazingly well done for being a low budget direct to DVD movie, the makeup is outstanding. Some of the blood splatter looks kinda fake but it's not that big of a deal.

As far as the gun issue, the guys with guns were TSA Agents and a federal marshall transporting a prisoner, so it's believable. What's not believable are the fact that their shooting inside the plane and none of the bullets do damage to the interior of the plane, no windows shot out or anything, so it's kinda off in that aspect. Overall though I HIGHLY recommend this movie as a great popcorn flick to watch with your friends, rent it before you buy it though, some people might not like this, while I think most would like it.",1191974400,2,1412,4.24907063197026

I guess the next movie will take place on a cruise ship (jump overboard) or perhaps on a manned spaceship (there's no escape in space).",1443571200,,256,4.244897959183674
