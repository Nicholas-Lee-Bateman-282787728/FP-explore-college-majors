5966679,4,B00F3OLVHY,"Sanitarium was a movie I was pretty hyped for. Mostly because I can easily get hyped. I've enjoyed a number of the anthology films that have been springing up the past couple of years (V/H/S, V/H/S 2, ABC's of Death, Chillerama) because even there are a few clunkers, there are always a good amount that grab my attention with awesome stories, satisfying gore, and everything a fun horror movie usually has. So an anthology film with Malcolm McDowell's name plastered on it would of course get a day one buy for me.

Now if your expecting a horror movie where it all lays in the actual sanitarium/asylum with a bunch of scares, gore, and sleaziness, this is not your film (trust me cause that's what I was kind of hoping for too). What I got instead was something I haven't had a lot in modern horror films. To be honest, I don't know if I should call it a horror film (even though the DVD cover implies it to be). This film falls more into the psychological thriller category for me.

It contains three ""origin"" stories of how three very different people ended up in the sanitarium that the character McDowell resides in.

The first story is about an artist who, on the brink of success, begins to hear his own creation talk to him, convincing him, his friends are out to destroy his creations who he loves very much. It was a good start and I enjoyed the ending.

The second story involves a very shy child who begins to see a man in black follow him around while he struggles to cope with his abusive father, all while his teacher begins to suspect of the crimes being committed as the child's home. A story that comes up with a very ambiguous ending. Very well done as well.

The third story is the best of them all and stars an actor I wish to get familiar with after seeing this. Lou Diamond Phillips plays a college professor that beings to become obsess with the Mayan predictions of the end of the world. In this tale, you see a man go deep into depression and insanity from being alone for an extraordinary amount of time. All while figuring out what he did to get himself in the situation he was in. I was amazed at this story, and if anything, THIS is the reason to watch the movie. If not watch the whole thing, just watch this. Very claustrophobic, and an incredible performance by Lou Diamond Phillips!

Now onto the cons of this. For one, the dvd comes with no special features at all. So anyone who is into that kind of stuff would not be so happy to have a barebones package.

Another problem is that this movie is an hour and about fifty minutes. That's a long time for a film, and it can be a bit slow at times. I feel like the first two could have been cut of sometime (five minutes each maybe?) and it still would've been effective. I can't say what else but the length of this film can be a negative for people who don't like slow burning movies.

In the end, I'm happy with the purchase! Great movie to add to my collection.",1388534400,6,2948,4.327898550724638

the real horror it's not the doctors BUT the PATIENTS you have to be so mentally afraid of. Forget all the CRAZY PEOPLE in society it's the patients you must be afraid of in this classic movie about the real horrors that go on in these secret behind locked doors..",1381276800,3,451,4.380952380952381

5966687,5,B00F3OLVHY,"Sanitarium is an excellent mind thriller, it invites one to examine that the mind is often a scary place to live. The viewer is treated to three different story lines all with the psychological  mental link connecting all three.  The high rating is in part, due to the viewer being left to draw their own conclusions about the characters in all three story lines. Sanitarium stirs up questions among its
viewers that makes for great discussions which is always an extra bonus to movie viewers. Sanitarium takes you thru the insanity of its different characters slowly unfolding the lives they live.
Convincing acting and good directing make this movie a must see.",1398038400,,663,4.910714285714286
5966688,1,B00F3OLVHY,"not worth watching so I shut it off half way through the first segment very boring and weird, not scary",1397865600,,103,4.2
5966689,3,B00F3OLVHY,"With a cast featuring Malcolm McDowell, Lou Diamond Phillips, Robert Englund and Lacey Chabert, I was hoping for a bit more than what I got with Sanitarium.  The first story is creepy enough and probably the best.  The second, which features the always lovely Ms. Chabert, is unfortunately not terribly scary.  The final, a virtual one-man show for Lou Diamond Phillips, is worth watching for his acting, but doesn't really pay off in the end.  None of the three stories is bad, but each one could have been a lot better.",1395446400,2,521,4.6923076923076925
5966690,3,B00F3OLVHY,"The first story was kind of interesting, but the other were so-so...it definitely was not scary, which was disappointing.  From what I was reading on the rating I thought I would need to have the lights on, but...alas...no.  I do not recommend this unless want a slow so-so weird horror film.",1394582400,,292,4.705882352941177
5966691,5,B00F3OLVHY,I thoroughly enjoyed it! I got to watch part of this movie being made and was surprised how well done it is. Great movie at a great price.,1393545600,3,138,3.9642857142857144
5966692,5,B00F3OLVHY,"This movie tells 3 different stories of patients in the sanitarium. Each one unique in their own way with a few twists and turns of each. This is a high quality film with amazing actors, awesome directing, and phenomenal writing. I would recommend this movie to anyone and everyone :)",1391299200,2,284,4.7
5966693,2,B00F3OLVHY,"Sanitarium is an anthology consisting of three stories of patients in an unnamed sanitarium, tied together by the onscreen narration by Malcolm McDowell who plays Dr. Stenson.  The first tale features John Glover as a sculptor who is being drugged with hallucinogenics by his assistant in hope of getting him to sell his work.  The drugs make Gustav think his clay sculptures are talking to himand they are telling him to kill.

The second story tells the tale of a young man who was abused by his father as a child and conjures up a monster from his imagination to help him.  In the final segment, Lou Diamond Phillips is a professor obsessed with the 2012 Mayan Apocalypse theory.  He builds a bunker to survive the disaster but at what turns out to be a terrible cost.

Sanitarium features a solid cast that also includes Robert Englund and Lacey Chabert but the stories are just not that interesting.  They are stories that have been told before and offer nothing new. Most disappointing is that the wraparound story with McDowell goes nowhere.  Hes simply a doctor relating case histories and the script gives him little to do.  The second story clouds the line between schizophrenia and the supernatural and its conclusion is left vague.  While theres certainly performances here to enjoy the entire package is lackluster.",1390608000,2,1328,4.862222222222222
5966694,2,B00F3OLVHY,Either I'm crazy or I just don't understand crazy. I only enjoyed the first story of this trilogy. The second made no sense at all and the third was just wack. The cover makes it look interesting but it's not. Don't wast your money.,1390089600,,232,4.295454545454546

5966696,3,B00F3OLVHY,"This is a collection of three stories done ""Creepshow"" style with Malcolm McDowell as the narrator.

The first episode involves an artist with a creepy doll menagerie. It had the right length and a good ""Creepshow"" style twist to it. Unfortunately the other two tales didn't met the quality of the first one. The second tale involve an introverted boy who is followed around by a demon...he is also being molested by his father, a theme that has been beat to death recently in the horror genre.

The third episode has Lou Diamond Phillips as a professor who is obsessed with the end of the world and the Mayan calender as he believes aliens are about to return so he builds a shelter in his back yard.

Things went down hill real fast after the first episode. Might do as a Redbox rental.
