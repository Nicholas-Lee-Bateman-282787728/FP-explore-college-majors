3630466,5,B001HL06H8,"I purchased this item maybe a month ago, and I was very excited to find this prize online, in stock and for sale at such a great deal!! Seriously, I looked on ebay for weeks, and watched auctions of USED collections go for MORE than this package is selling for BRAND NEW on Amazon.com!
I recieved my Heroes Seasons 1 & 2 on blu-ray maybe a week or two later (I'm not exactly sure when it was delivered since I didn't check my post office box right away!) They were in pristine condition (brand new and not damaged, and I was super excited to get them home for viewing. The quality is amazing and the picture and effect is nothing less of what I have come to expect from Blu-Ray and and HD t.v. You can buy this on ebay like I said for an arm and a leg, and still only get 1 season of the show for the price you'll pay here, for a used copy, with someone else's ware and tear on it already! Thats a let down! During Christmas shopping yesterday at BestBuy I priced the two seasons on blu-ray, brand new for $140.00!!! A ridiculous price when you can buy here on Amazon for the price they're selling season 1 for, alone!! This is a long review, but I had a lot to say, and its all true! I am a fanatic of the show, but I had to give Amazon its due respect for being such a great site to do business with! If you are a Heroes fan, or are looking to buy for one, BUY HERE and BUY NOW, because seriously, the prices won't last, and its a helluva deal. Shipping was even FREE!
Amazon has NEVER let me down with any of my purchases, and I am always a happy and satisfied customer when I receive my items I buy. I have come to expect a level of professionalism and quality from the site, and it always delivers and never lets me down. The sellers that sell on here that I have dealt with are always honorable and reputable as well. These are all very important qualities you want to look for when your buying online.",1229990400,2,1908,4.0906666666666665
3630467,5,B001HL06H8,the other poster is obviously bad at math.  the first season is over $60. then the prices increases...  excellent price,1224979200,,119,4.9
3630468,3,B001HL06H8,"I just received this ""Heroes"" collection~~ at $59 for season 1 AND 2, thought that was an excellent price, and, never seeing ANY episodes what so ever, once I read some reviews,I ordered,and was ready to enjoy it....Well, I am shocked at the quality of the high def ""shadow area's"" in the very first episode...it is distracting, to say the least~~the dark area is, how should I say, TOO DARK, and ""shadowy""~~~ for instance, in scenes where they are standing in a room, the faces are shadowed TOO much , to the point where you can't almost see them....Light area's are fine... First , let me say, it cannot not be my equipment~~I have an over $3000~ calibrated, Sony 52"" XBR5, Sony PS3, Oynko 7.1 surround home theater, and 40 Blu-Ray movies in my collection, and this is the FIRST Blu-Ray to look like this~~ I even played another one{Planet~Earth} to make sure I wasn't ""seeing things""... could I have gotten a ""lemon""? I'm thinking that now, simply after coming back in this ""review area"", I see no one else has mentioned it, and how could you not notice? It is basically on my mind all the way though it {only seen the first disc}...I believe I will be sending it back, even at that price, I am not ""living with it""... I realize, not all Blu-Ray look ""100%""~~ Some are ""crystal~clear"", while others are ""so~so"". The acceptable standard at which they gage ""High~Def"" is fairly big...some just ""make it"" in at the bottom, so to speak, while others ""exceed"" average.....but this issue is not right.... Jus thought I'd throw my peticular findings in here, thanks for listening !!",1243555200,2,1578,4.659498207885305
3630469,5,B001HL06H8,"I was excited to see that Amazon was offering such a fantastic deal on seasons 1 & 2 of Heroes.  I love this show, and I am particularly pleased that the writers have maintained such a high level of writing episode after episode.  Although it is unfortunate that the writer's strike cut season 2 short, it still was packed with extremely good story lines and interesting new characters.",1236038400,,386,4.661764705882353
3630470,5,B001HL06H8,I waited to see Heroes in the Bluray format and it was worth the wait. Fantastic!!,1235088000,,82,4.1875
3630471,5,B001HL06H8,"I got the first season as a gift for Christmas, and returned it to the store, so I could take advantage of the 2 Season deal here on Amazon!

I avoided the show so long, because I love X-Men, and I thought this was a blatant ripoff of that.

I gave it a try anyway.  I'm really glad I did!  (It turns out, the creator of X-Men, Stan Lee, actually makes a cameo in the show!)

This show is so exciting, and the writing is incredible.  So many twists, and surprises.  I always wanted to watch the next episode.

Now I'm fully addicted and enjoying the 3rd Season so much.  With HD TV shows now, the effects are stunning.

GO HRG!!  (my fave character)",1235088000,,649,4.153225806451613
3630472,4,B001HL06H8,"Considering you get both Heroes Season 1 AND Season 2 for less than what Season 1 costs alone at places like Best Buy makes this an excellent deal. I admit I'm not a fan of many TV series, my big brother made me watch Season 1 and I was hooked. Sadly Season 2 was terrible...but I'm now hooked into the series..so I continue to watch Heroes all the way to the most current episode in Season 3 pt 2.

3630473,5,B001HL06H8,"I've been stationed in Germany for almost three years and I don't have the decoder, so I've missed out on a lot of this series. Lucky for me Amazon had this great deal on the first two seasons. I started watching the first season through digital episodes, and was addicted fromt he very first episode. I had missed a few episodes of season 1, and all of season 2 due to my military commitments, but I've been catching up on the weekends and can't wait for season 3's release on BluRay. My kids (ages 9 & 10) are also hooked on it so I'm going to have to pre-order it.

In ending, this has got to be one my favorite shows (right along with G.I. Joe, Voltron, and Robotech). Great story line, great acting, and my kids love it. I can't wait for season three!!!",1234224000,2,758,4.227586206896552
3630474,5,B001HL06H8,"They took the best show on tv and made the ultimate Blu-ray set.
I totaly love all the extra features and the sound and picture quality was awesome",1232323200,,147,4.285714285714286
3630475,4,B001HL06H8,"Heroes. An awesome show especially the first season. All about seemingly ordinary people learning they have extraordinary abilities. This was the best part about watching the first season. Discovering themselves, as the characters found out what they were capable of. Of course, not all the characters use their special abilities for good, and some are simply misguided. Others however, choose to use their abilities only for personal gain which often means they do harm and evil towards others.

The Second season felt directionless as far as where the show's plot is trying to move. There are a couple of new characters in season two, but all the main established characters from the first season seem to have lost some of their appeal. I guess it's all the extra drama and personal conflict they're going through which the first season mostly lacked.

These shows being Blu-Ray was especially nice. The high def transfer came out looking terrific on my 60"" Sony SXRD 1080p Bravia. I still think Blu-Ray needs to become much cheaper, but at least Amazon offers this bundled season pack at a good discount.

Well, that's my mini review. If you want an ""in depth"" review of Heroes, I'd recommend going to  [...]",1231632000,3,1211,4.921568627450981

3630477,4,B001HL06H8,"What if you discovered that you had a superpower -- great strength, flight, teleportation, or amazing healing? And what if you could use it to save the world?

Superheroes are everywhere in entertainment, from comic books to movies. But they suddenly got new attention in ""Heroes,"" which explores the repercussions of ""ordinary"" people who discover that they have strange -- and sometimes dangerous -- powers. The first season is a a solid comic-book style TV series, although the second season trips over itself.

It opens with Mohinder Suresh (Sendhil Ramamurthy) reflecting on the human quest for knowledge -- even knowledge that we shouldn't have -- right before learning that his father has been killed, possibly murdered. Suresh's dad believed that ""special"" people were cropping up, much like in X-Men.

And we are introduced to the ""heroes"": stripper Niki (Ali Larter) harbors a secret dark side, cheerleader Claire (Hayden Panettiere) heals from any injury, cubicle worker Hiro (Masi Oka) bends time and space, Senatorial candidate Nathan (Adrian Pasdar) is able to fly, his brother Peter (Milo Ventimiglia) can copy others' powers, cop Matt (Greg Grunberg) can read minds, and junkie artist Isaac (Santiago Cabrera) sees the future.

Their lives are dramatically changed by their powers -- some explore them, some are haunted by them, and a superpowered serial killer is hunting and murdering the others. Even worse, Hiro witnesses the explosive destruction of New York a mere five weeks into the future -- and a future version of himself says that saving the cheerleader will save the world.

The second season is a much shorter one (because of a writers' strike) and doesn't quite measure up to the epic heights of the first season. The Heroes are struggling to deal with the aftereffects of the past season, especially the now-alcoholic Nathan and amnesiac Peter. Meanwhile, Hiro uses his powers to travel to medieval Japan -- and finds out some shocking facts about his boyhood hero.

Unfortunately while the malevolent Sylar has lost his powers, he's still dangerous -- especially since he's teamed up with a woman who emits poison. The season revs up when a trip into the future reveals that the Shanti virus is going to kill over nine-tenths of the world. With no time to waste -- and a mysterious man who may or may not be an ally -- the Heroes must save humanity once again.

Unlike most shows about people with superpowers, ""Heroes"" isn't really about the action or flashy battles. It's half epic save-the-world-as-a-team story, and half exploration of how real, ordinary people would react if they suddenly found out that they had superpowers, and how this would change -- or NOT change -- their lives.

And the first season is a brilliant piece of work -- incredibly intricate and complex, since there are a dozen subplots and a lot of time travel, and a lot of exploration of the Heroes' previous lives. These complex storylines are enhanced by lots of suspense and tightly directed action, and the makers always know how to throw in a shocking twist (a sword-carrying future Hiro showing up) and some dark humour (Claire wakes up in mid-autopsy).

The second season is not quite as good -- the forcibly truncated length means that it's a bit oddly paced, and the vision-of-a-disaster-that-must-be-prevented is too similar to the first season. But it's still worth watching with all those creepy moments (such as the poison-woman with black eyeballs), and especially the malevolent Sylar.

The actors are pretty much all good -- Larter gives a great double performance, Zachary Quinto is a wonderfully twisted villain, and Panettiere gives a good performance as a teen whose adolescence has a lot more than hormones in store. Masi Oka is the standout, though -- his Hiro is sweet, endearing, geeky, heroic, sad, kindly, funny and thoroughly lovable, and grows in maturity as he works his way through the series.

The first two seasons of""Heroes"" start off brilliantly and continue a bit less brilliantly, but overall it is a solid, unusual sci-fi-drama that's well worth watching.",1230681600,2,4103,5.045790251107829

8308843,5,B001HL06H8,I love the idea of people with superpowers living among us. This series delves into how complex that would be in the world we live in. No one is all good or all bad. Each heroes is a multifaceted gem. I hope the new series will be as awesome.,1393632000,,242,3.9591836734693877

8308846,1,B001HL06H8,"First let me say I love heroes so don't take my 1 star review as a review on the show itself for Heroes I would give a 6 out of 5. I just don't quite get the pricing on this, its $153 for this with only seasons 1 and 2, if you just buy seasons 1 and 2 seperatly on blu-ray, it only comes to only $89, so you'd be paying $64 extra just to buy them together in this ""Franchise Collection"". I mean really, you could even add in season 3 and STILL be cheaper than this. It makes even less sense to me that the prices I used to figure this out were all shipped and sold by amazon. Anyway, if you're thinking of buying Heroes on blu-ray, I would highly recommend it, Heroes is awesome and blu-ray is awesome quality.

8308848,5,B001HL06H8,"If you are any kind of a superhero fan , this series was made for you. I would say this is just a more realistic version of x-men . Human mutation and evolution gave awesome powers to certain individuals and all these individuals are somehow connected with each other. Some individuals try to use their powers for good and some for evil and some just been hiding to avoid detection from regular humans because of fear of persecution. Each of these characters will not only discover their powers and learn how to use them but they also will discover a series of events that been happening from a long time and how these events affected their lives. During this process some will use these powers for good and some will use it for evil and some just some they will use it for their own personal gain.
