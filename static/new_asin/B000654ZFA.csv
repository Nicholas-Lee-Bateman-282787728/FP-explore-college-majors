8038697,4,B000654ZFA,"Perfect old school, silly educational school videos. Perfect for a good laugh, perfect to own a piece of educational history. Loved this set. Packaging is weak, nothing but a paper locker, would have been nice as a small metal locker, but the DVD's are priceless.",1429574400,2,263,4.866666666666666

8038700,4,B000654ZFA,"I purchased this set after buying the School Lunchbox Set.  This DVD set contains old ""educational"" films of the type once shown in public schools.  In this day and age, these films are incredibly dated and unintentionally funny.  I've been collecting these types of films for years, mostly for fun and nostalgia.

If you have similar interests, you can't go wrong buying this set as well as the Lunchbox Set I have already mentioned.",1410652800,6,434,4.824324324324325
8038701,3,B000654ZFA,The picture shows this item in what looks like a metal locker. The item I recieved came in a normal slipcase. Did it ever come in such a package? If not amazon should change the picture.,1317945600,5,186,4.194444444444445
8038702,3,B000654ZFA,"This 4 volume set included Patriotism & Social Engineering 201, both of these DVDs were already included in an earlier edition of The Educational Archives. Not sure why they would do that since there has to be literally thousands of 16mm educational film to choose from. Why not Patriotism 2 & Social Engineering 301? So, if you already own a previous set of these DVDs & you order this one, remember that two of the disks you're going to receive you already have!",1268092800,9,464,4.602409638554217
