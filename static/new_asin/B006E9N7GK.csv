8496840,5,B006E9N7GK,"I was more than pleased with my purchase of ""Grandes Peleas vol. 51! Why the "" Fight of the Century"", between Joe Frazier and Muhammad Ali is not available by itself in any other form is beyond me. ESPN constantly has marathons of Ali on it's many networks but always seems to  purposely bypass this fight as though it never even happened. Bert Sugar one of Boxing's most famous commentators said that it was the most ELECTRIC EVENT he ever was a part of and who would know better than him?  So until someone in the future gives this fight it's just due with a DVD of it's own do not be afraid to purchase this DVD, which gives you the entire "" Fight of the Century"" in it's entirety , round by round. And really, should we not have on the front of the DVD ,ALI laying on his back after FRAZIER decked him, instead of a picture of ALI decking SONNY LISTON a fight that happened years before the""FIGHT OF THE CENTURY"" ALI VS FRAZIER 1"" which is actually the fight the DVD advertises?????",1359331200,4,986,4.295698924731183
8496841,5,B006E9N7GK,"I have wanted my own copy of Frazier vs Ali 1 for years and now i own it. Huge fan of Smokin Joe Frazier cant beleive he is gone. What a tough warrior he was. I think he could have won a tittle in any era and i think would have held it a long time if it wasn't for George Foreman who did hold it in two eras. God really blessed the heavyweights in 70s and this fight was one of the best. i personally think it was better than the thrilla in manila. I own that one also on about three other dvds. now if i can only find the second fight to round out the trillogy. as an added bonus i got to watch the Floyd Mayweather vs Victor Ortiz fight. in my opinion Ortiz is to blame for the bad ending. Alfonso Gomez,Saul Alverez,Bruce Pearson, and the Great Julio ceasar Chavez round of this great dvd.",1342051200,,792,3.95625
8496842,5,B006E9N7GK,"It's a hell of a thing to celebrate Muhammad Ali's 70 birthday by revisiting his first professional loss, but I'm just glad GRANDES PELEAS made this classic bout available. This was heralded as ""The Fight of the Century,"" the first of Ali and Smokin' Joe Frazier's unforgettable trilogy. Even more than that, it was a historically significant event that transcended the sport itself and impacted on a cultural and societal level. This fight represented the tussle between the patriotic, conservative common folk versus the outspoken, anti-establishment community. And if you're not down with buzz words like ""immortal chapter in boxing lore"" and ""historical context"" and ""defining moments,"" then this DVD, GRANDES PELEAS #51, also gives us three other fights not nearly as important or compelling, but still fun to watch, each in their own respective way.

- Floyd Mayweather, Jr. vs. Victor Ortiz (9.17.11)

I guess we're working our way up, bottom to top. As such, the DVD kicks off with something pretty pathetic and yet fun in a grotesque roadside accident kind of way. This one features a cheap shot followed by an even more egregious cheap shot. Somewhere in the world is a boxer who can beat Floyd Mayweather - and it may even be Manny Pacquiao (or not) - but it for dang sure isn't Victor ""Vicious"" Ortiz who, on this night, lost his composure, lost his damn mind, when it mattered the most. Mayweather has a way of getting into his opponent's head. Mayweather is slick as sn0t and fast as a blink. His defense is nothing short of stellar, and folks trying to punch him end up not. Ortiz eventually got frustrated with slippery Floyd, although initially he exhibited enough speed to compete a bit. But it was only a matter of time before Floyd's blinding right hand leads rocked his confidence, not to mention redden his mug. Coming in with a 14 pound edge, Ortiz took these punches pretty well. You have to credit Floyd for (surprisingly) staying in the pocket for huge chunks of the rounds. He was flat-footed, he set on his punches. He applied his power shots. He must've seen that he could land at will on Ortiz.

Ortiz had his moments and actually managed to touch Floyd a bunch of times. In the infamous fourth round, he actually teed off with several shots in a row, which is when he got excited and deliberately headbutted Floyd. Referee Joe Cortez, fair but firm but growing ever older, deducted Ortiz for this but he should've kept his eyes on the fight. Whether Ortiz was truly remorseful or now concerned about Floyd's retaliation, dude suddenly embarked on an inside-the-ring apology tour, hugging Floyd over and over and saying sorry, bro. When the referee was looking away and Ortiz was still apologizing, Floyd clocked him good, first with a left hook, then with a signature right. Ortiz crumpled to the canvas and the ref counted him out. Protect yourself at all times, Ortiz! Quit with the hugs. This ain't no relative.

This was the shadiest (but still legal) sort of a knock out win, which is a shame because I think Floyd would've eventually knocked out Ortiz anyway. It sucks that the DVD doesn't have Larry Merchant's heated post-fight interview with Floyd, in which Floyd accused Larry of never giving him a fair shake and Larry told Mayweather he would've kicked his a-- if he were fifty years younger. I love you, Larry Merchant, but calm down. Mayweather would've starched you silly even if you'd been fifty years younger. But I love the old guy's gumption.

- Saul ""Canelo"" Alvarez vs. Alfonzo Gomez (9.17.11)

""Los peleadores estan listos!"" cried the ring announcer, and sucker that I was, I thought Gomez may have had a chance. Gomez wrote a rap song poking fun of Canelo's red hair, and when Canelo (which means ""cinnamon"") heard it, he thought it was a good song. So who's getting in whose head here? This one pits the 21-year-old red-head Mexican phenom against the likable 30-year-old veteran from the Contender reality show. Regarding Canelo's popularity, Larry Merchant had this to say: ""In terms of boxing, Los Angeles is northern Mexico.""

I've always liked Alfonzo Gomez. If only he had a punch to go with his heart and skills. But Gomez had a game plan for this contest, and he employed it to pretty good effect the first few rounds, even though he got stretched in the first round by a short Canelo left hook. Mostly, though, Gomez's constant head movement, activity, and a lowered center of gravity seem to bemuse Canelo and worked to make him seem lethargic. Gomez actually was the aggressor, with Canelo seemingly unable to get off. But Alvarez shook off the cobwebs in the fifth round and his power began to impose itself on Gomez. In round 6, Gomez got visibly shook by a Canelo barrage initiated by a wicked uppercut and right cross. I thought it a premature stoppage later on in that same round, but, really, it was inevitable. The Canelo train keeps on chugging. Put him against Chavez, Jr. already.

- Julio Cesar Chavez vs. Bruce Pearson (October 31, 1992)

The moral of this fight is, dude, don't hit Julio Cesar Chavez intentionally below the belt. Chavez's beatdown of Bruce Pearson wouldn't go three rounds, commemorating yet another routinely dominant performance by Mexico's greatest fighter ever. It's beyond silly how intimidating this guy was, and how his opponents so quickly find themselves swimming in deep waters. Chavez unloaded his arsenal on Pearson, his wicked left hooks to the body, his punishing right hands. And when Pearson, hoping to buy some time, decked Chavez in the Chavez, Jr., it only revved up Chavez's engine even more. Pearson probably had one of them ""Oh dear lord!"" moments when Chavez furiously waved off the referee's offer of a time out to recuperate. Oh, and the ringside commentary is in Spanish. Not that you need to know Spanish. Chavez's actions are easily translated.

- Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier 1 (March 8, 1971)

This one, I'll keep short, because how could I possibly do it justice? You know what's up with this fight. Two undefeated, undisputed heavyweight champs going toe to toe, with Ali having something to prove and Frazier harboring a mad-on for all the mean stuff Ali's said about him. Yeah, I guess you can mention how Ali's best years were stripped from him, when he was banned from the sweet science for three and a half years. He wasn't quite the same dancing master anymore. Ali had his moments - he even shook up Frazier one time - but Frazier's sheer aggression ultimately took its toll and trumped Ali's rallies. Ali absorbed some hellacious left hooks until he finally did wither in the end. If nothing else, Ali demonstrated how granite his beard was. There were several exhilarating exchanges here, but, mostly, it was Joe who was smokin' Ali. Their third fight, ""The Thrilla in Manila,"" is more exhalted and is more savage. But while their first encounter wasn't exactly the ""Fight of the Century"" it was flaunted to be, it WAS the first and it was relevant and it was pulse-pounding enough.

Finally, note that the Erik Morales vs. Cesar Cano fight is NOT included here, even though the DVD cover indicates as such. That's too bad. El Terrible's skills may have greatly eroded but, in this fight, he showed his big heart yet again.",1327622400,,7261,4.7907348242811505
