8266765,3,B0017OLUWU,"A detective story with plenty of unexpected revelations. A famous photographer (Michael Dalmar) goes missing, and a lesbian detective, Abigail Marks is hired to find a few answers. Why does she have to smoke? This is little tired, old fashioned and cliche, this was filmed in 2008, let's move on. Michael has a twin brother, and he makes out to be Michael which puts him in danger. Together they trace the last steps of Michael before his disappearance. Murder, mystery, sex, nudity, excitement, drama, this is not your usual gay movie. I'm not sure what the title ""2 minutes later"" refers to.",1385510400,2,593,4.823529411764706

8266767,2,B0017OLUWU,"Disappointing attempt at gay film noir from writer/director Robert Gaston.  Take a premise lifted straight from ""Blow Up"", add a dash of ""Rear Window"", and you have the basic plot.  A gay insurance investigator (Michael Molina) attempts to solve the mystery of his identical twin's disappearance.  He joins forces with a lesbian private eye, and the two delve into his photographer brother's past to determine the truth.

The results are a mixed bag.  Director Gaston manages to build some genuine suspense into the proceedings.  The photography and production values are suitably gritty.  And Jessica Graham gives a very good performance as the tough-as-nails P.I. who pulls our hero's bacon out of the fire on more than one occasion.

But there are some real problems with this film, the main one being its length.  Clocking in at barely an hour the movie has little time for coherent plot development.  A couple of gratuitous sex scenes make matters worse by slowing down the action and wasting precious time.  And then there is the protagonist.  As played by Molina he is a pretty bland and not terribly interesting character.

There was a lot of potential in this film, but it never quite makes the grade.  With more time and a better script this one could have been a winner.",1330560000,2,1281,4.87037037037037
8266768,1,B0017OLUWU,"At best, this movie is a poorly crafted attempt to cash in on the emerging genre of gay noir.  At worst, it is ham-fisted softcore porn.  In either case, it's not very pretty.  The acting is wooden, the script is BEYOND dumb, and the directing variously reminds me of digital home movies and slapdash film school projects.  C'mon, guys.  Just because you're shooting on zero-budget doesn't mean you have to create this lame unwatchable cinematic turd.  If you want to see some gay noir made with no bucks that's actually worth watching, take a look at Tom Kalin's SWOON (1992).",1310515200,2,577,4.72
8266769,4,B0017OLUWU,"I liked this one much better, and it had better audio (still could have been less muddy) than Open Cam.

The plot line was just a tiny bit thin, I could see what was coming.  But it had great promise, a great detective team, and the ending gives me hope of sequels...",1222992000,3,267,4.115384615384615
8266770,2,B0017OLUWU,"High school drama class  combined with the football and pom pom squids would be the way I would describe the acting and plot development.  Was hard for the movie to hold my interest even with the eye candy, can see  that online anytime.",1217376000,,236,4.441860465116279
8266771,4,B0017OLUWU,"In the best tradition of straightening freedoms of new millennium filmmakers tell of a lesbian detective working for a gay guy to solve a mysterious disappearance of his twin brother-photographer.

Dialogues and lack of context have been filled with scenes of nudity and sexual activities making a viewer supposing that this is all in a world around.

Nice music, easy watching plot, not too dirty visualisation.

Perhaps, this work belongs to an oncoming genre of movies mixing variety of sexual activities for a general viewing.",1217289600,5,530,5.211764705882353
8266772,4,B0017OLUWU,"the acting wasn't the greatest.
what was nice about the movie was the background.  if you are from the philly area, you can see where they filmed this movie.
it was nice to support a local movie company.  but, they had made the ending as if they could add a sequel to it.
if you like male nudity.. this has it!",1216080000,13,310,4.065573770491803
8266773,5,B0017OLUWU,"Well thought out production that is expertly filmed and the actors well chosen and superb in their respective roles. Very believable plot. In addition, there is the bonus of a little male eye candy. Enjoyable. Twist surprise ending. A film well worth viewing repeatidly.",1215302400,13,270,5.159090909090909
