Being from Hawaii and knowing one of the actors made this an interesting experience for me!
Had no idea they were in this movie till I watched it. hah.
I love the story.",1426032000,,195,4.0256410256410255

The fact that it is filmed in Waikiki, makes the background of every scene beautiful and breathtaking. The story is unique and since the characters are so relatable you really get a sense that the story is true and really happening!  The creators did a great job of making this film standout to keep the audience entertained, while telling a somewhat twisted and frightening story! The surprise ending was just that..not what I was expecting. Overall I would recommend  Makua Charley to anyone who is looking for a fun and frightening story with twists and turns to keep you on the edge of your seat!",1383091200,4,706,4.7317073170731705
8616019,5,B00FJC85OM,"I had the privilege of reading this script, preproduction, and I was blown away.  The script was tight and ""fat free"", i.e. brief and concise. Albert and Jayne Cloutier are true alchemists, turning a $10,000.00 budget into movie gold!!!!!.  This film shows what can be accomplished with true artistic talent, grit and determination. Plot, direction, acting, cinematography, editing, and special effects  all first rate! Watching this film is a wonderful way to support a couple of  true, outstanding  indie film makers

An engaging, entertaining  way  to  discover one of Hawaii's classic legends, Nanaue The Shark Man!!!!!",1382400000,2,623,5.40625
8616020,4,B00FJC85OM,"I found this film to be pure entertainment. The plot drew me in until I wanted to yell at the young female victim to not go with the bad guy. Characters avoided being stereotypes so I wasn't bored by the ""nerd"", ""goth"", or ""mama in wheelchair"" because they carried the plot along. I was anxious to see what was going to happen next. There's a bit of bloody gore and some sexual references.  The ending was a surprise and I loved it. I live in Hawaii so recognized some of the scenery and cultural references, yet they explained Hawaiian terms and legends as they went along. A lot of the film made me smile. I only gave it 4 stars because some of the acting seemed monotone. Worth watching though.",1381536000,4,697,4.361538461538461
