4146539,5,B003L77GGK,"I loved it....Dean and Sam have changed. Sam is now the Doom and Gloom and Dean is now the Optimist. It is refreshing. I also like that they now have a Family. I loved Bobby so I am so glad they have Bobby continue to be the ""Father"" figure......Great start to a great new season!!!!",1285545600,3,283,4.163636363636364
4146540,5,B003L77GGK,"The season opener is wonderful.  It presents a completely new foundation for the series.

1. Revised and upgraded characters with convincing new backstory;

2. better defined and more convincing personality for Sam and Dean and Bobby and new characters;

3. less like a comic book, strong, confident script writing;

4. well-conceived and realized villains;

5. Subtle and convincing special effects;

6. dialogue, story line, etc., less contrived and believable;

7. lingering undercurrent of uncertainty and suspense about who Dean can trust, about what is really going on, the sense that there is a lot that you need to know but don't know yet;

8. more believable, better grounded in ""real world"";

9. like a whole new series, starting from scratch - a complete reboot;

10. story draws you right in;

11. less wild and unbelievable plot line;

12. episode 1 satisfying in itself and leaves you looking forward eagerly to the new season;

Do not hesitate. Buy episode one and enjoy.",1285459200,5,986,5.043478260869565
4146541,2,B003L77GGK,"My son and I were both really disappointed in the new seasons 1st episode. It lack so much including a decent plot line. We expected a more exciting story - since Sam and Grandpa are fresh from heaven and hell plus not a whole lot about the cousins. Why the gin creatures? There could have been other creatures that would have made a better story like demons, the trickster, ghosts...these are all creatures they have done multiple episodes on - but the gin - 1 episode and it wasn't focused on the creatures. This just seemed to be the type of episode you would see mid season - not one to start to season off with. It was just flat. What happened - new writers???? We hope the other episodes have some umpf to them...btw, it was neat seeing Corin Nemic, glad to know he has a paying gig and isn't doing those silly internet shows with David Faustino anymore :)",1285459200,2,862,4.3602484472049685

And the unique episodes of ""The French Mistake"" and ""My Heart Will Go On"" are a great addition to the stable of different approaches that the Supernatural writers and directors sometimes take.

The blu-ray: 5 stars easily. After the kind of meh blu-rays of season 3 and 4, it was great to get back to a plethora of extras!",1487980800,,452,4.65

I have thoroughly enjoyed this series...Jared (Sam) & Jensen (Dean) are completely perfect for their roles ~ I almost can believe they would be brothers in real life. I especially enjoy the humor between the two main characters...yet, when they are angry or disappointed with each other, I can completely believe it.
The special effects are excellent, the acting (by everyone involved) is way above par. There is so much in this series ~ much more than one would expect from a TV show ~ I can't even begin to go there...
Being my age (65) I can remember ""way back when"" the lack of quality to a TV series ~ canned laughter, etc. ~ this show is among the best as far as I'm concerned...it keeps me engrossed from beginning to end...so much so that I hate to turn it off when it's time to move on with my day!
One of my favorite features is the ongoing variety of fantastical characters. So many I would have to watch from beginning to end once again, just to remember them all...
Right now my only complaint is that, even though I have bought every season on my Amazon Prime watch list, I can't make up my mind if I want to go ahead & order the DVD set as well.

4147885,5,B003L77GGK,"Season 6 takes the Supernatural crew further and further away from the original premise, ""Ganking Demons"".  But that's not necessarily a bad thing.  Without being a killjoy and spoiling the season here's what's happened.

Dean mellows out, a bit.
Cass doesn't.
Sam's confused.
Crowley becomes more integral.
Bobby keeps plugging along.
Ellen and Jo take a bow.

Supernatural, even straying from their original premise, keeps us (that would be my wife and I) coming back.  We look forward to watching a different episode nightly and will be rather upset once we've caught up to the current production.  Some episodes are better than others and one that looked like it was going to be rubbish turned out to be one of the funniest ever.  If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean.  It'll make you a ""Mischamigo"".

We'll keep watching as long as they keep it up.",1429747200,,859,4.789115646258503

4148154,3,B003L77GGK,"There are some misgivings about season 6, but the season also has some of my favorite episodes.

Love the introduction/musical montage of Exile on Main Street with Dean Winchester attempting to live an ordinary life.  Love the first half of The Third Half, and I enjoyed the introduction of Balthazar/Sebastian Roche.

One of my favorite episodes of the entire Supernatural oeuvre is Weekend at Bobby's.  I especially loved the music, Rufus Turner/Steven Williams's appearance in that episode was especially comical.

Clap Your Hands If You Believe was very funny, and Caged Heat was also very good - Castiel/Mischa Collins and Meg Masters/Rachel Miner had surprising chemistry.

Admittedly, The French Mistake was the jewel of the season, and it was wonderful and entertaining all the way through.

Some of the mysteries were good.

One of my favorite characters of the entire genre is Eleanor Visyak.  I wish there had been more of her.  She left way too soon.  She was one of the better female characters on the show.

Season 6 had some good to great episodes, but I understand the argument to have quit at season 5.",1416700800,,1119,4.925133689839572

It has its share of ""What were they thinking?"" episodes, but not everyone is going to like all of them. I, personally, liked the French Mistake episode, and I loved Caged Heat. Supernatural has a few ""clunker"" episodes sometimes, but I'm willing to stick with them through a few bad episodes to see what's going to happen to the boys and their pals.",1411862400,,427,4.631578947368421

He no longer hunts because of Sammie's death, the price of ending the Apocalypse. But, Sam is in Hell and Dean is hiding behind the supposed 'family life', can't take it anymore. The miracle of miracles, Sam reappears in human form in that, he is truly out of Hell, but his soul is missing. And because the soul houses ones mind, ones will and ones emotions, Sam's responses are robotic and intellectual only, devoid of any compassion or feelings, of any kind. Gone is the old Sammie. Even when Dean is attacked by a vampire, Sam is lethargic. Dean says good-bye to Lisa and Ben and the whole family, stable, routine life, and heads out again with Sam, not only to hunt but more importantly, in search of Sammie's soul. With a common goal the brother's reunite and as their custom, they fight demons, monsters, corrupt angels that have gone dark side, but not to the point that they can be called, demons. With Bobbie and the Warrior Angel - Castiel, helping them, they move forward in eradicating evil entities, harassing imps and their wanna-be's croonie's, to set individuals free from horrific torment and captivity, while hunting the culprit who has Sam's, soul. This profound Season 6 programming comes to you in the form of 6 discs and 22 exciting episodes. Hunting to get ones mind, ones will and ones emotions back within ones soul, is indeed an unusual odyssey. Yeah, eh:)! Nina Kish",1411689600,,1552,4.730627306273063

4148337,2,B003L77GGK,"I ordered three sets of Supernatural DVD's to complete my partner's collection. All three came in on the same shipment. Unfortunately for me, this was a birthday present and when she opened the box (too late to send it back) all three of the boxed sets were damaged. The plastic outer wrappings were torn, the cardboard outer case had multiple crushed edges. The ones that weren't crushed had worn edges to the outer box.  Inside one of the DVD cases, there was a DVD that was ""floating around"" in there without being secured on the case.  All DVD's play fine, but these boxed sets are not ""display shelf"" worthy and will have to be replaced.  Unfortunately I will have to do that on my own, because, as I said, this was a gift and it didn't get opened in time to send it back to them for refund/exchange.  Therefore I have no other option but to give this a lower review.

Note: All three of the boxed sets were purchased as NEW.

I'm leaving the same review on all three sets that I purchased.

I get annoyed when nobody ever stays dead. There were some moments in this season that were entertaining, but overall I felt it was gilding the lily to have this at all, except instead of gold, imagine adding noxious manure around a hardy lily with the misguided thought of keeping it going longer.

I started to watch the show in 2006, I know it started in 2005, but I was not watching much television at the time.  I got the complete first season and that was all it took.  I was hooked, and that is hooked with a capital H.  I found myself looking forward to each new episode each week.  The writing is very good, the acting is good and they research the story lines and are able to blend fact and fiction in a seamless way.  I remember first watching season six and seeing all the bonus material and was just engrossed in it.  All the people involved in the show do a great job season after season.  This is a very good season but to really get the most bang for your buck, I recommend going back to the beginning of the show from season one, or at the least season five.  In no time you will discover why this is such a popular and long running show.  And follow the Winchester brothers and enjoy how each episode and season follow their journey.

4148652,4,B003L77GGK,"I have all the seasons of Supernatural. I love the show. I love the plot. I LOVE the actors. But nearly every seasons DVD case has arrived damaged! The plastic pieces that hold the different DVDs in place (like the binding on a book, that allows you to flip through the DVDs for the right episode) are always broken. So the DVD cases go everywhere and it makes it hard to close the case correctly. Otherwise it would be a 5 star.",1379030400,,429,4.2439024390243905

4148658,5,B003L77GGK,I love Supernatural. The storyline of 2 brothers out to save the world and mostly succeeding is compelling. Through all the seasons I have been captivated by these 2. Set aside the fact that you have two very attractive men to follow and you still have amazing story lines. I recommend this season to anyone. Even my redneck boyfriend gets absorbed by Sam and Dean.,1376870400,,365,4.630769230769231

4148671,5,B003L77GGK,Season 6 is a bit better than Season 5. I love Supernatural. It is one of my top 5 favorite shows for sure and probably in my top 3. Having said that there really is no doubt that after the strike shortened 3rd year the show slowly started to go down hill a bit. Once Dean died and they added Angels in it just wasn't as... believable maybe. (That may just be the former seminary student in me though...) I love Castiel. Don't get me wrong. Its all of the other angels I don't like and their treatment of heaven. But I can look past that and I honestly feel that the show is starting to pick back up again. I would recommend.,1375401600,,625,4.0894308943089435
4148672,5,B003L77GGK,"First, this gets 5 stars because of speed of delivery and packaging. I happen to love this series also. I started watching season 1 because of boredom one day. Not sure how I obtained it but I had Season 1 and 2. I'm a junkie now and when I like something I don't just go half way I go nuts, so says the hubby. I don't believe in moderation. I bought the other 6 seasons, 2 at a time on a weekly basis.

The boys have a lot to face this season and you find yourself double guessing whats going to happen at every corner. It makes it well rounded and you'll find yourself itching for more!

4148782,5,B003L77GGK,"I've purchased the entire available series after watching them on TV over the years when last season ended. There simply is nothing else comparably good or entertaining. Can't wait for the next season, meanwhile watching again from the start is it.

Series start with two boys, brothers whose characters and personalities emerge as you go through the episodes with them. Subtle nuances in the role are superbly handled by Jensen and Jared along with other cast members. Later seasons are deeper in meaning because the estranged brothers develop their relationship and pick up the pace as the storyline progresses.
Chemistry between the main actors which shows on-set or even during interviews is an incredible match to the story line, the on-screen brotherly ribbing, smart-assery, pranks, but also genuine caring and brotherly love shine through, which makes the series irresistible.
This might sound trite, but the series is truly well written with a storyline and mythology behind it that just sucks the viewer in. No wonder Supernatural fans are fiercely devoted.",1370476800,,1067,5.276470588235294

4148816,5,B003L77GGK,"Back in the day, when it was the ""WB"", I seen the promo's for this show. Little did I know that when I watched the ""Premiere"" it would pull me in, mezmerize me and make me a, what my friends call me, fanatic.  If you are into the ""Supernatural"", with Vampires, Werewolves and all other creatures of the night, if you are not watching this show, I can only say...Why?...Jensen and Jared may not be brothers in real life, but their chemestry, their ability to ""know"" what each other is thinking is incredible. They are the only ones who could ever, ever be Sam and Dean Winchester. The underlying story of ""Hell"" vs. ""Heaven"" and their unrelenting quest to take care of the ""Family Business"" drives this show to a ""edge of your seat"", white knuckle thrill ride. It pains me to say that the show did lose it's momentum, the last several years, but this season, it's back to it's classic first years. Giving its loyal fans what we look for in the show.

The only other show that did this for me was the ""X-files."" I have the Collectors edition box set.

""Supernatural."" I have every Season.
Then I got a Blue ray player and Hi-def Television.

In one trip, I bought every season on Blu-ray. (I Buy both regular and Blue ray sets.) Fanatic. Yes..and proud of it.

If you've never seen it....watch the 1st episode. You will be hooked.

To Jared and Jensen...Thank you!
To the CW, treat this show like Gold. Because that's what you have!",1368230400,,1430,4.459770114942529

4148862,5,B003L77GGK,Season 6 is not viewed as great by many fans but outside the plot holes and little things that don't make sense the actors hold their own well and the ongoing story overall is great until the final episode which is somewhat a waste. This episode begins to show that Cas has quite a bit he is not sharing with Sam and Dean and Bobby suspects all may not be right.,1366416000,,362,4.112676056338028
4148863,5,B003L77GGK,Season 4 & 5 were my favorites... but though this season started slow (how do you beat stopping the apocalypse?) The emotional journey that Dean and Cas go through...and eventially Sam was a great addition to the Winchester Brothers' saga. Mixing in Crowley and more fatherly help from Bobby just enhanced things. The new monsters and mystery problems made for lots of surprises.,1366329600,,379,5.031746031746032

The series is wrapped around just about any supernatural being, and explains some of the history on said creatures. Each season finale leaves a huge cliffhanger that leaves you on your toes for the next episode. If you love the supernatural, you'd love this series.",1359072000,,429,4.733333333333333

If you've ever watched this and enjoyed it, get them on DVD, you'll be glad you did. If you've never watched them, but enjoy stories of the supernatural, try it. One of the best things about the series is the relationship between brothers, Sam and Dean. There's been a lot of character developement for both of them and although there have been estrangements, their bond keeps getting stronger.",1357776000,,549,4.7894736842105265

4149123,5,B003L77GGK,"The discs themselves were great. They played perfectly. The price for the entire season was insanely reasonable, and it arrived much quicker than I expected it to; which I've come to expect with Amazon (I just love that!). In my humble opinion, Season Six had to be one of my least favorite seasons. Don't get me wrong, I adore Supernatural, and I'm a fan of pretty much every season, but Season Six had more moments of dislike from me than some of the others. The season is good, but Sam was such a jerk-face, and Dean was a whiny thing that needed to be slapped. I still loved Sam and Dean and Cas to little bits and pieces, though. Both of them needing to be slapped aside, of course.",1356220800,,687,4.333333333333333

Clever writing, great banter between the two brothers, and lots of action with Sam and Dean dispatching demons and evil spirits and 'saving the day' over and over and over again.

4149147,3,B003L77GGK,"I've been an avid fan since 9/13/2005. I own every season, with that being said this is not the SPN I fell in love with.  The first mistake was the season premiere, there was no ""Road So Far"" and rock music recapping season 5. That is a huge part of the show, we as fans look forward to that well at least I do.  Then you got ""The Campbells"" that was just a terrible idea, I cheered when they all got axed. The big bad for season 6 was just awful, ""The Mother of All Creatures"" seriously. The brothers chemistry was so not there especially the first half of the season, we had to wait until the second half of the season to see that heart wrenching hug between Sam and Dean. I applaud Jared on his acting, he was awesome as Soul less Sam. Out of 22 episodes I only truly enjoyed 6. Sera Gamble dropped the ball with this season and even season 7.",1353715200,,846,4.090361445783133

4149179,5,B003L77GGK,"Yeah, season one and two were awesome!  Season three had it's great moments and season 4 and 5 were mindblowingly good, so it makes you begin to ask: when are the writers going to run out of steam?  Or when are the main actors going to get sick of their roles, which usually happens in something as long running as this.  However this was not the case.  Once again, Supernatural tops itself with great acting, clever writing and excellent direction.  First of all, Jared, Jensen, Misha and Jim Beaver are and will always be awesome actors.  I wish i had a quarter of the talent that these guys have.  Crowley and Balthazar are also characters where the actors are splendid.  Rufus is brilliant!  To see Ellen again is a pleasant and wonderful surprise.  Not to mention, the guest stars and ensemble cast are also flawless.

And as for the writing, there are so many great episodes in this season that it leaves me speechless.  For example there's Two and a half men, the third man, frontierland, weekend at bobby's, like a virgin, death at samarrah, you can't handle the truth, clap your hands if you believe, unforgiven, the man who would be king, mommy dearest, my heart will go on, the french mistake. the man who knew too much, and caged heat, are all great episodes.  And I'm pretty sure there are some other good ones that I'm forgetting in there too.

And the funny thing is I am not a horror fan at all.  I never like to watch scary movies and I am a hopeless Jane Austen/Bronte fan where I love to re-watch old classics. Don't get me wrong, I love action/super hero movies also, and artsy stuff like Coraline, Stardust, and Nightmare Before Christmas. But still, the fact that I would put down Jane Austen or the Bronte movies in a heartbeat and put in Supernatural instead shows how great this show is.  It took someone who didn't like that genre, and makes them like that genre.",1349827200,2,1889,4.511764705882353
4149220,5,B003L77GGK,"Once again the show delves in with gusto - and a few surprises. I very much liked this season, with the emergence of a new story arc, new characters, and the return of our favorite characters. The acting is spot on, and the bonus features are again a much appreciated addition!",1349395200,,277,4.450980392156863
4149221,5,B003L77GGK,"I'm a HUGE Supernatural fan. The seasons come with hours of bonus features and thinks for you to geek out on. If you are a true fan, you need to buy these. I have all of the seasons and I watch them regularly. You won't be disappointed.",1349222400,,236,4.042553191489362
4149222,4,B003L77GGK,"Season 6 is the first Supernatural season with Kripke gone and I have to say I felt it.  There was something missing, especially in the first few episodes.  I couldn't help but notice it, like a baby deer trying to find it's footing on these new googly legs it has.  Something wasn't right and it had nothing to do with the status of Sam's soul.  As the season progressed that deer grew up a little bit and it's knees weren't so crazy to stand on but something was still kind of off about it.  It couldn't be helped.  The only way to bring that back is to bring back Kripke.  I don't see that happening; not in the same capacity anyway.  Don't get me wrong; there were definitely some episodes that had my laughing my butt off but it was a little off, like pudding that may be toeing the line of still being good.  It still tastes like pudding but it leaves an aftertaste that a little bit wrong.",1348531200,2,896,4.223529411764706

4149224,5,B003L77GGK,Awe man you guys are crackin me up with your reviews. But yes I think everyone who knows good tv and has some sense will say that this season 6 was a joke. They had the nerve to have cass say he was God? omgosh I swear when I seen that I said yeah this show is done. But I will still see where the story goes bucause im curious but they're talking about a season ten? yeah I couldn't even watch season 7 on tv thats how unappealing the show is for me now. I mean come on cass God? these writers gonna get struck by lightning. But this show is still pretty good. Just they need to end it soon or it will be just like pokemon or power rangers.,1347840000,,641,3.8636363636363638

4149227,2,B003L77GGK,I like this show and think that the ideas are very original  when it comes to depicting angels and other awesome things.  I was in the infantry and I like cruel humor but this season crosses the line.  One of the episodes shows a guy in a dentist chair not being able to lie and tells the dentist in great describtion how he was alone with his 7 year old daughter to rape her.  WTF.... little things like this go on for the whole season.  It crossed the line from entertainment to terrible.,1345420800,4,490,4.225806451612903

4149290,5,B003L77GGK,"Supernatural is not your run-of-the-mill TV show. It has unique storylines, awesome special effects, snappy dialogue and great characters, like Death and Balthazar.

Season Six is one of the best seasons. SPOILER ALERT: We get to see Sam shirtless and Dean turn into a vampire. It has the episode called ""The French Mistake"" where Dean and Sam are transported to a universe where they are merely actors on a TV show called ""Supernatural"". That episode is an absolute riot.",1342396800,2,472,4.974683544303797

It looks close to the orginals, but definately not the same material. The picture that was in the DVD casing was obviously not well handed. The small booklet that was inside that provided as the episode guide was not in good condition. The DVD's all look real and I played the first episode. The quality seems amazing, but the menu is not the same as the other five seasons. I don't mean to nit pick.
If this is the real thing, then I just must've gotten a very bad product(though I doubt it to be authentic, though it's very close). Even if it is the real thing, I apologize for thinking it's fake, but if it's real and looks this bad.... Something went wrong there.

Granted, this season is by far the least in quality compared to the other seasons, but it is still enjoyable. It starts out well, gets slow in the middle (and a bit off track), but picks up again with a nice season finale. The season gives you a bit of a different perspective on Dean and Sam - in a way they almost switch roles, with Sam being more of the tough guy and Dean more of an emotional character. If you like the character Bobby, his presence in this season seems a bit more robust than in others. Overall, worth watching, but it will make you long a bit for previous seasons intensity and creativity.

4149458,4,B003L77GGK,"I bought this dvd set with the anticipation of not liking it as much as the first 5 seasons, because my expectations were so high. To be fair, it's very hard to top releasing Lucifer from Hell and stopping the end of the world. I remember feeling a bit disappointed, just a little bit, when watching the episodes new on tv. However, when I went back and watched them again on dvd, for some reason, I found it a lot more entertaining than I remember.

The problems with this season, in my opinion, are that the characters and plot seem to take a while to catch on. For example, seeing Grandpa Campbell was cool, but all of his other hunter relatives were killed off before we could figure out why we should care about them. The show spent many weeks building up the new villain, Eve, only to kill her off suddenly in a somewhat questionable way by Dean. Supernatural fell into the same trap that Smallville did when they spent all season building up Doomsday, then rapidly got rid of him in an unsatisfying way after a very short confrontation. The biggest problem with this season, really, is that the plot spun its wheels for so long. Too many questions, not enough answers. In season 5, the mission was clear from the start: fight Lucifer, stop the apocolypse. Clear enough. This time around, not so much.

So, having said all that, there was a whole lot of good stuff in this season as well. First and foremost is Jensen Ackle's directing in ""Weekend at Bobby's."" That was a very good episode. Seeing Sam and Dean as babysitters was funny, and I am one of the ones who loved ""The French Mistake."" It's great when a show can poke fun at itself like that, and I hope they do another one like this. I also liked Dean as a reaper for 24 hours. And, as for my title quote, when Dean blows up a rock to get at a dragon-slaying sword, he mumbled that line as he was wiring up the explosives, and that just cracked me up.

Looking ahead to Season 7, from what we have seen so far, it seems that the show anticipated my gripes, because we have a clear mission from the beginning once again: stop the leviathans from conquering the Earth. It looks very promising so far.",1325462400,,2163,4.375621890547263

The series continued at this high level for several years.
After the producers introduced the apocalypse storyline the show lost its way, but there are still some wonderful episodes in season six, particularly for long time fans of the series.
People new to the show are likely to miss many of the In-jokes so prevalent in season six, but it is still possible to get considerable entertainment out of it.",1324598400,,572,4.907216494845361
4149598,5,B003L77GGK,"What more can I say? This season had its good points and its bad points (though far more good than bad), but even at its worst, Supernatural is still one of the best shows on TV.",1324512000,,178,3.9722222222222223
4149609,5,B003L77GGK,"This sixth season is essential. It has to be Solomon's season. It means everyone and everything is facing double choices, if not twice double or even three times double. Things become very complicated and at the end you are just amazed that all our ""friends"" have survived. At the same time it seems that complexity is the fact that several lines are used at the same time to create havoc and chaos. The line of the stealing of God's weapons is hardly used twice with the Staff of Moses and Gabriel's Horn of Truth, though this one was a false alarm. This use of that line seems to be a diversion in the season, though it brings a nice diversion in the plot by throwing Sam and Dean onto the set of the TV series known as Supernatural and then they are confronted with their ""civilian"" identities and realities while Castiel is planning the capture of the keys to the cupboard or cabinet or closet in which God's weapons are stored. When Castiel finally succeeds against Crowley, the demon Virgil and the ambushed Raphael, he brings the boys back into their real world of Supernatural.

Another line is more consistent in the season. It is the line of the Mother of All, though it is a side line too. It is essential because it crosses many episodes. It is important too because it reveals something about the Campbells, the ""family"" of Samuel Campbell, the grandfather, dead and damned but brought back by Crowley for a very special mission. He, surrounded by his grandchildren (Sam as well, but not Dean at first), is tracking down what is called Alphas, the first monster of each kind, in order to get access to Purgatory. Being hunted, all the various types of monsters react by awakening their original creator, their mother, called the Mother of All and named Eve. Brought on Earth, Eve will try to protect her children against the more and more aggressive hunters.

This line is very disruptive because to kill the Mother of All, who is transforming everyone she touches into Jefferson Starships (an invention of the Winchesters), Starships for short, monsters of a new hybrid nature, to kill her they need the ashes of a Phoenix, which is rare. That leads them back to Samuel Colt (another Samuel, another Sam) we already know since he is the one who built the giant Devil's trap that blocked the Devil's Gate that was opened in an earlier season. Dean and Sam need then to go back to March 5, 1861 when according to his journal, Colt killed a phoenix. That gives us a nice remake of a remake of a Clint Eastwood film via Back to the Future. The Phoenix was hanged in a small frontier place and he revived on the following morning and came back to burn the three people he considered miscarried justice. Which he does. But Dean has become the sheriff in the mean time and Sam is trying to bring Colt and instead of the man he will bring THE Colt that can kill demons and phoenixes. Sam will arrive just in time to give the gun to Dean who will summon Flinch (that's the name of the phoenix) to a duel in the main street and he will kill the Phoenix who will burn down into ashes. But Castiel will bring them back before they could collect the prize and without bringing the gun back. Luckily the US Postal Service delivers a package from a certain Samuel Colt that contains the ashes, a letter and a broken portable telephone Dean or Sam had left behind, but not the Colt.

This episode will lead to the confrontation with the Mother of All and she will ask Dean and Sam to become her allies. Dean will refuse blankly and provoke her into biting him, which was deadly for her because Dean had gotten a refill in Phoenix ashes just before. Then Castiel and Crowley clean up the plate.

That leads us to the first and essential complication  of this season: the couple Castiel Crowley who are dancing page after page between life, death and eternal anything (life, death, void, suffering, enjoying, you name it you have it).

Sam was brought back at the beginning of the season from the cage where he was locked up with Lucifer, Michael and of course his half brother Adam. It remains a well kept secret about who did it. It will be revealed later on it was Castiel. But this Sam is soulless and is recuperated by another revived corpse, Samuel Campbell, the grandfather who was killed in some earlier season. But it is revealed then that this Samuel was brought back up by Crowley, the King of Hell in the absence of Lucifer, who wanted two things: a guarantee and some servants. He will get the guarantee from Bobby who will accept to give him his soul for ten years provided he saved Sam. But that was a lure. On the other side Crowley wants Samuel Campbell and some others in his family on the Campbell's side (some being possessed demons) to work for him under the promise he will bring Mary Campbell, the mother of Dean and Sam, back to life. The job is to capture monsters, especially alpha-monsters (first monster on a line) For Samuel or Crowley to torture them in order to get from them the location of the gate to Purgatory.

But at the same time Castiel wants access to this Purgatory (and we can imagine Raphael wants it too) in order to recuperate the millions upon millions of souls there that would give the person who will get them a phenomenal power. The war then is a war between three people, in the absence of Lucifer and God, the King of Hell, Crowley, the angel Castiel and the Archangel Raphael. The one who will get these Purgatory souls will be the new god. You can imagine the consequences with Crowley (hell on earth and in the universe), Raphael who is the fundamentalist in the angelic family and wants to restart the Apocalypse which has to happen because god has said so, even in his absence, and the small little rank and file angel Castiel who does not want that apocalypse to be reopened and who wants to manage the world and the universe in a gentler way.

Before getting to the final battle, the series has to solve some secondary issues.

First it has to enable Bobby to recapture his soul from Crowley. That will be difficult since they will have to go to Scotland to dig up the bones of his human identity and menace him to burn them if he does not do what he is asked to do. He will be incited into doing that by the presence of the ghost of his son who has given all kinds of nasty details about his father, which is not surprising in two ways. The son is a fink because the father was a turd, and the father is in hell and has managed to get to the top because he was a metaphorical shark and a metaphorical ghoul and a metaphorical vampire in his real life. The son merely had to give away anything but his father's tomb location, in order for the two Winchesters to get the bones. Of course the Winchetsers and company make the mistake not to keep the bones after Crowley yielded, so that they lost their power over him. Crowley rushed to Scotland to gather his bones and hide them away.

In fact the bones will have another episode: Castiel will find them and he will try to get some information about Purgatory and the Mother of All from Crowley along with the Winchesters. Crowley will refuse and Castiel will burn the bones and Crowley. But it will appear later on that at least not all the bones were burnt, if any of them at all since Crowley will survive his burning episode and come back with a vengeance but also with a pact with Castiel. And that is where the plot sickens. Castiel staged up the death of Crowley himself to keep his dealing with him under the table, if not the carpet.

Another side line is that of dragons. To kill dragons you have to have a blade that was soaked in the blood of a dragon. To kill a dragon you must already have killed one. The impossible vicious circle. If you want the first wound you may inflict to a dragon is not mortal since so far the blade had not been dipped in dragon's blood. But the second blow, if you have the opportunity to do so, will be deadly. Dean and Sam find such a sword in the home of a San Francisco University professor, Ellie Visyak. It is slightly difficult to get it out of the piece of rock in which it is embedded, but with dynamite, more Nobel than noble, at least if it were not plastic of some kind, Dean manages to get it, or at least a long ands sharp enough piece of it for the job. And the dragons get destroyed.

This side story will become essential later.

Another side story is the calling of fairies by a clockmaker who has Parkinson's disease. The fairies work for him, drink milk, but they also capture the first born son of any family to serve their king Oberon. Dean is at stake because he is a first born. The shortcoming of fairies is that when they come across a pile of powder sugar they are compelled by their instinct to count the grains. That will enable Dean to remain with us. The ritual will be reversed and the fairies will go back and the clockmaker will retire.

Another side story has to do with skinwalkers. Dogs are not that friendly you know. Some of them and more and more are skinwalkers. They can change into men if they want and their target is to multiply as dogs and sooner or later answer the call and take over the humans and then they will be the new human race. Sam and Dean have to clean up a pack of them in a city and that is difficult indeed, but they manage because to do their business these skinwalkers have to be in human form. So one is captured and he is used in human form to bait the others and the plan works so well they are all killed, except the one who was the bait, only wounded in his dog's form and he goes away. That will lead to a very sad moment when he will try to confront the wife and child of the man he had actually killed and they know he had done it.

That's now time to come back into the picture of the season. Opening Purgatory.

But before it all we have to enter the recapturing of Sam's soul. To make things short, let me say it is Death, contacted by Dean, who will bring that soul back. That will mean a side-story since Dean will have to be Death for 24 hours, and he failed. Death however holds his promise. So Sam has his soul back, in fact only part of this soul: all that happened in the pit has not been erased because it is un-erasable, but has been locked up inside a wall or behind a wall and that wall has to remain intact, otherwise tremendous suffering will happen. Castiel is strictly opposed to that transaction and it reveals that since he brought Sam back, he is the one who decided to bring Sam back without his soul for reasons that are definitely not clear. But Castiel is at times weird in this season and over-empathetic concerning the ""family"" that Dean, Sam and Bobby would be to him, as if an angel had and needed to have a family, apart from God who is their fathers and other angels and archangels who are their brothers, and maybe sisters after all since an angel is at least androgyneous. Note angels are soulless too.

H.P. Lovecraft provides the track to the key to purgatory. On March 15 1937 with six other believers he performed a ritual to open the door and they succeeded, though no one, except a boy witness knows. One person came out, a monster for sure, we will never know its shape, and the door will close back. This monster will take the form of the boy's mother and this boy's mother is no one else but Ellie Visyak. It is Bobby who discovers the fact and Ellie is a good friend of his. So he warns her that all demonic and angelic forces are running after her. She took the warning too lightly and she got trapped by Castiel.

Castiel had an agreement with Crowley. As soon as he gets the blood of a native of purgatory he rejects his pact and Crowley has to run. But he comes back to confront Castiel with Raphael. He had changed his alliance. Raphael at that moment appears as a black woman. So Castiel goes away. But the jar of blood he had left behind is not Ellie's blood but dog's blood. So Crowley and Raphael perform a rite that does not work.

In the mean time Sam had gone down at Bobby's. He is unconscious. In fact we are provided with a story of what is happening to him. He is in a dream in which he has been exploded into three entities, three pieces. The first one that has little memory is the Sam with his soul, in fact he seems to be essentially the soul that death had delivered to him and has lost all memory of before right now and who he was. He is helped by a waitress and he manages to be attacked and confront the second Sam, the Sam without his soul, the Sam that came back from the pit, nothing but the body. He kills that Sam and recuperates his body and physical memory. But the warning is: wait and see till you meet the third one. The third one is his soul as it was burning in the pit, his full soul memory, and that third Sam is killed by the first reunified Sam and the third piece gets into him. He has recaptured his full soul memory and that hurts.

This leads us to the end. Dean and Bobby arrive at the place where Castiel and Crowley are supposed to meet. They arrive when the host of spirits arrive with Crowley and Raphael for their vengeance. They crawl out of the car and they witness Crowley and Raphael performing the ritual that fails. Castiel arrives then and reveals that the blood they had used was not the good one and he brings the jar of good blood but the jar is empty. He has performed the ritual and he has the souls. He makes Crowley disappear and he destroys the black lady Raphael. Then a completely deranged Sam arrives from behind and stabs Castiel in the back with no effect.

The story is closed there and Castiel says: ""I am not an angel anymore. I am the new god. You bow down and profess your love or I'll destroy you. You are not my family."" All that in spite of all the brotherly love and human empathy and friendship he had expressed to Dean and Sam. It is the underling that captured the supreme power of souls who has become the new god, all powerful, omniscient and ever present in space and time. Who can trust such an underling?

I guess the answer is in the next season, the season that is running right now.

It's an awful thing to say! But I truly did not care).  I actually went a month before forcing myself to watch the next two episodes and was feeling like I was kinda done with the series.

That being said, I'm pretty sure the original intention of the show was to end at the finale of season 5.  They'd decided to continue the story on, and this is why I think this season takes a few more episode than normal to bring you in.

I will say most of my friends who were fans had some issue staying with the series through this build-up (even I started having a doubt or two) but when you see where the story is going and the truths behind what's going on come out, you'll be glad you stuck with it.

4149778,3,B003L77GGK,"Season 6 in my opinion was the worst season so far.

Firstly, it is obvious that Sera Gamble is no Erik Kripke. The Ben/Lisa/Dean story line was ridiculous. It was drawn out and unnessecary. (I'm not a Dean/Lisa fan, there was NO chemisty between the actors). Besides, whenever Lisa was involved, Dean was not the loveable hunter we all know and love. And it felt like Dean was more of a supporting character to Sam and Castiel. Then there was ""Souless Sam"". Does every season have to involve some Evil! Sammy? We went through five seasons with this, can we have a little change? Though it was sad, Cas going darkside was the strongest plot.

There was some good points though. 6x05 where there was some funny Twilight bashing, 6x15 where reality and the show mixed together, and 6x18 where Sam and Dean enter the wild, wild west.

Season 7 is already stronger in my opnion (and I'm hoping Cas comes back in it later!)

4149873,5,B003L77GGK,"Who would have thought that after Eric Kripke had stepped down that Supernatural would continue in such a wonderfully faithful way. I believed in Sera Gamble as she had written a few of my favorite episodes from previous seasons (Jus in Bello, anyone?). I call this an encore season because, more than before, oldies but goodies come back for new (and often final) performances. Folks you thought you never would see again come back not just for cameos and ""Hey it's me"" effects but are vital elements of certain episodes.
  I have to admit, though, that the first two episodes are painfully slow paced and have syrupy dialogue that sounds like it is from a Lifetime Channel Halloween Special. However, from the third episode on, the pace gets back on track and the new story arc is introduced. I liked that the arc wasn't as tunnel visioned as in Season 3 when you knew that nothing big would have happened until the final episode (I loved that season but you knew nothing would be resolved until the end which cut back on re-watch value). There are a few surprises not revealed til the very end which then gives rise to even greater questions.
  The balance of visits from long gone characters both old and new and an interesting and ambitious story arc make Season 6 a great season. Sera Gamble was very wise to not try to one-up Season 5 but go in her own direction and cut the way for giving non-demon or angel related monsters their due. I liked it. It's the first time I can say that anyone who doesn't even know about Supernatural can hop on the train and enjoy the ride while those who have been with the show since the beginning will find no end to Easter Eggs and Cookies in the form of recurring characters and underlying meaning for what has come before now.",1317945600,,1771,4.507788161993769

They have genuine depth. These characters are friends, family, enemies--sometimes all three at once--and they have the ability to rip your heart to pieces. Oh, and there's plenty of bloodshed and horror (always a plus), as well as the humorous interruptions that make Supernatural so unique.

I watched it yesterday and I'm still laughing about it today when I think about some of the scenes.  It's great to have some good comedic relief in a serious show like Supernatural.  I love how they made fun of themselves and their own show.  Dean said ""who would watch this stuff?"" and Sam said ""according to the reporter, not many people.""  And they made fun of the props.  LOL!  Great episode.  I will probably even watch it again!!",1317340800,2,524,4.329896907216495
4149909,5,B003L77GGK,"If I had to compare this season to a movie in a series, it probably be Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines. You know that the stakes are high in the movie and that the fate of the world hangs on the balance with John Conner and ""Ah-nold,"" but you just never take as seriously as T2 because every other scene has you bursting with laughter. Well this show had me laughing in EVERY episode...but in a good way.

The story line for this season is good, but in my opinion not as ""stakes are so high"" story-lines as season 2, 3, 4, and 5. In fact I felt that this season took the story to a more personal importance, along the lines of season 1 and 3 as opposed to ""oh no the world is coming to an end, we have to figure out a way to stop it!"" Season 1 was trying to figure out where the brothers stood in terms of fighting the yellow-eyed demon, and season 3 was Sam trying to find a way to save his brother Dean from going to hell, and I felt the same type of personal urgency from this season as those two seasons.

This time Dean has to save Sam (spoiler alert!) by finding his soul. Sam is a walking, empty husk with no soul inside, but also an emotionless, uncaring psychopath who will do anything to finish a ""job"" - even risking the life of his own brother Dean. So you can imagine how much personal conflicts arise with this predicament and how many times the show can get really emotional. However, at the same time I have to say that this season was also the funniest season.

For example, looking at the ""The French Mistake"" episode, (where the brothers go to an alternate reality where they find they are only actors named Jensen/ Jared who only act like they are killing monsters and there are no real monsters, demons, or angels) where the two brothers spend nearly 5 minutes doing a take on a scene over and over again, which was handled brilliantly by Jensen/ Jared. The two actors acted so well that they didn't know how to act that it was believable and kept me laughing for the duration of the scene. I haven't laughed like that since Will Farell was having a heartfelt convo in a fish suit with his basketball team in ""Semi-pro.""

All in all, I would not say that this season was the BEST season out of the 6, but you can tell the producers were trying to approach season six a little bit differently than seasons 4 and 5, where nearly the whole season had apocalyptic feel. This one was more like - hm, things are pretty bad, but the brothers are having fun while they're trying to figure things out and get to know each other all over again. Don't get me wrong, this season has drama like the previous seasons, but it was refreshing to get away from the whole apocalyptic sense and see the brothers interact more leisurely rather than think the clock was always against them because...season 7 is gonna get REAL apocalyptic (BIG spoiler alert) with Castiel becoming god-like/ insane towards the end of season 6.",1316995200,2,2928,4.327868852459017
4149910,3,B003L77GGK,"Similar to many other avid SUPERNATURAL fans, I am a bit disappointed with Season 6.  I just finished watching the DVD set (which, by the way, is once again well produced: it has easy to navigate discs, great sound and picture quality, interesting special features, and a great cover photo -- love the snake crawling up Sam Winchester's arm) and I have to tell you it was an uneven ride. As other reviewers have noted, the first 17 episodes are very scattered. Some are excellent while others, like ""The French Mistake"" are just plain bad. Taking Sam and Dean and placing them on the production stage of SUPERNATURAL takes the viewer out of the mythology and erodes the integrity of the characters for a bit of cheap self-adulation by the production staff.  The introduction of the Campbell cousins opened up some new possibilities for story archs, but the writers/producers/whoever decided to squander that by rapidly dispatching them in short order. (Bright spot: once dead characters return to life all the time on the show, so maybe we haven't seen the last of the Campbell cousins.) One episode has Dean Winchester running away like a scared little boy from a man who is following him. The next episode he's bad-mouthing a monster and staring him down. It's these types of character inconsistencies that have to leave us SUPERNATURAL fans scratching our heads and asking: ""Why?""

On a more positive note, as with previous seasons, the acting overall is very good. Jim Beaver remains a true gift to the show and Jensen and Jared remain as charismatic as ever. The last five episodes I really liked. They helped to restore my faith that this show can continue to be great, although whether or not the character of Castiel is being developed wisely remains open for debate. Despite what I see as some weaker moments in Season 6, SUPERNATURAL is still a noteworthy show that manages to capture the imagination of its audience. It is worth adding to your collection. Hopefully Season 7 will see the boys returning to what I consider the series traditionally stronger characteristics: consistently high quality episodes, great monsters, tight pacing, addictive storylines, and less calling for help to angels.",1316822400,13,2208,4.946091644204852
4149911,2,B003L77GGK,"I really hate to write a bad review of my absolute favorite show, but I don't have a choice.  Pretending things are all fine and well doesn't do anyone any good, and its intellectuality dishonest.

After the fans reacted to the tedium and poor casting choices of Season 3, there was a dedicated and phenomenal course change going into Season 4 that breathed a vibrant new breath of life into the series, and it thankfully dissolved the boring stagnation of black-eyed demons and Buffy-babe clones that was Season 3's unfortunate hallmark.  This welcomed renewal lasted until the finale of Season 5.  If you haven't seen Seasons 4 and 5, you need to watch it now!

Unfortunately the brilliance was short lived, and with Season 6 came the proverbial trainwreck.

I.  My first gripe is the overall writing.  Season 6 is filled with writers who wrote half-assed episodes using half-assed monsters that are a shameful parade of what this show used to be about.  In my prior reviews of Supernatural seasons, I said:

""The beauty of Supernatural for the first two years was it generally took lesser known monsters, urban legends, and other spooky stuff, and put a unique spin on it. The show would also introduce supernatural elements that were deliberately obscure, so if we didn't know about it from our own knowledge, we'd have to find out the details in real time with Sam and Dean. This kept things fresh by giving us a good mix of investigation and action.""

And:

""Another refreshing aspect of the show, is, it doesn't insult the audience. Existing horror conventions are borrowed, but almost all of them are updated into something new, as it successfully blends the insider info found in cult shows with the broader appeal of horror and action for the more mainstream audience. What we get is a hybrid of the two.""

Unfortunately Season 6 throws all of that away by giving us some of the most boring, rehashed, and lazy episodes to date.  This season was also plagued with pointless monsters.  For example: Did we really need several more episodes about vampires---perhaps the lamest and most overused monster in pop culture next to zombies?  What, in six seasons did the show run out of monster ideas?  What, there weren't enough monsters in mythology world-wide so they had to go back to the most stereotypical and highlighted monsters that can be found everywhere else?  Another trap the writers fell into was continuing to rip off other shows, but the acknowledging the original source material in-episode as if that clears them of lazy writing.  I mean, c'mon, the Supernatural writers have their own world to create with their own rules!  Why on Earth would they have to have insipid ""Anne Rice rules"" for vampires or ""Star Trek rules"" for mind-control worms?  At the very least, I'm thankful when they pointlessly brought in H.P. Lovecraft, they didn't have Cthulhu end up being the ""end boss"".  That would have been a stupid and monumental sell-out.

Along the same lines as above, I also have some issues with Sera Gamble, the replacement for Eric Kripke and the new creative head.  True to her name, her episodes are a gamble.  Like everyone, she has her pros and cons.  She is stunningly fantastic when she's writing the character of Death.  Her dialogue and plot writing for Death is solid gold.  But there-in lies the problem: she's a one trick pony, as most of the rest of her writing is dross.  Looking at all the episodes Gamble has written, she is perhaps the most uninspired and formulaic writer in the whole Supernatural stable.  With only a few exceptions here or there, too often her stories are just ripped off and repackaged plots tiredly taken from other sources.  The bottom line, is, I don't think she was the right choice to spearhead the show.  But Kripke seems to trust her, so maybe he sees something I don't.  Regardless, in the attempt to be fair, I'm still willing to give her a second chance with Season 7, but she has to step up her 'A Game' and get some new ideas to get this show moving in the right direction again.  Subpar or ""just ok"" episodes are not good enough, not when this show has been near-perfect in the past.

A final gripe I have about the writing, is: I wish certain writers would keep their damn politics out of the show.  [They know who they are.]  Neither political party seems capable of doing the right thing, and both are screwing us over.  But I don't need one side's particularly tiresome propaganda or slant shoved down my throat.  I tune into this show to escape all the b.s. political wrangling in the real world, so the last thing I want to see, is it crop up its ugly head in-fiction.  There is no place for that in the Supernatural, and it's just a stupid move on the part of the writers.  This country is literally divided 50/50, so it's beyond stupid to potentially alienate half of the audience just to throw in some snarky partisan politics.  If one wants to advertise their own political beliefs, they can do so on their own time.  We don't need that crap here, as this show should not be a vehicle for any petty politics.

II.  My second concern, is, this season started out very slowly and it needlessly ran us into several unnecessary dead ends that really didn't accomplish anything except waste our time, or kill off a few long-lasting guest star characters.  It also didn't seem to have a clear path.  The Purgatory arc might have been the overall plan, but it was painfully clear the first half of the season was just a shot in the dark by throwing anything and everything onto the wall to see what stuck.  And it was almost embarrassing watching each idea fail, and quickly be swept away.

One specific example was the absolutely worthless ""Grandpa Campbell & Cousins"" arc that utterly bombed.  I really like Mitch Pileggli and Colin Nemec, especially since they were both 'Stargate' alumni, but their talent was utterly wasted as one dimensional cardboard cut outs.  This was so painful and so pathetic, it even translated into the show inadvertently when cousin Mark becomes the first cannon-fodder casualty.  When he died, no one even batted an eye, no one said anything, and it was like he didn't even exist.  Ironic, as that's how I felt too!  There was not one ounce of character development given to Mark, thus his death had no more impact than swatting a mosquito.  [And the same mostly held true with the rest of the Campbell clan later on.]  For a show that sometimes tends to go overboard on the crying, whining, man-tears, and emotional roller coasters, I found it very disingenuous that no one would even care he died.  But more to the point, it was an example of poor writing.  The ""arc"" with Eve was just as bad.  Haphazard build up, quick resolution, and very little satisfaction because it was pretty clear in her final appearance that she was just shallow plot-filler and time-killer to get to the finale.

The most blatant and insipid travesty however, as the dreadful 'The French Mistake' episode that broke the fourth wall and tried to tell a story with the actors playing themselves.  It failed.  It failed miserably.  It wasn't funny, it wasn't clever, and it only severed as a lame and transparent self-indulgent piece for the crew that completely destroyed the suspension of disbelief.  'Wes Craven's New Nightmare' pulled the same stunt, but at least it tried to be serious.  Even 'Stargate SG-1' did a parody of itself, but that was both clever and funny.  The surname of this episode was aptly named.  It was a 'Mistake'.

III.  Third, it was even more apparent the show's budget is practically non-existent:  Almost no classic rock.  Almost no location shoots in the first half of the season and more ""we have to save money so all we can do is shoot in a warehouse or the studio backlot, and redress the sets over and over again and pray the fans don't notice"" than the first two years of the 'X-Files'.  This is fine with the running gag of the motel rooms, but it's not cool with full episodes.  A show that survived six seasons should be getting a bigger budget because it has proven itself capable of lasting, not the reverse by getting a smaller and small budget each year and sabotaging all that it had built up.  Then we have the monster farce: ""We don't have any money for special effects or monster costumes, so every monster including dragons will be humans with fangs or weird eyes to indicate different monster races.""  I mean c'mon, why even green-light a dragon episode when they couldn't do them to begin with?!  Yeah, like men in business suits really work as ""dragons""...  Boring!  That was a short cut the various Star Trek shows used, except in that case it was just regular humans with slightly different noses...

IV.  And finally, there's the pointless season finale.  Without giving away too much, it's just more of the same.  Of all the things they could do---of all the infinite possibilities of plot direction, the only thing they could think of, was to once again make us mistrust a good guy by seemingly turning someone evil.  Well yay...  Didn't we have to deal with that circular and done-to-death plot with Sam the last three years?  I mean c'mon, this is the best the show can come up with?  Drinking from the same well for the fourth time?!  And this was written by Kripke himself!  This endless farce of mistrust and corruption of the brothers or their allies is getting freaking old.  Been there, done that.  Ad nauseam.  Get some new material!  If the creative team or writing stable can't think of anything new for core character development, then they need to be replaced, or this show needs to end.  When I wrote my first review on Supernatural here on Amazon, I was floor by how brilliant it was, and I specifically mentioned how much I appreciated them taking their unique spin on things by being anti-formula.  But now I'm ready to drop the show---something unthinkable for me after the phenomenally good finale of Season 5, and I absolutely hate that I feel this way.  I love this show, I love the characters, and I love the idea behind it.  But man, they can do a helluva lot better than Season 6.

Taking into account all I said, this does not translate to the cast.  As usual, the acting is excellent, and I'm not at all criticizing them.  [Though with that said, it is high-time for Sam to get a hair cut!]  In fact, they were the only saving grace for me.  Sam, Dean, Bobby, and Cas were the only reasons I kept coming back to watch when I started getting disillusioned.

Yeah, this review was certainly a downer, and it pained me to write it.  But as I said before, with the bar having been set so high so early, I refuse to settle on anything less, and this season did not cut it.  It may be tolerable for fans of the actors or for more casual action/horror TV viewers, and that's cool.  But if you are a slightly more discriminating fan with a love of the show but no love for shortcuts or a drop in quality and presentation, this doesn't cut it.  Not by a long shot.  In fact, I can't even recommend purchasing this set, at least not until it drops in price.

To its credit, Supernatural has a history of taking into account fan concerns, and proactively righting a wayward course.  Hopefully things will get better in Season 7...",1316822400,20,11291,4.628082536487167

4149916,3,B003L77GGK,"Overall, I liked Season 6 and as I whole, I think it had more solid episodes than Season 5, which had the better overlying storyline.  I think that more time should have been given to Soulless Sam, although I sort of get why they cut it short -- while I like Jared P. as Sam, he is not the best actor in the world and moving him to lead over Jensen A. hurt the show.  As a result, we wound up with an abbreviated subplot rather than an arc that could carry the season.  Another mistake was the Lisa/Ben/Dean story.  Everytime you thought you had seen the last of Lisa and Ben, they just kept popping up for no particular reason, since it was clear to all from the second episode, that the relationship was over, and it seemed like the nail was finally put in the coffin with ""The Episode of Truth.""  It seemed almost as if the people in charge of the show liked the characters and could not let them go even though they made no inherent sense to the development of either the Dean character or the overall plot.  While I personally don't mind Dean actually having a love interest as a means of developing his character, in order for it to work the actors need to have chemistry together and Dean and Lisa did not. I also hate what was done with Castiel, but I am willing to reserve final judgment until this season before declaring that a bust.  The killing of Rufus was just wrong on so many levels as he added to the overall story every time he was on, and could have made a great companion/counterbalance to Bobby. I do however hope that the actor who played thee Alpha Vampire returns at some point because he was actually very interesting and well played.",1316304000,8,1660,4.318327974276527

The only problem I have is with the DVDs themselves. The scene selections are all screwed up. When you select one scene to watch for an episode, it brings you to a previous scene instead. My brother's Supernatural Season 6 DVDs have the same issue so I don't think it's an isolated problem. There are worse problems to have with the DVDs and all the shows run fine as far as I can tell. The scene selection issues are just annoying when you are just looking to watch your favorite parts of an episode.

Cass as God I'm not sure I buy; looks like he's being set up to Fall and become the next Lucifer. Hopefully the brothers get their respective acts together and save him from himself.

It seems like they truly did try to throw what ever they could against the wall & hoped it would stick unfortunately they tried to jump the shark a little too much,I liked the story line they had started going after with the Alphas & The mother of all but then they went no where with it just stopped after two or three episodes some of the 'Monsters' had good potential but were not given the proper justice they should have the Dragon episode is a great example I like the idea but hate how they presented it just a body of a human male with bat wings which were shown for a small glimpse they could have done a bit more for the dragon role,they didn't offer full creatures like were used to the Wendigo is a great example,Great looking creature in Creature form not a Human like the dragon & Phoenix I would have preferred to see something more as I know others would have liked to seen as well. I agree with many things other reviews have said about this season its not the best 7 I wish they would have stuck with the good thing they had. My fiance is a big supernatual lover as well who feels the same,He has made a comment they he wished he didn't waste our money on the sixth season he was ready to just turn it off a few times. Season six has some good points but over all was very disappointing,Wasn't anything I expected there were at least two episodes I wouldn't want to watch again & there's not really an episode I can say I truly loved I am not super picky I normally loved anything this crew does but I just can't stand behind season six.",1316044800,4,2026,4.1841432225063935

It makes me sad because I've always loved this show but I guess it's time to let go. I'll just be over here pretending it ended in season 5.",1315958400,12,456,4.573170731707317

That is what made S6 soooo perfect really.  It went back to its roots (just as Eric Kripke SAID the writers were going to do and do very well).  More monster of the weekish premise with a story arc to link it all up.  I thought the acting, writing, humor....ALL of it was spot on.  I could tell the writers ""got"" this series and stayed true to it.  I can't wait for S7!",1315958400,,529,4.067961165048544
4149933,4,B003L77GGK,"""Supernatural"" was always meant to be five seasons long so when the show was renewed for two additional seasons the five year plan that creator Erick Kripke had in mind went out the window and so did Kirpke who although is still a consulting producer (and wrote the season finale for season six)stepped aside and writer/co-producer Sara Gamble took the reins.

Although not as consistent as previous seasons ""Supernatural"" struggled to establish a consistent tone during the sixth season of the series. Nevertheless, the sixth season had a number of strong episodes including a couple of tongue-in-cheek classics written by writer/co-producer Ben Edlund (""The Tick"").

Introducing Sam and Dean's relatives as hunters was a great concept that wasn't developed as fully as it could have been; Sara Gamble and the other writers introduced a number of interesting characters including Sam and Dean's grandfather returning but didn't develop the characters as well as they could have. It's a pity because I think they could have built a couple of good episodes around the ""hunter"" family exploring their dynamic and relationship and eliminated a couple of the weaker episodes involving Sam & Dean's characters (or had them as peripheral characters much as they are in the episode ""Weekend at Bobby's"").

SPOILERS:

When we last saw Sam he descended to Hell with Luicifer's personna trapped inside him. Dean adopts a normal family life finding a peace he never had when he was raised. This lasts for a year but it seems like an eternity to Sam. When Sam mysteriously returns he lures Dean back into hunting but Dean finds Sam has changed--he's amoral and seems to delight in the torture of others something Sam would never do. Dean discovers that Sam has returned in body but he has no soul.

END OF SPOILERS:

The Blu-ray looks positively stunning--with a sharp, desaturated presentation true to the look of the original broadcast. Audio is presented in HD 5.1 lossless quality.

The extras include commentary tracks on Ben Edlund's amusing ""Clap Your Hands If You Believe"" and ""The French Mistake"" (by Edlund, producer Sara Gamble and director Robert Singer). The latter has an interactive trivia track for the Blu-ray.

We also get a featurette on Jensen Ackles turn behind the camera for ""Weekend at Bobby's""; the last two episodes for ""Supernatural: The Animated Series"" ""All Hell Breaks Loose"" parts I and II are also include; we also get outtakes/alternate takes for ""The French Mistake"".

The Blu-ray also includes ""The Hunter's Guide"" an interactive feature with exclusive featurettes on the production of the series buried within it. The special features are wrapped up with ""Supernatural: The Quest for the Soul"" a featurette on season six and the gag reel for the sixth season.

While season six was a bit uneven taking awhile to find it's footing, once the sixth season did discover the tone for the season there were a number of outstanding episodes. Part of that issue was due to the switch over in producers but the main reason was that the show was originally designed as a five season series.

4149934,4,B003L77GGK,"LOVE Supernatural, but I did not finish out this season on television. I kept forgetting to watch it, which meant I wasn't too thrilled about the season from the beginning. I am looking forward to finishing out the season as I have been told that it has a fantastic ending. I prefer to watch the episodes back-to-back anyhow when they come out on dvd. The waiting a week for each episode is truly torture. I hope for season 7 they bring back the ""sizzle"" the past seasons had. Although Padalecki's sizzle keeps getting hotter!!! :)",1315699200,,531,4.6
4149935,4,B003L77GGK,"I have to agree with a lot of people, this season wasn't as good as the others. Some episodes just sucked. That being said, there were a few episodes in this season that were awesome, and I still say they've got some of the best lighting/directing on TV. I wish they'd do a bit less of the world saving and more of the classic older-style monster hunting. For me, they started slipping in season five. Oh well, its still good TV compared to most of what's offered.

I just have one complaint about this season and its a writer complaint. Episode 21, Bobby is explaining to Dean who HP Lovecraft is and he says, ""At the Mountains of Madness, The Call of Cthulhu?"" to list some story titles Dean might recognize. Dean's answer is a questioning look and a dismissal. The writer missed the fact that Call of Cthulhu is also the name of a Metallica song. Dean, who frequently uses 'James Hetfield' as an alias, should have caught that and said something like, ""You mean like Metallica? Great song!"" Maybe have that song playing in the background at some point.  Tsk tsk tsk. Shame on you writer. Any time you mention a horror/fantasy title, cross-reference it with the metal music.",1315699200,2,1176,4.568720379146919
4149936,2,B003L77GGK,"The five year plan that Kripke had is over and you can tell.  This season had none of the backbone, the heart the other seasons had.  It is by far a miss compared to the first four season, back when I called this my favorite series.  I wanted it to be great, but each episode threw stuff at a wall hoping something would stick.  The heart which is the relationship of the brothers had failed.  They threw out the characters of Sam and Dean for unrecognizable doubles who forgot what made them different. What happened to Sam's powers.  I loved the Luke Skywalker/ Han Solo likeness of the first few seasons.  I loved when the boys where part of the mythos rather then powerless spectators.  Characters grow true, Sam was soulless but still this season just missed the target.  I hope the next season brings back the geeky Sam, the womanizing Dean and the heart of the series which is the brother wisecracking relationship.

Ben Edlund one of the best writers on television could not even put in a good episode.  So I hope they read the reviews and take some notes for S7.  They can still make a comeback and I am hoping they do.",1315612800,14,1128,4.422330097087379

Maybe I was skeptical from the beginning since I figured you can't get any bigger or worse than the devil. Although entertaining, it was all over the place. fairies? dragons? then they had this mother of all issue last maybe 1 1/2 episodes then it was gone! Also the chemistry seemed a little strained between Dean and Sam which I thought was hilariously pointed out in The French Mistake episode. All in all it was like Chinese food, I was hungry again in an hour for something more fulfilling.",1315612800,12,592,4.542056074766355
4149960,4,B003L77GGK,"Season Six of Supernatural marked the passing of the leadership torch from Eric Kripke to Sera Gamble, and it showed. I compare this season to watching a kid learning to ride a bike without training wheels. It started out pretty wobbly and uncertain, but as time passed it gained more confidence and momentum. Supernatural has always been rock solid, and even at its worst it is more worth watching than some other shows are at their best, so I am more than willing to forgive this season's stumbles.

Please note: this review does contain spoilers for season 6.

As a genre tv watcher for many years, I have learned that shows like this almost always suffer from the lack of a solid antagonist. This was what season 6 lacked the most. The ""Mother of All"" was a markedly lack-luster ""bad guy"" after having such deliciously nasty advesaries as the Yellow Eyed Demon and Lucifer himself in previous seasons. Additionally I thought the ""Alpha"" story-line failed utterly, and I think I sing along with the choir in having an intense dislike of the whole Campbell family angle - and that was introduced in a previous season. Having Sam and Dean come from a whole family tree of well respected hunters of evil was always a little too trite for me. That they were victims of tragic circumstance read better.

The stand-outs in season 6 could have been played up a little more. Soul-less Sam would have been a better heavy than half the Alphas and the Mother of All combined. Jared Padalecki brought on his A-Game to portray the cold, calculating Soul-less Sam. His performance was delightfully subtle when it could have easily been taken too far over the top. This subtlety made the character quite unnerving. I would have liked to have seen him stick around for a little bit longer, to give Dean more of a challenge as he picked away at the mystery behind his brother's odd behavior.

Another stand-out I'd like to see more of (because I can't accept the notion that he won't return) was the Alpha vampire. Forgive me for not knowing the actor's name, but the man was phenomenal, and his characterization of this ancient vampire couldn't have been better. He was positively chilling. Death returned in Season 6 too, and did not disappoint.

A quick note regarding the Ben and Lisa storyline - alot of fans disliked both these characters and Dean's relationship with them, but I did not. Seeing Dean's awkward attempt at domestication only underscored the underlying angst inherent to his character. As he will come to admit himself, he cannot have that life - ever. Supernatural will always be a dark tragedy, and to tell the truth I'm a little surprised Sera didn't kill either Lisa, Ben or both off completely. Somehow, though, I think knowing they are alive but untouchable may be more torture to Dean than if they'd simply died, so maybe Sera is more vicious than I'm giving her credit for here.

In conclusion, although I liked Soul-less Sam, the better part of season 6 begins roughly mid-season when the show actually starts to ""feel"" like Supernatural and not something just going through the motions. I myself tend toward the dark and angsty, but in this season the better episodes are those lighter offerings such as Clap Your Hands if You Believe, and the delightfully off the wall French Mistake. The writers and producers have described this season as ""noir"" and one of the best examples of that in my opinion (it's not a genre I know particularly well) would be Live Free and Twi-Hard. Not to be left off this season's best list is Jensen's directorial debut of Weekend At Bobby's. Though it's Sam and Dean light, Jim Beaver shows his chops and carries this episode with aplomb. It's fun, and witty, and who doesn't love it when Rufus Turner turns up? Oh, and did I mention Jensen directs? Ha ha!

And although I have nothing against Sera either as a writer or in her new role as head honcho, my absolute favorite episode of this season was the finale - The Man Who Knew Too Much penned by Eric Kripke himself. I felt as if he pulled together all the jangle and whine, tied up all the frayed ends left by some weak storylines, and paved the way to what could be Supernatural's best season yet. That is why despite its shortcomings, I still give season 6 a four star rating. People need to keep watching. I do not want to discourage anyone.

The boys have a lot left to do.",1315526400,7,4380,4.635309278350515
4149961,5,B003L77GGK,"My son and I have been fans of Supernatural from episode one and are impatiently waiting for the new season!  I have no idea how many times we've watched each episode, but Supernatural is our 'go to' when we want to watch something.  We were so engrossed in this last season(season 6), when the WB had advertised for a new episode and then at the last minute pulled it due to a scheduling conflict and aired a rerun of Nikita, you'd have thought it was the end of the world in this household!  I don't think I've ever looked forward to a series more in my life.  Supernatural is an exciting 'cross country joy ride' from beginning to end.  Season 6 is no exception to that. If anything, it amps it up a notch!  Supernatural is so engrossing, you don't watch it, you experience it.  (Kudos to the great writers-I laugh during every episode at Dean's quick witted but seriously delivered remarks!)  Supernatural is non-stop action, great dialogue and awesome music(thanks to Dean's taste in tunes!)  Buy and watch every season...you won't be disappointed!",1315526400,,1053,4.679347826086956

I was really excited for this season in the wake of the apocolypse and writing changes etc. However as the season started and went on I have to admit I was a little dissapointed. The whole purgatory and Eve story angle was intersting, but felt rushed and came off a little boring at times. Like others I will say towards the end of the season it did become a little more interesting and I am a interested to see how castiel's new role as a god will be developed. Overall this was a decent season, but pales in comparison to previous ones.

I loved seasons 1-5 and the ending to 5 was amazing. i wasn't sure how they were going to pick up season 6 but i was optimistic and while there was some potential at first the season quickly deteriorated into uninteresting schlock. the change in creative direction was obvious from the get to. a lack of the impala, less rock & roll, more touchy feely sensative crap. in a single season we had 6 or 7 ""elseworlds"" or ""what if"" episodes. i get it, once you've done the end of the world where do you go from there? but casting a mediocre looking actress as eve is a departure from the slew of beautiful babes that populated the series till now. killing her off so quickly really was a waste. the death of rufus was mostly useless and i was hoping for more from samuel. the original feel and humor is there it's just much more subdued than in previous seasons. though for the last 5 or so episodes, starting right about at the pheonix one, there is an upturn in quality and we see a very interesting plot twist at the end. so i'm actually really excited for the next season but this one i wasn't really impressed with. i'd go so far as to recomend a pass on it. don't bother with this one.",1315267200,6,1215,4.264069264069264
4149964,3,B003L77GGK,"Being a huge fan of Supernatural, I was really expecting a lot from season 6. But honestly, it was somewhat of a let down. Yeah, Kripke stepped down and his 5 season story arc ended, but I still thought that the writers would be able to come up with a more interesting--or at least consistent--story line. Besides some very good episodes towards the second half of the season, the season as whole was sporadic and repetitive. Some characters and items that were introduced as important just faded into the background or were just easily dealt with. Other than that and the sudden twist near the end, it was typical Sam/Dean mistrust and complications all weaved under the general theme of ""souls."" Nonetheless, I am looking forward to season 7 and hope that some of the old scary Supernatural feel returns instead of continuing on with this drama-filled and mundane trek it's gone on.",1314057600,7,884,4.784313725490196

Critics have called it messy, all over the place, unfocused, etc. All of that is true. Every season of the show has had a few episodes that missed the mark. However, Season 6 had about four to six that were really weak. It definitely picks up steam toward the end of the season, but so much potential was squandered early on. I didn't mind that Dean Winchester found a temporary love interest, but his role in the season seemed under written. It was like his job was to spend most of the time reacting to Sam Winchester's return from hell, Sam's changed personality, Sam's loss of his soul, Sam's need to get his soul back, and so on. Meanwhile, Dean's issues made up all of about four episodes, most of which felt forced and uneven. There were also some disappointing red herrings, including the ""Mother of All"" subplot that went no where slowly, and the ""Alphas"" subplot which started well, but never developed.
It wasn't a bad enough season to lose me as a viewer, but let's hope Season 7 doesn't turn out to be another year of Dean reacting to Sam's problems.",1313452800,8,1169,4.518867924528302
4150011,2,B003L77GGK,"Supernatural originally caught my attention with new spins on classic creatures, original ideas, and surprisingly artistic approaches to every aspect. As the show went on and the plots came together, intensity grew and finished in a season five finale that closed up the five-season story arc in a satisfying way.

As a fan from the beginning, I was curious to see where the show could possibly go after an ending like that in season five, and was met with disappointment. I gave the show a fair shot, but I just wasn't as captivated by season six.

The story-lines were all over the place, the entire plot seeming to take a completely different direction by the end. Many things even seemed to contradict things we were told from the beginning. There was a lot of emphasis on the brothers' relationship that seemed to be there more for the fans than for the show itself.

My opinion will probably differ from the majority, but Supernatural is not what it used to be with this season. There are still some familiarities, what with the witty banter and the action, but it seems to be filled with little nods to the fans, which is a good thing, don't get me wrong, however they detract from the show and make even a sci-fi/fantasy show slightly unrealistic. Unexpected twists have turned into predictable endings. To some this show is better than ever, but to me it's fallen in quality, and can't really beat the original arc.",1313107200,16,1424,4.688

Yet it is still here - six seasons and renewed for a seventh. The reason? It is a great show; brilliantly acted, brilliantly written, great stories. It is made by a tight team in front and behind the cameras, and even after 6 years they still care about making a quality show.

This season has a different feel to the earlier seasons, but maintains the quality we have come to expect. The storyline twists and turns and takes you places you never thought it would go. And it has some of the best eps of the show ever; the hilarious The French Mistake, Dean and Sam go to the old west in the great fun Frontierland, we get an excellent Bobby-centric ep directed by Jensen Ackles, the moving and wonderful Like a Virgin (including the best scene the show has had for 2 or 3 years), and many, many more.

4150061,4,B003L77GGK,"I was going to give it only three stars till I viewed the finally episode (which was really good). This has to be Sam's best  & Dean's worst season, in my opinion. Soulless Sam is well written & well acted. Sam always had a menacing side to him & this season really capitalizes on that. Dean however lost all his humour & became really whiney. Dean used to be wise cracking, fun & perverted. Now he just whines all the time. What happened to the bromance? They killed that part of the show. Cass becomes a ""cooler"" character, which is welcome. Mark Sheppard is always a plus for the show (any show really).

Season 6 only gives a few fun filled filler episodes which have fun with the characters, but these are weak compared to years past.  Another thing missing is the Classic Rock Sound Tracks, guess they needed to cut costs. That was as much a part of the show as the Impala. Who could ever forget the Groundhog ""Heat of the Moment"" episode.

You can tell the writers where going through the motions in 75% of the season. Just mediocre writing with little feel of the little details that made the show excellent. I like the idea of guest writers, like Stephen King taking a crack at this next season. I only hope it does not turn out to be a big spider in the end!

Overall I recommend it for fans who has seen the rest of the series, but in no way would this be a good place to start. Soulless Sam & Cass makes it worth the money.  Dean should of stayed at home this season.",1306368000,19,1479,4.245551601423488

I have no idea what went on in the writers' room but I have a feeling that what was written on paper came off better than what was shown on screen. Not only that but this season had more new writers who clearly had never written for the show before.

The result was a combination of new characters and story lines that while interesting never seemed to go anywhere. Not only that but some of the actions of the characters just seemed blown way out of proportion for the sake of dramatic tension and not much else.

Not only that but one of the main characters undergoes such a drastic transformation in the finale that it just seems so OOC. I could understand this development better if it was done in a gradual manner that was built up all season but this didn't happen so the resulting actions just seem rather forced.

Now I know some fans of Supernatural will disagree with me but that's fine with me. I feel like I gave this show a chance to impress me more than once so I can't be too disappointed when it doesn't. It just means that's time for me to move on to something better.",1306195200,23,1335,4.219607843137255

Half the cast being killed off

The start of S6 is a complete and utter mess. It's like, Sera or whoever just couldn't figure out what to do with it and so the season felt off and was scattered. Plus I don't even know what the main storyline for this season is supposed to be about since there's just so many options for that, most of which, just haven't been talked about. IMO, it was better with Kripke.

HOWEVER,

Around the second half of the season {which the exception of 'The French Mistake' which was awful except for the few bits that were actually funny} it does get better and starts to get a good flow and with that said, I'm hoping that if there is an S7, that it's done better because S6, at the end of the day, was a failure and not worth paying big dollars for unless you get a gift with it.

I was disappointed with S6, I thought it had a chance to be amazing and it wasn't. The only thing that can save it is the last remaining episodes.",1303084800,20,1073,4.297029702970297

4150104,5,B003L77GGK,"I have been watching Supernatural since the show started in 2005.  Its the only show on televison of its kind and it has become my all time favorite.  Supernatural blends together seamlessly the sci-fi, horror genre with healthy amounts of drama and sarcastic comedy weaved in thats is very unique.  The action is in my opinion feature film quality and the monsters this season are to die for ranging from djinns, to shape-shifters, vampires, faires, dragons, demons and the Mother of All baddies, Eve from Purgatory.  We are still waiting to see how the Mother of All mystery continues to unfold, but so far its been wild.

In season six you will get to see Sam's dramatic struggle over his very soul while dealing with the introduction of the Campbell family.  Dean's couragous attempts to help his brother while dealing with his own family drama with Lisa and Ben.  The first episode directed by Jensen Ackles all about great supporting character Bobby Singer called Weekend at Bobbys.  Along with all that you'll get to see Sexy Sammy shirtless in Third Man, Dean getting abducted by fairies and turned into a vampire, the first Old West episode where Winchesters finally meet Samuel Colt the maker of the very special Colt gun the boys used, and a super hilarious meta episode where Sam and Dean enter the real world of Jared, Jensen and Misha the actors behind the scenes of this great drama.

Yet, still at its core continues to be the relationship between Sam and Dean, especially in episodes like the premiere Exile on Main Street or Like A Virgin.  That is what you will find the most thrilling is after all these two boys have been through over the years the Winchester brothers chemistry is undeniable and unbreakable.  It will have you begging for more.  I definitely want to see a Season 7.

The brothers are modern day cowboys with stunning good looks and even better acting talent to boot especially when you add in the incomparable Jim Beaver as the loveable grumpy Bobby Singer and the endearing Misha Collins  as the confused angel Castiel you have a team free will that can't be stop.  Not to mention they ride around in the coolest Metallicar on the road a black 1967 Chevy Impala it would make the General Lee jealous lol.  Overall, Supernatural Season 6 is Back In the Saddle Again with enough crazy angst ridden adventures to keep you guessing where the show will go next.",1302048000,67,2396,4.709832134292566

It's enough to believe that there really are two brothers fighting out there to keep ""the evil sonuvabitches"" out. I've even got a  couple friends into the series.

This of course is still decently believable seeing as angels were as unreal as faeries and dragons when they first ran into them as well.

And in between or during this new Sam, you have them still fighting the good fight against all kinds of creatures. not as much fighting or killing demons. I would like to see more of that. there are a lot of story lines they have to tie together before the season ends, like dean and his girlfriend, Lucifer, heaven vs hell, angels having lost faith, but the biggest story line that is going to be all season long and that is who is Sam? the humor is still there.

You have the big dysfunctional family fall out after the boys lose Mary and John goes absolutely bats*** crazy Hunting for the ""Yellow Eyed Demon"". It amazes me that Dean is still the strong one, even after everything he has had to do and put up with all for Sam. When they switched things up and added in the Angels, especially Castiel (Misha Collins) I was blown away!  He still keeps us all guessing, especially about himself and Dean, plus that ""special"" relationship, The link that still ties them together ever since he yanked Dean out of Hell. I cried when Dean died, I cried when he came back and I totally lost it at the end of Season 5 ""Swan Song"". I was so upset when Lucifer snapped Bobby's neck and that assshat snapped his fingers to kill OUR Castiel.

When Chuck is seen at the beginning of that Episode writing about the Impala, Dean's one true Love, we all grabbed tissue boxes and settled in for what we knew was going to be one Amazing episode. The final shot of Sam and Adam falling into that swirling vortex to hold Lucifer and Michael, Dean's broken and shattered heart as he kneels staring at the spot where he lost HIS Sammy. Chuck all clean and leaving us ALL wondering when he just disappeared, Was he really God?

Season 6 has been strange to say the least. As a community, us Fans have been reserving judgment until we see the whole package. It's all about the whole package. We will keep watching even if (God forbid) this is the last Season, and hold out hope that we see more of Castiel as he fights Raphael for Heaven , I want to know more about the ""Missing"" Heavenly objects. Maybe then I'll be happy, until the Season ends I WILL keep watching.

This episode was so great and different, especially the opening sequence. The fact that UFO's and Fairies were involved had me hooked regardless of how they did it.

What my husband said is this is the only horror genre that attempts to maintain a logic.  Dizzy girls don't (usually) follow a bloody killer deeper into a dark and scary house or forest while screaming and shaking. The series tries to maintain an internal logic and set of physics logic for the alternative worlds the mere mortals engage in and they even leave room for things they don't know -- telling a ghost they don't actually know where the ghosts go after they salt and burn the bones.

4150213,5,B003L77GGK,"""Supernatural"" continues its winning formula of humor, actions and spooky plots, but throws new developments and new problems into season 6.  Dean has developed roots and a sense of paternal responsibility; Sam is carefree, reckless and perhaps not quite himself.  But both brothers are fantastic to watch, and the return of Castiel, whose ""people skills"" are ""rusty,"" brings more mystery and intrigue to the table.",1286668800,,415,5.369230769230769
