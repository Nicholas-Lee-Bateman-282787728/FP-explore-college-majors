6912968,4,B00R8N1DGM,Videos like this are super helpful when building better sleep habits (for me at least). According to the literature it's good to avoid extra stimulating media and especially avoid content with human faces as you try to wind down and send your body the message it's time to sleep soon.,1430784000,,284,4.7
6912969,5,B00R8N1DGM,Exactly what I've been looking for to help me fall asleep ... dark images and white noise ... perfectly blended ... well done.,1426464000,,126,4.521739130434782

6912971,2,B00R8N1DGM,"I generally like the Window Channel videos, but not this one. I realize it's to help with sleep problems, but I found the picture quality to be lacking - I couldn't really see much beside an overexposed moon and a sliver of the shore. This COULD have been a good video, and is an excellent idea,  but it could have been done better.",1421193600,,332,4.26984126984127
6913012,5,B00R8N1DGM,"I use this to help me sleep during the day, because I don't sleep at night. It's by far the best I've seen on Amazon. In less than 5 minutes I'm fast asleep. Love it!",1476921600,,166,3.7714285714285714

6913040,2,B00R8N1DGM,I doubted the bad reviews until I turned this one on. Do people find the sound of cicadas peaceful? OMG Those things used to keep me awake as a kid and this just gave me flashbacks of being 10 years old and unable to sleep because of those insects outside my window all night.,1470528000,2,276,4.12962962962963
6913041,5,B00R8N1DGM,"This was the BEST movie ever for confusing children who won't let you sleep because they wanna watch a movie. I put it on for my kid & tormented her with, ""no no... just wait, it's gonna get REAL good, just hold on..."" over and over again. Then I'd use the skip ahead 10 feature and say, ""Maybe now it'll get good..."" click... click... click... Complete confusion and semi-sleep was never so good.",1470355200,4,397,4.4520547945205475

6913112,5,B00R8N1DGM,"If you have trouble falling or staying asleep, try putting this on. It's a wonderful mix of all sorts of night sounds like waves and crickets.

6913115,5,B00R8N1DGM,One of the best overall sleep and meditation programs.  Its over 3 hours long so you don't have the reset situation that you have with other programs.,1468540800,,150,4.555555555555555
6913116,1,B00R8N1DGM,Poorly made. Short low rez video poorly scaled up to HD looks out of focus is looped so the moon doesn't move. The so called white noise that starts off sounding like crickets after a while can't be discerned from freeway traffic noise.  couldn't sleep thinking of how I could make a better video with my cell phone during my next camping trip.,1467590400,,344,4.4603174603174605

6913144,2,B00R8N1DGM,Insect noises are too dominant. The only reason I try and use it is because it's free. The best one is the three hour rain but I can't afford it.,1466812800,,145,3.8666666666666667

The audio: They're crickets but after a while they sound like sleigh bells. Tiny little bells. Honestly, they're not too bad if I turn the sound down very low.

The visual: Watch the trailer. See the moon in the middle? Well, it is NOT dark. It is a like a flashlight in your bedroom. It is quite bright. If you like darkness (not totally dark) this will annoy the heck out of you. The way the video cycles, the clouds never cover it so it is continuously bright.
