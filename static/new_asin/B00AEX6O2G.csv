8550695,5,B00AEX6O2G,"The title to this video explains itself. It really is pretty sweet. The gnarliest video I've seen so far. Once you see the intro you'll be hooked. The visual effects are amazing.
The soundtrack is also rad to the max. You've got anywhere from J.U.S.T.I.C.E. to Fits and the Tantroms. Everyone shreds in the video too. It has lots of good video parts from the skaters. With some star cameos. Its by far the best video EVER.",1380585600,,422,4.4935064935064934
8550696,5,B00AEX6O2G,"Girl Skateboards did it again, as always Girl SB is a step ahead in skateboarding movies, they did it with ""Yeah Right"" and now they managed to did it again. Great movie, fun to watch, great team, great tricks.",1375747200,,210,4.410256410256411
8550697,4,B00AEX6O2G,"Another Girl Films production at its finest. It seems that this production team seems to out-do themselves each time with each new release. Pretty Sweet on Blu-ray is amazing to watch, crystal clear clarity. ""Yeah Right!"" ""Fully Flared"" and ""Hot Chocolate"" are recommended to complete this collection.",1374624000,,301,5.425531914893617
8550698,3,B00AEX6O2G,"This video is still very good compared to the standard skate video, but doesn't meet the exceptionally high standard set by their previous videos (Girl/Chocolate). Also I was sad to see Mike Carroll retired, but that's how it goes. Thanks for all your hard work, Mike. Best of luck!",1368489600,,282,4.775510204081633
8550699,5,B00AEX6O2G,Great footage and some amazing skaters.  The Marc Johnson part is ridiculous.  The guy can do it all barely needs to lift his hands above his waist...SMOOTH.,1363910400,,157,4.777777777777778
8550700,5,B00AEX6O2G,"defiantly is one of the best skate video's i have seen in awhile, i almost would say best skate video of 2012 in my opinion",1356912000,4,123,3.96
8550701,2,B00AEX6O2G,"The special effects and video production in this film are phenominal and entertaining - especially on Blu Ray.  Although this edition says DVD I believe it comes with both a DVD and a Blu Ray disc of the film (at least mine did).  The soundtrack is pretty good with varied genres including classic rock, contemporary rock, old school hip hop, and punk.  The actual tricks and locations in the video get pretty monotonous after about 30 minutes, but it's still pretty good.  It could have used more pool skating and maybe some ramp skating along with all the street skating since there are only so many variations of kickflips and heelflips that you handle watching for 1 1/2 hours.

I started skating back in 1984 and still skate when I can, so I've seen enough skate videos to understand that foul language is kind of ""to be expected.""  I was not surprised that the ""f"" bomb was dropped a number of times throughout the film, but the first spoken word in the video is the big ""f"" and it is said a few times within the first few minutes of the film.  The soundtrack has some songs with explicit lyrics as well.  Then there is the scene where Jack Black takes off all his clothes and runs around.  Yes, he has his hands covering his genitals, but it still leaves NOTHING ELSE to the imagination.  Finally, when we were watching the bonus content a scene pops on where a young woman is holding a very large ""self pleasure device"" in the shape of male genitals (yes, I know what it is called but I'm trying to keep this review family friendly).  I had the video muted at that point so I did not hear what she said about the device, but it may have been sexually explicit.

So, although this video is one of the hottest skate videos of the year, parents be warned - you may not want your child viewing some of the content and hearing some of the language in the film.  I would have given it a 4 1/2 to 5 star rating if it did not include some of this content.",1356825600,11,1955,4.308743169398907
