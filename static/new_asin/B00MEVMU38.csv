6575637,5,B00MEVMU38,"I bought this directly from Rifftrax and it's one of their very best. I've watched a lot of these with my girlfriend and this was one of our favorites, if not our very favorite. A great one to start with for people looking to get into the series as it's one you'll probably want to watch more than a couple of times.",1430092800,,316,4.112903225806452
6575638,5,B00MEVMU38,If you like. This kind of thing and I do you will love this one it is so bad. First there is this p. I. from Harlem hence the title. Who is called the Guy from Harlem as if it's. His name but does. It take place in new York. Nope. It's. In Florida his first case is to protect an African queen while. Her husband is busy so while saving her from getting killed he makes time. To sleep with her. Next he looks for s gangsters daughter. Who by the way talks way too loud. For no reason the Father. I mean the fight. Scenes. Are a joke I highly.reccommend funny theme song riffed by the guys.,1430006400,,589,3.957983193277311
6575639,5,B00MEVMU38,"Oh my goodness where do I start?  This is your typical blaxploitation film from the 70s and the riffing is stellar!!!  There's so much to poke at, I'm sure they had a hard time editing themselves.

Our teenage kids watched it and they kept asking, ""Is this for real?""  They couldn't believe someone would or could make a movie this bad and offensive.  We also watched this with friends from high school who are not fellow Mystery Science fans and even they were laughing their butts off!  This is one of the better Rifftrax movies - and I have all of them.  If you love Rifftrax & MST2K get this one!",1424822400,,600,4.351351351351352

6575643,5,B00MEVMU38,"""The Guy From Harlem"" is the first Blaxploitation film that RiffTrax has ever done, and it's a gem. I've seen plenty of films from this genre (oh how I wish RiffTrax would do ""Black Shampoo,"") but for just plain terrible acting and the most blown lines per running minute, this film may be the worst they have ever done. I was absolutely astonished by the number of lines that were either never memorized or were totally blown but not reshot. Ed Wood would blanch.

The movie itself involves the Guy From Harlem, Al Connors (Loye Hawkins,) a man who is so good at protection that when an African queen (or princess, or wife of a head of state...I don't know; her title changes about every five minutes) is brought to the country, the CIA, which doesn't feel up to the task, subcontracts her security out to Al. You know Al's the best when you see the orange shag carpet on his floor and the inconspicuous red Cadillac he drives, but he has something of a reputation with the ladies (of course,) so there's that angle going on too. Now you might think that since Al is the Guy From Harlem, that this movie would take place in New York. You can be excused for that bit of navet&eacute;, but it all is set in Miami. (Ponder.) There is a subplot about local mob boss Harry De Bauld's (Steve Gallon) daughter being kidnapped and the film seems to lap itself at some point in all the confusion. Afros and outstanding clothes are on conspicuous display and the dialogue and plot twists are loopy and sometimes almost incomprehensible, but ""The Guy From Harlem"" delivers big laughs from the RiffTrax crew. Recommended for Blaxploitation, MST3K, or RiffTrax fans everywhere.",1417046400,7,1665,4.625
6575644,5,B00MEVMU38,"While not all of the movies riffed are gold, some do stand up really well, and this is one of them. I had a number of laughing out loud moments, and the movie's so awful there's never any real dead spots (I found the Night of the Living Dead had some due to the movie's pacing). Luckily this movie,while having tons of boring dialogue, it's often unintentional hilarious. (At one point someone says no has seen Character X. In the next sentence he then goes on to give a lengthy detailed description of every physical characteristic about Character X, then ends with 'No one's ever seen the guy."" . Even the RT crew are in awe. Explanations are about to happen, then never occur, though the cast acts like someone did a page by page dissertation on War and Peace. And the flubbed lines. Oh lord, it really is the worst. Luckily it's made watchable, and even perversely enjoyable, by out intrepid crew.

It's only about an hour twenty or so, but the bonus is a 'roundtable discussion' (a la Talking Dead), where the cast breaks down the 'best' moments of the movie. Some might find it redundant to the movie, but some of it is so purely awful it's amusing to see them revisit the awfulness of it.

I paid the full 10 and felt it was money well spend.",1414627200,7,1249,4.402597402597403
6575645,5,B00MEVMU38,"According to Mike Nelson, this is the first blaxploitation film that he, Kevin Murphy and Bill Corbett, have ever riffed.  To my knowledge, it's also the first film they've riffed that includes profanity, and some semi-sexual scenes.  The worse the movie, the funnier the riffs, and this movie makes Ed Wood look like Orson Welles by comparison.  The actors, including Al Connors (Loye Hawkins), the Guy from Harlem, barely know their lines, and constantly keep talking over each other.  Harry De Bauld (Steve Gallon) is constantly yelling his lines, even when his character is supposed to be conversing normally.  He makes a point of telling Al that he has two reasons for seeing him, and then only gives him one reason. From the colorful leisure suits and shag carpeting, it's obvious that this movie was made in 1977.  The sets of this low, low budget movie are so bad, Bill comments that the Guy from Harlem looks like he's ""working in the spare room of a weird Church basement.""  What makes this movie extra special is the fact that Mike, Kevin and Bill give a brief introduction to the movie.  They also return in the bonus feature ""Talkin' RiffTrax,"" to discuss the movie at length.  This is one of the funniest RiffTrax releases I have ever seen, and I've seen a lot of them!",1410220800,20,1283,4.691964285714286

I was NOT expecting to see & hear what I did from the movie itself and the silly commentary. The bad acting, the fight scenes and the plot was insanely hilarious, I absolutely loved it!",1507766400,,328,4.377049180327869
6575650,4,B00MEVMU38,"Perfect movie for RiffTrax to do. The Guy From Harlem is BAD.  Not with the character being a Bad dude but in being a amazingly bad movie.  No edits or corrections due to bad line readings or we will just add the stunts later and never getting around to it bad.  Shot in about 4  locations bad.
Makes Ed Wood look like Scorsese bad, Troll 2 look like The Exorcist,The Room look like the Godfather, any Troma movie look like a Academy Award Winner bad.  Can't name any country from Africa bad.  Drop you intelligence points bad.  Did I mention the movie is bad because if not I will say it again.  It's bad.  Fortunately the Rifftrax crew does an amazing job with this.  My personal favorite is the ""added"" lyrics to the theme song.",1505779200,,731,4.348148148148148

6575658,5,B00MEVMU38,"This 1977 actioner is an insult even to the condescending term Blaxploitation.  For no reason we can think of except lack of plot and planning, it actually consists of two girl-under-guard stories with no connection.  Our hero, Al Connors (Loye Hawkins) first is tasked by the CIA(!) with protecting an African Princess who is the wife of an African head of state, although the lady speaks with a distinct Detroit accent.  (As is typical of the lameness of this movie, the actors tried to clear up that major loophole with dialog but even that was a botch.)  After that plot stream ends (I cant say resolved because it wasnt), he goes after the local white Big Daddy drug kingpin (Wayne Crawford, confusingly billed as Scott Lawrence), who has kidnapped a minor drug kingpins daughter for no reason we know of.  The minor pin pays Connors with a key of cocaine and $10,000 in cash which he pulls from the apparently limitless pockets of his loud checked suit.

THE GUY FROM HARLEM is a film where fighters on the ground roll over before simply reaching for their guns and are shot without visible blood, where one character botches line after line without retakes, and even the stereotyped Wa-Ka-Cha pseudo-soul music of the period gives way to sounds that resemble a Seventies video arcade.  Happily, our RiffTrax gang has a fine time skewering all this, from the fact that the Man from Harlem lives in Miami, to his secretarys desk which looks like it was stolen from an eight-year-olds bedroom, to the unnecessary and probably accidental crotch shots (Male camel toe!  NOOO!) and other such not-so-niceties that makes this flick such a howler.  (Even the pineapple rings that used to signify a reel change to theater projectionists appear to have been DRAWN on.)  Fortunately, most of the cast didn't quit their day jobs or went on to other fields.

Note:  The RiffTrax version of this movie clocks in at an hour, fifty-four minutes, while IMDb shows the original release time as 1:56.  I have been told that the two minutes were cut out to delete a rape scene and some nudity during the massage scene.",1486857600,4,2105,4.765840220385675

6575684,5,B00MEVMU38,"This movie is amazing. It's basically the same plot that happens twice. Totally uninteresting dude (from Harlem) takes up a job to protect an important afro'd woman. What's bizarre is that the first time it's the wife of an African nation's prince, it's about a third of the movie, and he's protecting her from assassins, kidnappers, or something of the sort. Then for the remaining two thirds, he's saving the daughter of some aggressive local drug lord who has just been kidnapped. That's right, just kidnapped and held for ransom, so it's clear she's safe, unlike the less certain situation with the African princess.

So basically it's like if there was a Batman movie where Batman took on and fought the joker for the first act, and then the latter two acts were Batman vs Egghead or Batman vs Kiteman. Like I said, amazing.

The riffing in this is on point, but what makes it truly hilarious are the fight scenes. Watch closely for a man who rolls on the ground while trying to grab a gun for no reason. Perhaps the most pathetic element of the film is how there are NO TAKES. People mush up and run over their lines constantly, stumbling over their dialogue. It's like watching a poorly-choreographed and unrehearsed middle school play, only it's about a guy from Harlem. Definitely check this out.

Weirdly memorable performances and some of the best fight choreography I've seen since my friends and I re-enacted Bruce Lee movies in the fourth grade.

6575728,5,B00MEVMU38,"So glad that Amazon has picked these up and put a few free to stream with Prime. REALLY enjoyed this particular riff and hope more come. The Guy From Harlem has the ineptitude of Manos: The Hands of Fate yet doesn't contain the ambition. It's bad and so obviously reliant on the first take that it's actually hard to watch because you feel so bad for the filmmakers. But having Mike, Kevin, and Bill riffing it makes it oddly soothing. A great riff to be sure.",1469577600,,460,4.3604651162790695

6575730,2,B00MEVMU38,Not at all well done. The jokes aren't funny and they wouldn't and couldn't do borderline racist jokes lest they offend anyone.

6575748,5,B00MEVMU38,"This movie is one of those gems that makes me proud to be an American.  What other country could someone make a living simply off of where he or she was born?  The USA, that is where.  The Guy from Harlem isn't just the hero we want, he isn't just the hero we need, he is the hero we deserve.  From the outset of the film it is clear a statement is being made.  Seeing Guy tool around in a gas guzzler on his way to his totally above board professional office tells the viewer to sit the F down, the Guy from Harlem is here.  Whether he is sniffing for gristle laden steak, or sexually harassing the wife of an African president (while in the presence of his girlfriend.  Wait, in his girlfriend's apartment, for that matter, which he is asking her to leave) the Guy has all the right moves.

America was a much safer place with the Guy from Harlem on the case.  I am not sure if he is still around, and since the movie takes place in Miami, not Harlem, he may be hard to find, but I would sleep a lot better knowing the Guy is still out there.

And hats off to the Rifftrax crew.  This is another example of a film I would never have heard of without their riffing it.  Mike Nelson, Kevin Murphy, and Bill Corbett are masters of this style of comedy.  I have many very funny friends, and love watching films with them but the synergy, precision, and outright hilarity these three bring to their work is amazing.  I have attended numerous live events and every time I introduce someone to rifftrax at first their impression is anyone could sit around and rip a film to shreds.  After a while, however, everyone I have turned on to rifftrax realizes the astounding ability these three have at creating what amounts to a head on collision between a bad film and impeccably timed razor sharp commentary that is in no way cynical, which is no small task.

The Rifftrax crew truly shows their wide array of talents on this gem.  The interplay is brilliantly orchestrated and the jokes are comedy gold.  This film is so bad I hesitated to view it.  For years I thought this film looks so bad the Rifftrax crew was shooting fish in a barrel and that this was beneath them.  Man was I wrong.  It is like shooting fish in a barrel, but as the saying goes the devil is in the details, and Mike, Bill, and Kevin are all about the details in this effort.",1465171200,10,2342,4.26530612244898
6575749,4,B00MEVMU38,"The problem of making current riffing references, of course, is that the jokes become immediately dated. MST3K did an excellent job of mostly avoiding the contemporaneous, which makes those shows timeless. Here, there are a few too many ""current"" riffs, including a slam on the then (early 2014) pathetic Kansas City Royals, who are the current (2015) World Series champs. Still, a very funny rifftrax.",1459987200,,402,5.2
6575750,4,B00MEVMU38,"Where do these guys find these turkeys ? This is one of the most ""Blacksploitation"" attempts at moviemaking I have ever seen. The crappy fight scenes and rookie acting make it the deserving target for MST3K fans.

The laughs are rapidfire and most are spot-on hilarious.  But let's face it, this film is a gut-buster even without RT's overdubbed insults.  The title tune played over the opening credits made me laugh out loud.  It's hideously awesome!  Imagine a first grade student asked to listen to the theme from SHAFT, one time, and then try to copy the style & attitude... and what you'll hear is what they might have composed, only worse.  The rest of the film... well, it's honestly hard to believe it ever even got made. Did this ever see a legitimate wide theatrical release? Good lord, let's hope not. This movie must be seen to be believed, and even then you may think you only imagined it because, well... nothing could be THAT bad.

There is something about this awful movie that is more engaging than other ones, though I can't get my mind around what it is. And, it lends itself very well to riffing. It seemed to me that the Rifftrax crew enjoyed shredding this one, again I can't point to anything but it really seemed like they were having a good time, and that's fun. There were lots of LOL moments in this movie for me, which I watched at work so my co-workers had to sit next to me while I sat laughing with headphones on.
