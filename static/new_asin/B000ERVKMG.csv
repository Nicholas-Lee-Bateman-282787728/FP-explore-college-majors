2531149,3,B000ERVKMG,"If there is one cliche in the horror movie world that has without a doubt over-stayed it's welcome/over-run it's course it's the annoying G.I.JANE feminator(i'm gonna out muscle & out witt the killing machine monster even though it's 10 time my size & on a normal basis could snap the spine of your average size guy)character. Well in ""INCIDENT..."" Director Don Coscarelli pulls no punches when it comes to this crappy type of female she-ra character but between the very very creepy villain MOONFACE & the middle of nowhere atmosphere from the backwoods set,the pretty consistant tension that creeps & hides throughout,coscarelli manages to come out the other end of this (well under 60 minute) nightmare with a flawful but over all good contribution to the MASTERS OF HORROR series & with a few cool extras to boot makes this well worth 12$. But thats it! no more feminator's!",1147478400,3,878,4.899328859060403
2531150,1,B000ERVKMG,"Coscarelli's first Phantasm flick was a winner, no doubt about it, quite an accomplishment, but this flick here, this episode of Masters... simply does not work.

 First of all, the actors aren't very good (with the exception of the guy with the chrome teeth--borrowed from that Bond flick, no doubt) and we don't really care what happens to the chick or her a-hole boyfriend. So who is there left to root for?

The art direction seems to out-shine the series... That's pretty sad, though, isn't it, when all you can recommend is the art direction?

RE: Extras. Nifty. Admire the way Coscarelli created his own start in films; well, his dad raising the bucks for the initial effort didn't hurt him any, either.

Bubba Ho-Tep looks like fun. I might check it out.",1147478400,,762,4.6992481203007515
2531151,4,B000ERVKMG,"Don Coscarelli, who directed ""Phantasm"" and ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" directs this entry in the Masters Of Horror series. Taking the series to a much higher level is exactly what this short film does. This sticks out above all other Masters Of Horror series released so far. While you are watching ""Incident"" you get this feel from the film that this is something special and unique, unlike anything seen from the Masters series. You can tell this film is directed by someone with high skill as soon as you get 10 minutes into the movie. The acting is very convincing, and the monster/maniac looks very well made. Anytime you bring a monster into a film like this, it just makes the film so much cooler and scarier. Definitely check out this entry in the Masters Of Horror series, you can't go wrong with this disc.",1147392000,2,804,4.629370629370629
2531152,5,B000ERVKMG,"Don Cosarelli has delivered on his entry into the Master of Horror series.  He takes familiar elements; a lone driver on a deserted road, a dark appalachian-like back woods atmosphere, a deranged character to avoid at all costs, and breathes new life into them by creating a story with twists and turns that will catch you off guard.  He does so by regressing, very smoothly, at critical points to prepare you for the next transition. The story does not disappoint and you will find the introduction of Moonface into the world of the macabre a welcomed one. Look for Angus Scrimm, an unforgetable but familiar face from Phantasm.",1147305600,2,629,4.814814814814815

D: Don Coscarelli


Highly atmospheric and a narrative that is more interesting than your typical slasher fare. However, everything else is quite average.

Dance of the Dead
D: Tobe Hooper


A bleak and ambitious post-apocalyptic setting with a poor central plot. The film decides to play it safe and never lives up to its title but still worth watching for Robert Englunds show stealing performance and a certain memorable dumpster sequence.

2531308,5,B000ERVKMG,"Masters Of Horror is a great anthology series of mainly erotic horror episodes that aired on The Movie Channel back in 2005  2006.
All of these episodes were previously released as single issues, with lots of extra features, however, this set is only the bare-bones, 60 minute short films. This is a great value for the money, its about what you would pay for a single new movie released nowadays. You could also say that most of these movies are much more interesting than most of the horror movies produced over the last 10 years. The video quality is actually very good, considering its a Anchor Bay release. Note that the episodes are not in the same chronological order as when they were first aired.

The following is the episode guide for season 1.

A man searches for the last surviving print of a rare film which allegedly drove the only audience that ever viewed it into a fit of homicidal frenzy.

Disc 2

5 -Incident On And Off A Mountain Road
A young woman matches wits with a deformed and sadistic serial killer on and off a remote mountain road. Based on the short story by Joe R. Lansdale
6  Haeckels Tale
In the 1850s, a man on his way to his sick father in upstate New York, seeks shelter in a secluded cabin owned by a mysterious couple where he becomes involved in a grotesque orgy of the undead. Based on a Short Story by: Clive Barker
7  Jenifer
A police officer saves the life of a hideously deformed young woman, only to find himself drawn into a web of murder and self-destruction from which he finds it hard to break away. Based on a Short Story by: Bruce Jones.

Disc 3

8-Deer Woman
A police detective investigates a series of brutal murders which are committed by an ancient creature from Native American mythology

For the most part, I believe the series was a success.  For horror fans, these are stories that we would normally not be able to see, unless truncated versions were put together for an anthology movie or something.

I've lived with these episodes for awhile, and watched most of them a few times.  Most of them are really fairly good.  Even the ""bad"" ones aren't truly bad, they just tend to confuse a little, and you still want to rewatch it again.

While the second season wasn't as consistent, I'm still disappointed that they haven't released it in the US in a format other than the ridiculous skull box.",1473811200,3,775,4.5

The first purchase is by John McNaughtin entitled ""Haeckel's Tale"". I had read this many years ago and recognized the title immediately. The episode script is based on a Clive Barker short story, first published in the anthology Dark Delicacies: Original Tales of Terror and the Macabre. It reads like an antiquated story by M. R. James or Algernon Blackwood but was written for the anthology ""Dark Delicacies"", published in 2005.  The second purchase is my favorite of all of the episodes. It is entitled ""Chocolate"" and was written and directed by Mick Garris. I found the filmography to be beautiful and the story, itself, intoxicating.

2531544,4,B000ERVKMG,"In Vol. 3, we have three more tales.  In my eyes, they don't hold a candle to vol. 1, 2 & 4, but it's only a matter of degrees.

In Don Coscarelli's (Phantasm) Incident On & Off a Mountain Road, the best of the three tales we have a woman who crashes into another car in the middle of nowhere.  Very soon, she's discovered by a madman who hunts her and captures her.  To his chagrin, however, she's no mere damsel in distress.  She married a survivalist and was taught the ins and outs of how to maim and kill predators.  What evolves is a neat piece of work that pits a serial killer against a survivalist-by-proxy.  Just, whatever you do, don't call him Moonface.

Dance of the Dead features the ever-delightful Robert England as an MC to a post-apocalyptic nightclub that features, as its entertainment, both Billy Corgan AND zombies being cattle prodded to dance.  This passes for entertainment--well, that and huge numbers of deaths and rapes on the city streets.  Amidst this turmoil and carnage, love blooms, and a girl becomes a woman (not in a sexual way, just in a growing-up sort of way).  Not bad, but it really just didn't do much for me.

Lastly is Pick Me Up, starring Fairuza Balk and Michael Moriarty.  They had a good thing going, taking serial killing to the next level, with not one but TWO killers.  I'm not giving anything away there, it's right on the package.  I pretty much liked it, until the very end when the ambulance comes and picks them up.  That really went too over the top for me.",1376092800,2,1514,4.450909090909091

2531625,2,B000ERVKMG,"I bought this set after watching Haeckel's Tale's on Syfy one night because I was so impressed with the episode. I love and always will love HBO's ""Tales from the Crypt""  and I loathe the campy ""Tales from the Darkside"" series that is about as dark as the ""Amazing Stories"" series. So that is my personal aesthetic.

Yet after watching the full first season of Masters of Horror, I was completely let down. There are only a few noteworthy episodes in the season, and Haeckel's Tale is the best. I will however give it a star for exposing so many beautiful women's breasts, and it occurs in every episode.

""Dance of the Dead"" sounds like an exciting title and Tobe Hooper is a good director, at least for the first Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but this episode is god awful.

""Homecoming"" is thoughtful in a very lame self-evident sense, but brings terrible terrible shame to the zombie genre.

""Deer Woman"" is slightly funny, and the actress is amazingly hot, but the episode was a complete turd!

""Pick Me Up"" sounds interesting from the description, but not as clever and original as the description makes it sound, another failure.

""Dreams in the Witch-House"" is a decent one. Yet I do not think it is inspired by a Lovecraft short story - I believe the original story was written by a member of the Lovecraftian Circle named Henry Kuttner and the tale was ""The Salem Horror.""

""Incident on and off a Mountain Road"" is very similar to the film ""The Hills have Eyes 2,"" yet incredibly (if possible) isn't as good as said film - the film is Ed Wood bad, but will never inspire a cult following.

Jenifer is one I like, and funny considering Steven Weber from the sitcom ""Wings"" once again stars in a horror tale where he makes sweet love to a ghoul. The first time being in Tales From the Crypt episode ""Mournin' Mess"" in 1991.",1341360000,,1826,4.5426829268292686

2531663,5,B000ERVKMG,"Masters of Horror: Don Coscarelli: Incident On and Off a Mountain Road: 8 out of 10: In many ways fifty minutes is the perfect length for a horror movie. Incident certainly has enough plot for a full length feature, but this is a story broken down to its core elements without any unnecessary filler. (It has a bit of a Twilight Zone feel as a result.)

Masters of Horror is that wonderful Showtime series that has produced some great horror films and some guilty pleasures (in particular Clive Barker's Haeckel's Tale). Incident got this anthology series off to a very strong start.

The film is about a woman that has a car accident on a deserted stretch of rain soaked mountain road. She quickly finds herself perused by a serial killer (dubbed Moonface) who is busy chasing a previous victim. She turns out not to be the damsel in distress that we suspected, as she has had survival training from her boyfriend which the film doles out in flashback. It is also interesting as one can see the progression of her relationship with the boyfriend as it coincides her conflict with Moonface.

Director Don Coscarielli runs a tight ship with plenty of surprises in both plot and scope. The acting by all is above board with a particular nod to John DeSantis as the serial killer. Moonface, with his chrome teeth, baldhead and big shiny knife; he is such a quality villain that it seems a shame he is in such a small film. Moonface certainly could hold his own with the Jason's and Leatherface's of the world. In fact, he has that childlike quality that made Leatherface such an endearing character,. (Not to mention they share the same interior decorator.)

The gore is good, the set design is excellent and the movie is simply never boring. Add on a story with depth and layers and you have a very strong start to an excellent series.",1258761600,,1833,4.613496932515337

A young woman, Ellen (Bree Turner), gets stranded off a lone highway after dark. She notices another empty car nearby and decides to look for someone who can help her. She is greeted by a bloodied victim, still alive and her remarkably large predator. His name is Moonface (John De Santis). He is severely deformed, about 8 feet tall and armed with several sharp objects and not to mention possesses impressive acrobatic skills (His entrance on screen, when he leaps to view, is quite remarkable and frightening at the same time). Ellen does what anyone in fear of their life would have done, and scrambles to the woods hoping to lose this violent maniac, that is of course, until she decides not to be a victim any longer. Through several flashbacks, we find out Ellen is no weakling, she was trained by an obnoxious but shrewd soldier ex-husband (Ethan Embry) to ""expect the unexpected"" and ""do the unexpected"". He was able to teach her several survival techniques and through his teachings, Ellen is able to construct, using a limited time-frame (and suspension of disbelief) several booby traps in order to hurt or handicap the predator.

 This gem in the ""Masters of Horror"" series was directed by Don Coscarelli (""Phantasm"") and is one of the best offerings of Season 1. How can a horror tale be so predictable and yet so unpredictable? The story is clichd but several twists are thrown in to make the viewer say ""what the heck?"". To begin with, this isn't your typical damsel in distress. Our heroine (if you want to call her that) is a tough as nails, steely-faced babe with the heart and soul of a survivor. Yes, there are moments of her crying and screaming, as anyone in her situation would be but after taking her training into consideration, she is able to rise above it all and give this monstrous villain a run for his money. You almost feel sorry for him and speaking of Moonface, is he really just a senseless killer or does he have a purpose? This film will have you questioning who the real villian is.

Another outstanding aspect of this episode is its dark, sinister tone. The ambiance alone is enough to send chills down your spine. Aside from a few flashback scenes, there is nothing but darkness on screen lightened only by the moon above and even more disturbing are the human scarecrows, artfully arranged in this maniac's back yard, with their eyes removed and rays of moonlight streaming through their gaping eye sockets. Very effectively done. I thoroughly enjoyed most episodes from the MOH series but there are a few that were technically well made and hold up to repeated viewings, this is one of them. It takes a ""been there done that"" type of scenario and injects new life into it by giving us another type of heroine who is typically tough, gorgeous but not vulnerable and definitely not an idiot, and another type of villain (or should I say villains?). Add in the gore, atmosphere, good performances, a few twists here and there and you've got yourself a solid horror tale that is original despite being very familiar territory.

2531695,5,B000ERVKMG,"Showtime's Masters of Horror anthology series got off to one hell of a good start with Incident on and off a Mountain Road.  The brainchild of Mick Garris, the Masters of Horror series essentially gave one famed horror director after another the chance to make and direct a one hour film of their choosing.  Given such free reign over the production, each director was limited by little more than his imagination - and, as you would expect, this proved to be a strong formula for great horror.  Don Coscarelli of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantasm/dp/B000MV8ABS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantasm</a>&nbsp;fame apparently drew the first straw and got to go first - and he set the bar high.  Teaming up with Joe R. Lansdale, who wrote the short story this film is based on, Coscarelli even brings Phantasm's Angus Scrimm along for what proves to be a glorious joyride into the dark side of human nature.

After crashing into a seemingly abandoned car on an otherwise deserted mountain road, Ellen (the drop-dead gorgeous Bree Turner) searches for another possible accident victim.  Following a trail of blood, she finds the other car's driver being dragged along by some kind of human monster.  All too soon, Ellen finds herself on the run from ""Moonface"" (John DeSantis) through the forest.  I know what you're thinking: here we go again with the same old ""monster chases girl through the woods"" plot we've seen time and time again.  I'll grant you that this has all the earmarks of a complete mismatch, but Ellen has a few tricks up her dainty little sleeve.  As a series of flashbacks begin to show us, Ellen is in a relationship with a ""survivalist"" (Ethan Embry) who has taught her quite a bit about surviving against all odds.  Of course, Ellen's little surprises for Moonface don't always work out the way she wanted - and that makes for some really great moments.

Apart from the flashbacks - which are necessary for the story to unfold as effectively as it does - this is a tightly-wound, taut thriller with a few weirdly comedic moments supplied by Angus Scrimm.  As much as I liked the story and the direction, though, I have to say that Bree Turner pretty much makes the film such a treat to watch.  She's hot, obviously, but she's also quite a very good actress - sort of a younger version of Jennifer Love Hewitt, in my eyes.  I really want to see more of her in the horror genre.  The film isn't perfect, though.  For one thing, it's very difficult to see what Ellen ever saw in her man Bruce, who even spent their first date carrying on about how horrible the world is.  I also have to admit that I had trouble making Ethan Embry fit the role of a big and tough survival enthusiast, as he's still the excitable kid from Can't Hardly Wait to me.

I have to put any of my small quibbles aside, though, because Incident on and off a Mountain Road does what it does exceedingly well - and it does it with a rare mixture of gore and subtlety.  (I kid you not - there is bona fide nuance in this little masterpiece.)  Even though there's nothing completely original to the story and there aren't any plot twists that you couldn't have predicted at some point along the way, this film truly delivers the goods.  Don Coscarelli and Joe R. Lansdale make for a great team (having already given the world the cult classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bubba-Ho-Tep-Limited-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0001LQJMQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bubba Ho-Tep (Limited Collector's Edition)</a>) and really hit another home run with this one.

2531698,5,B000ERVKMG,"A woman named Ellen (Bree Turner) was driving one night down a road in a mountain until she gets into a car accident. Luckily she survives but not for long as a ugly and crazy hillbilly named Moonface (John de Santis) goes after her as she discovers a horrifying secret about this cretin for now she must fight for her life.

Co-starring Ethan Embry and Angus Scrimm (The Tallman from ""Phantasm"" fame), this MOH story is directed by Don Coscralli (""Phantasm Series"", ""Bubba Ho-Tep"" and ""Beastmaster""). This is one of the most intense and bloodiest of the MOH tales, inspired by the 70's and 80's killer hillbilly movies like ""Mother's Day"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and even ""The Hills Have Eyes"" this is a gripping story of survival. The story is quite good while the acting is alright but Scrimm does a great peformance here as one of Moonfaces's victims, the cretin in this movie is an interesting and scary backwoods killer whom is very much like a modern Leatherface. There is some gory sequences like how Moonface makes his scarecrows out of human beings and of course a bizarre twist in the end makes this a great tale.

2531702,4,B000ERVKMG,"Listening to this episode and seeing the result is to see the end result of a group of craftsmen in film and cinema. As some note ,this is basically a film in one hour, and the quality of production is very high. The commentaries are very informative as to the source material, and also how this source material gets changed. It gives a good idea on how an idea may get changed, but I think that much of this material is a matter of taste. Whilst I found some of it reminiscent of JEEPERS CREEPERS, the style was done very well, and in a sufficiently creepy manner for me to enjoy, even though I usually favour the supernatural style horror. The Ambience of all scenes is suffocatingly real and creepy with the detail in 5.1 , and this was definitely aimed at by the audio people.

2531724,3,B000ERVKMG,"Master of Horror was a somewhat uneven show for me. The premise is great, compile prolific horror directors and have them each film an hour long episode. Let me break down the ratings for the episodes as follows:

Chocolate - The worst of the bunch, easily. *
Cigarette Burns - The best of the bunch, easily. *****
Dance of the Dead - Pretty boring and instantly forgettable. **
Deep Woman - Entertaining, but nothing special. ***
Dreams in the Witch House - Pretty good Lovecraft adaptation. ****
Fair Haired Child - Good, if somewhat disjointed. ***
Haeckel's Tale - Could have been so much more. ***
Homecoming - Almost the worst of the bunch. *
Imprint - Not as graphic as they made it out to be, good, but not great. ***
Incident On and Off a Mountain Road - Fun, but comes up a bit short. ***
Jenifer - Nice addition from the Italian master. ****
Pick Me Up - Dueling serial killers, a fun story. ***
Sick Girl - Pretty weird, but it is Lucky McKee, and it's excellent. ****

So all in all it was a slightly above average season, and now it is packed into one box for ease. Maybe I was expecting a bit too much out of this, but given the varied directors, styles and skills, I knew I couldn't expect perfection. It is called Masters of Horror, and if they had trimmed the fat a bit and made it a show about nothing but truly great horror directors, it would have been better.",1208822400,7,1381,4.3076923076923075
2531725,3,B000ERVKMG,"Overall, I enjoyed this set less than season one volume two.  Cigarette Burns had an interesting premise and a dark atmosphere.  Probably my favorite.  Incident on and off a mountain road was gory and suspenseful, based on a short story by Joe Lansdale, one of my favorite authors.  I'm not a Lovecraft fan, so Dreams in the Witch House was so-so for me.  Clive Barker's short story ""Haekel's Tale"" is excellent.  Too bad the first twenty minutes of this episode had nothing at all to do with his original work.  Bad makeup and bad acting made the rest of that episode suffer.  I think the director was afraid or unable to address the topic of necromancy and/or necrophilia in a serious way and went for the campy gross out approach instead.  Dance of the Dead rubbed me the wrong way for some reason, maybe because of Robert Englund's over the top performance.  Finally, Chocolate, which was my least favorite episode of the season.  The scenes involving the actor who portrayed Max Headroom back in the 80's as the frontman of a punk band were better left on the cutting room floor and it improve much from there.  I give the set three stars on the strength of Incident on and Off a Mountain Road and Cigarette Burns.",1208390400,3,1219,4.566820276497696
2531726,2,B000ERVKMG,"Most of the shows of this series contain gory scenes. The majority of the plots are original to me. For example in ""Home Coming"", soldier zombies got out of their coffins to cast votes against the Iraq War! It's entertaining but not scary or suspenseful.

There are 2 bad things listed below.
1. There are only about 3 suspensful and scary scenes in all 20 shows!
For example in ""The Right to Die"", the male character was in the bath tub by himself. Suddenly, he saw his wife appeared right in front of him. What happened next was very scary to me.

2. All of the shows have many extremely logical holes that make them ridiculous. It's really disappointing.

In short, they're worth renting but not buying. I prefer Tales from the Crypt. They're more suspenseful even though their special effects are below par.",1208044800,7,811,4.618055555555555

2531728,1,B000ERVKMG,"I wanted to offer a personal insight for this DVD collection since Amazon sometimes lacks intelligent feedback.

I must admit the packaging for this collection is quite interesting.  If you buy this set new, it arrives in a hard cellophane case with the DVD ""mausoleum"" inside.  The concept is unique: a designer crypt with several DVD cuffs inside.  So for this bit of commercial enhancement, I give big thumbs up.  I was able to easily wrap it and give it to a horror-buff buddy of mine that was very pleased.

However however however, I must tell you how sorely disappointed I am with the actual flicks.  I was either comatose with boredom for more than half of them...or I was bleeding from the eyes with the remaining crapfest.  Personally, that's really saying something, you know, because I'm a nice non-critical guy that likes everything.  Until now.

These 1-hour skits literally define derivative.  Bad dialogue, silly over-acting, and moldy plots.  Each film is an unfair reflection of how good these directors can actually be.  Bad budgets?  Time constraints?  Or possibly that the whole production is Canadian...and that can spell big TROUBLE.

Unfortunately, I don't have even 1 good thing to say about the whole mess.  Even the truly dedicated horror fan will find this collection offensive after just a few shows.  This ""stab"" at horror would have better left on the cutting room floor.  Sorry!",1202947200,8,1410,4.948717948717949

It's bad enough they said they'd never release the full season in order to sucker people into buying the original individual releases. Now they pull this nonsense.",1198195200,9,439,4.641025641025641
2531731,4,B000ERVKMG,"If you're not a horror fan then you won't find much of interest in these Masters of Horror episodes.  Limited to the One-hour format, the really interesting ones cry out for feature length treatment and those that blow make for long suffering.  Overall the first season hits the mark and some really good directors get to shine.

I'd rank them up as follows:

1. Cigarette Burns.  The best episode of the entire first season.  John Carpenter is in full horror mode, working with an excellent script and putting his inimitable stamp on it.  The gore flows here and packs a punch and the story is creepy all the way.  This film in particular could have easily been stretched to feature length.

2. Haeckel's Tale.  Surprisingly good period piece concerning a medical student and his interest in reviving the dead.  Owes more than a bit to Michele Soavi's Dellamorte Dellamore but overall this episode is fairly atmospheric and suspenseful.

3. Incident on and off a Mountain Road.  Nasty villain, cool gore scenes and a tight story with a satisfying conclusion.  Fails to hit the bull's eye yet very entertaining for the most part.

4. Dreams in the Witch House.  Stuart Gordon is back in H.P. Lovecraft territory.  Atmospheric little flick with some nasty gore and some solid suspense, overall quite effective.

5. Chocolate.  Not a bad idea but poorly executed.  Henry Thomas does well in a very difficult role to pull off but in the end the material lets him down.  It's not horror, not drama so you don't really know how to label it.

6. Dance of the Dead.  While not a terrible idea the film doesn't work at all.  Annoying fast cuts and intolerable music sink this flick and while the core idea is fairly shocking it's all for naught.  Bad performances too apart from Englund who deserves better material.

The extras are extremely good with lengthy documentaries on each film, interviews, all the scripts and more.  If you're interested this set is well worth buying.",1196553600,17,1971,4.771513353115727
2531732,4,B000ERVKMG,"Overall I have been very dissapointed with the MOH series on a whole but did find this installment a breathe of fresh air. The only one I really enjoyed was ""The Black Cat"" up until now. ""Incident on and off a mountain road"" was a really fun story for any horror fan. I realize this type of plot has been done many times before. But even if it isn't a new idea, if it is pulled off right it can feel very original. Thats how I felt with this one. The killer has a very creepy backwoods look that would definately freak out anyone. I certainly wouldn't want to catch this guy in the woods at night.
I would definately recommend this one. Especially for those of you that search wide and far to find a mildly entertaining MOH installment.",1195603200,,736,4.264285714285714
2531733,5,B000ERVKMG,"I realize the MOH series is hit-or-miss, most of the episodes falling somewhere in between. This one, however, hits the mark dead-on. Very well developed for being only an hour in length, Coscarelli really summons the dark atmorsphere and swings back and forth via flashbacks quite effectivly.

The gore is plentiful, the effects are great, the dialouge is above the standard fare and the actors really get into their roles. This one, along with Dreams in the Witch House are my faves from season 1. Lansdale fans should nod their approval of this well executed adaptation.",1194739200,2,573,4.96875
2531744,4,B000ERVKMG,"If you don't know about them, the Masters of Horror series are cable's version of horror movies set to hour-long themes. Sometimes they seem like The Outer Limits, sometimes The Twilight Zone, and sometimes they go into horrid realms where you expect the to play. The series here is Widescreen, a lovely thing, and collects 6 tales in this set.

If you take each and look them up, you'll see that these are all a mixed bag. That said, some of the pieces in this set are really worth exploring. The reviews on these are mixed, mind you, and this listing is more to summarize the set of movies than to records everything about them. Still, Cigarette Burns and Haeckel's Tale are good and the price is GREAT on the movies as a look. Look at them separately - even if you like a few it is a good pick.
That said, Chocolate and Dance of the Dead - I wish I could have had my time back. Shame on Mick Garris for his production and Tobe Hooper should know better.

This set has in it:
Movies:
(1)Masters of Horror: Incident on and off a Mountain Road (2005)
Don Coscarelli's addition to the 1st season, with love given to the slasher side of horror in an interesting little tale of travesty. The title says a lot about the movie and it is more horror than many of the Masters of horror movies.
(2)Masters of Horror: Dreams in the Witch-House (2005)
Stuart Gordon adding in another doing what he likes to do, making an ""H.P.Lovecraft Adaptation"" as Miskatonic University starts the dreams of the rat-faced terror.
(3)Masters of Horror: Dance of the Dead (2005)
Tobe Hooper's story about an MC tht does something a little bit, mmm, odd.
(4)Masters of Horror: Cigarette Burns (2005)
John Carpenter's shot at the 1st season, with a story about an unspeakable movie that people would die to see. I really liked this one.
(5)Masters of Horror: Chocolate (2005)
Mick Garris weaves a tale of visions that become something more in  rather disappointing tale that I don't even like summarizing.
(6)Masters of Horror: Haeckel's Tale (2006)
Joe McNaughton and Clive Barker (and Romero) period piece about a man and his want to bring the dead back.

Extras -
Not so much. You have interviews with all the directions, storyboards, ""working with the masters"" featurettes, interviews with cast and crew, and the normal bios.
Basically, its minimalism in this department.

If you like B movie horror, you can really love these tales. Some of them are better than that, and an hour is a good cut of a movie that leaves out thirty minutes of drag-time.
Basically, you have to ask what your pleasure is because only you can answer that.",1194048000,19,2609,4.614224137931035

2531746,4,B000ERVKMG,"My experience with Masters of Horror started with Dario Argento's Jenifer. That movie was so screwed up that it actually disturbed me- not an easy feat. But after seeing Jenifer, I knew I had to have more. So as the DVD's started coming out I started renting or buying them, and had enjoyed all the ones I'd seen. Before I got the box set, I had seen Cigarette Burns, Dreams In The Witch House, The Fair Haired Child, and Jenifer, and was extremely impressed with them all. I'm not going to start complaining about how this box set should have been released initially, because everyone knew a box set would come out eventually- you just had to be patient. Anyways, here's my scores for the films.

1.1 Incident On And Off A Mountain Road (Don Coscarelli)- 3.5/5 This one was entertaining, and had a great cast. The main villain was rather creepy, too. I just thought the final confrontation felt rushed. This one definately needed more time.

1.2 Dreams in the Witch House (Stuart Gordon) 4/5 This one was great. I'm an H.P. Lovecraft fan, so that gave it props for me before I even saw the episode. It was genuinely creepy.

1.3 Dance of the Dead (Tobe Hooper) 3.5/5 I thought this was pretty good. The character development was exceptional, and the final twist, while not entirely unexpected, was very appropriate for the story. Plus, it had Robert Englund.

1.4 Jenifer (Dario Argento) 3.5/5 This episode freaked me out when I first saw it. I loved the gore, but I couldn't help but question the detective's choices regarding Jenifer.

1.5 Chocolate (Mick Garris) 3/5 This was decent. It had some really good moments, and I'd watch it again, but it definately wasn't my favorite.

1.6 Homecoming (Joe Dante) 0/5 This episode was absolute garbage. Zombies coming back to vote? Were they high? This was just stupid. I had to FORCE myself to sit through the whole episode, thinking there may be some gore or something. There wasn't. This episode was just plain boring.

1.7 Deer Woman (John Landis) 4.5/5 This episode was hilarious. I loved this one, and I'm not usually a fan of John Landis's work, but this one was great.

1.8 Cigarette Burns (John Carpenter) 5/5 Absolutely perfect episode. Loved John's direction, plus it had Norman Reedus and lots of gore. Perfect.

1.9 The Fair Haired Child (William Mallone) 4/5 I really enjoyed this one. The lead actress was very good looking, the monster was creepy, and the gore was adequate.

1.10 Sick Girl (Lucky McKee) 3.5/5 Another one of those funny episodes. I enjoyed this one too, and thought both lead female characters were hilarious.

1.11 Pick Me Up (Larry Cohen) 3/5 This was pretty good. Both serial killers were rather likable. I just felt it was missing a little something, I don't know what.

1.12 Haeckel's Tale (Roger Corman) 3.5/5 Another good episode, based on Clive Barker's short story (which was why I was so excited to watch it). Great gore, great acting, perfectly morbid conclusion.

1.13 Imprint (Takashi Miike) 4/5 This one was genuinely disturbing. NOT FOR THE FAINT OF HEART. AT ALL. Great direction, wonderful sets, great characters. Very good episode.

The only reason I give this box set a 4 out of 5 is because of Homecoming. That episode was so bad it brought down the overall value of the box set, I thought.",1190592000,10,3291,4.730769230769231

I really like the fact that all thirteen discs fit into a still impressively sized presentation box, which provides a fittingly appropriate home for what are hour long visitations from the grave.
Sure the box could have been more sturdy, but if treated with care should be a future collectors item, unlike the endless copies with plastic cases. The only loss here is the cover artwork, but as a collector short of space this compact box-set suits me fine. Looking forward to the eventual second season box-set. With so many special edition horror DVDs packaged in a coffin shaped box, I have at least six, it is refreshing to finally get an actual tomb !

I'm very much enjoying watching the episodes, being able to watch them as and when I like is a joy as I've never seen any of them prior to this set, so this is all fresh for me. So far I have to declare Jennifer as a favorite, a return to form for Mr Argento in my opinion. Surprised at the level of sex and violence, not pulling any punches for television horror.
I recommend this box set to anyone like myself who enjoys looking at their DVD box-sets as objects of art.",1189814400,6,1186,4.460829493087558

I DO enjoy the Masters of Horror series (some good episodes, some bad, none great), but I'm a horror fanatic and not particularly discriminating.  I love the fact that some of the greatest horror film directors are involved with this and, though these short films are not anyone's best work by a long shot, as I said I do enjoy this series nonetheless.

The company milks their cult favorites for all they're worth, and they're not going to stop as long as money is made.

I personally liked a lot of Showtime's Masters of Horror series.  What a great idea a bunch of influential directors in the horror genre doing one hour films.  Some were great and some not so great but every Sunday while the seasons played you'd have the opportunity to see something new in horror.
These discs were originally released individually and someone could've easily payed twice as much as this set is worth, for those people, the people who probably followed the show the closest, were it's biggest supporters contributing ratings, and contributed money for their monthly Showtime subscriptions it sucks this wasn't released at first.
For the people that liked the show but never picked any up this is a great deal.
From a marketing and business side i guess this was smart to get more money out of people.

For one reason or another, popular opinion was that the series was a huge let down with one or two that were decent.

I couldn't understand why they wouldn't release a box set immediately with some of the ""round table"" discussions of the horror directors that they showed before the episodes on Showtime.  I wrote to them asking if they were planning it, and explaining that as a loyal fan and stanch defender of the show I would like to know if I should hold out. They never responded.  Well I didn't hold out, put a lot of money in their pockets, and now they're looking to get more.  I am happy with the DVDs I got, but I am also a completest and feel slighted as a fan that helped make the series so successful in the first place.

In this one, a young woman (Bree Turner) is stranded in the woods after a car accident, only to be pursued by a hulking mountain maniac called Moonface (John De Santis).  Unfortunately for him, she was once involved in a thoroughly unconvincing relationship with a survivalist gun nut (Ethan Embry).  (When he says, on their first date, something like: ""Sometimes I just want to get rid of all the idiots,"" she says, with a dreamy expression on her face: ""You want to get out of here?"")  She sets little traps for Moonface in the woods and, naturally, he blunders right into them (with, I admit, one rather gory exception).  Although many reviewers cite this as a welcome bit of originality in the woman-in-peril scenario, I felt that I had seen this type of thing many times before.  The ""Rambo"" movies come to mind.  The fact that a woman is setting the snares this time didn't make it feel particularly fresh to me.

2531761,2,B000ERVKMG,"With few exceptions, (CIGARETTE BURNS) I think we may all be coming to realize that this series and its vignettes are by in large disappointments.  Horror fans do have high expectations, and perhaps the bar keeps getting raised in what may be unrealistically large increments.  But also, these stories are not that clever, and the execution isn't generally very scary or original.

As for this episode, I am a BIG fan of Don Coscarelli, and perhaps that may be a factor that resulted in impractically high expectations.  This film definitely wasn't the worst of the bunch (HOMECOMING, CHOCOLATE).  It wasn't terrible, or even all that bad.  It was competently made, with a creepy and disturbing atmosphere, which is what the director was trying for, and did generate some chilling moments.  But it wasn't all that great either.  I don't even know if I can say it was very good.  Even an actor whom I am a fan of (Angus Scrimm) portrayed a character so poorly written for, that it was difficult to tell if he was supposed to be funny or not.  It was a wasted appearance of a fine actor (and very nice guy in real life).

The bottom line is, the rating system we get doesn't examine complex criteria that goes into film-making, nor other objective measures of quality.  Simply put, it is based on whether you love or like or dislike or hate a film.  In the end, I just didn't like this all that much - not enough for a 3-star anyways.  Maybe if the cute actress (BREE TURNER) had gotten nude...",1175558400,3,1492,4.56015037593985
2531762,4,B000ERVKMG,"Directed by Don Coscarelli (the man responsible for the gut-wrenching ""Phantasm"" films and the brilliantly quirky ""Bubba Ho-tep""), ""Incident"" was a fine start to Showtime's promising (but spotty) ""Masters of Horror"" series.

The beautiful Bree Turner has spent most of her career playing snobby sorority girls and providing attractive scenery to relatively benign movies and T.V. shows.  She takes the helm here as Ellen, a woman who wrecks her car late at night while driving through the mountains.  Her problems, of course, turn out to be larger than a dented fender.  Namely, she must square off with Moonface, a creature who is far deadlier than his name implies.

Ellen, refreshingly, is not your typical horror movie Damsel In Distress.  She proves herself to be a worthy (and entertaining) foe to the disturbing creature who stalks her through the rocky woods, a pleasant change of pace from the women who stumble on broken heels, make ludicrous decisions, and prefer screaming to thinking.

In a series of well-placed flashbacks, Coscarelli gives us glimpses of her education in survival, taking place at the hands of her too-eager boyfriend/husband, Bruce.  Played by Ethan Embry (who hasn't made much of himself since his ""Can't Hardly Wait"" days), Bruce is a convincing character, but it's hard to imagine how his slightly off-putting insistence managed to snag a smart and capable lady like Ellen.

No matter.  Coscarelli leaves explanations aside, avoiding unnecessary details.  What's really important is the tooth-and-nail present.  Coscarelli uses standard horror film elements to mold together something decidedly unique and satisfying.  It's not particularly ground-breaking, nor is it without its flaws (the flashbacks, while important, sap the story of some of its tension), but it is a comforting bit of entertainment, especially for Fright Fans who are afraid that the genre is in danger of dying a slow and boring death.",1174867200,3,1943,5.289902280130293

2531775,3,B000ERVKMG,"Masters of Horror: Incident On and Off a Mountain Road (Don Coscarelli, 2005)

I love Don Coscarelli. And I will always love Don Coscarelli, even if he never makes another good movie, because he made one of the best film has to offer in Phantasm. So when Mick Garris' Masters of Horror series started off with a Don Coscarelli flick, it was obviously a good pairing, right?

Well, to an extent. While this is an interesting little tale, albeit one that falls apart at the end, the things that made Phantasm so great are notably absent or muted here; in other words, it's a decent little horror flick, but there's nothing about it that says ""this is a Don Coscarelli film."" And that, given that the idea of the series is to spotlight the guy behind the camera, seems to make it somewhat wanting.

Bree Turner, whose career has mostly been limited to awful teen comedies, gets to flex her acting muscles as Ellen, the main character here. At the beginning, all we know is that she's driving, she has an accident, and that the indirect cause of that accident is a rather nasty Leatherface-type (John DeSantis of the thankfully short-lived Blade: The Series). As we get deeper into the tale, we learn that Ellen has a survivalist ex-husband (Ethan Embry, who made FreakyLinks worth watching) who taught her some tricks of the trade that might help her survive this rather nasty encounter.

It's a fun little flick for what it is, and it's always nice to get an eyeful of Angus Scrimm. Things suddenly take a turn for the worse in the final five minutes, though, when one of the characters goes through a complete, and unexplained, shift in personality. Deus ex Machina, your moment has arrived! That does end things on a rather sour note, and the lack of what I can only call essential Coscarelli-ness doesn't help matters. But it's still fun. ** ",1160956800,2,1843,4.641104294478527
2531776,4,B000ERVKMG,"Unlike such horror anthologies before it like Tales From the Crypt, Showtime's Masters of Horror, created by Mick Garris (best known for bringing many Stephen King tales to TV) offers no-holds barred horror from some of the best names in the business.  In this first episode of the series, Don Coscarelli (Phantasm, Bubba Ho-Tep) once again adapts a Joe R. Lansdale story.  Incident On and Off a Mountain Road involves a resourceful young woman (Bree Turner) with a shady past turns the tables on the monstrous killer stalking her in the woods, with bloody results.  The acting is good (Ethan Embry turns in a surprisingly intense role in flashback sequences) and the gore and makeup effects are top notch (what else would you expect from Greg Nicotero and Howard Berger?).  Though it rarely goes beyond it's slasher roots, the story is engaging, and Coscarelli keeps piling on the suspense, and Angus Scrimm, better known as the Tallman from Phantasm, even makes an appearance.  All in all, Incident On and Off a Mountain Road is a great beginning to Masters of Horror, and it's easily one of the best in the series so far.",1160265600,2,1124,4.803108808290156

2531778,4,B000ERVKMG,"Don Coscarelli was one of the horror directors invited by Mick Garris to participate and create a full hour episode for the new Showtime horror anthology series, Masters of Horror. Coscarelli accepted and his contribution to the horror anthology series was a telefilm adaptation of Joe R. Lansdale's short story of the same name: ""Incident on and off a Mountain Road."" After watching this Coscarelli installment, I would say that he's succeeded in adapting another one of Lansdale's tales (Bubba Ho-Tep being the other).

""Incident on and off a Mountain Road"" has the typical backwoods, mutant slasher-killer hunting down your typical babe-in-the-woods female whose only fault was being in the wrong place at the wrong time. Right from the beginning Coscarelli's episode already shows that things might be abit different from your typical slasher story with the immediate memory flashback by the female lead (gamely and beautifully played by the cute-as-a-button Bree Turner). The flashbacks happen throughout the film as Ellen (Turner) remembers the things she learned on how to survive when faced by imminent danger in a strange landscape. For some the sudden break from the high-tension of the chase between the killer, aptly named Moonface, and Ellen might be abit jarring, but the flashbacks do help add backstory to what would have been just a run-of-the-mill slasher tale. The backstory pretty much shows the viewer that Ellen is, or was, married to someone named Bruce (played with deadly seriousness by Ethan Embry) whose obsession with all things survivalist pulled Ellen into the lifestyle of learning how to survive. The flashbacks also show how a perfect marriage and partnership slowly turned abusive in more ways than one. This change of pace in the film makes us root for Ellen to survive her encounter with Moonface as we've invested quite abit in her well-being.

I won't say that the film has nothing thrilling to it. When the flashbacks end and we're brought back to Ellen and her current situation things pick up once more. Moonface (played by John De Santis) brings to mind past boogeymen like Leatherface, Jason, and your typical inbred, mountain-men like those in forgettable films like Wrong Turn. He's in the story just to act as the immediate focus for Ellen's baptism of fire, so to speak. He's an unknown entity whose only purpose was to terrorize Ellen and all who gets in his way. He's abit like a force of nature that one either accepts and deals with accordingly or get run over if one in its way. Ellen does the latter and to satisfying result. Coscarelli long-time collaborator Angus Scrimm makes an appearance as Buddy, an old man devoid of sanity after being left in Moonface's care for an undetermined lenght of time. His character brings out feelings of pity, detestation and finally acceptance. Ellen's actions towards Buddy in the end of the film shows that she's accepted his role in all that's happened and feels pity and acceptance to treat the old man the only way she could.

People always thought Coscarelli was of the gore-type of horror director, but they'd be wrong to assume that. Throughout all the Phantasm films and up to Bubba Ho-Tep, Coscarelli didn't use much gore in his films. He instead relied to feelings of tension and dread followed up by a sudden shocking scene to the system. In this Masters of Horror episode, we get to see Coscarelli dabble in the magic of gore. He doesn't go to the level that Carpenter did in Cigarette Burns, but the scene with Moonface and his industrial drill was very Fulci-esque. Even with his dabbling with gore sequences, Coscarelli errs on the side of less is more. But the gore that we do see was done by none other than the gore-effects masters from KNB EFX.

All in all, Coscarelli's ""Incident on and off a Mountain Road"" was a fresh new take on an old staple of the horror genre. I would actually label this episode more of a survival story than one of horror, but to each their own. This episode was the second I've seen on dvd and I have to say it's much better than Carpenter's. It bodes well for the rest I've yet to see.",1152230400,4,4123,4.8192090395480225
2531779,5,B000ERVKMG,"John Carpenter, Tobe Hooper, Dario Argento, Joe Dante, Don Coscarelli, Takashi Miike. These are but some of the powerhouse names in horror that were enlisted to direct episodes of ""Masters of Horror"", a 13-episode series that debuted last fall on the Showtime network. Comparisons to other TV horror anthologies such as Tales from the Crypt, Twilight Zone and Friday the 13th were inevitably made but ""Masters"" decidedly differs from those in several aspects as there is no host, no commercials and little trace of humor/camp. No, Masters of Horror is a no-holds barred hardcore horror anthology that gives full creative freedom to its directors, many of them names that have been known to not pull any punches whatsoever.

What I particularly like about the show is that there is no guiding voice, or TV producer, telling the director how things should be. Each episode has the director's own personal stamp on it, to give us the feeling that ""This is not a masters of horror episode, it's a Dario Argento movie, or a Takashi Miike movie, etc."" The result of this creative freedom and unique concept is an anthology where every episode feels uniquely distinct from one another.

The third episode of Masters to be released on DVD is ""Incident on and off a mountain road"", directed by Don Coscarelli.  Coscarelli has become a cult name in horror almost exclusively based on the success of his ""Phantasm"" series that consists of the original 1979 classic and its three decent sequels.  Outside of Phantasm he hadn't made much worth mentioning until, that is, in 2002 with the release of Bubba Ho-tep, a wacky uncategorizable film based on a Joe R. Lansdale short story.  So successful was Bubba Ho-tep that a sequel (with Lansdale again in the writing chair) is currently in production and Coscarelli has directed this episode of Masters that is also based on a Lansdale short out of the author's ""High Cotton"" anthology.  After being known almost exclusively for the Phantasm movies, Coscarelli's adaptations of Lansdale stories has breathed new life into his career.

Story:  A woman driving alone on an isolated stretch of a mountainous road crashes her car while taking her eyes off the road to switch radio stations.  Things go from bad to worse when she ends up being chased around by a mutant-faced maniac (""Moonface"") wielding a huge knife.  While being chased by Moonface, we see flashbacks of the woman's near-past relationship with an ex-boyfriend, a soldier who would teach her survival techniques.  The woman is able to use the survival techniques learned from the boyfriend to set up booby traps and clever escape routes to elude Moonface, who perhaps got a little more than he bargained for with this would-be victim.

This is only my third Masters episode that I've watched (the other two being Cigarette Burns and Dreams in the Witch House) and it's definitely the best so far.  In fact, I'd be very surprised if any subsequent episode of Masters that I watch would be as good as this one.  Simply put, it is a classic.  While other episodes of Masters seem to go for the ""weird"" factor in horror with different degrees of pacing, this one goes for the throat with a non-stop unrelenting pace.  This is fast-paced suspense on a par with Dean Koontz novels, thrown in with horrific macabre touches based around the lair of Moonface, who is truly evil incarnate.  The flashbacks work surprisingly well and do little to slow the pace.  The locales are absolutely stunning, as the chase leads us through forests and creeks under the moonlit night.  Filmed near Vancouver, those familiar with the area will get a kick out of the scene filmed on the Capilano suspension bridge.  All this plus a very neat twist at the end make this a truly memorable episode.  Someone should look into licensing ALL the stories from High Cotton for Coscarelli to adapt.  The horror world would be a better place for it.",1150934400,27,3912,4.851127819548872

2531781,5,B000ERVKMG,"Of the four ""Masters of Horror"" DVDs I've seen so far, ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road is easily the best, blowing past Mick Garris' entry and narrowly edging out John Carpenter's and Stuart Gordon's stories.  First, ""Incident"" skillfully delivers the kind of expected thrills one looks for in a horror film (in this case, we get a monstrous killing machine chasing a young woman through the woods) but then throws in, equally skillfully, a few ""all is not as it seems"" elements and some welcome depth, subtlety, and complexity in the characterizations.  It all adds up to a great hour or so of gritty entertainment.

The extras in this DVD series continue to be top notch.  Contrary to Amazon's description, ""Incident"" actually includes TWO commentaries, one by director/writer Don Coscarelli and co-writer Stephen Romano and one by Mr. Coscarelli and Joe R. Lansdale, who wrote the original short story that was adapted into the ""Incident"" film.  In fact, listening to how much Mr. Coscarelli and Mr. Romano regard Joe Lansdale's stories on the first commentary track and then hearing from the fascinating Mr. Lansdale himself on the second commentary track made me go to the book section of Amazon to order a paperback copy of ""High Cotton: Selected Short Stories of Joe R. Lansdale"".  The book contains the original 16-page short story ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" (which for years Mr. Coscarelli wanted to adapt) and several other stories.  I'm really looking forward to getting it.

By the way, that's the other great thing about these ""Masters of Horror"" DVDs: they constantly talk up, and make you want to seek out, other films by the featured creator or ""Master of Horror"" in question, and they also make sure to tell you about the literary sources (H.P. Lovecraft, Joe R. Lansdale, etc.) of some of these short films, in the event you want to check out the original stories.

Longtime genre fans will recognize the name Coscarelli, of course, as he is the writer/director of the classic horror flick PHANTASM (1979) and its sequels, director and co-writer of the sword-and-sorcery fantasy THE BEASTMASTER (1982), and the writer/director of the more contemporary horror-comedy cult favorite BUBBA HO-TEP (2002).

An adaptation of the short story by genre author Joe R. Lansdale--who also wrote the story on which BUBBA HO-TEP was based--""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" is an interesting, fresh take on the girl-chased-through-the-woods slasher-type flick, one with a very wry twist at the end. It stars cute actress Bree Turner (some genre fans my recognize her from 2005's JEKYLL + HYDE) as Ellen, a young woman who has an auto accident late one night while driving through the rural mountains of Oregon.  After crawling from the wreckage and trying to assess the damage, Ellen quickly finds herself pursued by a hulking mountain-dwelling madman (John De Santis, familiar to horror fans from his role as Lurch in the short-lived  late-1990s TV series THE NEW ADDAMS FAMILY).  But Ellen is no ordinary damsel in distress.  Through occasional flashbacks, it is revealed that her ex-husband was an obsessive survivalist and that he forced her to participate in his training sessions.  And as a result, Ellen has a few tricks up her sleeve that just may help her outwit her brutish pursuer and survive the night.

As is, Lansdale's original story rises way above the cliche of its slasher roots, but the script by Coscarelli and his co-writer, Stephen Romano, ratchet it up even higher by adding some elements only hinted at by Lansdale.  This enables Coscarelli, as director, to create a 60-minute visual ride that is dense with layers of thrills, suspense, and shocks that lesser directors would have trouble fitting into a two-hour flick.  Of course, he is helped by the outstanding acting abilities of Turner, whose talent allows her to convincingly vacillate between vulnerability and strength, as well as the intense performance from Ethan Embry (who plays Ellen's ex-husband in flashback sequences) and the skills and menacing presence of De Santis.  Even Coscarelli's old friend Angus Scrimm--who became a genre icon playing the Tall Man in the classic PHANTASM series--makes a delightfully quirky appearance.

The DVD edition of ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" offers a pristine digital transfer of the filmic series episode in anamorphic widescreen at its original aspect ratio of 1.77:1.  And as is almost always the case with discs from the cool folks at Anchor Bay, the DVD is chockful with bonus features.  This one has TWO commentaries--one featuring writer/director Coscarelli and co-writer Romano (moderated by Anchor Bay's Perry Martin); the other with Coscarelli and author Joe R. Lansdale--an interview with Coscarelli; a documentary on Coscarelli's genre career; a special-effects featurette (hidden in an ""Easter egg""); and lots more!  It's well worth amazon.com's reasonable price of admission.

All in all, ""Incident On and Off a Mountain Road"" is a top-notch entry in Mick Garris' MASTERS OF HORROR series, and it leaves no doubt as to why Don Coscarelli was one of the first directors chosen to participate.  But even apart from the series and despite its short runtime of 60 minutes, the episode itself easily stands alone as a masterpiece of horror film, and it is sure to become a genre classic.  So even those rare horror fans not impressed by the overall TV series should seriously consider adding this flick to their collections.",1148256000,49,3971,5.081538461538462
8113655,5,B000ERVKMG,"My review of ""Imprint"" - Good God, this was one of the most jarring and difficult episodes to watch. Unbelievable, creepy, disgusting and unforgettable. If you know anything about the director Takashi Miike, then you would know you are in for quite the ride. This episode defies description. Brilliant, revolting, sickening  in a good way. Not for the weak at heart, I made it through once, and I am never watching it again lol.
