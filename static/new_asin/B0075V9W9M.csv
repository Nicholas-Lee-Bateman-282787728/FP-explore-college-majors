8510663,4,B0075V9W9M,"So this is obviously pro creationism, but its more for people who are already convinced rather than an apologetic video. Its broken into segments that range from about 5-10 minutes each. Three of the segments are interviews with Dan the Animal Man who has the animal in person, and three are a talking head mixed with stock footage and photos.
The facts given about the animals are very interesting. The production is not bad, but also not the best. Young children would probably be bored. The main thrust is that the animals' abilities exhibit the glory of God and they could not have evolved bit by bit because their abilities are ridiculously complex and the animal could not survive if it had yet to evolve even one ability. A couple of the segments have a little devotional message to them.
Its pretty similar to (but I don't think as good as) the Incredible Creatures that Defy Evolution videos.",1368316800,4,901,4.708860759493671
