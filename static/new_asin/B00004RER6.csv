Mick is slack, cynical, and most of all unemployed, masterminds the plan! The reason for robbing the bank - FUN!!!
Starring Ben Mendelsohn and Jeremy Sims, this Australian movie is hilarious. The hijinks these two idiots get up to will have you rolling on the floor. There is a lot of offensive language though, but this does help the reality and humour of the movie. The cinematography of the suburbs of Sydney is fantastic. The Aussie hard metal soundtrack is awesome as well. Recommended to all who want a different kind of movie.",1029110400,2,697,4.584
7920745,5,B00004RER6,"I loved this film so much. It's got such strong performance's, it unfortunately started to remind me of most of my own mates. Ben Mendelson doesnt get the attention deserved of him and this film is his showcase  along with the equally brilliant Metal Skin. The imagery and cinematography  is quite stunning of terrible Sydney suburb backdrops and development, and  the environment surounding the two hapless characters seems to enhance the  desperation of their situation. Their interaction's with other people  prove's compelling viewing,from the garage drug dealer to one's deluded  wife. Theres a particuliar scene I will never forget,and still makes me  laugh out loud every time. While some factors and scenes can be disturbing  in this film,it never the less add's to the spiralling effect of the guy's  assumption's of life.
Overall 8.5/10 for this particuliar masterpiece.",956016000,3,880,5.318840579710145
7920746,4,B00004RER6,"In Australia, this movie has been on video for years and it's always been a classic in my eyes. It has a brilliant cast, a truly honest screenplay and stylish direction. It is also a great spin on the bank robbery genre.  (as is another great Australian movie ""Two Hands"")",953078400,2,272,4.44
