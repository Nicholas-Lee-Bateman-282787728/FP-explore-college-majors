8102868,2,B000DZ962U,"I can't recommend this video as there are so many good ones on the market.

While I feel these exercises have merit, to me, the title is misleading.

The exercises are extremely mild with very slooow progression. I would say that this series would be better for people who are rehabilitating or partially disabled or quite elderly. You might argue that the phrase ""in Chairs"" would be enough explanation, but there are plenty of other yoga practices done in chairs that are entirely different.

Unfortunately, the quality of the recording is poor. There is an echo to the words as though the room in which it was being recorded may have been large with high ceilings.

The leader is dressed sloppily with little regard to the picture she presents to the viewer. At first not knowing anything about the yoga practitioner or his/her program, the viewer will receive his/her impressions (healthy, caring, happy) by what they see. The indication here is a haphazard, home-grown program.",1217635200,2,982,4.933333333333334

Wonderful tape for anyone wanting a new approach to exercise or challenged with an injury, handicap or debilitating disease.  I bought one for myself and and one for my sister, who is in a wheelchair. Bought the tapes from Liz, personally.",1137196800,14,384,4.602941176470588
