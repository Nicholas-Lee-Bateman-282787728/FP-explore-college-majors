2043554,5,B0001Z3IJO,"This final season which is based on the meiji era are not actual episodes of the final season, the real last seaon was supposed to be The Jinchuu Arc a.k.a Revenge Arc which was based on the revenge of Enishi Kenshin's brother in law which was became with the marrage of Tomoe.
  These filler episodes which was produced by sony are based on a religious time for Kenshin. For Kenshin has to face a group of Feug Sheui which want to take over Japan which also wants to take over ASIA. But thats later in the Meiji Era  series there are really funny parts in it too but the the stories lack of a lot of stuff I mean what is the main problem I mean the sory for the Wnadering Samurai was just an introductory so it really didn't have a real story line that I can understand but this was just a real weird season. But even though it really isn't really worth the money I will get this seaon anyway because I am a real fan but unless you are a real fan of Rurouni Kenshin don't waste your money on this because Legend of Kyoto ended the right way and remember these are just filler episodes",1089158400,8,1085,4.1571428571428575
2043555,3,B0001Z3IJO,"Background: Up until this season, the TV show closely followed the storylines of the Kenshin manga in Shonen. When this series was being made, the final ""Revenge"" arc of the Manga which was as good (or better) than the Kyoto arc was still being written. So this season of filler episodes, not written by Watsuki Nobuhiro was put out, got canceled due to lousy ratings and we NEVER get to see the true end of Ruruoni Kenshin on TV (the Samurai X OAVs Trust+Betrayal present a condensed version of Revenge arc's flashbacks and fight with Enishi).
So how is this series? Well the stand-alone filler episodes are fine and some of the mini-arcs are OK but others (esp. the Christian rebellion) are plodding, without memorable opponents or battles and very little character maturation. It's like the writers wanted to wait for Watsuki to write the character developement for his protagonists so they ended up treading water for an entire season. They also make some forays into the supernatural, which seems contrary to everything in the series thus far (Wastuki always tooks pains to show there was no magic in his characters, only skill and a few tricks).
The final episode, which was never shown on TV seems to have been animated on the cheap. It is actually sort of poignant in a weird way but you may be dissapointed if you expected some kind of resolution.
Technically speaking: The discs are fine but don't have as many features as some of the earlier ones. The subs are excellent but the dubs are pretty bad and the background audio is muted a bit on the dubbed track. WAY too expensive! For the price of all three sets you can get a plane ticket to Hong Kong and get the 'questionable' box which puts 8 episodes per disc (which the domestic version could have easily done but then no one would pay $150.00 for a season on 4 discs...)
Rurouni Kenshin - Wandering Samurai Box (5 stars)
Legend of Kyoto Box (5 stars)
Tales of the Meiji (3 stars, plus maybe a half-star because I really liked the final opening/theme song)",1089072000,14,2021,4.632311977715878
2043556,4,B0001Z3IJO,Iam a real fan of rurouni kenshin from 2003-2004 and I'm glad its not short because I like collecting a lot of DVD's and to learn more about the series. This side of the story is called tales of the meiji era and it deals with a lot of religious stuff and hard to imagine why. There are alot of funny stuff like when an artist falls in love with Kaoru and other stuff like that. The only thing I don't like about this box set is that there are only 33 episodes in this which there were suppodes to be 34 in this side of the series. Either the creators are finnaly making the Jinchu Arc or they are just tryin to get you get pissed off and get the LAST DVD just for one DVD. I am not reccommending this unless you are a real rurouni kenshin fan Like I am. Get this if you want to I don't really care.,1088726400,,799,3.9079754601226995
2043557,4,B0001Z3IJO,"In my opinion this third season was not at all needed.  It has some amazing stories in it however many of them were not needed nor to the quality of the rest of Rurouni Kenshin.
I still think that this is worth the money, and don't be fooled by the 70-80 dollar Full boxed sets on Ebay, those are illegal boot legged copies.  If you're into to supporting that kind of crap then go for it.  But anyone who wants the real thins will be happy with the money spent on the Real version.
This is a good buy, however if you are into season 2 and stongly feel that it is the best season then you may want to invest in the OVA's at least Trust and Betrayl, AND MAKE SURE THEY ARE NOT THE DIRECTORS CUT!!  They kinda botched some things up.  The Widescreem implimentation means that they simply cut off some of the top and bottom of the frame, because the OVA was drawn in Pan and Scan format.",1087862400,27,883,4.1104651162790695
2043558,5,B0001Z3IJO,"I love rurouni kenshin I own the ova's I have the motion picture and I also have the wandering samurai premium box. I am saving up my money for the legend of kyoto premium box I might buy it next month. I know people been disin this season because the story was weird or it was just filler episodes but I don't care about them because I know the series have never let me down and this season doesn't make a different. Once I get the Legend of Kyoto premium box at suncoast later, I will get this premium box right after, altough this season is a bit confusing and weird I will get this anyway.",1087344000,,593,4.120689655172414
2043559,4,B0001Z3IJO,"Season 3 doesn't seem like much when you heard the news of people thinking that they should've animated the arc from the manga, but they did this, and it's pretty good. I gave it a 4 because of the last arc called Feng Shui. It will make you go ""uggh...."" and ""wha....."" a lot, so that's why. The rest was pretty good. The filler episodes were VERY funny, especially the one when a paint artist falls in love with Kaoru. There are also 2 other arcs as I know of. I still have episodes 79-86 to watch so I'm pretty sure. The other arcs are the Christian and Divine Elixer arcs. The Christian arc is the best one, except the final battle sort of sucks. Anyhow, you'll see what I mean. Happy watching!!!",1086048000,3,700,4.2706766917293235
2043591,4,B0001Z3IJO,"Like some other viewers, I believe that this arc of the series wasn't needed. In fact I would have rather had the producers of Rurouni Kenshin animate the Jinchuu Arc due to the fact that the Jinchuu Arc wasn't just a huge set of filler episodes and concentrates mostly on one central villian (Enishi). All of the discs (with the exception of the magic crap) were good, but not as good as the filler episodes from the wandering samurai were. Also the magic crap totally ruined the ending of the series, Rurouni Kenshin is supposed to be realistic (to a point). Other than that this arc was pretty good.

FIREFLY'S WISH: 9/10

I have to admit that I do love the Rurouni Kenshin filler episodes and this disc is what the rest of the Meiji Arc should have been like if they were just going to use filler episodes for an arc.

CHRISTIAN SAGA: 7.5/10

This saga was merely decent, with some highlights, but it just didn't have the excitement that the Legend of Kyoto Arc did and also had some unrealistic things in it. Come on, knocking Misao out with a light from his sword?

DREAMS OF YOUTH: 8.5/10

Yet another good filler episode with action and some seriously funny stuff.

BLACK KNIGHTS SAGA: 8/10

Good arc, but the magic elixer and the part where Sano moves the pillars and the water sinks is kind of unrealistic.

MAGIC CRAP: 4/10

This saga doesn't even deserve a review.

OVERALL: 8/10

I was able to stomach everything except the Magic Crap and if you can stomach 1 and 4/5 disc of crap out of eight discs, then this disc is a pretty good buy. I didn't like the ending though because it just leaves you hanging, but hopefully the Jinchuu Arc won't.",1135987200,,1655,4.461794019933555
2043592,5,B0001Z3IJO,Kenshin has learned the ultimate sword technique of the Hiten Mitsurugi Style and defeated his enemies from the time of the Revolution. Now he is a man ready to face the new era in Japan. But Kenshin still must cross swords with many new opponents and deadly ninjas!,1128729600,,266,4.5625
2043593,2,B0001Z3IJO,"This third installment of Rurouni Kenshin is all right, but not great. It has the same good ole humor, but the enemies are very different. The previous episodes tried to be somewhat realistic in their action and events, nothing very magical. In the Meiji Era, though, the events were extremely far fetch, from finding the Elixir to the flow of this huge electic wave of Chi running all over Japan. All strings to reality were chopped off.

The Legend of Kyoto had a fantastic ending with a huge, epic battle. Unfortunately, the series never reached the same amount of adrenaline in action. It didn't even come close. I also greatly missed Saitou. I never saw him again after Legend of Kyoto. He made the set of characters perfect with his awesome lack of pity.

If you want to keep a good impression of Ruruoni Kenshin, do not buy this DVD box. If you must know how it ends, then borrow it from a friend.",1106697600,8,904,4.5060975609756095
2043594,5,B0001Z3IJO,"What can I say? KENSHIN ROCKS!! not only is one of my favorite animes of all times but it's also got an amazing soundtrack!! the songs are sooo goooddd!! some are weird but once you listen to them over and over they grow on you! KICK ASS ANIME!! GO BUY IT RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!! It's funny (EXTREMELY HILARIOUS at times), interesting, it's got amazing plot that entertains you but does not go over the top drama or anything, and also has kick ass fights that leave you wanting more! I love it!!! Kenshin and all the characters in this anime are presented in a way that they seem real, and by the end of every episode you end up loving them even more. It's something you are going to want to have for ever .. seriously I see myself still watching this anime when im 90 :D

probably the best anime of all times people ... go buy itt!!",1103587200,5,827,4.234177215189874
2043595,1,B0001Z3IJO,This really wasn't worth the money.... I have been a avid reader of the original manga and this does it no justice. What were they trying to do with this season....,1097625600,2,164,4.32258064516129
2043596,2,B0001Z3IJO,"Well,

the third season is just a bunch of episodes thrown together . I am a huge fan of rk I was wondering why everyone on amazon was so hard on this series. The first part of the series deals with Japanese society and chirsitanity. It gets kinds disturbing at parts, but it was ok. Then that kid who was sent to germany beacuase rijutta cut his arm is back, and he and the doctor who saves him are looking for some exlir ( it was ok) The worst part for me was the fung shui crap- i stull don't understand whats that about i thought feng shi was a decorating style. I have never had to stuggle to watch a kenshin episode ever!!

I am just hoping that they translate the manga with enishi since they aren't going to make it into a series

Overal it was ok, but you have to be a huge huge huge , and let me say this one more time huge!! fan to even like this boxset.

It was cool at the start, and confusing at the finsish

the last episode wasn't anything either, I suggest you get samurai x reflection for a better ending ( even though that was a sad one too)",1097280000,5,1060,4.004739336492891
2043597,5,B0001Z3IJO,"Yes the series ends here, as much as I hate to admit it is the end of the rurouni kenshin series. These are just filler episodes but it still has the special qualaty that I like about Rurouni Kenhsin. There is romance,action, and comedy. There is no need to get this but if you are a complete Rurouni Kenshin like me get it because you just might go on a long road trip and you might need to watch something.",1094342400,,408,4.1125
2043598,1,B0001Z3IJO,Whenever money is involved in things it always complicates life. Rurouni Kenshin- the wandering samurai story arc and -legend of kyoto story arcs are without a doubt masterpieces. Then they put this out only because the comic book (or manga) wasn't finished yet with the real story arc which is true and an eventful drama tale at its best. The real story is that of ...well I don't want to spoil it for those who don't know; but has to do deeply with Kenshin's past and also the story tells the fate of Kenshin's and Kaoru's Love. The producers of the show have eternally messed up the author's masterpiece of the legendary manslayer who stop's killing. The whole time I was thinking what the heck? this isn't kenshin where's the depth of the characters??? The only way now that they (the production company) can fix it and atone for there sins is to wander up some mulla and make another season and finish the real story. IF YOU ARE NOT A SUPER FAN OF RUROUNI KENSHIN DO NOT BUY THIS SEASON. The samurai x episodes does more justice than this box set(even though the voices suck and are not the same aS those in the series) but still for those who need to know kenshin's fate buy Samurai X Trust and Betrayal and then Reflection or wait for the manga to come out in the US. Thank you for your time.,1092700800,17,1299,4.394190871369295
2043599,4,B0001Z3IJO,"to get right to the point, as far as i have researched there is not a fourth season. the series is ended with the ova Reflections. in reflections it explains about enishi, and and gives a final solution to the series. i'm not going to spoil it by telling what however. i can only rate off what i have read and previewed, so sorry if you don't like it. i'm still going to get the third bowset.",1090627200,6,392,4.103896103896104
8018508,5,B0001Z3IJO,Box made to look like wood with an elegant print on the cover this is the third and final part of the Kenshin series. The dvd's themselves come two dvd's to a paper sleeve.,1392854400,,172,4.088235294117647
8018509,5,B0001Z3IJO,"This is probably my most favorite Anime series, this is just one of the box sets but the whole series is great.

8018511,3,B0001Z3IJO,Enishi should be in it... His part in the storyline was invaluable and very rich.,1185062400,,81,4.466666666666667
8018512,5,B0001Z3IJO,"Chances are that you saw RK on toonami back in the day and that's why you're thinking about investing 120 or so per season in getting this.  For the anime, it's definately worth it.  The quality of the dvd's is really nice and that should be good enough to get this.  The only beef I have with the box set is the packaging.  Every 2 dvd's comes in a really nice looking container, however instead of having the nice plastic standard cd clasp to keep the disks locked in, these are simple non padded turn it upsidedown and the dvd falls out sorta cases that are just begging you to scratch up the disks.  If you plan on watching these over and over I'd suggest getting a cd case to put the dvds in and and tuck the box somewhere safe.",1171324800,,733,4.170212765957447
8018513,3,B0001Z3IJO,"Indeed, all 33 episodes literally had nothing to do with the Rurouni Kenshin storyline. Apparently the producers wanted to start making up their own stories using the Kenshin characters, and it lead to a series of mediocre ""filler"" episodes. This finally resulted to the cancellation of the series, and the final chapter was never animated! In case you're wondering, the final chapter was supposed to take place during the revolution, and elaborates on how Kenshin (known as the Battousai) received his scars, and probably has the Shinsengumi more involved, etc. It's a shame that the producers got greedy and decided to drag the series out with forgettable episodes until it died. The final chapter sounded very promising...

Besides of the hilarious episodes that had nothing to do with anything, there was virtually nothing worth rewatching, but I'll just talk about the jist of the series. There are pretty much 3 major events that take place. The first is about a Christian swordsman that learned the Hiten Mitsurugi Style from a fallen apprentice who failed his chance at being Sejuro Hiko the 12th. The second event was about the Black Knights that sought after a magical exilir of some sort, which turned out to be some plants. And the 3rd was a totally bogus event about a supernatural magic spell that had been dormant within magical seals carved around Tokyo in the past. I highly won't recommend watching this more than once just to see how it is. If you've finished enjoying the other 2 arcs and don't want to have a bad taste toward the Kenshin series as a whole, you might as well stop at episode 62 o_o.",1154304000,,1619,4.802867383512544
8018514,4,B0001Z3IJO,"The Meiji Era is kind of like the first season - lots of small stories put together with a few episodes that stand alone.  Christian cults, German knights, Ninja clans, more fighting styles (some even from Europe).  The art work, camera style and appearance of some characters from the other seasons helps bring it all together even with the lack of a season long story.  The last episode's use of real photographs and film footage mixed with the anime cells really brings it to a lovely and heart warming close.

The wandering samurai, Rurouni Kenshin, returns to the place where he started in the first season.  A place he can call home.",1146960000,,639,4.669642857142857
8018515,3,B0001Z3IJO,"I did enjoy this season,There was good parts in it, but there was just too many characters that were easily forgotten, and way too much unrealistic magic [...](for the time period of 1878). The worst of all was the final episodes with all that fung shui [...] That just ruined it. The final episode wasn't all the great either, it just left you hanging...",1144886400,,355,4.5625
8018516,3,B0001Z3IJO,"I'm a tremendous Kenshin Himura fan and would have bought this season despite the nature of this review.  I own pretty much the whole saga as portrayed and lack only 1 CD, but feel its my duty to pass on my insights as to how Kenshin Himura's Saga unfolded in all likelihood.

As detailed elsewhere, there are essentially three story lines in the third season:  The Rougue Hitan Mitsurougi journeyman; German knights; and Chinese Feng Shui Masters.  Unlike seasons 1 & 2 the plot line bears only a mere trivial historical relevance.

The feel of the season is that they fired the Genius that came up with the original concept, and everyone else struggled to do their part to pull off the rest of the season.  The guy they fired was responsible for coming up with the technical aspects of Japanesse swordsmanship along with the plot line. As a result we find several instances where there are serious lapses in what we know as the Hitan Mitsurougi style.  One instance would be when Kenshin attacks the German on the horse with the Mitsurougi style incorporating 9 attacks at once. The knight shows that he was wearing plate male underneath his tunic, but he was only briefly phased despite the fact that of the 9 attacks three would have been to the head and the thighs.  In my humble opinion, he should have been blown off the horse...  All in all, there is sort of a dragon ball Z feel to the whole season due to all the unbelievable action / magical effects used.

Last two points: You can watch the Genius' version of the end of he season in Sumaria X Remembrance.  And the third seaon does an excellant job of tying off the relationship between Kenshin and Kaoru. Evidently they didn't fire the editor in charge of the touchy-feely aspects of the show...",1137801600,,1759,4.570063694267516
