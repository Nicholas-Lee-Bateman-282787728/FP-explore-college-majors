656301,5,6303471641,"Under Fire, 1983 film

When the popular revolt in Nicaragua against Somoza attracted world attention in the late 1970s, many journalists went there to report the news. One journalist made world news when he was murdered by government forces, and another reporter filmed this event. This 1983 movie weaves this incident into a story about those days.

The scene in Nicaragua starts with a parade. Rebels infiltrate and hoist a banner; the military chase them. This is photographed by a journalist who climbs on top of a parked car. (NEVER park your car by a parade route!) The rebels invade a night club, a grenade goes off, and then Russell ""visits"" the police station. A ""businessman"" gets him released, and then suggests that Russell visit the provincial capital where the Sandinistas are active. Russell photographs the action, and gets involved. The pitching skills of a Nicaraguan are used, but he is soon retired from this game.

Back in the capital Somoza announces the death of the rebel Commander, Rafael. Russell visits this province to photograph the news. He meets the rebel leaders, and agrees to photograph Rafael in a live setting; others in the rebel camp are photographed. The movie shows how ancient DC-3s are used as military weapons. Alex returns and asks to visit Rafael. Russell discovers that his photos are being used to identify and eliminate the rebels! When Alex can't find Rafael, he wants to do a story on the ""businessman"". But Alex is prevented from doing this by unidentified soldiers. Russell photographs this, but escapes with his life. The film gets back to the hotel, and is published. Somoza flees the country, and lands in Miami. And so it finally ends happily? Or does it? Could such a movie be made today?

The romantic triangle (older man, younger woman, younger man) reminds me of ""The Quiet American"".",1437609600,,1844,4.919614147909968

So, when I write my little blurb I try to let people in on the following:  Is it a good price for the content, script, picture and so forth.  Under Fire is taken from a true event and I could not be sure if it is completely dead on, but I kind of doubt it.  I did like it and would highly recommend it as a really good value.

656405,5,6303471641,"I don't know why the cover of Twilight Time's Blu-ray disc release with the original film poster features harsh contrasts, but it's good to see that the high definition quality of the film on this Blu-ray in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio (and stereo sound) is impeccable, free of any edge enhancement or digital degradations and rich in contrast and half tones.

Among the special features are three separate and exclusive audio tracks (available under ""setup""):

Audio track one features the isolated Jerry Goldsmith score and foley effects.

Audio track two contains a feature length audio commentary with no one less than the films director, and Roger Spottiswoode shares plenty of interesting production memories and anecdotes, ranging from hilarious to outright scary (this could have almost been Gene Hackmans last film), and interesting reflections about filmmaking, then and now.

The third audio track focuses in-depth on the accomplishments and life achievement of composer Jerry Goldsmith, not only his score for UNDER FIRE, undeniably one of his best, but his other works as well. Highly recommended for friends and fans of his music, I learned a couple of things I wasn't aware of previously.

Curiously, I found the original theatrical trailer to be of particular interest, not only because it apparantly features one of the first CGI films ever (a falling and spinning roll film) but also two incorrect claims (admittedly, the true Somoza lie would have given away the films climax).

I'm happy that one of my all time favorite films has finally received the ""royal"" Blu-ray / HD treatment.",1416268800,,1608,5.165384615384616
656406,5,6303471641,"Under Fire is one of the few mainstream American `political' movies to emerge from the studio system, but along with Missing it's probably the best. On one level it grafts a traditional romantic triangle onto its story of American war correspondents in Nicaragua gradually finding themselves drawn to taking sides instead of taking pictures, but at least it's a convincingly grown-up relationship that allows Nick Nolte, Gene Hackman and a never better Joanna Cassidy to really shine. It's a shame that Cassidy never got more opportunities like this: a last-minute replacement for Julie Christie, she's extraordinarily good here. The film also boasts an impressive supporting cast, with a star-making turn from Ed Harris as an amiable but deadly mercenary a standout, although Jean-Louis Tritignant's deceptively unsubtle CIA man gives him a run for his money (not so much for his performance - his English was non-existent and it's obvious he's learned his lines phonetically - but because he has most of the film's best dialogue). Extremely well directed by Roger Spottiswoode with a promise he never really fulfilled, it's an impressive albeit slightly partisan portrait of a country decaying in the last stages of revolution and also boasts what is possibly Jerry Goldsmith's finest score (which is saying quite something). Impressive stuff.

It was always a shame that so little effort has went into the DVD, which offered no more than a trailer, but Twilight Time's Region-free limited edition Blu-ray goes a long way to rectifying that. Along with visibly improved picture quality there are two commentary tracks - one with director Roger Spottiswoode, editor Paul Seydor and photographer and technical advisor Matthew Naythons covering the production of the film, the other with Bruce Botnik, Kenny Hall and Jeff Bond discussing Jerry Goldsmith's score, which also features on its own isolated music and effects track (the original master tapes are missing, one reason there has never been an extended soundtrack album), brief interview with Joanna Cassidy, booklet and the film's excellent theatrical trailer.

656475,4,6303471641,"Watched a couple gritty dramas from 1982-83.

Under Fire (1983)

Inspired by the 1979 murder of reporter Bill Stewart in Nicaragua, Under Fire is a serious bit of filmmaking that I fear may lose power as it ages due to the period politics. Does anyone remember the Sandinistas? Maybe it doesn't matter. Seems like the U.S. Government is propping up another despot somewhere around the world every couple years. That naked truth, and its immoral bedfellow, the ability of The Press to shape (or indeed, make) the news, will gnaw at you after watching this film, if it doesn't already.

Fearsome performance by Nick Nolte. He owns this film. Whatever happened to him? Just a Hawaiian shirt and a mugshot? Shame. Supporting cast is strong, too, including Joanna Cassidy and Gene Hackman, and Ed Harris in a minor role.

Under Fire is realistic and dirty. Perhaps not quite as disturbing as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midnight-Express/dp/B000ZM1MGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midnight Express</a>, but still lots of emotional weight here.

656480,5,6303471641,"Very easy review personally knowing Keith and his family.  His father was a Marine & WWII PoW Taken on Corregidor.  His Son Keith who is portrayed in the film is Marine, former LEO and CIA. Keiths son is a Marine, Gulf War 1 Vet and now Leo.  The narrator Carlton Sherwood is also a friend.  He is also the author/narrator of the controversial film, Stolen Honor:  Wound That Never Heal.

This is a must see video.

Hall was sent to Bierut by the CIA's paramilitary division to investigate the 1983 Beirut bombing of the US Embassy. Hall (a former Marine) managed to survive in the hell hole of Beirut, and tied the embassy bombing to Iran, the PLO and the scum of Hezbollah. After risking his life for this country he returned to CIA headquarters. CIA headquarters then proceeded to tell Keith that no one in the CIA or Reagan administration was willing to take action against Hezbollah or Iran. Keith was then actually investigated for the rough interrogation tactics he used against the bombing suspects in Lebanon, and was then fired by the CIA.

Every current and former Marine is well aware of the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut that occured in late 1983. Kieth Hall had provided the CIA with intel that could have led to the prevention of this horrible attack, if only the CIA had followed up on it.

This is one of the most disgracefull episodes in CIA and American history. The fact that America did nothing to prevent this bombing, and then did nothing to avenge the embassy and Marine barracks bombing is an unjustifiable act of cowardice from a country that has spawned the greatest and most potent military in history.

Keith Hall: this man was treated disgracefully by an agency and a nation he served so honorably, I can only hope that this program will serve to let Americans know that thier are people like him who are America's greatest asset.

It is good that Kieth's story is being told perhaps now he will be granted the respect and admiration that he so much deserves.

A good follow up read to this would be The Dark Art of Interrogation, The most effective way to gather intelligence and thwart terrorism can also be a direct route into morally repugnant terrain.

The film is offbeat, takes place in a foreign country in the throes of a civil war, and captures the harrowing efforts of photojournalists to capture a story, often putting their lives on the line to do so. The Revolution and its mysterious leader is the main story, with the rivalry between Nolte and Hackman for Cassidy a secondary story. You get to see some of the conflicts between the reporter in the field trying to catch that one perfect picture that tells a story vs. the news readers that read us the story from the safety of a New York studio. The music is entrancing and the chaos intrinsic to revolutions is deftly captured. And there is a gritty reality in Hackman's demise at the hands of soldados in a crappy country in the middle of a violent civil war. What the revolutionaries want Nolte to do is emblematic of efforts to spin stories and generate propaganda, sometimes to keep the very revolution alive.

It's hard to find footage of ""unpopular wars"" - particularly those that run counter to US interests. What I like most about this film is how we see what it was like on the streets of Nicaragua... the kind of battles going on and the way the poor and the soldiers - on both sides - looked and acted.

I think it is a shame that this film was put down by reviewer D. MacKenzie ... the Sandinistas were not, as far as I can tell, much like the sorry lot of the East Bloc nations tied directly to Moscow. The sad thing is that the US - by attacking and isolating Latin American countries that turn against the interests of corporations - forced some to seek help wherever they could. Fortunately Nicaragua never was a nasty place to be - like in Cuba. From what one sees in the film, the Sandinistas were perhaps more like the rebels in Mexico, Argentina and Venezuela, and not at all like the brutal and bloodthirsty guerillas in Columbia and Peru. It is a shame they never were allowed to go in their own direction, independent of the US or Moscow.

Another great film people who like this one will enjoy is Ken Loach's ""Carla's Song"".",1104710400,6,1215,4.232758620689655
656704,2,6303471641,"Under Fire is certainly a well made and well acted film. There is some real history in this movie as well. The most accurate history is that of the brutality of the Samoza regime. However, the directors shot the scenes of the Sandinistas through a rose colored lens.
When the Frenchman (played by Jean-Louis Trintignant) is about to be executed by the Sandinistas he says that Samoza is a butcher too, but in 20 years we will know who is right. It has been 20 years and we now know that the cause that this movie glorifies was a colossal failure. The fall of the Berlin wall made this film's perspective laughable. In recent years Nicaragua has been moving towards freer markets. So much for the revolution.
The passage of time has revealed the absurdity of how those who made this movie saw these events. Nolte, Harris, and Hackman delivered fine performances, but hindsight makes it hard to take this film seriously, as its producers obviously intended. You can watch these actors deliver fine performances in other films, so there is no need to entertain the absurd portrayal of Marxist inspired revolutionaries in Under Fire.",1085961600,14,1129,4.794871794871795
656705,3,6303471641,"This 1983 film is about journalists in war-torn Nicaragua where President Somoza is losing his power to Sandinista guerillas.  Nick Nolte, Joanna Cassidy and Gene Hackman are cast as the journalists. They all love the adventure of their assignments and view the wars as way to establish esteem by having a story on the cover of Time magazine. They're also involved in a love triangle.  In the meantime there is the real tragedy of the war going on around them.  Nick Nolte has to make some hard choices about his integrity and it made me think about what I might do in the same situation.  Ed Harris is cast as an American mercenary and made me aware that such people really do exist.

There's danger and adventure and history here - all rolled up into one film.  I just wish they left out the silly romance that slowed down the action.  I was much more interested in the politics which seemed an over-simplified ""good guys versus bad guys"" story.  All the actors did a competent job with the exception of Joanna Cassidy who tried hard but just wasn't believable.  The cinematography was great though and really gave me a feeling of the place they were in.  Some of the opening scenes were set in Africa, and these, too, were excellent.

I generally liked this film but stop short of giving it a high recommendation.  I just couldn't care about the characters or the particular war in progress.  Good but not great.",1075766400,8,1415,4.589641434262949

656707,5,6303471641,"This flick should have won a lot of oscars - for screenplay, direction, acting, cinematography and music.  Nick Nolte, Joanna Cassidy and Gene Hackman are riveting as war zone journalists; Ed Harris plays a mercenary soldier just right, with hedonistic aplomb.
One interesting aspect that runs through the film is how multi-national corporations profit no matter who wins at war; they'll always be there reaping profits.  Another long thread running through the film is how American foreign policy is designed to broaden and protect OUR interests without taking into wider consideration the impact we have on the citizens of other countries, particularly the developing countries or those nations governed by unpopular dictatorships.
I saw this flick 20 years ago and it's stayed with me ever since, the mark of a good movie.  This film is what propelled me to earn degrees in international relations and journalism. Most films these days are for teenagers, but not this one.  It's complex and thought-provoking and entertaining throughout.  I want my wife to see it.",1045440000,44,1067,5.216374269005848

Two American journalists get caught up in the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua. The cause they sympathize with is a good one, but they let their emotions overcome their professional objectivity. They commit a BIG ethics violation (you might ask, ""do journalists have a code of ethics?""), when they're ""hired"" to take a photograph of the national revolutionary hero who, as far as his supporters around the country know, may or may not be dead. They fall in love with the revolution and each other, their friend and colleague is murdered by Tacho's henchmen, they are chased by the murderous henchmen, but escape, and all ends happily when the Revolution triumphs.
One part of the story is based on fact: journalist Bill Stewart was murdered by the Nicaruguan National Guard in 1978, sparking some long-over due non-covert American interest in the Nicaraguan civil war.",1032134400,,912,5.12751677852349
