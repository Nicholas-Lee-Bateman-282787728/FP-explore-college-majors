3555400,5,B001EKUKOG,"My three year old loves, loves, loves this dvd (and the Milkshake CDs), and I can stand it too! Very catchy tunes, fun videos, all around excellent.",1227139200,,148,4.518518518518518
8298528,5,B001EKUKOG,My kids love this band and have been listening to them since they were 2 years old.  Now 5 my son still watches any DVD they're in and listens to their music regularly. They are fun to watch and listen to. If your kids like music DVD's this is a great buy!,1319500800,,256,3.923076923076923
8298529,5,B001EKUKOG,"My child absolutely loves this DVD. I wish Milkshake would make another one. We first heard there music on ""Jack's Big Music Show."" Unlike a lot of children's music which is pure torture for adults to listen to, Milkshake is catchy and enjoyable while still being completely age appropriate.",1264204800,,291,4.959183673469388
8298530,5,B001EKUKOG,"Loved the music from the first song. videos were so much fun. from the first song my kids were up dancing along.  two of my kids have autism, and the rhythm of the tunes seemed to draw them in.  Even the grown ups watching participated, it felt like a folksy rock concert not at all like a bunch of baby songs.  Lisa is the coolest, I can't wait for another music video!",1263340800,,370,4.111111111111111
8298531,5,B001EKUKOG,"Just like all the Milkshake songs, this DVD is pure fun!  Most kid stuff makes adults cringe, but not this!  This was my Christmas gift to all my nieces and nephews (who already have Milkshake CD's AND every gimmicky toy in the universe).  They all LOVE it (and so do their parents).  One told me how much she appreciates the fact that Milkshake doesn't ""talk down"" to her kids like some of the kid TV music acts do.  They all range in age from 2 to 10, but I won't reveal the ages of the adults who like it too.  :)",1233273600,,516,4.0594059405940595
8298532,5,B001EKUKOG,"Seeing Milkshake perform live is one of the great feel-good experiences my kids and I have shared -- and this DVD is the next best thing!  Intelligent, infectious music, imaginative videos, cool behind-the-scenes footage, the unbeatable energy of Lisa and her band, and high-production values make this DVD a must!",1233187200,,314,5.28
8298533,5,B001EKUKOG,"I enjoyed this DVD almost as much as my 5-year old.  We listen Milkshake CDs in the car all the time and my son was very excited to be able to watch now, too.  The DVD is fun to watch - as good as anything on Noggin or Disney.  We love it.",1233187200,,239,3.5576923076923075
8298534,5,B001EKUKOG,"This DVD is a collection of videos accompanying the melodic songs of the well-known and beloved children's music band, Milkshake.  All of the tunes represent Milkshake's aesthetic, which focuses on witty and thoughtful lyrics and very hummable tunes with memorable choruses that are far more rockin' (albeit in a gentle way) than the genre's usual simple ditties accompanied only by acoustic guitar strumming. While the music appropriately focuses on the warm and heartfelt vocals of lead singer and main songwriter Lisa Matthews, the multi-instrumentalist band members all make strong contributions to vocal and musical arrangements as well as adding lots of harmonies and backing support.  The videos are really fun, with the band members all participating in different settings, as in one instance where they dress up as pirates on a ship. Also, the videos are interspersed with clips of the band clowning around backstage before a concert, thereby adding intimacy and allowing a young viewer to feel that he or she has a personal connection with the band.  At a Milkshake concert which I attended, it was also clear that the parents were enjoying the music as much as their dancing children.  As to the reviewer who awarded this DVD only one star, while she is certainly entitled to her opinion and I regret that she was disappointed, I have to confess to puzzlement as to why an 11 MONTH old baby is already watching lots of television, be it music videos or otherwise.  To me, the better age range for kids would be from 18 (or 24) months up to about 8 years old, give or take.  Overall, highly recommended.",1233100800,2,1613,4.911764705882353
8298535,5,B001EKUKOG,"By far the best kids music out there and the adults love it too!  The videos are creative and fun and full of action!
My kids can't get enough of Milkshake!  I highly recommend this and the Milkshake cds.",1233100800,,204,4.205128205128205
8298536,5,B001EKUKOG,"What's great about this collection of Milkshake Videos of their songs is that:
 a) The Music is well-written: It has musicality. And as listeners of their children's music often find out, this isn't always the case with ""kid's music"". I mean, the arrangement in ""Imagination Nation"" for example sounds Beatle-ish in their more experimental period with the great vocal harmonies. And the video that goes with that particular song is trippy!  All their songs contain lyrics that are Positive and Warm while not being condescending and cover a wide range of concerns, emotions and interests of kids. I dare the adults to try and Not sing along after a few plays of this DVD.
 b) The Videos are all great, with a combination of fun live-action accompaniment by the band on various escapades and playfulness along with concert footage in some, and great animation in a few others.

Production value is high. I strongly recommend this, as it is heads and tails above most other kids music entertainment out there.

Buy this!",1233100800,,1018,4.895348837209302
8298537,1,B001EKUKOG,I bought this cd because my daughter who is eleven months loves Jacks big music show.  Milkshake has a couple of really cute songs and videos on it so I thought this would be like that.  It is not at all like that.  Maybe when she is older she will like this but I don't recommend it for this age or younger.  They have interviews with the band between songs and the videos are a little wierd.  Not anything like the ones they have done for Jacks Big Music Show.,1231632000,,462,4.088888888888889
