7769831,5,B01GWC3G1O,"Tim Hawkins is just Tim Hawkins.  You can expect parodies of songs and lots of funny in between.  This one reminded me a lot of Full Range of Motion in the song to stand-up routine pattern.  I thought it was well done.  My husband and I were in tears several times.  We just can't get enough of Tim.  Buy it.  There is all new material.  Nothing was taken from a previous DVD.  You can see excerpts of the video on Tim's website, but don't ruin the movie.  Just get it.  If you are even considering this product, you obviously already love Tim Hawkins or have at least heard of him.  Get it.  You won't be sorry.",1361923200,18,612,4.172413793103448

His video is also available to download (HD!) on his website timhawkins.net for only $5! I can live without the DVD for that price!

7769917,5,B01GWC3G1O,"We are somewhat new fans of Tim Hawkins and this DVD was his most hilarious yet (we haven't seen his newest one, can't wait to get it!).  I read some of the negative reviews and cannot wrap my head around people thinking this is crude or not for the kids or family.  Completely NOT true!  I would feel comfortable watching this with anyone - Christian, non-Christian, kids, adults, you-name-it and only the ultra-sensitive or people with no sense of humor would think otherwise, because you would have to be made of stone not to laugh through this whole DVD.  One of our family members does not like ""religious stuff"" and he loved Tim and laughed as hard as we did all the way through it.  My mother-in-law was very sick when we all watched it, yet she laughed a lot and even when she fell asleep, she had this big smile on her face.  It was so cute.  Laughter truly is the best medicine.  Tim is incredibly talented and I could not recommend this DVD enough",1420675200,,958,4.403409090909091

7769997,3,B01GWC3G1O,"We have watched Tim Hawkins as a family and really enjoyed the DVDs we have purchased so far.  My husband and I are not as impressed with this video.  Husband and wife jokes are OK, but sometimes marriages have enough strain than to add pokes and pranks from a comedian too.  This DVD isn't geared toward spoofing the old songs like a few of his others. Yes, there are some laughs to be had, but not near as many for us as the ""Insanitized"" and one or two of the others - just can't remember the names.",1403913600,2,502,4.154639175257732

7770078,5,B01GWC3G1O,"Tim is so funny, I think it's because he is so easy to relate to.  He finds humor in everyday things, but with his own twist.  You will laugh till you cry.",1386028800,,155,3.8125
7770079,5,B01GWC3G1O,"Tim never dissapoints, and this DVD is the latest craziness he offers. He is side splittingly funny, whether you are a christian or not.

7770081,2,B01GWC3G1O,"I did not enjoy the seemingly endless songs at the beginning, and feel he went too far in his criticisms of different religions.  Yes, he normally pokes fun at varying denominations; but there were a few that I think would have made the particular audience members quite uncomfortable.  Not sure I'll watch this again.",1383436800,5,318,4.87037037037037

7770083,2,B01GWC3G1O,I had church friends over with kids ranging from 3-21 and I was very embarrassed by the jokes.  He has songs about colonoscopies and other things that children do not understand.  His older DVDs are much better.

And I'm not just saying this because I think our current President would bring a bowl, rather than a box if asked by the First Lady (the DVD will clear this thought up for you).  You must, for the sake of our great nation, purchase and watch this DVD!

7770151,4,B01GWC3G1O,"Once again, Tim Hawkins is a master comedian.  I now own all of his DVD's.  I am only rating this one a 4 out of 5 because there were actually some parts of the DVD that I did not think were that funny.  On all of the previous four DVDs, he had me laughing to the point of tears pretty much throughout the ENTIRE comedy routine.  He is that funny.  On this most recent comedy routine, there were a few jokes that I did not really think were as funny as previous material.  It must be getting very challenging for him to produce new and exciting material year after year.  I would still love to see him in person.
