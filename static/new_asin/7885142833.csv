1141027,3,7885142833,"Warning this film does contain some `fighting'. This is a full on version of the legend that is Guan Yu (Donnie Yen), he was famous in Ancient China for his prowess in the civil war and the eventual ousting of the Han Dynasty. It does help if you know a bit about the actual history as there was a lot of information crammed into the 109 minutes of film. It starts with a brilliant set piece battle and then gets into the political machinations that become the scene setter for the rest of the film.

There is also a love interest where Guan Yu falls for the concubine of his blood brother, and she gets into scrapes with a rapidity that even Scooby Doo would baulk at. But he is always there to rescue her. There are some who have said this is not a martial arts film, but for me it was more or less constant and to be honest a bit boring in its' repetitiveness. Whilst it is beautifully shot and the soundtrack is both emotive and impressive, the plot comes across as contrived. There are crosses and double crosses and people change sides almost randomly.

The real strength, or weakness depending on your point of view , are the action sequences. They are many and frequent. They normally involve Guan Yu fighting an army single handed whilst flying about the place to a dubbed on `fight soundtrack'. There is some wire work too, but I always find that mildly comic or annoying - people only fly in aeroplanes or by accidents. The sub titles are also an issue, they are in white and are quite often obscured by the back ground which means you can miss some plot development.

There are also just so many plot holes, I especially like the way Guan masters the art of semi-automatic crossbow firing in a nano second. Everything seems to be a prelude for more fighting and it is the sort where inevitably one person at a time comes forward to do battle, and no-one stabs anyone in the back. I started popping out to put the kettle on when these started, as I always hate it when you know what the outcome would be. There was no attempt at subtlety except in the rather good performance of Wen Jiang who played the Machiavellian Cao Cao who managed to be both hero and villain often in the same scene.

If you like a martial arts flick then you could do a lot worse, it has clearly had a lot of money spent on it and has many qualities and I was not bored, but the points I mention above meant that for me it was really only ok, hence the rating.",1324339200,,2446,4.299349240780911
1141028,5,7885142833,"This movie is an historic epic, based on the legendary history of Guan Yu, from the Three Kingdoms period of ancient China. While it may not be history in the strictest sense, it is a very humanizing and well done take of portraying Cao Cao and his relationship with Guan Yu.

I know that Donnie loves MMA, and after a couple of very successful portrayals on screen, (SPL, Flashpoint, Chen Zhen) I must admit, I love watching him do more traditional styles of kung fu. Yen's guan dao wielding is both beautiful and powerful on screen. I strongly feel that this is some of Donnie's best choreography (action director). His agility is astounding and showcased to good effect, especially in the final fight scene in the misty woods.

As a drama, the pairing of Yen with Jiang Wen was very strong. These two gentlemen are wonderful in their verbal sparring scenes. Both characters are sympathetic and well acted. Even the minor parts are very well cast.

The cinematography is wonderful, the soundtrack is very good, and the story is stellar. I highly recommend this film.",1323648000,6,1068,4.762162162162162

1141031,4,7885142833,This is a great film but the product is difficult to set up to display subtitiles as the menu is in Chinese. With a little trial and error you can engage the subtitles and it is well worth the frustration. I would have given the product 5 star except for this problem. The seller was very quick in delivering the product as it came a couple of days after ordering. He was very quick in reply to me and helped me find the subtitles.

1141032,5,7885142833,"I feel like a lot of people will either watch this movie either knowing Donnie Yen from Ip Man, or from seeing John Woo's Red Cliff.

Its fair to compare and contrast an actor, and also different renditions of the same source material (story), but the film needs to be viewed as its own artistic accomplishment, and on its own merits. Going into this film with this attitude I think will maximize your enjoyment of it. On its own, this film shines. The action is great, and it manages to condense a lot of source material into a single movie, unlike Red Cliff which spanned two already long films.

Donnie Yen is solid, and his action choreography (yes he was the action director) was good apart from one fight scene that was too dark. I'm a huge huge fan of the Ip Man franchise. You can't compare the action in this movie with the action in Ip Man because they are completely different films. Donnie Yen, though, shows why he's the most dynamic and capable martial arts actor in the world today. And unlike his competition, the guy can really act.

This DVD was a treat also. Great, picture quality and some special features. I would recommend this film and DVD to any action/asian/martial arts movie fan.",1314576000,21,1207,4.552995391705069
1141033,2,7885142833,"I was excited about this movie when it came out because of the stellar performance Donny Yen gave as a spearman in the Jet Li film Heroes, I thought I was going to see excellent saber work throughtout the movie. Well Donnys fight schemes weren't close to what I saw in Heroes and most of all his acting still hadn't come around yet. The film was slow and the story line went nowhere I didn't even finish watching it had to end it.",1312416000,6,430,4.192771084337349
1141034,5,7885142833,"Donnie Yen has been on a roll making one big-budget action film after another, and he just doesn't seem to let up. Here he takes on a huge, ambitious role based on the famous Chinese novel, THE ROMANCE OF THE THREE KINGDOMS. This is the same material that John Woo's ""RED CLIFF"" was based on, though the stories are completely different. The sets are gorgeous, the story and screenplay excellent, the action and special effects perfectly executed, and the cinematography breathtaking. The team that made this movie, from the actors to the crew are a who's who of Chinese cinema. This was not a project executed by rookies, and it shows. This DVD on Amazon is just as outstanding as the movie. It is an official release, will play in North America, has highly detailed picture with good contrast and sharpness even in dark scenes. English subtitles are removable and are excellent. The special feature ""MAKING OF"" documentary is also subtitled in English. There are two trailers also.",1310947200,47,983,4.857142857142857

1141424,3,7885142833,"Meh - this film starts off promising, and you can tell it's aiming for greatness, but it never quite comes together. It felt like the ingredients for greatness were all there, but the whole was less than the sum of its parts. I can't concur with the comparisons to ""Red Cliff"" - this film doesn't even come close.

Among other problems, the fight scenes were too long, too many, and too far-fetched to maintain suspension of disbelief. I'm a Wuxia fan-boy, so it's not like I require a high level of realism. Even still - there are only so many times one dude armed with a broom handle can wipe out an entire platoon before my eyes start rolling uncontrollably.

Also, the major characters never quite gel. We're left wondering what makes them tick. Maybe this is an intentional ploy to paint them as ""complex."" If so, it fails. The effect isn't an intriguing sense of complexity; it's the annoying sense of a story whose pretentious ambitions render it too insecure to just make a dang decision already.

And the ""love interest"" felt like just that - nothing substantial, just some obligatory, tangential material haphazardly tacked on to the ""real"" story. Call me as a sissy boy if you must, but I don't like ""love interests"" - I like love stories. The best Wuxia combines love story and action seamlessly, so neither can be easily separated from the other elements of the narrative.

The half-assed love story feels like even more of a wasted opportunity when you consider the actress is Sun Li (""Legend of Zhen Huan""). Here you have this powerful, versatile actress, and all she's given for 95% of the movie is ""Damsel in Distress."" I get that it's a Wuxia trope, but the good films do it with nuance and depth. In Wuxia, the best damsels in distress are also kick-ass soul sisters who will cut you for so much as looking at them crossways, then later throw themselves off a cliff for you as a sign of affection. Or something. Something more than just the bare stereotype. Not in this film. Then at the end, Li's character is the fulcrum of a major plot twist. Unsurprisingly, that twist goes over like a lead balloon. Boo.

Not a horrible movie, but overall a disappointment.",1487548800,,2180,4.622739018087855

1142202,4,7885142833,"""The Lost Bladesman"" (""Guan yun chang"") is a martial arts action film written and directed by Felix Chong and Alan Mak, a writers team behind a 2002 Hong Kong thriller ""Infernal Affairs."" Thickly bearded Donnie Yen (""Yip Man"") plays Guan Yun (- 219), a general in the last days of the Han Dynasty. Set in 200, about eight years before the events depicted John Woo's ""Red Cliff,"" ""The Lost Bladesman"" follows the heroic adventure story of Guan Yun, a legendary figure in Chinese history.

The opening part of ""The Lost Bladesman"" may be a little complicated. Donnie Yen's character Guan Yen, captured by a powerful warlord and chancellor of the Han Dynasty Cao Cao (Wen Jiang), temporarily agrees to fight for Cao Cao, a rival warlord of Liu Bei (Alex Fong), to whom Guan Yen serves. Cao Cao wants Guan Yen to remain with him, but being loyal to his sworn brother Liu Bei, Guan Yen leaves Cao Cao. Cao Cao, who respects Guan Yen, orders his men to let him go unharmed, but on his way Guan Yen is confronted by six generals.

As I said above, ""The Lost Bladesman"" is a martial arts action, and Donnie Yen (who also choreographed) shows what he can do in combat scenes, but those who are looking for intense action of ""Yip Man"" may be disappointed. Some action set-pieces are impressive, especially the one in which Yen is seen fighting against Andy On's general Kong Xiu, skillfully using a sword in a narrow walled path, but as a whole the film is about a drama between the characters whose belief and loyalty may cost them a life.

Donnie Yen's performance as a dramatic actor is not bad, but Wen Jiang portraying Cao Cao as a Machiavellian strategist (but not a villain) steals every scene he is in. Slightly disappointing is Betty Sun, who plays Qi Lan, concubine of Liu Bei and love interest. Her character is created for the film, but her role (and a flashback sequence about her past) is superfluous.

Fans of ""Romance of the Three Kingdoms"" may disagree, but I for one enjoyed myself watching ""The Lost Bladesman"" and its action set-pieces.",1331424000,4,2046,4.628099173553719
