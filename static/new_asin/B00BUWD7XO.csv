5676853,3,B00BUWD7XO,"William Castle was either a frustrated actor or an incurable ham, appearing in Mr. Sardonicus not once but twice, neither to good effect.  The film itself was decent enough without these unwanted intrusions.  The story involves a recluse, Baron Sardonicus (played by Guy Rolfe), needing facial repair.  He was scared silly while trying to retrieve a lottery ticket left moldering in a grave occupied by his father.  Apparently, the shock of seeing daddy half there drove the son into an apoplexy fit resulting in a little known disorder called smiley face.  To spare his wife (Audrey Dalton) the sight of his pickled puss, he sports a glamour mask most of the time (in reality, the actor put up a squawk about wearing the torturous makeup so they only used it when necessary).  As luck would have it, the wife just happened to have a former boyfriend, Sir Robert Cargrave (Ronald Lewis), who could possibly smooth the wrinkled puss back into shape if properly persuaded (torture is a dandy incentive).  Lurking throughout is Sardonicus' faithful servant (Oskar Homolka as Krull) willing to do anything for his master.  This dutiful one-eyed freak handily steals the movie and maintains his grip throughout, even during the unwelcomed pause at the end staring William Castle.  I liked this movie a lot; it's a hoot.  I wish I could say the same about the repugnant mess that joins it on this Blu-ray disc.  Co-produced by, co-written by, and starring L.Q. Jones, The Brotherhood of Satan is a low budget mess trying to be a horror movie.  Very little of it makes sense.  People in a small town are trapped, unable to exit.  Bodies begin to pile up in the local ice house.  Children have gone missing.  A couple with a child gain entry into the town, notice it's a loony bin, and try to leave, twice.  Their little girl disappears in a blink of an eye.  13 are required because the local geezer population are all Satanists requiring a new youthful look.  It's dreary, confusing, and hampered by Strother Martin's dual performance as kindly old Doc by day, crazy Satanist leader by night.  All the killings are done by toys that either retain their toy-like qualities or morph into actual size facsimiles.  This film is neither scary nor suspenseful.  Worse, it's stupid.  Only one star for it, four stars for Mr. Sardonicus.  Can't divide it, so it's down to three stars.  (At least it was cheap.)",1381190400,8,2396,4.785365853658536
5676854,3,B00BUWD7XO,"This review is for Mill Creek's bluray double feature of ""Mr. Sardonicus"" and ""Brotherhood Of Satan"".  I root for Mill Creek in general because they release interesting product and maintain a budget price point. Sardonicus looks and sounds great in bluray! The only extra bit is William Castle's on-camera in the ""fog of London"" intro to the film. Oddly, I have a DVD version of ""House On Haunted Hill"" that contains an elaborate trailer for Sardonicus...including the film's theatrical-release ""punish or not"" (thumbs up or thumbs down) vote by patrons gimmick back in the day. Curious that the trailer is absent here. Too bad. As for ""Brotherhood Of Satan"", it features the always noteworthy Strother Martin, but an uninspiring bluray ""look"" to the film. Just okay picture, as far as bluray goes. As for the movie? To each his own, but it made me feel like I was watching feature number two at a summer bargain drive-in. Nostalgia at best. Strange and low-budget. Dismissibe.  I recommend this twin-spin for ""Mr. Sardonicus"", for it's place in William Castle lore and spooky atmosphere. Plus great acting. A few scenes are more lurid than desirable. Not for kids. Castle hit the right niche (more on the fun/popcorn side of things) with ""House On Haunted Hill"" and ""13 Ghosts"".  ""Mr. Sardonicus"" is stylish horror. But not as much fun. Valiant and appreciated effort, Mill Creek, getting ""Mr. Sardonicus"" on bluray. But, extras DO matter. They are signs of attention to history and detail.",1378339200,3,1491,4.979919678714859
5676855,4,B00BUWD7XO,"I found the picture and sound to be very nice and clear for both movies.

I doubt the aspect ratio described of 1.85:1 for ""Mr. Sardonicus"" is accurate.  I have a widescreen television with its standard aspect ratio of 1.77:1 (16:9) television, yet there wasn't the slight letterboxing I would have expected.  The picture of ""Mr. Sardonicus"" fills the screen, so I suspect it was slightly zoomed in to fit my screen perfectly with the standard 1.77:1.

""The Brotherhood of Satan"" is described as being 2.35:1, and it appears to be accurate.

I doubt either movie will ever see a better transfer, so I gave it 4 stars.  I deducted one star because of the misleading aspect ratio description.",1377043200,,690,4.756302521008403

5676860,5,B00BUWD7XO,"These are two great low budget horror films that are unique, tell a great story, and are entertaining from start to finish. The remastering is superb and the detail is amazing. Mr. Sardonicus (1961) was one of William Castle's most original films, and you'll not want to take your eyes off the screen. Strother Martin's performance in The Botherhood of Satan as a coven leader is unforgettable. The nostalgia factor is huge especially if you can remember evenings at the drive-in theater in the 1960s.",1370044800,8,501,4.905882352941177
5676861,4,B00BUWD7XO,"I am a huge fan of William Castle. He was an A producer of B films. He comes through again in Mr. Sardonicus.  It is a solid film with some good performances, most notably from Oscar Homolka.  He is excellant as the servant. Brootherhood of Satan I felt was disjointed,and slow. Not a great film.  For a Blu-Ray no extras for either film.

Mr. Sardonicus well what can one add about William Castle except if you want to see a fitting tribute check out the 90's movie Matinee starring John Goodman. Mr. Sardonicus is pure Creepiness.",1431043200,,353,4.53125
8574387,4,B00BUWD7XO,"Reviewing Brotherhood of Satan

A wild classic Drive-in film of Satan Worship, old people and demented possessed killer kids. A fun watch of an old school setting. This 1971 low budget horror film is a perfect example of late night fare of ghoul hosted mayhem. Written, produced and yes starring L. Q. Jones. A legend in the world of cinema starring in many films by the iconic legend Director, the one and only Sam Peckinpah. A stable in the bad guy and character actor role. He seemed to own the 70s and 80s appearing in countless films. He also was a writer and producer for many films. His most notable acting role in a film is the classic masterpiece The Wild Bunch (1969). He also directed and adapted the screen play for the cult film A Boy and his Dog (1975). He was one of those actors you might not know his name but you know his face and that is the reality he holds.

Brotherhood of Satan is one those films that grows on you after watching it for a few times. Its low budget and yes a little cheesy but it tends to do what it needs to do after several viewings. It latches on and creates a cult status or guilty pleasure persona. Directed by Bernard McEveety who was famous for directing a lot of TV including the show Combat. He was also involved in another cult film The Return of Dracula. He had his talent in the likes of all the great 80s shows like In the Heat of the Night, Airwolf, Knight Rider, The Fall Guy, Buck Rogers, Incredible Hulk, Dukes of Hazard. On an interesting side note his son Stephen McEveety is a well known producer in Hollywood with such films as Braveheart and The Passion of the Christ.

I think the stand out acting performance has to go to Strother Martin who plays the Doc and ringleader of the Satan Worshippers. His performance is wild and truly over the top and twisted in all its low budget glory. Now Martin and L.Q. Jones where best friends and appeared together many times.

Martin was also a regular in Sam Peckinpahs films and also was a major character actor alongside many huge actors such as John Wayne. He was another one of those actors you don't know his name but you know his face when you see him and say, oh yeah that guy. I think many die-hard cinema lovers will know him from uttering the famous dialogue in Cool Hand Luke: ""What we've got here is failure to communicate."" He was a master at playing a villain. He had the look and the ultimate voice to ace the part of whatever he was acting in. He starred in the iconic film Who Shot Liberty Valance as truly a memorable character Floyd. He was a master talent in many films from The Wild Bunch, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, True Grit and just so much more. I loved him as the Satan worshiping, kidnapping crazy man in The Brotherhood of Satan. His performance was something to remember and to view over and over again. Now I do have to pinpoint him in three of the cult films. He acted in the great film, Slap Stick, alongside Paul Newman. He would play the character Arnold Stoner in the wild and crazy Up in Smoke. My personal favorite besides The Brotherhood of Satan is 1973s SSSSSSS I am such a wonderful sucker for that film.
