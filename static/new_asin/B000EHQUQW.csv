8110068,5,B000EHQUQW,"If you are fascinated by cephalopods, this Nature show is thrilling.  There is nothing that makes me happier than humans caring about animals and sealife of all kinds.  I learned so much about these creatures who have intrigued me all my life.  I wish I were younger so that I might go into oceanography.  The end of this show ""Monsters"" show is wonderful and amazing.",1179187200,,368,4.615384615384615
8110069,5,B000EHQUQW,"""Nature"" is easily one of my all time favorite series on PBS. I especially love it when the show focuses on marine life. ""Ocean Wonders"" contains two of my favorite episodes from the past year (or two), ""Encountering Sea Monsters"" and ""Oceans of the Glass"").

""Encountering Sea Monsters"" is about squids, cuttlefish, and octopi. Camera man Bob Cranston goes on a quest to learn more about these intelligent creatures. One of the most compelling moments in the episode is when he goes into the water with the highly aggressive humboldt squid which has been known to kill and eat people. With a few other scientists (on separate trips), he shows the viewer the mating rituals of cuttlefish, discovers what may be a new species of octopus, and observes the deadly blue ring octopus off the coast of Australia. I was rather disappointed that he makes no mention of the infamous giant squid or the vampire octopus which has been found in the towards the bottom of the ocean. I guess there is only so much one can talk about in a short 45 minute time frame. Overall, ""Encounterting Sea Monsters"" was fascinating.

""Oceans of the Glass"" is about the world re-knowned Monterey Bay Aquarium. The viewer gets a good but brief look at the workings of the fantastic aquarium. They also show the great white shark that was briefly held in captivity so for anyone who missed seeing the shark on exhibit will be able to see it on this dvd. I learned quite a bit how the aquarium functions. The entire aquarium relies on fresh ocean water that comes in through the filtration pipes daily. I also loved the jellyfish segment and how the aquarium breeds jellyfish for their exhibits.

The only scary moment on this dvd is during ""Encountering Sea Monsters"". Bob Cranston goes into the water with the humboldt squid for the first time and almost becomes a quick snack. Overall this is good family fun as well as being educational. Both episodes shows why conservation of the planet's marine life is so important. We can't lose any more of these beautiful creatures.",1148083200,15,2046,4.741573033707865
