903555,4,6304609493,Good off-beat European film with interesting view of Paris. Just a generally different point of view  than American formulaic film-making.

903557,1,6304609493,"This is the lowest quality DVD conversion I have seen to date. The source looks like it must have been an old ex-rental tape, complete with fuzzy 4:3 picture, occasional tracking glitches, and snowed-out frames. The disk is  Region-0 NTSC, but for a world-wide format disk it is surprisingly skimpy  on language options. The only audio track is the dubbed English, and there  are no subtitles in any language. It does contain a scene index, but there  are so few points defined that you may need to revert to the FF/REW buttons  to find the point you're looking for.
 The disk contains a series of  trailers for what seemed to me to be children's films - cartoon features  etc. As this disk is certificate 'R', the choice of these is  bewildering.
 The film itself is still a gem - great characters, good  humour, but it would have been nice to see some of the footage which was  cut for the original release (40 minutes of it from what I've heard). I  don't know if there are any plans for a Director's Cut edition, but I  suspect this is hardly the immortalising version Luc Besson would want.",918604800,,1095,4.520408163265306
903654,1,6304609493,"I purchased Subway because I've become a big Luc Besson fan after watching several of his films: ie. Fifth Element,The Professional, Wasabi,etc.,: all very good films. In addition to the connection to Luc Besson there were a number of favorable reviews posted to this site. After having watched Subway I can't imagine someone giving it a favorable review; and I watched the supposedly ""best version"" of the film. There was no aspect of the film that made it worth spending time watching it. Til you've seen the movie, you're simply choosing which reviews to believe. I'm telling you, if you purchase this you'll regret spending time and money on it. If there were a rating lower than one star, I would have selected that.",1346630400,,721,4.82258064516129
903655,2,6304609493,"Well, the best things that can be said for this film are that it verifies two Hollywood truths:

1. Jean Reno is really cool
2. Isabelle Adjani is really hot

It really doesn't do much else, other than reconfirm that (a) Luc Besson is one of the most overrated directors of all time and (b) Christopher Lambert (still Christophe at this time) can't really act all that well.

The story is mentally challenged.  It grabs elements from a dozen unrelated scripts and tries to glue them together with French mustard.  Naturally, they don't stick together very well.

Adjani is a spoiled and contemptuous wife of a rich jerk.  She and Lambert have at least partly fallen in love, though it is not clear that they've met more than once.  He is also blackmailing her and/or her husband in some manner, with a briefcase full of stuff.  They end up in a Subway for a day or more, with Lambert bouncing around above and below ground, meeting the odd characters of the Subway station.  All the while, they are being pursued by some really stupid transit cops.  It all comes together in some weird Subway concert made possible by the fact that Lambert is some sort of aspiring musician and/or music promoter.  The concert gets combined with gun-toting action.  This description is quite a bit more sensible than the movie itself.

Isabelle Adjani is pretty easy to look at.
Jean Reno can twirl drumsticks.",1337558400,2,1393,4.679012345679013
903656,5,6304609493,"I didn't know what to expect when I watched this excellent Columbia TriStar - Gaumont DVD transfer of ""Subway"", although I knew the movie had been nominated for thirteen Cesar Awards (winning three.)  Mon Dieu! - I was bowled over by the manic energy in its directing, cinematography and editing, the deadpan humor from the wonderful actors portraying numerous eccentric characters and its superb, scintillating soundtrack (how about Rickie Lee Jones singing ""A Lucky Guy"" during one scene?!)  In fact, this genre-bending movie (with a nod to Godard) is mostly about the music (especially in one thread of its various plot lines);  before the film starts, the following quotes appear on the screen:  'To be is to do' - Socrates, 'To do is to be' - Sartre, 'Do be do be do' - Sinatra.

903659,1,6304609493,"First of all, I'd like to say that my review isn't about the movie which, for me,  deserves 5 stars. This is all about the blu ray release.

I can't even figure out why Luc Besson has let it come out this way. Fortunately, we are not morons and thank god we have good eyes to see how bad this release is. So, avoid this one (again!) because it comes from a master DVD which has been awfully upscaled. The picture is pixelized and there are picture noises in its top and bottom. The dark scenes are utterly black and grany. The contrast is as poor as the colors.

Luc ! Where have you been this time ?

903660,5,6304609493,"i see this film as a (romantic) French version of Mad Max :). Or rather, its antipode. It hits all the spots for me - sparse, funny, sad, inspiring, depressing, quirky, unpredictable... a vignette into things, feelings, experiences that really matter. Creativity. Friendship. Eros! Decency! Integrity! which can be found in the most unexpected of places.

Besson showed the world that he can make a phenomenal movie with little money, a lot of imagination and one of the most beautiful women of all time.

The dubbing was awful. And i guess the film, with its accents and slangs is untranslatable anyway.

Yet  - to see a master at work is always a treat.",1291075200,,655,4.769911504424779
903661,1,6304609493,"Because I really enjoyed ""The Professional,"" (It's got some violence so if you can stomach it, SEE THIS great set of performances/action)  by Luc Besson, I thought I'd like all his work.

WRONG!

If you're young and think you'll live forever, go ahead and waste another hour or so of your life with ""Subway.""  No real plot.  No character you care about.  A nightmare of almost absolutely nothing interesting happening.

I can't write more.  I'm getting upset again thinking about it.

Besson does have a more interesting/not great film called, ""Angela O.""

Some also liked a futuristic, sci-fi of his starring Bruce Willis (can't remember the title....... it's late......... but I wasn't crazy about it.

Luc!  Get it together man!",1239408000,,731,5.0
903662,5,6304609493,"I was lucky enough to see this film theatrically when it came out in 1985. It definitely loses it's artistic impact on the small screen, but it's something that constantly keeps your eyes engaged. Almost every promo shot for this film had Christopher Lambert holding that portable light fixture -- in fact the theatre I went to see it at ran an ad along the lines of ""Christopher Lambert is a light sabre-toting cat burgler"". In actuality, he has it in his hand for about thirty seconds, before he lets it slip as he loses his footing on a catwalk. Shades of the BLADE RUNNER promo sheet of Harrison Ford running across the top of a car. Was that shot even in the film? Still, that image of Lambert (like the rest of the film's visual palette) is pretty cool. Stay away from the cheaper copies -- the quality is worse then a VHS dub. The Bassist (also doing double duty as film composer) is Eric Serra, who recently composed the score for BULLETPROOF MONK. Lots to look at, and some great music to boot. Well worth the purchase.",1142899200,3,1028,4.444444444444445
903663,3,6304609493,"SUBWAY is a very interesting movie. It's more of a movie that is focused on the characters, rather than the plot itself. Definitely buy the enhanced version (the one with Lambert holding the neon light). The dubs aren't that great, but at least Lambert dubbed himself. I suggest watching it with the subtitles first. Being a Lambert fan, I figured I'd check out the film in which he won best actor in France's Caesar Awards. It's a very interesting movie, I more appreciated it, but it was entertaining nonetheless. Worth the buy if you're a Lambert or Besson fan.",1141862400,3,564,4.707070707070707
903707,4,6304609493,"As a gift to myself I purchased the Luc Besson Collection. Two-thirds of the movies I was familiar with. This was one I was not. But what have I got to lose? I mean, let's evaluate what it had going for it before even watching it, alright? It was a Luc Besson film, ok, points earned there. Jean Reno (from Leon, the Professional) was in it, obvious trademark, but something I always enjoy. And hey, look at this, Christopher Lambert (from Highlander) was in it, kudos!

Quickly, in order to become genuinely immersed in this film, I'd like you to consider two methods of watching it. I recommend watching it in French with the English subtitles. I think you get a much better feel for the personality of the film this way. Watching it English dubbed (with English subtitles) you find that some of the language is not translated correctly. For example, Fred speaks about being a six year old in a car accident, but the English subtitles say five. Sure, it is only a small difference, but it is not the only one - in this sense, the movie is consistently inconsistent. Watch it in French, it's much better that way.

I think movies which spotlight small and strange sub-sub-cultures are utterly fascinating to me. Here we are thrown into an underground life, where strangers protect and help one another in a moment, knowing that one always needs allies in a world always out to get you.

While I can see how some might be shocked and confused by the events and the relationships between the characters - I think it is all true-to-life - in the sense that people are unpredictable, with history and complexities that can not be fully addressed or understood in the hour-and-a-half given, nor should they be.

So I enjoyed this European story telling, even if it was trapped by the 80s influence of bad clothing and hair style choices. It adds to the quirky charm.",1130025600,2,1862,4.599397590361446
903708,3,6304609493,"I looked into the film Subway (1985) because I was interested in other work done by Luc Besson, director of such films like La Femme Nikita (1990) and Lon: The Professional (1994).  Now I realized from the outset this film was going to be more of an avant-garde affair based on the reviews (many tout style over substance), but what I didn't realize was just how boring and pointless it was going to be...the film stars Christopher Lambert (Greystoke: The Legend of Tarzan, Lord of the Apes, Highlander), whose in the process of making yet another Highlander film titled Highlander: The Source (2005)...talk about milking something for all its worth...along with Isabelle Adjani (The Tenant, Ishtar).  Also appearing is Richard Bohringer (The Cook the Thief His Wife & Her Lover), Michel Galabru (La Cage aux folles), Jean-Hugues Anglade (Taking Lives), and Jean Reno (Mission: Impossible, Ronin).

The film begins with a pretty exciting car chase as a character we later come to know as Fred (Lambert), decked out in white, spikey hair and a tuxedo, speeds away from a group of men intent on getting his attention by playing a high-speed game of bumper tag.  The chase ends near a subway, to which Fred utilizes to escape from his pursuers, making his way into the dark labyrinth of steel and concrete.  Apparently Fred (described as a `hipster' thief on the DVD case) had been attending a party, one host by a millionaire and his beautiful wife named Helena (Adjani), stole some important documents, and is now holding them for ransom.  Problem is, Fred finds himself falling for Helena, which only serves to complicate matters.  These scenes are mixed in with various scenes of all the different and interesting folk Fred meets underneath the subway (sadly, there are no mole men), many of which have absolutely nothing to do with the story whatsoever but help fill out an hour and forty minute running time.  So what does Fred intend to do with this money once he gets it?  How about starting a band with the various underground (literally) musicians he's since met while hiding out from the cops and hired thugs?

First of all, one should be wary as there are numerous DVD releases of this film, some much worse than others, and Amazon has mixed the reviews for these various releases together in a cross-linkage nightmare (good job guys).  The one I watched, and am now reviewing is the Columbia/Tristar Studios DVD (ASIN: B00005OSJO) release with Lambert holding a neon light and features blue graphics on the cover (it also appears to be the more expensive version).  The version to avoid is the one with the two shot of Adjani and Lambert where it appears Lambert is sliding his hand into Adjani's shirt.  Getting back to the film itself...as I mentioned before, many reviewers have commented on element of style over substance with regards to this film, but I felt it had little of either, which brings up another question...are all French directors required to produce one ` New Wave' film during their career?  I've got nothing against New Wave cinema as I enjoy films like Alphaville (1965) and Repo Man (1984), but the aspects consistent with that style of film didn't really come through here for me.  That's not to say they wouldn't for someone else, though, as it comes down to ones own interpretation...the movie just seemed plodding and pointless with little symbolistic and/or abstract conceptual present, two of the elements supposedly prevalent over the more traditional aspects like plot, defined characters, narrative i.e. an actual story.  Also, what little there appears to be of the former seems to be what it is only on a very superficial level...I know there's no formula for determining this kind of thing, but if you're going to go this route, then jump in with both feet and give the audience something to chew on...that' just my opinion...really well done avant-garde works one different levels in that, on the surface it can entertain, while also maintaining a depth for those whose wish to explore further and develop their own ideas with regards to underlying themes and their significance.  I will say even though there was a prevalent sense of boredom throughout for me, the film did look good as Besson, if nothing else, knows how to set up a shot.  Another positive aspect about the film is the music, much of it composed by Eric Serra, who actually appears in the film as Enrico, the bassist.  Serra has since gone on to score any number of films including La Femme Nikita (1990), GoldenEye (1995), and Rollerball (2002).  I did think the idea of people living and existing beneath the subway an interesting idea, but not completely original as I've seen it before in the 1972 film Death Line aka Raw Meat, although that was a story about cannibals living beneath the London subway, surviving off the occasional passenger snatched from the platform.  One thing I did learn from this film is the subways in Paris are reasonably clean and remarkably free of vermin like rats and roaches, something generally prevalent in the belly of metropolitan mass-transit beasts.

The widescreen anamorphic (2.35:1) picture on this DVD look decent, but isn't without some very minor flaws, ones most viewers will be able to live with in slight age defects.  The Dolby 2.0 audio comes through cleanly enough.  It's odd as the DVD seems to be set to play the English dub along with the English subtitles, but this can be changed.  I would recommend the original French track with English subtitles (the English dubbing is pretty lousy).  There are a couple of extras in the way of filmographies for some of the cast and crew, along with trailers for Lon: The Professional (1994), The Messenger: The Story of Joan of Arc (1999), and The Big Blue (1988).  No trailer for this film, though...

903711,2,6304609493,"I now wonder why I purchased this flick, a definitely shadowy tale about the romance and adventures of a petty criminal who only gets meaner as the film goes on, and the spoiled young wife of a middle aged businessman. There really is no one to root for in this film, not Christopher Lambert, whose Fred is a raunchy-looking, sociopathic hothead who loves to pull guns on people the first chance he gets, or any of the other characters, most of them living, (LIVING!) in the bowels of the Paris Metro, (which looks an AWFUL lot like Anysubway, Anywhere!) There's ""The Roller"", a purse-snatcher on roller skates; a black muscleman who suffers insults to his intelligence begrudgingly; the cold and terse Helena, played by Isabel Adjani, who ALSO seems fond of pulling guns on people; numerous inept cops named after American pop culture icons, (""Batman and Robin"", ""Tom & Jerry"", etc.,) the police chief that seems a WEE bit too fond of coffee and a smarmy flower peddler who looks like he walked right out of a Martin Scorcese movie. NONE of these people could be even remotely called ""loveable"", their behavior makes that impossible. The criminals are a little TOO vicious, especially for petty ones, and the police are buffoons.

Fred manages to get and retain the attention of Helena by extorting her with some papers he had palmed from her personal home safe. She eventually meets him and pretty much gets sucked into the world of the oddballs living in the tunnels, walkways and hidden compartments of the subway herself. This all leads up to a finale: a concert to be put on by the more musically adept among the denizens where tragedy finally strikes after an hour and a half of mischief and police ineptitude.

I wouldn't recommend ANY teenager see this movie because of the gawd-awful influence it may exert on them, but for somebody studying criminology, it may be entertaining...

There is ONE scene with Adjani and her character's husband at a swanky soire? at an associate's home, where Helena, (Adjani,) smarts off to a fare-thee-well. It's probably the best scene in the film. And the sound production is pretty good too, as it was in its initial VHS version 16 years ago.

903713,4,6304609493,"You're seeing reviews for all releases of SUBWAY, which makes identifying which DVD to buy a bit difficult. The better DVD, with the original French Dolby 2.0 soundtrack, was released by Columbia/TriStar, has a cover showing the leads costumed as punks with Lambert bleached blond, and sports a heftier price tag. Beware the bargain-basement pricing -- the loss of quality with the cheaper disc is equivalent to the difference between Hi-Fi and LP prerecorded VHS tapes.
With the higher price you get options. The Columbia/TriStar DVD is presented in the original 2.35:1 aspect ratio, anamorphically enhanced widescreen, and also offers the dubbed English soundtrack as well as subtitles in English, French, and Spanish. Trailers and scene selections fill out the features offered.
The dubbed English soundtrack isn't so bad, for what it is. The translation doesn't jibe with the English subtitles (""You ruffle me""?), but Lambert, at least, dubbed himself. The dubbing for Jean Reno is a hoot and an unexpected bonus.
SUBWAY garnered 13 nominations in the 1986 Cesar Awards, France's answer to the Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and five acting noms. The film took home three awards, including a Best Actor nod for Christophe Lambert.
SUBWAY is an early and significant entry in Luc Besson's portfolio, and that of several of its actors, most notably Jean Reno and Isabelle Adjani (who has earned 11 Best Actress awards to date). The film has one of the best openings ever -- sharp, frenetic, and a foreshadowing of RONIN's wondrous car chases. From there the story gets...strange, but that's expected of any sudden entry into a vastly differing society. Helena (Adjani), hair spiked stiff, tells off her gangster-husband and their so-polite dinner companions in one priceless scene, then flees in favor of the more companionable denizens found in the subway. SUBWAY leaves you scratching your head, wondering what's the point, where's the point, and knowing it's just there if you could only see it, lurking at the peripheral vision. Not a bad thing and, sure, not for everyone, but the trip into the Paris Metro is interesting and fun, nonetheless. Composer Eric Serra gets some screen time (Bassist), and watch for director Besson driving the train.

This version has the full widescreen treatment, the original french language w/ english subtitles (plus the terrible dubbed version, if you are so inclined).  In other words - the way it was meant to be!
The quality is fine.  It's not perfect - but quite good.  I hear the other one looks like a used VHS tape.  Sound and video are both nice.
As for the film itself - I saw this movie originally in the theatres back in the eighties during high school.  Young, yes - impressionable, yes - but it introduced me to Luc Besson, who at the time was doing original and engaging work. (La Femme Nikita is still his best.)  I have been waiting, since then for a suitable version to come out for purchace.  This is it.
I love this movie!  A lot of people really overthink this movie.  They say things like, ""All those people don't really live down in the Metro!""  Duh.  They say things like, ""The plot is stupid, and the characters are fake."" or ""It's all style and no substance.""  True, it's not Citizen Kane.  But it is a simple, if slightly unbelievable, love story with quirky and engaging characters, a lot of style, originality, and panache.
The chemistry between Fred (Christopher Lambert) and Helena (Isabelle Adjani looking her best ever, and that's saying a lot) as the starcrossed lovers is believable and endearing.  The style is always engaging:  From the opening chase where Fred cannot really drive his car effectively until he finds the appropriate music, to the final kiss.
This is a romance surrounded by an interesting, if unlikely, subculture setting a criminal and the bored wife of a rich politically connected busisman in an arena where their occupations and pretence are reduced to be only the reason for their introduction.  From there, they both fight against the constraints of the real world to let their love bloom.

It's all over the place. The story (or lack of) is totally unengaging since you never really understand what's going on. I like movies that keep you guessing, but the only thing this movie had me guessing was ""when are the credits gonna roll.""
If you're a fan, this is probably the best you'll ever see it. I checked out the English Dub of the movie and was surprised that Chris Lambert actually did his own lines English as well as French...a nice touch. Still there's really not much here (in the way of extra's or otherwise) to warrant a purchase.
If you want to see Luc Besson at his best, save your money and get Le Femme Nikita, Leon: The Professional, or The Fifth Element!!! All are great movies, although Leon: The Professional gets the most love as far as DVD treatment goes (nice extras, great deleted footage that's actually part of the movie!!!), the other two are bare bones DVD's (but still great movies).

903791,5,6304609493,"Go for the new DVD from Columbia Tristar and you'll finally get this film the way it was meant to be seen--in anamorphic widescreen and in French with English subs (there's also a dubbed English track if you have to listen to it that way).
The video and audio quality is fantastic.  It's a fun film with a great looking Christopher Lambert and Isabelle Adjani heating up the screen.  Makes a good double feature with ""Diva"".",1005350400,3,424,4.565789473684211
903792,5,6304609493,"This film is very enigmatic.  Unlike Besson's later films, it relies less on atmoshpere and cinematic appeal, and focuses solely on the characters.  Despite the fact that this film obviously had a low budget and was fairly primitive in its production values, the power of the acting and the story is more than enough to carry you through.
Of course Luc Besson would not make a movie that was not purely based on the theme of love--philanthropic love--and this is no exception.  The entire film is a sermon on the values of acceptance and tolerance; however, it avoids taking that subject to the extremes of sexual liberation, et cetera.  It puts an emphasis on socio-economic diversity and on personality conflicts.
Although intrinsically '80s and difficult to take seriously with all the cultural change of the past twenty years, the film's message is more necessary today than when it was made.",1001808000,2,896,4.953333333333333
903793,4,6304609493,"To any Luc Besson fan out there, I thought Subway would never be released on DVD in it's proper widescreen image.  But anyone who follows his work knows that lately many of his films have seen the special treatment : Director's Cut of The Big Blue, Internation Version of Leon aka The Professional, and The Fifth Element is being released in a Superbit version (with no extras, sadly).
Subway is one of my favorite Besson films.  It's a film either greatly loved or greatly despised.  From the opening scene of Christopher Lambert cursing and swearing because he can't get the tape deck in his car to work, you're swept away into an underworld filled with many bizarre characters.  The opening car chase is quite fun as the music propells the chase while seeing Lambert with a huge smile on his face...that is until the tape deck breaks again and he decides to seek refuge in the Subway, running into those bizarre characters I mentioned on the way.  And any Luc Besson film that includes Jean Reno in it is extra special.  Here he plays ""Sticks"", a drummer.  Not as noticeable a part as his later roles like in La Femme Nikita, but still noteworthy.  And Christoper Lambert looks completely zany (in a good way) with that blonde hair.  Only regret about Isabelle Adjani's performance is that the woman who dubbed her doesn't do her enough justice.  Thank goodness Christopher dubbed himself in English.
I'm not certain if this DVD will include anything other than a token trailer, but I don't care at this point.  Just to have a cleaned up, crisp widescreen picture in Dolby Surround is enough to make me happy.  Oh, and if you're lucky enough to happen upon a copy of the Subway soundtrack on CD like I was, grab it and never look back.  It's gottan extremely rare since it went out of print many years ago.  Composer Eric Serra has done pretty much all the scores for every Luc Besson picture and this one, in my opinion, is one of his best because it not only heightens those exciting moments as well as the sad ones in the film, it actually helps create the atmosphere of the films surroundings that gives it an extra added dimension.
So, if you're into Luc Besson or Christopher Lambert, I highly suggest you pick this up.  The price is not too bad, which is always important.  Enjoy!",1001462400,2,2290,4.575980392156863
903794,5,6304609493,"This is a movie without MUCH plot but a lot of style and some substance.  Only see this movie in French AND don't rent the dubbed version from Blockbusters--the dubbed version is garbage so remember to see it in French.
Isabelle Adjani, French's premier actress (""Story of Adele H""; ""The Tenant""; ""Nosferatu"", ""One Dangerous Summer""; ""Queen Margot""; ""Ishtar (in English); ""Diabolique"" (in English)) and Christopher Lambert (""Highlander"" series) are two star crossed lovers who end up in the Paris Metro system with a group of vagabonds, tramps and pickpockets.  Lambert wants to put together a rock band even for ""just one performance"" and the breathtakingly beautiful Adjani has just run away from her bourgeoise life up top, a life replete with a fat rich husband, jewelry, all the designer clothes she can wear and servants.  She threw a fit in the middle of one of her husband's dinners, told everybody to ""F-off"" and ran away to the undergrounds, the ""subway"" presumably to find what really matters.
There is a scene in the movie where Lambert is holding a baby picture of Adjani as she really was as a child.  He had stolen the picture along with her (Helena) character's jewelry as Lambert is a thief.  Well, he stole more than her jewelry and picture as you will see: he stole a bit of her heart and soul and gave back some sweetness and tenderness.
The soundtrack is haunting and beautiful as a bonus, including the song ""It's Only Mystery.""

He is on the run  from some corporate characters and meets the beautiful Isabelle Adjani. It  is not nearly as good as Leon, but does have some style. The DVD is  atrocious though. The picture has got to be the worst one ever. The  transfer looks like it was taken from an old video tape with the tracking  out, it really has to be seen to be believed. Also, there are no chapter  times. The sound is not much better too, and is very loud, probably because  it is encoded in MPEG 2 compression. There are no extras as well.

903860,1,6304609493,"Despite truly wanting to experience this movie again and see Besson's early work in the context of his newer films, The Professional and Fifth Element, the greedy way this DVD presents this film angers and saddens me.  Only the video distributor/publisher benefits from this lazy transfer to  DVD, as they lure unsuspecting film lovers into purchasing this release.  Watching this film in its current condition felt as if you had opened a  leather-bound copy of a classic novel and found the distilled text of a  Readers' Digest version inside.
The DVD arrives with only a single  English audio track and no subtitles. The laughable English dub makes  watching the film almost unbearable; the remixed music pales next to the  original exciting soundtrack.
This is a slick, entertaining film with a  fabulous cast of familiar Besson regulars: Jean Reno, as an annoying  drummer; Eric Serra (Besson's music composer); a very 80's styled Isabelle  Adjani; and Jean-Hugues Anglade as a roller skater--a far cry from his  deadpan role as Zorg in Betty Blue (372 le matin).
