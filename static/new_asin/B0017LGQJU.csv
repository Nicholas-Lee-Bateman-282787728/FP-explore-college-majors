3173512,5,B0017LGQJU,"If you see or follow a lot of animated series then you'll quickly start seeing certain patterns appear. One of those is when the authors are (seemingly) totally out of good ideas and try to setup a new environment in which they can re-use a lot of their already used storyline(s). And what better way to do that than to focus on another period of the main characters. And this phenomenon is what has given us  cartoons like ""New Archies"" (one of the first to my knowledge), ""Scooby Doo kids"", ""Flintstone kids"", and so on.

And now there is a new kid on the block, but fortunately for us one with a very big ""BUT.."" (no fun intended here ;-)). Personally I think that in most cases the idea to (re)do the series with the main characters in their teens is a very good way to kill the entire series. Sometimes it doesn't add up.

BUT...  Not so with Aika R16. This 3 episode series shows us Aika in her teen years, she's just turned 16. But instead of all the series I described earlier this one doesn't try to do things over. Instead we get to see Aika as she just got her C-class Salvager card which allows her to operate certain salvaging equipment used for deep-sea diving and to retrieve artifacts. And now that she's an official C-class salvager its time to try and find a job to actually get to do some salvaging.

Aika is still at school (living on the dormitory) but isn't taking it very seriously so it seems. It is here when she suddenly discovers that some of her classmates are interested in salvaging too and they want her to operate their submarine. This is a opportunity for Aika which she finds very hard to refuse. Especially since its some state of the art equipment she's allowed to operate...  So instead of doing things over this story actually is a very well done addition to the previous Aika series.

Thats as far as the storyline goes (without any spoilers). If you haven't seen any Aika episode before then be warned.. Aika wouldn't be Aika without a big dose of so-called ""fan service"". Which boils down (among other things) to panty shots, more panty shots and even some topless scenes. Did I already mention panty shots? I can't  stress that sillyness out enough. You either like it or you don't, it really is plain out silly but not in an annoying manner.

Being an Aika fan myself is already enough to rate this DVD high. But what really made me go from 4 to 5 stars is that this isn't some annoying ""remastered"" release. Which means that the colors on this DVD aren't as bright or saturated as you would get with ""remastered and enhanced"" DVDs without giving you the impression that the colors are flat and dull. ""Flat and dull"" are quite fine for older series in my opinion because that was the best they could. Now things are different and this is clearly displayed in this release. Good sharp and clear colors without getting annoyingly sharp or saturated. (note: a personal opinion of course, I've seen many ""remastered"" anime series and so far disliked all of them. eventually I went for the originals again instead).

A big thumbs up from me. Personally I really hope that there will be a volume 2!",1212796800,18,3135,4.493848857644991
3173513,5,B0017LGQJU,"It has been quite a few years since the original Agent Aika was released, but we finally have new episodes for this series. As the original Aika suggests, this is a fan service show. There is never a missed opportunity to show off a girl's underwear in this show, or for a blatant nude scene. If this offends you, then you may want to skip this title, just like Ikki Tousen or Queen's Blade.

In this series, Aika is a 16 year old high school girl, and is reeled in on an adventure with a very rich classmate, and her friends. One of her friends has a butterfly tattoo that actually has information on a treasure in the ocean, when the tattoo is scrutinized by a computer. The girls realize that some of their friends have been hypnotized and try to attack Aika. There are also other mysteries behind this, and why their friend had the tattoo in the first place, and also where it is actually leading them to.

The animation for this Aika release is very good. It looks a lot better than the original, but that should be a given since this is nearly 10 years later. Notably almost all the girls in this series are high school age, but in the original, they all seemed to be adults. They seem to employ the standard moe-esque appearance in this anime, rather than the first series. This is also a very colorful series too. Many shows look very dark in appearance, and in nature, too, but this show employs a lot of color. Mostly the color comes from all the hair colors and swimsuits. Yes, there is a beach episode featuring all the girls in this series.

Overall, this is a pretty fun series, but it is very brief at 3 episodes. There isn't much of a conclusion to it either because I would of liked to know the reasoning of certain events in this series, but it is never revealed. Note that this series takes place before the original, so that means Aika does not transform, which is kind of a letdown, but there is enough in this series to enjoy.",1381622400,,1948,4.346153846153846
3173514,4,B0017LGQJU,"If you liked Aika in the first series, or just like girls, action and fan service, this is for you, and I like all these.

3173515,5,B0017LGQJU,A nice addition to Agent Aika. This is a short OVA series about how Agent Aika became who she is later on in the original series. Fan service around the clock but very easy on the eyes.,1366761600,,185,4.027027027027027
3173516,4,B0017LGQJU,"Aika R-16 Virgin Mission, its for the ecchi/fan service kind of crowd, story so-so it just a way to get young aika in bikinis and fighting scenes. it is not for somebody looking for a deep story.",1365811200,,195,4.297297297297297

3173518,4,B0017LGQJU,"Aika has just gotten her class c salvagers license at 16 years old. She is invited by the school treasure hunting club to pilot a submarine on an adventure. Karen, one of the clubs members has a butterfly tattoo on one of her breasts. It is actually a treasure map. The club president, Eri, is determined to find what lies at the bottom of the Ocean. They go through a lot to get there, and when they do, they discover a shocking secret about Karen's past.

R-16 is better than the original Aika in every way. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all a step up. There are more panties than ever, and tons of topless teenage chicks. Despite the obvious focus on nudity, it actually has a fun, intersesting, and light hearted story. It is a 3 episode OVA and it runs about 75 minutes. I think that if you liked the original series, you'll most certainly like this one. Maybe even more.  I thought the original series ran out of gas after episode 4. This one doesn't have time to drag on for an hour. It's a lot of fun with tons of eye candy.",1357257600,,1050,4.297979797979798

Topless teenagers in a storyline that might have been seriously done otherwise but that doesn't appear to be the point here; this is just an excuse to draw pictures of topless teenagers, period.

8266465,3,B0017LGQJU,"There are a number of good reasons to make a prequel; unfortunately, the creators of this one didn't bother to apply any of them here.  According to an interview in the Extras section, the creators simply felt that something should be done to mark the tenth anniversary of the original release of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Agent-Aika-Anime-Legends/dp/B00114UUMW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Agent Aika: Anime Legends</a>&nbsp;and figured that doing a story set ten years before the setting of the original was a good way to do it,... and it shows.

A prequel can be a nice way to provide an origin story for your heroine, but that is not actually done here.  We see a 16-year-old  Aika Sumeragi beginning to work with a 41-year-old Gozo Aida, but we are never told why.  (It is hinted that Gozo might have raised her following the death of her parents, but that's about it.)  Nor is there any sign of, much less any explanation for the sentient bustier that transforms her into an unstoppable warrior in the stories set 10 years later.  It can also be fun to meet other characters earlier in their histories but except for Gozo the only other returning character we meet is a 14-year-old Gusto Turbulence, and his character is even more annoying at this age.

A problem with prequels is the introduction of new characters who of necessity do not appear in the original.  Eri Shinkai and Karen Minamino play huge parts in this and the following Aika Zero OVA series but for some reason that will eventually have to be dealt with are not present in Agent Aika.

Prequel plots can be equally problematic, and this one was a mixed bag.  On the one hand unlike the fairly conventional James Bond plots of Agent Aika, this plot was unusual and clever.  Unfortunately, it was also never resolved!  A great mystery was uncovered... and just left unexplained.  Nor was it explained or even mentioned in Aika Zero, which has its own unresolved plot issues.  Both OVA series seem intended to set up a longer Aika story that never got made.

Finally there are some things that it is ""OK"" to do to adult characters that get downright creepy when done to 16-year-olds.

If you love Agent Aika, you will want to watch this; otherwise, it will be confusing and of little interest outside of the fan service.",1465257600,,2338,4.923469387755102
