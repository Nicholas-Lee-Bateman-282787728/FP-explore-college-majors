7846267,5,6303403417,"I have been recently re-obsessed with the stunning beauty of Ms. International Chrysis, having seen ""Q&A"" a few months ago and decided to Google her and discovered this DVD/Movie. I did not know she has passed away when Q&A was released and it made me sad. It made me want to know more about her. Well, I simply cannot keep my eyes off her!! She has that star power and thing that whether you are interested in the ""lifestyle"" or not, you simply can't keep your eyes off her inner and outer beauty and, in my opinion, a certain kindness she possessed that I am drawn to. The Documentary was made on a very low budget but, in my opinion, was well made and does what it sets out to do, show us how fabulous she is and was and that she was very loved, worshiped, admired, and respected. I feel a very special parallel connection to International Chrysis and I highly recommend this movie to anyone who knew this Legendary person or anyone who is looking to discover one, even though she is not here on Earth, her spirit is and will live on.

7846268,5,6303403417,"I've read the other reviews and am actually shocked at how short sighted those who stated they knew her/ him were and what the film is actually about. Chrysis was clearly complicated, and compartmentalized many people and many parts of her/ his life as do all ""personalities"" often do and I'm sure the film makers had tremendous difficulties because of that being the case. Oh, and like most of the downtown crowd thats been in and out of recovery tell the truth?? C'mon... Here's what's interesting - the film is a non- Hollywood produced and directed independent film, was shot in 1992 when there was little, if any coverage, on LGBT, and shows the pain and tragedy of a soul struggling for peace. For that alone I commend the filmmakers. Secondly, it was self funded. It turns out Ellen Turk was friends with William/ Chrysis and paid for the film out of her pocket because she wanted to help tell such a painful story with such a super large spirit. Great story....the message... think...think...think...",1433289600,,1008,4.7988505747126435
7846269,3,6303403417,"I agree with the comments of user 'A Loving Spirit..."" though my perspective comes from another angle: I was not Chrysis' lover, but more like her kid -- one of many 'younguns' she 'adopted' actually, and without whom I would have wound up truly homeless and dead. Two of the individuals interviewed -- Ann and Bobby -- I met once or twice, and each,more or less, make accurate statements. But the gentlemen with shaved head, who I do not know (no surprise since I was not exposed to Chrysis' entire world, so to speak) presents as facts notions about her sexuality that are at odds with what I knew of her from staying with her in the mid '80s. Sexually, she could be many things, not just a dominating top, and she did see herself very much as a gay man -- which was always apparent via her witty humor and wisecracking but tender advice to me. In order to understand that, you simply must be a gay man. She was so damn funny and so intuitive about life and people. Also, I'd like to point out that she was born in Brooklyn, winding up in the Bronx when her father moved her family there, to the Grand Concourse. And, as a child, she was known as Billy, never Willy, least of all, 'Willy from the Bronx.' And in any case, she was Chrysis from an early age and that was that. I will never, ever be able to erase from my mind her manner of speaking -- the way her lips pressed against her teeth. She modeled her look in many ways on that of Margeaux Hemingway, who we both felt was gorgeous. Oh how we poured over the pages of ''Cosmopolita!' The film was completed after Chrysis passed on, and the filmmaker, eager to capitalize on the success of Jenny Livingston's 'Paris is Burning,' rushed the film to the can with uncredited interviews (any good film director caption-credits those interviewed, to contextualize relationships)... Chrysis talked about making a film of her life for several years, and by the time filming began, I had moved on to a real job and the beginnings of a real life, thanks to Chrysis and some other motherly queens. But the majority of the film is comprised of anecdotes from friends of her 'Hot Peaches' days, with very little 'Chrysis' to be found. For instance, little is referenced of her life in the '80s -- work with musicians, time in L.A. (I was there for that), film work, etc. Just pathetic. Like commenter 'A Loving Spirit,' I found the film unworthy of 'documentary' status, but enjoy seeing Chrysis in every frame that she appears since I am remain indebted to her and iss her terribly.",1392595200,2,2529,4.476190476190476
