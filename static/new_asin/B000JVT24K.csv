8153385,3,B000JVT24K,"This falls into the ""better than nothing"" category and should rightly be five bucks or less.  The transfer is really low quality: low resolution, flickering, and dim.  I actually think the copy I downloaded from youtube is superior.  This is the second Asterix DVD I've purchased and they've both been sub-par in terms of video quality.  I would really love to see the Asterix catalog get a proper DVD treatment, but until that happens I guess I'll make do with these half-baked offerings.",1461024000,,489,4.855421686746988
