2824544,5,B000PKG6P8,"Having seen twice the play Les Miserables and Liam Neeson's Jean Valjean, Bernard's work is the definitive. It captures Victor Hugo's book extremely well! I hate to say this but one should read the book, all 1,456 pages, first to gain a true appreciation of the greatest literary work in history!",1226188800,2,296,4.823529411764706
2824545,5,B000PKG6P8,"I absolutely love this movie. I bought it for my retirement gift and on my first day started watching it. I have been disappointed in the past from previous versions of this great story. Even though this was very long I never became bored. I have not watched the second movie (Wooden Crosses) yet. This movie follows the book to a ""T"". I highly recommend it.
Update: I have watched Wooden Crosses and it is a very good movie. Very depressing yet engrossing. More of an anti-war movie but excellent. Also...I have recently watched the musical version of Les Miserables. I wasn't impressed. Probably the only one who wasn't. I liked the songs and the scene with Sacha Cohen Baron in it - very comical. The scenery was great but couldn't handle the constant singing plus the story is really disjointed.",1221782400,3,799,4.673758865248227

2824547,4,B000PKG6P8,"A huge hit in its native France in 1932, Raymond Bernard's film of Roland Dorgelese's autobiographical novel Les Croix de Bois aka Wooden Crosses hasn't dated as well as some of its contemporaries like All Quiet On the Western Front, The Big Parade or Wings, although there's still much in this tale of the gradual decimation of a group of French soldiers in the First World War that works extremely well. It benefits from being made within living memory of the events and by people who were actually there (the entire cast, including Charles Vanel, Antonin Artaud and Raymond Cordy, served in the War), and there's often a feeling of stark veracity to some of the imagery, such as an ignored soldier crawling on his back through No Man's Land after an attack. There's also a determination to at least to try to avoid some of the clich&eacute;s already inherent in the war movie thanks to several years of propaganda films - one soldier dies cursing his unfaithful wife, another tries desperately to stay awake as he waits for the medics to find him among the dozens of wounded, while in the film's most moving scene a mass gives way to the moans of the wounded in the makeshift chapel hospital while one soldier offers a cynical but heartfelt prayer for life or at least hope from the sidelines. Throughout, hope, pity and salvation remain denied as the war goes on and on.

Bernard's direction is years ahead of his time, the very camera going mad in one huge battle scene where the men are killed defending a cemetery, the handheld camera at times even having to dive for cover and seek shelter from the all-consuming chaos. Yet as a feature it's not entirely effective because few of the figures these events happen to are particularly vividly characterized or portrayed: many of them blur into each other leaving too few characters to care about. It's a fine film and a genuinely noble one that didn't deserve the fate that overtook it - rather than getting a US release it was instead used for stock footage for films like Cavalcade and the remake of Seventh Heaven while in Europe post-WW2 it became increasingly obscure as new horrors robbed it of some of its relevance - and one that's certainly worth a look in Eclipse's nicely restored DVD.

Nearly seven decades before Peter Jackson got New Line to make three Lord of the Rings films back-to-back, the success of Les Croix de Bois enabled Raymond Bernard to persuade Pathe to back an epic three-part version of Les Miserables in 1934, each part released in remarkably quick succession (quite literally a week apart in France). No expense was spared - Arthur Honegger was hired to score the film and the cinematographer of Abel Gance's Napoleon, Jules Kruger, to photograph it on lavishly realised sets filled at times with thousands of extras. Running more than five hours in its original version (and not far off it in its restored version on DVD from Eclipse), it has much more room to breathe than any of the Hollywood versions, and as a result, rather than concentrating on pitiless policeman Javert's relentless pursuit of the reformed convict Jean Valjean, comes closer than any other version to capturing the sprawling narrative and the well-realized supporting characters in Victor Hugo's panoramic novel of rehabilitation and redemption in a cruel world.

In the imposing figure of Harry-Baur (himself tortured and murdered by the Nazis nine years later) it has a Valjean you can believe has spent most of his life in prison while in Charles Vanel's relentless Javert a man as rigid and unimaginative as his greatcoat, while Bernard frequently offers literally askew visuals of a world off-balance that sometimes make The Ipcress File look defiantly horizontal as well as the odd moment of handheld fury to compare to the best scenes in Croix. Yet still the first film, Une Tempte Sous un Crne/Tempest in a Skull, never quite succeeds in grabbing the heart as well as it does in telling the story. Things pick in the second part, Les Th&eacute;nardier as the loathsome low-lives assume a more prominent role, with the film offering a particularly chilling ending as Valjean is faced with both a reminder of his past and a possible warning of his future, only for the characters to occasionally get lost in the spectacular events of the 1832 Students' Revolt that dominates the third part, Libert&eacute;, Libert&eacute; Ch&eacute;rie. Throughout it's constantly engrossing, but while it's a good yarn, it doesn't quite move as you think it could, more a solid literary adaptation rather than a moving emotional experience, though it's not for want of trying and it's certainly worth seeing.

Again the film was ill-served by time, much re-edited (initially as a single film) and only restored to something like its original length in 1977 shortly before Bernard's death. Amazingly this three-part version on the same DVD as Les Croix de Bois is so beautifully restored aside from a few scenes that you'd have a hard time believing it was ever lost. And keep an eye out for one scene of outrageous overacting in Part Two from Jean Servais listening to the Th&eacute;nardiers plotting through the wall: you can actually hear Bernard directing him off-camera (""Vite"")!",1194307200,29,5236,4.886389201349831
2824548,5,B000PKG6P8,Both films are great.  Everyone should thank Criterion for putting these two lost treasures of French cinema on DVD.,1189728000,4,116,5.105263157894737
2824549,4,B000PKG6P8,"It's hard to capture the solemn grandeur of a Victor Hugo narrative in a film. What get's left behind will feel like a soap opera (Fantine's story), or a fairytale (little Cosette's story), or Disney scene (Cosette going to the well at night). Here, the students on the barricades seemed nothing more than callow, reckless youths -- but maybe that's what Hugo had in mind.

I have no problem recommending this film, however. Not once during this film's 5 hour length did I get bored. While I would wonder if this scene or that came from the novel, the famous scenes are there, lovingly detailed.

Acting by French actors unfamiliar to me was generally good, sometimes  colorful and memorable. Massive Harry Baur nicely embodied the powerful, world-weary Jean Valjean and he also doubled wonderfully as the pitiful Champmathieu, the defendant at the trial. (This actor would die during WWII, apparently the victim of Nazi torture.)

The most stunning element of this movie for me was the vivid B&W cinematography by Jules Kruger. The production values were excellent, showing their limitations only during the battle of the barricades. While the director Raymond Bernard had a tendency to overuse the tilted camera he otherwise did a commendable job in what is obviously a heartfelt production.",1189555200,8,1293,5.056338028169014
2824550,5,B000PKG6P8,"As of this writing I have seen six different film versions of Victor Hugo's classic novel.  Not until viewing Raymond Bernard's version had I felt like I had seen the definitive filming of LES MISERABLES.

Don't let the year it was made (1934) scare you away.  Yes - filmmaking had only been around for a few years and you may think that the later versions would be more technically advanced and capable of re-creating the novel in a more fully realized fashion.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  After viewing the 1934 version, I question why anyone chose to remake the film to begin with?

From the opening shot of the contorted, gnarled, grimacing figure carved into stone being held up by a similar human figure literally carrying the weight of the world on his shoulders to the final shot of the two candlesticks slowly extinguishing simultaneously with Jean Valjean's last breath.  The candlesticks representing so many aspects of Jean Valjean's life - oppression, thievery, poverty, wealth, light and finally death.  Jules Kruger's brilliant cinematography utilizes not only the German expressionistic style that was popular then (shadows, light, angles, etc...), but the occasional handheld camera work was years ahead of it's time.

What I was most impressed with, along with the cinematography, was the caliber of acting from the lead players.  When viewing films of that era it seems that much melodrama goes into the performances.  But from the first moment you witness the subtlety, sincerity and honesty of Harry Baur's performance as Jean Valjean, you are mesmerized.  He encompassed all that made Jean Valjean such a noble, dignified, compassionate and tragic figure in the novel.  I will always picture Jean Valjean as portrayed by the brilliant Harry Baur.  All the other performers totally give of themselves to make the characters come to life. They bring you along with them on their journey.  You truly experience their pains and joys and at each tragic turn you feel like you have lost a true friend.

I was entertained and transported for nearly 5 hours.  The quality of the film, the storytelling, the acting and the care that went into this production stayed with me long after the candles burned out.  I hope you too, will discover this long, lost treasure of foreign cinema.",1185926400,41,2311,4.989556135770235
2824551,5,B000PKG6P8,"Of all the versions of les Miserables that I've seen (and I've seen a few of them), this is by far and away the best and also closest to the spirit of the book. The whole film is imbued with an atmosphere which transports you to a different time and place. The story absorbs you, the characters come alive. The composition of the images often gives the impression that they have been carefully sketched out, in the manner of Eisenstein or Bergman - only they have a simplicity that does not intimidate. The telling of the story, the acting, the scenery makes it an immortal film - it still makes you weep and it does not resort to Holywood's tricks to do so. For me it is amongst the top ten films ever made.",1179705600,59,708,4.291044776119403

2824604,5,B000PKG6P8,"I had never heard of the French director Raymond Bernard until I watched the ""Les Miserables"" marathon shown on Turner Classic Movies (TCM) on December 13, 2012.  After listening to TCM host and film historian Robert Osborne's introduction in which he praised the film and its director, I decided to watch an hour of the 4 hour and 45 minute film just to see if it was worth a look.  It was and then some!

I was hooked after the first hour and sat enthralled as I watched the film in its entirety.  I would categorize this underexposed movie as a masterpiece.  And thanks to TCM and Robert Osborne, many more people know about it now.

Bernard's ""Les Miserables"" looks modern in every respect.  The cinematography and editing are fluid yet striking.  The camera angles are often unexpected and askew giving more punch to the narrative. The performances are subtle and naturalistic, no over-the-top histrionics.  And Bernard's command of action sequences is as impressive as his ability to coordinate a cast of thousands in a logical procession.

Seemingly no expense was spared in this production.  The richness and authenticity of the sets, costumes, music, etc. just add to the film's magnificence and power.  You do not want to miss a single minute of this remarkable movie.  You will be totally transported into another place and time.  And you will be thankful for the experience of this stunning realization of Victor Hugo's compassionate masterwork ""Les Miserables"".",1355443200,3,1474,4.963265306122449

The easiest way to explain how great this movie is is to say I started at 11pm thinking I'd fall to sleep shorty after. No way! I was so enthralled by the movie I wouldn't dare fall asleep!

2824606,5,B000PKG6P8,"2 French films from he 1930s by the wonderfully talented Raymond Bernard.

1932's ""Wooden Crosses"" is the less celebrated of the two, but I found it the more powerful.

It's a terrific dark anti-war WWI film, light years ahead of it's time stylistically, with battle scenes
that rival (and clearly inspired) Kubrick's great 'Paths of Glory'.

More cynical, cutting, and real than 'All Quiet on the Western Front'. The film focuses on the various
members of a battalion who are basically canon fodder. There's no real lead, just an observation of
these slowly hardening men, as a group, and no real plot, just a series of episodes.

Not every episode is as strong as the other, but enough are so powerful they make this a special and
important film, amazingly directed for its time.

The 1934 epic adaptation of ""Les Miserables"" is the better known film, but, for me the more mixed
bag.

The first part of this three part, four hour and 21 minute adaptation is superb and moving.  For its time
the characters are surprisingly nuanced in both writing and acting, and there are a number a great scenes
and terrific twists.  Sadly, and frustratingly the 2nd and 3rd parts (presented by Criterion as 3 separate
films on 2 discs) feel much more hackneyed and clichd, with much more uneven acting, thinner characters,
and overly melodramatic moments.

Lead actor Harry Baur is great throughout, which helps keep the 2nd and 3rd parts still quite watchable,
and throughout there is some terrific camerawork, including modern-feeling touches like hand-held fights,
and Dutch angled scenes.  Certainly this is a brave work on a film-making level.

But as the story focuses less and less on Jean Valjean and his various incarnations, and more and more on the
world around him, that thrilling feeling of watching a masterpiece faded into just watching a very interesting
and impressive piece of film history.

That said, so many film writers I respect treat the whole thing as a masterwork, so I'll re-visit it some day.

The Criterion restorations are quite nice, given the age of the films and the elements available, and
this package is very worth while  (and reasonably priced)  for anyone with interest in cutting edge
film-making in the 1930s.",1341100800,5,2237,4.912234042553192
2824607,5,B000PKG6P8,"The Eclipse Series 4: Raymond Bernard is a wonderful collection of two of his most famous films. Wooden Crosses, the first movie in the collection is France's answer to ""All Quiet on the Western Front"", and follows a French regiment during World War 1. This movie is good, to say the most, but nothing to really write home about, but of course I could be biased. For the real reason I purchased this was to obtain the 5 hour version of Les Miserables. Too long have I seen the classic, yet epic and tragic, tale of Les Miserables butchered to shreds by films that only spent 2 and a half hours on it, if that. This version, directed with care by Raymond Bernard, who obviously shared a great love for the story himself, chose the right actors, the right scenery, and pretty much the right EVERYTHING. This movie is a mammoth of a film, yet I watched it in only two sittings, and did not get bored with it once. A terrific film for anyone who truly loves the story of Les Miserables!",1338163200,3,982,4.371584699453552
2824608,5,B000PKG6P8,"Easily the best version of Les Miserables put to film in my opinion. The DVD quality is exceptionally good for the film's vintage, which means there is no barrier to a modern viewer's full enjoyment of a cinema masterpiece. Bernard and his cast demonstrate a commitment to Victor Hugo's themes and a faith in story-telling that make other filmed versions of the novel seem watered down and fake by comparison. It is long, but the power is magnified, not diminished, by virtue of that. It is another proof of how far the art of cinema came by the 1930s and how far, in most cases, it has fallen short since.",1282694400,2,606,4.5181818181818185
2824609,4,B000PKG6P8,"Few actors were as good as Charles Laughton and so any time I watch a film that was also made with Laughton, I am tempted to compare the films. It's not a fair thing to do but I do it anyway. Most times, the other version of the film fails to live up to the one Laughton appeared in, partly due to the fact that Laughton was in it. For me, he was the definitive Henry VIII (1932), the only Captain Bligh (1935) worth remembering, the true Rembrandt (1936), the most gruesome Quasimodo (1939), etc. So, watching Les Miserables, I am tempted once more to compare Laughton's Inspector Javert (1934) and again, the portly wonder wins out.

So putting this aside, one can look at the merits of this version. Like most french films it is far too long (5+ hours), and the scenes seem to go on far beyond their required time, but I understand that this is a cultural thing, and many people will find this attractive. I find it boring, but I'm prepared to admit that my own predilictions come to play.

That being said, there can be no question that this is one of the few films that looks as if it was actually made by the author. I felt as if we were really transported back to France in  the early 1800s, and I was peeking in on the activities from which the great Victor Hugo took his novel. It's not only the sparse settings and the lack of a musical score, but the costumes and the makeup all seem to suggest we are watching a documentary.

Credit the look and feel of the film to director/producer Raymond Bernard who made 30+ films between 1917 and 1958. Heavily school in the silent film era, many of the scenes in Les Miserables have that same sense of drama and captivating use of the camera to study the person's face. This was one of two films he made under Pathe-Natan prior to their demise in 1936. His career was put on hold when the Nazi invaded France, since Bernard was a Jew. Immediately after the war he made ""Um ami viendra ce soir"" that spoke to the Nazi era.

Harry Baur plays Jean Valjean. Bauer was a veteran of nearly 100 films, starting in the silent era in 1909. In addition to his portrayal in this film, he is best known for playing Beethoven in the greal Abel Gance's 1937 film.

If you have the time, this is certainly an interesting film to watch.",1278979200,4,2272,4.309133489461359

2824611,4,B000PKG6P8,"My introduction to ""Les Miserables"" was in the form of a Classics Comic book when I was a kid.  Naturally, the comic book did not cover the full scope of the novel.  I later had the pleasure to watch a couple cinematic versions of the story including the Frederic March version from the 1930's.  It covered pretty much the same ground that the comic book did.  Last week I watched Raymond Bernard's French version of the French book and I saw a lot of the story that I had never seen before.  I anticipated as much since this version was nearly 5 hours long.

What I assume I saw was a lot more of what I suspect Victor Hugo wanted to convey.  The book is quite long and I never made a serious effort to read it although I may some day.  I understood what the title of the movie meant and, I confess, I didn't really catch how story I read and watched lived up to the title.  I now know more of what Hugo probably meant for us to understand.  I believe that the book was intended to show the victims of (French) society.  Whether the characters in the story were saints or scoundrels, their fate had been predetermined and they were stuck with it.  This film version allowed me to understand Hugo's purpose as the familiar scenes blossomed into a story of epic scope.  What was new all seemed to be about want, suffering and the desperation of hungry people.  That hunger took many forms from lack of food to lack of love to lack of proper representation.  In the midst of all this is a true hero, Jean Valjean whose is lacking the sense of security due to his youthful stealing of a loaf of bread.  The persistence of Javert the policeman/detective in the pursuit of Valjean is the core of the story that we are accostomed to in the numerous abrdged versions.  It is the tale of the hunted fugitive and the abridged version in every form I've seen makes it very interesting but, based on what I saw in Bernard's version, the full story is more impressive.

I guess I should rate this movie with 5 Stars instead of the 4 I gave it.  The direction is excellent, the acting good to excellent, the script, well, that speaks for itself.  I guess there are times when the movie doesn't sequence well and times when the power of its' story is put into simplistic scenes.  Five Stars or Four Stars, this is an excellent movie.  Watch it if you've got the time.",1257033600,3,2353,4.336384439359268
8192083,5,B000PKG6P8,"I really enjoyed seeing this version of Les Miserables, because it goes into greater depth in several places. For instance, we actually get to see the trial of the man mistakenly arrested by Javert as being Valjean. We hear testimony from his ""prison mates"" attesting to his identity, and we hear his unconvincing attempt to say that he is someone else.

I also appreciate that this is not one film that is 4 hours and 40 minutes long. Rather, it is three shorter films, the longest of which is about 1 hour and 50 minutes. This makes it easier to watch such a long film.",1494547200,,571,4.438095238095238

8192085,5,B000PKG6P8,"This is a review for the LES MISERABLES movie by Raymond Bernard. To cut to the chase, if you are a fan of LES MIS then you simply must see this version - as I said in the title of this review, it is a MASTERPIECE for its time (1934) or any other. To me it is the definitive version of the book because of all the movies I have seen it is the closest - by that I mean the following...
1) this movie holds true to the spirit of the book and doesn't change V Hugo's intentions (for example later films have Valjean and Fantine as love interest (wrong), or that Valjean was in love with Cosette other than as a father figure (wrong), or they omit the Thenardiers (wrong), etc, etc). This film holds true to the story

2) this movie includes so much of the book that is missing in other versions. In here you'll find tons of little scenes which are well done, such as...
  a) an extended scene with Valjean, the bishop, his sister, and M Magliore....Valjean's theft of the little savoryard
  b) The downfall and sickness of Fantine (even her missing front teeth are included which is oft overlooked)
  c)  The Thenardiers haggling over Cosette, their acting as the poor Jondrettes and their plot with the gang of ruffians, even something as small as their picture of Waterloo in included. (Although I do lament that Thenardier in the sewer was mysteriously absent and we didn't see them again after their arrest in the Jondrette affair)
  d) You'll see Cosette and Marius in the garden and at the Luxemborg - 2 things you usually don't get.
  e) Gavroche is included as is his due and even if death is depicted accurately with his singing taunts of the army as he searches the dead for ammo. In addition, EPONINE is spot on -- her assistance to Marius, her love for Marius, her part in Jondrette affair, etc are all there. AND her death scene is tragic enough to bring a tear to your eye (if only Marius's actor could have stepped up in that scene too!)
  f) M Gillenormand (Marius' Grandfather) is absolutely awesome! He steals every scene he is in and he's in more in this movie than any other I've seen. Just fabulous!
  g) You see the students plotting in a hidden room of the ABC Cafe...General Lamarq's funeral march and the resulting riot are also included....the governments plans for dealing with the riots (of which Enjolras and Marius's is only 1 of many)
  h) The scenes at the barricade are amazing. Nearly everything you want is included - the old man's bravery in planting the flag atop the barricade, building the barricades, 3 rounds of fighting, front and rear barricades, gavroche going for more ammo, Javert's capture, etc, etc Of course Eponine's heroism in saving Marius and also Valjean's feats - including letting go of Javert and saving Marius
  i) A great job in the sewers - I kept thinking surely they will tone it down but believe me they did not - Valjean and Marius were IN the sewers up to their faces and it was about as lifelike as you can get - yuck! (Again my only complaint was Thenardier's absence)
  j) Cosette and Marius's wedding is well done
 k) Valjean's confession to Marius and Cosette although slightly different than in the book was still well done and his death scene was another heartfelt moment.
 x) Other tidbits that come to mind: Valjean saving Fauchelevent under the cart, Valjean's race to the court at Arras to save Champmatheiu, the whole court scene was fantastic and so true to the book, and so much more
 z) WHAT's MISSING: obviously no movie is going to include everything, here's what I found missing: not much about Valjean in prison, no backstory of Bishop, very little of Fantine's quartet and her romance with Tholomys, Fantine's meeting with Thenardier's to give them Cosette, nothing of Valjean and Cosette in Convent, and probably more but all in all this movie had more little tidbits than any other I've seen so far. It should be noted that in this edition there is a nice insert that tells the story of this version and all that the director had to go through to get it released - remember this came out BEFORE WWII and that had a big part in it being lost to history for while. The story goes that even this version at 5 hours is not the complete version because some of the film has been lost forever - that said, what's here is great.

3) The acting was right on for me. I understand that nowadays some may think there was a bit of overacting (mainly among the actress who played Fantine) but it didn't bother me. I must say that Harry Baur played a simply perfect Valjean (exactly as I pictured him from the book) -- AND he even played Champmatheiu at court to a tee. I say again you will not find a better Valjean than Baur - period. As for Javert, he was right on from beginning to end -- Duty was his driver (as it should be, not love of power or brutality as in later versions). The Thenardier's also played a good part and as I said above M Gillenormand was absolutely brilliant. I also appreciated the students and their desire for revolution - it was really well done

4) What else do you need to know? it is in Black and White. The dialogue is in FRENCH with english subtitles. There are 2 discs and 3 movies that make up the story - 281 minutes.  It's long but honestly it flies by. I don't know that you can find this 'new' simply because it's so old - mine was used but it was in perfect condition. It is a film I will treasure - I hope you can find it too.

Here's the bottom line - as I said in the beginning, if you are a fan of Les Mis - especially if you have read the book and are aching to see the book on film in a version that does honor by respecting the book and including so much of it then do yourself a favor and BUY THIS ASAP.",1412640000,5,5724,4.353383458646617

it's also one of the best movies ever made. Period. The five-hour length allowed
the moviemakers to go deeply into Victor Hugo's master novel, creating not a
souvenir of it but a rival in art. The cast, the script, the continuity--even the
odd camera angles--all contribute to a remarkable presentation. Hugo's book is
incredibly rich, and so is this film. The battle scenes are extremely well
done, and on the gruesome side (at one point, a woman stabs a soldier's poor
horse), and the lovably lawless street urchin Gavroche is on hand, full of
charm as in all the versions. (This one makes it clear that he is one of the
Thenardiers, an odd fact often left out of Les Mis adaptations.) When the
fighting gets intense and Gavroche is told to hide somewhere, he defiantly
cries, ""You can't overthrow the government without me!"" Those who find the musical
version confusing (and there are many such) should screen this one, because, in it,
everything is made clear.",1376524800,5,1043,4.736263736263736
8192089,3,B000PKG6P8,"When I last ordered this, the first DVD split from the middle to about 1/4 of the way through, just from taking it out of the box. This is a great series, and I would hate to see it ruined by sub-standard production. If the next one splits the same way, I will have something to say about it. I have had nothing negative to say about the Criterion Collection, but I have never seen a DVD split the way this one has. I hope I receive a better produced item. Thank you.",1369440000,,467,4.032258064516129
8192090,3,B000PKG6P8,"I had high hopes for this, given the many good reviews here. I'm a big fan of Les Mis&eacute;rables, the novel being one of my favorites. (I'm not a fan of the musical, though I've seen the recent film adaptation of it.) I was especially interested in the length of this version, which makes it the second-longest I've seen. (The longest is a recent French mini-series with G&eacute;rard Depardieu.)

Alas, I only watched part of it, because the acting is just not very good. It looks as though some of the scenes were the only takes available, and in some cases, the actors seem to not know what to do. Granted, this is a movie from the 1930s, but still...",1367280000,,657,4.475
