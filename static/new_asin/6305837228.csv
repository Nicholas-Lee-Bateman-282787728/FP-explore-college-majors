7896151,5,6305837228,"Even though a lot of people hated it, I loved the all new Popeye-hour and this DVD was sold to me for a very reasonable price and it even runs on my European DVD player. Thanks a lot!",1429833600,2,183,3.8421052631578947
7896152,5,6305837228,"THIS DVD CONTAINS POPEYE CARTOONS FROM THE LATE 70'S/EARLY EIGHTIES HANNA BARBERA POPEYE CARTOON SERIES!

SURE, IT'S NOT THE ORIGINAL POPEYE OF THE 1930'S, BUT POPEYE HAD BEEN RELEASED IN A NUMBER OF FORMATS OVER THE YEARS!

THESE CARTOONS ARE ACTUALLY THE ONES I GREW UP WATCHING ON TELEVISION!

THEY REALLY ARE QUITE ENTERTAINING!!",1173830400,2,333,5.12962962962963
7896153,5,6305837228,"I grew up in the 80's.  This was the Popeye that I first met and loved.  These aren't ""bad"" at all.  They're a bit different than the older stuff, yes.  I enjoy both now, but it took me a while to get used to the older ones, since this is what I grew up with.

For you twenty- and thirty-somethings out there that grew up watching this show, this is great.  It's just as I remember.  I still enjoy watching this today.",1118966400,2,418,4.024390243902439
7896154,1,6305837228,"Totally useless.  The worst Popeye cartoons ever made.  They are Hanna-Barbara, but now where near the quality of their better stuff.  Actually not as good as their worst stuff.",1081296000,,177,5.0344827586206895
7896155,4,6305837228,"This is a batch of Popeye TV-cartoons from Hanna Barbera's ""All New Popeye Hour"".  They could no longer feature Popeye and Bluto slugging it out.  Despite that, the animation is fine and the scripts are entertaining.  It's true, they're not the ol' Popeye that most people remember (and want to see on home video) but they are entertaining.",992908800,10,340,4.827586206896552
7896156,2,6305837228,"I bought this thinking of the old great cartoons of my childhood, but alas  these are later ones.
I suggest the ""70 Years of Popeye"" for  the real deal!",966297600,17,152,4.206896551724138
