2897433,5,B000TGJ86M,I knew I could count on Amazon to have what I needed to fulfill my Grandson's Christmas wishes.,1200009600,,95,4.333333333333333
2897434,5,B000TGJ86M,"This 80's cartoon is good clean entertainment.  There is always a lesson to be learned.  I use to watch this show when I was a kid and now my kids are watching it.  They walk around the house singing...""We are the Littles..."" and looking in vents for signs of them. Ha-ha, that is the most entertaining part.",1198108800,6,308,4.368421052631579
2897435,4,B000TGJ86M,"In the endless mucking about through hundreds of cutesy kids shows a few do come out on top as being innovative, educational, and above all entertaining. The Littles was one of those kinds of shows. While the episodes had a moral to them that moral tends to be shown in a more practical way than your standard ""always brush your teeth after each meal... and knowing is half the battle"" kind of prachy message. In other words it entertains. As a youngin' myself I found this show wasn't condescending to little kids while at the same time engaging them.

The Littles is based on a widely popular book series and is about a family of little people (very, very little people... think Tom Thumb little) going about their daily adventures in a world of giants (that would mean us regular folk). The animation is surprisingly good with some nice art and nice frame rate compared to other Saturday morning cartoons. Considering this is a show for kids between around 8 and 13 it does get goofy and you do get those silly sound effects every time somebody (or rather Dinky) falls over and the like. Part of the fun is seeing how they use our common small household items as creative inventions for their own environment. That includes anything from basic tools and furniture to airplanes and other vehicles. The cast is a good blend of characters and include:

Tom Little - A 13 yr old with an adventurous streak to him.

Lucy Little - The ten year old sister to Tom who tends to be the sensible one.

Dinky Little - A 21 year old little who pilots the airplane and tends to be the clumsy Gilligan of the group.

Grandpa Little - The brave and somewhat wise one of the bunch that, with the help of Dinky, keeps the kids from getting in over their heads.

William and Lucy Little - They are Tom and Lucy's parents and don't really adventure much, but they are there for the kids.

Henry Bigg - If you haven't guessed by his name this is the normal sized boy that befriends the littles and helps them along.

With this DVD set you get the entire series of half hour 28 episodes (well less than a half hour if you count commercials). Not only do you get all of the episodes but you also get the Weekend Special Feature ""Liberty and the Littles"", which is a made for TV special that's over an hour long. Unlike many cartoon DVDs (or television DVDs for that matter) you also get a host of extras as well. Here is the breakdown:

- Featurette "" Little Ideas for Big People""
- Interview with show writer Marc Scott Zicree
- Storyboard comparisons
- A little snippet on the history of the DIC logo (the show's production company)
- A host of printable material including series bible, episode storyboards and episode outines.

If you have kids in this age range that have any imaginative flair to them and you want them to learn some good moral and practical lessons without being preached to them this would be a good set for them. Obviously since the show is from the 80's it won't have the kind of ""newness"" you would get from more recent shows, but at the same time these characters are timeless and the show tends to follow that trend.",1196640000,33,3125,4.4475524475524475

2897485,3,B000TGJ86M,"I bought this for my 6 year old, as he's been reading the books in the series. For the most part, it's fine, and he just loves it. I was, though, kind of taken aback by an episode focused on a mother's abuse of pills, and her daughter feeling lost, alone, and considering taking pills herself. This wasn't just a side story, it was the main focus of one of the episodes! (The Littles' objective in this episode is to stop the girl from starting to take the pills herself - during which one of the characters is exposed to the drugs and has a ""drug nightmare""). This may or may not be a problem for other parents, but it was for us.

I haven't watched all of the episodes, but if you like to monitor what your kids watch, or you have young kids, as with anything, you may want to watch this with your kids, or before your kids, when you get it!",1404259200,5,843,4.109090909090909

2897500,5,B000TGJ86M,"Cute cartoon show based on the books by John Peterson.  Like Arriety in ""The Borrowers"" and the crew and passengers of the downed space flight ""Spindrift"" in ""Land of the Giants"", the little people here are the underdogs to root for.

The Littles family and assorted relatives and friends with their tails and toothy overbites encountered big adventures in trying to survive in their oversized environment.  Luckily, the Littles have a giant friend in normal-sized Henry Bigg to protect them from sinister scientist Dr. Hunter and his assistant Peterson and hostile giant animals.  ""Green Acres"" fans will recognize the voice of Alvy Moore (Hank Kimball) as Grandpa Little and ""Rainbow Brite"" and ""Get Along Gang"" fans will recognize the voice of Bettina Bush (Rainbow Brite/Dotty Dog) as Lucy Little.",1388966400,,801,5.186046511627907

2897536,5,B000TGJ86M,"I have very fond memories of The Littles television show based on John Peterson's beloved children books, and I was excited to watch the complete collection from Mill Creek Entertainment. All 29 episodes are on three DVDs. Honestly, I thought the series had more episodes. The show first aired in 1983 and lasted for three short seasons. In 1985, the Littles hit the big screen (but only showed in matinees) in the prequel Here Come the Littles. In 1986, they returned for the final outing in the made-for-television movie Liberty & the Littles.

The Littles are only a few inches tall and have a mouse like ears and a tails. The main Littles were Tom and Lucy (brother and sister), their cousin Dinky, and Grandpa Little. Occasionally their parents appeared in a few episodes. They all live in the Bigg house, where a young boy, Henry Bigg, is the only one that knows of the existence.

Of course, every cartoon needs a villain, and in the Littles, it is a crazy doctor who wants to prove that the Littles are real. With the help of Henry, the Littles always managed to out wit the mad doctor.

  The Littles has a clever and catchy theme song during the opening credits. The opening changes every season. During the first two seasons, at the ending of the episode there was a short segment where the Littles teach how to make a small toy out of everyday household items, but for them these items for tools or vehicles. During the third and final season, the segment switched into a history segment.

I was two years old when The Littles aired, so I only recall bits and pieces of the series. It was shock watching the third season as the show premise changed. The Bigg family is traveling around the world and Littles go with them. Cousin Ashley Little is the new addition to the series. I was never aware that there were two movies until I bought the DVD.  Here Come the Littles told the story of how Henry learned of their existence. Henry goes to live with is cruel uncle after is parents go missing. Tom and Lucy accidentally fall into Henry's bag. Dinky and Grandpa Little learn of their disappearance and go out to rescue them. The movie was a flop and panned by critics during its original release in 1985. The move slightly takes a darker tone while continuing the humor of the series. I thoroughly enjoyed it, which I cannot say the same for the made-for-television movie. Liberty & the Littles ditches Henry Bigg, and involves the Littles traveling to New York for a 4th of July vacation. Dinky crashes their plane near the Statue of Liberty where they meet a village of other Littles. Sadly, this was the last of The Littles! I wish they had a better exit, but I am more than happy that they are on DVD and I can relive some of my childhood.",1337731200,,2754,4.507014028056112
2897537,4,B000TGJ86M,"I adored this cartoon as a child and look forward to watching it again as an adult.  Call me crazy, but certain things in life will always bring a smile to my face regardless of time passed.",1333238400,9,190,4.135135135135135
2897538,5,B000TGJ86M,"I've always liked the Littles animated series (I've usually been a sucker for early DiC Entertainment shows, ""Heathcliff and the Catillac Cats"" and ""Inspector Gadget"" come to mind!) so of course I just HAD to get this DVD. By this point, the show wasn't being rerun anymore anywhere, and the old Yahooligans TV website was long gone (they showed the Littles, along with many other classic and contemporary DiC cartoons), so this DVD set was pretty much the way to go. This is surprisingly thorough and filled with some cool special features! I'm also glad it's unedited, as the syndicated reruns from 2004 to 2007 had hacked and time-compressed all the episodes (the show was last seen in my area on my local CW network, which showed the DiC syndication package from 2006-2007.)
The animation is very high-quality in many of the first and second-season episodes, all of which were outsourced to TMS Entertainment in Japan (they also animated Heathcliff's first season as well), and many of them have interesting plots, ranging from basic life lessons like jealousy (""Twins"") and superstition (""The Littles' Halloween""), to more hard-core stuff like drug abuse (""Prescription for Disaster""), alcoholism (""A Little Drunk"" - my personal favorite episode) and being handicapped (""The Little Girl Who Could."")
The episodes themselves are all uncut and complete, and on a few of them you may even see some old ABC Littles bumpers (""ABC now returns to the Littles!""), but many others seem to be taken directly from the same prints used on the old Yahooligans TV website (they were also uncut there). I also liked the storyboards, and the montage of various ""Little Ideas for Big People"" segments (sure beats having to fast-forward episodes just to see those), and the original 1980s series bible. I also liked seeing the 1986 TV movie ""Liberty and the Littles"" (aired as part of the show's third season.) The ""Visual History of the DiC Logo"" was sort of unneeded, as it only featured the Littles' custom DiC logo (which was cut from syndie reruns), the 1980s Vortex logo from the ""Liberty and the Littles"" movie, a 1990s Kid in Bed DiC logo (with Telecinco byline), the 2001 extended ""Incredible World of DiC"" logo and the cool 2002 DiC ""Feature Presentation"" bumper from certain DiC video releases. DiC had more logo variants than that, actually (even ""Inspector Gadget"" had its own, which was cut from DVD releases.)
Similar to my Inspector Gadget DVD reviews, here are my factors for it...

PROS
All episodes are included and uncut
Many of the special features are excellent
The inclusion of the ""Liberty and the Littles"" TV movie

CONS
Some episodes do have a bit of noticeable DVNR on them at times
The episode ""The Rats are Coming"" has the audio a bit out of sync with the video
There are also a few occasional film/video artifacts in ""Prescription for Disaster""

Other than those, this is highly recommended to any Littles/DiC/80s ABC Saturday Morning Cartoon fan like me!",1332720000,4,2972,4.92814371257485

2897541,1,B000TGJ86M,"Thank god its less than 6 bucks.

It comes in what looks like a standard double dvd case (before they came up with all these slim cases). So you would assume that disc 1 would be either on the cover or on an internal divider with disc 2 and the last disk on the back of the case... WRONG, WRONG, WRONG. all three discs come in paper sleeves with plastic windows and are held in place by plastic tongs on the back wall. So in order to pull a disc out you must pull the paper sleeve out of its holding clips and slide the disc out. Lets hope you don't lose the paper sleeve or lets hope the repeated removal and replacement of the disc in the case doesn't tear or damage the sleeve to the point where it cannot be held in place any longer.

1 star for the packaging and 1 star for the littles.

As to the quality of the video... Leaves much to be desired. It looks like they made a direct transfer from film to dvd... so 25+ yrs of dust, hair, and other debris can be seen during the presentation. There is no effort put into trying to clean up the film.

27"" CRT TV = Looks grainy but you can't see the dust and hairs as much.

46"" HDTV (BD Player - up-scaling) = Every line looks jagged and fuzzy. Ever try to create a diagonal line in paint? yeah looks like that.  As you get involved with the show the dust and hairs become less noticeable.",1324598400,10,1342,4.0452830188679245

2897545,5,B000TGJ86M,"Now that the previous set is out of print this is your chance to once again get "" The Littles "" original series from D.I.C. now known as Cookie Jar Ent. You get all 29 episodes and also 2 bonus movies. The previous set had only one movie "" Liberty and the Littles "" which was part of the ABC Weekend Specials series. "" Here come the Littles "" the other movie included here is like a prequel to the animated series which you had to buy on a separate dvd release to have previously. Getting the whole series and two movies for this price is bang for the buck!

This is a quality cartoon; funny, adventurous, educational and all around fun for all ages. If you need to know more the previous set reviews go into great detail so it's no need to repeat it again here. Mill Creek is a budget company thus the price for this set is very nice! Mill Creek has done mostly a good job with all their other animated releases and this one should is no different. For the price you are getting a great collection which 80s fans and kids today can enjoy!

I have to say if you are a collector the previous set was much better for extras as this set only comes with a trailer for another Mill Creek release. But you could consider the addition of the "" Here come the Littles "" movie as an extra since the last box set did not have it. The other set is out of print, it's still for sale on Amazon through sellers so my point was to say you probably couldn't find the original set in stores any longer. The last set had 5 single discs, this set has 3 discs so there is tighter compression going on here but the picture is still quite nice for the age of the show. If you're a casual fan of the show or someone who doesn't want to spend the extra to buy the original release I still think this a good purchase.",1306886400,24,1791,4.0852272727272725

If you enjoyed watching the Littles as a child you will love it for your own children, the quality is great considering it's from 1983; I love the old feel to it...I recommend it for everyone",1287446400,,373,7.288888888888889
2897558,5,B000TGJ86M,"I remembered this cartoon coming on, but usually I would be so sleepy or too busy to enjoy it. After all of these years, it feels great to have the complete series. I am a full grown man, but I feel like a child again watching this cartoon. This was a great buy at a gereat price.",1284249600,,280,3.9298245614035086
2897559,5,B000TGJ86M,"I was a child of the 80s, the era of wonderful children's programming (nothing like the drivel passing off as children's entertainment these days, well, except for some quality PBS shows). Anyway, when I found this series available on DVD, I quickly ordered a set as I enjoyed it as a child and wanted to share it with my 5-year-old. ""The Littles"" centers around 10 inches tall siblings Tom and Lucy, cousin Dinky, Grandpa Little and parents, Frank and Helen. Their human friend is 12-year-old Henry Bigg and his pet turtle, Slick. There's also a villain in the form of Dr. Hunter. For the most part, the show is well-written, with positive messages imbued in each episode.

Here's a breakdown of the episodes:
Season One
Beware of Hunter!
Lost City of the Littles
The Big Scare
Lights, Camera, Littles!
The Spirits of the Night
The Little Winner
A Big Cure for a Little Illness
The Rats Are Coming, The Rats Are Coming
The Little Fairy Tale
Prescription for Disaster
The Little Scouts
A Little Gold, A Lot of Trouble
Dinky's Doomsday Pizza

Season Two
Looking For Grandma Little
Every Little Vote Counts
The Forest Littles
The Littles' Halloween
The Little Babysitters
A Little Rock and Roll
The Little Amazon Queen
The Little Girl Who Could

Season Three
Deadly Jewels
The Wrong Stuff
When Irish Eyes Are Smiling
Ben Dinky
For the Birds
The Twins
Tut the Second
Just a Little Drunk

Season Three marks a departure in the Littles' storyline as they embark on international adventures - to India, outer space(!), Ireland, Rome, and Egypt. There are some bonus features included such as:
Disc One
""Storyboard to Episode Comparison"" featurette
Disc Two
""How Would the Littles Use?"" Trivia Game
Disc Three
Compilation of ""Little Ideas for Big People"" shorts - provides tips on how to make Littles' like objects using items found in the home.
Interview with Marc Scott Zicree
Disc Four
""Liberty and the Littles"" - an hour-long movie on Disc 4. This is indeed a bonus - the story centers around the Littles finding a whole colony of Littles (French ones at that) living within the Statue of Liberty (how fun!).
""Show Bumpers""
Disc Five
Brief collage of animated DIC logos (nothing much here)

All in all - this DVD set contain 29 episodes of The Littles on 5 discs. The quality is not crystal clear, it shows its age and I wish more effort had been taken in restoring the picture quality. The aspect ratio is 1.33:1. Another thing to note: In order to truly have the complete set, one would have to order ""Here Come the Littles"" which is sold as a separate movie, but other than that - this is worth the purchase for those keen to walk down memory lane, experience a sense of nostalgia, and share a wonderful children's series with their own kids.",1269129600,3,2742,4.6923076923076925

2897564,5,B000TGJ86M,The Littles Compete series was a ABC series based on the children books. Some of the episodes include the original ABC commercial bumpers and all the episodes include LITTLE IDEAS FOR BIG PEOPLE where kids are show how to make the type of stuff The Littles characters use in that episode.  The DVDs are separate containers instead the box so one doesn't have to worry much about the disks getting loose or scratched during shipping like sometimes happen with the fold out series boxes.  Dinky Little is the one who personality changes most between books and show as he is used for comic relief in the TV series with the way he always messes up and get in trouble.  The set also include all three versions of the opening theme.,1230422400,12,726,4.569230769230769
2897565,5,B000TGJ86M,"I am extremely pleased with this set. I had never heard of ""The Littles"" before I came across it as I was searching for something for my almost 8 year old daughter. I took a chance and hit the jackpot! She loves it! I gave it to her on a long vacation trip and it kept her busy so I didn't have to hear ""Are we there yet?"" The packaging is quality and I like the fact that it is a ""teaching"" cartoon and not just a silly time killer. She is still watching it now that we are back from vacation. She likes shows such as ""Alvin & The Chipmunks"", ""Josie & The Pussycats"", ""The Flintstones"" and ""The Jetsons"". If your child likes these kinds of cartoons, then you really should give this one a chance!",1217203200,,697,4.094890510948905
