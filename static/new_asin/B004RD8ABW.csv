""Use a thorn to remove a thorn"" - Greg Goode has meticulously deconstructed all that is inferential, that is, everything other than direct experience. He uses constructs (plus, crucially, your own direct observations) to show that all your constructs are just constructs, leaving the ineffable reality of experience as the sole candidate for who you are and what the 'world' is. Then... carry on making use of constructs! Instead of them making use of you.",1476748800,2,565,5.01063829787234
8438985,5,B004RD8ABW,Greg is awesome!!! I really recommend this set to all truth seekers.,1461196800,,68,4.75
8438986,5,B004RD8ABW,"This is a wonderful entryway into Advaita. Greg Goode and Chris Hebard team up to produce a classic which gives us all the building blocks needed for relating to the subject. Greg Goode brings clarity to the discussion. He illustrates ""difficult to understand"" concepts with simple exercises. Chris Hebard puts himself in our shoes as he leads the discussion to towards a logical conclusion. The entire discussion is of a three hour duration. As a serious student of Non Duality, you would not find a single moment that is wasted.
This work is a gem among the modern works on Advaita and will make an excellent companion to other works on The Direct Path by Greg Goode.",1450915200,2,669,4.726495726495727

8438988,5,B004RD8ABW,"After working a while with Greg Goode's book (Direct Path) I heard of these dvd's.  They are extraordinary.  Greg Goode has done a masterful job of extracting the guts from Sri Atmananda's teaching and making it something we can work with experientially to realize everything is an ""arising"" in awareness (in nothing) and then beyond that.  I am fortunate to have come across this work and wish to thank Greg Ascue for mentioning it to me.  Chris Hebard did a great job of dialoguing with Greg Goode to extract the genius of Atmananda's teaching on non-duality and the genius of Greg Goode.  Just superb!!!!!!!",1390348800,13,610,4.826923076923077
