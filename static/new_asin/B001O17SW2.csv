8328751,5,B001O17SW2,"I first watched this movie on IFC. The story revolves around a retired police detective, now with Alzheimer's dementia. He is placed in a residential nursing center, where he begins to realize that something is wrong. There is a palpable sense of frustration as you watch him try to investigate while coping with a lack of memory. He keeps a notebook, but has to convince himself that he made the notes and that they can be trusted.
The story is very well done, and the subtitles are not as distracting as I assumed they would be. The acting is really quite good; you can't help but feel the frustration and anger as the lead character copes.

I would highly recommend this movie.",1363564800,,680,4.573770491803279
8328752,3,B001O17SW2,"The three stars are almost entirely for the concept here and probably too generous. This is one of those ideas you read and wonder why no one has thought of it before, and it really excited me. So it's tragic the concept was entirely wasted. The movie plays more like an long episode of Murder She Wrote or any bad cable movie. The production is average, the soundtrack--what little of it there is--adds nothing. The acting is average. There might be a sum total of five minutes of relative suspense. Character development is particularly poorly handled--we have no investment in any of the characters, especially the protagonist; he's likable enough, but without depth he's just an actor hitting his marks. In the end it's  a waste of time. That's a shame...and a sham. Wait for it to hit Prime so at least it's free.",1347494400,,818,4.680555555555555
8328753,5,B001O17SW2,"Great little known (French) movie. The hero is old guy with Alzeimer and incredibly the movie manages to make him totally interesting and enticing . The story keeps you on the edge until the climatic end. The hero is an ex great detective/cop who checks himself in a nursing home as he has been diagnosed with Alzeimer - there, he has to overcome his handicap to save himself as he is surrounded by mysterious deaths. You may think you have seen this type of story before but here (unlike memento) style does not overwhelm content, the story is the focus. The movie also offers a subtle depiction of the way elderly people with this type of handicap are perceived by their entourage and family, even when everybody means well. Both thrilling and moving at times.",1333152000,2,762,4.651851851851852
8328754,4,B001O17SW2,"Extremely enjoyable French production with a very oblique and quietly intense plot. It's not an entirely unique approach, but the character development and story is profound and quite novel; beyond anything I've seen that can be called similar.

'Cortex' unveils the story of a retired police inspector suffering from Alzheimer's, the slow killer of one's memories and eventually the destruction of your very identity - leaving nothing but a broken biological husk to suffer the final indignities of human frailty. Said ailing detective realizes that he can no longer tend to himself or rely on his son to care for him, so he chooses to check into an established care home for similarly stricken citizens: The Residnce.

Once situated, he finds old passions rising to the surface, dormant skill sets re-engaging. The smell of crime in the air. And his deteriorating mind begins to explore what, on the surface, appears to be the strange deaths of his fellow residential patients.

A life spent in dogged police work begins to reemerge - but his thoughts are broken and often incoherent, his abilities hobbled by the disease. What's truly driving his new focus? Is it genuine or the desperate need to once again embrace the life of his past?

Retired detective Charles Boyer finds himself locked in a struggle to uncover a mystery that may only exist in his fractured mind. And despite working against his own best interests, he uses abilities acquired over a lifetime to push on, driving himself, pursuing a path that leads to a terrible revelation.

There's an elegance to this film, an artful battle that occurs entirely within the context of this terrible disease. You can never quite second-guess the plot or the characters; it propels you to many a red herring and multiple mazes that frustratingly dead-end. Is he fighting to uncover the truth? Or is the truth that he is his own worst enemy?

One scene in particular held a great deal of relevance for me personally. Not having ever been in an underground metro - when Charles attempts to reach his son in the city - he's overwhelmed by the bizarre maps and confusing color codes. I truly empathized with the man, it was dizzyingly frenetic and I felt completely lost. Undoubtedly many reviewers will patronizingly dismiss this, but I would challenge you to remember the very first time you entered the subway - as a very young person perhaps, alone without guidance - that would be the equivalent. It's my belief that the film accurately captures the essence of Alzheimer's.

The entire cast was outstanding, particularly the lead - played by Andr Dussolier - who is incredible in his role; completely believable and so agonizingly sympathetic. How this was not considered for any prominent film award is yet another mystery. Director and Writer Nicolas Boukhreif deserves every accolade.

And the ultimate I can offer to honor this fantastic production: See this film.

You won't regret it if character development, an engrossing story, and fresh direction have any meaning to you as a cinephile.",1308700800,,3055,4.974509803921569
8328755,5,B001O17SW2,"This is a bit hard to get because it was a Blockbuster Exclusive and is not on the official market, but hopefully will be at some point.  In the meantime you can track down a used copy.  It is an excellent story, extremely well acted, about an ex-cop with Alzheimer's who takes his gun with him when he becomes a resident of an assisted living community, and begins to suspect the residents are being systematically murdered.  Is it true or is it his own thinking problems because of the Alzheimer's?  Well, I won't reveal the answer but I found this very entertaining, and since I have a parent with this condition I can testify that the portrayal of the memory problems is very realistic.  Very highly recommended.",1255478400,2,716,4.606299212598425
