2081599,5,B0002ERWV4,"Survivor All-Stars had everything. 18 memorable characters, a lot of drama and some of the most intense moments ever.
True, there may be people who questioned Amber's win, or why Boston Rob dominated (cuz he rocks!) and why Elisabeth, Mike Skupin or Brian Heidik were not on, but you can't please everybody.
There were some truly insane moments (Jenna's departure, Sue's outrage and departure, Lex's bitterness, and Shii-Ann's awesome immunity win) this season, and it ranks up there as one of the best seasons.
Definitely worth it. I'm going to pick it up when it comes out!",1087862400,,575,4.938144329896907
2081600,4,B0002ERWV4,"As a fan of Survivor, you might say I've gone a bit overboard. I study the strategy, twists, and every move the players make. In the show's seven previous seasons, 112 people have played the game. In Survivor:All-Stars, 18 of the games best, most popular, and most controversial players return for a second shot at a million dollars. Can they correct the mistakes that cost them the prize the first time?
Sadly, no.
This season quickly became Survivor: No Stars, as the players who finished lower quickly ganged up on previous winners and top finishers. Players who seemed to know the game well made mistakes that most people don't make their first time around, let alone with a second chance. Unfortunately, it no longer was a game of outwit, outplay, and outlast, but simply ""Who can profit the most from the mistakes that Survivor's best players are making?"" That said, this was one of the most emotional seasons, as friendships from outside the game finally came into play. The twists were plentiful and well thought out, often affecting the game in ways never before seen. Your favorite Immunity and Reward Challenges were taken from previous seasons and played again, with extra difficulty for the series' 18 best.
Certainly not the best season Survivor has ever had, but well worth the investment for any true fan of Survivor.
18 former players back for a second chance at a million dollars, but there can only be one.... SURVIVOR!",1087689600,7,1438,4.849593495934959
2081601,1,B0002ERWV4,"PLEASE tell me this is a joke!!  This was one of THE WORST seasons of the show AND it was JUST ON!!!  This season should have been called ""The Boston Rob Show"" and he is one of my least favorite survivors ever.  He and Amber annoyed me to no end.  Where are the DECENT seasons?  Where is Australia, where is Marquesas, Where is Amazon??  All-Stars was absolute BS and the most predictable and boring season of the entire series run.  It was the Second-Worst ""Survivor"" ever (after Thailand).
The worst part about this is that no one will buy it and it will kill the chance of GOOD seasons being released in the future.  Paramount killed ""Real World"" complete season DVD releases the same way.  They released Season One and then the Las Vegas season right after it had been airing 24/7 on MTV.  No one bought it and they haven't released a season since.  These people need to talk to the fans of the show and truly consider releasing older seasons.  Hell, THEY would get more money out of it, so everyone wins.

I really enjoyed getting to see my favorite contestants from the early seasons. Since this was the first cast with ""returning players"" they were all new to the idea of being all stars.

2081696,4,B0002ERWV4,"I am officially going through a Survivor re-appreciation phase. I recently ordered Season 1 (Borneo) as it was the only season I had never seen. After that I simply had to re-watch Season 2 (Australian Outback), which remains for me the best Survivor season ever. Then I turned my attention to Season 8 (All-Stars).

""Survivor All-Stars: The Complete Season)(2004 release; 7 DVDs) reunites many familiar faces for the first time after 7 previous original casts. The names have been mentioned in many other reviews so no need for me to rehash all of them again. Just a couple of comments: first and foremost, Amber was a deserving winner. Looking back with almost 10 years hindsight, she was not just Boston Rob's hanger-on/eventual girlfriend. Amber was smart, likeable, lucky at times, but most of all simple very good (including several impressive wins at the challenges). Boston Rob is equally impressive, and in my opinion is the greatest Survivor player ever. The spat between Lex and Boston Rob (about Lex protecting Amber and then being voted of) became way too personal. It seems that Lex forgot that they were in a game to 'outwit, outlast and outplay' each other. Big Tom is equally the sore loser, and he wasn't even a great player to begin with. Watching the reunion show brought a smile to my face. Who can forget that Boston Rob proposed to Amber, even before the votes of the final Tribal Council were read? Like he said, ""no matter what happens, I've already won"". Hard to believe that it's been 9 years already since this season first aired on TV. (Did you know that Boston Rob and Amber are now the parents of three daughters?)

In all, Survivor All-Stars is a delight to watch from start to finish for any serious fan of Survivor, and even for the mere casual fan of Survivor. It surely ranks as one of the top seasons in Survivor's rich TV history. Can't wait to see the new season in September! Meanwhile, ""Survivor All-Stars"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1372896000,,1970,4.757309941520468

2081724,3,B0002ERWV4,"(Yes I know everyone else puts more spoilers and names in there reviews, this is just my style).

Survivor All Stars is very interesting to watch, yet it makes you dissapointed in what is happening. As this season is full of contestants that previously, most of us liked or were fine with, we must all except that they are in different territory this time. New rules apply as everyone knows who the others are. As such voting strategies go all over the place, liability to the tribe, did they win, are they annoying, personal revenge, tribal lines, is it smart to take them?

As the season progress the energy of the season never fully lets up, but our favorites play their cards: some leave early, some dissapoint, some are betrayed and some try to do what they did do, but aren't as sucessful, resulting in a mix of emotions for the season. Surprisingly quite a few of the filler people manage to carve themselves quite an impression in this season, and one of the worst two players, comes forwards to recreate his/her image and starts to become one of the game's best strategist's.

The end of the season left many different vairables on who could win and one of the game's masterminds comes out on top. It was fun to watch, but you still can't over a few of our favorities doing what they did or how they went out. Out of all the old school seasons this remains as the worst season, that i like.

However what we get with all these dyamic people is even more extra's on the dvds. I can't even begin to figure out how I'm going to sit through that many commentaries, while hearing, of course, many bits of hatred for the top people.",1354752000,,1635,4.44

2081727,5,B0002ERWV4,"Survivor: All Stars, was the best season hands down. I have seen seasons 1, 2, 6, 8, 16, 18 - 23. And All Stars was by far the best. I have seen every episode at least 5 times! They brought back my favorite contestant, Amber Brkich. They also had Boston Rob Mariano, Richard Hatch, Rob Cesternino, Alicia Calaway, and Rupert Boneham! If you are debating on which season to get, get All Stars. No competition. I often don't like the seasons where they bring the Survivors back because they are all like, ""I played this game once before..."" ""I know how this works,"" and blah, blah, blah. But this particular season was very well done. No complaints, except for maybe that they put the order of the people voted out on the from cover of each disk. So, always open the disk upside down and that solves one problem! So that's all my complaints and the bonus footage is hilarious. Awesome season. Favorite one yet!

The cast seems to be different in the way that they are all smug, hate everybody sort of mood.  Take Rob C.  In Amazon he was a witty nerd (sorry Rob C)that enjoys Survivor.  When (spoilers) he gets voted out he is all huffy and puffy and saying to himself Aunnnnnnnnn.  The season is still great (watch Boston Rob stab everyone in the back!) and fun to watch but, do I have to say it, don't buy this one first, do Australia, maybe Amazon, or Africa (notice how they all begin with A, the first letter of the alphabet.)",1321747200,,691,4.269230769230769

I am in the midst of watching this series and after each episode I watch the commentary if there is any. I am completely turned off by the commentary of Lex, Kathy and others on the 4th video. I am surprised that the publishers permitted their comments to be added to the DVD. What a bunch of poor losers who spew such hate and meanspiritedness (is that a word?) into their comments that I found it hard to watch. How Lex can't see that he did the same thing to Ethan (oh but it was okay then cause he already won????)and Kathy sucking up to Rob after Lex was gone when she didn't mean it(that's suppose to be okay?). If you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen.... this is a manipulating game to determine who can outlast, outplay and outwit the others not a let's hold hands and sing ""cumbuya"" together. Sure I have emotional favorites and I've hated a few contestants but when it's over that's it. These people obviously still can't get over losing and they only end up making themselves seem fake and shallow rather than people they are ridiculing.",1309219200,2,1177,4.4036697247706424

The ""bonus features"" for this set was very disappointing.  The Bonus feature disk, is mostly old promo footage, with a brief section on the dream team.  the kids and I were excited to re-watch the shows with commentary, only to discover that the commentary is on less than half of the episodes.  The 4 episodes of commentary with Lex, Shian, Kathy, and Alicia, was not very good.  They are all talking over each other throughout most of the episode and at times Shian and Alicia get into an argument.

2081736,4,B0002ERWV4,"I am a huge Survivor fan, and I relish in things such as delete scenes, uncut exit interviews, commentaries, and other bonus material. This set is the pinnacle of each of those things. There are deleted scenes on every disc, all 14 uncut exit interviews are included, commentaries on more than half of the episodes, and the seventh disc includes a plethora of bonuses that are far and away more than we've gotten on any of the other box sets. Even the America's Tribal Council live special is included. So why am I giving this only a four star rating? There's an episode missing. Given it's a recap episode and most of the scenes from it are featured in other episodes or deleted scenes, but still it makes for an incomplete watchthrough for hardcore completists such as myself. All of the other seasons that had recap episodes have had those episodes included on their respective box sets, so the exclusion of this one is rather bizarre, especially since there was an extra disc dedicated solely to bonus features. If you're a huge Survivor fan, and especially if this is one of your favorite seasons, buy this set. There's almost no chance that there will ever be an updated release featuring the recap episode, and the special features on this set will definitely satisfy your cure for more things Survivor.

BUT...what really annoys me is how people can be so stupid and let an obvious alliance (being rob and amber) control them and pick them off. I mean I think at some points they were even making out in front of everyone else and EVERYONE knew that were together. I think its obvious that they should have tried to vote one of them out. Its just funny that amber won because some of the casting choices were obviously made because their first options told them no. Amber I am almost certain was not one of their first choices to cast. Then she follows that by winning all stars because of a lucky alliance.

So you're going to want to watch this season but expect a lot of stupid decisions. Now if you don't care about that, you will probably love this season. If you do care about that then you will probably be like me and think its kind of entertaining, but mostly stupid. Since it is All Stars it will get second best season but the Australian Outback is still the best.",1219968000,,1182,4.343891402714932

If you make the mistake of looking at the disk or the DVD box before you pop it into your player, you'll experience a show-spoiler... the pictures on the disk and box reveal who was voted off on the episodes of that disk!

I couldn't believe my eyes! The show is supposed to be a mystery. I'm furious at having been forced to avert my eyes every time I put in a new disk.

It brings back some of the most memorable and successful ""survivors"" from the first seasons and pits them against each other. If you are a reality show fan, this should be at the top of your list. If your a survivor fan, you've seen it already, but it's time to watch it again. Fun and light viewing.",1214956800,,470,4.233333333333333
2081760,5,B0002ERWV4,"When I first heard that they were going to do an All-Star version of Survivor, I was ecstatic. Just the thought of seeing previous players from different season play against each other was a dream come true for me.

(May contain SPOILERS!)

Nothing stopped me from reading spoilers from the infamous ChillOne before the show began airing. I wanted to know a little information before the season started. Yet when the show aired, my excitement did not wane. I tuned obediently to every episode. I was very active on message board(s) for the show. I played the Ancient Voices theme over and over.

Despite other people's dislike for the outcome as each episode progressed, my opinion did not change. I was a fan of AMBER when she was in AUSTRALIA. To see her get far and do well in the game was amazing. I always felt she was underestimated; and it helped her in the game as she was not viewed as a threat.

BOSTON ROB was one of the characters I did not like in MARQUESAS. But I will admit that he impressed me with his (more) aggressive strategy for ALL-STARS. Arguably, he played like what the other ALL-STAR SURVIVOR should've played like.

This season had it all: challenges that exhausted the contestants, amazing rewards (two cars), backstabbing, tribal swap, fights (e.g., Rob Vs. Lex, Jerri Vs. Rupert), dramatic exit (Jenna Morasca), unusual quit (Sue), name-callings, tears, a very emotional final tribal council, a very angry jury, a very tense reunion, and the very first Survivor romance.

This DVD boxed set was ordered here from Amazon and sent to me by a friend. It's very nice to rewatch the episodes in clear quality. I still get excited just by watching the first episode alone (one of the best in Survivor history) even if I have seen it so many times before.

There are cast commentaries for more than 5 episodes. The first group of commentators led by Rob Cesternino are good. The bonus footage are really great as well. The set has extra footage for the challenges, casting, post-show interviews, and even clips that were not aired on TV.

The recap episode that aired on TV is not present here. But the favorite clip from that episode in which Chapera mocked Saboga's first tribal council is included in longer form as a bonus feature.

It's a must-own DVD. Many people have cited All-Stars as one of the truly great seasons before the show arguably became a parody of itself. It's a great season that will leave you with lots of memories.",1208217600,,2462,4.680555555555555

The people that wouldn't be affaid of making moves were voted off early or couldn't because players would not budge. It had some great moments in the season too. Like Rich ""rubbing"" Sue, Sue's break down and then ripping Jeff a new one, Jenna's mom, the godfather move that Boston Rob did to Lex, Boston Robb calling Big Tom son dumb and the Jury meltdown. Also the cast commentaries was great. You could clearly hear that these people have not gotten over it. A fight happen between Shi-ann and Alicia in the commentaries. Also Lex hates Robb so much that he saw some kids with a Boston Redsocks hat and wanted to hurt them. Now that it's under 30 dollars it differnly worth the purchase if your a survivor fan.",1195603200,,890,4.367469879518072
2081763,1,B0002ERWV4,"After giving Survivor Allstars a 5 star review, I had to rethink my position as I finished watching disc 6.  In fact, I'm sure EVERYONE will disagree with what I'm about to say and if I could be 'booed off stage like Jerri was, I'm sure I would be.

I'm not sure how many times the word ""Game"" was used throughout the DVD but it must have been several hundred times.  It's just a game.  It's just a game.  It's just a game - was used like some reality show mantra.  But was it?  On further review - 'the game' was anything but.  In fact, it is a display of the worse of human nature.  Deception, deceit, dishonesty, greed and selfishness.  It's a game that someone 'wins' by employing the most ruthless of tactics and I truly believe what Kathy and Lex told Rob at the last tribal council.  That its not a game and it that it is, in fact, a true test of personal character and how you want to represent yourself to the world.

I was even more amazed when Jerri spoke up telling the audience that Survivor was NOT just a game and that everything that had happened to the participants took something out of them personally, emotionally and physically and then was booed by the audience to the point she felt she had to leave the show.  Of course the audience would not agree with her because that would implicate THEM in that greed, dishonesty and deceit which is an integral part of the show ""Survivor"".  It is the Christians and the Lions all over again.  A spectacle of broken relationships, friendships and lives for the spectacle of us - the blood thirsty masses.

And then Jeff (the narrator's) response basically telling Jerri that if she didn't like it she could leave at any time.  What an AH.  But what else would you expect from the moderator of the show.  Mean-spirited throughout.  THAT is the basis of Survivor.

So as long as we as a country continue to endorse shows like this - shows that not only condone 'greed at any cost' - but shows that endorse the ""Winner"" rather than what the group has to offer as a whole (and all for the sake of money) - we will continue to promote self-centeredness, selfishness and the WORST of human character defects that are, in my opinion, anything but ""Entertainment"".",1193788800,7,2218,4.42716049382716

2081765,5,B0002ERWV4,"I swore to myself I would never become a Survivor fan.  I watched other reality TV shows, sure, but Survivor was just ridiculous and degrading.  Or so I thought.  Last summer, I was watching TV and after doing some channel surfing and finding that there was nothing good on, I decided to watch an episode of Survivor.  OLN (aka VS.) was doing a summer marathon of Survivor episodes, and All Stars was on at that moment.  I forget exactly which episode I saw, but I know it was before Jenna M. left to be with her mom.  I watched one episode...and then another...and then another...and then another...and before I knew it, I was hooked.  I didn't even go online to check the winner before watching the ""live"" season finale...which I loved in so many ways.  I bought the DVD within weeks and decided to give the other seasons a chance.  None of the ones I've seen (Borneo, Australia, Pearl Islands, part of Vanuatu, Palau, part of Maya Empire, Exile Island, and this season's Cook Islands) matches up to All Stars, but I WILL say that Pearl Islands comes close.

Why do I love the season so much?  I think it's because this season reminds me of the classic fairy tale ending in which everyone get what they deserves.  For example:

Kathy: At first, I liked Kathy.  After seeing the All Stars DVD a second time, I realized that she's actually a nasty player.  Kathy was going to betray her tribe and join Chapera.  She was the second Mogo Mogo after the merge to get voted off.

Shii Ann: I love Shii Ann.  Shii Ann did everything that she could do to get ahead in the game but when she got voted off, she didn't have Sue's reaction from season one.  Most importantly, she voted for Amber, realizing that Amber had the best strategy.  Her reward?  A car.

Rob: Rob played the game well but ultimately his lies caught up to him.  Still, he got Amber and the two will share the million, so he honestly deserved second place.

Amber: Where to begin?  I love Amber to death!  She played the game so well, with such a good strategy, that I believe that had Tina been on the jury, Amber would have received her vote.  She didn't lie so much as break promises and she never said anything bad about the other players.  Amber is the best Survivor player EVER, hands down.

Lex: After backstabbing NUMEROUS people, Lex finally got what he deserved; betrayal, handed to him by Rob.  Based on the commentary, it doesn't sound like the two are friends.  Well, that's Lex's loss.

Rupert: Probably the most honorable player there and definitely unfairly axed before his time on Pearl Islands, Rupert deserved to win the second million dollar prize.

So, my concluding thoughts...best season ever.  Don't let anyone tell you differently!  If you can only buy one season on DVD, buy this one.",1163721600,,2773,4.544534412955466
2081766,5,B0002ERWV4,"This season was by far the greatest, for many reasons. The three tribes, Mogo Mogo (consisting of Lex, Kathy, Shii Ann, Colby, Richard, Jenna M.), Chapera (consisting of Boston Rob, Big Tom, Amber, Alicia, Sue, and Rob C.), and Saboga (consisting of Rupert, Rudy, EZ, Jenna L. Jerri, and Tina. One of the best parts was that there was no fire until day for. That made the survival aspect even greater. And another great moment was Richard Hatch finally getting his torch snuffed.

This season took place in Panama, like Pearl Islands, which rained almost non-stop. Some of the camps had plantaans, others had fish. Almost every tribe complained about the weather. That was one of the bad parts.

These players have already played the game before, they know who to trust, who to not trust, and who are the snakes. This was bad for Rob C. and Hatch, and almost all the previous winners.

This is what I think of the players who made the jury.

Amber was a good player, putting all of the bad things she did on Rob, and she could of handled the Lex and Kathy situation better.

Rob was my least favorite of them all. He was a huge liar, and treated the other players with no respect and class

Jenna would not shut up.

Rupert was a good physical player, but not a very good strategic player. But everyone likes him.

Big Tom is great, although you can't understand him.

Shii Ann was not really let into the game in Thialand, and this season shows how she plays.

Alicia sums it up when she says Amber and Rob outplayed, outwitted, and outlasted them, but didn't outclass them.

Kathy is awesome. And funny.

2081769,4,B0002ERWV4,"When he decided to bring back 18 former contestants for Survivor All Stars, creator Rob Burnett thought he had another winning idea. The all star contestants picked were, Amber Brkich, Rob Mariano, Genna Lewis, Rupert Boneham, ""Big"" Tom Buchanan, Shiii Ann Huang, Alicia Calloway, Kathy Vavrick-O'brien, Lex Van Den Berghe, Jerri Manthey, Ethan Zohn, Colby Donaldson, Sue Hawk, Richard Hatch, Rob Cesternino, Jenna Morasca, Rudi Boesch, and Tina Wesson.  One may quibble with some of the selections, but these players were for the most part, among the more memorable or successful players of the game, including four past winners.  Despite some memorable twists and turns, All Stars turned out to be the `Rob and Amber' show.  The alliance turned romance not only `survived"", but produced a live on air proposal, with Amber then being named the sole survivor.

Familiarity with the contestants makes All Stars a whole new game for both the players and the audience, with past winners targeted for early elimination.  Things proceed without any major bumps until Jenna M, in probably the most poignant Survivor moment ever, decides to bow out in order to be with her dying mother.  Then another surprise, when Sue also decides to quit, after being `traumatized' by Richard during a challenge.  Some pretty emotional stuff.

The physical group challenges as usual, are very exciting and competitive.  It is painful to watch survivors get smacked down during the block puzzle.  The boat building challenge was another fun event.  The flag capture on the balance beams produced a number of thrilling spills, and fortunately no one was seriously injured.

Other notable events include Richard's shark encounter, the very improbable tribal switch, where Amber was joined by all the members of the opposing tribe, the shelter building contest where Rupert encounters an immovable tree root, and Shii Ann's immunity challenge win.

As the game progressed, Boston Rob and Amber formed more than an alliance.  Opportunities to breakup the power couple were not taken, and the pair took control.  Rob was criticized for his backstabbing ways, but he was not alone.  Colby was ousted thanks to Ethan's ploy, with Ethan in turn done in by his buddy Lex.  Richard was `bamboozled"" and sent packing, and ""Big' Tom was steaming mad after being completely blindsided.

Like them or not, when the money was in `smelling' distance, Rob and Amber showed their true determination to win.  Rob M won the final immunity challenge, and Amber the second to the last.  Genna slit Rupert's line, only to have the shifting of her foot cost her a chance at a million dollars.  All this, leading up to an emotional final tribal council with the jury, where the sparks did fly.  The customary reunion show provided the platform for Rob's proposal to Amber, the announcement of the winner, and the usual recap.  The new twist was that the festivities were extended to a second program where Rupert was also awarded a million bucks, based on votes cast by the public.

What really adds spice to the proceedings on DVD are the commentary tracks, which are quite revealing and inflammatory at times.  Early exiters Rob C, Jenna M, Rudy and Tina contributions are rather light hearted and fun.  The fireworks start when Lex, Kathy, Shii Ann, and Alicia get together with Boston Rob in their sights.  Their dislike for the `Robfather' is almost universal, with Genna L and Amber also on the hit list.  It's refreshing that we are allowed to hear some real shots taken.  Got to love the honesty.

The final four of Rob M, Amber, Genna L and Rupert provide commentary for the last few episodes.  They have little to say about those they have outplayed, mainly focusing on themselves.  If you disliked any of them, the commentary probably won't change your mind, except maybe for Rupert.  Mr Tie Dye was clearly steamed with Genna after being voted out, but winning a million bucks in the popular vote transformed a fierce competitor into a satisfied pussycat, who has very little to say.

Survivor has continued to be successful by evolving and keeping the game interesting.  Some may find that they way things played out this time, somewhat disappointing, but Survivor is after all, just a game.",1141776000,11,4257,4.973125884016973

Yes, you know who I speak of... Rob & Amber. However having already seen the season, I decided to rent this and watch it again since it's been awhile and I couldn't remember how people were eliminated nor did I remember the challenges, so it was fun to watch again. But the BEST thing about the dvd set, is the commentary! If you couldn't stand Boston Rob through this season, you'll love the commentary! It was so great to hear other people voice their very open opinions of him that many of us viewers thought along the way. Are the losers bitter? Heck yeah...just like any of us would be when you look back in hind site. They all admit they were stupid for not seeing Rob and Amber being such a huge threat or rather ...they lacked the guts to break them up. If you hadn't seen it, you'll definitely find yourself yelling at the tv screen for the idiots to wake up. Anyways, its a fun season. Knowing who won, doesn't spoil it! Its great watching it all unfold! And like I said its definitely worth watching for the MANY commentaries...10 to be exact. Check it out!",1137974400,4,1320,4.369918699186992
2081782,4,B0002ERWV4,"I know it has become fashionable to declare :""I hate reality TV"", and for those dear souls this would be torture. I, quite frankly. LOVE good reality TV and Survivor is a WONDERFUL idea for this genre of television -very well executed, with clever editing and sound (granted - sometimes used in a partial way to influence the viewer's stance towards an idea/person/sub-plot)and has very high production values. I enjoyed watching the ALL-STARS again, especially to see (in hindsight) the shenanigans of Boston Rob and the gradual budding romance with Amber! Great to see familiar faces in new surroundings - for example the original ""master"" Richard and the unofficial winner of series 2 Colby, ""only-to-be-understood-when-you-are-drunk-yourself"" Big Tom etc etc Lots of extras and also commentary tracks on some episodes. Would have liked to hear more background on the Sue ""(scream)I WAS VIOLATED"" incident, but that was somehow snuffed. Great entertainment.",1137628800,4,960,5.406666666666666
2081783,5,B0002ERWV4,"This was the best season. The only con is the fact that they ordered the pictures on the front in how they were voted out.  Terrible idea.  If you have forgotten the order then hide the cover for at least some surprise to remain.  Whoever decided to do the cover like that needs to bring me their torch!!  Having said that, it is risky to do an all stars.  It's kind of like the risk Amazing Race took with the Family Edition.  The AR special edition season did not pay off.  Fortunately Survivor's risk did.  It paid off big time. This is the only season I actually own on DVD and that is because it is good enough to watch it over and over again.  The main reason for that is because of Rob Mariano.  He is a hoot.  I think he's the best player of the game yet.  If you don't like Rob then don't buy this season.  This DVD could be more aptly titled the Mariano edition.  I would not have necessarily picked all of these individuals to be considered ""all stars"" but a lot of that has to do with who agreed to actually put themselves through this one more time.  Rob was only slightly memorable from the first time he was on the show but this time he was ruthless.  If you are the type that watches Survivor in hopes that no one will actually ""play"" then you'll hate this one!!  People you loved last time may become villains.  Those who were masterful before are easily voted out.  This is truly full of surprises.  No matter how many times these people play the game of Survivor the outcome is going to be different every time.",1134950400,17,1530,4.228373702422146

2081785,4,B0002ERWV4,"I was glad to see some of my favorite players return (Tina, Colby, Ethan, Hatch, Shiian, Lex, Big Tom, Kathy, Rob C., Jenna M, and Rudy).  What makes this show so interesting is that every single vote affected the course of the game.  If Rudy and Rupert had showed some brains in the beginning and voted off Jenna Lewis as opposed to Tina, I think we would have been treated to a season of All Stars playing like All Stars rather than the cry baby sore losers getting so far in the game because they weren't smart enough to take out Rob and Amber due to the fact that they were too busy taking out the past winners and power players to pay attention.  I do think that Rob and Amber played a great game, but the success of the game was based on the fact that niether had played well in their respective seasons and there were winners and other good players to take out.

I enjoy the earlier episodes a lot more than the later ones because my favorite players were still around.  We started out with Survivor All-Stars and ended with Survivor: Sheep and whiny Crybaby sore losers

Saboga:

Jenna Lewis-should have been the first person voted off because she was the worst player.  Right off the bat, she was determined to eliminate the winners.  Which is somewhat understandable, but they were still members of her team.  She was very ude about it too.  She lucky Ethan played as hard as he did in the challenges.  A lesser man would have given her the finger and walked off.  Speaking of challenges, Jenna is responsible for her team losing them.  Not only did she hurt team unity by ailienated 1/3 of her tribe, but she kept wimping out in the challenges then yelling at people trying to get things done, then had the nerve to blame Ethan who was working on bailing out water while she was just sitting there.  It's a shame that a player like her made it to third place in a game call ALL STARS, but hey Rob and Amber took her that far because she wasn't strong enough, smart enough or likeable enough to be a threat.  It shows what poor sports Alicia and even two of favorites, Lex and Tom were that they would have voted for a terrible player like Jenna Lewis to win over Boston Rob.  I know he screwed them over, but they should have known better than to trust him.

Jerri-should have gone second.  The only time I saw her really play was when she tried to get Colby voted off.

Rupert-He's likeable, but I just never jumped on his bandwagon.  He seemed to think he was entitled to win Pearl Islands.  Um, no one is entitled to win Survivor.  You have to earn it by playing the game.  Then in All Stars he was too territorial with the fishing Rod, and refusing to give people fish?  I'm sorry, but he was the one who insisted on having that task.  And most other people had their own jobs as well.  Don't get me started on the shelter and the raft.  He just didn't want to be told he was wrong on that.  Oh and then playing the pity party of being made fun of as a kid then making fun of Ethan trying to catch fish?  I was made fun of as a kid too, but I don't cry about it then make fun of others.

Rudy-gotta love him, but he was stupid to keep Jenna over Tina.  He said in the beginng there was no reason to vote people out, well how about them being an anchor on your tribe who annoys and ailinates everyone (Jenna).  I gotta love Rudy though.  his strength as a player is that he says so much with so few words as opposed to Jenna Lewis who says so little with too many words.

Tina-the woman who made me love survivor.  A truly smart player who could have been a great asset to Saboga.  It sucked to see her as the first bootee.  That was a sad day for Survivor.

Ethan-Along with Tina, one of the smartest players.  Too bad people were so determined to vote out the winners that they didn't see what valueable allies they could be.  I've seen a lot of people say that Ethan rode Lex's coattails in Africa.  I'd say that Ethan carried Lex.  He was in a good enough position that he could have jumped ship and joined forces with Frank and Teresa and Kim Johnson would have jumped with him.  Lex nearly destroyed the Boran Boys club the way he dealt with his ONE vote and refusing to vote for Brandon.  Big Tom probably could have ditched Lex too.  Ethan had good ideas, but no one wanted to listen.  I'll get to that later.  It's a pity we didn't get to see Ethan and Tina work as a team because they could have made a good one, possibly even better than Colby and Tina in Austraila.  What makes Ethan and Tina the two most deserving winners, IMO is that the Jurors voted for them to win based on the way they had played the game, not because they (the Jurors) were mad at the person sitting next to them.

Sheepera, I mean Chapera

Sue-a She-Hulk in the challenges, but not a great Survivor players.  I don't think Rich should have did what he did in the balance beam, but Sue was not the victim she claimed to be, sorry.

Alicia-I liked her better in Austraila.  She sat out too many of Chapera's challenges, never thought to make alliances, and just plain did not understand the game.  I wanted to puke hearing some members of Sheepera complain about winners not deserving to be there, they had their chance, blah blah blah.  It's called ALL STARS, as in great players.  Sore loser, piss poor players had their chance too, why did they deserve to be there?  Jenna L, Sue, Amber, Boston Rob (who is tough when he's in the majority but pretty whiny when in the minority)  I'm looking at you.  At least Amber anf Rob made up for their poor playing the first time by playing better.

Big Tom-I love him.  His problem in both Africa and All Stars was that he sold himself short.  He was too determined to go into the final two with someone who had pissed off the jury.  He seemed to think it was the only way he could win.  He was too determined to  face the jury with Lex in Africa, although in that case, I can't blame him for not wanted to go up against Golden boy Ethan.  But in All Stars, he probably could have beaten anyone in the final five, including Rupert.  He definately had Lex's vote.

Rob C.-Too bad his rep for being a good player made Sheepera shake in their boots.

Amber-based on her previous season, she did not deserve to be on ALL Stars, like everyone on Sheepera other than Big Tom and Rob C.  She did play a great game this time.  She played the man who played everyone else.  Rob was lost without her.

Rob-he was right to vote out Lex and Kathy and keep Sheepera together.  The thing I can't stand about him as a person is the fact that he has a vendetta against guys hotter and or smarter than him.  Rob C. is the better Rob.  Ethan and Colby are waaayyy hotter than he is.

Mogo Mogo

This was the coolest tribe, unfortunetly they were all great players, thus weary of each other.  It hurt them as a team.

Hatch-he was hilarious this season.  People may have seen him as a villian, but he did stick with his alliance in Borneo.  People seem to forget that.

Lex-  I love Lex.  He has all the makings for a great survivor player.  He's very intelligent, has many skills, and is great in challenges.  What he lacks is common sense.  He was too determined to get rid of Richard and Colby (and probably Ethan) before the merge that he didn't realize they could have been a great help to him once the merge happened.  In Africa, he got votes whenever he didn't have immunity, but in Africa, his alliance had the majority so it didn't matter.  He told Ethan that he was keeping Jerri around because she wasn't a threat.  Well,  Mogo Mogo was in the minority at that point, and when a tribe is Pagonged, it is the biggest threats that go first.  And miking the deal with Rob, well that is another problem Lex had in both Africa and All Stars, he can't seem to Fathom that he isn't the only one playing the game.  He saw Malice in the vote T-Bird (who should has been in All Stars as opposed to Jenna L or Jerri, she Ethan and Tina would have made a great team) and blamed Kelly caused a riot that not only nearly cost himself the game, but Ethan, Tom and Kim as well.  He also said he'd use Friendship to get further in the game, but couldn't fathom that Boston Rob would do the same.  Lex continued to keep Jerri when he should have voted her out, then when he finally should have kept her, he tossed her for Amber.

Colby-He shouldn't have told the Sh-devil what he thought of her.  He's a good player, but got cocky in tribal council when Hatch was voted out and it cost him.  For the most part, he is a good player, but he lets everyone know how good he is.  That puts a target on him, which is why I said that Ethan and Tina could have made an even better team that Colby and Tina did.  I still love Colby though.

Shiian-She's a smart player, but she should have put her intelligence to a more practical use early on.  Like voting with Ethan and Colby to oust Jerri.  I know she was mad a Colby, but she could have played him later on.  If Lex had gotten angry, Colby and Ethan would have had Shiian's back.  Ethan wasn't afraid of Lex in Africa and wouldn't have feared him in All Stars, as much as he said he didn't want to ruffle feathers.

Kathy-a great power player who had people wrapped around her fingers.  The only problem was she didn't question Lex enough.  I know she valued her alliance with him, but his decisions hurt her in the end.

Jenna M.-I don't care what people say, her Amazon win was well deserved.  She's a smasrt player.  I cried for her when she lost  her mother and wish she didn't have to go through it.  She could have been a great player in All Stars were it not for unfortunate extenuating circumstances.

As Far as the extras on the DVD, they were good, but too few.  I wanted more extra scenes and to see everyone's audition tapes.  The audio commentary on the first four episodes is great.  Jenna M., Rob C. Tina, and Rudy, were entertaining to listen to and had some good insights.  I'd definately rather hang out with those four than the final four.  Rob M, Amber, Rupert and Jenna L were just plain BORING to listen to *yawn*  But hey that was the way the season went.  Smart, interesting people gone early, boring people lasting until the end.",1132444800,,10216,4.2518210197710715

Don't look at the pictures on front of every disk if you want surprises. If you don't care then you'll know who exactly get voted off with each disc and worse, you'll know who wins when you see them on the last sole disc.

Otherwise, this show was GREAT!! and therefore gets 4 stars, but really zero stars for ruining the surprises. Fire that putz that decided to blow it for people that have not watched it. Me, one of them.

The only other thing that was pathetic was the commentary by Lex, Kathy and Alicia who spend their valuable audio time on the bonus commentary bickering like teenagers over Boston Rob. Making ridiculous statements that Rob betrayed Lex etc. and that people were lying. Duh!!! The game is about outwitting, betraying, lying, and outsmarting everyone.

2081793,5,B0002ERWV4,"I still don't understand why so many people thought that Survivor All-Stars was a bad season. Anybody who is a true survior-fanatic thrives on watching the extreme politics, fierce mental and physical competition and the strategic moves of the players. This season has all of this, and then some.

What made it so great was that it invloved the most memorable chracters from previous seasons. Some of the most loved, most hated and most devious people were brought back (like Shii-Ann, Rob C, Rob M and of course the infamous Richard Hatch) and thrown together, resulting in a mosaic of so many different types of gameplay.

However, what made this box set truly incredible were the special features. There are so many aspects of the season that weren't aired (such as the inter-tribal letters), and every disc is jam packed with snippets of game-twists, various strategic moves and interesting events, which viewers otherwise would have been in the dark about. Other examples of special features are the complete ""final words"" for ALL the contestants and audio commentaries from contestants for most of the episodes.

2081797,4,B0002ERWV4,"Okay, first of all, to those who have labelled ""Survivor: All-Stars"" as being 'boring' and 'predictable', stop reading this review right now! While many, of course, may think that the Survivor formula is wearing a little thin at this stage (this is the eight season), Mark Burnett can always be depended upon to throw in some new elements to screw people's expectations up. The primary example of this lies in the fact that now, not only are there 18 contestants taking part, and forming 3 new tribes, but that these 18 contestants have all taken part in the show before-they know each other and know the format of the show (not to mention the strategies of each other).
This is just part of the brilliance of ""All-Stars"".
Here we see many of our favourites from the past 7 seasons battling it out once again for that now synonymous million-dollar prize. What better way to enjoy this than the complete DVD box set that is packed with special featurettes and interviews and behind the scenes footage (All in a staggering seven-disk set).
The first six disks contain all 13 episodes of the season (each presented in full-screen format that is of the highest picture and sound quality), as well as a host of special features such as never-before-seen footage, extended confessional-booth interviews with each castaway and audio commentary on most of the episodes with the All-Stars. The sixth disk also contains the reunion show, where the castaways are reunited to discuss the events of the season and account for some of their actions while on the island. Following this is the exclusive Survivor: All-Stars, America's Tribal Council, where the American public were given the chance to reward one survivor with another million dollars (Who could it be?). This also contains polls such as Survivor's sexiest women and men, the most devious villain, and the greatest survivor moment of all time, as voted by the American public.
The seventh disk is a special-features bonanza! Here, viewers get an insight into how the survivor challenges are designed and developed; view promos from the past 7 seasons; witness the casting process with the casting director and the final four All-Stars; see exclusive interviews with each of the All-Stars.
This really is an excellent disk, allowing those of us who can only imagine what it's like to be involved in Survivor an insightful look behind the scenes (and beyond).
What I was also pleasantly surprised with was that, unlike the packaging of ""Survivor: Borneo, the complete season"", which (almost unfairly) revealed the name of each survivor to be voted off on the back of each disk, ""All-Stars"", thankfully, omits this flaw, whilst still giving a short synopsis on each episode.
One thing I will say, though, is that, if you are a new-comer to the whole Survivor phenomenon (bit slow, aren't you?), then I would recommend you first buy ""Survivor: Borneo, the complete season"" and start at the beginning. I don't mean that every season is interconnected, and that you have to have seen them from the beginning to understand it all. YOU DON'T! But, I think All-Stars is the wrong place to start, as, in the opening episode, it gives an account of each of survivors playing the game, and how each contestant did in their past season. All-Stars does include a few past winners, and it just doesn't seem right to have them revealed to you in a instant before actually waiting to see the seasons in full.
""Survivor: All-Stars"" is well worth the marked price (remember; you're getting 7 disks. 7!) and contains twists and turns that equals the intrigue of the original ""Survivor: Borneo"".

2081801,5,B0002ERWV4,"I have never been much of a fan of reality television, but there have been a few exceptions. I watched the original Survivor simply because it was new, it had never been done before and I found that entertaining and compelling. After the first season I didn't return to Survivor until the All-Star edition began after last year's Super Bowl. The reason I tuned in? Because it was new and different. Nobody had ever returned to play this game a second time.

Coming into this game, the All-Stars had to know that this was going to be different. Everything was going to be stepped up a notch and they had to bring their A games. As soon as the tribes set foot on the island, the elevated level of survival came boiling to the surface, as winners (of which there were four) realized that they had a huge target on their backs, and alliances began to form, one of which lasted until the bitter end.

While Amber Brkich (Survivor Australia) walked away with the million dollar prize at the end of the game, this season, in every sense of the word, belonged to Boston Rob Mariano. He dominated the physical challenges and was incredibly strong in the mental ones as well. He outplayed everyone on the island, using everything he could, including friendships, to get him to the final two. It is kind of depressing on the commentaries and on the episodes themselves, to listen to the constant whining of Lex and Alicia. Both of these All-Stars were played by Boston Rob. He used them to get to the end, wh ich is the whole idea. They cried like babies about it and it is sad. Like original winner Richard Hatch said in the reunion show, ""It's just a game."" They should realize that he outplayed them, accept it and move on with their lives.

As I said, Boston Rob outplayed everyone in the game, but he didn't win the million dollars, as I feel he probably deserved. He lost out because of the bitterness of two people who felt betrayed, in a game where betrayal always comes into play.

For the All-Stars, Rupert, Jerri, Colby, Sue, Richard, Big Tom and the others provided plenty of entertainment. The challenges were extremely tough, probably the hardest ever, as they should be. You could see the complete exhaustion in the faces of these seasoned veterans of the game. This was not a walk in the jungle for anyone.

While there are many people who could have been cast, it is possible, many didn't want to return to the game. I am sure there are a lot of people who would have liked to have seen Colleen, Greg and Gervase from Season One, or Michael Skupin or Elisabeth Filarski (Hasselbeck) from Australia, or any number of others. Despite all that, the All-Stars chosen were a diverse bunch and made for solid competition.

The DVD set has a number of great extras, with lots of unaired scenes and confessionals. While the recap episode (Number Nine) is not included on this set, the best scene from that episode, the mock tribal council with Rob Cesternino's dead-on Jeff Probst impression, is included in the extra scenes. In addition there are a number of commentaries, including four featuring the hilarious Cesternino at the head of the pack.

While this season didn't end up being the best Survivor ever, as claimed in the promos (In my mind that honor goes to season one), this was a pretty solid effort. It had never been done before and that in and of itself made it worth watching.

Go out and buy this set. It is worth it. I also highly recommend purchasing the set from Season One, if for no other reason than the incredibly beautiful Colleen Haskell.",1099872000,11,3562,4.572100313479623

This DVD also had tips on how you could be a possible survivor, and lots and lots of bonus coverage.

The reason i voted 4 stars is because the season lacked a little, but the DVD in the end makes up for it.

If your a survivor fan, this DVD is a must get, plus its pretty cheap, compared to other shows full seasons.",1095897600,2,969,4.2896174863387975

I was so happy to see Survivor Allstars(S8) on DVD but i was very disapointed that the seasons were not released by order of Season.

2081807,3,B0002ERWV4,"For all those who might be getting bored of all the seasons of Survivor over the years, and might decide to watch something else, here comes a version of Survivor with all your favorite characters together.  Is it just what you asked for?

Yes, Survivor.  The show that started the reality TV show craze on network TV (and some cable networks, I guess), which has really been blown out of proportions to an insane level.  The show that is to blame, although it can be argued that MTV's The Real World and Road Rules were to blame, but not with me.

The characters (or should I say people) on this edition of Survivor are:  Alicia, Amber, Colby, Jerri, and Tina from 'Outback'.  Ethan, Lex, and Tom from 'Africa'.  Jenna L, Rudy, and Sue from 'Borneo'.  Jenna M and Rob C from 'Amazon'.  Kathy and Rob M from 'Marquesas'.  Rupert from 'Pearl Islands', and Shii Ann from 'Thailand'.  Who will win the money?!

Reality TV, the event that focuses on embarrissing situations, and drama among ridiculous castmembers to boost ratings.  Yes, reality TV.  Many love it, I really don't.  Bad drama is one thing that I try to stay away from in my life because I believe that stress kills.  But that doesn't mean that I want to watch people I don't know get involved in bad situations.

For those who have liked the Survivor series, go ahead and check this one out.  But I warn you, just because it has some of the better castmembers in it doesn't mean the other aspects of the show is going to be good.  If anything, it would make the writers slack off some, knowing that the cast is going to sell the show.",1095033600,,1596,4.437931034482759
2081808,3,B0002ERWV4,"All Stars...Well...it was an OK season, but maddening in it's spotlight of incredibly stupid decisions people made.

It has it's moments.  Hatch is as annoying as ever.  Lex is inexplicably naive.  Jeri is smart but irritating.  And the fact that there is such an in-your-face, obvious alliance between Rob and Amber, and NO ONE bothers to break them apart or even question this alliance.  It's as if appearing on other seasons never taught anyone anything.  And Rob and Amber were by no means secretive about their relationship.  So, an obvious alliance is allowed to orchestrate the game.  It is just maddening, as a viewer, to see presumably smart people act so dumb.

All in all...nothing new to see here, unless you are a SERIOUS Survivor fan.  Otherwise...this can be one for the rental que.",1095033600,6,797,4.873134328358209
2081809,2,B0002ERWV4,"Perhaps the expectations were just too high, but this edition of Survivor, which was touted as ""the best of the best"" didn't even come close to the greatness achieved by other editions of the show, such as Australia, Amazon or Panama. At the very core of why this show didn't work was that these contestants knew each other and they had played this game before. All of the wonder and awe and ""newness"" of the adventure was lost as mediocre players banded together to greedily oust the players that actually knew how to play the game and had bested them before.

This was the ""revenge"" series and ultimately it floundered under its own weight of bitterness, childish behavior and ultimate predictability. I expected better from those who had played before, and I was disappointed by the lack of individual game-play, the fear of taking risks, and the colony of lemmings that just jumped off the cliffs without trying out any type of strategy that could save themselves.

Of course, the one great thing about this series was that we were able to see some old favorites return. Seeing Rudy, Ethan, Colby, Jerri, Kathy, Tina and Richard (among others) playing together was a wonderful treat. It's just too bad that each contestant was pre-judged before the game even began and that those who had proven their worth to be there (past winners/excellent schemers) were the very first ones targeted for elimination. This was the biggest deteriment to the series, as most of the more colorful and interesting players were snuffed out far too quickly.

In addition, this was the first series (and hopefully the only one) in which two players quit in the middle of the game. Not only is this anti-climactic (two shows with no Tribal Council), but also takes away from the spirit and adventure of the game. While Susan and Jenna had valid reasons for their decisions, it just does not make for good Survivor.

While a disappointing edition of the series, the show does have some interesting moments. Shii Ann's final stand to save herself from elimination during the bucket challenge is as exciting as television gets and the Lex/Kathy/Rob fiasco is fascinating to watch as it plays out. Jerri tried hard to develop a new image and almost succeeded until the reunion show and Richard's wrestling match with a shark is pure Survivor gold.

As a whole, however, the series is just too full of meanness, bitterness and personal issues between the contestants. Game-play is almost non-existant as the last group of remaining players just casually allow Rob and Amber to coast to the end. And, while I agree that the Final Tribal Council is the most ""personal"" of the series, it just comes off as an over-dramatic therapy session.

In all, not the worst of the series (that dubious honor goes to Thailand), but far from the quality of entertainment we have come to expect from this show. It was a promising experiment that didn't deliver, but still I would recommend it to only the most hard-core of Survivor fans.",1094342400,7,2997,4.809708737864078
2081810,2,B0002ERWV4,"As someone who's seen every season of Survivor, I honestly felt this to be the weakest of them all. As the ""All-Stars"" had already been through the game before, there was little amazement at the experience, and it was purely strategic playing that was going on. Good for the players, but not for the audience.

Still, as an admitted Survivor-addict, I purchased this boxed set. What can I tell you about this DVD compilation?

First, despite claiming to be ""Survivor All-Stars: The Complete Season,"" this set is actually INcomplete. When you get to Disc 4, look at the packaging: the episode numbers jump from 808 to 810. 809, which was the recap show ""The First 24 Days,"" was inexplicably left out. True, no one actually cares about the episode when they're watching this series on a weekly basis, but to have a ""complete"" set that has deleted scenes but is missing one episode which had other deleted scenes is bizarre.

 The commentaries are very funny. It's amusing that Lex and Kathy still aren't over their ""betrayal"" by Rob. It's also enlightening to hear Amber give really nasty commentary against virtually everyone on the jury - proving that she deserves to marry a guy like Rob. They're perfect for each other.

The new material in the ""bonus footage"" varies from boring (Rob's Toothache) to mildly amusing (Tree Mail Letters), but there's nothing really great about them. Even the extended exit interviews rarely get interesting. The best bits from them are already at the end of each episode.

The seventh disc full of bonus features is also severely lacking. Most features are under 4 minutes long. One is just a montage of scenes from all seasons. Even the compilation of ""the best CBS on-air promos"" only shows 1-3 promos per season.

On the whole, this is a lousy set made passable by amusing commentaries. I'd recommend it only to the true Survivor die-hards who simply need to have every DVD related to the show.

2081813,1,B0002ERWV4,"Survivor All-Stars... This was definitely the worst of all Survivor seasons. Let me say I am the biggest Survivor fan ever, and have sat through ALL the seasons, no matter how bad it was, yes even this. I'd rather forget about this not-so-pleasant romp with past survivors.  It was completelely predictable. There was nobody to root for. The location was bland. The characters were old and tired. Everything just seemed used.

  First of all, let me say something about the abysimal casting for A.S.S. There are many people there just because their first choices turned them down. Amber, for example. In her first season, The Australian Outback, she was the most expendable castaway there. On several occasions, I forgot that she was there. She was invisible and nobody payed attention to her. There was nothing special about her at all. Then why you ask, was she cast on the show? Simple, because Colleen Haskell, from the first season, and Elisabeth Hasselback, from season two turned them down.  It is also reported that Christy Smith (Survivor The Amazon) and Neleh Dennis (Survivor Marquesas) also turned them down so Amber may have been the fifth choice. Isn't it irony when the person that the producers just had to use because they couldn't find anybody else, won the whole show? This also applies to the other terrible casting choices of Jenna Lewis, Shii Ann Huang, and Alicia Calaway. Jeff Probst and Mark Burnette have tried to cover this up by saying ""she has changed a lot and we want to see how she is now"", but they can't fool us.

  Another problem was that there was nobody to root for. You may argue that you were rooting for Rupert, but I myself was disgusted with his behavior trying to extend his fifteen minutes of fame. Could anybody be truly happy with the Rob M/ Amber final two? It really didn't matter which one won at the point. All of the interesting, likeable people were voted out early.

  The way the show panned out was completely predictable. The people who were voted out early in their previous seasons ganged up on the more experienced people, turning it into Mark Burnette's worst nightmare.

  Now about the location. It was the same location as the previous seasons, making it extremely bland, repetitive and boring. The challenges were reused also. The challenges take up way too much time. Survivor should get away from islands now.

  Another abomination was America's Tribal Council it was just a lovefest for Rupert. It was utter crap.

  The actual DVD seems to have a lot of good features, but now amount of features cam make us forget the crapfest that was Survivor All-Stars.

  Let's hope the Survivor team learned it's lesson. The game works only with strangers, and you have to keep it simple. Even though the season was filled with exciting moments, it just failed to excite me.  IT lacked warmth and charm and everything that makes Survivor good.

  Thanks for listening.",1093651200,13,2927,4.790419161676646
2081814,5,B0002ERWV4,"When you get the best of the best together to play this game you are guarenteed a great season and it delievered with player Outwititng, Outplaying and Outlasting each other. I personally was disappointed that a bunch of All-stars didn't figure out how powerful Rob and Amber was and didn't get them out. Even though i don't really consider Amber an Allstar...did anybody really notice her in the Outback. Way more entertaining people should have filed her spot. I hope they release all the seasons. I am also surprised they jumped right into Allstars. Well buy this item if you can't get enough of survivor.

How I rank the seasons:

8. Thailand (Figures their was only one allstar from here)

7. Marquesas (Nothing special)

6. Amazon (Some bright moment, not the most exciting, most exciting Jenna and Heidi taking it off)

5. Africa (Location boring, great cast though)

4. Pearl Islands (3 amazing players : Sandra, Jon, and of course Rupert)

3. Allstars (Great season, dissappointed by the result)

2. Australian Outback (So close to #1, great location, amazing cast)

Rob Mariano seems to be the key figure here, since he dominated the game by using the Robfather tactic. Unfortunately we really didn't see the real power brokers from the previous series like Richard Hatch and Rob Cesternino. At the same time Mariano wasn't really pitted against Colby or Ethan.
There are so many what if and this series answer that question.
Is it worth buying for? It depends if you like Rob Mariano and Amber. Oh yeah Rupert is here by the way and becomes the crowd favorite to win it all.",1089331200,,762,4.528985507246377
