8607705,3,B00BCJ19QM,there are lovely pictures of the assorted royal residents. but the history is not accurate. just to mention 2..Phiilipa was not 15 years older than Edward the third. she was 2 years younger. Victoria had just turned 18 when she became Queen. silly mistakes.,1502668800,,257,4.863636363636363
