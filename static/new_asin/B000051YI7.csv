7929701,4,B000051YI7,"A cute little comedy about a shy, awkward but sincere Scottish girl who forces herself to leave home in order to earn money to pay for treatment for her agoraphobic mother. This film definitely falls into the 'silly' category, but at only 78 minutes, was appreciated as light entertainment.",1410220800,,290,4.938775510204081
