8150506,4,B000JJ4FGM,"This dvd contains 4 Our Gang episodes in black-and-white: The Pooch, Fly My Kite, Hi Neighbor, and Mary Queen of Tots. Two of these episodes are featured on The Little Rascals 3-pk or 2-pk in Color, which include both color and black-and-white versions: http://www.amazon.com/Little-Rascals-2-pack-Black---White/dp/B0019UGYDC/ref=sr_1_8?ie=UTF8&qid=1329653119&sr=8-8 (highly recommended)! This dvd is still worth a few bucks just for The Pooch episode, while Mary Queen of Tots is a much older silent episode which is older with less quality.",1329609600,3,542,6.144736842105263
