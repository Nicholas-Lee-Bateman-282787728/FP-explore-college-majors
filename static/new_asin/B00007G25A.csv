1808992,5,B00007G25A,"I cannot say enough good things about this video.  It is very entertaining for everyone. This is a very well made video.  I bought it a few weeks ago and my daughter has watched it every day.  I've already recommended it to other mom friends and have bought each of my sisters-in-law a copy for their young ones.  My daughter was 16 months when she first saw the video, but I'm sure she would have enjoyed it at an earlier age.  Buy it.  You won't regret it.",1079395200,8,458,4.206896551724138
1808993,5,B00007G25A,"I purchased this DVD for my 6 month old little girl and she just loves it.  We lay her down on her playmat in front of the TV and she just stares at the TV and tries to sing.  Very cute.  I really didn't think she would enjoy it at such a young age but she really seems to like it a lot.  Which is always helpful to a new parent.
And the older kids go around the house singing the songs all the time.  It gets kind of annoying after a while but is still pretty funny.",1075852800,3,467,3.7244897959183674
1808994,5,B00007G25A,"My daughter is 15 months old and has been watching this DVD for about a month now. I hate to admit it, but she enjoys it more than most of her Baby Einstein movies! I think some of the scenes are cheesy, but the important thing is, she enjoys it. She dances around when she hears the music and she recognizes the animals and says them aloud. The music is a lot more peppy than Baby Einstein. Although I'm a big fan of Baby Einstein, especially for the learning aspect their movies, this Baby Genius DVD is more for entertainment and fun. I find it a great addition to her video collection.",1065312000,8,589,4.267857142857143

1808997,5,B00007G25A,I have a 4 month old daughter who just LOVES this video!  She will sit and watch it over & over again.  We bought her lots of videos but she seems to like this one the best.  It has great colors and the songs get her legs moving!  I can put my daughter in front of the T.V while I cook dinner & clean the house and she will not take her eyes off the set.

1809184,5,B00007G25A,"When I had my daughter, I thought I needed to get the best instructional videos out there and went for the Baby Eistein collection. The first time I put one of the videos on for my 8 months old daughter at the time, she barely paid attention. I finally decided to get the Baby Genius collection after reading a review. To my surprise, my daughter really enjoyed watching the DVD. Now, at 13 months, she still loves it. Whenever I put it on she will calm down and start rocking along to the tunes. Enjoyable for the whole family!!! I seriously recommend this collection.",1121299200,2,569,4.480769230769231

He especially loves ""Ring Around the Roses"" and ""Old MacDonald"". It is so cute to watch him pout up his lips to say ""Moo""!!

If you loved nursery rhymes as a kid, you'll love this video. It's not a cartoon, but an action filled video with real children, animals, trains, and beautiful colors. Great clarity! Highly recommended for your little music lover!!",1105401600,5,530,4.463917525773196
