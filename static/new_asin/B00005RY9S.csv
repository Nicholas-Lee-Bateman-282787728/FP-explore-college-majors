7953164,4,B00005RY9S,I would see this on the amazon list of old school kungfu movie for years but never bought it because i thought the movies were going suck. Boy was i wrong. The first is Goose Boxer and the second is Tiger Over Wall. Both movies star Phillip Ko but Tiger Over Wall also stars Hwang Jang Lee. The fight climax between these two is breath taking to say the least. TOW is the best of the 2 imo.,1518393600,,390,4.012820512820513
7953165,1,B00005RY9S,No good illegal bootleg movies with poor quality,1509753600,,48,5.125
7953166,4,B00005RY9S,Tiger Over Wall is underrated and both Philip Ko and Hwang Jang Lee are excellent (as usual). Goose Boxer is a bit silly but has it's moments as far as action.,1490486400,,159,4.161290322580645

7953168,5,B00005RY9S,Goose Boxer is a Kung fu comedy with only like three serious fights and they are very good fights. I give it a 3 on a scale of 1-5. The rest of the fights are just for laughs. Tiger over wall is 5 on a scale of 1-5. Mainly because the legendary Villian Hwang Jang Lee has plenty of screen time! His skills were unmatch on and off screen. This set is work getting because of Tiger over wall alone.,1348704000,,396,3.9625
7953169,3,B00005RY9S,"This inexpensive 2-for-1 DVD from Ground Zero's Brooklyn Zoo collection is cheap enough to justify for ""Tiger Over Wall"".  Anything else, at that point, is gravy.  The picture quality is fairly decent in both, though it's obvious they were taken from old VHS copies.  Unfortunately, ""Tiger Over Wall"" is fullscreened.

""GOOSE BOXER""
Charles Heung Wah Keung stars as a young man who cooks and sells geese.  He witnesses a Crane stylist (Hoi San Lee) murdering a couple of dudes in the forest and is able to mimic some of the man's moves to add to his own style-in-progress.  He is later kidnapped by the murderer and forced to learn and teach Crane to lure out the killer's enemies.  Of course it's only a matter of time before he's no longer needed and will be disposed of.

I wouldn't recommend this as a kung fu movie but I did enjoy it.  There are some gross and funny moments involving geese, a midget, and a sex manual believed to be a book of fighting techniques.  There is one good fight and a couple of okay ones.  Lee Hoi San's Crane style is impressive and his fights are easily the best.  2.5/5.

1978.  aka:  Shaolin's Tough Kid.

""TIGER OVER WALL""
The great Hwang Jang Lee plays the crooked constable of a small village who caters to the rich, petty foreigners.  When one of their dogs go missing and can't be found, someone has to take the fall.  A man who makes umbrellas (ellas ellas) is talked into being the scapegoat for the cops under the promise of money.  It's a lie of course, and the man's son-in-law (Phillip Ko Fei) must try and get him out of jail before it's too late.

Far from a great film, it's still pretty sweet.  There aren't a ton of fights but they are all good, leading up to a 10-minute, one-on-one finale that will not disappoint.  As dumb as this movie is, something must be right, cuz you will really hate the cops, and cheer as they receive their comeuppance.  3.5/5

7953170,5,B00005RY9S,"I bought the Goose Boxer/Tiger over Wall DVD because it was...and in the store. I was amazed to discover how great these two movies are (especially for the price)!! Goose Boxer is more of a comedy but it has many superb crane style fights. Tiger Over Wall, though, is definately the better of the two! The plot, though seeming flaccid at first, takes unexpected turns and the characters are well crafted to believability making the movie as a whole more and more intriguing. Every fight is amazing and paced well through out the movie so that the action and storyline do not overwhelm each other. The final fight between Lee and Koa is absolutely mesmerizing! Lee plays such an awesome villian you WANT to see him get his ... kicked, but he's too damn good to get beat down easily, making the fight that much more intense!
This is one of the best old school kung fu flicks I've seen in a while! The fact that I've heard so little of it before is a shame! Go out of your way to see this one if you have to.",1032652800,7,1005,4.322751322751323
7953171,5,B00005RY9S,"""Tiger over wall"" is one of the most underrated Kung-fu movies of its' era Phillip Ko is the star of this flik and man he gets down using  Mantis fist, tiger and eventually Eagles claw he gets into many fights thoughout this movie and if you are a fan of Ko's  screen work you will not be disapointed after ""Dragon on fire"" AKA ""The Dragon the hero"" this is his best as the lead player. Huang jang lee (Silver Fox) is awesome as well. The fight at the end is one of the best hand to fist combat scenes I have ever witnessed. Take a look tell me what you think.",1007596800,2,560,4.036036036036036
