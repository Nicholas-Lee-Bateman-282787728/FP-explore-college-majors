7835219,4,6303048226,"Pretty good family story, the pony was kind of secondary to the plot line, however. The plot line is a little slow for younger children.",1362009600,,136,4.48
7835220,1,6303048226,My Family & I watched only 5 minutes of this video & turned it off after hearing the Dad of the family swear in the video. All it is a half second they could remove from the video with out having to put swearing in it and ruining the whole video.,1326240000,3,246,3.843137254901961
7835221,4,6303048226,"Not much happens in this movie.  The plot is pretty simple.  In what appears to be the late 1800s (in Canada, I'm guessing) a woman with two kids marries the man responsible for the accidental death of her husband.  It's a marriage of convenience, however, with our hero living on one side of a very small cabin and everyone else on the other.  Which suits our couple fine, as she doesn't want to be married to him and he doesn't want to be married at all.  But she can't make it on her own, and he feels responsible for what happened.  So they become a family... but not really.  Not until a sick horse brings them together.

So yeah, not a lot happens.  But that's not a bad thing.  Instead of tornadoes or drought or heartless bankers scheming to foreclose, instead of evil ranchers trying to run poor ranchers off their land -- we get a tale about a family formed out of necessity and guilt growing into a real family.  A family of people who care about one another and who belong together.  A family who learns to give and take and trust.

There's something here for the whole family.  Adults can focus on the new marriage.  Kids can focus on the boy and his horse.  With neither plotline taking over the story.  It's not a story about a couple and... oh, yeah... there's this kid.  Nor is it a story about a boy who just happens to have parents.  Instead, it's a story about a family.

If you like quiet films about family, this just might be the film for you.",1310947200,4,1466,4.3003663003663
