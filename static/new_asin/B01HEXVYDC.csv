8765326,5,B01HEXVYDC,"Psychological thriller. Simple, very Intelligent. Maybe not easy to get at first sight. Sometimes intense but also very funny. And cute!
Definitely not for the mainstream.

8765330,2,B01HEXVYDC,"This is a film that seems to be more interested in creating an atmosphere than in telling a story.  Into a small town in the French countryside, a German stranger arrives.  Certainly he has a back-story, and wheedling out the strands of what that story might entail is, I suppose, what the film is ""about.""  There is an event in his past that he must find a way to come to grips with.  We witness his interactions with those around him -- his landlord, neighbors, and a possible romantic interest --  as he settles down into a disjointed day-to-day existence.  There are definite signs of darkness and foreboding, but we are given only tangential clues as to what it is that he has run away from, and he seems by turns depressed, mysterious, sexy, dangerous.  We eventually witness his attempt to address the provocations of his troubling past, albeit in an obtuse poetic manner;  but it is not clear what effect his actions will have for him in the long run.  Nor is it clear what the film's viewers are meant to take away from their viewing  experience.  We can acknowledge that the filmmakers have been able to successfully build for us a tension and a sense of un-ease.  But to what end?  Perhaps the character himself has gained some sort of self-awareness, but what is it that we have gained from this experience?",1472774400,8,1319,4.585470085470085
8765331,5,B01HEXVYDC,"Godehard Giese plays the central character Antek Liebmann in this film. Antek is a teacher in Germany on holiday who left his home without communication with his family. The setting is in a small village of rural northern France. Antek's lodging is at a house owned by an older French couple who also rents a flat for a French woman by the name of Genevive and her cute daughter played by Morgane Delamotte. The viewer eases into the story and is left with a sense of mystery as to why Antek left home.

The main language used in the film is French; some German is used when Antek's sister Ines comes to visit Antek. Antek's French is rudimentary at best, but his good looks and sex appeal far compensate for that deficiency. In fact, there are some humorous moments with language; for example, when Sbastien (the young man with whom he has sex), and Antek are conversing in one scene about what Sbastien does for a living, he replies that he delivers pastries for a firm, but Antek's understanding of the language is so minimal that he thinks Sbastien is a pastry chef--Sbastien's look is priceless--he realizes it is not worth the trouble to explain and just agrees. LOL. Familiarity with  French does help in picking up that nuance.

We learn of Antek's attraction to Sbastien while Antek is working at a used furniture store. Prior to that, we witness a sexual interest of sorts in Genevive, but once Sbastien gets in the picture, Antek's attention is focused on him. Antek, however, is preoccupied by his mysterious past in Germany which is revealed with his sister's visit. The writer uses a Gestalt approach with regard to how Antek addresses his past. It seems that Antek has had a trauma which occurred at his job, and for some reason he feels culpability to some degree.

The characters are stark contrasts of what Antek is not--the elderly couple being very simple and direct with nothing to hide like an open book, Genevive the very wholesome and caring person, her daughter the child of innocence who loves to laugh and be carefree, Ines the loving and caring sibling, and Sbastien who acts on his feelings with sincerity. Jules Herrmann did an exquisite job in making the contrasts.

One leaves this film liking the characters. Each one had a specific role in helping Antek evolve to eventually come to terms with his past. It draws you in and has its exciting moments that arouse your senses. I recommend this film with 5 stars.",1471824000,7,2443,4.685314685314685
