Una vez mas  Harry Christophers y los integrantes del coro
The Sixteen nos dan un regalo al espritu, con esa msica
que eleva al cielo.
Algo muy importante tambin a recalcar es que trae subtitulos
en espaol. Esta es una grave falta que tienen las otras
producciones de The Sixteen.
Altamente recomendado.

5040113,5,B006ZBJJI2,"The DVD, God's Composer, celebrating the 400th anniversary of the death of Tomas Luis Victoria, is a tour de force containing breathtaking cinematography of places significant in the life of Victoria, illuminating narrative (citing details little known of Victoria's life), and exquisite singing. Harry Christophers (no neophyte to the music of Victoria) makes the radical statement that (in his opinion), Victoria was the GREATEST Renaissance composer (INCLUDING Palestrina!). Christophers expends much effort to get this point across (both musically and in his narrative).
  As beautiful as Palestrina's music was, Christophers explains, there was a certain ""restraint"" (in comparison to Victoria's) in terms of the emotional ""spectrum"" (or palate, if you prefer) that each composer employed. ""There is much more emotion in the music of Victoria,"" Christophers maintains. From the depths of Hell to the heights of Heaven, we are taken on an emotional ""roller-coaster ride"" that delights and (at times) terrifies! Of course, one needs to accept this approach to Victoria's music to interpret it ""correctly,"" according to Christophers. Too many ensembles luxuriate in the ""pretty"" chords, the lovely arching lines (typical of the melodies of Palestrina), rather than sing the text.
  Victoria was nothing if not a student of Scripture, and in fact, was a contemporary of the Saint/Mystic, Teresa of Avila. It is speculated (not without grounds, in my opinion), that it is likely that they knew each other, and may have been colleagues. So devout was Victoria, that he became a Priest, and (even more startling), devoted the last years of his life to being an ""Enclosed Novicemaster."" This meant that he was essentially a ""hermit"" during his final years, devoting himself to prayer, spiritual direction (of the novices that were in his care), and composition (although no public performances of his music were ever again given, except during Mass at this one Monastery). Droves would flock to the Monastery where he was ""enclosed,"" to hear Mass, and also to once again hear his music performed (keep in mind - there were no recordings for the people to listen to - only live performances).
  Christophers considers Victoria's spirituality to be an integral aspect of his music. He goes so far as to state that to fail to properly appreciate the role of spirituality in the music of Victoria is to miss the point of his music entirely. Like Teresa of Avila, Victoria too, was a kind-of Mystic (though in his case, a Mystic/Composer in contrast to Teresa's, Mystic/Writer). It is even speculated that there may have been a kind-of spiritual ""mentoring"" by Teresa of the devout composer.
  The Sixteen outdo themselves on this DVD in terms of sheer beauty of tone, and expansiveness of feeling/expression, performing (in their entirety) several works of Victoria, including, ""Super Flumina Babylonis"" (for choir), as well as an arrangement of ""O Quam Gloriosum"" for soprano and lute (heartrenderingly performed by Grace Davidson). This piece alone, is worth the price of the DVD, as it's sheer beauty (literally) took my breath away!

  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!",1351468800,16,3154,5.275449101796407

8506861,4,B006ZBJJI2,interesting history of sacred music with shots of the various settings  or locations connected with the music....however this is not just a straight concert but narratives of the backgrounds of the songs along with choral performances,1425168000,3,234,5.5
8506862,5,B006ZBJJI2,"The first time that I listened to this work, my soul soared.  Victoria is easily one of the greatest and most overlooked composers.
He brings joy and light to Christianity as compared to the heaviness of many of his contemporaries in many of the arts.  I bought extra copies for friends.  Two of them are seriously ill.  The music brought them joy and as well as peace.",1413676800,5,369,4.462686567164179
8506863,5,B006ZBJJI2,The Sixteen perform Victoria beautifully.  The documentary presents an inspiring view of the composer's life.  It is both lovely to listen to and lovely to view.,1404691200,2,161,5.153846153846154
8506864,5,B006ZBJJI2,"To me, Victoria is is the best composer of baroque sacred choral music.  The Christophers/sixteen provide a compelling interpretation.  This stuff is powerful.",1396828800,,159,5.869565217391305
8506865,5,B006ZBJJI2,It is as if I were in heaven and heard the angels sing. Such beautiful music. The harmony of these singers is outstanding. I only wish that the narrative had not been stated during the singing.,1396396800,,193,4.388888888888889
8506866,3,B006ZBJJI2,"Gorgeous music and a well-made documentary.  However, one must be forewarned it IS a documentary, not a choral concert per se.  You will not hear the choir begin and end so much as a single piece of music without the voice-over narrator talking, describing how wonderful it is.  I do wish I could get the music without the commentary.",1394150400,15,334,4.627118644067797
8506867,5,B006ZBJJI2,"I've set about collecting all the ""Sacred Music"" DVDs. The performances by Harry Christophers and The Sixteen are superb, the sound quality is wonderful, and the commentary helps to put the music and the performing style in historical and musical context. This is a DVD to be treasured and enjoyed repeatedly.",1361232000,8,309,5.078431372549019
