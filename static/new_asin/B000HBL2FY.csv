8137969,5,B000HBL2FY,"I viewed this program on its original air date and I have never forgotten it. The rememberances and comments were the most heartfelt and sincere I have ever heard.  I have a very dear friend who is coming to the end of his life and in preparation of a eulogy, I have thought of this broadcast many times. I have recently placed an order for the DVD as I must watch this program again.  George Plimpton must have been quite a man to have so many dear friends.  There will never be another show to equal the quality of Charlie Rose.  William Bradley",1221609600,,547,4.281553398058253
8137970,5,B000HBL2FY,"Very often the most outstanding Charlie Rose shows are memorial shows done on the day or the day after a distinguished person has died. This memorial show is for George Plimpton, founder and long- time editor of the Paris Review, writer of over twenty books, including his most well known 'Paper Lion', and according to all accounts here, wonderfully generous friend and life- loving person. Editors Lewis Lapham, Robert Silvers, David Remnick talk about Plimpton as editor and writer. They mention his remarkable spirit of adventure, a spirit which led him to realize his Walter Mitty fantasies and box with Archie Moore, quarterback for the Detroit Lions. They talk about his helpfulness to young writers, his talent as raconteur. In the second segment other friends, including the restaranteur Elaine Kaufman whose place he was a fixture at tell more stories which illustrate his sense of fun and spirit of generosity.
As with many Charlie Rose shows this one gave me a truer idea of a public figure who I had known something of and vaguely misunderstood.
An outstanding tribute to a remarkable person.",1204416000,,1105,5.043715846994536
