8517533,5,B007IIPUT8,Good information and great technique. Easy to understand and I like the emphasis put on body mechanics for the practitioner.,1494633600,,124,5.25
8517534,2,B007IIPUT8,It was just ok. Wish it was just the instruction piece and it's very dragged out.,1481760000,,81,4.125
8517535,5,B007IIPUT8,"Very informative DVDs. I love that you can watch by body region, and that it goes pretty much step by step. I would highly recommend watching the Essential DVD FIRST since it goes a little more in depth on the different techniques and body mechanics. Original shows how to do an entire session, with minimal instruction. Will definitely incorporate into my massage sessions from now on!",1430524800,,386,4.863636363636363

8517538,5,B007IIPUT8,Val does an excellent job explaining and showing video of each technique and body mechanics.  This is a must purchase to save your hands and enhance your practice with a new and exciting technique.  It is professionally done and has great videography.  Val is a wealth of knowledge and skill.  I fully intend to add this to my practice.,1420156800,2,336,4.6440677966101696
8517539,3,B007IIPUT8,"Watch the Essentials first to get a hang of the basic moves. Be forewarned that the majority of the draping is not for spa work, and the essentials disc has some ""spa edit"" moves. Also, she doesn't use bolsters so the moves feel very different to me as a therapist and are limited when my client requires bolstering under the legs, hips, or ankles. There are some good moves here, but mostly the same 3 or 4 moves repeated with students, alone, with narration, and without. The rest are breathing and energy exercises. I was a bit disappointed.",1417305600,7,544,4.561224489795919
8517540,5,B007IIPUT8,"I found this DVD to be very informative, and very pleasing to watch, such graceful movements, which I am now incorporating into my own therapy practice.",1377302400,4,152,4.884615384615385
