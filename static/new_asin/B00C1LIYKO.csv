5685933,5,B00C1LIYKO,"As 80 years olds, my wife and I think most of the Disney series are very adolescent, featuring untalented adolescents who are not funny, wiggling but not dancing and singing too loud non-music.. But Good Luck Charlie hit the jackpot on all the full age range cast. They are all multitalented comedic actors - even little Charlie (Mia Telerico?) This DVD features many good episodes, has good sound and is packaged well. We enjoyed it immensely and recommend it highly.  G. Turner",1377993600,7,479,4.841463414634147
