I enjoyed the video and found it forthcoming. A great message. It doesnt (unlike some other reviews may say) mean that you can not pursue educational goals, simply, to keep a balance and keep things in perspective to put God first. Doing so will bring the most happiness to ones life.",1534118400,,319,4.406779661016949

8763692,1,B01GWC0DRO,"Watching the Watchtowers Pursue Goals That Honor God  made me feel like that guy in Get Out! who goes through an experience with people who have some sort of agenda- but he was not sure what it is. When he realizes at last he is being played in an elaborately staged event designed to suck away his brain and his life he finds he must simply get out!

If rating this as a propaganda piece, the film easily deserves five stars. But since this 2007 docudrama is intended as a genuine guide to honor God it cannot avoid the negative judgement of the lowest possible rating. It earns a single starwith strong warnings attached.

The anonymous writers of Pursue Goals That Honor God (PGTHG) chose the character Timothy to build their case that godly men leap without looking to reach goals that honor God.  (Sorry ladies, the film gives us short shrift but at the end learn our goal may be to cook favorite meals for godly men.)

The story is derived loosely from the New Testament1st and 2nd Timothy and references from the Book of Act. But this biblical base is too small to support the Watchtower spin it has to support. (Open your Bibles please)

And so the time is 67 C.E. in Ephesus. We see a man who turns out to be Timothy as he prepares to attend dinner a friends home. Next we meet a young fellow (entirely fictitious), Julius, torn by his desire for worldly pursuits or his desire to pursue goals that honor God (which he believes means following the examples of Christian heroes Paul and Timothy).And there these two meet: Julius and Timothy. And this is where the writers stack the plot to their end.

Timothy witnesses the poignant vulnerability of Julius in uncomfortable conversation with friends who want him to hang out with them. Julius refuses their pressure to join them. Yet the exchange casts Julius in doubt as to whether he is authentic at all in his desires to be a good Christian boy. So Timothy-the-protge-of-Paul draws the kid out in a scene of smooth spiritual seduction.  Why, Timothy had also faced these temptations! He too rejected higher education so that he could honor God! The bible-laced phrases might make the mind slide toward Timothys picture of a Sugar Daddy in the sky who watched over those who Pursue Goals that Honor God. Events pulled from the book of Acts are meant to validate the Watchtower veracity  and in general and let us suspend our critical thinkingits all biblical, right?

Wrong. At this point it is good to remember that although the writers have pulled Timothy from scriptures, they have inflected the elements within their story that have to do with learning. The view that the Bible explicitly rejects higher education or that godly people should reject it is a sly fiction.

Working for your living figured high in that world as now. Paul had acid scoldingsmany in factin his writings where he warned slackers and those who abandoned their aged mothers and grandmas to shape up. (Timothy?)Nevertheless, the the film plays up their version of Timothy as the bell wether to follow if you would honor god. And we wait to hear any reference to how he supports himself or how others around him ought to make a living .

The writers of PGTHG pretend there is no problem finding material support then or now. They ignore Pauls strident complaints about lazy Christians. And it isn't only his comments on the unruly Cretans. He rails at the Thessaloniansif you don't work, you don't eat and his constant cry of l paid for it myself! should also give rise to questions of employment.  It seems to me that Paul would have happily co-signed on a college loan if a lively fellow had asked him. No where can l find Paul roundly condemning higher education. Yet the film presents this ban on learning as a Gospel truth.  And so the notion Watchtower pushes the notion that pursuing higher education means you do not honor God.

 For a moment lets consider employment 2000 years later. In this country if you do not find some sort of higher education it is difficult to have a good job. Low paid employment makes the problem of serving God by door-knocking a considerable challenge. It is hard to avoid the line at your local DHS office for food relief if you follow the directions of this film.

 But returning to the past and the conversation between Overcomer Timothy and the young Julius we hear of Shallow Christian Jonathan, Timothys old boyhood friend. In Jonathan the Watchtower writers want us to see Utter Folly,  The Jonathan character is the guy swinging on that broad gate that leads to destruction who just doesnt get it.  A Christian also, Jonathan who loves his friend Timothy is parting ways because? Jonathan has a girlfriend, he is going to college , he plans to go into business afterward.  Timothy on the other hand is getting ready to tell his Gentile dad that he is going to serve god fully, not go into the family business, not go to college. What is he going to live on? No one says. But  the subtext is clear and the narrow gate is narrower than we thought.  Jonathans interest in marriage , education, business means he is does not honor God. We are given to understand these are hazards that run contrary to goals that honor God. But now , Timothy....

 As the Watchtower is ready to slip this supposed seamless garment of Truth over our heads it gets snagged because Pauls thorny remarks at 2 Thessalonians get in the way. How the writers ignore these passages for this film is troubling. An example is this tough little homily where Paul warns against idleness. 2 Thes, 3:7,8,12 We were not idle when we were with you, nor did we eat anyones food without paying for it. On the contrary we worked night and day laboring and toiling so we would not be a burden to any of you...Such people (those who were idle)we command and urge in the Lord Jesus Christ to settle down and earn the bread they eat. And more plaintively he writes at 1 Tim. 4:4,8: but if a widow has children or grandchildren, these should learn first of all to put their religion into practice by caring for their own family and so repaying their parents and grandparents, for this is pleasing to God. ...And if anyone does not provide for his relatives and especially for his immediate family, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever.

I simply reject this films dishonest portrayal that to evangelize without regard for family financial support is biblical. It does not match up with Pauls complaints, rants and commands that a Christian must take care of himself and his family or not be counted a Christian!

In light of all this might we be forgiven for wondering  why higher education is not rather encouraged in this film? Might a job higher than tentmaker provide better for families with less physical burden and time demands ? (Might it not have saved your eyesight, Paul, from nighttime sewing?) But the Watchtower has not, does not, will not encourage higher education. Why?

But back to our story.  ( spoiler alert) We discover Jonathan was quite successful in a worldly wayhad quite a few childrenyoung Julius among them! During which time PHTHG writers have the road of financial success darken when Jonathan gets involved with the rich Philetus. But once Jonathan ends his association with this bonafide NT villain, and puts spiritual things first, (starts dressing down we see) he is happier. And the children arenetter off too, says the wife. And not only this but young Julius decided to follow Timothys example instead of his dads!

The Watchtower writers now have saved Jonathan and intend this facile conclusion to prove their point. But it is good to stop and think before you slide past the biggest dropped stitch in this patch-together story. The film has failed miserably to convince us Jonathans early actions marriage, schooling, business actually impaired his ultimate spiritual outcome.  If there is a connection what was it? He may have ratcheted down his business ties to hang out with the fam but where is the case for living and providing for family being things that inherently dishonor God?And it is hard not to wonder how much better his higher ed and business savvy has helped the widows and orphans not to mention his own wife and kids.

Life is not easy. In youthful inexperience and ardor we can end up following footsteps never made for us. This story of the sacrificing saint vs. the dinner sinner doesnt hold together. The writers of Pursue Goals That Honor God reside at Watchtower headquarters and are largely supported by the earnings of hardworking folks who were discouraged from pursuing higher education. As old age and infirmity creeps up on those hundreds of thousands l wonder why the Corporation  still discourages college? Why not let people provide better for their families? The film does not engage on these points.

To end lets return to the opening scene. Remember where the narrators voice alludes to the scripture money serves as a protection?Thats when we see Timothys carefree expression as he sweeps coins into his purse on his way to the dinner.  He holds the coins lightly in his palm. But who earned that money? In the end it is the openly troubled face of Jonathan that is more compelling --and realto me. Oddly their fictional Jonathan is more believable than the not-real real Timothy they present. Because bewildered by it all the Jonathans struggle to be good men too, Are they really bad Christians if they earn enough unrighteous riches to feed Timothys momma and grandma while he stands in line for soup?

Not a good thing to watch.
