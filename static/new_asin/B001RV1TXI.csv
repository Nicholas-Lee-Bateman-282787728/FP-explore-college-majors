8338947,5,B001RV1TXI,"Another great Sci-Fi TV Series that should be in every collection.  This is a definitive Must Have.  In this series .  Some people compare this to the previous Dark Shadows TV series.  I was never a fan of Dark Shadows.  This was so much better, in my humble opinion.  Humble, Yeah Right!!  But, really, these were good continuous storylines and I loved the love-interest drama that went on.  I HATED the Ending of the series.  But, like most series ending, something Finate has to happen.  You just don't want it to.  Not long ago, my sister said, You know, I saw the actor on TV (Geraint Wyn Davies) recently and hes gotten fat!!  Well, thats what Movies and TV Series were made for, so we can remember when they were HOT!!!  We all Get Older, Fortunately, Captured Images Dont, Much Like Vampires.  Ill Always Remember Nick as a Hot Vampire Cop, Riding in the Trunk of His Car, to Avoid the Sun.  More then a Few Times, He Didnt Make it Quite Home, Before the Sun Rose.  I Highly Recommend this Series and a Beautiful Set.  Thank you for Reading My Review.",1483488000,,1059,4.432291666666667

8338949,5,B001RV1TXI,"I absolutely loved this show when it first aired back in '92 I was heartbroken that it only lasted 3 seasons, there was so much room to advance this story especially when Vachon, Urs, and Screed were introduced in the 3rd season those three had so much potential to make a great show even better, I loved those characters.  This wasn't a True Blood or Vampire Diaries but it stood on its own as a great vampire cop show.  Two or Three times a year I break out all three seasons and have a Forever Knight Week Festival for me and my other friends who were fanatics of this show. But, the only episode I cannot watch is the very last one ""Last Knight"",  I get depressed for days after watching my hero die.  I'm such a Sap!",1464220800,2,721,4.202898550724638

8338952,5,B001RV1TXI,"I love gothic drama - especially when it contains a little humor. I thought nothing would be as good as the original Dark Shadows(dating myself ) - I was one of those kids who ran all the way home to watch it. I got hooked on this series as an adult, and was grateful it was available. Now, I can watch at my leisure.  Thanks.  M. E. Evans",1357171200,2,339,3.9705882352941178
8338953,4,B001RV1TXI,Here is another series that I really liked I think this series could have gone on several more seasons; I seem to remember more episodes than what are included here; but perhaps they were just episodes I imagined (made up myself in wishful thinking).  All in all a good series I wish it had gone on longer.,1327795200,2,306,4.368421052631579
8338954,5,B001RV1TXI,I was so excited to find this as I'd heard they weren't doing seasons 2 and 3 on DVD due to low sales of season 1.  I was surprised when I saw this and had to get it.  I loved the show and so did my girlfriend.  Now we can watch it anytime we want.,1286928000,11,248,3.4727272727272727
8338955,5,B001RV1TXI,Got this entire series and watched all 70 episodes in like 2 weeks!  It is so good I didn't want it to end!  Highly recommend this for all vampire lovers!,1265241600,8,154,4.1
