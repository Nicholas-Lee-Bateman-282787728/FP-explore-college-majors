5079339,5,B007EAFTXW,Another wonderful UK series. Utterly captivating in every way it is too bad ITV cancelled it after the 3rd series. I just wish the US companies Amazon & all the others could get together to show these in a more timely manner.,1425513600,,225,4.380952380952381
5079340,5,B007EAFTXW,"Love this show! But as an American I am sometimes bewildered at what is permitted in a British courtroom. Is the defendant allowed to talk to the jury? Allowed to lie in the box, then apologize to the barrister? But then, I had to chuckle when one of the pupils is admonished by the judge: ""This isn't America, we don't walk and talk at the same time."" I guess lawyers have to stand in one place. The best reasons for watching, however, are Clive, Martha, and Billie. Such well drawn characters and fine acting. And is this not the best dialogue ever- when Martha tells Clive she's pregnant and he's says ""F*** me, Martha!"" And she replies ""I did."" Ha!
Makes me happy I invested in a region 2 DVD player. Awaiting Season 3.",1420848000,,723,4.402985074626866

5079344,5,B007EAFTXW,The BBC series of Silk is very good!  The cast is excellent and the script is even better.  Will there be a Series 3 and 4?  Thank you.,1388448000,2,135,3.75
5079345,4,B007EAFTXW,"I became a quick fan of the BBC series 'Silk' season one shown on the US PBS. The series takes us into the courtrooms of the UK, quite unlike ours in the US. I was quite excited to receive 'Silk' Season 2 from Amazon UK.

Maxine Peake plays QC Martha Costello and Rupert Penry-Jones plays Clive Reader, the two very competitive barristers in their chambers. These two actors are the epitome of what makes a good series great. Martha has just taken silk, which means she has graduated to Queen's Counsel and gets to wear a better wig and robe. Martha is an idealist and will do what it rakes to make justice reign. In this series she shows a great deal of emotion, learns that she can't always stay on the tried and true track, but she also brings out the best in everyone. Clive did not receive his silk because he had an affair with one of his 'pupils', a student. Billy played by Neil Stuke, is the clerk of the chambers, and we can see that he and Martha are professionals, but have great affection for each other. Billy tolerates Clive because he can bring in a great deal of money to their chambers. But Billy does not suffer fools gladly.

Silk takes place in the chambers and courtroom. Very exciting cases , and we get to meet a new barrister, Caroline Warwick, played by Frances Barber. She very much wants to be part of their chambers, and takes us through several courtroom surprises. Martha has someone to talk to and there is the introduction of a new pupil who is supposed to be Clives but becomes more helpful to Martha. Billy has some serious issues to attend to, and unrest is surrounding the gates.

'Silk' series two is a great addition. I think I liked it more than season one. The characters are known and become more real. We learn a little more about their private life. Martha is still single, and Clive seems to have a new lady love. Looking forward to season three.

Highly Recommended. prisrob 10-05-13",1380931200,12,1929,4.456090651558074
5079346,5,B007EAFTXW,"Season 1 has just been shown on PBS in America.  A strong, courtroom drama, Silk is similar in some ways to Kavanagh Q.C.--the John Thaw vehicle.  It shows the inner workings of a firm of London barristers.  They are identified by their location (River Court, in Kavanagh, Shoe Lane in Silk) and their sets (American 'firms') include regular barristers and those who have been made Queen's Counsels, the wearers of silk.  The cases are secured from solicitors and the crucial go-betweens within the sets/firms are the clerks, particularly the head clerk.  In Kavanagh this individual is a canny, blue-collar individual; in Silk the head clerk strays to (and over) the ethical edge, a person who would be an avenging angel for the set/firm but who sometimes exhibits characteristics that are more demonic.

Silk concerns a woman aspiring to QC status in series 1, achieving it, and then utilizing it in series 2.  Her counterpart is a handsome male with a proclivity for sleeping with colleagues, pupils, solicitors, et al.  He was turned down for silk.  Between them is the conspiring, unctuous, borderline-evil head clerk.  The cases/plot arcs continue across the second series and end in a powerful crescendo in episode six.

The episodes are just under an hour in length; the performances are strong, the writing confident and pointed.  Series 2 brings some positive additions to the cast in the form of a powerful prosecutorial woman QC, who wishes to join the Shoe Lane set, and a hyper-sexual solicitor, played by the exceptional Indira Varma.  Series 2 also introduces the major London mob solicitor, one 'Micky Joy', a superb character who is nearly a match for the set/firm's chief clerk, 'Billy Lamb'.  The writers obviously realize the importance of tag names.

Highly recommended.  Equally recommended: the purchase of an all-region DVD player, so that you have the option of purchasing from both Amazon in the U.S. and Amazon in the U.K.",1380585600,23,1950,5.02803738317757

Now I'm all out of the thousand words I just feverishly poured out, but to try to grasp it again, there is a great wave of emotion that just roars onto the screen here. I love the way that Martha makes people turn with new found sympathy and caring towards the most unlovable characters. And Mr. Clive Reader is just a true Knight! The way he stands up for Lizzie just won me over completely and now he's in hot water, all for standing up for her when nobody else would. And poor Senior Clark is facing possible Cancer!-I wish these Barristers would turn towards him once in awhile and ask after his well being, after all, he may be the Master Puppeteer but he needs love too. This is the most engaging and just truly superb drama I have seen since Wallander, with Sir Kenneth Branaugh. Silk, is Outstanding! And not to be missed.
