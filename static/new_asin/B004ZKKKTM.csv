4510227,1,B004ZKKKTM,"I am so disappointed with this movie. It definitely did not live up to the first movie which was good. This movie has some good actors, but the acting was still horrible. The cinematography looks like a video from the average Joe on YouTube. The flashbacks of the movie were confusing with the present and annoying. I only watch the whole thing because I paid for it and didn't want my money to go to waste. I should ask for a refund. Right from the beginning of the movie it seems like it's going to be a low budget horrible movie. And it was! Do kids in a horror movie ever work out? The first movie was good which I give it 4 out of 5. I give this movie a 1 out of 5 and I am big on movies by the way. I don't understand how this movie could drop the ball so huge. If a third installment is in the works please scrap away the second and stick with worked in the first movie. And the plot was so redundant of other horror movies. It's like a Saw movie gone horrible. I would say good job if this was a student project by a film major. But I wouldn't even recommend watching this on TV for free.",1315008000,,1096,3.9863636363636363
4510228,1,B004ZKKKTM,"I have not seen the first movie and it might of helped as this one made constant references to it. Fortunately they tossed in a couple of flashbacks and slasher films are not hard to figure out. Brenden and Darryl are close friends who both have super wives who can't act. Brenden is troubled by nightmares which he believes are portent. In one night Darryl, Brenden's wife and niece are missing and Darry's wife shows up at Breden's place and she seems to be putting the moves on him...

The movie soon turns into a torture film as everyone becomes a prisoner of the experimenting doctor, although it is not graphic. For instance, we see a cutting device move toward a finger, then we see a severed finger (without blood). The acting, dialouge, and plot were all fairly bad with few bright spots. The camera angels were awkward and I noticed it cut off the tops of heads too many times at the beginning of the movie. This is just amateur camera and directing mistakes. No real horror. Nothing to see here folks, just keep moving on.

No F-bombs, no sex, no nudity.",1313884800,6,1065,4.512953367875648
4510229,2,B004ZKKKTM,"i just happened to be flipping through channels and stopped on BET and noticed MARQUES HOUSTON and OMARION in a movie together, ONCE AGAIN.  i didn't realized that i was watching THE SEQUEL to SOMEBODY HELP ME, PART 1.  i could have sworn the first was titled, CABIN IN THE WOODS, but anyways.  i watched a good 45 min of this movie, and the ACTING was more frightening than the storyline.  it was like a VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY BAD version of HOSTEL.  i would definitely say that the first is better.  this was so low budget.",1311724800,2,525,4.360824742268041

4510285,1,B004ZKKKTM,"This has to be worse than the worst movie ever made, if that is possible.  I can't believe people wasted money to make this piece of garbage. Poor acting, poor plot and poorly thought out.",1347062400,,188,4.371428571428571

4510287,4,B004ZKKKTM,I actually liked the film. Idk if it's because I'm an Omarion and Malika fan  but it was better than expected.,1328486400,,110,4.238095238095238
4510288,1,B004ZKKKTM,"you're an a-hole and a d--k.  this movie SUCKS!! as did the first one.  this movie takes place a year or so after the original.  brenden and darryl have both gotten married and moved on, but brenden is still having nightmares.  his wife, neice, and darryl disappear one night and its up to him and darryls wife to save them.  the movie started good, but the plot twist at the end is ignorant.  IGNORANT!!! take the terribleness of the first one and multiply 3x, and you got this!!",1317859200,,480,4.3977272727272725
4510289,2,B004ZKKKTM,well i gave it 2 stars cuz i actually finished watching it....it wasn't super horrible but it was weak...definitely not as good as the first one....the 2 lead guys in it were fine but the other actors were not so strong.....the acting was a bit remedial at times.....and the writing was a bit off.....sometimes it just didn't fit the scene..many awkward lines.....as for the gore...well not so much but for the low budget they had they made it work.......i did appreciate the twist at the end but due to the weakness of the movie it didn't come off that strong........had potential but just didn't get there....i would say wait & stream it for free,1315612800,,648,4.692982456140351
