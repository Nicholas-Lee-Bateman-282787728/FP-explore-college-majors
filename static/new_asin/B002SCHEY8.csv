8379319,3,B002SCHEY8,Sorry I just don't care for documentaries. Too much opinion involved however this is a good one I am sure.,1510444800,2,106,4.35
8379320,3,B002SCHEY8,"I think the documentary is well done overall; however, I found one huge glaring mistake and I am by no means a historian. But in episode one, he places Register Rock in Wyoming. Its absolutely not in Wyoming; its in American Falls, Idaho. Ive been there and touched it with my own hands.

This makes me wonder what else the documentary got wrong. Take the info in here with a grain of salt.",1510358400,2,390,4.342465753424658
