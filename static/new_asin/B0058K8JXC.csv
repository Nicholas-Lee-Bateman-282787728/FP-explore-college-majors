8461670,5,B0058K8JXC,"I saw this production when it was aired on television for the second time in 1960.  That broadcast was in color!  This DVD is the black & white version that was originally aired in 1954!  Television programs in those days were recorded on kinescopes, which was a method of recording a program from a television monitor.  The resulting recording was a much poorer rendering of a program than we have become accustomed to today!  All that said, this DVD is quite good!  The video quality is not as sharp as one would like, but it is nevertheless quite ""watchable""!  The audio is much better and, for me, that was the important thing!  To hear Judith Anderson and  Maurice Evans speak the lines of the play was a treat I thoroughly enjoyed.  Anderson is the best ""Lady Macbeth"" that I have personally seen(others being Jeanette Nolan and Judi Dench)!  She was born to play the role---her performance of the ""Out damned spot . . . "" scene moved me greatly!  Despite her wickedness, Anderson manages to evoke sympathy for a woman tortured by her deeds.  Maurice Evans gives an equally fine performance as the tragic protagonist!

Anyone who loves Shakespeare---and this play---and can make some allowances for the technical limitations, will not be disappointed!  I would recommend it to anyone meeting the aforementioned criteria!!!

I would like to mention the vendor that I  bought the DVD from!  It was Video dimensions!  I was amazed at how promptly my order was processed and delivered!  I ordered it on a Monday and received it the following Friday!!!  It arrived ""as advertised""!  I will certainly buy from this vendor in the future, whenever possible!",1434067200,,1655,4.835714285714285
8461671,5,B0058K8JXC,"I loved this production.  One gets the felling that the director and actors understood the play, something I do not always experience in a Shakespeare production.  I was prepared for the technical limitations of the picture and they did not bother me, but anybody thinking of buying this should be aware that it comes in fuzzy old black and white.  However, I bought it for Shakespeare, just to hear those lines performed and I was not disappointed.",1433289600,,449,4.805194805194805
8461672,5,B0058K8JXC,I am grateful that this 1954 performance is available. Where is the 1960 Technicolor version? Why has that never been made available? Judith Anderson is simply amazing. I saw her as the Nurse in Medea in 1982. Totally memorable.,1418428800,3,228,4.871794871794871
8461673,5,B0058K8JXC,"After decades of waiting for the Dame Judith Anderson- Maurice Evans MacBeth to appear on DVD, here it is. It is the only version of Shakespeare's Scottish tragedy that lends itself to use in the classroom for senior English teachers. Judith Anderson is the coldest, cruelest Lady MacBeth ever, & doesn't have the demure seductress about her to make her sympathetic.  This is a chilling MacBeth without the gratuitous violence of the Polanski version. Students will correctly remember MacBeth after seeing this made-for-tv masterpiece.",1402099200,6,535,5.369047619047619
8461674,4,B0058K8JXC,"This is unfortunately in Black and White, while the original was broadcast in color. Maurice Evans (yes, of Ape fame), is a fabulous Macbeth and Judith Anderson is a forceful Lady Macbeth. The production values are of their time, but unlike a Sean Connery Macbeth (which appears in a collection of movies and is very hard to watch) the drama comes across quite well.",1397779200,2,366,4.734375
8461675,5,B0058K8JXC,"Maurice Evans and Judith Anderson in Shakespeare?! How could it be bad?  It's simply marvelous and a great time capsule of a theatrical style and period that has just about disappeared.

Keanu Reeves playing Shakespeare? Please.  These actors were trained in the early part of the 20th century and you can hear every, single word and understand everything they are saying.  Great acting and it's just fun, fun. fun.  And J. Pat O
Malley is one of the best Porters I've seen.

This is a must see from 1954.  Yea, baby. Old School. Vintage and whatever  hipster hyperboles you want to use - it rocketh!",1392681600,5,600,4.647619047619048
8461676,5,B0058K8JXC,"PRODUCT IS AS ADVERTISED. GREAT FOR OUR FAMILY INTERTAINMENT. I NEVER THOUGHT I  WOULD BUY A VHS AGAIN, BUT I AM GLAD THAT I DID.",1377043200,,129,4.16
8461677,4,B0058K8JXC,"Honestly, most of my four-star rating is based simply on gratitude that somebody has finally made the Maurice Evans/Judith Anderson ""Macbeth"" available at all, and the lack of a fifth star just reflects the undeniably poor technical quality of both the original production and the available print.  But the Evans/Anderson interpretation shaped a whole American generation's impressions of the play (albeit more through their filmed remake, which remains unavailable, than through this earlier live production).  For years, there's been no way for most people to experience the most famous Macbeth of its time.  So whatever the flaws, many thanks are due to Video Dimensions for this release.

There is tremendous historical value in this production--particularly to academics, drama historians, and students & devotees of Shakespeare.  On that level, there's no question that this release is a good thing.  But the DVD can & should be judged on several other levels:

The information on the cover tells us that this version has been restored from existing fragments of kinescopes.  The implication is that there were multiple kinescoped copies (or parts of them) to work from, and the restorers took the best elements from each.  If that's so, it would explain moments when the image quality and sound seem to abruptly change.  There are also many, many moments when several frames are dropped due to bad splices, sometimes simply cutting out a few words, other times a few lines.  As you'd expect, there are more of these moments towards the beginning, where the original film reels would have been more prone to damage from, say, poor loading or damaged projectors.  If you can put up with those glitches for the first ten minutes or so, they largely (not entirely) disappear.  However, beyond this basic recreation of the production, the restoration is an extremely limited one.  There seems to have been no sound work done--the soundtrack pops and crackles throughout--and even in the more or less undamaged parts of the film there are too many scratches and burns to count.  Now, a full restoration would have meant frame-by-frame corrections of these elements, which frankly in this case might take years, so it's understandable that a smaller company, lacking the resources for such a job, might have decided to simply release it once it was in viewable condition.  So this isn't a criticism, just an observation:  this is not a clean film in terms of sound and picture.  If you are not willing to put up with this kind of flaw, watch something else.

In terms of production values, it's about what you'd expect from any live television production in the 1950s.  That format placed severe restrictions on performers, directors, set designers, and of course script editors.  It feels cramped and studio-bound, because it was.  Don't expect much in those terms--if you want gorgeous sweeping shots of bleak moors, the Polanski production is a good place to start.  That said, there is some effort at creative blocking and cinematography where it was feasible.  There are also some outright gaffes (such as when the shadow of the boom mic looms menacingly on the wall for a moment before pulling back as if hoping it hadn't been spotted), but that sort of thing was just one of the perils of live television drama, largely forgotten these days.

The overall concept is very straightforward--indeed, one of the benefits of ""Macbeth"" is that it lends itself easily to abridgement and simplification, and while you get a lesser play for that, at least you still get a coherent one.  There are few attempts at interesting or challenging new interpretations here; this is ""Macbeth"" for a general audience.  However, there are glimpses here and there.  Macbeth's second visit to the witches is shown here, a la the ghosts in ""Richard III"", as a dream (the lines of the various visions being given to the witches themselves), which saved a difficult and time-consuming set redress (this was live, remember) and also could lead us to question Macbeth's state of mind.  Lady Macduff's cousin seems more obviously to be nursing a suppressed love for her than is often displayed; this serves to make a minor character much more interesting even if it can't lead anywhere.  Macbeth is seen to hide around a corner when Duncan's sons discuss their plans to flee after his murder, and while such eavesdropping doesn't really affect the production as a whole, it gives us an interesting glimpse into Macbeth's character.  Anderson, looking like a bird of prey, is excellent (and somewhat creepy) throughout.

And let's not forget the voices.  Judith Anderson and Maurice Evans had two of the best voices in the business, she gravelly and malicious, and he sounding a bit like Richard Kiley.  And if their styles, forged in and still influenced by the Barrymore era, seem a bit on the declamatory side (especially to an audience now accustomed to the more naturalistic style that Olivier was at that point popularizing), they are still perfectly clear and very satisfying to listen to--Shakespeare as read by actors who knew what every line meant, and who really, really knew how to speak.  For that reason alone, I'd be thankful to Video Dimensions for this release.  And I hope they might be inspired to dig up more such treasures--the Evans ""Hamlet"", ""Tempest"", and many others are out there waiting to be rediscovered, as are scores of other ""lost"" television productions by other fine actors.",1326326400,18,5485,5.015452538631346
