2332,5,0510539610,"This is a great product! I appreciate how well each exercise is described and shown visually so it's easy to follow along without feeling like you need a translator to understand them.  I also like the fact that I can DO the exercises as shown (and I am no gymnast...just an everyday mom).  I highly recommend this product!

2333,5,0510539610,"If your doctor has recommended pelvic floor physical therapy this a good alternative to scheduling times at a clinic.  Within three weeks of beginning the program, three times per week, I had significant improvement.  That was just using the first 3 workouts on the dvd.  I haven't attempted the fourth workout yet.  Not that it looks too hard, I just want to get a pilates ball if I'm going to do it. These exercises work more than just the pelvic floor.  There are several muscles that work in conjunction as is explained on the dvd.  It also shows patients of all ages and fitness levels performing the exercises so don't be put off if you're out of shape - they aren't that hard to do. I planned to go on to a clinic if this wasn't helping me but that won't be necessary now.  Saved me time and money. Well worth the $29 to see if it will work for you.",1264982400,84,856,4.279503105590062

I was pregnant with my second child, and did not want to that happen again.  Even with only using this 1-2 times per week, I noticed a big difference.  I would definitely recommend this to anyone with vaginal wall prolapse, or anyone with stress urinary incontinence.  The video is boring, but it works!",1501027200,4,419,4.684931506849315
2341,1,0510539610,"I discovered I had a vaginal prolapse after having issues removing a tampon (I typically wear pads, but was in a bind back in May and wore a tampon for the first time in my life). The prolapse is most likely from the birth of my daughter two years ago. I began my research on what to do for it, as I don't want to have or eventually have surgery for it (I've heard way too many horror stories). I started doing this DVD back in the very beginning of June...and instead of doing it three times a week, I ramped it up to roughly one workout every day/other day. I cycled through exercises one through four for each day I did it. I went out and bought an exercise ball (well, two - a large and a small) and additional stretch bands. I also did kegals, as suggested, throughout the day everyday (held kegal for 8 seconds with four quick flicks). It is now mid-July and my vaginal prolapse is no better and no worse than when I started the exercises. Literally no improvement whatsoever.

Does this have the possibility to help other women? It apparently has and probably will for some, but it did absolutely nothing for me.",1499904000,10,1119,4.328571428571428

I am going to a physical therapist  and this was just a reinforcement and some extra info the PT did not cover. Need to learn as much as possible to recover and live a life again.  I am 60 and have a mild prolaspe of bladder, rectum , uterus,  and cervix. I could not function without a tremendous amount of pelvic pressure before starting physical therapy, now after 2 1/2 months, I was able to hike up to 12 miles again, bike, and garden.

I'm in my second week of Pelvic Floor DVD, still on exercise group 1, but can now do high jumps, 18 at a time without a problem and jumping jacks.  I also notice the feeling to urinate all the time is disappearing. I kept doing the full workout with the explanation as I was not certain I was doing it correct but I have now moved on to the express workout. Will work on No. 2 next and continue.

I like the fact that Tasha works the surrounding muscles to help support the pelvic muscles.  I also like her manner and presentation; it is straight forward aid direct.

I have yet to see if it skips on workout 3 and 4 and the time efficient workouts 2-4.

I do not have a quality review yet of the actual program and if it works yet, but I plan to update my review after a few weeks.

She explains each exercise thoroughly.  After a few weeks, my prolapse felt almost gone.  Then I got the stomach flu so didn't do these exercises for a week and the prolapse got noticeably worse again.  Anyways I  am now back to doing these exercises again.  I am sold on these and would recommend them to anyone postpartum, even somebody who doesn't have a diagnosed prolapse.  An extra bonus is that my husband absolutely loves how I hold myself using the posture this video not only explains but also strengthens the right muscles to enable you to hold during the day.  I have also tried a couple workout videos from Whole Woman and met with a WW representative, but in my opinion the workouts on this PT video are far superior.

I stuck with exercise #1 and despite my best efforts only squeezed in the workouts about every three days.  However, it still worked!  After a few weeks my symptoms had almost entirely disappeared, and I was back to my favorite exercise of walking hills, now with a much more informed and capable ""basket.""

This DVD reduced the symptoms after 4 weeks and has continued to be helpful to the point where I am not experiencing stress incontinence at all. An unexpected bonus-- my posture has improved a great deal as a result of this DVD because it exercises core muscles in addition to the pelvic floor. In general I've found the exercises good, although I am unable to do the squats in the workouts because of an ankle stability problem. (I've substituted wall squats instead.) I will continue with these exercises and am adding core exercises because they are very helpful in daily living.",1466467200,18,651,4.981651376146789

2376,5,0510539610,I found myself dealing with a prolapse 6 weeks postpartum with my fifth child. As a very active person I did not feel like this should be a controlling factor in my life and immediately began looking for some solutions. I quickly ruled out surgery as anything but a last resort since it seemed to have lots of risk and little return. So I decided to check into rehabilitation. That is when I cam across this DVD and promptly ordered it figuring it was way cheaper than doing PT in an office somewhere. I have now been doing these workouts for over 2 months and they have made a HUGE difference! I am now hopeful that by the time my baby is weaned I will be back to full speed.

I used this video regularly for a couple months. During the same time, I used pelvic weights. I think both were helpful and I met my goals. This video would benefit from an update. Also, the short version cut some transition time between exercises and was hard to keep up with, but the long version wasn't needed after the first couple times through.",1460764800,13,540,4.75531914893617
2380,5,0510539610,I've been doing the workout for about a month and I'm already noticing results and I'm only on workout one.

2381,5,0510539610,"I bought the digital download ($13) from the hab-it website.  (I did not receive any discounts or promotions.) I have three children and was having some pretty severe issues after the third birth.  Wow, I wish I had known about it before!  Would totally buy again; cheaper than one PT session! Great, progressive PT exercises.  After 2 months of doing them about 5 times a week it has made a huge difference with my 'undercarriage' problems, which were getting pretty bad and which are now about 90% better.  It also helped the small amount of abdominal separation I had from the pregnancy!

Definitely watch the intros at least once; they help make the exercises more effective.  I find that a small portion of my bedroom floor (or even the bed) and an inexpensive child's ball are sufficient for most exercises.  It does take about 29 minutes to go through each routine, but it's worth it.",1459296000,9,891,4.703225806451613

Having worked with professional physical therapists with little success, I had almost given up hope of ever regaining function in my low back and pelvic floor. From the first time I pressed play and went through the workout I could feel a huge difference. The functional approach to the entire pelvic floor and supporting muscles was exactly what I needed. For the first time in years I have hope that my condition has and will continue to improve and consequently grant me better functionality and pain relief.

I am very appreciative of Tasha's excellent demonstrations and counting out loud reminders as to when  to squeeze so you don't have to try and watch the exercise while you are doing it once you are familiar with the process.

Doctor told me my only real option was having the mesh put in or a hysterectomy when I was older, as I was still too young. I want more kids in the future, so that really was not an option.

This DVD starts slow, and you think these workouts really do nothing, but after just a week of use I could tell the difference! I have never been more grateful for a purchase than this one.

I had stage 2 bladder prolapse, doctors told me just have more sex, at 65 I'd rather do laundry, and  besides you'd have to it everyday. They just make you feel that your old and useless. Which I'm not, I'm active, live on a hobby farm and I'm in great shape. Now I can do even more since I don't have to go to the bathroom all the time.",1445731200,25,484,4.041666666666667
2406,5,0510539610,"Well worth the money and more. I currently go to physical therapy as referred by my OB due to pelvic organ prolapse (after having my second child). My PT only tells me to do kegels, but I told her about Han-it and she says that I should keep doing the Hab-it videos if I have them. Strengthening the core is known to help strengthen the pelvic floor (many articles and women's magazines recommend similar exercises that Tasha Mulligan includes in her DVD).  I have been doing this DVD for 6 weeks (haven't skipped one day) and I feel a lot better. She says you can do every other day, but I had time due to maternity leave so I wanted to do as much as possible to improve faster. Just don't overdo the kegel portion.

Tips:
Go to her website Hab-it.com.
1. She has the videos in downloadable format to put in your phone. I didn't see this till later. Alternatively you can download a program like handbrake for your computer to convert DVD to QuickTime video to put on your phone, which I did. This gave me no excuses. I also screenshotted the exercises and saved them on my phone so by the time I did these exercises for weeks I only needed to see the screenshot and not open the video to prompt me to do the exercises.
2. She has a 7-day advanced workout so if these 4 workouts are getting too easy or you plateaued, buy the advanced workout! It's more variety, longer, and really kicks your butt. I bought this after I was doing all 4 exercises everyday and it was getting boring and long.

A nice side effect of these exercises is I'm more toned and lost some weight too! I still have some prolapse but my PT says it feels a lot less and my kegels are stronger too. This is an amazing program.",1445472000,42,1697,4.280373831775701
2407,5,0510539610,"Great dvd for those of us with bladder problems.  I'm 72 and started having problems while sneezing, coughing.

2417,5,0510539610,"Fred's wife here...  So 4 weeks after having a beautiful 8.5lb baby boy, it was very apparent that I had a prolapsed bladder :(  I had 2 weeks to go before my first postnatal Dr's appointment but I didn't need him to tell me what was already obvious. So I started to do some research and came across the Hab It DVD. Ladies, it is well worth the $20 or $30. I started  doing the Hab It video at 5 weeks postpartum 5x per week and within 3 weeks I could tell it was already improving.  I couldn't get a pelvic floor physical therapy appointment ( which my OB/GYN prescribed) until 2 months after my 6 week appointment and I'm so happy I had this dvd.  It goes beyond just kegel exercises and will help your core in general  get stronger.  My baby is 5 months old now and my bladder prolapse is still there but soooo much better. I'm pretty confident by the time he's a year old I will rarely think about it. If you any sort of pelvic floor issues don't ignore them! You must work to make them get better.

2426,5,0510539610,"This was a lifesaver for me. After the birth of my second child I felt great and was very excited to get back to running after about 4 weeks because I had stayed fit/run throughout pregnancy and was itching to get back into my old routine. I went for a short run and felt something 'shift'. I ended up with a uterine prolapse, 2nd/3rd degree. Upon searching the internet and talking to my OB I was completely devastated. I was a D1 college track and cross country athlete and running is a defining part of my life...I was told from all angles that I was never going to run again and the only resolution was going to be surgery after being done having kids. I went through a couple of months very depressed, mean and just overall miserable. After a fellow mom mentioned this DVD I decided to give it a try. After a month of doing the DVD every other day I added in some weight training and really focused on building my core, hip flexor and and lower back muscles. In late January I started to run again, starting with a qtr of a mile at a time and raised the distance by a qtr of a mile each week. I just ran a half marathon a week ago at 8 months postpartum and am back to running like my old self.  I highly encourage anybody dealing with prolapse or any other pelvic floor issues to try this DVD before agreeing to any surgery...mine is completely gone and for that I am so grateful.",1431648000,158,1386,4.2105263157894735

Get your body in a corect posture where you won't be feeling your prolapse and start jogging. Trust me, you will feel great and your abdominal muscles will start fixing your pelvic floor. As well, your weight will be better, thats what bothers your lower muscles. Great dvd, fast shipping to Greece.

The results have been wonderful,my pelvic floor has gotten stronger,I noticed a difference in the first week. I plan to continue these exercises. Tasha Mulligan's instruction is top notch,she explains all the reasons why we need a strong pelvic floor and core,she also gives good instruction on how we can tell if we are in the proper posture stance.

I cried through my first two workouts due to embarrassment and sadness at needing these workouts.  However, I quickly got over it and I quickly saw results in pain reduction and lessening of urgency.  These workouts are easy to follow, demonstrated perfectly, and you are encouraged throughout in a soft-spoken, encouraging voice.  Training your pelvic floor is tricky and awkward, but it is worth remaining true to!!  Interstitial Cystitis or PFD sufferers--this must be a staple in your recovery.  I can't wait to purchase the 6-pack workout video Mulligan recommends!!  The only gripe I have with the video is that I am potentially barren and the narrator mentions a ""bundle of joy"" or ""your little one"" as encouragement or reward for finishing a workout (or even for having PFD, which I'm sure a lot of you moms out there feel that way--but I may never be one).  Some of us have PFD without the joys (or results) of motherhood, and these comments made me feel even more isolated.

I had heard you pee your pants when jumping after bearing children, so why was that happening to me at age 16?  I always heard, 'do your kegels' but never felt I understood how.  Like how often and in what position and how many.  I didn't feel I knew if I was doing them correctly or even remembered to do them.  12 years and 2 kids later, I'm having a lot of pelvic pain and can't even use tampons because they just don't fit right anymore.
I have researched a bit into vaginal weights, but always get overwhelmed and then stop shopping.  One day when talking to a friend, I finally decided I had to buckle down and order something.  I about cried when someone said in a review for weights that they didn't work with a prolapse.  It describes the symptoms I had with tampons and said a doctor may not mention a minor prolapse.  I had thought things just weren't quite right in there.  But what to do now?  I kept seeing this stupid dvd for sale and thought, ""no! I need equipment"".  When I finally read reviews, I felt hopeful and knew I needed to try it.
I've not been perfect about using it, but have been pretty decent.  And even if I haven't made it through an entire workout, once in bed, I actually remember to do kegels and feel like I can actually do them.  I apparently needed to be walked through it the way this lady does it.  And the visuals really help.  Yes it gets annoying to listen to.  But I just listen to something else and watch for cues.
I feel that things are changing and I haven't had the pelvic pain!  I'm hopeful that things will continue to improve as I continue with the program.  Yes, it just may be worth your money to buy a stupid dvd.  Think if it as physical therapy, because it is.  For someone with less problems than I have, other options may be best,  but if you have very little pelvic floor strength,  this is a great place to start!",1412553600,10,1944,4.2228260869565215

At age 40, after having four children, I was very active walking, running, biking, rollerblading. But all of that exercise apparently didn't do much for my pelvic floor. I had a level 3 bladder prolapse, was talked into surgery using a transvaginal mesh bladder sling (Yep, the kind you see on the lawyer commercials on tv). Long story short, that was 4 years ago. I was one of the 15% of women who have severe complications from mesh surgeries. The mesh eroded through my vagina, urethra, caused severe nerve and muscle damage, and ultimately had to be removed surgically. After 7 surgeries to try to deal with all the problems this mesh caused, I am now disabled, living in chronic severe vaginal/pelvic pain, unable to sit at all, and unable to work anymore. And guess what? I still leak when I cough & sneeze after all of that! So please, please try this before you consider surgery. I'm using this DVD now to try to get some strength back in my pelvic floor, but it is too late for me - the damage is done.

This thing is amazing. I can actually see on the screen how strong my muscles are contracting when I do a kegel exercise. I had no idea how weak my muscles really were but this machine measures your strength and ranks you according to levels. I started at level 2 (weak muscles) and am rapidly improving because I can SEE how much I need to push myself. With this Hab It dvd, I thought I was working hard but never really knew where I was at so I didn't push myself even though I thought I was.

I already knew that I was having problems with a nervous bladder, but when I experienced a prolapse, I was frightened.  After doing some research, I found that prior to any surgery or other medical things, a round of physical therapy would be ordered. I decided I'd rather do this in the privacy and comfort of my own home. Tasha Mulligan is a PT and specialized in this area. The anatomy and explanations are well done and well presented for visualization. This was important - and helpful - to me. Also helpful, is the quiet, matter of fact voice, the pace of the workouts, and her counting. I can't count, concentrate and exercise at the same time - I need someone else counting!  It took a full month of using this on the FIRST set of workouts, before I could slightly feel the muscles move.  It was in the second month that I began noticing the improvement of bladder issues, with the other nice side effect of seeing a slightly thinner waist and stomach muscles. The third month, the prolapse was not bothering me.  I have followed up with my OBGYN who let me know I was doing the right thing and encouraged me to keep it up.  I'm still only doing the first and part of the second sets of workouts.  I am well-pleased with the results and grateful that Tasha Mulligan put it out.",1393718400,13,1351,4.38

I can honestly say that after one month, my pelvic floor is in better shape than before I had children. The DVD is informative, easy to follow, and extremely effective. I highly reccomend it, and only wish I knew about it following my first delivery!",1376611200,13,404,4.785714285714286

Once you have the hang of it you can do a shortened one that doesn't take you thru the instructions again.,1376179200,7,262,4.6521739130434785

Also, even if you don't have a pelvic floor problem, this is a great graduated core workout that anyone, man or woman, would benefit from.  I would imagine that the posture and core strengthening would help a myriad of issues.

This is money well spent.",1375401600,9,489,4.773809523809524
2540,5,0510539610,"I am writing this review for any postpartum women who are crying as they are scouring the internet for solutions to their prolapse.  My pregnancy and labor did a number on my pelvic floor- very active lifting and exercising all through pregnancy, induced at 42 weeks, in labor for 30 hours, pushed for 3 hours, was being prepped for c-section when finally forceps were used at the very last second and my 9 lb 13 oz baby was born sunny side up with a very large head and his hand pressed to his forehead. I didn't stand a chance at walking away without some trauma.  I cried every night over how things looked and felt and was saving up for surgery.  6 months later my gynecologist shrugged her shoulders and said prolapse like I had to live with it.  I tried a women's health physical therapist which helped a little but not enough.

I got this DVD and wasn't sure if it was really doing anything until after doing it diligently for 4 weeks, life got in the way and I skipped the workouts for a couple weeks and all of a sudden I could feel that things were slipping back.  This truly works for me and has given me hope that things can get back in place, or at least closer to where they should be.  And I am no longer fearful of having a second pregnancy and delivery.

This is much cheaper than physical therapy, very informative, it works, and has given me hope.  I am so thankful that this product exists.",1374537600,186,1410,4.3106060606060606

Tasha Mulligan explains the anatomy and physiology of a woman's body and really takes the time to explain each exercise.  It is wonderful to have a fast tract too once one is sure of the proper technique of each exercise.  For me, it is nice to see that my physical therapist and Tasha Mulligan's teaching align.

I was recommended to have surgery, but in only 1 month I have seen a tremendous improvement. The $30 has been worth every penny considering I won't be missing work for surgery or dealing with all the issues involved with weak pelvic muscles. She is so thorough in her directions and has a time efficient work out for those of us that are time crunched! I feel so fortunate to have stumbled onto this DVD! I can't recommend it enough! The muscles can be tricky to locate and she even uses graphics to help you isolate muscles that most of us are not familiar with.",1366156800,15,664,4.450819672131147

I do additional squats with the video after learning how important squats are for the PC muscles as well.,1358726400,23,411,4.732394366197183

2570,5,0510539610,"I have lived with my mild, yet annoying prolapse for several years,however suddenly it made a dramatic and HUGE descent, causing recurrent bladder infections, difficulty in walking, irritation and then BLOOD!. That sent me to the emergency room at my local clinic (doctor's office closed that day) where the attending physician recommended immediate surgery. He suceeded in pushing it back in and when I got home,I improvised a temporary ""sling"" and would periodically gently push ""it"" back in myself. When I got the DVD, I was absolutely amazed because after the very first work-out, there was definite improvement. Each day gets better and better. My biggest problem has been figuring out how to advance the DVD to the next segment - am sure that is my fault as I am not very skilled at dealing with my  electronic gadgets. I AM FOREVER GRATEFUL TO HAB IT:PELVIC FLOOR  and not only endorse it, but BEG  those who are dealing with prolapse to order it immediately before you consent to not-always-successful surgery.",1353715200,72,1018,4.976470588235294

I thought I will have to live with it forever and was very depressed. Then I did a lot of reading, researching about remedies and also went to a few physical therapist sessions.  I would say that this is the most helpful exercise among all. From other reviewers' comments, it seems that I will have to constantly follow this exercise; otherwise the prolapse comes back. I very much prefer doing this to  the feeling of prolapse.",1352678400,20,604,4.635514018691588

I didn't notice this on any product descriptions before I bought the DVD, but she does recommend using an exercise ball and a smaller ball for some of the exercises.  I have a small ball and have used a chair in place of the exercise ball.  (She says you can substitute a pillow for the small ball, and a chair for the exercise ball.) This has worked quite well, except that there is one exercise in the final workout that I could not on a chair.  You may have better luck, but I'm avoiding that workout, which is still too advanced for me anyway, until I get an exercise ball.",1346025600,13,761,4.438848920863309

I was always been ""shallow"" and I still have a couple of inches before everything is perfect, but my cervix is now at least four inches higher.  They should hand these out at the hospital.

Incidentally, I slacked for a week,thinking I was fixed, and my prolapse symptoms started to return. These exercises work, and also provide some gentle toning postpartum.

Tara thoroughly describes the exercises and why they help, and she's very easy to understand and listen to. However, it's not just kegels. It's also abdominal, back, and upper leg workouts, which all help more than just kegels alone. However, the workouts take a long time (the shortest one is 8 minutes, and that's AFTER you've mastered the moves first) and I just do not have time to do these with a toddler running around and my busy schedule. If I had plenty of free time or was a stay-at-home-mom, I would do these every day because I know they'd help and it has great reviews.

She loves that there is a lot of guidance and explanation to begin but then, once you understand and don't want or need to take all that time to complete your workout, there is the time efficiency section.  She also likes seeing the graphic visual alongside the model performing the exercises. She likes that it is not a trendy workout so someone could have used these techniques and exercises 100 years ago or 100 years from now.

The information was good on the DVD...but the experience of trying to get it to play was grueling.
Another huge disappointment was that this item comes with no written list of the exercises...so if you want to do them on your own without a DVD player you are out of luck.  I cannot speak to the effectiveness of the exercises as it is almost impossible to do them unless you plan on doing them in the same location day after day.

After doing these videos for just a week and a half it is no longer a problem! I can't believe how quickly it was resolved! I'd recommend it to anyone experiencing any type of pelvic or incontinence issues!",1311552000,34,340,4.683333333333334
2593,5,0510539610,"I went to a physical therapist for prolapse, but did not receive this type of information. It was so helpful to have the educational content on this before starting the workout. The workouts are well paced and explained extremely well, along with how they help. Having the workout in DVD form is extremely beneficial, although it does take more time to set up. I also like the blog on their website for more information. I feel relief that this is a condition that can be changed by sticking with the program!",1310860800,17,509,4.604395604395604
2594,5,0510539610,"I learned about this CD on the forum at prolapsehealth.com and started using it at 4 weeks postpartum and its just fantastic.  It is appropriate for both beginners and seasoned exercisers.  The length of each workout is perfect for busy moms.  The instructions are clear, easy to understand and follow, and anatomically correct.  The accompanying blog is very good.  The workouts are flexible and can be done alone or combined.  Most importantly, it works.  At 8 weeks postpartum I no longer have any irritating symptoms and as a delightful bonus my whole lower body muscle tone is improved.  My only regret is that I didn't know about this 4 babies ago.  Highly, highly recommend!",1307059200,33,681,4.9035087719298245
2595,5,0510539610,"I'm very grateful to Mrs Mullingan's Pelvic floor work-out : it's very easy to do,and after one month you can both feel and see the difference! Pelvic Floor is really ""healthier"" and it's very pleasant too, you will see your stomach is really more tough and flat. I have four children... and now I feel much more healthier and self confident. And when you begin to see results, it gives you motivation and energy, even after a rough day, to do one of the three different work-out.",1305331200,34,480,4.528735632183908

It made me more aware of my muscles which I have been tightening regularly, doing some of the exercises as the day went on.  I have a prolapsed uterus and cystocele since pregnancy 10 years ago, and yesterday the uterus just moved back into place!  Very cool, my body feels like it did years ago, everything in the right place.  Thanks to the people who made this video, will keep using it indefinitely!!!!!!",1304467200,69,476,4.436781609195402

There are 4 workouts.  I have been doing workout 1 and 2.  3 and 4 are more difficult.  I'm working my way up.  I'm not sure how long to stick with one workout before moving up.  AFter you learn a workout you can switch to the time efficient workout.
These exercises seem to help.  I just started a couple of weeks ago so I don't know what the long term outcome will be.",1302134400,8,394,3.9240506329113924
2598,5,0510539610,"This is an excellent dvd for those who suffer from pelvic floor muscle weakness. I found this video to be very informative,explaining in an easy to understand manner the function of the pelvic floor muscles and the importance in regaining their strength after surgery,childbirth or simply the effects of aging. After a detailed explanation there are 3 separate segments of specific exercise routines to regain tone of the pelvic floor. I was very impressed with this video and wish I had known about it before I spent hundreds of dollars in a local physical therapy office where I felt extremely uncomfortable and embarrassed and therefore,did not obtain the positive results I had hoped for. This dvd has enabled me to practice these specific exercises in the privacy of my home without fear of embarrassment that sufferers of pelvic floor muscle problems sometimes feel. I would recommend this video to all who suffer from pelvic floor muscle weakness.",1301529600,39,954,5.082802547770701

I have been plagued with muscle spasms after a hysterectomy, bladder sling and correction of a rectocele and cystocele over a year ago.  Even though I am only 42, I have been unable to sit for any length of time and unable to resume jogging and exercise.

I'm so grateful to have found this DVD on Amazon.  After only two sessions of exercises, I am already feeling fitter.

I am also very impressed that the PT responded to my feedback email and gave me some tips that have helped even more.",1299024000,59,577,4.563106796116505
2600,4,0510539610,"I have noticed a difference after just a few rounds, but the routines take about 20 minutes each, plus the time to set up the dvd, and I have a hard time doing them regularly. This is of course my fault, not the program's, which is an excellent program, easy to do and easy to follow. But if you have a busy schedule, you might prefer a kegel excersizer, which does't require a DVD and set amount of time.",1297123200,19,405,4.139240506329114
2601,5,0510539610,"This is truly a wonderful product.  I had a cystocele (bladder prolapse) after the birth of my second child and was utterly devastated at how restricted I felt because of the bothersome symptoms.  I just want to share that after only 4 weeks of doing these exercises I have had HUGE improvements.

This DVD is made by and actual physical therapist who specializes in Pelvic Floor rehab and had a grade III cystocele herself after each one of her 3 kids.  It is clear,concise and packed full of helpful info.  The exercises are not too difficult and I actually find them somewhat relaxing. It only takes six weeks (doing one of the workouts 3 times/week) to fully rehab your pelvic floor and then just maintenance Kegels after that.  It is a wonderful product for only $30!!!  I HIGHLY recommend it to ANY new mom with or without prolapse.  It can not only help current prolapse issues but also help prevent them in the future!!",1286496000,52,927,4.609756097560975
2602,5,0510539610,"Having had a background in anatomy and physiology as a outcome-based massage therapist, I am quite familiar with how the body works. I have been athletic all my life until I recently had two pregnancies back to back. Both, natural births at home, took quite a toll on my pelvic floor. My midwife had a few resources which I reviewed but knew they were missing a lot of information and/or had a lot of other information I didn't care for like healing the ""spiritual"" aspect of the pelvic floor. Hab-it Pelvic Floor is like going to a high quality physical therapist in your own living room! The price is minimal for the benefits you receive. I can't sing their praises enough. Very detailed, very clear and concise, exactly what was needed for me to be guided into healing and getting things back where they belong. Already seeing a difference and it's only been a few weeks in. Note: video includes excellent information segment and then exercise segment which is divided into four different workouts. You just have to do one of the workouts each time, three times a week. So one of the four, three times a week, any of the four. The fourth being the most difficult. Once you get used to how they go, there is even a section of time efficient workouts so you can save time. Love this DVD! Recommended it to my midwife and she is thrilled about it too - giving it to her clients in the future. May consider giving this as a gift to new moms!",1282608000,288,1440,4.458333333333333
2603,5,0510539610,"After my 2nd baby I had a prolapsed bladder...was told by the midwife that I'll eventually need surgery & that's all I could do (surgery that doesn't even fix the problem)...

I heard about this from another Mama & so glad I got it...

After 2 times I couldn't feel the prolaspe @ all.  At the end of the 6 weeks (which is all it takes) it's completely GONE!

At first, I thought ""$30 whoa!""  But this is by a PHYSICAL THERAPIST who had prolapse herself, so if I were to go to a physical therapist, it would cost a LOT MORE AND I would have to go to an appt. a few times a week...this is awesome b/c I can stay @ home w/ my baby & newborn & do it!

I CAN'T THANK THE WOMAN WHO CREATED THIS DVD ENOUGH!!!",1278720000,301,703,3.915492957746479
7788081,5,0510539610,Excellent program. Includes 4 workouts on DVD + a workout band. The program has you start with the first workout and work your way up to doing the others as your muscles get stronger. The video has very detailed instructions. It also has an option to watch a shorter version after you're familiar with the exercises to save time. I've been doing it daily for a month and I'm already seeing results.

Many have complained and she does nothing to remedy the situation and keeps sending out defective product. That said, it's pretty good except WHEN will some of the exercise DVD's have a section that JUST has the exercises and not the whole instructions preceeding. Every time you want to play it and ""follow along"" you have to mess with fast forwarding through all the endless explanations ...Still, if you do these every day you will strengthen your pelvic floor, just be ready to hassle with returns.",1523491200,,674,4.869565217391305

About 10 weeks ago I discovered I had a prolapse (felt like a tampon was always falling out of me and so uncomfortable walking around, lower back ache, pressure in rectal area) and after research I immediately purchased this DVD. I was dedicated and disciplined doing the workouts at least 4-5 days a week and being conscious of how I was sitting, lifting and so on. I'm thrilled to report that after about 7 weeks all of my symptoms have gone away and I feel normal again! I still do the exercises 2-3 days a week and kegels every day and I'm planning to slowly add in other workouts to gain further strenth.
