The cliffhangers from Season 2 get resolved, while new antics are introduced and cringe levels reach new heights.  I thoroughly enjoyed this season, which has 8 episodes.  My only complaint is that I must wait for the Season 4 DVD I ordered to arrive so I can continue experiencing this great TV show!",1520553600,,373,4.707692307692308
