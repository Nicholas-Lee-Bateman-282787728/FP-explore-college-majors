8187697,3,B000OYNT5U,"My Wife is native Chinese and encouraged me to buy this movie.  She's told me for a long time about the series of movies she'd watched, growing up in China, about the classic Chinese story ""Journey to the West.""  This particular movie is based on one piece of that story, about the Monkey King having an evil double and causing lots of trouble for everyone.

Unfortunately, the movie is only in Chinese.  If there are English subtitles, I couldn't find them in the all-Chinese language menu selection even with my wife's help.

The action is actually quite good and the music was also enjoyable, but I happen to like just about any Asian-style music.  It's not for everyone.

My wife's opinion was that this was not the best Chinese-produced version movie from the ""Journey to the West"" she'd ever seen, and was not happy with it.  So I guess my review would be; if you are fluent in Mandarin, or enjoy watching a movie in a language you don't understand, without English sub-titles, then this is for you.",1212019200,5,1005,4.606741573033708
