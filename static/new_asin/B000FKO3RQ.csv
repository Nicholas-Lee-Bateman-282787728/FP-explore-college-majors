2570246,5,B000FKO3RQ,"From its inception on the web through Flash media, Broken Saints has been picking up steam ever since the first episode. While it does take some time to get into the main story, it is one of the best ever told. There is so much thought, design, and especially heart put into each episode. The entire series is chock full of religious tokens, political commentaries, gorgeous artwork, beautiful music, exceptional writing, and layers and layers of symbolism that separated it from everything else on the web.

The new DVD improves on nearly every aspect of the original series. The music, artwork, the addition of many voice talents, subtitles, easter eggs, commentaries, and extra videos make the price worth it.

Broken Saints may not be for everyone, but everyone should at least give it a try since it is so different than typical outlets of expression. It is one of the few things that has truly touched and changed my life (even if that change is small and unconscious).",1147651200,4,975,4.7976190476190474
2570247,5,B000FKO3RQ,"Well there isn't much else to say then what has already been said. I don't know if I can compare this series to any other type of animation because it simply does not exsist until now.  the extras Brooke Burgess(writer and directior)has selected for the dvd are very personal and intimate I felt like I was along side himself, Andrew, and Ian as the series was being created. Go ahead take a chance and watch this masterpiece and pass it along to your friends.",1147651200,3,460,4.476190476190476
2570248,5,B000FKO3RQ,"This set is not only an example of excellent technical achievement, but also of outstanding story-telling in a long format. This is very much worth the time you'll spend on it!",1147651200,3,176,4.709677419354839
2570249,5,B000FKO3RQ,"It blows my mind that 3 (extra)ordinary young men could produce such a thing of beauty being driven only by sheer determination, creativity, and genius. They have struggled so much to create this masterpiece and I am grateful for that. And I am not alone...in only a few years Broken Saints has been admired by all who see it, winning numerous awards and getting praise from critics of all kinds. It didn't take FOX long to get interested! In fact, it might be some kind of record. But that's another story, which this DVD also tells.

The series itself is amazing, unlike anything else I've seen. It's basically a vividly colorful comic book brought to life with smooth animation, done in Macromedia flash. Originally this series was not done with voices, only speech bubbles. But now there is a cast of amazing voice actors giving new life to the already incredibly deep and interesting characters.

The story, while slow-paced, is introspective and realistic. Depth and true character is brought to the 4 main characters, giving you insight into their motivations, thoughts, and emotions. The combination of storytelling, art, and fluid animation expertly portrays this saga in a gripping and intense way.

I can think of few other things that can have me glued in front of my TV for 12 hours straight. If it weren't for my body's demand for rest, I could have easily watched the entire series in one night. Time flies as you are swept away into the world of Broken Saints. It truly is an experience.",1147564800,6,1503,4.773076923076923
2570250,5,B000FKO3RQ,"""Broken Saints"" is not a movie. It is an experience. It is a 12-hour portion of your life that will leave you breathless. I had the joy of watching the series multiple times: the original version on Newgrounds.com, and for each subsequent time, the DVD version, with new art, voice acting by some talented stars, and a wealth of treasures and Easter Eggs.

If you don't enjoy high-end, intelligent dialogue, don't purchase this DVD set; you won't be able to appreciate it. ""Broken Saints"" is the kind of film in which you must actively participate, trying to understand the nuances as the narrative unfolds. If you feel overwhelmed at times, don't worry. After all, the series deals with overwhelming things: faith, hope, will, and love. It has purposefully lofty goals, and it could have either soared or crashed in a burning heap. Without doubt, ""Broken Saints"" soars. You will not be able to finish without feeling something, whether it be fear, anger, or (if you truly understand it) hope.

Perhaps the best part about the series is the community. Creator Brooke Burgess is a highly-approachable, charismatic man who keeps the ""Broken Saints"" website updated regularly for all fans. You always feel welcome. Although I have never met Brooke personally, I consider him a friend. And this is just icing on an already delicious, densely-packed cake.

""Broken Saints"" gets a 5 out of 5 and a full recommendation. You will not be disappointed!",1147478400,8,1442,4.950413223140496

A true work of love and dedication, and a new artform in and of itself.

2570274,5,B000FKO3RQ,"When I first saw the trailer for this back in college, I knew I had to see it. Sadly, it would take 6 years from seeing the trailer to finally get a copy of it. Now that I have it, I'm not dissappointed.
Brooke Burgress calls this ""cinematic literature,"" while it may be so, it's also much more. Looking beyond the flashy animations, complex sound effects, and multilayered storyline, it's a mire of different genres, among them being technothriller, urban punk, philosophical literature, and even conspiracy thriller, along with psychological thriller. Just with the technothriller area and how it has an integral element of computer hacking, it got my attention front-and-center.
4 seemingly random people who don't know each other end up getting mixed in to each other's lives when ""random"" occurences force them together to face a very dangerous happening: a well-known telecommunication company is using technology to, in the near future, use its own technology to induce fear into every individual on Earth and use their fear as a means of brainwashing them to accept the head conspirator's view of ""truth,"" which has nothing good included, only fear, death, and extreme hatred. And it's only up to these four strangers to stop it from happening.
Over the course of 24 chapters, we see alternating points of view of what's going on, so you don't see only a biased American's view, a naive Fiji native's view, a confused Buddhist's view, nor just a saddened Muslim's view. You see them all, and sometimes they're conflicting, sometimes they get along (tediously), but they have to learn to depend on each other to get through it.
Keep in mind, this is not family-friendly viewing at all. Very heavy swearing (especially in the chapter ""Signals""), some mature themes (including sexual jeers and soldiers making crude sexual statements about those they hate), and some rather heavy-handed violence. Not to mention some disturbing images (for anyone that loves animals, one of the later episodes will definitely disturb them deeply). Like I said, not family-friendly.
This is truly thought-provoking material, even with occassional comical moments it had.
Who knows? Maybe this could inspire some new media entertainment styles in the future. I know one thing, I enjoyed this very well.",1359331200,2,2288,5.120320855614973
2570275,5,B000FKO3RQ,"Presentation-wise, what the original BS did was groundbreaking for its time, an epic endeavor that today may look fairly tame even with the re-touched visuals.  Even still, you've probably never seen anything like this before.  Finally, the voice-acting IS tacked on (not in original), you CAN turn them off, but they set the often dark and desperate mood quite well.  Raimi is snarky exactly when he needs to be, and Janyse Jaud does a remarkable job pulling off a very difficult role of Shandala.

But the real treat is the story and the great craftsmanship Burgess uses to find the words most fitting.  This is not the bible; this is not a comic book.  The language and style is Burgess' own unique poetry style, and I think it does a good job of capturing the process of understanding and coming to grips with the truth.  The philosophical issues explored in this piece may not be PhD level, but the way in which they are explored is novel and half of understanding is the process itself.  I am a philosophy graduate from an ivy league school, and while not an expert, I have read millions of pages of various treatises on the major themes BS involves itself in.  I can say with a straight face that there are only a small handful of movies/comics which presents the raw process of contemplation as well as BS does.  Unless you completely dismiss all continental and structrualist philosophy as worthless, you will find great value in BS.  I often recommend this series as art for the educated philosopher/theologian.  It is obvious that Burgess has mastered all of the couple of hundred quotes and referances he cites to in this series.

BS is not uniformly great, and at several points the story is clunky and you can see Burgess struggling with transitions within a 12-hour opera that both progresses the plot while simultaniously deepening the themes.  Burgess is also rarely as funny or witty as he thinks it is, and what passes for humor creates some of the more cringe-worthy moments in the series.  But as an overall product, I would give it 6 stars if Amazon let me, for crafting such a great story, and presenting it in such an effective fashion, and most of all, for not losing the underlying focus of the piece.  This is one of those series where you are forced to watch 3-4 times over despite the length simply because much of the repeating dialogue, symbols, referances, and subliminal flashes are necessarily lost on you the first time through. Burgess knows exactly where he wants to go with this from the first word, and he gets there in brilliant fashion.  A very pleasant ride for the mind and the soul.

TLDR; Must-buy if you like dark moody philosophical pieces that really make you THINK and FEEL.  Don't-buy if you are impatient, looking for a sci-fi story that will blow you away, or just in it for the fight scenes (which are fairly epic, but sparse).",1296864000,2,2880,4.6561264822134385
2570276,5,B000FKO3RQ,"The artwork is outstanding.  The story is the right mixture of poetry and action.  It is moody, brooding, and dark in some instances.",1282521600,,133,4.739130434782608
2570277,2,B000FKO3RQ,"I myself don't care very much for apocalyptic stories, save for a few. But, my parents got this for me for Christmas, thinking it was kind of anime-ish (I GUESS it counts as anime - I dunno!)and thought I would like it.  I love comics and anime/manga, so this was intriguing. The idea itself of animated comics is a good one, and they way the ""panels"" displayed on DVD was brilliant.  The storyline, however, literally put me to sleep!  Things move very, very slowly,and all the characters' dialouge was poetic to the point of overkill and, to me, blocked my understanding of what was going on in general. I'm starting to wander if this comic epic was just praised for the graphics. If so, how dissapointing! My parents wasted thier money on this one.",1261958400,2,751,4.58955223880597

If you can dream up the perfect story that combines young, old, technology, religion, good, bad and put it together; Broken Saints will be 1000 times better than anything you could come up with.

It is part Cyberpunk, part religious tale, part storytelling.  Truly, truly amazed.

In terms of Anime or other things that are considered different or strange;

Broken Saints is better than Akira, probably better than some of the Ghost in the Shell series.  It doesn't really compare to any hollywood stories, but it beats the story of Lord of the Rings.

Good job.  I was lucky that was able to experience this.

Anybody who gives this a bad review.  They probably didn't watch most it, have really low IQ or flat out crazy.  You can easily ignore the bad ratings, I almost listened to them and missed out on a great series.",1202860800,3,959,4.6706586826347305
2570290,2,B000FKO3RQ,"I can agree that the dialogue and writing are atrocious, voice actors despicable, themes under-wrought and trite...but there are moments, just a few moments where it almost becomes worth it.  Sometimes it becomes real ART.  But only in a few moments, and those moments are very fleeting...to o few and far in between.  Ohhh, how I wanted to like it after I really connected with it a few times.  Hassan talking to Oran...Papa Tui talking to Shandala.  I really feel transported sometimes  When the music compliments the images just right (and honestly I provide my own soundtrack sometimes out of my collection, works much better than with what they offer), and the art is beautiful, and something on the screen just clicks with what's in my head.  What's in my head is probably nostalgia.  See I used to watch this semi-animated version of Irving's The Legend of Sleepy Hollow that was semi-animated in the same way as this series.  And while I haven't seen it since I was probably six or seven, I think even that might be better than this.  There are parts that I like, and I can think of a dozen ways to make this series WORK.  Cut out the needless monologue.  It sounds like something I wrote after I flipped through Naked Lunch for the first time in 7th grade.  BE COHESIVE.  BE AUTHENTIC.  Nothing irritated me more than the Japanese themed sections.  You know...that grating ethnic music in the background that is MILES AWAY from being ANYTHING like traditional Japanese music.  Christ, would it have been that hard to drum up?  You did it (sort of) with the Arab sections!  The voice actor was simply pitiful.  Is it really that hard to try and speak with a Japanese accent?  Hell maybe even get someone who can speak Japanese and provide some subtitles.  But no...better to sound overly dramatic to the point where it just feels completely false.  And the composition, oh where to begin?!  I've seen David Lynch movies too, guys.  And guess what, he does it better than you.  You know who waxes poetic about cigarettes with references to cancer and corporations?  People who are more concerned with the thoughts of those looking at them than their own thoughts.  That's right VAIN WRITERS CONCERNED WITH HOW THEY APPEAR INSTEAD OF TRYING TO SAY SOMETHING.  Not to mention its completely laughable because the writing is just pitiful right there (I'm talking about when Raimi goes into the alley to light his cigarette).  I've gotten better profundities out of 4th graders.  This series is SCARED to actually say something.  Instead its an amalgam of re-hashed ideas stamped into the ground so hard, you can't even tell that there's an idea anymore.  I'm bashing it horribly, but only because I COULD love it.  Because I think it could really be good.  Because I think the writer could DO something if he'd (or she, I don't know) would quit TRYING so hard.  Nice try...good effort...swing and a miss.",1200268800,8,2908,4.746
2570291,5,B000FKO3RQ,"I watched these episodes at their original release on the Broken Saints website. I was impressed with their originality and artistic prestige then and am equally impressed to be able to watch any one of these episodes whenever I feel now. Also, the special feature with Brooke Burgess is well worth watching. (A+)",1196726400,,313,4.9245283018867925
2570292,5,B000FKO3RQ,"When I first started to watch Broken Saints I wasn't sure I could make it through the whole set but by the end of the first disc I was hooked in a big way!  It is brilliant  my hats off to Burgess working on a shoe string budget  he's mixed conspiracy  with religion, philosophy and mysticism and pulled off a masterpiece! Very original  Highly recommended.",1193443200,2,357,4.430769230769231
2570293,2,B000FKO3RQ,"Given the other alternatives where I could've read a good book, worked on some Xbox360 games or watched a better DVD, it was an uneventful 12 hours that I spent on Saints. Those hours felt like a marathon but without the benefits of physical exercise.

I give it 2 stars, one for the admittedly innovative way of presentation -an animated graphic novel that's delivered like a play. I actually quite enjoyed this, and think it was well executed overall. This approach also suited the thrilling/surreal atmosphere.

Another star for the dialogue, which at some points was quite captivating, but overdone at others. ALso the voice overs were great. William B Davies (ciggie man in X-Files) is recognizible, and makes a welcomed return as a bad dude.

Overdone is perhaps a word that can be used to label this 12-hours of animated fairy tale that includes everything from computer hacking, philosophy, religion, conspiracy and egg farming. At some juncture, the plot is absorbing, yet I found it at the same time to be contrived, very contrived and certainly pretentious. It pretented to have great meaning and poetry, but the effects don't reallt show.

A flaw of the plot is that it attempted to fuse so much together without given individual elements deeper assessment. It touches the surface and thats it.

The slow-moving pace of the entire story magnifies this weakness, and the audience may detect degrees of superficiality. A quick pace with more depth could have addressed this issue. Beside the innovative presentation (though the freshness wore off after a while) and the excellent (and sometimes amusing) voices overs, there wasn't anything that I was hooked on.

At times I was tempted to hit stop on the remote and do something else, but since I had already invested hours watching the first two DVD, I felt little obliged to labor through the third and forth disks to see how the ending unfolds.

And it wasn't much of an ending, I certainly anticipated more, I mean with a 12-hour build up, albeit a slow one, an in-your-face type of ending would be expected from any reasonable person. THe Saint's conclusion was bit of an anti-climax.
Buy this if you must, though I would recommend a rental or borrow.",1179619200,6,2216,4.877659574468085
2570294,3,B000FKO3RQ,"The visuals in Broken Saints are beautifully drawn but the spoken dialog does this comic epic a disservice. First, it's confusing to have both spoken dialog and subtitles / word bubbles. But second, and more importantly, the spoken voices (especially the female voices) are lightweight compared to the dark and brooding nature of the illustrations. It's like Paris Hilton reading a Stephen King audio book!",1167955200,7,406,5.2615384615384615
2570295,4,B000FKO3RQ,"I don't even know how I first heard of this. It was essentially something I just heard about but never got much detail but eventually the buzz started and I just had to find out what everyone was talking about. The series, basically done single-handedly by 3 people, ended up being an internet hit and the series ran for the better part of 2 years. Afterwards they got more funding and an expanded team to put it onto DVD. With improved animation and sound as well as voice acting, the set is a fascinating look at a project that you find easy to admire but it's hard to love since it does a couple of things wrong.

Played out like an animated graphic novel, the story centers around 4 people: Raimi, a computer programmer living in America; Shandala, an orphan being raised on an island in the South Pacific; Kamimura, a Monk in Japan and Oran, a Middle-Eastern man. Each one gets a vision of an upcoming apocalypse and its this that eventually gets them together and try to figure out what it means and if they can maybe stop it. The story is separated into roughly 24 chapters which get progressively longer and in some have more than one part.

One thing while watching the series is just how cool it felt: seeing animated characters actually move in a world (albeit with limited animation) felt for once like experiencing what I had to do in my mind when I read the Sandman, Fables or even comic books like Superman and the X-Men. The animation isn't particularly attention grabbing since it was never meant to but it sure does look...neat. Character designs and scenes look nice and small animated effects happen, some as small as a character smoking to a bit more ambitious stuff like rays, weird freaky imagery and the like. It's also a bit odd since the series was originally designed on the computer where it's easy to maybe web surf in the meantime while an episode is playing but on DVD, the series looks kind of small and low-budget looking rather than immensely detailed.

While the animation is solid and the story is incredibly intriguing, the same can not be said for the writing. Granted, it's better worded than anything I've written but it's more abstract and pretentious and it just seems too...""dictionary""-esque rather than it being natural. Lines such as ""emperors and quiet kings lay sun's egg and fry the darkness"" or ""oily teeth scrape the fetal glass of the east"" don't bring about reactions of its profundity and its depth, it's more a case of: ""....what the **** does that even mean anyway?"" It makes the beginning of the show incredibly slow since characters talk in looong soliloquies in quasi-poetic language and it just comes across as being a bothersome.

Some DVD sets are content to have commentaries on 2-3 episodes and a couple featurettes. Not so with here where anything and everything seems compiled to offer a glimpse into the making. We get featurettes on the animation production, voice acting and sound, a panel discussion, a lecture, trip to Sundance and many more, and I'm not counting audio commentary on every episode. They're spread out over the discs rather than one disc(usually the last) being packed. The one thing I should mention: sometimes the buttons wouldn't register a button press such as wanting to play an episode, instead acting like I wanted to go to the next selection while the other DVD player in the house worked. Just as a word of caution.

Also must mention the packaging: The main disc storage is similar to what you can find in the old Smallville sets with the book format rather than the opening flaps but it's what holds them that's different. A plastic cover fits the whole thing and on the corners is cardboard cutouts of the characters attached that swing back and forth. It's a neat idea for sure but it almost seems kind of flimsy and almost like you have to be super careful or you'll rip one and make the whole thing look ugly. Kudos for trying something new but like the Simpsons head packaging, a new idea does not a good idea make.

Is is a worthwhile story to get into? Absolutely, not only for the concept itself and the story but just the fun of it. If you can get past the thicker than thick writing or its limited animated presentation, you'll find a worthwhile series to get into but doesn't have that all around ""masterpiece"", more like a really cool thing.",1167436800,7,4351,4.629533678756476

Watching this series is like piecing together a puzzle. Thankfully for us jaded couch critics, it's not always predictable where the pieces will fall. The characters begin to develop more and more as the story progresses and by the end of the series, you actually care about all of them. The one character I thought was slightly underdeveloped was Kamimura, whom I still loved.

However, don't go into this expecting some kind of mindless entertainment, because you'll be disappointed. The prose and concepts are complex, but for those who persevere in the series, the rewards are there.",1163116800,5,745,4.96
2570339,5,B000FKO3RQ,"Bravo!  I just can't say enough about the award-winning epic series, Broken Saints.  The creatorz of this phenomenal show,  Brooke Burgess, Ian Kirby, and Andrew West, describe it as a ""cinematic novel"".  It was first introduced to the world solely via the internet back in 2001.  The creators, despite pouring years of blood, sweat, and tears into their work, made no financial gain.... And since it'z humble beginnings, the series has evolved into a special-edition dvd format, with a next generation console game coming out soon.  The animation itself is partially animated but primarily utilizes flash animation.  The soundtrack, as composed by Tobias Tinker and Quentin Grey with other pieces by Mozart and others, can only be described as haunting.  As opposed to the web version, the special-edtion dvd makes use of dramatic voice talents and sound effects. Again, the artwork on this show is mind-blowing and the dialogue is spell-binding.  FYI, Broken Saints is not a light-hearted cartoon.  There are a lot of complex, profound issues dealt with on this show.  And upon watching it, I think you'll agree that it is highly relevant to the age that we are living in.  All in all, Broken Saints is a must-see (at least once, although it will certainly take several more viewings for all of it to sink in) and I highly recommend it!",1162598400,11,1338,4.924107142857143

I'm sorry, but that's just awful dialouge.  The writer is obviously attempting to sound profound, but just comes off as artifical and clich&eacute;d.

The character designs are horrible as well, with disproportioned faces and bodies.

This series makes no apologies for its 12 HOURS OF ENGAGING STORYTELLING, the likes of which have never been seen before or since. Do not be fooled by overly simplistic paraphrases and summaries of its content - Broken Saints touches on nearly every relevant issue facing humankind today, and builds its foundation upon the most historic and universal archetypes, allowing it to transcend barriers of language, age or creed. Brooke Burgess weaves a tale that is so filled with undercurrent and subtext, that you will find the surface plot only barely scratches the surface of the series' intent.

I like to describe Broken Saints as a comic book in motion. Andrew West's inspired artwork is brought to life through Ian Kirby's masterful manipulation of the Flash medium. Lush canvases are created, figures are gorgeously illuminated, and the text of the story guides you through each frame, bringing you closer to the moment of understanding, when the message of Broken Saints ultimately resonates.

Bringing the emotion of the printed word to the forefront is difficult for even the greatest writer to achieve, but again, Broken Saints excels with the all-important musical contributions of Tobias Tinker. The soundtrack of this series is an emotive journey through various distinctive sonic soundscapes. It is the music of this series that brings you to the edge of your seat, and the tears to your eyes.

In its current evolution, Broken Saints is brought fully to life by the contribution of some truly phenomenal vocal talents. I challenge anyone to not be moved by Michael Dobson's portrayal of Oran, the faithful Iraqi muslim who is tormented by the choices he must make between serving God and serving his nation.

I highly recommend Broken Saints to anyone looking for material that challenges your beliefs, your politics, and your state of mind. I encourage anyone who is even remotely curious to buy this DVD, and give the series a chance. In fact, if you even had the attention span to read this far into my review, you will very likely enjoy and appreciate this set. Turn out the lights, turn up the sound, let Broken Saints wash over you. Engage it, and you will find what millions across the globe have found within...what would you give to know the truth?",1155427200,27,2465,5.034313725490196
2570343,5,B000FKO3RQ,"I was beyond stoked when I found that Broken Saints had come to DVD.  One can go on and on about the amount of work that has obviously gone into it, but more importantly is the overall message, which I wouldn't dare ruin or try to sully with my limited vocabulary.

Something like this can have a major effect on you, and I recommend it highly.",1155340800,8,344,4.196969696969697
2570344,5,B000FKO3RQ,"This series has been a part of me since it first started. I've followed the series from Chapter I in flash format and now on remastered DVD. The story is a complelling and gripping one with a plot that slowly unravels with each chapter becoming more and more exhilerating up to the climactic ending. Each chapter pulling you closer and closer to the story and each character as they learn more about themselves as well as the forces against them. Visually, the series is amazing. Text and qoutes both familiar and new from various books and historical figures flash across the screen and draw you in while the scenes and animation keep you for the ride. The musical score is beautifully fitting for each scene. Be it sweet and gentle or rough and gritty, the audio effects and musical backgrounds deliver the scene straight into full and compelling view. And with this DVD comes the all new voice narration... something the Flash version lacked but it didn't take away from the effect of the story. With these new voices it completely brings the story from it's comic book state to a level matching that of a full motion picture. BROKEN SAINTS is worth more than 5 stars... This series will keep you asking for more long after you've finished watching the last chapter. And with all the extra features and bonus material included on this exceptional 4-disc set you'll be entertained for days on end. The DVD box artwork is enough to make you want to open it and pop Disc 1 into the DVD player as soon as you look at it. For those of you who like cliffhanger endings on your television series... for those of you who love climactic and vindicative endings... for those of you who enjoy an in-depth and gripping tale... and for those of you who are open-minded to a brand new experience that will touch and affect you... buy this DVD.",1155340800,7,1832,4.588414634146342
2570345,1,B000FKO3RQ,"I had high hopes for this series when I started watching it, though I guess the nonstop obscenities should have been the tip off that under all of that visual masterwork and spiritually stunning characterizations there lurked an twisted message that wasted ten hours of my life to discover.  Shandala is truly a wonderful character, pure and good, and the characterization of her is very tender, so by episode 21 or so the storyline actually looked like it could end hopeful and uplifting.  Oh, how wrong of me to think so, because for all of the philosophical and religious trappings, the message of ""hope"" the marketers promise is that the characters learn in the end that the villain's demented plan to save the world is really more effective than their spiritualities and that the ""truth"" is that the emotional and physical torture and destruction of an innocent, good woman is the only way to save the world!  Spare me.  And if you think that I am disgusted by this message, just imagine what the Muslims will think when they see what becomes of all of that quoting of the Koran and the Muslim character's final opinions.  Although the story is technically good, I'm only giving it one star for the message of despair.",1155254400,12,1223,4.723004694835681
2570346,5,B000FKO3RQ,"I was familiar with the series but didn't really get to fully enjoy this until recently.  We did a full on ""weekendfest"" and watched it all.  We were joking about how perhaps the music was subliminally charged with messages and that is why we couldn't stop watching it! Or was it the political and evil corporate zest? I am more prone to going for the fact that it was a unique artistic delight.  An evolved comic book meets drama meets sci-fi meets art and music hmmmm? Characters in this have enough depth to them you want to get to know them more. Raimi and Kamimura were delivered deliciously.  The tie in of the four superb.  I could go with the anti Saints haters and say it was loaded with politics and opinion of corporate evildoers but everything we watch is plugging some opinion or belief.  That is the Way. This too had its opinion but as in many brands of Art, it did so with beauty and seductively captivated your mind.  It entertains you. It was great artistically. Surreal fantastic and a very entertaining piece.  Watch it for the characters, the art, and the music, driven story line and be ""entertained"".  Or put your freedom fighter gear on and become a Broken Saint and go fight for your right to get entertained Majestically!!!!  For my comics lovers, its a tasty treat*",1155081600,12,1292,4.554112554112554
2570347,5,B000FKO3RQ,"The last guy to review this was obviously paying too close attention to one aspect of the story, and therefore didn't allow himself to actually experience the story, as one needs to when watching this.

That aside, I'll admit, I do not yet own the Fox release of this fine piece of work. I've been a fan of this series for about 4-5 years now, and I bought the initial release of DVD way back when, so I'm familiar with the story, and the scope of it.

This is simply a tale of 4 ethnically diverse people, brought together by the same vision of the apocalypse. They come from different backgrounds, different faiths...and yet, they are able to coexist, to put a stop to what could have been the end of the world.

From the perspective of one who read comics as a kid, and didn't really get into the more ""heady"" issues addressed by this story, I loved it. I watched it purely from fascinations with the storytelling, and the story itself.

What it comes down to, to be fair is this: If you agree with the author's views on the more ""heady"" subjects presented in this story, you'll love it. If not, don't pay attention to that, and instead engross yourself into the addictive story and artwork instead.

You'll find, either way you look at it, this is a story worth anyone, and everyone's attention. 'Nuff said.",1154995200,13,1311,4.468619246861925
2570348,1,B000FKO3RQ,"I will say that it has great audio and tons of extras but the story is beyond contrived.

You could use it as a checklist for every movie cliche and nonsensical trite new age meme. There should be a damn entry in Guinness World Records for saturation of crappy, irrelevant poetry and the worst part of of it lies in the extra features where Director Brooke Burgess simultaneously talks of how we're being commoditized into mindless consumers(tm) and aggressively advertises himself and his sanctimonious beliefs and his less than relevant beliefs about the Iraq war being about control and fear.

Here is a little sample of the ideas he'll be cramming down your throats with all the bluntness of a mace to the skull.

Evil Corporations(tm) and Christians are using the Iraq war to control people with fear- again, about as relevant as Cher and yet somehow even more overrated.

Iraqi's ""freedom fighters"" are defending themselves from encroaching western Imperialism(tm)- about as relevant as Michael Moore but he's getting there.

I could go on and on but you get the idea- essentially its a wet dream for leftists and new age twits. It would be so much nicer if it didn't feel like he was selling his narcissistic holier-than-thou view of the world an just tried to to sell a good story.",1154908800,11,1289,4.788288288288288
2570349,5,B000FKO3RQ,"Broken Saints is an experience like none other.  Not only is the viewer presented with an artfully written story, honest-to-goodness full character development, stunning visual effects through original artwork and flash animation technology, and a truly emotive and atmospheric soundtrack, but also hours of special features that really give you a glimpse into the heart and soul of the people behind the project.

If you appreciate Shakespearian literature, and you have any sort of attention span, this series could very likely change your life, or at the very least, your point of view.",1154476800,8,589,5.32258064516129
2570350,5,B000FKO3RQ,"Broken Saints is really a piece of work to behold. I first caught some of it at Newgrounds, then picked up the original dvd at comic con last year. Man, people keep asking where comic books are going to go in the next generation. . .well, this is it.

The artwork is stunning, the voices are great and the story sucks you into it, to where you literally can't stop watching it.

If you are looking for something different, something that breaks the mold or just a good time, the new Broken Saints DVD should be yours once it drops in August.",1153872000,8,541,4.294117647058823
2570351,5,B000FKO3RQ,"I hope that some day Broken Saints will get the general acclimation it deserves.  Broken Saints transcends the normal expatiation of Corporate America and is not afraid to be true Art.

This is one of those very rare events.  Something really new that does not insult the intelligence of the viewer but instead engages you in its story.

I was also introduced to the original on-line version by a friend, and while I tend to be a purist and like the on line version better (I miss the haiku poems while the episode was loading for one thing).  I definitely recommend buying the DVD.  If nothing else to allow these very talented folks to keep creating stories for us.

Broken Saints is edgy, uncompromising and well worth supporting.  Buy it, watch it, give it to a good friend...",1152921600,6,780,4.601449275362318
2570352,5,B000FKO3RQ,"So far all of these reviews are spot on, so there's not much more that I can say. I was introduced to Broken Saints by a friend who has followed it from the very beginning, back when it was online, and let me just tell you...it's an adventure. Other forms of media i.e videogames, movies, or books have their own unique way of engrossing their audiences, but Broken Saints feels a lot like all three. It's an artistic style all it's own, and one that really needs to be appreciated. A lot of hard work and thought has gone into this story, and the creators understand that their audience is very intelligent and able to handle it, although it make take a few times watching it. But hey you get from it what you put in. Haha, i'm starting to get emotional! just go and buy it! Now!!!!

2570353,5,B000FKO3RQ,"One does not expect this calibur of work in an independant project.  You might expect good writing and maybe even some good art work.  Broken Saints delivers both with spectacular music and on a scale formerly unimagined.  This is not a 6 part mini-series spun out of a simple idea. This is an epic, a story urging to be told and Brook Burgess and his friends, dance with science and magic, Faith and Philosophy to choreograph a show that is unparalleled and not easily forgotten.

It is for a mature audience but worth all the time you invest in it.",1148601600,7,550,4.47
2570354,5,B000FKO3RQ,"I first saw the series when it was featured on Newgrounds. Newgrounds, mind you, has seen very little in this like. A den of 5 minute killfests with stickfigures, and crude sexual content; amongst such things, Broken Saints was seen as a jewel amidst the rubble. I bought the first run of the DVD, hand packed no less, after watching the first chapter. What can I say; I'm impulsvie.

It was worth it though.

12 hours of one of the best modern stories I have read, watched, or listenned to. This has it all, layer upon layer of depth. Plot twists that hit you like speeding car. Music, by Tobias Tinker, which chills your soul. So, turn out the lights, crank up the 5.1, and just dive into the world.... of Broken Saints.",1148428800,9,722,4.421052631578948
2570355,5,B000FKO3RQ,"I saw this grow from an idea into what it has become, and man alive, what a progression. Fantastic and unique storytelling that takes you on an intellectual, spiritual and emotional rollercoaster. Art that pulls you in and sets a perfectly creepy mood. And an entirly innovative use of flash, the likes of which the world had yet to see. Not to mention completely original music, done by a master that I had the unique fortune to see live. All this forges together to give one of the most unique and breathtaking experiences!!

It'll blow your mind, sweep you in and keep you there for the  conspiracy-filled ride. When all is said and done, you'll reach the end with  the satisfaction of knowing  a little more than you did before - and sleep with apocolyptic visions dancing in your brain and seeing visions of the truth flickering across your closed eyelids.

Amazing artwork, eardrum pleasing  music, and a storyline to beat all storylines..  Buy this set... it'll change the way you view the world.. and  leave your imagination open to all new ones.",1148342400,2,667,4.576271186440678
2570357,5,B000FKO3RQ,"I'm only going to say this once: This may--no, this almost definitely will-- take more than one time through.  If you're looking for a simple plot with lots of action, steer clear of this one.  This series is not, I repeat, is not, for instant gratification.  But I guarantee you, if you have patience and are willing to put your thinking cap on, this series is totally worth it.

I'll admit, when I first started this series, I was pretty skeptical.  I thought the plot was too slow-moving, the animation left to be desired, everyone was talking strangely, and, to be honest, completely boring.  However, I'm also the type of person who prefers to completely finish something before casting it aside as bad, and by the second chapter, I was hooked.  And to this day, I am thankful that I stuck through to the end.  It was worth it.

Repeat value - check!  Every time I rewatch this series, I catch something I missed before, whether a plot element, a good quote, an underlying meaning, or hell, even a nice picture I hadn't paid much attention to before.

This series may not have an official rating, but I'd recommend it for mature audiences only.  Not necessarily because of the violence, nudity, or language; more because it simply isn't easy to grasp.  Less mature (note: I don't say younger, age doesn't always necessarily factor into maturity) audiences will probably find the series boring.  Which leads me into the issue of the animation quality: while it might not be flashy, it's only purpose is to get the story across.  Honestly, I think if any more were added, it would only prove as a distraction.  Instead of worrying about how there isn't much animation, let the words sink in.  Trust me, it's better that way.

With beautiful artwork, relatable characters, outstanding voice performances, a breathtaking soundtrack, and knowing that this is how far the dream of three ordinary (but VERY dedicated) people got.  This is something that I can watch again and again and still get the same effect.  This is something that changed the way I think, provoked me, and inspired me.  This is something where I'm more than willing to shell out $40 to know the truth.  This is Broken Saints.",1148169600,4,2196,4.723684210526316
2570358,5,B000FKO3RQ,"This baby has it all, suspense, horror, tragedy, drama, comedy, action, mystery.  And I could keep going.  Broken Saints is one of my passions in life, and alongside the likes of Firefly and Donnie Darko it is at the top of my recommendations list.  Superb story (find me one better), excellently casted voice talent, and an amazing score.  I know the length turns a lot of people I know off, but I tell them to just give it time to pull them in and it always works.  It's sad to think that some people won't be able to handle it, because I think its messages are important.  This is probably gonna sound clich but I felt like a better person after I watched it the first time.  Anyway I think I'm starting to ramble.  Point is, buy this, watch this, tell your friends.

Spread the love.  Word is bond.

IF YOU'RE SENSITIVE TO BRIGHT/FLASHING. LIGHTS. TURN WAY DOWN OR DIM SCREENLIGHT

DON'T WATCH IF YOU'RE  TIRED IN ANYWAY.
Every time I begin to veiw this movie I blink and then Im back on the play dvd screen. Found out i fell asleep. Still on 1st disc had to rewatch this several times other than it being confusing at times. This time I won't watch it at night,hopefully I don't fall asleep. Im really trying to understand  this movie.
ALSO you may want to pre read up on the characters before watching the movie so you understand whats going on even though some of the stories don't match the description.if not itll appear as if most of the characters ramble.

The movie references cool quotes from comic books(the killing joke),story books,and poets to name a few that's pretty neat
It's one of those movies you have to watch over and over to understand whats going on. Prob due to the dull voice acting (specificly the main characters Shandalah,Kamu,Raymi).So far from what I seen there's somewhat more personality in the minor characters.
 SPOILER
Why dose everything cease for that one girl,kind of think that's racist,a whole village falls apart because the 1 and only pale girl has night terrors and gets a fever. Shandalah is not a priestess or a god just someone not from that island.",1482019200,,1356,4.757446808510639
