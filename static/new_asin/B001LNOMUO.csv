3688269,2,B001LNOMUO,Caught again with a poor pcture poorly packaged and presented. Boring and almost as tired as I felt watching it. Dvd given to a charity shop.,1356825600,2,141,4.461538461538462
3688270,3,B001LNOMUO,If you can hang in there and watch it till the end....the ending is worth it and makes sense of it all.  A small thumbs up.,1326931200,5,123,3.730769230769231
8318912,4,B001LNOMUO,"This is a hard to find early production from Hammer Studios. There are no monsters or vampires to be found, but some nice eerie touches can still be seen. Some rather slow, deliberate pacing works against this film, but if you like old whodunits and you don't suffer from ADD, this film is well worth your time.",1487894400,,311,4.473684210526316
8318913,1,B001LNOMUO,Wasn't able to watch. Don't know if it is the age of the film or watch but the playback quality was very poor and then it stopped altogether.,1447200000,,141,4.071428571428571
8318914,1,B001LNOMUO,THE MOVIE ITSELF DID NOT WIRK PROPERLY  IT HAD SECTIONS WITH NO VOICES AND SECTIONS OF THE MOVIE THAT YOU COULDNT WATCH BECSUSE OF THE POOR FILM QUALITY,1444176000,,152,4.428571428571429
8318915,5,B001LNOMUO,Great Movie,1442188800,,11,5.0
8318916,3,B001LNOMUO,It was okay,1439769600,,11,3.0
8318917,4,B001LNOMUO,"In spite of poor quality of movie's print,this is very entertaining. Loved Hugh Griffiths butler. The master of the house refuses to let step-daughter marry,leaving him to fend for himself. He's confined to a wheelchair,or is he really?Hold on to your hat as the exciting climax approaches.",1421020800,2,290,5.191489361702128
8318918,5,B001LNOMUO,Good movie,1420416000,,10,4.5
8318919,4,B001LNOMUO,"If you are in the mood for an old spooky house mystery, this is a good one. Some good twists and turns. Only one brief scene has a man with a bit if blood on his shirt so it's not an early slasher film. I hate those. This is a good creepy who done it/spooky house/Sherlock Holmes sort of detective/pretty girl sleuth type of film. Good old fashioned entertainment just right for a rainy night. The only dissapointment I had was at the ending. I saw two points which they could have made a change that would have made all the difference in the world. It would have been a much better ending but as you will see, they obviously wanted to make sequels and so something we were all waiting for at the end failed to happen. Also I feel that if the killer would have been done in by his own style of killing, that would have been great. Oh well, still a nice little film!",1361145600,6,865,4.154761904761905
8318920,4,B001LNOMUO,Valentine dyall's velvet tones are great in this old british creaker. The dark English countryside is suitably foreboding and i love Julia Lang as Miss Frayle. Ok the picture and sound are not the best but this is a rare film and if you love these OLD DARK HOUSE MYSTERIES then this is a must BUY.,1359331200,5,297,4.321428571428571
