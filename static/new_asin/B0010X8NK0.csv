3053603,4,B0010X8NK0,"If the story wasn't so hard to follow I would be able to say that I got into this more. Usually when it comes to anime movies I enjoy the story or the mystery, something is always going on, here we get a lot of fighting and what feels like a mix of things all ready done before. I too was thinking of Hellsing from the moment I saw the box and while it's different it doesn't stand out on its own enough to take my breath away.

The colors, animation and music were pretty good, I mean it's an enjoyable series but it's nothing that is sitting in the back of my mind thinking about what I just saw. Since I got this free thorough the Vine program I find it easier to be little less critical but if I spend my hard earned money I would probably rate it lower.

Vampires have been done in so many medias and genres, this isn't terribly mundane but it doesn't really stand out. Seems like the Black Brothers was made with so many layers to make it interesting that it took something away from being more enjoyable.",1205884800,,1011,4.153061224489796
3053604,4,B0010X8NK0,"Well, this series greatly grew on me. The first episode, which appeared to be all angst and slapstick violence, was not indicative of the overall tone of the few episodes in this single disc grouping.

Tons of plot, lots of layers to things. REALLY strange mixing of styles of animation. Some I really loved, some not so much. But the characters are wonderfully filled out, even if I find at least one to be an embarrasment.

I noticed, after seeing the show, that there is actually a lot of informatiomn about the show online. But the overall juxtaposition is what gives this its weight.

The only major Special Features are some hilarious (and in my case un-listenable) Commentaries. All four episodes have the same style. Really over the top Japanese Pop style. Overltly cutsey and childish. I made it through about 3 minutes max of any of them. There might be a lot of good information, but I'll never know since the presentation is tough for the American psyche to process.

The fact I alternated this show with Princess Tutu (freakin' brilliant show that doesn't get enough credit) sort of showed off the weaknesses this show has. Magical realism is a tough nut to crack. Here gavity of all sorts seem to be ignored inconsistently.

But I will be honest, for all my quibbles, I know I am going to see more if it. The setup is strong enough to get you hooked. You actually care about the main characters and want to see how all this turns out.",1205798400,,1448,4.575289575289576
3053605,5,B0010X8NK0,"Like all good anime, Black Blood Brothers starts right in the middle of the action, not giving quite enough information to understand that first scene.  Gradually, as this first DVD unfolds, bits and pieces of the missing story fill in, showing main characters who are flawed but powerful, and overshadowed by a violent past.  The only ones who are untouched by those dark times are the children.

The story is familiar in its general terms, but the characters are distinct individuals with powerful pasts.  By the time the first DVD finishes, I'm addicted, plain and simple.

The art is clear and beautiful, and the DVD quality is fantastic.",1205625600,,642,4.907407407407407
3053606,5,B0010X8NK0,"Yeah, I know it might shock some of you, but I actually enjoyed BBB more than the other two vampire Japanese animes Trinity Blood and Hellsing. BBB packs the punch, and reminded me of Chrono Crusade or even Inuyasa, what with Jiro behaving like Inuyasa, the fun interaction between the characters or the way how Jiro is a Kin Killer of his race like Alucard from Hellsing. Sure, BBB has similarities from the three, but it holds its own and brings some fresh new looks to the genre and now stands as my second favorite anime (first being Ragnarok the Animation, third being Fullmetal Alchemist).
Black Blood Brothers was original written as a short manga series by Khei Azano, than in 2006 Group TAC and Studio Live produced the manga into a short anime series. The manga series hadn't ended yet, as of now, but the show did with only 12 episodes, shorter than Hellsing by 1. But while Hellsing is a bit sinister and ""goryliscious,"" Black Blood Brothers mixes humor and a close-knitted relationship that gives more backbone to the story than just killing one vampire after another. While Alucard is lustful for blood and relishing in killing, Jiro is protective of his little ""brother,"" Kotaro Mochizuki (who bares a similar personality and appearance as his dead vampire lover, Alice Eve) while trying to kill off the Kowloon Bloodline as The Silver Blade.
The plot of BBB is to kill the remaining Kowloon Children that are descended from the Kowloon King of the Hong Kong Crusade that took place in Japan. The Silver Blade killed the Kowloon King and became known for his skill around the world. After the war ended, about ten years, Jiro leaves the safe, secluded home of the Dark Princess and her older brother Crow to the snowy north to Japan with his younger brother, Kotaro, to live in The Special Zone, a home made for vampires after the Hong Kong Crusade for them to live in peace. But they soon find out that The Special Zone isn't all what its cracked up to be. But before that, Jiro is greeted by a Compromiser, a person who is the ""peace-maker,"" between the vampires and humans and helps vampires get into the Special Zone as well as finding them a place to stay there.
Behind all this is the main plot, the friend that betrayed Jiro and Alice is planning on getting into the Special Zone as well. And when she arrives she will do whatever she can to get what she wants.
This is a nice anime series and a good companion for your anime collection. If you enjoy vampire anime series but don't want one that is too gory and mind boggling, mixed with some good old humor and lighthearted family love, than you will enjoy Black Blood Brothers. But this series isn't for children under the age or thirteen.",1221004800,,2713,4.584362139917696
3053607,2,B0010X8NK0,"I must admit I haven't heard of Black Blood Brothers, despite having the whole Hellsing and Trinity Blood collection, until it appeared on my Amazon Vine mail. It's a little more juvenile than the aforementioned two despite stylized violence. Also, the characters are not quite as interesting and comes off as a little shallow. It may be argued that character development do take several episodes but from the first few episodes, the introduction didn't pique my curiosity to make me want to get the succeeding collections.

Another thing, all of my above comments would've been made irrelevant if the animation was in the league of Ghost In The Shell or Naruto. But it's quite stilted and ordinary similar to those disposable anime/toy tie ins. Better wait for this on your cable channel, if it does make it.",1219276800,,809,4.905109489051095
3053608,4,B0010X8NK0,"The first two episodes of this series really had me turned off right away. The story was slow, confusing and lacked real direction. Getting past this initial set up though, audience members are going to find a vampire series that moves towards the innovative. With characters that you can't pigeon hole into the `typical' mold, this series allows them to sprinkle just enough plot hooks within these first four episodes to keep the audience wondering what their stories are and where they are going to go next. I don't know where this series is trying to go ultimately but at this moment, I'm happy to go along with them to find out. Recommended.",1215648000,,646,4.725663716814159
3053609,4,B0010X8NK0,"This series gets off to a mediocre start with a pretty lousy intro song, which led my (Japanese) wife to comment, ""Anime music hasn't really evolved much over the years, has it?"" Don't know how this song got accepted, it's horribly mixed and the casually sung lead vocals don't in any way match the heavy metal music in the background (way in the background).

Fortunately the anime itself is a big improvement. The characters and settings are very well drawn, and the story is reasonably paced, with the entrance of the protagonist -- red cloaked vampire extraordinaire Jiro -- suitably dramatic. We're given enough back story to set the tone and hook us in to this mysterious figure, and he's plunged right into a raging battle between vampires trying to break into the ""special zone"" (an area where they are free to live alongside humans) and the armed forces of the ""Coffin Company"" who enforce immigration and who are trying to keep them out. Meanwhile, his sidekicks are his younger brother vampire and a young woman who works as a ""Compromiser"" for the Company, part of a kind of conflict-mediation group that seeks to  to build harmony between the red bloods (humans) and black bloods (vampires).

The tone is pretty appropriate as a dystopia or black utopia, the fight scenes are suitably cool and dramatic, and the hero suitably flashy, so -- alongside the excellent quality of the animation and backing music (barring the opening song) -- I have to give this series a thumbs up. It reminds me a bit of Chrono Crusade, and I think fans of that series should like this one. BTW -- we watched this in Japanese w/English subtitles, which is really the way it should be done, in my humble opinion, so I can't comment on the English overdubbing. The Japanese voices are excellent, as usual.

The outro song is much better than the intro, and interestingly seems to be sung in Japanese, Korean and English. Ever notice how outro songs are mellow and reflective, as opposed to the uppity intros?",1212278400,,1998,4.749279538904899
3053610,5,B0010X8NK0,"After watching the rather disappointing xxxHolic for Amazon Vine, I was a little leery of this one, wondering if it was going to be yet another mediocre attempt. While I'm not quite the anime snob some people are, I can be picky and tough to please. Good thing I wasn't disappointed! Black Blood Brothers was fun enough that I'm going to pick up the other two disks.

The setting was sort of Vampire Hunter D meets the 21st century (for good reasons). I liked the various ""flavors"" of vampire in the worldbuilding process, and also the human agencies set up to deal with them. The storyline itself also caught my attention, and I ended each episode wanting to know what happened next.

However, what I really liked best was the characters. Neither flat nor predictable, they really stood out in this series as individuals. Personality quirks and mannerisms were believable and entertaining, and I found myself really liking them as I watched. They were well-animated as well, always a plus, since I wasn't distracted by poor animation quality.

Overall, this is a good one. Maybe not one of the absolute best ever (though I'll want to watch the rest of the series before I make that decision for good), but one that I'll definitely want to watch again.",1212278400,,1252,4.73394495412844
3053611,5,B0010X8NK0,"I love anime that boasts incredible ainmation and plot. Black Blood Brothers delivers very well in those two departments. Everything is wonderfully drawn and the voices are nicely done for an english dub. It may be a dark anime, but they fit humor in at appropriate moments. Both me and a friend watched this DVD and the second volume and enjoyed it. We are anxiously awaiting the release of the third and final volume. I would advise this series to anyone who loves vampires, romance or fighting.",1208563200,,497,4.724137931034483
3053612,3,B0010X8NK0,"I enjoy anime, though I'm admittedly not an expert in the genre by far. Sometimes anime, especially the episodic variety, can be a bit cheesy, and Black Blood Brothers definitely has its moments. But once I got into the story, it definitely held my interest, and the story of Mochizuki, the ""Silver Blade,"" and his little brother Kotaro, was a fun little adventure. I did find the flashbacks a bit disorienting at times because it wasn't always very clear as to what we were supposed to be learning from the flashback (which is the sole purpose of a flashback, to learn relevant info applicable to the present day situation), but overall this twist on the tried and true vampire tale left me not only fairly satisfied with the outcome of Chapter 1 in the tale, but also reminded me of another classic anime series from my childhood, Speed Racer, due to the style of humor peppered through the tale.

If you're into anime adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously, then give this DVD a try.

3053613,2,B0010X8NK0,"This is a very average anime movie. The animation is average, the storyline is average (and borderline boring), and the characters have average interest to them. The movie would be a good interests to anime fans that like vampires but to those that could care less about them, this is a boring movie.",1207612800,,300,4.679245283018868
3053614,4,B0010X8NK0,"this turned out to be an interesting take on vampire legends.  From the beginning vampires had lived among humans, for the most part secretly and peacefully because being bitten by a vampire neither turned a human into one nor automatically resulted in death, though it had other side effects.  To become a vampire a human had to drink a vampire's blood.  (It is unclear whether vampires can reproduce in any other way though there are suggestions that they can.)

As sentient beings seemingly must, vampires divide themselves by ""bloodlines"", essentially their vampiric line of descent.  Since differing bloodlines convey different powers and weaknesses, this makes a certain amount of sense; however, it appears that some level of aristocratic idiocy has crept in as well.  Thus one of the worst fates for a vampire is to be descended from a ""broken"" or unknown bloodline; it is a virtual guarantee of suspicion and ostracism.

One of the sounder reasons for this and the catalyst for the Hong Kong Crusade ten years ago, which made the existence of vampires known to humans, was the emergence of a new bloodline, the Kowloon, which is HIGHLY contagious.  Bitten humans turn into vampires, and even bitten vampires have their bloodlines ""turned"", resulting in an ever increasing tide of Kowloon vampires.  In the crisis humans and ""normal"" vampires fought side by side to exterminate the Kowloon bloodline, and at the end the story was put out that ALL vampires had been destroyed, when in fact the ""normal"" vampire survivors had merely gone back into hiding in one or more ""special zones"" with the help of a small group of humans ""in the know"".

So as our story opens one of the heroes of that war along with his younger brother have stowed away on a ship bound for Japan and the Yokohama ""special zone"".  Unfortunately, another group of vampire refugees has chosen the same ship and is being desperately pursued by a human ""vampire suppression"" team because of intelligence that a surviving Kowloon vampire is among them.  The four episodes on this DVD cover the story of what results up to the point where the survivors enter the ""special zone"".

Though it is clearly of TV rather than movie or even OAV quality, I liked the animation.  It is somewhat limited, but not noticeably cheap to my eyes.  I do wish Jiro would lose the stupid hat, though!  One thing worth noting in order to reduce confusion: every episode opens with a flashback to some past event before continuing the present story.  There is also a nice mix of tragedy and comedy, especially between the two leads, Jiro and Mimiko, the Compromiser.

The commentary tracks are DEFINITELY worth listening to, despite being in Japanese with subtitles, for two reasons.  First, one of the commentators is the original creator who while careful not to reveal what is coming manages to clear up several small questions viewers might have missed.  Second, you couldn't ask for a better illustration of the axiom, ""Don't drink and commentate!""  The author shows up with a full bottle of wine (red of course) and the two voice actresses proceed to get plastered in the course of recording the four episodes of commentary.  One hopes that the commentary tracks on future DVD's were recorded separately as the girls who were calling for another bottle of wine by the fourth episode would clearly be passed out drunk at this rate.

3053615,5,B0010X8NK0,"This is episode 1 of a series, so if you get hooked, following the adventures of the BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS could get expensive.  However, if you're into anime and manga -- and vampires -- you'll probably enjoy this one a lot.  It has a lot of mood, comedy, and violence.

Jiro and Kotaro are brothers, and the story that's presently being unveiled goes back ten years.  The series makes the most of time-hopping through the different phases of the story, a particular artform the Japanese storytellers do well most of the time, but the cuts back and forth in these episodes can lose an unwary watcher along the way every so often.  I sometimes had to roll the DVD back a ways and watch again to figure out WHEN I was.  But the adventure is fun and the usual props -- confusing female character and brotherly rivalry -- are in place.

I liked the concept of the vampires and humans having to join together against even more dangerous vampires. I hadn't seen that one done before, although there have been some interesting blends of vampires and werewolves lately.  And the action will keep most viewers glued to the seat till the final moments of the film spin through.

Parents need to be aware that this isn't a program for kids.  BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS gets very graphic when it comes to the violence, and some of the dialogue can be rough and a little racy.

Overall, the art in the movie is pretty good.  There's a sense of another world, and the mood is definitely affected by what is shown on the program.  I'm going to pick up the rest of the series to see how everything turns out because the storyline has my attention.",1206576000,4,1625,4.48639455782313
3053616,4,B0010X8NK0,"I'm not a huge fan of anime, but I do like vampires. And I've certainly seen worse vampire movies/shows than this series.  I don't know that I would pay $25 for the DVD, but the story was enjoyable and the characters were likeable.  There's nothing truly groundbreaking here, but the story moves along quickly and smoothly, and actually left me interested in viewing the rest of the series.",1206576000,,390,4.720588235294118
3053617,4,B0010X8NK0,"This is a pretty decent series however the quality of the animation is a letdown.  The characters are interesting and the concept is well thought out.  The episodes have a cliffhanger format which makes them feel short.  Overall, its far from being the best vampire themed anime but its still entertaining.",1206576000,,306,4.96078431372549
3053618,4,B0010X8NK0,This was a great movie if you like anime and vampires. The plot was really good and had lots of twists. My favorite character was Mimiko. She was nice. Jiro's little brother was cute and funny. The animation was moderately good but the characters' costumes were really unusual.,1206316800,,277,4.791666666666667
3053619,3,B0010X8NK0,"Watching the first episode of Black Blood Brothers is like experiencing a drug-induced seizure - there's a lot of thrashing around, you don't know what's going on, and it just isn't the enjoyable experience you probably expected. Basically, it is just one over-powered scenario after another with no explanation or backstory provided. In later episodes, viewers will find out about the different vampire bloodlines, the susceptibility of the main character to certain substances, and about the human-vampire alliance.. but not in the first episode.

For those that get through the first episode and enjoyed the artistry enough to give the series another chance, the storyline does improve and explanations are eventually provided. I enjoyed the rest of the DVD enough to want to see the entire series, but I wasn't as enthralled with it as have been with other anime favorites.

Make sure to check out the Commentary in the extras section - I received a number of large chuckles from it, especially when the creator started drinking. You certainly wouldn't find this sort of thing on a traditional American release. :)",1206230400,,1118,5.137362637362638
3053620,5,B0010X8NK0,In my opinion this is the first good vampire anime in a while. Black Blood Brothers adds some interesting new twists to the vampire genre such as vampires and humans fighting along side each other during the war against the koolon Children and the fact that getting bit by a vampire is a intensly plesurable experiance. I really like the interesting angle this series takes toward vampires and I would highly recomend it.,1206144000,,421,4.780821917808219
3053621,4,B0010X8NK0,"I'm not a huge fan of anime (my knowledge of it is pretty much Speed Racer and Gatchaman), but I wanted to give this a try. The storyline is a battle against the vampires thing (like Blade), but the story is much deeper than that. While the storyline it tells comes to a partial conclusion, there are still many plot threads left open for the next chapters that follow. Also, since this deals with vampires there are a number of scenes that get fairly bloody, so this isn't necessarily for the kids. Still, the characters are interesting and there's definitely enough action to keep you watching and even wanting more when it's finished.",1206057600,,637,4.646017699115045
3053622,4,B0010X8NK0,"I've only seen these first four episodes, but what I've seen suggests a very paint-by-the-numbers series.  You have the serious, skilled main character with an occasionally silly demeanor, leading lady that trashes said character for being a pervert, other plucky comic relief, and even the starter-arc bad guy.  If you're in the mood for one of those artsy series that break anime conventions, then go watch 12 Kingdoms.

If, however, you just want a thrill ride to go with your popcorn, you could do far worse than Black Blood Brothers (so far as I can tell).  While cliches are a mile a minute, the execution is notable.  First, the series does a good job of running several continuities in time side by side.  This keeps a good level of suspense as viewers try to understand how these continuities are ordered and blend into each other.  THe characters are also at least likable instances of anime cliches.  The action while not superlative, is also stylish.  Besides the off-putting opening music, the OST also fits the action quite well.

Looking at the above paragraph, I get the feeling that the reviewer would think I enjoyed this first volume less than I actually did.  Somehow, it comes to more than the sum of its parts; perhaps it's because the job is already doing a good job of establishing the rules of its world and its particular brand of vampire.

I'll register one personal complaint.  I've often felt that the use of vampirism as an analogue for sexuality to be somewhat cheesy and strained.  Unfortunately, that motif is in full force here- no doubt to satisfy the viewers looking for fanservice.

Minus that one complaint, the series has serious potential and reminds me of the fun that I had with Getbackers and Busou Renkin.  Recommended.",1205971200,,1763,4.807308970099668
3053623,4,B0010X8NK0,"I'm going to be upfront about this: I hate vampire shows.  HATE them!  I don't know why, but there's something about vampire shows that rub me the wrong way.  I remember growing up loving the classic ""Dracula"" with Bela Legosi, but since then vampires slipped off the radar for me.  Particularly since modern day vampires want to play by their own rules (doing Matrix-like stunts), yet at the time they seem stuck in the past (can't come out in sunlight, hate garlic, etc).  And yes, this means I don't care for ""Hellsing"" much, despite the fact that it's one of the more critically acclaimed animes out there.  So this brings us to ""Black Blood,"" a series I had heard about because of it's unique (initial) distribution, but not much else beyond that.

Needless to say, I was very, VERY surprised!

Despite my bad history with vampire shows, ""Black Blood"" is something I greatly enjoyed.  Strangely enough, I'm really trying to figure out why.  It's re-inventing the vampire mythos, but not greatly.  The action is good, so maybe that's part of it.  The characters are likable (or, in the case of one character, very unlikable...but he's/she's the bad guy/girl).  The animation is certainly good.  Truth be told, it reminds me a lot of ""Trigun"" is the character designs and fluidness of the action scenes.  Or maybe it's just a little of everything.  Here is a show that is not revolutionary.  Chances are you might not watch it more then once.  It certainly isn't deep by any means.

I think, ultimately, what this boils down to is the fact that it's a well made show.  It won't rock your world and it doesn't break any new ground, but it's fun while it lasts.  Plus it's interesting enough to make you want to finish it, which certainly isn't a bad thing by any stretch.  Just to top it all off, if your an anime fan short on money, three disks will get you the whole series, which is always a plus.",1205971200,,1902,4.56508875739645
3053624,4,B0010X8NK0,"Not being a huge anime or vampire fan, this was a bit of a stretch for me, although not without its merits. The art was good by comparison with some of the stuff I grew up with (Speed Racer, Gigantor, original Battle Tech, etc.), however, I have seen better (at least to my tastes - Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop).

Recognizing that this was the first chapter, I gave the story line a lot of leeway, understanding that they would need to do some setup for the main characters and story lines (always a tricky thing, watch the first Star Trek movie to see just how boring this can be if done badly). That in mind, however, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and smoothly the characters were introduced (not without its hitches though, I thought Kotaro, the younger brother was a girl for the first few minutes <g>), by the third episode I felt reasonably up to speed and was starting to enjoy the story progression.

Personally, I felt the pseudo-sexual Stoker-ish bite sequence was a touch over the top, especially if the story is targeted to be adolescent fare, but enjoyed the light humor of most of the story. Bottom line is that I think you really need to be a fan of this series or subject matter to make this a must have, otherwise there is enough better product in the genre to make this a second choice, even with its endearing qualities.

3053625,3,B0010X8NK0,"Black Blood Brothers is a Japanese anime that has nice production and above average animation but suffers from an incredibly convoluted plot that brings the whole thing to the point of being nonsensical.

There are four episodes on this disc and like I said, the animation is quite nice. It looks as good as just about any other decent anime out there and uses a cool mix of CG and hand drawn elements to create this world where vampires seem to make up the majority of living beings. Action scenes are fine and bring to mind the film Blade with the amount of vamps dispatched. The DVD looks very nice and presents the episodes crisp and clear. There is also the option to watch the episodes in Japanese with English subtitles, which is always a plus. There are also commentaries on each of the episodes also with English subtitles which is a welcome addition.

I really wasn't crazy about the story. It was hard to follow and introduces so many characters that it was difficult to tell who was who and what their relations were in most cases. Still, it held my interest slightly throughout and made me curious about how the story will develop in future episodes. There isn't any over the top violence or overt sexuality, so I guess I could recommend it on the grounds of kiddie entertainment.",1205884800,,1293,4.593073593073593

The fact I alternated this show with Princess Tutu (freakin' brilliant show that doesn't get enough credit) sort of showed off the weaknesses this show has. Magical realism is a tough nut to crack. Here gavity of all sorts seem to be ignored inconsistently.

But I will be honest, for all my quibbles, I know I am going to see more if it. The setup is strong enough to get you hooked. You actually care about the main characters and want to see how all this turns out.",1205798400,,1448,4.575289575289576

Gradually, as this first DVD unfolds, bits and pieces of the missing story fill in, showing main characters who are flawed but powerful, and overshadowed by a violent past.  The only ones who are untouched by those dark times are the children.

The story is familiar in its general terms, but the characters are distinct individuals with powerful pasts.  By the time the first DVD finishes, I'm addicted, plain and simple.

3288103,5,B0010X8NK0,"Yeah, I know it might shock some of you, but I actually enjoyed BBB more than the other two vampire Japanese animes Trinity Blood and Hellsing. BBB packs the punch, and reminded me of Chrono Crusade or even Inuyasa, what with Jiro behaving like Inuyasa, the fun interaction between the characters or the way how Jiro is a Kin Killer of his race like Alucard from Hellsing. Sure, BBB has similarities from the three, but it holds its own and brings some fresh new looks to the genre and now stands as my second favorite anime (first being Ragnarok the Animation, third being Fullmetal Alchemist).
Black Blood Brothers was original written as a short manga series by Khei Azano, than in 2006 Group TAC and Studio Live produced the manga into a short anime series. The manga series hadn't ended yet, as of now, but the show did with only 12 episodes, shorter than Hellsing by 1. But while Hellsing is a bit sinister and ""goryliscious,"" Black Blood Brothers mixes humor and a close-knitted relationship that gives more backbone to the story than just killing one vampire after another. While Alucard is lustful for blood and relishing in killing, Jiro is protective of his little ""brother,"" Kotaro Mochizuki (who bares a similar personality and appearance as his dead vampire lover, Alice Eve) while trying to kill off the Kowloon Bloodline as The Silver Blade.
The plot of BBB is to kill the remaining Kowloon Children that are descended from the Kowloon King of the Hong Kong Crusade that took place in Japan. The Silver Blade killed the Kowloon King and became known for his skill around the world. After the war ended, about ten years, Jiro leaves the safe, secluded home of the Dark Princess and her older brother Crow to the snowy north to Japan with his younger brother, Kotaro, to live in The Special Zone, a home made for vampires after the Hong Kong Crusade for them to live in peace. But they soon find out that The Special Zone isn't all what its cracked up to be. But before that, Jiro is greeted by a Compromiser, a person who is the ""peace-maker,"" between the vampires and humans and helps vampires get into the Special Zone as well as finding them a place to stay there.
Behind all this is the main plot, the friend that betrayed Jiro and Alice is planning on getting into the Special Zone as well. And when she arrives she will do whatever she can to get what she wants.
This is a nice anime series and a good companion for your anime collection. If you enjoy vampire anime series but don't want one that is too gory and mind boggling, mixed with some good old humor and lighthearted family love, than you will enjoy Black Blood Brothers. But this series isn't for children under the age or thirteen.",1221004800,,2713,4.584362139917696

It's a little more juvenile than the aforementioned two despite stylized violence. Also, the characters are not quite as interesting and comes off as a little shallow. It may be argued that character development do take several episodes but from the first few episodes, the introduction didn't pique my curiosity to make me want to get the succeeding collections.

Another thing, all of my above comments would've been made irrelevant if the animation was in the league of Ghost In The Shell or Naruto. But it's quite stilted and ordinary similar to those disposable anime/toy tie ins. Better wait for this on your cable channel, if it does make it.",1219276800,,809,4.905109489051095

Getting past this initial set up though, audience members are going to find a vampire series that moves towards the innovative. With characters that you can't pigeon hole into the `typical' mold, this series allows them to sprinkle just enough plot hooks within these first four episodes to keep the audience wondering what their stories are and where they are going to go next. I don't know where this series is trying to go ultimately but at this moment, I'm happy to go along with them to find out. Recommended.",1215648000,,646,4.725663716814159
3288106,4,B0010X8NK0,"This series gets off to a mediocre start with a pretty lousy intro song, which led my (Japanese) wife to comment, ""Anime music hasn't really evolved much over the years, has it?"" Don't know how this song got accepted, it's horribly mixed and the casually sung lead vocals don't in any way match the heavy metal music in the background (way in the background).

Fortunately the anime itself is a big improvement. The characters and settings are very well drawn, and the story is reasonably paced, with the entrance of the protagonist -- red cloaked vampire extraordinaire Jiro -- suitably dramatic. We're given enough back story to set the tone and hook us in to this mysterious figure, and he's plunged right into a raging battle between vampires trying to break into the ""special zone"" (an area where they are free to live alongside humans) and the armed forces of the ""Coffin Company"" who enforce immigration and who are trying to keep them out. Meanwhile, his sidekicks are his younger brother vampire and a young woman who works as a ""Compromiser"" for the Company, part of a kind of conflict-mediation group that seeks to  to build harmony between the red bloods (humans) and black bloods (vampires).

The tone is pretty appropriate as a dystopia or black utopia, the fight scenes are suitably cool and dramatic, and the hero suitably flashy, so -- alongside the excellent quality of the animation and backing music (barring the opening song) -- I have to give this series a thumbs up. It reminds me a bit of Chrono Crusade, and I think fans of that series should like this one. BTW -- we watched this in Japanese w/English subtitles, which is really the way it should be done, in my humble opinion, so I can't comment on the English overdubbing. The Japanese voices are excellent, as usual.

The outro song is much better than the intro, and interestingly seems to be sung in Japanese, Korean and English. Ever notice how outro songs are mellow and reflective, as opposed to the uppity intros?",1212278400,,1998,4.749279538904899
3288107,5,B0010X8NK0,"After watching the rather disappointing xxxHolic for Amazon Vine, I was a little leery of this one, wondering if it was going to be yet another mediocre attempt. While I'm not quite the anime snob some people are, I can be picky and tough to please. Good thing I wasn't disappointed! Black Blood Brothers was fun enough that I'm going to pick up the other two disks.

The setting was sort of Vampire Hunter D meets the 21st century (for good reasons). I liked the various ""flavors"" of vampire in the worldbuilding process, and also the human agencies set up to deal with them. The storyline itself also caught my attention, and I ended each episode wanting to know what happened next.

However, what I really liked best was the characters. Neither flat nor predictable, they really stood out in this series as individuals. Personality quirks and mannerisms were believable and entertaining, and I found myself really liking them as I watched. They were well-animated as well, always a plus, since I wasn't distracted by poor animation quality.

Overall, this is a good one. Maybe not one of the absolute best ever (though I'll want to watch the rest of the series before I make that decision for good), but one that I'll definitely want to watch again.",1212278400,,1252,4.73394495412844

3288109,3,B0010X8NK0,"I enjoy anime, though I'm admittedly not an expert in the genre by far. Sometimes anime, especially the episodic variety, can be a bit cheesy, and Black Blood Brothers definitely has its moments. But once I got into the story, it definitely held my interest, and the story of Mochizuki, the ""Silver Blade,"" and his little brother Kotaro, was a fun little adventure. I did find the flashbacks a bit disorienting at times because it wasn't always very clear as to what we were supposed to be learning from the flashback (which is the sole purpose of a flashback, to learn relevant info applicable to the present day situation), but overall this twist on the tried and true vampire tale left me not only fairly satisfied with the outcome of Chapter 1 in the tale, but also reminded me of another classic anime series from my childhood, Speed Racer, due to the style of humor peppered through the tale.

If you're into anime adventure that doesn't take itself too seriously, then give this DVD a try.

3288111,4,B0010X8NK0,"this turned out to be an interesting take on vampire legends.  From the beginning vampires had lived among humans, for the most part secretly and peacefully because being bitten by a vampire neither turned a human into one nor automatically resulted in death, though it had other side effects.  To become a vampire a human had to drink a vampire's blood.  (It is unclear whether vampires can reproduce in any other way though there are suggestions that they can.)

As sentient beings seemingly must, vampires divide themselves by ""bloodlines"", essentially their vampiric line of descent.  Since differing bloodlines convey different powers and weaknesses, this makes a certain amount of sense; however, it appears that some level of aristocratic idiocy has crept in as well.  Thus one of the worst fates for a vampire is to be descended from a ""broken"" or unknown bloodline; it is a virtual guarantee of suspicion and ostracism.

One of the sounder reasons for this and the catalyst for the Hong Kong Crusade ten years ago, which made the existence of vampires known to humans, was the emergence of a new bloodline, the Kowloon, which is HIGHLY contagious.  Bitten humans turn into vampires, and even bitten vampires have their bloodlines ""turned"", resulting in an ever increasing tide of Kowloon vampires.  In the crisis humans and ""normal"" vampires fought side by side to exterminate the Kowloon bloodline, and at the end the story was put out that ALL vampires had been destroyed, when in fact the ""normal"" vampire survivors had merely gone back into hiding in one or more ""special zones"" with the help of a small group of humans ""in the know"".

So as our story opens one of the heroes of that war along with his younger brother have stowed away on a ship bound for Japan and the Yokohama ""special zone"".  Unfortunately, another group of vampire refugees has chosen the same ship and is being desperately pursued by a human ""vampire suppression"" team because of intelligence that a surviving Kowloon vampire is among them.  The four episodes on this DVD cover the story of what results up to the point where the survivors enter the ""special zone"".

Though it is clearly of TV rather than movie or even OAV quality, I liked the animation.  It is somewhat limited, but not noticeably cheap to my eyes.  I do wish Jiro would lose the stupid hat, though!  One thing worth noting in order to reduce confusion: every episode opens with a flashback to some past event before continuing the present story.  There is also a nice mix of tragedy and comedy, especially between the two leads, Jiro and Mimiko, the Compromiser.

The commentary tracks are DEFINITELY worth listening to, despite being in Japanese with subtitles, for two reasons.  First, one of the commentators is the original creator who while careful not to reveal what is coming manages to clear up several small questions viewers might have missed.  Second, you couldn't ask for a better illustration of the axiom, ""Don't drink and commentate!""  The author shows up with a full bottle of wine (red of course) and the two voice actresses proceed to get plastered in the course of recording the four episodes of commentary.  One hopes that the commentary tracks on future DVD's were recorded separately as the girls who were calling for another bottle of wine by the fourth episode would clearly be passed out drunk at this rate.

3288112,5,B0010X8NK0,"This is episode 1 of a series, so if you get hooked, following the adventures of the BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS could get expensive.  However, if you're into anime and manga -- and vampires -- you'll probably enjoy this one a lot.  It has a lot of mood, comedy, and violence.

Jiro and Kotaro are brothers, and the story that's presently being unveiled goes back ten years.  The series makes the most of time-hopping through the different phases of the story, a particular artform the Japanese storytellers do well most of the time, but the cuts back and forth in these episodes can lose an unwary watcher along the way every so often.  I sometimes had to roll the DVD back a ways and watch again to figure out WHEN I was.  But the adventure is fun and the usual props -- confusing female character and brotherly rivalry -- are in place.

I liked the concept of the vampires and humans having to join together against even more dangerous vampires. I hadn't seen that one done before, although there have been some interesting blends of vampires and werewolves lately.  And the action will keep most viewers glued to the seat till the final moments of the film spin through.

Parents need to be aware that this isn't a program for kids.  BLACK BLOOD BROTHERS gets very graphic when it comes to the violence, and some of the dialogue can be rough and a little racy.

Overall, the art in the movie is pretty good.  There's a sense of another world, and the mood is definitely affected by what is shown on the program.

Basically, it is just one over-powered scenario after another with no explanation or backstory provided. In later episodes, viewers will find out about the different vampire bloodlines, the susceptibility of the main character to certain substances, and about the human-vampire alliance.. but not in the first episode.

For those that get through the first episode and enjoyed the artistry enough to give the series another chance, the storyline does improve and explanations are eventually provided. I enjoyed the rest of the DVD enough to want to see the entire series, but I wasn't as enthralled with it as have been with other anime favorites.

Black Blood Brothers adds some interesting new twists to the vampire genre such as vampires and humans fighting along side each other during the war against the koolon Children and the fact that getting bit by a vampire is a intensly plesurable experiance.

While the storyline it tells comes to a partial conclusion, there are still many plot threads left open for the next chapters that follow. Also, since this deals with vampires there are a number of scenes that get fairly bloody, so this isn't necessarily for the kids.

3288119,4,B0010X8NK0,"I've only seen these first four episodes, but what I've seen suggests a very paint-by-the-numbers series.  You have the serious, skilled main character with an occasionally silly demeanor, leading lady that trashes said character for being a pervert, other plucky comic relief, and even the starter-arc bad guy.  If you're in the mood for one of those artsy series that break anime conventions, then go watch 12 Kingdoms.

If, however, you just want a thrill ride to go with your popcorn, you could do far worse than Black Blood Brothers (so far as I can tell).  While cliches are a mile a minute, the execution is notable.  First, the series does a good job of running several continuities in time side by side.  This keeps a good level of suspense as viewers try to understand how these continuities are ordered and blend into each other.  THe characters are also at least likable instances of anime cliches.  The action while not superlative, is also stylish.  Besides the off-putting opening music, the OST also fits the action quite well.

Looking at the above paragraph, I get the feeling that the reviewer would think I enjoyed this first volume less than I actually did.  Somehow, it comes to more than the sum of its parts; perhaps it's because the job is already doing a good job of establishing the rules of its world and its particular brand of vampire.

I'll register one personal complaint.  I've often felt that the use of vampirism as an analogue for sexuality to be somewhat cheesy and strained.  Unfortunately, that motif is in full force here- no doubt to satisfy the viewers looking for fanservice.

Minus that one complaint, the series has serious potential and reminds me of the fun that I had with Getbackers and Busou Renkin.  Recommended.",1205971200,,1763,4.807308970099668
3288120,4,B0010X8NK0,"I'm going to be upfront about this: I hate vampire shows.  HATE them!  I don't know why, but there's something about vampire shows that rub me the wrong way.  I remember growing up loving the classic ""Dracula"" with Bela Legosi, but since then vampires slipped off the radar for me.  Particularly since modern day vampires want to play by their own rules (doing Matrix-like stunts), yet at the time they seem stuck in the past (can't come out in sunlight, hate garlic, etc).  And yes, this means I don't care for ""Hellsing"" much, despite the fact that it's one of the more critically acclaimed animes out there.  So this brings us to ""Black Blood,"" a series I had heard about because of it's unique (initial) distribution, but not much else beyond that.

Needless to say, I was very, VERY surprised!

Despite my bad history with vampire shows, ""Black Blood"" is something I greatly enjoyed.  Strangely enough, I'm really trying to figure out why.  It's re-inventing the vampire mythos, but not greatly.  The action is good, so maybe that's part of it.  The characters are likable (or, in the case of one character, very unlikable...but he's/she's the bad guy/girl).  The animation is certainly good.  Truth be told, it reminds me a lot of ""Trigun"" is the character designs and fluidness of the action scenes.  Or maybe it's just a little of everything.  Here is a show that is not revolutionary.  Chances are you might not watch it more then once.  It certainly isn't deep by any means.

I think, ultimately, what this boils down to is the fact that it's a well made show.  It won't rock your world and it doesn't break any new ground, but it's fun while it lasts.  Plus it's interesting enough to make you want to finish it, which certainly isn't a bad thing by any stretch.

The art was good by comparison with some of the stuff I grew up with (Speed Racer, Gigantor, original Battle Tech, etc.), however, I have seen better (at least to my tastes - Ghost in the Shell, Cowboy Bebop).

Recognizing that this was the first chapter, I gave the story line a lot of leeway, understanding that they would need to do some setup for the main characters and story lines (always a tricky thing, watch the first Star Trek movie to see just how boring this can be if done badly). That in mind, however, I was pleasantly surprised at how quickly and smoothly the characters were introduced (not without its hitches though, I thought Kotaro, the younger brother was a girl for the first few minutes <g>), by the third episode I felt reasonably up to speed and was starting to enjoy the story progression.

Personally, I felt the pseudo-sexual Stoker-ish bite sequence was a touch over the top, especially if the story is targeted to be adolescent fare, but enjoyed the light humor of most of the story. Bottom line is that I think you really need to be a fan of this series or subject matter to make this a must have, otherwise there is enough better product in the genre to make this a second choice, even with its endearing qualities.

There are four episodes on this disc and like I said, the animation is quite nice. It looks as good as just about any other decent anime out there and uses a cool mix of CG and hand drawn elements to create this world where vampires seem to make up the majority of living beings. Action scenes are fine and bring to mind the film Blade with the amount of vamps dispatched. The DVD looks very nice and presents the episodes crisp and clear. There is also the option to watch the episodes in Japanese with English subtitles, which is always a plus. There are also commentaries on each of the episodes also with English subtitles which is a welcome addition.

Blacks and Reds fought against the Kowloon for an ultimate showdown in Hong Kong, referred to as the Hong Kong Crusade.

As this series begins, Silver Sword travels with his young brother, Kotaro, to the Special Zone, a protected city set up in the aftermath of the Hong Kong Crusade. The first disc sees the pair caught in the middle of an ambush by government troops on Kowloon Children, their meeting up with Mimiko, a human negotiator of sorts used in vampire and human negotiations, and their first battle with Kowloon Children.

Silver Sword is not unlike Vampire Hunter D in that he possesses the cool and quiet demeanor.  An he certainly draws comparisons to other such anime vampires/vampire hunters.

8239097,4,B0010X8NK0,"Vampire anime is nothing new . . . and Black Blood Brothers falls somewhere in the middle of it all.  Based in a world where vampires and humans live mostly in peace, that peace is broken when virulent new breed of vampires emerges, called the Kowloon Children.  These vampires, unlike the others in the Black Blood world, create new vampires simply by biting a human and thus either tend to procreate rapidly or kill violently.  It was thought that these Kowloon children were wiped out ten years prior to the start of this story--but now the trouble may be starting again.  Reenter the ""Silver blade"", Jiro Mochizuki, a vampire warrior from ten years prior now on a journey to the special zone in Hong Kong with his younger brother, Kotaro.  The two become caught up in the vampire/human war once more as it becomes evident that the Kowloon children are on the rise and Jiro must use his old skills to keep his brother safe...

Overall, this anime is . . . mediocre.  The style of the anime is bright and vivid, with good graphics and action, but the storyline is nothing particularly innovative.  It is neither the violent blood fest of something like Hellsing, nor is it the moodier and reflective style of the bittersweet Vampire Princess Miyu.  There is some violence, combined with scenes that alternate between action, touches of humor and moody drama.  The overall result is something that is more appealing to the audience that enjoys relationship anime rather than those looking for lots of action and violence. Each episode starts with a flashback that hints at things not yet explained, and then jumps into the action.  Jiro and Kotaro inadvertently stow away on a boat that is the stage for a clash between a group of vampires and the human Suppression Team.  Jiro and Kotaro wind up going overboard--and it's up to Mimiko Katsusagi, a young woman working as a mediator between sides, to help the brothers when Jiro walks to shore.  Mimiko manages to smooth things over, until the Suppression team shows up again seeking Kowloon vampires.  Jiro and Mimiko find themselves awkward allies against gun-toting humans and super-deadly vampires.  Jiro is an odd mix of wild clothing, mystery and tragedy with a touch of human and all the manners of a gentleman.  His back story is only beginning to be laid out in the first disk of this series, and viewers will have to watch the rest of the disks to get the full story on him.  He is perhaps the most interesting character of this anime and doesn't fall into the trap of being too full of angst to act when needed. His younger brother, a curly blond haired, blued eyed little child is nothing like Jiro--other than having pointy fangs.  He doesn't seem to be a true vampire yet and he is by turns cute and charming and extremely annoying.  The relationship between Jiro and his Kotaro is puzzling.  Jiro seems determined to protect his brother at all costs, yet willing to engage in casual violence to punish his brother when he becomes too annoying.  For instance, at the introduction to both characters, Kotaro is busily banging on Jiro's coffin and endlessly trying to get his brother to wake.  It's unsurprising that Jiro is annoyed, but the way he casually smacks his brother into the floor with considerable force is unnerving.  Obviously being a vampire boy, Kotaro isn't badly hurt, but the implied violence against a child by the hero is just a bit hard to put aside--and isn't really that funny to this viewer.  The female lead, Mimiko routinely acts as an intermediary and helps vampires get settled in the secure zone.  Her character provides humor and some romantic tension in the storyline, with a potential for expansion in the future. Overall, Mimiko can be a bit silly in her reactions, but they're not over the top for the style of the anime.

The action moves fairly quickly on this disk, so there are no long scenes of background building and emotional stillness--the characters keep the plot moving forward.  The audience for this particular story is likely the preteen and teen audience, rather than the more adult crowd--although it is difficult to anticipate where this anime may go in future disks.  Even though this is not the most original anime, it manages to present a cohesive and action-filled story with some interesting subplots.  The artwork is decent and easy to watch, and for someone who enjoys anime series with a vampire theme, this isn't a bad way to pass a few hours in an afternoon with some popcorn and soda. Viewers who get hooked may want to look into getting the later disks to find out more about the brothers' past and what will happen to them in the future--as well as seeing if the tentative romantic tension continues.  Viewers who like this may also want to check out the Night Walker anime series about a vampire investigator who takes on the things that go bump in the night.

Happy Viewing! ^_^ Shanshad",1231027200,,4917,4.729191090269636
8239098,4,B0010X8NK0,"This is a solid piece of genre fiction likely to appeal primarily to people who are already fans of vampire anime (like, say, Hellsing). There's some character development here--not precisely deep, but intriguing enough to keep you going, with balance between angsty Jiro and the more devil-may-care Kotaro. Animation is decent with pretty good attention to detail, though personally I am a bit put off by Jiro's wardrobe (a little too outlandish for my tastes; the hat!). The story includes a nice blend of humor, too, to keep things from getting too dark.

Those unfamiliar with anime need to be aware that this is not for children, in spite of the youth of one of the protagonists. Violence and suggested sexuality may not be appropriate for younger viewers. Teens should fare well.

Potential purchasers also need to pay attention to the words ""Chapter 1"" in the title and realize that there's no closure here. One plus for those who don't want to invest their life's savings finding closure is that the entire series is relatively short, told in 12 episodes. But though this is a financial plus, some reviewers have complained that the story in whole feels rushed and unsatisfying. If you have any reason to believe that you'll want to watch the whole series, the box set which supersedes these individual volumes is your better value.",1230940800,,1340,4.898678414096916
8239099,2,B0010X8NK0,"This is another anime that has a good concept and material but surrenders its promise to the constraints of self-censorship to qualify as a kids movie. The idea of having a mutant race of child vampires disrupting the current order of things is a promising one, which could even be taken in some sexually explicit interesting directions, yet because of the producers' inhibitions and maybe also because of societal taboos, legal and otherwise, we the viewers lose out with a bland version of what might have been. This is a good example of why censorship is so insidious and destructive. Let parents decide what their children can watch, but allow a free market in expression so the more seasoned art connoisseurs can enjoy true art that is beautiful, ground-breaking and innovative, not rendered impotent and sterile for a narrow audience.",1227052800,,840,5.007142857142857
8239100,4,B0010X8NK0,"Chapter 1 of the Black Blood Brothers introduces us to this new anime in which vampires and humans work together to stop a family of stronger, mutant vampires. With moments of gore and even occassionally racy language, we watch how the Mochizuki brothers and Mimiko combat the resurgency of the Kowloon children and develop as individuals as they deal with these powerful vampires coming back to the planet.

Overall I found this entertaining, if not stereotypical, anime. The violence and action kept me watching it, the archetypes of characters remaining compelling interests as they grow away from the human relationships into more... vampire ones? It's a strangely intriguing show and worth watching, to at least get a chance to see whether you like it. I did.",1226102400,,764,5.063492063492063
