2000349,5,B0001GWBOG,"No Baby Einstein can rival this DVD when it comes to keeping my son's attention. The vocals on this DVD are truly outstanding. When my son received this as a gift, I was concerned that the songs would be irritating, grating or annoying, especially since I anticipated listening to then numerous times over the course of his youth. To my delight, the lead vocalist's voice is pure, clean and absolutely beautiful. The children's voices that join on the choruses are simple and unobtrusive, while still capturing my son's attention.

As the mother of an incredibly busy 12-month-old little boy, I have found this DVD invaluable for times when we need to sit together and calm down before bedtime or naptime. If he gets overtired, or too keyed up, I pop in the Praise Baby DVD and we sit and sing together. The beautiful vocals, fun and calm images on the screen are able to hold his attention while worshiping our Creator.",1105747200,6,920,4.714285714285714
2000350,2,B0001GWBOG,"I bought the Praise Baby DVD and was very disappointed in the content.  I was expecting music that would keep my baby's attention, but the DVD was actually slow and boring.  While some of the visuals were interesting, I dind't feel like the video was very educational although I liked the Christian aspect.  However I have found some better Christian products in the market.",1102896000,2,374,4.8125
2000351,5,B0001GWBOG,I have been playing this DVD for my daughter since she was a couple months old. It set the stage perfectly for relaxing and peaceful feedings. Now that she is 5 months old it is very familiar and soothing to her. The music is uplifting and she loves the images. I have found her giggling at things on the screen often! I highly recommend this as a worthwhile DVD that you can feel good about letting your children watch. I am excited to get the newest release!,1096416000,5,460,4.2988505747126435
2000352,5,B0001GWBOG,"I bought this DVD about a week ago. My 15 month old daughter and I love it. It is a great way to introduce your child to worship while stimulating her mind with colors, numbers, animals and other children playing. My daughter will stay fixed to the screen the entire 30 minutes. She sways from side to side and lifts her hands as she hums along. I recomend this 100% and I am eagerly awaiting the next release.",1092355200,2,410,4.269230769230769
2000353,5,B0001GWBOG,"I bought this DVD for my daughter when she was about 4 months old, and it has definitely been one of the best investments I've made on her behalf.  She absolutely LOVES it!  The music is gentle and soothing.  I don't think it's ever failed to calm her when she's been fussy. Plus, I love singing  along with the music...it has many of my favorite choruses and hymns.  (One of the neat features is that it can be played with just children singing, an adult and children singing, or just instrumental.)  I think this Praise Baby video is produced just as well or better than its 'secular' counterparts.  We have lots of similar DVD's for our baby, but this one is by far her favorite as well as mine!  We're anxiously waiting for the next DVD in the collection.",1090281600,,759,4.410071942446043

2000355,5,B0001GWBOG,"This is a wonderful dvd for children with relaxing, beautifully sung music that is a great switch from the average children's dvd that can be annoying to adults nearby.  It has a great calming effect on children as well as caregivers with Christian lyrics and simple grachics. I heard it first in our church's nursery... LOVE IT!!!",1080691200,10,331,4.807017543859649

2000378,5,B0001GWBOG,"I have two children- ages 2 and 4- and they LOVE the Praise Baby DVD's. I was first introduced to them in our church nursery and haven't looked back since. The music is calming and enjoyable, not like some other childrens DVD's or CD's that are obnoxious and annoying for parents. My oldest child has special needs and thoroughly enjoys listening to the calm nature of this DVD and watching the basic and colorful pictures. I highly recommend all of the Praise Baby DVDs.",1476144000,2,471,4.619047619047619

2000412,5,B0001GWBOG,"Seriously... my kids can't get enough of the Praise Baby series.  My almost 1 year old is simply mesmerized and giggles gleefully whenever we turn on this video.  Even my 4 and 2 year olds will sit and watch this video in its entirety.  As an adult, I think the random video montage clips are boring, but I guess to a kid, looking at something for 10 seconds and then looking at something else for another 10 seconds is pretty cool... hehe. I will put this on while I am finishing up making dinner or doing dishes and not once have I minded listening and singing along. HIGHLY recommend this whole series.",1418774400,,605,4.383928571428571

2000429,5,B0001GWBOG,"We love Praise Baby. Our son started watching them around 5-6 months old and still loves them at 2.  The changing images are mesmerizing and really helped his vocabulary. We would name all the objects and animals as they came up.  The music is soothing and not at all cheesy like most other children's DVDs.  Most of all, we love that he's filling his little mind with worship music!",1403827200,,383,4.521739130434782

My two year old loves it and will sit calmly watching or reading books while he listens to the songs. The added bonus is I like the songs too, and it's great to start the morning with it to help us both praise God together first thing. I'm not much of a morning person, so this lifts my spirit and mood and helps me start the day off right.",1399680000,,466,3.9680851063829787

I recently discovered the setting to have it only be children's voices on the DVD and my little guy enjoys it MUCH more.

We have often had little ones (age 1 to 5) get into little squabbling times . . . putting on these DVDs draws them to watch and have their spirits ministered to, their squabbles ending.  Must admit I enjoy the music as background as well!  We  have a set of three DVDs and enjoy them all about equally.

Whenever my 7 mo old baby gets tired and fussy, and nothing else seems to soothe him, I put the Praise Baby dvd in, and my baby stops crying right away.  He loves the babies, animals, shapes, and colors!  He will often smile throughout the dvd and the music soothes him so much, that he actually falls asleep.  The Praise Baby collection seems to be the only dvds that soothe my baby when he is tired.  He is completely enamored by it, and it makes him fall asleep every time.  I'm telling you, this is the best dvd out there for babies and it is inspiring and uplifting at the same time.  Absolutely love it!",1365292800,,656,4.327868852459017

2000482,5,B0001GWBOG,"I think it is important to start this review by saying that we do not allow any battery toys or any television watching with the exception of this Praise Baby video. So, to allow our son (19 months) to watch a television in the first place is pretty huge and speaks volumes about how much we like this series. A friend of mine bought these and put it on while our sons played together one day. He was interested, but not glued to the TV, which is a plus to me; I don't want him glued to a TV. He remembered it weeks later when she put it on again, and she allowed us to borrow it. Now, he asks to sing the songs, sometimes with the video on and other times without the video. My heart smiles that he says, ""Holy! Holy! Holy!"" and wants to sing the songs. Most of the time, he just listens to it while he plays. He glances over every now and again and will watch it for about a minute and then go back to his toys. He even sings along with it (as well as any 19 month can sing along to music, that is) while he plays. This is a wonderful way to introduce beautifully sung Christian music to your children without having them become brain dead staring at a television.",1333670400,,1166,4.073913043478261

2000498,5,B0001GWBOG,"I was at my friend's house for dinner and my 6 month old was being fussy. She suggested I lay my daughter in her baby's swing and she would put on a ""Praise Baby"" video. My daughter immediately calmed down and just starred at the screen. When I got home I searched amamzon and found a copy for myself. I have used it numerous times when my daughter is being clingy to keep her occupied when I need to get something done. Again, instantly, her attention is drawn to the screen and she just watches in amazement. More recently, when she was sick and feeling miserable, she was whining and fidgety because she couldn't get comfortable, even while being held (she is 9 months now). Again, she stopped what she was doing and just watched the video. It provided at least 30 mins of peace for the entire family! I forgot to mention, my 3 year son also likes this video...not as much as my baby, but he does like it too. I recommend this video to everyone I know that has a baby and finds that they need to come up with some distraction for their child while they get things done.",1293926400,,1072,4.285714285714286

2000503,4,B0001GWBOG,"The DVD is for a gift, so I did not view it, but the merchandise came within just a few days, as advertised.",1239667200,,108,3.739130434782609
2000504,5,B0001GWBOG,"Son asks for this one (Blue Praise Baby, please).  We enjoy all of the series.  Athough we do not even have cable or have any type of television reception we do play videos/dvds for our son. The tv is in our bedroom so is only on a an occassional basis.  I like this series espcially for going to sleep or relaxing when teething or ill.  We snuggle and I verbalize what he is seeing.  He laughs and smiles, relaxes and goes to sleep.  The music is soothing and we adults enjoy it too!",1224979200,,484,4.150537634408602
2000515,5,B0001GWBOG,"My 11 month old just received this from her aunt and LOVES is.  As soon as she hears the 1st song, she knows it's her DVD and will watch the entire 30 min.  She reaches her hands out, smiles, dances and ""sings"" to the video.  It's very engaging, and even my 3 year old likes it too!  I'll definitely be buying this for baby gifts...these are some of my favorite songs too!",1219536000,,372,4.125
2000516,5,B0001GWBOG,"I absolutely couldn't have lived without this movie. My mom got it for me for my first born and my daughter watched it all the time. She was just mesmerized by it! I got her a Baby Einstein movie one time and even though she was just still a baby she gave me this look that was like ""is this a joke, i'm not watching this"" She didn't last 2 minutes into it. Praise baby however will be watched entirely. When my son was born he couldn't be parted from it either and by that time a 2nd one had come out so we at least had variety at that point. 3 years later I have a new baby again and even though we are now on our 2nd copy because of extensive use it has been worth every penny. She is watching it right now and can't take her eyes off of it. I'm so excited that there are 2 new ones that I can get now!",1209945600,,805,3.7976190476190474
2000517,5,B0001GWBOG,"We bought this for our baby due in June.  But I can it was a great purchase because even my husband and I were mesmerized! (sp?)
THe music is so pleasant and soft, and they were all songs we recognized from church.  The scenes on the video are very colorful and bright and even educational in some ways!  We definitely plan to get more!  A great alternative to Baby Einstein",1199145600,,374,4.3
2000518,5,B0001GWBOG,"This DVD was received as a gift when my second daughter was a baby.  She grew to love it and still enjoys it at the age of 4.  Now however, her younger sister is the one who is constantly asking for ""Praise Baby"".  I was delighted to discover this is not the only DVD of the collection as well.  Perhaps, having had this one the longest, and listening to my daughers sing the songs, it is my favourite.  Most of the songs are commonly sung worship tunes.
I highly recommend this DVD, especially if your child/children have a love of music and singing.",1198972800,,551,4.310679611650485
2000519,5,B0001GWBOG,"We LOVE this whole series of DVD's.  Our 13 month-old son never watches TV at home, but on long car trips, these are life savers!  The music is beautiful and soothing and the images are great.  He loves the ""real"" pictures of children, animals, and nature scenes.  We received the ""God of Wonders"" as a gift, and have since purchased the other two.  These are a great alternative to the Einstein videos if you want Christian music along with the videos.",1151280000,,453,4.54320987654321
2000520,5,B0001GWBOG,"Our five month old has been watching this DVD since he was 2 1/2 months old.  He loves this ""show"" and is glued to the screen for the entire DVD!  This is a superior DVD and great for his age range.  The ""show"" starts right away (as opposed to Baby Einstein DVDs with ""commercials"" and plugs for Disney)...so if he's cranky it helps that images (and the music) appear on the screen quickly.  The DVD is produced so that the screen is never blank - there is always one image morphing into another.  This really seems to hold his attention.  The music is continuous and is very uplifting.

We are completely satisfied with this DVD and are really quiet amazed at how well it holds our baby's attention.  We look forward to purchasing other DVDs in the PB collection.",1143072000,,764,4.446043165467626
2000521,5,B0001GWBOG,We have 2 videos from this collection and my son loves them both. I love them too - the music is wonderful! So it's a win-win all the way around!,1141862400,,145,3.8666666666666667
2000522,5,B0001GWBOG,"I have an 18 month old boy and a 3 year old girl.  This is the video I put in when I want to rest and cuddle with my son - it is very calming and peaceful, and he seems captivated by it.  My daughter had always enjoyed it as well, and now sings along with many of the songs.  While I would agree with some reviewers who say that the images aren't directly educational or necessarily related to the music like some other dvds out there, that doesn't bother me.  I like that the images aren't as fast paced as some of the Baby Einstein shows, and I especially like the fact that my children are learning some of the praise songs we sing in church.  Also, the vocals and instrumentals don't drive me nuts like much of the music that is geared for children - I actually enjoy hearing it in the background and singing along with it!",1133827200,3,827,4.14375
2000523,5,B0001GWBOG,"I'm happy to correct Henry III - PraiseBaby DVDs are *not* learning development tools. They never claim to be. But since day 1 (I speak figuratively) my son Kenny - since two months old and well on up to his current fourteen months - has been enraptured with the colours and the children and the music and the animals of the PraiseBaby DVDs. They're doing what's ultimately important in the lives of our children - instilling a passion for God's creation and by extension a passion for God himself. As important as learning development is, it's a moot point if a child is not learning about our Saviour, which is taught in every PraiseBaby DVD. My Kenny takes a PraiseBaby DVD over Baby Einstein any day of the week and I'm glad of it.",1132272000,22,735,4.492537313432836
2000524,1,B0001GWBOG,"I got this video thinking it would be like the baby faith videos with fun and creative elements for learning development. My baby watched about two mintues and was gone. I think this is pitched as a baby video but it's really more geared toward older children. None of the elements have anything to do with the music, making is virtually useless as a learning development product. I give it a big ""thumbs down"". Try any one of the baby faith products like God Made Me, God Made Music and God Made Animals. They're awesome!",1130976000,4,522,4.505263157894737
2000535,5,B0001GWBOG,"I have been showing this video to my children since my son was 6 months old and my daughter was 5 years old.  It has a very calming affect on him.  I love the video because they are praise songs that I can sing along with, which he also gets a kick out of.  You really can not do the same with the classical music that you find in most childrens videos.",1130284800,,353,3.875
2000536,5,B0001GWBOG,My daughter is 9 1/2 months old and she LOVES this DVD.  I have been showing it to her since she was about 3 months old and she has just recently started taking an interest in it.  When the opening song comes on she flaps her arms and squeals with delight.  It's also great because when shes cranky right before bedtime I can put it on and it makes her so happy.  I've asked for tht other 2 DVDs for Christmas!,1129939200,,410,4.0246913580246915
2000537,5,B0001GWBOG,My 18 month old loves this video.  She received it as a gift for her 1 yr birthday and it is the only video that she will watch.  The music is beautiful and keeps her entertained.  My 4 year old son also will sit and watch it with his sister and he sings along with the songs.  Would highly recommend!,1129507200,,301,3.966666666666667
2000538,5,B0001GWBOG,"Our one month old loves this DVD. She has the Baby Einstein Symphony DVD and it doesn't hold her attention like this video. I keep the Praise Baby CD in the car which works wonders. I have watched the DVD with her and found the video clips to be great, my husband even enjoys playing the CD when the baby isn't in the car. This collection is amazing and very well done!",1127779200,,369,4.138888888888889
2000539,5,B0001GWBOG,"My son is 16 months and has loved these videos since he was a few months old.  The praise music with its soothing and uplifting message not only fascinates him but also anyone else sitting with him.  I had a lady in my home recently who stopped to watch with him and I just prayed that the message of God's love would sink in for her, too.  I can't think of something I would rather my son watch than these and the Baby Faith videos - to stimulate his mind and spirit.  I recommend them to everyone!",1127001600,,499,4.11340206185567
2000540,5,B0001GWBOG,"My 5 month old and my 3 1/2 year old just love this series of videos. They find them very entertaining. My 3 1/2 year old asks to watch it quite often. He loves the music and has learned the words to each of the songs. This is important to me because of the Christian messages contained in the lyrics. I like the option of changing the narrators voice to adult or child. The video also shows children of different ethnicity and children with disabilities,this I feel is very important because it has prompted my 3 1/2 year old to ask many important questions. No, they are not as professionally made as the Baby Einstein videos, however I feel the message of the music and the visuals used are more important than the quality. I highly recommend this series of videos.",1125964800,,768,4.453900709219858
2000541,3,B0001GWBOG,"I wish I would have gotten this DVD sooner, as I know it would have mesmerized my daughter when she was 3-6 months old (as did Baby Mozart and Baby Bach).  Now (10 months) she prefers videos with puppet interaction - adores, for example, Baby Faith ""God Made Music"".  Still, this is an excellent tool for quiet down time, early mornings (when Mom really needs to drink her coffee), or just uplifting background music while she plays with her toys.  Well done, well thought out, well presented.",1123977600,2,493,4.64367816091954
2000542,5,B0001GWBOG,My 5 month old is so captivated by this video!  We watch it or just listen to at least once a day.  The music is wonderful and even has the option of listening to a children's chourus or an adult female singer (both are very pleasing to the ear).  We've tried many of the Baby Einstein videos and my daugther just wasn't interested but the moment I put in Praises & Smiles she is immediately drawn right to the tv.  I like to use it as a time for the 2 of us to bond & snuggle.,1114560000,,477,3.88659793814433
2000543,5,B0001GWBOG,"My son is only 5 months, and this video brings things out in him I didn't know he had!  He gets SO excited to watch this...he slaps his knees in his bouncer.  The child version you can choose for songs is really nice.  I highly HIGHLY recommend this.  I love it and so does my son.  It's a great way to start building on a Christian foundation.",1110153600,4,344,4.074626865671642
2000544,4,B0001GWBOG,"Loving this DVD!  I picked it up for my 18 month old daughter awhile ago, and finally sat down and watched it last month.  She cuddled up in my lap, leaned her head back, and just watched the show, while I snuggled her and sang.  My girl is a sweet angel (aren't they all?), but she is NOT a cuddler!

She kept pointing to the visuals, particularly the babies and children and asking me something in her gobbledy-gook language, and we had a grand time just sitting, listening, singing, talking, and spending time together while praising God.  Couldn't ask for a better moment in life!

We now watch it several times a week, particularly when she's too wound up and it's time to settle down for bed, and I get the same reaction every time.

Now, while I love the visuals (simple, clean, fun) and the music (great vocalist...nice backing kid's choir and music...none of it gets on my nerves)...the video has little to offer of direct instructional value (ala Baby Einstein, or Baby Faith's God Made Me, etc).

However, as it shows children playing joyfully and matches that to great praise music aimed at the very young, I'm very pleased with the purchase, and will be looking forward to the next edition joining our collection!",1106524800,10,1226,4.643518518518518
