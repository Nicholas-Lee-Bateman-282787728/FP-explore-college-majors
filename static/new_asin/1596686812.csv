7799759,5,1596686812,"I have been spinning for many years, and purchased this DVD with the idea that I might add to my knowledge of fleeces and spinning.  The wealth of knowledge in this DVD makes it a ""must"" for any spinner, no matter how experienced.  MacKenzie takes much of the mystery out of buying fleeces, washing them and preparing them for spinning.  Then she also gives us a primer on spinning the fiber from those fleeces.  I will be watching this DVD many times.  Bravo for a wonderful sheep/fleece/fiber experience!",1425600000,3,506,4.704545454545454
