5316979,5,B009D004MC,"People will argue the value and meaning of these three films forever, so instead I'm going to focus on the Criterion Collection DVD set ""The Qatsi Trilogy"".

1) The prints look better. The MGM DVD prints looked really good, but these DVDs look even better. In particular, the opening sequence of ""Koyannisqatsi"" is so perfect that it takes away a bit from my original experience of the film. On previous viewings, I couldn't grasp the scale of each cave shot, so I didn't know if I was looking at the side of a cliff or a tiny cave painting. That loss of a frame of reference was very important to my interpretation of the rest of the movie. Unfortunately (or fortunately?), the picture is so clear on this print that I can see the grain in the rock and can instantly ascertain the scale. Clarity takes away a bit for me, but the tradeoff is that the entire film looks stunning.

I've never seen ""Powwaqatsi"" in a bad print, and this one doesn't disappoint. And ""Naqoyqatsi"" finally looks OK, though there is still some stretching in aspect ratios, but at least it's part of the director's intent.

2) There are more extras than on the MGM DVDs, including rough pre-Glass cuts of ""Koyannisqatsi""  and a long overdue interview with Ron Fricke, the guy with the camera. For ""Qatsi"" fans, this stuff is golden.

Worth every penny. Give your old MGM DVDs to someone who hasn't seen these films.",1355961600,23,1390,4.588709677419355
5316980,5,B009D004MC,"One of the most fascinating and also important American fillmmaker of experimental documentary films, Godfrey Reggio will be known as the creator of the Qatsi Trilogy.  Three films that were taken from the Hopi language, ""Koyaanisqatsi"" (which translates to ""Unbalanced Life"" and created back in 1982), ""Powaqqatsi""  (which translates to ""Life in Transition"" and created back in 1988) and ""Naqoyatsi"" (which translates to ""Life as War"" and released in 2002) are films that are meant for one to watch and give their own interpretation.

And now all three films will be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of The Criterion Collection in December 2012.

It's important to note that these films are without dialogue, they are in essence films of visual poetry and everyone will have their own interpretation.  These are films that are meant to be experienced and truthfully, going into summaries about these three films will make this film seem weak by reading it, as the purpose of these films are mean to be visual.  But I will give my interpretation of these three films in my judgment call section.

So, we start with the filmmaker.  Godfrey Reggio is one of the most intriguing filmmakers who may not be as well-known as commercial Hollywood filmmakers but he is a person who has given back to the community.  The Co-founder of La Clinica de la Gente, the facility provided medical care to 12,000 community members in Santa Fe.  He started up ""La Gente"", a community organizing project in Northern New Mexico's barrios.  In 1963, he co-founded Young Citizens for Action, a community organization to aid juveniles who may have gotten themselves into trouble due to becoming part of a street gang.  In 1972, he co-founded the Institute for Regional Education in Santa Fe, a non-profit foundation.

From his work for various political causes, as well as working with the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the Institute for Regional Education (IRE) in the early '70s in creating public awareness of New Mexico's invasions of privacy and the use of technology to control behavior, this is where he would meet cinematographer and editor Ron Fricke (""Chronos"", ""Baraka"", ""Samsara"") and together, these two would collaborate on a film titled ""Koyaanisqatsi"" which brought in another collaborator, musician Philip Glass (""The Truman Show"", ""The Hours"", ""The Illusionist""and ""Secret Window""), who Reggio would work with on all three films.

The first film ""Koyaanisqatsi"" is a Reggio's most well-known film that is not only a cult film but also a soundtrack by Phillip Glass that was well-known.  The film impressed many people including filmmaker Francis Ford Coppola who wanted to help by allowing Reggio to use his name and to help present and distribute the film.  Nearly two decades later ""Koyaanisqatsi"" was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"".

Despite the popularity of the film, due to legal and contractual rights issues, the film has been out of print for for nearly two decades until was released on DVD in 2001 by MGM Home Entertainment.  And a decade later, the remastered Blu-ray and DVD of ""Koyaanisqatsi"" and his two sequels was released by The Criterion Collection.

""Koyaanisqatsi"" began in 1975 and because of budget constraints, Godrey Reggio along with cinematographer Ron Fricke felt it was best to shoot with 35 mm film.  The film is without dialogue was a collaborative effort between Reggio and Fricke who traveled to various cities with no script but just capturing what they felt looked good and using experimentation such as time-lapse footage for their film but also using double exposure but for the most part, keeping the footage from looking ""gimmicky"", which Fricke wanted to stay away from.

One can watching ""Koyannisqatsi"" and see various footage of man-made technology but what has technology done for people at the time?  Destroy the environment?  Made people to dependent on technology?  Perhaps the meaning of ""Koyaanisqatsi"" is best to describe this film as ""life disintegrating"".

The second film featured in the trilogy is ""Powaqqatsi"".  If the first film was how man was dependent on technology, the second film moves away from technology and focuses on the conflicts in third world countries as people are dependent on traditional ways of living, while others become modernized through industrialization.  And is true to the film's title which is a Hopi word for ""life in transition"".

The third film ""Naqoyqatsi"" is the third film of the ""Qatsi Trilogy"" and this time, Godfrey Reggio and editor Jon Kane took a different approach by using archived and stock footage and manipulating them digitally via non-linear editing workstations with specially produced computer generated imagery to show how society has transitioned from a natural environment to a technological environment.  Reggio called the film ""virtual cinema"" but from the translation of the Hopi title, the meaning is ""life as war"".  The third film would feature another film collaboration with musician Philip Glass who chose to include some non-traditional instruments in the film.

According to Godfrey Reggio, the  film would focus on three core themes:  ""Numerica.com"" which language and place gives way to numerical code and virtual reality; ""Circus Maximus"" which is the Love of money and how life has become a game; and last, ""Rocketship twentieth century"" is technology as war, civilized violence.

Because the film was being created near the World Trade Center at the time, 9/11 and the destruction of the two buildings would have an impact on the film.

VIDEO:

""The Quatsi Trilogy"" is presented in 1080p High Definition with ""Koyaanisqatsi"" and ""Powaqqatsi"" being presented in 1:85:1 while ""Naqoyqatsi"" is presented in 1:78:1.

""Koyaanisqatsi"" is a film that incorporates footage shot by Ron Fricke but also incorporate a few stock shots.  The picture quality  looks great considering this film is around 30-years-old.  Colors are well-saturated and I detected no problematic issues or damage during the viewing of this film.

According to the Criterion Collection, ""Koyaanisqatsi"" was created in 2K resolution on a Northlight Digital Film Scanner from the original 35mm camera negative. A 1999 transfer supervised by Reggio was used as a direct frame-for-frame reference. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS; jitter was fixed using Pixel Farm's PFClean; and Image System's DVNR was used for small dirt, grain, and flicker.

""Powaqqatsi also looks amazing on Blu-ray.  Colors are well-saturated, clarity is very good and also no signs of any problematic issues with picture quality of this film.  The film looks great on Blu-ray!

According to the Criterion Collection, ""Powaqqatsi"" features a new high-definition digital transfer was created on a Spirit Datacine from a new 35mm interpositive struck from the original camera negative. Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices, warps, jitter, and flicker were manually removed using MTI's DRS and Pixel Farm's PFClean, while Image Systems' DVNR was used for small dirt.

And last, ""Naqoyqatsi"" benefits from the fact that it was shot in 2002 but also a film that was manipulated digitally and purposely.  There is footage with wonderful detail but because of the alterations done to the images, various scenes look quite different especially when it comes to color saturation.  I personally detected no artifacts, banding or any problems with picture quality whatsoever, during my viewing of ""Naqoyqatsi"".

According to the Criterion Collection, ""About 30 percent of `Naqoyqatsi's' footage was shot on 35mm negative; this was scanned on a Spirit Datacine at Technicolor New York. The rest of the film - apart from a small quantity of material that was created digitally from scratch - is made up of stock footage that was manipulated using Avid, Adobe After Effects, and, for the 3D material, Maya. The final high-definition footage was color corrected and restored using a Digital Intermediate workflow to create a new negative. ""

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""The Qatsi Trilogy"" is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and the musical score by composer Philip Glass comes alive in lossless HD!  The audio is crystal clear, the music really captivates you and while watching the three films, hearing how certain instruments were isolated through a certain channel.  It was nice to hear but the music for this film is incredible and it enhances your appreciation for each film.

According to the Criterion Collection, ""Koyaanisqatsi"" was remastered at 24-bit from the original Dolby LTRT mags, augmented with some rediscovered mix outtakes that were folded in.  Clicks, thumps and dropouts were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  For ""Powaqqatsi"", the original 4-channel discrete soundtrack was remastered in 5.1 surround at 24-bit from mags made at teh time of the original mix and from the Dolby LTRT.  This 5.1 mix was created in 1999 by composer Philip Glass's music director, Michael Riesman.  Clicks, thumps, and dropouts were manually removed using Pro Tools HD.  And for ""Naqoyqatsi"", the original 5.1 surround soundtrack was remastered at 24-bit from 5.1 discrete digital masters.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Each of the three films featured in ""The Qatsi Trilogy"" are to be experienced.

Some may call it a collage of video clips, some will call it visual poetry or experimental documentary but like art, everyone who watches any of these three films, may it be ""Koyaanisqatsi"", ""Powaqqatsi"" or ""Naqoyqatsi"" will have their own interpretation.

So, you are now wondering if ""The Qatsi Trilogy"" is right for you.  And these is not an easy answer because for one, it's a magnificent set and one of Criterion Collection's most impressive sets when you consider all the special features that were included with it.  But the question you will need to ask yourself, if it is a set that you will enjoy and watch?  Similar to earliest form of film, may it be the Lumiere Brothers or Edison films, while silent and entertaining for its time and are historically amazing as a record of early filmmaking, it's not for everyone.  It's random images of people enjoying their regular life.  For me, I enjoy watching those earlier films because it's exciting to see how technology was able to record an era that was becoming industrialized and modernized.

But ""The Qatsi Trilogy"" are films that show how industrialization, modernization, technology has become so much of a part of our life, we are depended on it.

""Koyaanisqatsi"" is a film that begins with a rocket during liftoff and then visual images of a desert landscape and the beautiful environments of oceans, the clouds, rocks, mountains, deserts.  Serenity for thousands of years until modernization and industrialization  led man to bring their machines to mine, to look for oil, to dig and pave ways for freeways, dams, housing.  And of course, desolate areas that were experimented with bombs.

People building homes, buildings which are then decayed, decrepit and destroyed.  We see modernization and environments as they are but people in time-lapse shots or slow motion.  cars on freeways, a concrete jungle that has now taken over land. For me, the message was clear.  Humanity has taken the land and changed the Earth's environment.  Bare in mind, this film was shot in the mid-70s and released in the '80s.  But the film is such a fascinating film it shows how humans have taken opportunities to use the land that was once free of buildings, freeways, bombs, vehicles but now humanity is having their way with the natural surroundings and environment.

For ""Powaqqatsi"", we see how there are areas in this world that have not been touched by technology or industrialization.  People who  from Serra Pelada in Brazil working to help a man who was hit by a falling rock.  A visual image of a head with multiple exposures.  We watch as the sun is rising in Africa, third world villages where people are enjoying life the way they know it.  We watch as people enjoy life where their ancestors lived untouched by technology.

People living life in villages, enjoying their daily lives, practicing their religion.  But we see how the old traditional ways of life is in a constant battle with industrialization.  Industrialization led to modernization and technology but will these people that have lived their lives from generation to generation now be forced to incorporate technology to their livelihood? As the title mentions...""Life in Transformation"".

The final film ""Naqoyqatsi"" is a frilm  that looks at modern life in industrial countries.  We see people transitioned from natural environments to technology and how appropriate for filmmaker Godfrey Reggio to use computer generated imagery.  It's a bit unnerving compared to the other two films as images are manipulated purposely, but to show that life as we know it has and continues to change.  We are more dependent on technology and it has become part of our lives.

I feel that filmmaker Godfrey Reggio explains it best as a dark film about a world that people can no longer describe.  I found the film to be visually beautiful but yet so jarring as we never seen technology or digital manipulation featured in a Reggio film like it has in ""Naqoyqatsi"".  Part of me wanted the digital manipulation to stop but that is what was important about the film, technology changing the landscape of the world and everything within our lives, some will love it it, some will hate it but it's a film that does make sense to me, having experienced half of my life before computers, Internet, cell phones, smart phones became part of our daily life.

Picture quality of all three films are very good with some video looking amazing in HD while some showing a little shimmer but for the most part, picture quality is good and the balance of visual images with the music is fantastic.

For each of the three films, the music by Philip Glass is amazing and just to hear it via lossless is magnificent.  The music really captivates you and just to hear it with so much clarity on Blu-ray was amazing.  The music just goes hand-in-hand with what you see and it goes to show how unique and in-tune that both filmmaker Godfrey Reggio and composer Philip Glass as well as the editors are in crafting these amazing films.  And with each disc, you get a good number of special features that enhances your appreciation of the film.

So, we go back to the original question of whether ""The Quatsi Trilogy"" is worth it purchasing.  I give an emphatic ""YES!"" but with that being said, it's important to say that these films are not films with dialogue, nor is there an plot nor does it feature acting.  These are films where visual images combined with music produce a story that is interpreted by the viewer.  And while this may not be for everyone, as an overall set, this Criterion Collection release is wonderful.  I'm really impressed by this set and what was included and yes, you are getting your money's worth.

Overall, ""The Qatsi Trilogy"" is amazing visual poetry from filmmaker Godfrey Reggio with fantastic music by Philip Glass.  While each of these three films should be experienced, on Blu-ray the films look and sound fantastic, while the Criterion Collection set itself is magnificent.  Highly recommended!",1355788800,42,18679,5.1568627450980395
5316981,5,B009D004MC,"i've seen all of the versions of Koyaanisqatsi, VHS, LaserDisc, DVD, IRE DVD.  The Criterion transfer is a completely different movie.

I'm not technical when it comes to film, but, for lack of a better description, the Criterion transfer has rock solid frames (no jitter).  In a normal movie this wouldn't be as big of a deal as it is in Koyaanisqatsi.  The time-lapse filming is just transformed into something that is magnificent.  Everything looks awesome and my favorite scenes are just incredible.

The contrast of the film seems to be double.  I am not sure if that is more a product of the transfer or the format, but the cloudscapes and cityscapes are unbelievable.  I could watch The Grid over and over again.

This is the best Blu-Ray disc.  Period.  If I could give it 10 I would.

Thank you Criterion!",1355356800,90,814,4.654929577464789
5316982,5,B009D004MC,"I have trouble understanding Godfrey Reggio who, along with Ron Fricke and Philip Glass, created this stunning collection of films. Reggio's words are very ""in the ether"" to me. But that's MY limitations not his. He doesn't want to ""talk down to"" me to make his processes more understandable.
Luckily, it is not necessary- his finished products do not need to be understood so much as experienced.
In an interview in one of the supplements he makes a distinction between a symbol and a sacrament- the symbol represents something while a sacrament creates the thing it represents (a wedding ring symbolizes a union while the sacrament of Marriage creates that union)... I believe then that this trilogy may be a sacrament.
The films, most especially the first Koyaanisqatsi, are literally AWESOME.
And the Blu Ray transfers and the Supplements to the discs are wonderful.",1355356800,5,870,5.048611111111111
5316983,4,B009D004MC,"I can't think of many films that might make you angry and sad all at the same time. All the best ones I suppose. This trilogy is beyond amazing, though, the third film is mostly throw away at this point. You should in fact look for the best price possible because I don't think paying for the two main films mastered in only 2K, along with compression issues despite the high bitrate, is worth more than 35 dollars.

The colors are no longer muddy and off but distinct and powerfully vibrant at least. Pretty neat extras all around and the score by Philip Glass is worth noting as well in uncompressed sound.  I have to knock a couple stars off here as this release from Criterion has sloppy compression issues you can view at capsaholic. It's pretty bad in places, mostly for people with larger screens, and mars an otherwise nice collection. I cannot totally recommend this without a new 4K scan either.

If you get it on a nice sale then go for it. I doubt we will see another release until 4K. The UK Arrow release of the two main films looks stunning, and has MUCH better compression and grain structure than this release. It is region B and I recommend that over this one if you have a player that can play region B discs.

Criterion needs to step their game up. Thief and On The Waterfront of late, among others, are absolutely terrible with major compression issues or plain low bitrates. For a lot of people you will probably never notice these things, but let's be honest here these films are not cheap from Criterion. I expect the best. I'd say this one definitely has some issues altogether that are not totally forgivable. It looks good but could look better.

For 30 bucks I'd bite just for the sake that region A discs are much easier to play. But I have yet to see that price for this set. It's not really worth much more tbh.",1354665600,6,1842,4.405882352941177
5316984,5,B009D004MC,"It is impossible to rate the quality of the product before viewing it, but, millions of us have awaited a home version of Koyaaniisqatsi in high definition for decades.  This film stands among the three as one of the five best films ever made.  Incredibly prophetic, dazzlingly brilliant cinematography that began a time lapse revolution, and Philip Glass's haunting music which never seems to go out of style, let's hope the vision of Reggio is perfectly realized in this digital transfer.  If you have never seen this film, it may be worth the 80 bucks for the first in the trilogy alone.  It stands head and shoulders above the vast majority of cinematic art.

Update 2017, purchased and viewed the movies. Video and audio transfer superb. This is the reference standard, I can't add any more to the other reviewers.  30+ years after its creation Koyannisqatsi finds its way into home theaters capable of realizing its stunning impact. Buy it, you will watch it again and again over the next 50 years, if civilization lasts that long.",1353110400,11,1037,4.830508474576271
5316985,5,B009D004MC,"This is obviously not a review of the Blu-ray set, but a comment on the release of this amazing trilogy.  I have been waiting since the dawn of time (okay, the dawn of blu-rays) for this to be released in this format.  And to find out that Criterion will be putting them out leaves me in a state of sheer joy!

Three of my favorite films of all time, ""The Qatsi Trilogy"" is a work of art that virtually nothing else can compare to.  A series of gorgeous films, not documentaries (though some have called them this) but moving, living art, that depicts man and Earth's relationship, man and society's relationship, and man and machine's relationship.

""Koyaanisqatsi - Life Out of Balance"" delves into the beauty of the planet, and man's intrusion upon it.  As in all three films, time lapse photography, stunning aerial footage, and some of the most brilliant cinematography you will ever witness (by Ron Fricke, director of Baraka, which is a distillation of this trilogy in my eyes), will keep you in awe and wonder, from first frame to last.

Add to that, three lush soundtracks by Phillip Glass (with an amazing performance by Yo-Yo Ma on ""Naqoyqatsi"") and Godfrey Reggio's stunning vision, captured and created over two decades, and you have a stellar work of art, that is truly incomparable.  There is no dialogue in ANY of these films, but an epic tale is told nonetheless.

""Powaqatsi - Life in Transformation"" reaches back to ancient civilization and on into the present, questioning everything we refer to as ""progress.""  What is the price we pay for ""advancement,"" and how do we (and the planet) lose out by the steps we take to move forward?

""Naqoyqatsi - Life as War"" brings us into the computer age, where technology, war, and the threat of war, is infused into every aspect of our lives.  It makes a point of revealing how we have learned, and accepted, to rely on machinery to run our lives and often run amok.  While I haven't had three decades to delve into this film, as I have ""Koyaaniqatsi,"" I am sure that there is so much more for me to learn, and decipher, from this amazing piece of work.  Though still managing to be stunningly beautiful, I have found this the hardest of the trilogy to watch, the sense of doom and devastation being palpable throughout.

I hope this helps those wondering what ""The Qatsi trilogy"" is, and I cannot recommend any films more than I can these.  I am a photographer, and I KNOW that these films have guided me, and helped create my artistic vision more than anything else in my life.

I believe that anyone that loves film, anyone that feels the loss humanity has experienced as we move further away from a society based upon nature and ""being at one"" with the planet, and anyone that does not need dialogue to have a story told to you, will adore these films as much as I have.  Do not hesitate to make this trilogy a part of your collection, you cannot go wrong when a masterpiece is being offered to you.",1352073600,74,2964,4.560377358490566

Amazon's ad for the Qatsi Trilogy (Criterion) specifies ""Multi-Format, "" which is great news for anyone wanting to watch these films in advance of acquiring a Blu-ray player.  ""It's A Mad ... Mad World"" (also Criterion) is offered in an actual multi-format set.  However, my Qatsi set, which arrived this weekend, is NOT multi-format, nor is there so much as a hint on the box that such a thing as a standard DVD is included or accessible - my DVD player won't load the disc.  Therefore, Amazon's ad is inaccurate and misleading, period.  I took two stars off for that.

That being said, since I've been purchasing a number of Blu-ray titles in advance of having an actual Blu-ray player, I'm very much looking to viewing this set.  I'm awe-struck by these films(!), particularly Koyannisqatsi, which I'm anxious to hear in true 5.1 surround instead of the usual 2-channel mix-down that's accompanied it in past editions, including the IRE's private, director-approved 4x3 edition.  That alone may be the tipping point that pushes me into acquiring that new BR player.

Apparently, during the Pruit-Igoe scenes, they did not use the best of cameras (it was filmed in 1975 on a small budget, so they didn't use the best camera film for the shots)  However, for the majority of the film, they do, apparently, use decent enough film to transfer into Blu-ray.  Criterion should be applauded for taking a chance at giving this movie a much needed overhaul.  This is the only chance you have at watching a decent version of this movie.

5317039,5,B009D004MC,"To say the least, this review isn't about the Criterion Collection, although I followed many of their releases years ago, and they've produced some amazing releases. I don't write reviews often, so the reason I'm reviewing this is because, it's a movie that not only addresses but actually does something with an under-served vision of the medium of film. There aren't many movies that are wordless and plotless (the 2nd is debatable), but this movie uses all the high quality production resources of a Hollywood movie and manages to accomplish what a blockbuster does: it captures footage of the world like we've not exactly seen it and reflects it like an art. It says more than a movie with dialogue. The images speak for themselves, but if that's not enough, there's a score by Philip Glass in the first two (the director's commentary mentions that their sounds and images are a lot more linked/synced than a simple accompaniment). I'm only reviewing the first two because while I've seen the 3rd one, it's perhaps most difficult to like instantly, because I've not wanted to see it again immediately like the other two(the first two and their bonus features are worth the price of 3- if you want to look at it that way). Another way I see the 3rd film, is that it's intentionally unpleasant. The best way to convey something bad is to make it like Requiem for a Dream or Trainspotting. Portraying an opinion on a subject by suggesting it's undesirable. The fact that I instantly liked the first two suggests that if they're not widely accessible, I am not either (and why I find most mainstream movies inaccessible).

This trilogy leaves me with a lot of ideas to want to talk about- it's an experience and not just an idea of course, but it's the realization that one can't exactly live that ""other"" world that is being eroded as portrayed in Koyaanisqaatsi and Powaqqatsi. I can feel empathy when I see these movies but I tend to get distracted by technology to have an interest in cultural life for a very long time. This trilogy is made by people who not only are aware of life before the 1980s, but are able to portray it as if we were there too. This movie makes me want to understand life before the immortal magician of technology has gotten our attention on a regular, or at least semi-regular basis. Not many movies have done this. At the same time, I'm not someone who watches as many movies as I used to, thus the reason I'm writing this is because it's a breath of fresh air that I've discovered a work of art that uses the medium in an alternative way. I'm unsure how often movies like this get made- surely there is lots of other content that has a different view- this one is grand in many ways. It's my hesitance to want to expose myself to much more after finding something with so much replay value. It provokes, it makes me think. The movies are a meditation on life. At worst, it's better than a screensaver to watch on my computer. At best, it's the reminder of what's missing- it's a guide or a gateway to the world that never was. I wouldn't be surprised if movies like this became more popular, because the format of many trailers today- short clips to entertain us without doing much more, don't go deep like these movies do. They suggest that another way of life is possible, despite all pessimism and naysaying. It only requires a patience- the drumbeat of a movie without dialogue or ""plot"" will appear absent, but it's there- it's just natural- your own heartbeat. This movie is similar to the art project of Cristian Marclay and his 24hr clock film exhibit. It is a timescape, as is Chronos- but is more focused on themes other than time, without mentioning them- and they're well known, but the great difference is that this movie allows us to feel those themes. Powaqqatsi captures a great glimpse of the developing world, which, if it is to believed, is following the shadow of the industrialized world, yet some are ignorant of it, and are either blissful or foolish or both. It appears the first film is in 35mm while the 2nd is in 70mm, but they are both high quality- better than DVD. I'd agree with another reviewer that Koyaanisqaatsi captures a larger vision- it is about the North (Western culture too that seems), but it does it in a way that is able to reveal a lot about the old way of life, not having to show the ""3rd world"" but merely by showing us in another light. We look like eusocial ants at times- bustling through train stations and intersections in metropolises and in that way it exposes our primitive ways in a comfortable and sometimes humorous portrayal. The soundtracks are no less than spectacular- I've heard other stuff by Philip Glass, including Satyagraha, so it's a pleasant addition to my impression and perhaps a very selective on at that based on how reluctant I am to seek out other great films when there's a lot more to analyze and think about with these. To emphasize, but not summarize a timescape movie or technique as used in this trilogy offers the viewer a greater vantage about their position in life, and gave me many ideas about the meaning of life. That it's a wide and diverse thing(s), and that it's often changing, and that some things appear very vital yet are fading. It makes me want to not watch another formulaic trailer again, or simply access this way of life enough to feel like I'm not missing out on something human.",1370044800,,5417,4.5845360824742265
5317040,4,B009D004MC,"I usually don't like reviewing a cluster of movies in one big lump (heck, I don't even like doing an entire TV season) but these movies are so thematically and technically similar I feel like I can get away with it.

All three, Koyaanisqatsi, Powaqqatsi, and Naqoyqatsi, are wordless films with footage set to music. Koyaanisqatsi uses images of nature contrasted with industry in North America. Powaqqatsi shows third-world countries and how people live relative to the land, rather than exploiting it. Naqoyqatsi uses mostly altered footage to show how dependent our lifestyle has become on technology and the digitization of our society.

Of the three, Koyaanisqatsi is by far the best - it has the most impact and has the grandest message to say. The footage in this film is also probably the most stunning of the three, which is saying a lot compared to the also-gorgeous Powaqqatsi. Powaqqatsi is very good as well, as it shows us ways of life we have likely not considered, though it does not pack the meaningful punch that its predecessor does. Naqoyqatsi is just not very good, as in 2002, we already know technology is everywhere; its message is not very original, and making us sit through 90 minutes to remind us that doesn't make much of a difference.

While I enjoyed the first two, all three are honestly difficult to sit through; Philip Glass's scores are engaging and most of the footage is interesting to look at, but it is hard to watch an hour and a half of plotless, wordless film, let alone over the course of three films. I'm glad I've seen them, but I don't think I would ever watch them again.

Director Godfrey Reggio did a very interesting and ambitious experiment with the Qatsi Trilogy, but he unfortunately could not maintain the quality and urgency of his message throughout the twenty-year saga.

5317052,5,B009D004MC,"Koyaanisqatsi is my favorite film, so I had impossibly high expectations for this Criterion set. The transfer mostly meets and exceeds those expectations, particularly when it comes to audio quality and bonus features, although my experience was marred by uneven video quality on Koyaanisqatsi. Quick notes:

KOYAANISQATSI: ""The Grid,"" which had me drooling, is worth the price of the entire set--it is just that good. And I noticed details within ""Pruitt-Igoe"" that I'd never seen before, such as glass shattering from windows as one of the buildings implodes. (Very impressive.) Other clips are greatly enhanced by this transfer: the focus on the ladies outside of the Vegas casino, the slow-motion airplane approach and the closing rocket footage all come to mind.

However, much of the footage contains heavy grain, especially in the first (nature) half. Visible swirls of colorful dots/grain abound in the skies and surf--frankly, ""Organic"" and ""Cloudscape"" sections didn't always seem like an improvement over the DVD. I'm sure this is due to the way the original footage was shot, and not a consequence of the transfer, but either way you won't get the flawless picture that you get from, say, Baraka. It's a letdown because I was hoping to be blown away by the cloud/water sequence.

In bonus features, pay special attention to the early cuts scored by Allen Ginsberg. They feature lots of additional footage--clips that would have made a wonderful contribution to the final film (though Ginsberg's soundtrack leaves a lot to be desired).

POWAQQATSI: The best of the trilogy in terms of video transfer. My opinion, and appreciation, of the film skyrocketed upon viewing in blu-ray format. I'll watch it again before re-watching the others. Really, this had my jaw on the floor; and I enjoyed the accompanying interview with Godfrey Reggio.

NAQOYQATSI: I am not a reliable source. Reggio monkeyed with the footage/images to such a profound extent that it's difficult to judge the transfer. And I'm not a fan of the film in the first place; it feels episodic and not thematically cohesive.

Overall, I highly recommend the blu-ray, if only to heighten your experience ""The Grid"" and the entirety of Powaqqatsi. And if you've never seen these films, BUY THEM in any format--they can change you!",1358467200,3,2301,5.1226666666666665
5317053,5,B009D004MC,"My three favorite movies get the Criterion Collection Blu-Ray treatment!  Philip Glass is my man and he is a compositional BEAST!  All three soundtracks are masterpieces in their own way- they complement each other, yet stand alone as well.  The only way this set could be improved would be adding the new orchestral version of Koyaanisqatsi that is now being performed here and there around the world, for example, the LA Philharmonic's and Philip Glass Ensemble performance at the Hollywood Bowl a couple years ago.  And, PG should have been named on the cover.  Otherwise, this is everything I've been waiting for- I don't have to reiterate how wonderful these movies are- many of the images are seared into my brain!

I have just received the Qatsi trilogy, and I have just watched the Koyaanisqatsi film and I am quite disappointed.

And yes I'm an absolute fan of this movie, it's a masterpiece, but the transfer to blu ray is dismal.

The image is grainy and jittery, some artifacts still remain in the image which is a huge let down.

To be frank, I was expecting the same transfer quality to blu ray as Baraka, but quite honestly you won't find it here.

I have watched it on two different tvs to make sure that it was not my equipment that was at fault

Eye candy fans, look elsewhere.",1357171200,24,762,4.330985915492958
5317056,3,B009D004MC,"""Koyaanisqatsi"" (1983) (Blu-ray)

After waiting patiently for years to see this brilliantly unique film in Blu-ray, Criterion has seen fit to release it in a rather pricey package with the two notably inferior sequels, ""Powaqqatsi"" and ""Naqoyqatsi,"" both lacking the superb cinematography and editing of Ron Fricke so evident in the first film.

The added definition of Blu-ray makes it more obvious that first film in the series, outstanding as is, was edited from sources using different equipment and over a considerable time period.  My understanding from the commentary of producer Godfrey Reggio is that the sources for ""Koyaanisqatsi"" were created and collected over a period of six years.

""Koyaanisqatsi"" was edited and re-edited  several times to finally produce a film of stunning imagery and power and different viewers will come away with completely different impressions of what the film is telling them -- one being that our technology is not something that we have created to coexist with us but rather a kind of host within which we exist.  Sadly, the two sequels cannot convey this power and the third, in particular, produces the effect of being a collection of unrelated visual impressions lacking a sense of thematic cohesiveness.

The music scores of the three films were created by composer Philip Glass, the score for the first film being the most effective.  In this instance there was a great deal of interaction between composer  Glass and cinematographer Fricke under the guidance of producer Godfrey Reggio that yielded such excellent results.  The recorded sound quality of the score (there is no narration or dialogue in any of these films) was greatly improved in the Blu-ray issue compared to the DVD issue of 2002.",1356825600,17,1748,5.144876325088339

After all, how can three films that ask you to think about what you're seeing, possibly compete with one outrageous, violent, childish and frequently bizarre video war game after another, to which millions of boys (and larger boys who mistakenly refer to themselves ""men"")?  The ""tech revolution"" will  undoubtedly claim victory over us unless an increasing number of now rare grown up citizens are able to elevate themselves  to a level in which films such as these of Mr. Reggio, cause us to think about what has happened to our  rapidly degenerating country and now world, now stupidly pursuing the path we've so happily laid out for it (in exchange for a few bucks) and decide to diligently take action to reverse the effects of these past 35 years.  This is a TASK, to be sure, one for which we shall require all the diligence we can muster and the good fortune we must pray for. Thank you Mr. Reggio and good luck.
