7034828,5,B00UB76QKA,"A Ring By Spring is about a woman named Caryn Briggs (Rachel Boston) who is single at 30 year old. For years Caryn was not interested in getting married until she went to a fortuneteller, Madame Rue (Stefanie Powers) with her friends. Madame Rue tells Caryn that she will get a ring by spring or she will never marry. Caryn's boyfriend, Bryce (Christopher Jacot) breaks up with her because he thinks she is not marriage material. Caryn meets with all her serious boyfriends and ask them why they broke up her.  Caryn starts a new job and meets her new boss, Tom  Halsey (Kirby Morrow). Tom and Caryn have a lot in common. Everyone at the office knows Tom has a crush on Caryn.  Tom finally gets the courage to ask Caryn out on a date but Caryn tells Tom she got back together with Bryce and is engaged to him in order to have a ring by spring.  Watch this movie to see if Caryn marries Bryce or does she marry Tom. I love this movie I hope you do too.",1427587200,18,951,4.208791208791209

7034832,5,B00UB76QKA,"A well-cast romance with an excellent characterizations and an unanticipated conclusion. I thoroughly enjoyed it, making it ""a keeper"".
Note that the ""DVD"" is actually a DVD-R (printed on the disc itself and on the package, where the ""DVD-R"" designation is microscopic: it's one of the titles where demand was not expected to be large, so is produced ""on demand"".

7034875,2,B00UB76QKA,"A certain type of person watches Hallmark movies and is happy with them. I admit right now, I am not that kind of person. But this movie I thought was odd even for a Hallmark movie. Rachel Boston is a perfect lead for a romantic movie. She appears, pretty, approachable, and bright. I bought her as someone who was a business consultant and also someone ambivalent about marriage. She really doesn't need anything that traditional marriage can bring to the table.  But after seeing a fortune teller who tells her she will never marry if she doesn't get a ring by spring... I can see anyone freaking a bit. While all this is going on she is working with a great guy at her job Tom Halsey the CEO of the company she is analyzing. Throughout the entire movie she likes Tom but isn't really attracted it seems. As usual for a Hallmark movie there doesn't seem to be anything really awesome about Tom. He is nice but not exactly a looker and seems completely lost as to how to get a woman interested in him. He is just kind of ""there"" and not too objectionable.  Tom of course likes Caryn, but never seriously makes more than a half hearted move (probably because she has a boyfriend). After all the strife over the fortune she comes to believe she is not destined to marry and breaks it off with her boyfriend who she doesn't really like that much anyway. She is happy and content. Movie over right? Nope. She runs into the fortune teller who tells her that wasn't the lesson she was supposed to learn and then, Caryn comes to conclude Tom is the love of her life. Movie over. Err ok. I couldn't help feeling annoyed. She is out of Tom's league and it appears like she is just settling due to some fortune teller telling her to get married.",1442102400,3,1736,4.388198757763975

7034908,4,B00UB76QKA,"A RING BY SPRING is a romantic comedy that aired on the Hallmark Channel in 2014, and I give it 3.5 out of 5 stars. It's fluff but fun. It stars Rachel Boston as Caryn Briggs, a 30-year-old business consultant whose career trumps her love life. Caryn is something of a cynic and someone who is committment-phobic. She confesses to having been the only 12-year-old girl to not swoon over Romeo & Juliet. 12-year-old Caryn was aghast that Juliet would throw her life away just for love. Grown-up years later, the wake-up call comes when, one evening, at a charity fundraiser, on a whim, Caryn and her pals Gregg (Chad Krowchuk) and Stephanie (Ali Liebert) saunter over to get a reading (at $10 a pop) from one of the event's featured attractions, that gypsy fortuneteller Madame Roue (Stefanie Powers).

Caryn is all scoffy at what Madame Roue's got in store for her: ""You will receive a ring by spring... or you will never marry."" But, then, the soothsayer's predictions about her friends start coming true. And there's Caryn freaking out a bit. She's channeling John Cusack from HIGH FIDELITY as she embarks on a stint of soul-searching. Doesn't help that her boyfriend's just dumped her over dinner. He claims she's not marriage material. He's maybe not wrong.

Into Caryn's dark cloud comes the silver lining in the shape of new client Tom Halsey (Kirby Morrow), good-natured CEO of an online surplus business. He's hired her to figure out why his once thriving enterprise is now at a standstill. Now, this is the Hallmark Channel, guys, so I think you can play merry matchmaker from here on out.

A RING BY SPRING continuously shifts between bubbly and angsty, and it's good that Rachel Boston looks striking and comes across as accessible. It's a predictable plotline. Hallmark's not the sort to toss you a curve. It relies on your craving for what's comfy and safe and familiar, and those aren't bad things to crave occasionally. The only suspense centers on if (when) Caryn gets that marriage proposal. It's an affable enough cast. Stefanie Powers is the biggest name on the credits, and she makes the most of her two scenes. A RING BY SPRING won't surprise you, but it may entertain you. And maybe, for that young someone out there, this'll be the first movie they'll see that showcases that age-old bromide about putting yourself out there to take a chance on love. That someone won't know that this movie's beating a dead, old horse.",1431907200,3,2442,4.768321513002364

7034917,5,B00UB76QKA,"A young and busy woman, Caryn Briggs (Rachel Boston), has too much going on in her own life to get concentrating about not being married when she is only thirty. In fact, the whole idea rather cramped her style a bit feeling that she would be tied down afterward anyway. She would have to bend to a husband's ideas on things, maybe make too many compromises that she is unwilling to do. That certainly explains why she has had more than her fair share of boyfriends that she did not get overly involved with to avoid it in the first place. One could easily say that Caryn is happy with hanging out with her friends and working as a business consultant. This is how she views her life until a certain point when she goes along with her friends, Stephanie (Ali Liebert) and Gregg (Chad Krowchuk) to a fundraising event and something changes her thinking - radically. They decide it might be fun to have their fortunes read by the mysterious Madame Rue (Stephanie Powers). So how much thought does one really put into that, right?

Madame Rue tells Caryn that if she does not have a ring by spring, she will never marry. Well, this had never bothered her before but it soon becomes an issue as she eventually sees her friends fortunes coming true. Maybe she ought to be giving this more thought, but she already has a boyfriend, Bryce (Chris Jacot). He is a little stuffy but will he be presenting a ring?  Of course, right?  Meanwhile, she takes a new job with a different boss, Tom Halsey (Kirby Morrow) who is interesting although her mind keeps wondering to 'the ring by spring' issue to give other things much thought. It does get interesting how something that didn't carry any weight previously suddenly rises to a point of such importance in a woman's thinking. Bryce throws Caryn a curveball and breaks it off with her. This leaves her thinking that what was inevitable is now impossible. Is it time for Caryn to start thinking about the life that she always used to want or why her mind has changed and how Madame Rue fits into any of this after all.

Another easy Hallmark movie that caught my eye with a marriage theme. These films are always so easy to view without all the complicated storylines for those times when you like your movies more predictable. I love to put in a Hallmark movie (especially a relationship story) while I am alone as it gets to the 'hopeless romantic' in me.",1429747200,20,2396,4.5265588914549655
