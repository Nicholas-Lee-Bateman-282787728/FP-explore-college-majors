8116724,4,B000F3AAGG,This is a very fun and clean movie.  The interaction between the main characters is great.  I also enjoyed the Mexican songs with the beautiful voice of Pedro Infante.,1384214400,,167,4.724137931034483
8116725,4,B000F3AAGG,"I like it.  Could do without the previews though, I didn't like those.  The movie has been Obviously edited to fit your television and it was done poorly but I guess it is the best they could do from an actual film edit.",1365638400,,220,4.093023255813954
8116726,5,B000F3AAGG,"The plot in this silly but highly entertaining romantic comedy begins with Carolina, who goes to the Instituto de Cien Primaveras because she wants to be a ""perfect wife."" Carolina has three men pursuing her, but is not totally in love with any of them. She writes a letter to ""the man of her dreams,"" and not only does it accidentally get mailed, but the name she addressed it to actually exists, and it is Pablo! In order to avoid him when he shows up, she pretends to be her own brother by dressing as a navy cadet. There are many amusing scenes as Pablo is at first confused, and then suspects the truth of her disguise, and of course, there are five wonderful songs as well, by Manuel Esperon and Cuco Sanchez, sung beautifully as only Pedro Infante can.

The cast glitters and shines, particularly Pedro Infante as Pablo, Irasema Dilian as Carolina, Alejandro Ciangherotti as Enrique, Pablo's snoozing brother, and the ever funny Eduardo Alcaraz, as Guillermo the butler. Director Mauricio de la Serna also co-wrote the script, and the film is in color, and in good condition despite its age, though sometimes is a little heavy in the green and orange shades. Infante fans will love this film, which was one of his last, even though it is not the type of Comedia Ranchera we usually associate with him, and has a more ""Hollywood/Doris Day"" feel to it. ""Pablo y Carolina"" has a sweet innocence, and would make a perfect ""date movie."" No subtitles available.",1177372800,2,1462,4.666666666666667
