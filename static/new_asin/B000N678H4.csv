8175093,5,B000N678H4,"I was fortunate to be acquainted with Hans Petersen during his time in Salt Lake City. I was also fortunate to be in the audience for the initial ""run through"" of the one man play. I knew a little of the character Thomas Paine from my history classes in school. Listening to Hans do his one man play brought life to what I had learned in school. Everyone in the audience was completely captivated by his words and movements. One of the best spent hours in my memory.
