368640,5,6301801725,"This movie is truly a classic.  Very touching and funny is George C. Scott as Mordecai ""the flim flam man"".  This could be classified as a road picture as Scott and Michael Sarrison an army deserter during the Vietnam War, go from town to town pulling scams on hicks who are also trying to get something for nothing.  Henry Morgan is very funny as the sheriff chasing them.  Where is the DVD for this movie.  Sue Lyon who was a hottie in the 1960's plays the love interest of Sarrison, and daughter of Henry Morgan. Morgan starts out chasing a moonshiner named Dootle whom he thinks made his last escape by using an ""anphobibias"" vehicle.  To not like this movie means you are humorless, there is a great car chase even by todays standards.",1078876800,8,740,4.485074626865671
368641,5,6301801725,"Not too many people have heard of the 1967 film ""The Flim Flam Man,"" and that's too bad for them. I have owned this lovely valentine of a movie for several years, and have always appreciated its comedic/dramatic allure. Everything clicks perfectly in this old fashioned film, from its authentic locations (this movie was filmed in small town Kentucky) to a wonderful musical score by Jerry Goldsmith.
I love George C. Scott's rip-snorting performance as a train-hopping con-man whose legend precedes him. He literally stumbles upon a military AWOL drifter in Michael Sarrazin, and the unlikely pair join forces to make a little cash. Camping in abandoned railroad cars, hiking cross country and stealing a car or two, this colorful pair eventually has the county police hot on their tails. Along the way, Sarrazin falls in love with the mayor's daughter, Slim Pickens loses his paycheck (great scene) and Scott samples a bit of the local moonshine.
""The Flim Flam Man"" is aided by a cast of extraordinary character actors, including Harry Morgan, Jack Albertson, Strother Martin, Albert Salmi and Pickens. Morgan, as the local sheriff, is especially funny in a grand slapstick role. But director Irvin Kershner has done an excellent job in balancing comedy, drama and romance with skilled ease. It's the quieter moments in ""The Flim Flam Man"" that I truly admire, such as the scene when Scott reminisces about the purple-eyed girl he once loved in Missouri, or when Sarrazin discusses his dreams of the future with Sue Lyon.
This is such a charming movie, that each time I watch it I'm sad to see it end. ""The Film Flam Man"" transports us to a dreamy Southern land, colorful and optimistic, train whistles in the background, vibrant town squares, campfires beneath railroad bridges, bustling general stores. While this film was made in 1967, the small town ambiance of ""The Flim Flam Man"" harkens back to a time 30-40 years prior. It's a romantic recreation, in some ways a tender tribute to a past way of life. I always find the final image, of the abandoned bicycle resting at the railroad crossing, to be haunting, with Scott's character having disappeared to rustic parts unknown. I would love to join him on his journey.
For those anacquainted, ""The Flim Flam Man"" is a great discovery.",1063411200,95,2291,4.922480620155039
368642,4,6301801725,"As loveable rogue Mordecai Jones, George C. Scott endures bad community theatre make-up and inhales acres of gorgeous Southern scenery in this picaresque crowd-pleaser about a veteran con-man and his reluctant apprentice (Michael Sarrazin). Three years shy of the career-defining ""Patton,"" Scott clearly relished the chance to let his hair down amid ""Flim-Flam Man's"" feel-good flood of chicanery, slapstick and car chases (this one has a couple of beauts). Sarrazin, a good actor who unfortunately never found his big break-out role, is fine as Curley, an Army deserter whose talent for larceny is undermined by a stubborn streak of honesty. Flaxen-haired beauty Sue Lyon, who epitomized, in the Sixties, the image of the girl you wished lived next door, is wholesomely alluring as Sarazzin's love interest. Rounding out the cast is a dizzying assemblage of fun character actors - Harry Morgan, Strother Martin, Alice Ghostley, Slim Pickens, Jack Albertson, Albert Salmi - whose presence makes for a lively game of ""Name That Second Banana.""
An unassuming curio from the same year (1967) as the iconoclastic ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" ""The Flim-Flam Man"" is good-looking, well-acted, imaginatively directed (by Irvin Kershner, who later skippered ""The Empire Strikes Back""), and wildly successful at its sole purpose: to entertain. Hollywood used to excel at this brand of lightsome fare. Today, hopelessly vulgarized and dumbed-down, and hell-bent on dragging the audience down to its level, Tinseltown wouldn't know where to begin to make a flick like this. That's everybody's loss.",1055980800,20,1578,5.444897959183673
368643,5,6301801725,"Most of us probably think of George C. Scott and think ""Patton.""  In this movie he plays a character about as far removed from General George as you can get.  Mordecai Jones is a con artist with a mission: to teach people (by ""flim-flamming"" them) not to give in to ""greed and fourteen-karat ignorance.""  Jason ""Curly"" Treadaway, a farmboy who has deserted the Army after breaking the jaw of a mouthy Yankee sergeant, comes to his aid when he's thrown off a train.  Since both are broke, Mordecai suggests that Curly shill for him long enough to accumulate a small stake.  From this springs a partnership in which Curly, to his dismay, discovers he has a real gift for dishonest dealings.  Tormented by conscience and shattered illusions, he still originates a plan to escape when the pair are finally run down and arrested--and then comes up with an even more audacious one to get Jones out, because, as he tells the girl he's fallen in love with, ""he's my *partner*, and that means somethin'.""
This movie lacks the slapstick that often characterizes comedy; there's a wild car chase (Jones and Curly in a convertible Mordecai has ""borrowed,"" pursued by the local sheriff, turning their chariot into a ""ramblin' wreck"" and destroying a considerable portion of the town of Clayton in the process), but most of the film concentrates on Mordecai's schemes--everything from three-card monte and punchboards through the Pigeon Drop to an elaborate masquerade in which he manages to swap a truckload of moonshine for a mound of assorted merchandise.  The supporting cast is especially good, with Harry Morgan shining as Sheriff Slade and Albert Salmi delightful as his young chief deputy, Meshaw.  And while not for the morally ambivalent, it manages to bring up some important ethical issues.  As Mordecai tells Curly, ""You can't cheat a honest man!""  With no sex or profanity to speak of, it could well serve as the launching point for some telling discussions with your kids about right and wrong, loyalty, and what honesty really is.",1044230400,5,2032,4.915204678362573
368644,5,6301801725,"I liked this movie...The movie does differ from the book in a number of ways, but not with the basic philosophy. ..One:  the movie was not set in rural Texas, but in North Carolina--although it was filmed in Kentucky as the producers thought the landscape there looked more like North Carolina than the real thing (go figure); second, there are blacks in the movie, in the general store at Ellers Bend, and there are black characters in the book, but none of them were being flim-flammed.  I'd like the video even better if we received any royalties from it!  I thought Scott was fine as Mordecai; Sarazin good as Curley (in spite of being a Canadian having to speak with a Southern accent); Harry Morgan was great as Sheriff Meshaw; Alice Ghostley and Jack Albertson fine as Mr. and Mrs. Packard; Sue Lyon adequate as the love interest.  Minor characters (the Flim-Flamees), especially Slim Pickens, were excellent.  I particularly liked the way the movie used the train motif--from the beginning, with Scott being thrown from a train, to the middle with the whistle in the background in the Slim Pickens scene, and wrapping the whole thing up at the end with the Flim-Flam Man's bicycle left behind at the railroad siding.  This movie holds up well, even though it was filmed in 1967.",1041379200,13,1286,4.744394618834081
368645,4,6301801725,"The sad truth is you will be very, very lucky to find this movie on TV, and unless you know a store that has a copy on VHS you are destined to miss one of George C. Scott's finest performances. Most people know Scott for his portrayal of Patton. His portrayal of Mordecai Jones although less honorable is far more funny. To my knowledge Scott did not play but perhaps in two other comedies, Dr. Strangelove which he did a memorable job, and ""They Might Be Giants"", which was more cerebral. This is the funniest and lightest. Great fun for the whole family. Good support from Michael Sarrazin, Sue Lyon, Harry Morgan, Slim Pickens, and the rest the cast. Some Keystone Cop type chases are funny along with the preachings of Morticai about the dishonesty of man to his new protege Curley. This is a beautiful film with some wonderful scenes of what a small rural town was like in the early to mid 1960s. Hopefully this will come out on DVD since in my humble opinion it is one of Scott's greatest performances. It frustrates me that so many comedies that are out on DVD lack humor and believe it funny to trash people, and this exceptional comedy is not available yet. Update September 30, 2015: Check around for a Region 1 DVD of this movie, I picked one up today for $14.95 with free shipping, This $119.90 is a ridiculous price.",1035936000,34,1329,4.473251028806584
368646,5,6301801725,"Years ago a friend kept bugging me to buy a VCR; I was ""depriving my family without one."" I told him I'd buy a VCR when ""The Flim Flam Man"" was available on video. A few months later he said he'd seen it in a catalog; I bought our first VCR that weekend. This movie is ""simple"" in its exploitation of numerous stereotypes of southeastern people and culture, but it is thoroughly entertaining, offering chase scenes, a ""young love"" conundrum, and a forthright presentation of ethical dilemmas. Suitable for everyone, this movie was one of my ""training films"" in the raising of my son. It's one of few movies I've watched more than once, and I've watched it over a dozen times. See it if you can.",998870400,3,694,4.47244094488189
368647,5,6301801725,"Prior to the legendary performance by George C. Scott in PATTON, my only exposure to this great actor had been THE FLIM-FLAM MAN, released in 1967. I actually saw it at a drive-in movie, which, for those too young to remember, was essentially a parking lot with a huge screen at one end. Patrons paid at an entrance kiosk, drove in, parked next to a speaker mounted at each parking space, and watched the show (unless, as might happen with young couples, hormone levels dictated inattention to the plot).
Scott plays Mordecai Jones, Master of Back-Stabbin', Cork-Screwin' and Dirty Double-Dealin'. While unfortunately regarded as a con artist by the general populace, he maintains that he profits only from the greed of others, and that an honest man can't be taken advantage of. In this comedy, his wanderings have brought him to the South, where he hooks up with Curley, a young Army deserter played by Michael Sarrazin. Along the way, the world savvy Mordecai teaches Curley lessons about life, while together they successfully fleece some of the region's less upright citizens. A basically decent kid, Curley suffers pangs of conscience over their scams, but remains sufficiently undebilitated to fall in love with a cutie played by Sue Lyon, daughter of a local Prominent Citizen.
The film has a marvelous cast of character actors familiar to Baby Boomers: Jack Albertson, Strother Martin, Albert Salmi, Slim Pickens, and Harry Morgan. Morgan (otherwise remembered as Joe Friday's partner on TV's DRAGNET, and as Colonel Potter on TV's MASH), is particularly good as the local-yokel sheriff out to nab our two heroes.
THE FLIM-FLAM MAN is a gentle, humorous fairy tale played out on a stage that could never exist. For instance, nary a single black is encountered as the story unfolds. And this is below the Mason-Dixon Line? However, that shouldn't detract from the affection that the viewer will feel for the wily and wise Mordecai, who is certainly a rascal, but a surprisingly honorable one. Light entertainment? Most assuredly. But, it doesn't get any better than this.",976752000,12,2079,5.028985507246377
368668,5,6301801725,I shopped around for this classic movie. It takes me back to a simpler time.  For me it's an escape and George C Scott is fantastic.  All the other actors are good in there roles and the small town atmosphere adds to the story.  You can't go wrong with this one.,1423440000,,262,4.098039215686274
368669,5,6301801725,"One of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  Scott plays the part of a con-man, so completely scandalous he could even scam Obama into telling the truth for once in his lifetime.  I wish it was available, I'd certainly by a copy.  Scott cons a couple of old-maids into letting him use their convertible and completely destroys it.  When he gets done with it, it's just a piece of useless junk.  As I recall, he scams the local cops and gets another car.  When he starts it, he wraps the engine up as tight as it will go and holds the accelerator to the floor for seemingly hours, while the bystanders grit their teeth thinking the engine will blow - but it doesn't - hilarious!",1422748800,,676,4.368

368672,5,6301801725,This was the first George C. Scott movie I saw after Patton.  I did not expect much in the role of a comic actor.  I truly believe he was better in this than he was in Patton.  It was an outstanding performance. I only wish it had come out on DVD sooner.  thank you.,1413158400,,266,3.8703703703703702
368673,5,6301801725,"In the spring of 1967 a well-done sci-fi movie opened in theaters that (at the time) still ran a double-feature.  For those who have forgotten, or weren't here yet,  that's two movies in each showing (and for each admission price).  The sci-fi move told a classic Pierre Boule' story:  Planet of the Apes.  It was the top movie of the billing and starred Charlton Heston, Roddy McDowell, Kim Hunter and James Whitmore Junior.  Because CGI hadn't come along yet, the rubber ape masks held it back a bit and...it was good but not great.

But the second-bill movie was a gem, starring George C. Scott, Michael Sarrazin and a supporting cast of the best character actors of the day:  The Flim Flam Man.  We enjoyed Planet of the Apes, but have almost never watched it again, unlike Flim Flam Man, which we watch whenever we can find it.  It was, I think a best-of-career performance for both Scott and Morgan.  Better than Patton; better than MASH, better than Anatomy of a Murder or The Hustler.  An almost unknown classic, it was entirely unknown at the time.  If you like these actors, and if you like a classic comedy with belly laughs and a good thematic plot twist, this is for you.

My question:  Are there posthumous Oscars?",1401753600,2,1228,4.594470046082949
368674,5,6301801725,"Great acting, dialogue, action, and direction.  The story is so good and the plot development was second to none as being in line with the colorful flavor of how the theme was expressed.  True it is a sad ending, all be it a just one, yet there is room for the Flim Flam Man's young prot&eacute;g&eacute; for changing and improving by learning some hard lessons after it's all said and done.  George C. Scott gives a great performance and it's clear that the character he plays is too old and set in his ways to change, so you don't even consider that as a possibility.  You'll always have the sense of an inevitable tragic ending, yet you'll be wondering of how this occurs as you enthusiastically look forward to what happens in the proceeding scenes as they unfold.  Wildly entertaining, original, and a solidly nostalgic characteristic to it.  The picture quality is not of today's standards, obviously, yet you'll find that it gives it a stronger, rustic feel to it, as well as still having a colorful and exciting quality.",1401667200,,1028,4.683333333333334
368675,4,6301801725,"This movie is George C. Scott at his comedic best.  A great supporting staff, which includes Michael Sarrazin; Sue Lyon; Harry Morgan; Alice Ghostley; Jack Albertson; and Albert Salmi, among others, adds to this laugh 'til you drop comedy.  From the various cons perpetrated on the unsuspecting marks; the flim flam man and his cohort in crime traveling down a railroad track in a dilapidated old moonshine truck, just escaping an oncoming train; and the utter destruction of a town by a stolen...brand new off the showroom floor convertible, among other uproariously funny situations, make this movie a must buy and see for anyone who enjoys a good action packed comedy.  I inadvertently ordered the VHS tape, instead of the DVD I really had my heart set on buying, and found myself disappointed in both the picture and sound quality...and definitely would not recommend making a purchase of same.  Pay particular attention when ordering, on Amazon or elsewhere, that it is actually the DVD and not the VHS tape you're ordering!  Folks I just received the DVD of this movie, that I ordered soon after getting my VHS Tape, but found it would only play in one of the two the players I own.

The kid was 14, and a jock, and thought anything on Broadway was not he-man enough.  The play was titled, ""Sly Fox"" and it was probably the funniest thing I have seen in my 65 years on this earth.  My then Brother In Law never again missed the chance to see anything on Broadway.  I only wish a video of that incomparable performance was available somewhere because this great dramatic actor, was actually Brilliant at comedy.  I miss him dearly.
This movie is the nearest thing to the kind of part Scott played on that stage in New York, and it is very funny, even when I have seen it so often I know what's coming next.  The sequence with Slim Pickens is my personal favorite, then the 'get away' on the Railroad tracks in the truck.  If you have never seen this movie you are in for a treat.  It maybe a bit hokey in the new Millenium, but its not as far fetched as Harry Potter, and its a lot more fun.

Hats off to Screen Archives Entertainment for re-releasing this long unavailable masterpiece on DVD. Condolences to vendors selling old VHS tapes of The Flim-Flam Man for $100+.

The Flim-Flam Man will make you laugh out loud (guaranteed), and it will touch your heart via a great story, great acting, and very fitting music. George C. Scott was said to have called this his favorite role. I can see why.

One of the 100 greatest movies ever made, the Flim-Flam Man will be one of your favorites.

I purchased a copy of the new DVD, and this is NOT a bootleg DVD burned from a tape. It is a pristine, wide-screen, presentation!

2016 UPDATE:  I see the price is now back up over $100.  The lesson is to snap-up your DVDs SOON after limited releases come out.",1314144000,2,886,4.49375
368735,5,6301801725,"What I really loved about this comedy is the central concept by which George C. Scott's character justifies his actions.  Basically, he hustles the mark that falls into the trap of believing that Scott's character is a rube who the mark can con out of some money.  In attempting to con Scott, however, the mark must drop his guard and ends up being conned by Scott.  Scott's character points out this aspect of his technique to his young protege--showing that he is not really doing any real harm--just cheating the cheaters.  Because an honest man would not try to cheat him, he will not and cannot cheat an honest man.  In the end Scott's character runs afoul of things and does not confine his machinations solely to cheaters, but with hilarious results!",1305590400,,757,4.704545454545454

368739,5,6301801725,"I first saw this movie as a ""sneak preview"" (you do remember those) in 1967. Although I have forgotten the main attraction I went to see,I have never forgotten The Flim Flam Man. George C Scott's considerable talents were truly showcased in this film. While a wonderful comedy, I have always thought of this film as something of a morality play - a play that may speak to us even more more clearly after the events of the last several years.

I do not know why this film has not gained greater noteriety, but I am confident that this film will disappoint very few viewers.",1250294400,,572,4.447619047619048

368764,5,6301801725,"Like most of the people reviewing The Flim Flam Man I feel like I personally connected with this movie.  Its about a time, place and people that no longer exist and even back in 1967 I'm sure it was just dismissed as rural humor not up to the standards of urban folks. But as a young man growing up in Iowa I very much related to the male lead whose name I believe is Curly. He is a young man unable to fit into the world around him and is lead further astray by an old con man who despite his many crimes is a very sympathetic character. He needs Curly in order to survive but begins treating him like a son. Curly is torn between his affection for the old man and his desire to be a normal law-abiding human. Curly's saving grace is the young beautiful daughter of a man whose car is stolen by the flim flaming duo. She leads Curley back to the straight and narrow along with the forgiving nature of small town America in which a man can still redeem himself - couldn't happen in todays world. It doesn't surprise or bother me that very few care about this forgotten little gem. I just hope that when I die I can walk onto the set of The Flim Flam Man and never return.",1193270400,2,1171,4.11353711790393
368765,5,6301801725,"I don't own this movie but I have seen it a number of times and it is great! I highly recommend it. Better yet, I have a small personal connection to the film. At the very beginning of the film you will see a train entering a small town. That town is my hometown of Midway, KY which is near Lexington. Beautiful country. While the beginning of the movie was being filmed I was in my mid teens in and I was on location for the filming. I never forgot that event and I always make sure that I see the very beginning of the film to re-live that event. Great film.",1174348800,,560,4.008928571428571
368766,5,6301801725,"This movie should be required for anyone who is going into sales.  It is one of George C. Scott's finest, and most unappreciated films.  Slim Pickens also makes a great appearance.  It is a cinema text book on psychology.",1174348800,,221,4.615384615384615
368767,4,6301801725,"When this movie shows up on TV, I try to catch the opening just to hear the tender, lilting theme song as General Patton... I mean... crippled Mordecai the Flim Flam Man picks up his meager belongings spread alongside the train tracks, aided by a young army deserter who will become his student and uncertain ally in the world of the con game.

It's all set in the South but there's hardly a real Southerner in the cast (hell... Michael Sarrazin was from Quebec). Still, they all do a credible job and the dialog lilts much like the music.

And what a cast! The supporting actors provide more life and dimension then usual and they keep this film from becoming derailed by George C Scott's blustery caricature. Sad to say, this was Sue Lyon's last good role (despite coming early in her career). As in her earlier work, she shows a spirit to match her amazing looks. But this time, she isn't a tease. She's the girl you'd take home to meet the family.

There are just enuf drab scenes to keep this movie from attaining greatness. On the plus side, it has a lush, pastoral look (Irvin Kershner directed and Charles Lang d.p.'d), evocative music by Jerry Goldsmith, and a car chase that you may never forget. So it should be a 5-starrer for the first time viewer. A 4-starrer for old acquaintances.",1173571200,,1296,4.52991452991453

368812,5,6301801725,"This is a solid piece of Americana that never gets a bad review, even from within the ivory towers of IMDB's cinematic academe. Moreover, many critics rate the performance of Scott above that of Patton, the role for which he received Best Actor. Yet, in a 2002 interview, Peter Staddon of 20th Century Fox bluntly stated that there weren't any plans to release it on DVD. The movie's got a fan club, a fan web site, and memoriabilia on Ebay, yet the studio remains true to its bottom line and the fear that any money spent on digitization would result in a loss. I do not understand the politics nor the economies of this but wonder why these good people fear that this title would end up in the $5 bins of WalMart. Perhaps we, the loyalists of this film, are indeed too few to make a difference. It's disturbing how the dollar has canabilized this movie. What a crying shame.",1151193600,,876,4.447204968944099

The town has not changed much in the 30 years since -- most all of the buildings and locations are still readily identifiable even today.  The film has interesting characters and is really funny.  Hard to believe this is the same George C. Scott who did 'Patton' just 3 years later.  You really want to cheer on the bad guys in this film too.  Harry Morgan (Colonel Potter from MASH) as the Sheriff is pretty outrageous.  Only thing I fault in this film is that it isn't on DVD...

He thought my older brother and sister were old enough to appreciate it, so he invited them to watch it with him on TV. Next thing he knew, all 6 of us had our eyes glued to the set, howling with laughter at the slapstick, rooting for the con men (go figure :-) and saying ""eeewwww!"" when the young lovers kissed. I can't even count the number of times we've all seen this film since then. We truly grew up on it, and of course at every age, we got something new from it. It's not only funny (and really not overly slapsticky) but sweet and poignant.

As he tells his new sidekick, he holds a MSBSCSDD degree; that is:  Master of Back Stabbin' Cork Screwin' and Double Dealin'.  The two of them proceed to teach these lessons to a variety of suitable subjects, with rolling on the floor laughing results.  The car chase is possibly the funniest 8 minutes ever put on film.

Although I really liked the Apes movie, Flim-Flam Man has always been my all-time greatest comedy. It has been a struggle finding a copy on VHS, but I finally got one (used) 2 years ago on Ebay.
