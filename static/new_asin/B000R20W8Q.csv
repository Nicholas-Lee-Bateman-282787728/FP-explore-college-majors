8198445,5,B000R20W8Q,"Why isn't this DVD set sold for Region 1..?  The show has a large enough following to sell every region 1 DVD set that Amazon can sell and nobody can find another one?  Yeah, it is a little bit campy but that is part of its charm.  Hyperdrive is not just ""five stars"" for me, it is actually one of my all time favorites.",1449878400,6,320,3.96875
8198446,4,B000R20W8Q,At first I hated this and then it grew on me. Liked the ending.,1416268800,,63,3.5714285714285716
8198447,5,B000R20W8Q,On time and as advertised.,1405814400,,26,4.4
8198448,5,B000R20W8Q,"Certainly not for everyone, but I love it.

The main reason for posting the review is to mention that you can get the BBC import discs from Amazon.co.uk for much cheaper.

I'm not taking credit for this. I learned about it from HarryKerryJr's review of another BBC dvd set. I just want to spread the info.

I just received this set in only 5 days from amazon.co.uk for just under 1/2 price. Others have taken longer--up to 3 weeks--but if you can wait, I'd highly recommend getting it from amazon.co.uk.",1404086400,3,503,4.566666666666666
8198449,5,B000R20W8Q,The show was fantastic and it works in my region. Great value at $20 AU including postage. Thumbs Up from Me,1350691200,,108,4.190476190476191
8198450,5,B000R20W8Q,I have seen all episodes of seasons 1 and 2 - Love them all. Hilarious!! Cast is absolutely amazing and writing is great. Only negative is that there is no season 3 and no Region 1 (US) DVD.,1300924800,5,190,4.026315789473684
8198451,5,B000R20W8Q,"Great comedy sci-fi series - hard to compare with anything I've seen previously, but perhaps a tiny bit like ""The Office"" ... if the office were a starship with a not-terribly-good crew. I have a multi-region TV and DVD player to play it on, so when the kids come home for Christmas we have the annual 6-hour ""Hyperdrive holiday marathon"". Why, oh why, is it still not available in Region 1 (North American format) so I can get copies for my friends?",1294012800,9,450,4.5
