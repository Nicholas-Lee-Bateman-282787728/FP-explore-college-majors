8024630,5,B00029NM1I,"What can I say about Hi 5? Educational AND fun all rolled up in one! These are not just ""rainy day"" videos---they're ""any day"" videos for GREAT family fun!!! There is so much trash out there-waiting to corrupt our children and grandchildren. Their young minds are sponges-soaking up the good and the bad. But I encourage parents to keep their kids out of the malls-adding more unnecessary stuff to their lives-and gather together with a snack, clear the furniture from the middle of the floor-and jump, dance, prance with your children! Its times like these that are the best fun with the kids! NOT the countless trip to the mall or excessive trips to so many after school activities! Please  Spend more time with your children than them with the coach and ballet teacher!!!",1379980800,,774,4.776119402985074
8024631,4,B00029NM1I,"Is a great video. My daughter loves it.  Is hard to find videos of this kid's band at other stores. Let me tell you, is a very entertain and educative band for little kids and will keep your little ones jumping around, dancing, learning an having fun.",1316304000,,251,4.340425531914893
8024632,5,B00029NM1I,"Hi-5 is my daughter's favorite show and I highly recommend all their DVDs!  There are 3 very good episodes of Hi-5 on this DVD and the songs are quite catchy!  Unlike other children's shows, I can watch this multiple times and it does not get on my nerves.  This DVD is DEFINITELY worth purchasing!",1197331200,,298,4.481481481481482
8024633,5,B00029NM1I,My 4 year old son and I recently discovered hi-5 and are in love with the show. I bought him a couple of the dvd's and cd's for his 4th birthday. He asks to watch them all the time. I think he would sit and watch all day and night if I let him. I love the music just as much as he does. They are a wonderful group who teach through song and dance. I would recommend them to anyone with children.,1174003200,,395,3.7710843373493974
8024634,5,B00029NM1I,"My children are already in love with the Hi-5 gang after watching early morning TLC. Adding this DVD to our collection has proven to be beneficial in more than one way. Primarily, it is incredibly educational and catches the attention of my 4-year-old, as well as my 6-year-old. Other playmates of my children have given the same feedback...boys and girls, alike! I highly recommend ALL the Hi-5 DVD's!",1170288000,,402,4.926470588235294
8024635,5,B00029NM1I,"I was the mom saying ""no tv"" until we discoverd Hi-5.  My 1 1/2 year old loves Hi-5, and imitates their motions all day long.  The opening song on ""games"" involves hiding your eyes, counting to ten, and finding (running), which he loves acting out.  We enjoy singing, dancing, and acting it out together, not to mention the more peacful car rides it provides. Great shows on this tape dvd.",1143072000,2,389,4.5285714285714285
8024636,5,B00029NM1I,"Hi-5 has definitely held my 2 yr old son's attention!  The music and dancing at the beginning and end of each show are his favorite parts and he doesn't budge.  The rest of the segments are fun, upbeat and educational.  I believe this is one of the best shows for toddlers and I feel comfortable letting him watch it.",1128038400,2,317,4.338983050847458
