6412091,2,B00KB01P0S,"I have more than a few of Gabriel's DVDs. I would rate them all as 5*s. He is as funny on disc as he is in person. Then there is this compilation of other comedians coupled with animated shorts. It was almost painful to sit thru. I give it 2*s because there were threads of him throughout.
My take on this particular slapped together DVD was that it was a waste of money as well as my time.
No reflection upon him as a comedian. He is still  numero uno. This particular production was just far from being up to snuff.
I take the blame. Previous Amazon reviewers warned me...I just refused to listen.",1432339200,4,599,4.254385964912281

6412095,5,B00KB01P0S,"I think Gabriel has established the groove of the show at the end of season two, and season three (albeit short), definitely continues that trend. I think people don't mind seeing his buddy comedians, but most are there to see him, and as long as he has his bit in there at every show, I can surmise that the at-home crowd will be pleased, I was.",1422835200,,346,4.257575757575758

8657111,5,B00KB01P0S,"Fluffy is one of my favorite comedians and I always enjoy watching him perform, especially when he has new material. I just wish there was a series where it was mostly him performing and not a multitude of different comedians but your mileage may vary depending on who you like and who you don't. But still I enjoyed watching all the episodes for the cost I paid.",1450396800,,363,4.432835820895522
