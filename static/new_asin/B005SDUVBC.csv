4880602,3,B005SDUVBC,"My 2 year old grandson LOVES dinosaurs and Dino Dan. He really prefers the first Dino Dan DVD more than this one. There is one episode here done in a film noir style (black & white) that he hates and starts yelling, no no, when it comes on the screen. The remaining episodes are ok. My big problem with both of these DVDs is that they're very short. This entire DVD is only 60 minutes. But, if you have a child who loves dinosaurs, it's fine for only $10.",1336176000,5,455,4.123595505617978
