The geographical information and pictures of setting can be covered more effectively and professionally on a powerpoint presentation. The video consists mainly of charts and still pictures, while historical but often irrelevant events are narrated by a British guy who sometimes mispronounces names and places.",1272326400,,412,5.453125
8114145,1,B000ETRABO,I wanted to love this video but unfortunately all of the videos in this series are so very boring! My high school students were so disappointed. The videos are informative but not in a way that would cause excitement or interest in the classroom. I was ready to turn it off within the first 15 minutes.,1217894400,,302,4.410714285714286
