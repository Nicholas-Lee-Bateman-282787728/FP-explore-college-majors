7613942,5,B01AXLIDPE,Got this for the educational aspect  - didn't disappoint.  Highly recommend.,1475193600,,76,5.818181818181818
7613943,4,B01AXLIDPE,"We first found out about Thomas Edison's Secret Lab on our local PBS station. My two oldest boys are huge fans of science and technology, so this type of video is right up their alley. It has eight short episodes (for a total DVD run time of 90 minutes).

The videos themselves are rather fast paced, but my kids find them entertaining. They really try to make scientific concepts understandable for young kids. Some of it probably goes over my five-year-old's head, but I know that they're picking up on some of the basics.

I'm a big fan of entertainment that educates. If my kids are going to be sitting in front of a screen for thirty minutes, I want them to walk away learning something. There is music video in each episode which help to reinforce concepts.

If you haven't seen it before, it's easy to find clips online that will let you check it out first.",1475107200,,864,4.455696202531645
7613944,5,B01AXLIDPE,"When my grandsons come for a sleepover, we always have movie night. Its getting harder and harder to find something acceptable they haven't seen yet so this came at a good time. It doesnt hurt that they both love cartoons and science. The episodes kept them entertained. Five Stars.",1475107200,,282,4.775510204081633
7613945,5,B01AXLIDPE,"My child loves this DVD.  It's fun, entertaining, and there lots of learning involved.  Well worth it!",1474934400,,102,4.9411764705882355
7613946,5,B01AXLIDPE,I got this for my three year old nephew when he is over.  he loves the songs and the dancing. You also get to learn some cool science facts along the way.  Through animation and dance he is learning while having fun.,1474675200,,216,4.119047619047619
7613947,4,B01AXLIDPE,"This is (apparently) the second volume/season of a cartoon series designed to teach kids science in a painless way, a task it seems to accomplish handily with some (VERY basic) animation and reasonably smart scroting that makes concepts clear without talking down to the audience (NOT the easiest thing to do, and a major accomplishment)

The series itself appears to be available on a variety of apps and certain PBS stations (none in my area) so keep your eyes peeled

This batch of eight (approximately 12 minute) episodes treats such subjects as Remote Control, Gravity, Nanobots and a host of others with (juvenile) wit and information.

A few caveats, though: Despite the way some of the copy may read, this is NOT a 90 minute film but, as I note, 8 separate ones; some of the ""explanations"" parts of some episodes may be a bit dense or, conversely, over-simplified; the ""backstory"" of how the kids even get to the ""secret lab"" is apparently covered on the first series an not on this one (no big deal, actually); and the box ""notes""  conclude with the phrase ""... will show kids just how fun science can be"" which is a egregious neologism and should NEVER be used by thinking people of ANY age!)

On the other han, the set costs under $6. One of the TRUE bargains available today",1474329600,,1286,4.647577092511013
7613948,5,B01AXLIDPE,"This is a great DVD! I got this for my son (5yr old) for some added educational entertainment. He has sit through several episodes already hanging on every word because he sees it as a fun cartoon not realizing that he is actually learning. The first episode teaches about how remotes use electromagnetic waves to communicate with the actual device to make it do a specific task. In the cartoon, one of the characters use a suit to control a robots dancing during a competition. But in the end, the robot forfeits the win once he finds out he was cheating -- so two lessons in one.  It's an entertaining and educational series. Highly recommend to parents of young kids.",1473984000,,670,4.583333333333333
7613949,4,B01AXLIDPE,"I liked it a lot. My kids liked it, but they find Magic School Bus much better. I cannot figure out why that is the case because this seems so much more interesting, and the graphics are modern.

Never the less, I still think this should be a staple in any home with small kids. Get them interested in science so they focus on STEM.",1473897600,,332,4.107692307692307
7613950,5,B01AXLIDPE,"Science is a blast in the newest release of Thomas Edison's Secret Lab: Rock It To the Moon! This is the second DVD is this great new cartoon series that mixes learning with laughs. Kids will learn about scientific phenomena and concepts as well as some of the great minds who have made major breakthroughs in the field. This release, with an approximate running time of 90 minutes, not only includes eight great episodes, but also eight exciting music videos that will have kids up and moving as well as humming the tunes all day long. The best thing about this series is the way it creates interest in further exploration of the topics that are covered on the show. I really appreciate how varied the episode content is as far as incorporating scientific laws and theories with new concepts regarding technological advances and engineering. The topics presented in this release range from moon rocks to remote control contraptions! The episodes included are Dancing Machine, Murphy's Law of Gravity, Rock It To the Moon, Act Your Stone Age, Von Drop-Out,  Freaky Furry, The Monster Not Under the Bed and Nanobots Byte. My kids give this DVD two thumbs up, and they are anxiously awaiting the next installment of this super science show!

7613951,5,B01AXLIDPE,"About the Product:

 Join Angie and friends as they deal with everything from a remote control dance outfit to gravity to moon rocks and more! Hoping to get on a dance show, Von Bolt wears a remote-control dance outfit. But if he let's someone else dance for him, is he really a winner? Next, the Secret Lab Kids are ready to demo their new science song for web entrepreneur, Mook Zookerboom, when he learns that a satellite is coming down out of orbit, panics and heads for the airport. So the team must gather some data on gravity to convince him to return. Then, when Von Bolt accidentally destroys the museum's new moon rock, the Secret Lab Kids must find a way to replace it. Guided by fun-loving Edison, Angie and friends will show kids just how fun science can be!

My Review:

 Science can be fun! And N Circle Entertainment can prove it by their many product releases that challenge and engage young minds as well as entertain them. They have lots of fun DVD's that are all fun and games which appeal to young children but the magic that comes with each of these products is that each child can learn something fun and interesting.

 In their latest, Thomas Edison's Secret Lab: Rocket To the Moon DVD, join Angie and the Secret Lab Kids as they go on some very wild and Science filled adventures where they discover Von Bolt's accident and they have to work together to figure out how to fix it. With some very sweet and very memorable characters your children will definitely learn how fun science really is.

**Disclosure** This product was sent to me free of charge for my honest review from the author.",1461110400,,1616,4.529209621993127
8748838,5,B01AXLIDPE,"Fun and educational, the younger kids really enjoy watching this!",1519084800,,65,5.6
8748839,4,B01AXLIDPE,This is a decently entertaining DVD for younger children.  The educational portion is minimal but it does stimulate some scientific curiosity.  The actual cartoon features a nice degree of diversity so all kids feel included.  The scenarios are not the most entertaining for adults but kids did find it fun.  Older children probably will not be amused but younger kids will enjoy this DVD,1514592000,,388,5.015625
8748840,2,B01AXLIDPE,"Meh, as others have mentioned, don't bother, or rather there are so many other shows that are better and more actually science based than this thing.",1498348800,,149,4.769230769230769
8748841,3,B01AXLIDPE,"Was this my favorite cartoon? No. It's a little corny and annoying for my tastes. Did my children like it? Yes. They have been completely fascinated with it, which surprises me. I'm one of those people that believes, in general, that if something isn't good enough for parents to enjoy, it's not good enough for children, either. (There's always exceptions!) That said, I still let my children watch ""candy"" programs, and while I'd consider this one of them, at least they're getting a little science lesson into the mix. (I wouldn't get this solely expecting a science lesson, though!)

This isn't something we'll be watching a great deal, but it's an okay way to pass a rainy day. I think it will be more children approved than parent approved, overall.",1488240000,,755,4.8076923076923075
8748842,5,B01AXLIDPE,"The star rating was chosen by my 8 year old grandson. He says that he learned that gravity keeps you from flying into the air and that
dust mites only like dust bunnies (I didn't even know that!)
So it was entertaining and educational for him. It might not be perfect, but if you child learns something from it, it is well worth the time
compared to what they might be watching on T.V.",1483833600,,385,4.216216216216216
8748843,2,B01AXLIDPE,"Given the choice between watching this and Peabody's Improbable History with Sherman, I'd strongly suggest going for Peabody.",1477785600,,125,6.0
8748844,4,B01AXLIDPE,"This is kind of a plain old 30 minute kids TV show (ie. Shorter than 30 minutes each).  Plot lines don't directly involve science, but the kids work in a lab and so use science to get things done and the songs are about science.  For example, in one episode, the robot from the lab will appear on a dance contest TV show.  He's a terrible dancer, and the kids in the lab don't want him made fun of, so they use a remote control suit to help him dance without him knowing.  The songs are all about how remote control works.  Educational value is minimal.  When I asked my 3 year old if he knew what remote controls were after he watched, he didn't seem to know, and instead said he learned that robots are bad at dancing.

These did keep the 3 year old entertained, but the bar is low given the type of thing he'll watch on YouTube.

Overall, this is ok filler if you'd like something to have around to keep a child quiet for 30 minutes (using video like this is not good for creativity, but gotta do things for me or that just gotta get done).  I suspect that the songs could passively get into a child's memory and then later they could spew a random fact about gravity or something, but it's not a science education by itself.",1477699200,,1228,4.191489361702128
8748845,2,B01AXLIDPE,"Everything's STEM this and STEM that these days, so you can't blame people for trying to make a STEM cartoon. Heck, half the toys in stores now claim to teach STEM concepts, sometimes in absurd ways.

So this cartoon has a bunch kid-scientist (with a nice gender and ethnic diversity) who solve problems with science. Sure, sounds good. Except the 'problems' are things like 'our robot is entering a dance contest', and their solutions are things like 'cheat by building a suit to let someone else dance for the robot'.

The kids weren't engaged at all.

I was, well, disappointed a few times over. The science is really just pasted on, you could snip the little 30-second bits where they 'explain' (sorta, but not really) the scientific basis for that episode's scienceing and it would change anything. Plus, the science is basically magic - they just decide to make something and boom it's done, then goes on to obey the rules of cartoon physics. And remember the whole cheating thing i mentioned? Yeah, not a good message for kids.",1477008000,3,1034,4.76536312849162
8748846,3,B01AXLIDPE,"Thomas Edison's Secret Lab: Rock it to the Moon is a series of 8 episodes on one DVD. Each episode covers a different scientific process or invention and introduces scientists from various time periods. It's kind of primitive in the animation department but it does have decent music and every episode has a song at the end that's about the topic of the episode.

The series stars 4 science minded kids, their German robot and their ghostly guide, Thomas Edison.

I'm sorry that Amazon considers a 3 star review to be negative because to me, it means ""it's okay."" This DVD isn't especially engaging but it's not awful, either. I do like that in the songs and throughout the episodes, they display the lyrics and also key words and info. This is great for my granddaughter, who is a new reader.

The price is certainly reasonable and the content is okay. Just don't expect it to become a favorite.",1476662400,,896,4.622641509433962
8748847,3,B01AXLIDPE,"When Amazon offered this product to me in exchange for an objective review as part of its Vine Reviewer program (where they send the products to selected reviewers), I requested one  I saw that it might have something to do with the genius inventor, Thomas  Edison. As I watched the eight 9-minute episodes I saw a character called Edison but I really didn't know why he was there. And, in most cases I would guess that the young children to who this set is aimed, would have known who Edison was  or why he was even there. These are science subjects and Edison was more an inventor than a scientist.

It appears from other reviews I see here that this is the second in a series of DVDs from this company and that the backstory of the secret lab is covered in the previous volume. I haven't seen that, but it might have made more sense to me if I had.

The entertainment value (for the price) is good.  The animation reminds me of a low grade Hanna-Barbara cartoon and the music is catchy. In fact, in addition to the eight episodes, there are eight music videos

I think kids would enjoy the colorful pictures and the music , though  with a lot of the scientific concepts using big words  Im not sure they will learn a lot.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
