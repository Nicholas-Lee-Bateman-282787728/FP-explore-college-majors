5012196,1,B006PA0WF2,"This is just ridiculous. They released volume 1, then 2, then 3, each at full price. Now, they are releasing these three volumes together without even completing the season package, so that they can release it all yet again in a few months with more episodes. What are these execs smoking?",1330473600,134,289,4.686274509803922
5012197,1,B006PA0WF2,"Sorry folks,the Complete 1st Season would consist of 26 episodes not 13. At best this is cobbled together Season 1 Part 1. Cartoon Network is no better, they are airing the rest of the 1st season as the beginning of the 2nd season.
I'll wait for a complete release or just keep the episodes I recorded off of Comcast on demand.",1330128000,170,327,4.377049180327869
5012198,4,B006PA0WF2,"I saw that amazon's release date in april 17 I guess Walmart has an exclusive on the package I bought it said for a limited time while supplies last.  I was happy that the disk are one sided, I know how the WB likes their double sided disk.  There's no special features just the episodes, and no book, the disk are in a hard plastic case, no over lapping disk, the disk have there own plastic casing

If you want to save 35 cents and wait two months, but if your like me head to your local walmart, I got the last of two copies so they could be flying off the selves.

This is not the full first season!

The full season is 26 episodes, I believe it will take a while for them to get a full first season pack,  Warner brothers has been getting a lot of flack for their volumes as of late, and I'm one of the people giving them the most I felt confident buying this product because of how Warner Brothers handled the recent release of Scooby Doo Mystery Incorporated, after releasing the first season part one in 3 volumes and getting a lot  of backlash over it, they released the rest of the season in a three disk pack.

I just watched all 12 ep's and they are so good,",1329955200,6,1170,4.100877192982456
5012199,5,B006PA0WF2,"Firstly, WB released the volumes for this first season in sets of 4: season 1, vol1, season 1, vol2 and season 1 vol. 3 (to be released in a couple of weeks). People cried foul!, because of the pricing (about 15 bucks, sometimes 11). Now, WB finally listened to its consumers, released a complete season set (a barebone one, but I digress) and people are still crying foul!! Unbelievable.

Look, this is a nice set. If you are a fan of the series, buy it. As this title racks up more sales, chances are that they will release a Blue-Ray, with more stuff at some point.",1328486400,5,568,4.3584905660377355
5012200,3,B006PA0WF2,"After the diehard fans or the unknowing fans already paid over thirty dollars to own these cheap no special features standard definition episodes of this otherwise excellent series, now they have set up a release for all three volumes together at less than half the price. They do this BEFORE the third volume is even released separately, which makes no sense since there is only a 3 dollar price difference (even if you already bought the previous 2 volumes you'd be just as well buying this bundle and giving the other two away/selling them for cheap or whatnot). Nice move WB, nice move. Hardly anyone is left to buy this since those who are holding out for the season release this series deserves won't and most of those who will pay for the episodes alone in standard definition have already shelled out the cash. The company has basically insulted those individuals who already tried to support them even more than it already has. I know nobody likes a rant but I love this show and hope it will get the release it deserves, that's why I at least gave this product 3 stars (though the series clearly deserves a 5 star release).

Anyways I will give credit where credit is due (another reason for the 3 stars), had they released the series this way in the first place it would've been a great move in the right direction, customers shouldn't have to pay more than a dollar or two per episode without special circumstances and this collection mostly rectifies that. I still personally hope for a proper release and some sort of special features. If we aren't getting blu-ray or even some special features then I would at least like a set that collects the whole season or the season in two parts at an affordable price.

This is a great show that needs to be supported but don't let companies think they can rip off customers with constant rereleases without even throwing them a bone, they could at least have added something new in this bundle to make it more worthwhile, even a cheap trinket. On the positive side maybe this is the first step in the right direction. If you really want to support this show maybe just be sure to watch the episodes whenever they air on television to keep ratings up and put as much traffic on the official site, etc. as you can. Those are two basically free (other than provider fees obviously) ways to support this series and keep it on the air. Great series, deserves a great release in my opinion.",1327449600,124,2440,4.568493150684931

5012221,5,B006PA0WF2,"Okay... wow. I don't know how else to describe this show. It is just phenomenal. Young Justice is about 3 young sidekicks: Robin, Kid Flash, and Aqualad. They are tired of being treated like second-class heroes, and strike out on there own. In the process, they bring new member Superboy, and he is soon followed by Miss Martian and Artemis. This show is serialized instead of starting a whole new thing in each episode. I had never read any DC comics prior to watching this, but they made it very easy to follow and understand. The characters were unique, and the plot was well-written. Action-packed, and sprinkled with comedy, drama, and even romance, I recommend Young Justice to kids, teens, DC fans, and people that like good TV shows.",1438560000,4,741,4.751937984496124

5012223,4,B006PA0WF2,"Excellent series, well packaged. Well written episodes with dynamic subplots.

My only problem with the series is that it seems a bit heavily weighted towards Superboy.  His subplots get more screen time than the subplots of the rest of the team combined, but the main plots carry the show.  There is also the group plot of the strained dynamics between the adult and teenaged superheroes.  The Justice League is portrayed as a clear force for good, but also unknowable, distant, and frightening.  That's a very realistic portrayal.

My only real issue with the DVD set is why they just couldn't sell all of season one in a single set.",1430697600,,635,4.779816513761468

5012245,5,B006PA0WF2,"The Teen Titans was a very similar comic book to this and a similar cartoon as well. The older version of The Teen Titans was more gritty and teenage. The newer version of The Teen Titans is more childish and comedy. Young Justice, thank goodness, is a welcome switch back to the first animated Teen Titans that I remember watching. MUCH more grit and violence. Imagine Robin martial arts fighting Slade in an extended battle while Slade is possessed by Raven's demon father. How is that for action?! THAT is the first cartoon of The Teen Titans and now Young Justice. No cutesy funny storylines like the newer Teen Titans which is more like The Powerpuff Girls. Teen superpower angst! Trained by the Justice League Unlimited, Young Justice is like 21 Jumpstreet in that they are very young heroes. Robin, Kid Flash, and Aqualad are all invited to the Hall of Justice to save Superboy, a ""clone"" of Superman, from a laboratory. Martian Manhunter's female version called Miss Martian joins the team along with Artemis, a Green Arrow style female hero. They build a new base called Mt. Justice embedded in a mountain in the U.S just for the younger team but keep the Hall of Justice for the elders(Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman, etc.). As they learn how to better use their abilities much like the New Mutants in Marvel Comics fame, they run into seriously strong enemies like androids, wizards, and robots. Some names you will DEFINITELY recognize! These heroes are the future of the Superfriends/Justice League!",1408752000,,1512,4.864341085271318

The show is still great and looks great, but I find having three DVDs for just the first half of season one is a hassle. At least it was cheaper than iTunes.

5012287,5,B006PA0WF2,"I am hooked on this series starting on Episode 1.  It provides a fresh look at the superheroes from serious teen perspectives, unlike previous attempts like Teen Titans and other 90s young heroes short takes.  The drama is quite suspenseful and the storyline arcs across many episodes, much like the Justice League, but with much less death and impossible violence.  Sure, the teen heroes are capable of taking down whole buildings, but not the entire city blocks like those final epic battle between Superman and Darkseid in Justice League.",1375660800,,541,5.056179775280899

And once you've experienced the awesomeness, please feel free to join in the letter writing campaign to have them produce a third season or even a movie! Trust me, once you've seen the series you'll jump at the chance to inform the ""powers that be"" that they cut this short WAY too soon!",1374883200,,526,4.5473684210526315

I also like how this show has actual plots and characters you care about.

Despite that, it works. The writing is solid, although a little conspiracy heavy.

The other thing that bothered me about this collection is that it is only approx half of season one. However, for the price, and the quality of the writing, I'd recommend it.",1368316800,,509,4.521739130434782

Young Justice, and its second season Invasion, are brilliantly written and, despite this, being cancelled after falling under Cartoon Network's rule of killing shows when enough episodes are made to run them in syndication (Ben 10 and [adult swim] aside). Interestingly enough, as Weisman creates critically acclaimed and cult-followed series that end before their time, the creator is often compared to Joss Whedon of the Avengers and Buffy the Vampire Slayer fame. It is highly recommended to purchase this series, mostly because you won't regret it, but also because it may very well give the series the push necessary for DC Comics to fight for its return.

5012317,5,B006PA0WF2,"I enjoyed Young Justice for its plot line, characters, and background and introductions of not so much known characters. There are three DVDS with four episodes in each one. Many people do complain about it not being the full season but beggars can't be choosers. Currently Young Justice is in Season Two and Part One is will be out in January which contains ten episodes. Right now there is no release of a one set of Season one. To me I'm alright with it because it does beat the DVDs separately. The price is reasonable for twelve episodes considering how low the price is now. The DVDs do not include anything except episodes and trailers and mini preview comics. If they do release a season box, it may have commentary, behind the scenes or even the DC shorts. Maybe that might encourage you to wait but I just want to watch Young Justice all the time like the geek I am. I did buy Part Two so I do have a full season of episodes. I'm not asking for much.

Each of the disks has a picture cover or art. Disk one is my favorite because it is a collage of the YJ team while the other two are a bit plain. The first disk sates YOUNG JUSTICE season one * volume one. It has from left to right: Robin, Aqualad, Kid Flash (Top), Miss Martian (Bottom), Superboy (Top) and Artemis (Bottom). The color is red and the DC comics and WB emblems are on the disk also. The second disk has the art work of a spiderweb or the rays of the light and is orange while the third disk looks reminds me a computer in red. The cover of the DVD is simple and bold. Since it hold all three disks of Young Justice from volumes 1 to 3 it has all the artworks from the DVD covers. The case itself is pretty sturdy but do not step on it or lean on it. I invited a friend over one day and that was when my disks came in the mail. She was being herself and sat her arm over the box which had to bubble wrap at all. I discovered this when I opened it. The case Is clear but the containment inside seems a little weak. The end piece securing the disks broke. So be mindful and careful.
There's no extra paper entailing which disk is what but that's because it's on the back.

Main Menu in all the Disks is a picture of the team. From left to right: Robin, Artemis, Kid Flash, Superboy, Miss Martian, and Aqualad. Everybody looks serious and in the background is the theme of Young Justice. The main menu has all the basic buttons: Play, Episodes, Tailors, and Settings.
Maybe you want to watch all the episodes, click play. It starts from the beginning of the DVD depending on which DVD you play.
If you only want to see a particular episode, choose episodes. The background is Aqualad in fighting mode.
Trailers are trailers. The background is Kid Flash in action mode.

Settings are if you are bilingual or curious to see how it sounds in Spanish, Portugoal or French. There are subtitles if you want to know what was said. The background is Robin hacking the motion sensors.

When I did a search on Amazon for ""Young Justice Complete first season"" and this product was at the top of the list, so I bought it.  It arived today and I see that not only was Amazon's search results misleading ('misleading'?, try DEAD WRONG) but the DVD collection that took way to long to get to me (in my opinion) is only HALF of what I was lead to believe it was going to contain.  So basically all of the heavy stories that happen later in the season are NOT in this collection.

The search should've read like the old searches used to: ""Couldn't find that, but these were CLOSE to what you wanted"" which would've alerted me to prepare for only half of what I wanted to arrive.

I feel what makes this show so great, is that unlike a show like Teen Titans is the fact that these young heroes are incorporated with their senior counterparts. They face the same rogues galleries as they do and have just as many life/death situations. Along with being teenagers it adds an extra dimension to them characters and heroes. The packaging for this dvd set and even the following dvd with the rest of the first season is stupid. Still, the show itself makes you forget about all that junk. Watch this show it is fantastic!

That alone lent great credibility to the serious effort the producer and all the worker bees put into the series.  For the episodes themselves and the plot lines, I have no criticisms.  I get along with most of WB's animated series.  They need to treat the fans - read ""customers"", you know, the ones with MONEY - better and not be so stinkin' greedy.

5012337,5,B006PA0WF2,"I ordered this on a whim. My grandkids told me it was ""really good"". They were right. I am surprised at how well written the stories are and having an arc story run through is very clever. The first half of the season has kept my interest and I am looking forward to the second half.
The show is based on the premise that the sidekicks of DC are now going to be  memebers of the Justice League. To say more would be a spoiler. The show is well animated and keeps you interested.
DC animated is always a pleasure to watch and I still enjoy the shows and comics.",1343692800,3,560,4.090909090909091
5012338,4,B006PA0WF2,This what I wanted the Teen Titans animated series to be like. Solid animation and so far great stories. Well worth watching if your a DC animated fan.,1342742400,2,151,4.428571428571429
5012339,4,B006PA0WF2,"Onlookers commenting on the Justice Leaguers and their sidekicks as they're seen entering the Hall of Justice:

- ""I see Flash and Flash Jr.""
- ""His name's Speedy.""
- ""No, Speedy's Green Arrow's sidekick.""
- ""Well, that makes no sense.""

It still rankles that them numbers-crunching corporate suits are still punking the audience with their measly four-episodes-per-volume release. But, okay, this is more like it. This set collects the three volumes of YOUNG JUSTICE Season One that were originally separately released and now allows us to view the first twelve eps. I can't say that YOUNG JUSTICE is the overall best cartoon on air right now because, for one thing, LEGEND OF KORRA and TRANSFORMERS PRIME are also kicking copious butt. And then, as a superhero animated show, it runs neck and neck with THE MIGHTY AVENGERS and GREEN LANTERN.

Disaffected by the Justice League's unwillingness to treat them as equal partners, determined to step out of their mentors' shadows, sidekicks Robin, Aqualad, and Kid Flash found Young Justice. Investigating shady shenanigans at the mysterious Cadmus Project, the kids free and enlist Superman's angry teen clone. Looking to impose some control over their protgs, the Justice League relents and sets up Young Justice in their old cave sanctuary, with Black Canary as their combat trainer, Batman as the group's mission coordinator, and Red Tornado as, er, den mother.

Oh, man, so many things to like about YOUNG JUSTICE. The animation is superb. Plenty of characters from the DC universe drop in, including an assortment of Justice Leaguers. Thankfully, the tone isn't as frivolous as the TEEN TITANS cartoon a few years ago. There's an edginess to the show and enough welcome nods to past DC story arcs and concepts (Bialya, the history between Red Arrow and Cheshire, etc.).

I never read the YOUNG JUSTICE comics of some years ago, so I can't say how closely this show clings to that. I do know that the group dynamics on the show is really interesting as Young Justice is made up of diverse personalities. Maybe the most intriguing element is that Robin, even though only 13 years old, boasts the most crimefighting experience. But he's not team leader (maybe it's that annoying giggle of his). I like Kid Flash's understated scientific mind and Miss Martian's charming naivet and the pugnacious fight in Arrowette.

Aqualad is a new character who makes his debut in the cartoon and who, just about simultaneously, is officially adapted by Geoff Johns into the DC comic book universe (in BRIGHTEST DAY #4). Like Aquaman's wife, Mera, this Aqualad can shape hard water into weapons. He's the oldest member of Young Justice and, okay, the blandest of the bunch. Another element that was created for the show is the shadowy consortium known as the Light. This group's unending behind-the-scenes orchestrating provides a season-long thru arc.

The show packs in plenty of laughs to balance out the hellacious action sequences and the solid character beats. For one thing, I love how Superboy arrives at his civilian name ""Connor Kent."" I guess it's inevitable that teen crushes would surface and that the show would explore various romantic entanglements. Do I forfeit my man card when I admit to rooting for Kid Flash and Arrowette?

And then as if the show's isn't awesome enough, Season 2 inserts a hell of a swerve, skipping five years ahead and exploring the resulting (and fairly sweeping) changes.

Still, a one star demerit for this set's not collecting the full season. But I like this show so much I have to give it at least 4 stars.

Season One's first twelve episodes:

- ""Independence Day"" - In the first of a two-parter, the JLA and their sidekicks take on a slew of ice-oriented villains. Later, unsupervised, the sidekicks sneak into the Cadmus Project and run into enough clones to make Peter Parker nervous.

- ""Fireworks"" - Superboy, a brainwashed captive at the Cadmus Project, strikes out for independence. The kids and the JLA come to an uneasy accord.

- ""Welcome to Happy Harbor"" - ""Hel-lo, Megan!"" The adorable Miss Martian joins the team and may or may not be a liability in the team's desperate scrap against Mr. Twister. Anyway, her bio-ship is wicked cool.

- ""Drop Zone"" - Batman deploys Young Justice to the remote island of Santa Prisca on a recon mission. While members argue over who is team leader, there's Bane over there pulling strings with wicked glee.

- ""Schooled"" - When Superman persists in ignoring Superboy, Superboy's anger manifests and threatens to sabotage Young Justice's latest mission, and when that latest mission involves Amazo... oboy.

- ""Infiltrator"" - This episode's title, on the surface, refers to the nano-machines that can eat away at any object as well as steal secret data files. In hindsight, the ep title may refer to someone else. Introducing Young Justice's newest member, the in-your-face Arrowette.

- ""Denial"" - When Dr. Fate goes up against a Lord of Chaos, can Wally West keep up his steadfast naysaying of magic?

- ""Downtime"" - As the other Young Justice heroes take a load off, Aqualad must make a fateful decision whether to stay with the team or return to Atlantis. Also, a welcome sighting of Garth and Tula.

- ""Bereft"" - Batman deploys the team to the contentious nation of Bialya to investigate an extraterrestrial presence. In Bialya the team suffers memory loss, causing them to forget the past six months. Also, Superboy inadvertently gets a pet.

- ""Targets"" - A Red Arrow-centric ep. In Taipei, Taiwan, Red Arrow ends up playing reluctant bodyguard to Lex Luthor, who is the new mediator in the peace summit of two warring countries. Meanwhile, Superboy and Miss Martian attends their first day in high school. Also, a Wendy and Marvin sighting.

- ""Terrors"" - To unearth a possible plot in Belle Reve prison involving ice-themed supervillains (Captain Cold, Mr. Freeze, Killer Frost, Icicle Jr.), Superboy and Miss Martian pose as meta-convicts who get sentenced to Belle Reve prison.

- ""Home Front"" - With the team's super-powered members held hostage by Red Tornado's sinister relations, it's up to Robin and Artemis to stage a rescue attempt. If you're a fan of Arrowette, this ep's for you.",1341792000,8,6229,4.957773512476008
5012340,5,B006PA0WF2,"I do agree that Warner should have just released the whole complete season and not confuse people with just releasing volumes, but, the name of the game is money, and apparently it ust be working because they continue to do so.  Releasing volumes does allow the shows to be released quicker, because they no longer have to wait for the show to end b4 releasing them anymore.  So, it does have a place, even if you don't agree with it.

But, you should not leave negative feedback for the show/content based on that, you dont' like it, don't buy it and contact Warner.  People see the poor ratings and migh think the show is not worth buying and that's just not true.  Give a rating based on the show, and then in the review mention it's not the complete season.",1340841600,3,761,4.4071428571428575
5012341,5,B006PA0WF2,"I purchased this boxset the day before pre-order ended, directly after I finished watching all of Season 1. Although this set IS only half of season 1, $13.99 really isn't that bad for a new release boxset. The second half is currently on pre-order, and I'm awaiting it's arrival after release. $28.00 for a full season is pretty typical, so no complaints.

This show was good enough for me to buy the sets brand new. Typically I buy DVD boxsets here on Amazon used because I'm not one to pay full price for things as I rarely have money on hand to blow on my DVD/Book collection.

Young Justice is one of those shows where several age groups can enjoy it. It was paced well, and not overly childish, nor 'old' enough to get children confused at parts.

Some comic fans were perturbed that this series did not start off true to the comics at all (wrong cast), but with the introduction of Season 2, a lot of that anger can be put to rest as most of the original cast from the comics make their appearance. Some plot elements still deviant, but as with all cartoon/movie/tv series adaptations, that should be expected.

Aqualad - Sure seems like the Gary Stu of the show - the most competent, the leader, everyone loves him (though he does get dumped).

Superboy - Hate, hate, hate him. The emo thing is so old.

Ms. Martian - Of course, she falls for Superboy and his whining. That and she is too much like Starfire from Teen Titans.

Artemis - like the character more I see of her.

Robin - Like the super hacker role. Makes a lot of sense for him, kind of a cross of Robin and Sailor Mercury. Though his dialogue can be painful, but I suppose that is tradition.

Wally - I'm not a fan of genius Wally, but haven't seen a version of Wally I didn't like yet.

Speedy - On the other hand, never seen a version of Speedy I like.

Superman - Another character determined to be a jerk. Really wanted Batman to give him a beat down.

Chesire - Her, I like. Let's see much more about her.

The Doctor Fate episode - get for this, if nothing else. Great background for Doctor Fate. So stealing it.

I do appreciate the overarcing storyline. Also, the subtitles give away the villains in the Light. Just a word of warning. It's not Justice League, but I thought it was worth the price.",1335571200,3,1295,4.223577235772358

5012362,4,B006PA0WF2,"Having set aside time to watch Avengers as its first season progressed. I put off watching Young justice.
I thought the individual DVD volumes were a little high priced when they came out. Also the program was inconceivably hard to catch on reruns or streamed. So I wasn't even sure if I liked the show to justify picking up the single volumes.

 A combination of those first twelve episodes at this lower price and a need to finally actually watch the series. pushed me to order this.

For standard definition. The shows animation really holds up when filling a high definition widescreen display. because the show is in the widescreen aspect ratio and anamorphicly fits like a film. You can tell there are some artifact jaggies at first but only if you look closely. This may have something to do with a high quality encode as the disc isn't as crammed with episodes as other series can jam onto a disc at lower quality. That's a good point.

One negative point is that the first volume came off the tray in shipping at some point. Creating some minor scratches as it rattled around. But it wasn't enough to damage the video playback.
The tray has kind of weak prongs for holding the discs and the first disc actually fell off on another occasion. So negative point is that the trays are kind of cheap.

The show itself is actually very complex. playing off of classic DC comic tropes of Sidekicks and more Adult Role Model heroes that crippled DC when Other companies made more Teen Heroes that were easier to identify with readers. Young Justice is refreshing, for not making another teen titans like I expected. But for making new Heroes from the familiar Justice League archetypes, Their problems are their flaws that make them more relate able than their mentors and they handle more covert missions under batman. For a nice element of Spy Fiction. But tons of fan flavor obscure Heroes and Villains pop up, usually re imagined for this world of superhero Espionage. And the conspiracy's of shadowy organizations help give each missions success a less episodic feel. Its all building towards something, that keeps you going forward and anticipating the team to uncover more of the truth. Or at least not tear itself apart.
Even though I enjoyed Justice League unlimited and was a little jarred at first by the art of this series. But it is a solid technical achievement for modern cell animation. There is some computer modeled assistance going on. It doesn't stand out. But its there if you want to look for it.

Recommend you pick up this three pack if your new to young Justice like me. It was well worth the price. Its possible that later volumes will be back at full price. Not holding out for a season set. Honestly after watching a ton of DC, cartoons in the past and now this. I'm genuinely pleased by this entry.",1333411200,3,2828,4.646
5012363,1,B006PA0WF2,"Young Justice is a very good show.  Not as good as Justice League was, but a good substitute none-the-less.  This particular incarnation occurs within DC Earth 16; what does that mean?  Well if you are familier with the DC Multiverse concept that has been reintroduced, that means this Earth is not the typical one for Batman, Superman, etc.  This is a parallel universe where the usual rules and norms we are familier with don't have to apply.  Simply put that means the creaters of this show have a bigger creative license and can do different things; and we as fanboys have no right to bitch, this is another universe.  Kind of like Star Trek where Spock had a goatee in that parallel universe episode...

The series is good, however the DVD releases are aimed at scamming people out of their money.  Typically when a tv show is released you get a whole season.  I just bought Game of Thrones: Season 1, this is the ENTIRE season 1.  These jerks are however pulling the old Season 1: Vol. 1, Vol. 2, etc trick.  All fans of any tv series want, is to buy one box set and be done.  When a season  comes out we want one box, period.  DC, or whoever is in charge of the DVD release doesn't realize this.  Releasing shows in volumes versus seasons actually hurts sale numbers.

People get pissed off and don't buy anything in the end.

If DC entertainment want's $$$, they just need to wait and release a COMPLETE season 1, I believe another Amazon reviewer stated that would consist of 26 episodes.

In closing I recommend you watch Young Justice on Cartoon Network, it's time has changed now to Saturday morning at 8:30-9:30 a.m., I'm not exactly what time...

Definitely wait for a complete season release.  Money comes hard these days and every penny counts.  Complete season releases are the only way to buy series.
