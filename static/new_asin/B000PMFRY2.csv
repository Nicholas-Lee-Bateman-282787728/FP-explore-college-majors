I won,t elaborate on the plot but basically it's the story of a man and a woman who get lost in the woods. I have to admit I had never seen/heard dialogues used it such way. When these two talk together, you can actually see their lips are not moving at all through the whole movie.

Anyways, I recomend this one very much if you're a fan of weird and interesting movies like David Lynch, amongst others.",1204502400,,597,4.265486725663717

Gert, the village streetcleaner and assistant dumpmeister is our simple but dedicated hero. His heroic quest is to deliver lady Plum, princess of the trailer park with bangs starched upwards (Something About Mary?), to her unseen husband-to-be. Plum is a horse-faced beauty of boyish bust, with a father whose jealousy far exceeds anything to be jealous about. Then the quest begins, from trailer to cornfield, through travails (including grafitti), hermit circus escapees, and something like mud-wrestling Rockettes.

The sound track is unique - it came first, followed by the filming, leaving the English-language movie looking as if the English had been badly dubbed. Then, towards the end, it becomes a musical. All filmed in an archaic black and white (extras in color, though).

So, it's somewhere between 1600 in its fairy tale sense and its 1960s styling, but not to be easily identified, or even understood. It's weird and wonderful. Even having seen it, I'm still not sure what I saw - but I like it.
