1622707,1,B00005LMAW,"I did not enjoy this DVD one bit. It did not make any sense, probably because I did not even watch any of the first 3 DVDS. I think all the imagining of undressing and big ... are a mockery to young girls and women, and I do not approve of people watching it. I hope it gets better, but until it does, this is the only installment I will buy of it.",1040342400,,348,3.780821917808219
1622708,4,B00005LMAW,"This is the first part of the television series after the OAV. I think the Theme song for the show [stunk] and should have stayed with the one used previously. I also don't get how little ""Jeffy"" plays a part and why she suddenly has a penpal named Micky she can just tell everything too.
With that out of the way...Magic Users Club is great! The characters are still lovable and Takeo is still picturing indecent things. I enjoy how the show feels real, not everyday is there some huge magical delemia (not as big as aliens anyway) the magic is used kind of to help along a storyline of the characters relationships with eachother. The humor is still great and on the dvd you get flubs of the voice actors wich is both fun and revealing!",1015804800,4,738,4.394160583941606
1622709,5,B00005LMAW,"Now I'm just a Baka Gajinn, but I was able to catch many of the insider cultural references and jokes.
There's the battle for club membership and loyality. There are weird giant aliens.  You have the female head of the Manga club being attacked by tentcles. And there was, well just get the disk. You will be really happy you did.
A friend who was over watching the episode turned to me after the last episode on the disk and demanded more.  She was really unhappy that I didn't have the whole series on hand.",1006041600,4,509,4.347368421052631
1622710,3,B00005LMAW,"When the movie started, I kept stopping it and starting it, trying to figure out why the sound wasn't working. Then I let it play: the sound was fine, it's just that the directors were true to reality: the opening scene features the arrival of the great bell from space and since space is vacume sound doesn't travel (sound being the vibration of air...).
A great Bell arrives from outer space and promptly disables all military attacks on it. Strangely, it does so non-violently. That is, while it destroys military hardware it scans for life forms first and avoids killing people, disintegrating hardware around them. And it only seems to reacts when attacked.
The Magic User's Club is a small group of teenagers who devote themselves to eliminating this ""enemy"". Magic is ""real""; they chant spells and can make objects fly or tranfsorm, for example. There's the nerd boy who's the center of action (he gets to panties and brassier fantasy stages), who is even leched on by an androgynous member of the club. The young girl who's the primary female is a less-than-skilled magic user learning to fly her broom. The setting is modern day: cars, airplanes, and the club wears retro witch outfits when in the club (with a more modern cut - like bee-bop Holloween), but otherwise dress normal outside the club - shorts, tank tops, etc.
The overall theme of this is like most other modern Japanese anime: bright colors, very good animation, risque humor, modern setting, young people, obsession with big boobs in some cases (the teacher especially), rivallry between Magic Users Clubs and a Comic Book Club. It could be termed good clean teenage fun. Not so mature as to label it adult fair, but sexy enough to make it a step above adolescent cartoons.
I rated it an honest 3 because some people rate everything 5 even if they think it's trash. For me, 3 means it's a fairly good, middle-of-the line movie, worth a buy for intense anime fans and worth a rent for normal people. I save 4 and 5s for movies that grabbed me and run off, and which I end up hankering for more of.
This was entertaining, but not super-fabulous.",1004745600,5,2118,4.696236559139785
1622711,5,B00005LMAW,"I got a hold of a pirated fan-subbed copy of the first four episodes from Canada and just about died laughing.  The humor in this anime is subtle at some times and downright hilarious at other times.  Briefly, it's about a girl named Sae whose determination to learn magic leads herself and the other members of her club in a series of comical occurrences.  The supporting cast is super-funny, as well.  I'm waiting with bated breath for the third dvd to come out so I can finally see the conclusion!  Give it a shot, you might love it, I do!",996278400,4,542,4.38

7944031,1,B00005LMAW,"I checked the region code before ordering. This one claims both 1 and 4 region codes. # 1 should play in the USA. This one does not. I tried it on two DVD players and it wouldn't read on either of them. I also tried to play it on my computer and that didn't work either. If you're ordering for play in the U.S.A., don't waste your money. To make matters worse, the shipping took about a month, which was about two weeks longer than the target date.",1395446400,,448,4.1022727272727275
7944032,5,B00005LMAW,"Mahoro is a retired combat android. She has a little over a year left in her operational life span. She decides to spend it helping people. She takes a job as a live in maid for a middle school boy named Suguru. She quickly works her way into his heart with her devotion and pure intentions. They become very close and overcome many challenges. A sexy teacher who has her eye on Suguru is always trying to split them up, an old enemy returns to settle the score with Mahoro, and Mahoro's impending fate weighs heavy on her heart. Despite these trials, their bond remains strong. Thye may be able to overcome any challenge together, but what will happen when her life span comes to an end?

This is a great anime. It is very similar to Steel Angel Kurumi. It also has a bit of a Love Hina, and Girls Bravo mood about it. I personally like it better than Kurumi, and Love Hina. The animation is pretty good, there are lots of great characters. The voice acting, and soundtrack are also very decent. My favorite part about this show is the many different genres it spans. There is action, comedy, drama, and romance. This show has a very sweet love story going on, but there is also a lot of nudity and pervy stuff thrown in there. This show has everything. I can't believe that I just found out about it by accident. It's over 10 years old. I'm very glad I discovered Maharomatic. I think any mature anime fan can find something to love here.",1353196800,,1440,4.373134328358209
7944033,5,B00005LMAW,"they showed the first 4 episodes on ""The Cutting Edge"" from On Demand and never went any further with it.  i always wondered how things turned out then i found the rest of the series here on Amazon.com.  if you like the Comedy/Romantic Anime with loads of ""Fanning"" and Cartoon Nudity then this is for you...",1303516800,,308,4.482142857142857
7944034,3,B00005LMAW,"I don't really know how to rate this... I though both seasons were extremely funny and cute, but the ending is SO DEPRESSING, I just can't recommend the series.  There should be a law against putting an ending like this on what is essentially an ecchi comedy.  I mean, what a DOWNER! I'm going to be depressed for the rest of the month.  Who needs it?  If I want to be depressed I'll watch PBS.",1123459200,,394,4.213333333333333
7944035,4,B00005LMAW,"This season picks up after everyone seems to have gotten over the confrontation from the previous finale.  Everything seems to be getting back to ""Normal"".  Suddenly a small, silent girl with multicolored hair is stalking Suguru.
Introducing Minawa.  Every moment she's on the screen I'm reminded of old Buster Keaton films.  Her somber expression is as solid are a rock no matter what happens.  Add to that her clumsiness and apologetic nature and every moment she's on the screen is an invitation to laugh and feel sorry for her at the same time.  She is a tragic comedy all in one.
As far as the story is concearned, nothing really happens here that doesn't involve Minawa.  If it isn't enough to deal with a secret army called Vesper involved in a hidden war, now we have to deal with a secret society called Management.  Minawa is somewhat a creation of this society as their scientits take sick pleasure in tampering with nature.
Beyond that, it's mostly episodal comedy from here on out.  Mahoro does a good job of disguising herself badly.  Minawa seems to trip over everything, even nothing at all.  The perverted teacher is still perverted.  And all but two girls in the main cast wage war with their... ahem.... insecurities.
Most of the episodes on this disk are just for fun.  Technically, The Opening / Ending themes are not as enjoyable as the first season.  I'm still waiting for the story to develop. But, the series has improved a bit.  The humor is less sex oriented (which isn't saying much) and the introduction of Minawa and Management give this season a story without re-hashing the conflicts of the first.
Again, Mahoromatic proves to be a fun series with a little bitter aftertaste.  With all that's going on with everybody, one could almost not notice the countdown timer.",1087776000,,1798,4.770226537216828
7944036,1,B00005LMAW,"This is one of the worst anime I have ever seen. It was so boring and stupid and made no sense at all. I guess it would have helped if I had bought the previous three volumes.
The voice acting was ok, although I only listened to the English. The opening theme song was horrible and I didn't like the excessive fan service. It was kind of annoying.
I hope I don't run across another mindless anime like Magic User's Club EVER again.",1087430400,,431,4.204819277108434
7944037,5,B00005LMAW,"mahoromatic is a great series if you like dramam and comedy, you sdhould go for it but the bad part is a lottttttt of fanservice and breast shots so beware if you're not at least 13. but it has a good plot and a nice ending; and all in all mahoromatic is very nice. and it has awesome animation too its a sweet plot and suguru is very funny haha and remember...

7944038,5,B00005LMAW,"Season 1 in all of their existance, but somehow they did. The majority of this DVD is ""comedic awesomeness."" Yes, this DVD has little to do with the majority of the plot, but there is always little things you need to know, and everyone needs a good laugh now and then. This Season will, quite litterally, make you laugh until you can't breathe.
The Mahoromatic artists have, once again, shown their true skill without flaw. The music is, dare I say, better than the 1st season, so the soundtrack is definately a necessity! The only flaw to this DVD is Pioneer doesn't give you anything for your paper dolls. Sigh!
Oh, and I don't want to spoil anything for anyone, but ""Dirty thoughts are bad!""",1063152000,,694,4.56
