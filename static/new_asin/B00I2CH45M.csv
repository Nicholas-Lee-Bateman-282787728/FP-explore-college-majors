The only suggestion I would have and warn others to change the page after 4 classes you need to find an arrow on the side, which is almost the same color as the wall and press it, no keyboard only that arrow. Also it has no ""play all"". SO you have to press each class for your little one (I use it for 3 years old).

But over all it is a perfect set for words!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1395705600,2,420,4.0
