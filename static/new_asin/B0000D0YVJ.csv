7999788,5,B0000D0YVJ,"good movie, one of those that you catch in the middle and really get into, and like...but missed the title, making it a hard to find dvd.  Prompt delivery.",1360368000,,155,4.344827586206897
7999789,3,B0000D0YVJ,"I only bought this movie to see Peter Facinelli, and it ended up being ok. Actually, it was on pace pretty well and I was interested for sure as it has a very compelling premise, but the ending was very cliche and anticlimactic. The acting was all around good, but I probably wouldn't recommend Stealing Time to anyone.",1243814400,,319,4.517241379310345
7999790,5,B0000D0YVJ,"In a time of sucky films, I give Stealing Time and its filmmakers kudos for keeping me engaged and making me care about these four young characters who, despite their Hollywood good-looks, did a fantastic job on screen with seemingly poinant direction. The photography was that of a big studio movie. And great ending!! Why didn't we hear about this film?!!! Put it in your queue.",1146096000,,380,4.7727272727272725
7999791,1,B0000D0YVJ,"""Stealing Time"" actually dates back to 2001 when it was mysteriously titled ""Rennie's Landing"". Which explains how director Marc Fusco was able to afford this cast of now established television/movie actors in what is obviously an extremely low budget production. About ten minutes into the film you understand why this thing never got a theatrical release after it made the film festival rounds several years ago.

Its recent distribution by Franchise Pictures probably reflects a perception that the rising popularity of certain cast members can be milked to recover some of the modest production costs. Although not a great addition to anyone's resume, young actors have done worse things when they were desperately seeking acting work of any kind.

Peter Facinelli, Ethan Embry, Scott Foley and Charlotte Ayanna play college friends who do an early ""Big Chill"" reunion and compare war stories about the failure of reality to measure up to their dreams.

Unfortunately nothing else happens, absolutely nothing. Yes Alec (Facinelli) dreams about a liquor store holdup and a bank robbery, which are then ""cheaply and lamely"" staged to completely inappropriate music. It is the least suspenseful bank job since W.C. Fields was the guard in ""The Bank Dick"".

If anyone can point to any moment in ""Stealing Time"" where something ""actually"" happens I would like to know about it, because as far as I can tell, not a thing happens in the whole film. Perhaps Fusco, through incessant visual reflections, is trying to say something profound about taking control of one's life before it is too late. Like ""St. Elmo's Fire"" the movie is littered with every profound thought ever uttered by a young adult who has left the ivory tower to experience the real world for the first time.

I felt Fusco was going for a kind of Howard Hawks Young Professionals in Action ""Only Angels Have Wings"" motif. Then again, I'm sure I was reading much too much into the film. After all, things actually happen Howard Hawks films.

Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.",1139270400,6,2051,4.965014577259475
7999792,1,B0000D0YVJ,I still have not received this item after 1 month and a half is this normal? All the other dvds I have ordered came within a week of 2,1121472000,,134,3.6551724137931036
7999793,3,B0000D0YVJ,"Movies that play with your mind and immerse you in a complex plot are fine with me; however, when the movie ends and you wonder what the filmmakers were trying to do, then that's a different story.  STEALING TIME features some fine performances from its attractive cast:  Peter Facinelli (Who has to be Tom Cruise's secret brother) plays Alec, a rather self-absorbed and cynical producer wannabe who discovers he has an inoperable brain tumor and is going to die; Scott Foley (Scream 3, Felicity) is the all around nice guy Casey, who we discover had a secret life with a young lady (Jennifer Garner in a real quick appearance); Ethan Embry as the wannabe actor Trevor; and Charlotte Ayanna (Training Day) as the wannabe do gooder Sam.  The movie starts out slowly and it's hard to stay interested until the interesting premise of robbing a bank enters the picture.  Where the movie goes wrong is in its manipulating of time to confuse its audience as to what is and what isn't happening.  It's metaphysical resolution is where we are robbed of what could have been a satisfying film experience, but in spite of the performances, the conclusion is so unacceptable, I found it hard to give it the three stars, which are mainly for the cast.",1112832000,5,1239,4.717592592592593
7999794,2,B0000D0YVJ,"Photogenic cast meandering through a time-worn plot.  It looks like something thrown together in between auditions for real films.  I wish I could be as enthusiastic as the previous reviewer but the best I can say for this is that if you happen to come across it on cable while you're sick in bed, then watch it.  However, DO NOT go out of your way for it -- there are thousands of films more worthwhile than this one.",1105920000,5,418,4.333333333333333
7999795,4,B0000D0YVJ,"STEALING TIME (2003) starring Peter Facinelli, Scott Foley, Ethan Embry, Charlotte Ayanna, and Jennifer Garner.
I found STEALING TIME to be an engaging film that has a little bit of drama, a little bit of action, and a little bit of comedy. It's also a little bit of a cross between WISDOM with Emilio Estevez and Demi Moore(although much better)and the Tom Cruise classic RISKY BUSINESS. Check it out and I believe you'll see what I mean. Peter Facinelli (CANT HARDLY WAIT, tv's FASTLANE), the film's lead, has always seemed a little Tom Cruise-ish to me anyway. The film has good performances by Facinelli, Scott Foley (BELOW), Ethan Embry (TIMELINE), Charlotte Ayanna (LOVE THE HARD WAY), and even Jennifer Garner (DAREDEVIL) in a small role. I must say, STEALING TIME is the first movie involving a bank robbery I've seen in a long time where I was actually rooting for the characters and wanting them to pull it off without harm. A good character driven film with heart. It's really to bad this film didn't get more attention paid to it as it is highly entertaining and probably would have made bigger stars out of everyone involved. Give it a look.",1071273600,,1154,4.746268656716418
