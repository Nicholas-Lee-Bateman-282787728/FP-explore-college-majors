534878,5,6302993199,"This is not my favorite Bresson film, but it is one of them.  Here Bresson shows every imaginable form of corruption and betrayal in order to display the tainting of innocence.
While I don't remember all the details (and there are many of them), the jist of the film has stayed with me.  A level headed, blue collar man stops to get change from a store. He is working, driving his truck, doing nothing wrong.  Unfortunately, he is simply in the wrong place at the wrong time.  He receives bills from the shop which are counterfeit.  Two young men, pressed for cash, had been in earlier and managed to pass the fake bills off as real ones.  The point of this scene is that there is no point; this commonplace man does something that all of us have done a million times, and not only is his life destroyed as a result, he plays a significant part in that subsequent destruction.  The film could be seen either as a tragic series of events with no sense behind them (again, Bresson puts the stress on meaninglessness) or as the potential criminal hiding within us all.
Sitting at a restaurant, the man pays for a meal with the false money he has been given.  The waiter calls him a thief, and the man naturally takes offense, shoving the waiter into a table.  These scenes, in which the spirit of revolt overcomes the man's rationality, are shot in still (as on the cover of the video itself), and are intended to represent the pride of innocence when encountered with injustice.
From there, everything goes seriously downhill.  In an ironic, terrible twist, the man ends up in prison with one of the young hoodlums who help put him there.  Having lost his family, his job, his reputation and his freedom, a silent fury (which we do not see until the end) builds in the man until he becomes a complete outsider, committing an unspeakable act at the end and confessing to it.
The extraordinary aspect of this piece by Bresson is that one cannot help but be haunted by the very viable and real possibility of these events.  The only unbelievable part is the man's willingness to snap to such a degree.  The irretrievability of the man's innocence, his life, and his ultimate fate is even more agonizing: nothing he could do would return him to his ordinary life.  Watching this film is like watching a lamb go to the slaughter, resurrect itself and slaughter everyone else.",1089590400,4,2368,4.567375886524823
534879,5,6302993199,"L'Argent is a subtle film about class warfare.  The story is deceptively simple -- it follows the journey of a counterfeit note as it changes hands-- but the examination of social attitudes and hypocrisies is quite thorough.
The forgers are two rich kids, they pass the note on to two middle class shopkeepers, and the shopkeepers pass it on to a working class truck driver. The corruption begins at the top of the economic food chain but the rich never pay for their crimes and so they commit them without even a second thought. The middle class is not as well off and so they are even more moneygrubbing than the untouchable and insulated wealthy  and knowingly pass the counterfeit note on to an unsuspecting working class truck driver and then later lie about it in court. Its the working classes that pay for everyones crimes. Bresson is brilliant at keeping things simple. Many of his films are based on short literary works and so his films have an economy to them that is almost breathtaking. In the case of L'Argent Bresson takes a Tolstoy story and pares it down to the basics-- for Bresson the story is about the class struggle and how this system with its built-in hypocrisies and injustices dehumanizes and corrupts us all. The rich are seen to be callous and arrogant  because untouchable, the middle class are seen to be petty and selfish, and the working class is seen to be easily victimized--merely fodder for those who happen to be higher on the economic bracket. Bresson does not fool around with character development or atmosphere, he stays focused on the essentails and thus the distilled quality of his films. In his early films he focused on alienated psychologies(Pickpocket, Diary of A Country Priest) but in his later films (Lancelot of the Lake, L'Argent) he focuses on society, and individuals are seen merely to represent types. The early films are more satisfying and richer and also more life affirming whereas the later ones leave you cold. What is consistent in all of his films is the utter perfectionism he displays with each shot. Bresson made such a small number of films because he took on average three years to make each one. Still he is not a film maker who will ever reach a large audience because his vision is so bleak. He does remain a favorite of true cinema fans and film makers; Jean-Luc Godard and Louis Malle are among his fans. Some people try and find affirmative messages in his films but only Pickpocket ends on a hopeful note. What sets his films apart is the sense that Bresson is devoted to finding the perfect visual style to convey his content. No other film maker does that better than Bresson.",1068768000,12,2656,4.695278969957082
534880,5,6302993199,"It's amazing so few people know of Bresson's films; he's one of the greatest filmmakers of all time. This film, his last, is brutally efficient in laying out his often bleak view of the world. Based on a Tolstoy story 'Le Faux Billet', it's an exercise in zero sum eliminative logic. The fact that the culprit (a conterfeit bill) is set in motion by playfully malicious youths and then the path is cleared by the greed and malice of their hypocritical parents is a beautiful setup for this dark meditation on the subjugation of human beings to their ruthless god.
The abstract mechnanized backdrop for the titles sequence is a money machine. As is so often the case, behind the deadpan performances of his nonactors (many of whom are superb in this movie), Bresson fetishizes on his subject unto hypnosis; in this film, notice how many times doors, small and large, are slamming, beginning with the automated one closing the first transaction, to the last image of a row of people gawking at the door. This film retains its searing impact through many viewings.",1026604800,21,1061,4.771739130434782
534881,4,6302993199,"Mistaking the trees for the wood, I forgot to mention the most important aspect of Bresson's last masterpiece, 'L'Argent': one of the greatest shots in all cinema.  In the immediate aftermath of a domestic murder, blood flecked on dully garish wallpaper is briefly illumined by a fallen lampshade before it's extinguished.  Shattering.",1007683200,3,335,5.423076923076923
534882,5,6302993199,"This was, as it turned out, Robert Bresson's final film - he died last year, having spent the better part of the century making only fourteen feature films, most of which are truly remarkable.  Fairly loosely adapted  from a Tolstoy story, it starts off with a middle-class kid passing a  forged banknote and ends in axe-murder.  Bresson displays commendable  artistic nous in avoiding the preachier, more moralistic bits of the  original story (it's not one of Tolstoy's better tales) and concentrates  instead on the man-made but nevertheless impersonal forces that conspire to  drag the oilman Yvon from decent family man to murderer.  (The murder  itself is one of the most stunning, and yet most discreet sequences in the  history of film.)
Bresson's usual crawling pace is sped up here, as  there are so many stories and sub-plots to get through.  Kent Jones, in his  excellent study of the film, has observed that while Bresson has a  wonderfully acute sense of what young people are like, he falls down a bit  when he tries to depict the Paris underworld; but it doesn't matter, as  this is a film with its eyes on bigger matters than documentary realism.
Bresson was at least 80 when he made L'Argent, and his uncanny sense of  rhythm and timing were not at all dulled; the fairly gentle pace of the  opening scenes accelerates into hyperspace before the end.  L'Argent is  about as far from the conventional crime picture is you'll ever get; the  opening shot, of the metal screen of an ATM machine sliding shut,  establishes the sense of inexorability.  There are no Good But Troubled  Cops, no Criminal Masterminds.  Everybody in the film is humanly  inexplicable, inexplicably human.  When Yvon, at the film's visceral  climax, asks the question ""Where's the money?"", it was Bresson  himself who, in an interview, gave the answer: Everywhere.  If only most  directors' final films were as good as this.",963532800,14,1915,4.905956112852665
534924,5,6302993199,"L'Argent is one of the little known silent masterpieces that have been rediscovered in recent years. The film is distinguished for many reasons. The acting is magnificent led by Pierre Alcover and Birgitte Helm (of Metropolis fame). The costuming and staging are fantastic, in fact the film makers made use of the Paris Bourse for several scenes. Most wonderful is the camera work, which although adanced for the day, even experimental, is completely natural to the story. L'Argent was at the time the most expensive French film to date, designed to compete with both Hollywood and UFA of Germany. David Shepard has written enthusiatically of the French edition of the DVD. A must buy for film buffs and silent film buffs of all kinds",1256601600,2,734,4.92741935483871
534925,4,6302993199,"Last film by acclaimed French director Robert Bresson. In color. 1hour and 20 minutes.

This film is very different, at first glance, from other Bresson classics. The pace is very fast (specially the first half), the streets of Paris in all its rush and chaos. The insides of homes and shops are remnants of peace and soberness (only apparently), trying to protect from the ""evil"" outside. The characters are practically all young people, lost souls, and for a reason: ""they lack the inner resources necessary to make the kind of leap that 'Pickpocket's Michel or 'A Man Escaped's Fontaine makes. They lack sufficient experience to understand that one can have faith in something other than such paltry, man-made creations as ""progress"" and money.""

Those were the words of essayist Kent Jones in the case insert.

The second half of the film moves to a more rural setting. The pace slows down. We meet a very noteworthy character. A woman with faith, lots of faith. In one scene they share a few moments of peace and give the film more meaning than I can try to explain with my limited English vocabulary. But it's the climax, and then comes the tragedy, which is like the final statement of the author, Bresson.

I didn't like the film as much as ""Diary of a country priest"", and way less than ""Au Hazard Balthasar"", maybe because of its pessimistic taste, the lack of hope. Probably I don't like it that much because, simply put, modernity is ugly. And postmodernity is infinitely more so.

But faith, hope and love are never in vain for those who love God, and belief in the resurrection of His Son Jesus.",1160524800,,1609,4.691489361702128
534926,5,6302993199,"This is Bresson's greatest, and last, work.  It is a work from a true cinematic auteur.  No one made films like Bresson did, and I don't think anyone ever will.  This film is based on a short story by Tolstoy entitled The Forged Coupon (aka The Forged Note), except Tolstoy's story is much different that Bresson's take here.  It is about how a forged note of 500 francs passes from one hand to another, ruining the life of a fuel oil delivery man.  Bresson made this film when he was 82, but you couldn't tell that it was made by a man that old.  Quite often, critics assume that filmmakers (and artists in general) have nothing to say as they get older.  On the contrary.  They have even more to say.  A real artist's vision deepens as they grow older.  Kurosawa made Ran at 75, and Eastwood made Million Dollar Baby at 74.  Those are their best films.  Bresson is rather feisty and combative (which is a good thing) in the interviews presented here.  He doesn't mince words, and he doesn't seem interested in doing the usual inane questions that featurettes on DVD's usually have from bubble headed reporters (even though these were shot for French TV, not Entertainment Tonight).  He has something to say.  This is my favorite film of his (even though Lancelot of the Lake and Au Hasard Balthazar are close behind).  Sadly, he never made another one after this, but the 13 he did make are all brilliant.  Not one bad one.  Great film, great man...",1146873600,15,1451,4.515384615384615
534927,4,6302993199,"I recently purchased L'Argent having read a few positive things about the movie.  It is the story of greed run amuck.  One spoiled brat passes a conferfeit French equivilent of a $100 bill and the misfortune that ensues affects many innocent people.  The movie does an outstanding job of portraying the people involved and that has the effect of drawing both towards and away from the various characters.  Some we will perceive as innocent and some as guilty as I think director Robert Bresson intended.  This lesson in morality works well until Bresson takes a leap too far in making his point.  Before we reach that extreme, however, we are convincingly reminded that innocence is not always rewared nor is guilt always punished.  Bresson goes beyond that to such lessons as the poor being always at a disadvantage in court when challenging the rich and that love often doesn't conquer much of anything.  Various characters end up in jail while other lose in other ways.

In regards to the end, I will give nothing away (I hope) but I feel the need to complain about the excessive conclusion that Bresson seems to want us to end up with.  An innocent victim suffers one setback after another and he has our sympathy.  However, what gets passed along from his hands to others is in no way a logical next step as the director would have us believe.  Maybe others might think so.  However, for me this leap of logic ruined the film's message.  To paraphrase Cornelius Ryan, this was a misfortune too far.",1137456000,10,1503,4.687022900763359
534928,3,6302993199,"Bresson has made some unparallelled films over a great part of the twentieth century. 'Balthasar' and 'Diary of A Country Priest', are right up there with my all time favourites. Friends try to convince me that 'Lancelot'(his excurison into colour) and,'L'Argent' are classics too. I can't agree. The narrative here is quite simple and the morality, so stripped back that it it feels like a Sunday School lesson. Even in 'Lancelot', where the acting was bereft of emoting, there was some degree of intimacy, that facilitated connections for me. Here, the characters are rendered as automatons, which is clearly part of Bresson's intention, but makes for some unreal, de-animated cause and effect. Interersting tale, artful photography, a bleak and discomforting fable. I wouldn't race out to catch this one, nor judge his contributions to cinema on the strength of it. He is undoubtedly in the Bunuel,Bergman, Dreyer, Tarkovsky,Kurosowa league.",1130889600,6,944,5.342281879194631
534929,5,6302993199,"L'argent is not only the last film of Robert Bresson, it is also one of his greatest achievements. Especially when compared to some of his efforts of the 70's (like 'Lancelot of the Lake) this film shows a return to the genius that one associates with the director of 'Diary of a Country Priest', 'a man escaped', 'Au Hazard Balthazar', etc. The film brilliantly illustrates how one negative event leads to a succession of other events, gradually leading to the greatest of human folly. This pescimistic look at human nature, while it turns some people off, shows a realistic and yet stylized view of life - it is the cycle of Karma (one could say). Bresson emphasizes the smallest details in his films - and turns us on to the very essence of experience.",1129852800,2,755,4.641791044776119

534931,5,6302993199,"French director Bresson spins this frighteningly credible yarn with economy of language and motion, contrasting ignorance and carelessness of the cosseted rich with the marginal existences of the working poor, illustrating how a single misfortune can sever an already tenuous ability to survive.  Smart, sobering and vivid.",1124755200,5,323,5.872340425531915
534932,5,6302993199,"Bresson captures the truth through his silence of human emotions where the sensations triggered by futile motifs such as smiles, frowns, and other expressions of feelings are repressed.  In the light of Jean-Luc Godard many could probably argue that there is still a lie present in Bresson's films, as Godard once stated, ""Every edit is a lie"".  Nonetheless, the intentions of Bresson are sincere, as the actions on the screen are what he wanted the audience to observe, not the acted part, the extravagantly flamboyant expression of feelings that could cloud the viewer's perspective of the truth.  All of the emotional aspects could be characteristics of an actor acting where the act itself becomes an intricate lie that tries to convince the audience to react through words disguised in emotions.  Instead of showing the deceitfulness of expressive sentiments and reactions of the body and face Bresson strips down all scenes of emotions to only leave the audience with what truly counts - actions.

Those who never had the pleasure to be initiated in Bresson's stylistic cinema, might find it awkward and obtuse.  Yet, if reflection were to be provided a different perspective might arise, which could deepen the observers notions of what they would see in cinema and in life.  Many of the critics considered Bresson an old spirit from old days of cinema when he released L'Argent while they ought to have considered him as a cinematic innovator that did not conform to traditional narratives.  Despite his unconstructive critics, who actually helped him secure his place in time among the cinematic scholars, his final film provides an intriguing tale of guilt in L'Argent.  He based L'Argent on a personal adaptation of Tolstoy's The Forged Coupon, which deals with the fate of forgery.

Innocently, the teen Norbert asks for his monthly allowance while also trying to ask for a little more, but the father refuses to provide the extra money for his son.  It is in this opening where the consequences of a horrific crime are about to take form, Norbert asks his friend Martial for financial backing.  Martial has a forged 500 Francs bill, which they pass off in a small camera store where they buy a cheap frame.  The owner of the store realizes later on that they have received a forged bill, and he also received two more at an earlier occasion.  Instead of contacting the police the storeowner decides to pass the bills to someone else, and this unfortunate person happens to be Yvon Targe who gets paid with the forged bills for providing house oil.  In the scenes where the money switches hands the camera dutifully studies the hand movements and the simplicity social destruction can be spread.

Yvon is charged for trying to use the forged bills, and he brings the police to the camera store where he receievd the forged bills.  The storeowner informs the police that he has never seen him before and his assistant Lucien supports his testimony.  This unfortunate event causes Yvon to loose his job, which leads him into a desperate situation where he tries to raise money quickly to save his family form further financial misery.  However, the situation backfires when he first does not share with his wife what he is about to do, and second, he gets arrested and sentenced to jail for being an accomplice to a bank robbery.  Parallel to Yvon's story the audience gets to follow a true criminal, Lucien, the camera store assistant, who is fired and later robs his former employer.  Lucien accumulates a large sum of money through several illegal activities.  Through the illusion of wealth his arrogance grows, and his ignorance of consequence leads him to become a Robin Hood character who donates to the poor including his former boss.  This is a mistake that eventually sends him to prison where he meets Yvon.

The jail sentence becomes the beginning of a long downward spiraling journey for Yvon.  When Lucien arrives to the jail they have a brief, but essential conversation at a Catholic mass.  The irony that Bresson applies in this sequence is profound while Lucien declares to Yvon, ""Neither of us is a killer. We alone have no one on our conscience.""  To this Yvon responds, ""You have me on your conscience. You have to answer for that now.""  In the following scene Yvon wakes up to the alarm of Lucien's escape attempt.  His cellmate comforts him and says that they will never have to see him again, as Lucien would be transferred to high security prison. ""I will."", replies Yvon to his cellmate's effort to comfort him.  Soon after Lucien's escape attempt Yvon finds himself a free man, but instead of a peaceful lifestyle he retorts with violent crimes.

The crimes that Yvon commits seem to be thoughtless acts of violence.  However, recalling the scene where he talked with Lucien presents the situation in a different light, even if it seems disturbing and callous.  The open ended conclusion of the story leaves the audience with a cliff hanger where several thoughts might run through the mind.  Initially, it might seem dark and gloomy, but it also leaves the audience with several options to consider that can steer the story in many possible directions.  The ending also leaves the viewers with a number of ideas to ponder.  One of these notions could possibly be the truth about absolute guilt.  It also questions whether innocence of an act and pure ignorance could be a crime.  These and many other issues are left for the audience to ponder and muse over while L'Argent slowly settles with an enigmatic vision of the truth.",1119484800,7,5564,4.861081654294804
534933,3,6302993199,"L'Argent is commonly hailed as Bresson's parting masterpiece, but sadly it's seriously undermined by atrocious performances and a completely unconvincing last reel. Which is a shame, because there's much to admire here. His adaptation of a Tolstoy short story about the disastrous consequences for the innocent recipient of a forged banknote has for the most part a terrific sense of narrative, exposing the way petty crime can have major moral repercussions throughout the social scale, with the rich able to buy or lie their way out of trouble. But oh, those performances! Bresson made a career out of soliciting convincing performances out of amateurs, so you have to wonder just why they are nearly all so very terrible here. Not only can they not act or give even the vaguest impression of life, intelligent or otherwise, but they move so mechanically - mannequin-like with back straight and arms down their sides like lead weights as they try to remember to hit their marks - that you wonder if Bresson actually intended the effect. Whether he did or not, it's like watching outtakes from a public information film at times, or the Swedish phrase book sketch from Monty Python. A couple of performers get by, but Christian Patey is so physically and verbally awkward in the lead that it's painful watching his progress, but in all the Wong ways.

Yet for 70 minutes at least the strength of the narrative and Bresson's spare, economical telling lend it a relentless forward momentum, manage to hold you. Tragically, the film's resolution fails to convince in any way, turning its initially fundamentally decent protagonist into a money-hungry thrill-killer not as a logical consequence of his experiences but purely as a plot contrivance to prove a point and provide an ending. The final (offscreen) mass murder simply seems tacked-on sensationalism, especially considering the absurd set of circumstances that places him in the bosom of the family he kills.

A good film but ultimately a frustrating and unrewarding one for all its strong points.",1119052800,,2053,5.071005917159764

7834510,5,6302993199,"Robert Bresson's ""L'Argent"" (1983) is a masterly adaptation of the Leo Tolstoy novella ""The False Coupon"" about the devastation that the worship of the false (and evil) god of money can wreak upon the human soul.  Set in contemporary Paris and in a country village (for the film's third and final act), this final film by the great French filmmaker is a stunner - an inspired work of art completely unafraid to go to some very dark places and to challenge the viewer.  Bresson consistently held the notion of film as entertainment in utter contempt, instead focusing like a laser on stories that explore intriguing and most often perplexing and troubling ideas related to the human condition.

Despite the undeniable artistry of Bresson's advanced auteurism in bringing this Tolstoy adaptation to the screen, I couldn't entirely escape the feeling that I was watching a partial mash-up of Hitchcock's ""The Wrong Man"" and Richard Brooks's ""In Cold Blood.""  Bresson's non-professional (first-time) lead actor seems out of his depth and as stiff as a board, projecting next to nothing (Bresson used the term ""models"" for his actors, and it's particularly apt in this case), making me long for the sublimely convincing lead acting performances found in those two  American films of the '50s and '60s.

The newly restored 4K digitally transferred print (presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.66:1) is excellent (I have the DVD), as is the Dolby processed monaural sound (this is all par for the course for Criterion).  Lighting, color, composition and sound are meticulously executed in this film, so all the impeccable restorative work that was done for this new release is to be appreciated.  The only piece of music used in the film - and it appears organically (the only way Bresson believed in including music) - is J.S. Bach's ""Chromatic Fantasia.""  Concerning the English subtitles, I know enough idiomatic French to be able to confirm that they are spot on.

The included extras are definitely of value:
- a half-hour press conference following the showing of ""L'Argent"" at Cannes.  The 81-year-old Bresson is as uncompromising with his answers as he is with his cinematic storytelling, refusing to deal with a succession of clueless, inarticulate questions and nearly ending the Q and A early out of boredom.  Fortunately one older gentleman, clearly familiar with Bresson's oeuvre (a rarity with this crowd) and intrigued by the film he had just seen, sparked his interest with a knowledgeable and probing question that required a detailed explication by the filmmaker, which was something he enjoyed and was capable of doing with great articulateness.

- a 50-minute ""video essay"" by film scholar James Quandt that follows an alphabetical gimmick but still manages to deliver a goodly amount of information and insight into Bresson's work, focusing particularly on this final film.  (Incidentally, ""X"" is for ""ax."")

- a 30-second trailer that is really worth seeing: an exhilarating and brilliant sped-up ATM montage sequence - shot at different ATMs all over Paris - that Bresson (although he was very proud of it) ultimately removed from the film, as he deemed it too out of place stylistically.

- a deluxe 40-page booklet that includes full film credits, a 12-page essay by film critic/author Adrian Martin, and a 24-page interview with Bresson from later in the year of ""L'Argent""'s release.",1501027200,2,3409,5.10431654676259
7834511,5,6302993199,"Robert Bresson's 1983 Tolstoy adaptation L'Argent (Money) is the director's magnificent final film - a masterpiece to set beside his very best work of the 50s and 60s. It won a prize at Cannes together with Andrei Tarkovsky's Nostalghia and marks a wonderful return to form following the gray misanthropy of The Devil, Probably (1977). L'Argent is no less misanthropic, but the adaptation of Tolstoy's wonderful short story `The Forged Coupon' (conceived in 1902) is so skillful that our breath is literally taken away by the depth, the intellectual profundity and the lucid depiction of how money is at the base of all evil and how it has become a false God in the modern world.

Put basically, Bresson's concern was always with the basic metaphysics underpinning the human condition - the reasons we live, the factors that propel human life from birth to death and beyond. As I have outlined in my other Bresson reviews his aesthetic is informed by Catholicism, in his case the peculiar French strain of predestinarian Jansenism. In a Bresson film protagonists function in any given narrative to fulfill whatever has been predestined for them to fulfill. They have no free will of their own and usually the film charts a journey which becomes in effect an unknowing search for spiritual redemption, for grace. Conventional character psychology has no place in a Bresson work - it doesn't matter what happens between life and death, the result will be the same - such is the nature of predestination. Throughout the protagonists will be `acted on' from on high as they are guided towards their fate.

In all Bresson's films up until Mouchette (1967), grace is always found. The protagonists may suffer greatly, but through good means or foul they always achieve a state of redemption. In all his color films from Une femme douce (1969) onwards however, though the characters are acted on from on high and are still fulfilling their already decided destiny, grace is withdrawn and the protagonists plunge into a kind of nihilistic abyss. It is as if Bresson withdraws any hope he ever had for the improvement of mankind as he demonstrates with a ruthless intellectual rigor how man has created his own fall.

Both Lancelot du Lac (1974) and The Devil, Probably embody this completely, the first to great effect through the use of myth and the second with less success as a one-dimensional misanthropic harangue. L'Argent takes us back to the crime and punishment of Pickpocket (1959) and a simple comparison between the two illustrates the shift towards negativity in Bresson's worldview. Pickpocket's main character Michel goes to prison to gain his redemption as granted by Jeanne in the film's final confessional sequence. Redemption also awaits Yvon Targe (the main character of L'Argent) who loses everything, axes a whole family to death in the name of spiritual release and gives himself over to imprisonment and possible capital punishment. Except there is one important difference namely in the nature of the `God' they give themselves up to. In Pickpocket, God is clearly a spiritual presence. Jeanne is the name of the patron saint of the French Catholic Church and it's clear that Michel is given a chance to wipe his slate clean and start his life afresh as a good God-fearing Catholic - therein lies his grace. In L'Argent, money is posited as the new `God made visable' (as one character calls it) and it's clear that for Bresson the modern world is one where the material existence of God has overtaken His spiritual existence. Man exists at the end of the 20th century only to create capital and that is what lies at the bottom of the rotten nature of society which clearly Bresson is disenchanted with. L'Argent systematically demonstrates how the new God of money establishes a garden where the 7 deadly sins (of lust, gluttony, sloth, wrath, envy and pride) flourish at the expense of the 7 Catholic virtues (of chastity, temperance, charity, diligence, patience, kindness and humility). This is most clearly shown by all the characters lying to each other out of everyday neccessity - son to mother, mother to father, employee to employer, sworn in court witness to sworn in jury, and so on right the way through to the film's final violent epiphany. Small wonder then that grace disappears from the equasion and Targe's 'redemption' proves to be heavily ironic.

The removal of grace from Bresson's worldview can also be seen very clearly by comparing the Tolstoy story with the film. I strongly recommend viewers read the book for themselves (it can be downloaded free at Project Guttenberg and read within a couple of hours). The point of departure for both Tolstoy and Bresson is exactly the same. They seek to depict the old adage that money is the root of all evil. They both start off with a scene where a boy demands an advance on his allowance from his father. The father refuses, and the boy visits a friend who shows him a forged coupon (in the film, a bank note) which they cash in at a photo supply shop where they buy a cheap frame. The owner of the shop is angry that his wife has accepted the forged note and then proceeds to pass it (and two other forged notes that have come his way) on to the serviceman delivering energy (in the book firewood, in the film gas). The serviceman is later caught in a restaurant, charged with passing on counterfeit money and sent to trial. In both book and film the photo shop assistant perjures himself in court by refusing to admit he recognizes the serviceman.

From this point the book and the film diverge. Where the film has the serviceman become a driver for a bank robbery and shows him going to prison, the book has the serviceman become a horse thief who is eventually killed by another man. It is this second man who is sent to prison. The character of Yvon Targe in the film is therefore a composite of these two characters. The book introduces a number of other characters connected in the chain reaction the passing on of the forged coupon causes, but Bresson chooses to delete most of them. In the book we are introduced to an old woman, a Christian who influences a lame tailor. Bresson excises all Christian faith from his old woman who is shown as simply a poor old soul carrying the burden of her family. The axing of the family (following the killing of the innkeeper and his wife) are equally shocking in both book and film, but where Bresson simply finishes the film with the man giving himself up to the police, the book goes on to depict how the man reflects deeply on the old woman's words to him (which Bresson cuts): ""Oh, what a great sin! How can you! Have mercy on yourself. To destroy somebody's soul...and worse, your own!"" These words reverberate around his mind forcing him to confess his crimes to the police. He remains wracked with guilt until he is healed in prison by the Christian teachings of the very same lame tailor who the old woman had so impressed. Most important is the long quote from the Bible (Matthew 25:31) concerning the Sermon of the Mount and then the relating of Christ crucified on Calvary between two thieves. The murderer swallows the lessons about sharing brotherly love and that even a bad man like himself can go to paradise if he mends his ways. Tolstoy then goes on to have him become a kind of holy man who inspires and `cures' the characters introduced earlier in the book - the photo supply shop assistant who gives his money to the poor, his old employers who receive a check from him having been bankrupted by the theft (this is retained by Bresson) and finally even the father and the son from the story's beginning who are reunited at the very end just because the son happened to have contact with the 'holy man' because of his job.

Quite clearly the Tolstoy book is an essay (a Biblical sermon even) on the evils of money which can be defeated through the adoption of Christian faith even if it attacks the ""pseudo-piety and hypocrisy of organized religion"" itself. Grace is therefore an irremovable eternal presence in Tolstoy's world. Bresson sees things quite differently. Clearly in L'Argent money has become the new (false) God and modern man's complete devotion to it leads to the destruction of mankind where the attainment of grace simply becomes impossible. The actions of the boys at the beginning leads with inexorable logic to the lying of all the characters in the film, even under oath in a court of law, and to the ruin of an innocent man who goes to prison, loses his family and any hope of social rehabilitation. Crucially Bresson retains the Christian sermon in the prison which he places before the killings, but instead of Targe being led to the light, it simply passes him by without notice. While the priest delivers his sermon in Latin (a language nobody can understand!) the prisoners simply trade goods behind their backs while Targe talks to the ex-shop assistant Lucien. Targe leaves prison demoralized and with nowhere to go. He has faith in one thing only - money. Money is the name of his God and the sole reason why he embarks on a killing spree.

In this film, Targe takes on the attributes of a typical Bressonian protagonist by simply putting one foot in front of the other to fulfill his predestined fate eschewing free will in the process. But where the God watching and overseeing the main characters of A Man Escaped, Pickpocket, Mouchette and even the donkey Balthazar (in Au hasard Balthazar [1966]) ensures they all receive the benefit of light at the end of their journey, the God watching and overseeing the characters of his color films is false and so the end is one of total darkness. In L'Argent Bresson takes Tolstoy's Biblical parable and turns it on its head as if to demonstrate how devoid of spiritual values and how obsessed with materialism the world had become between the publication of the book in 1902 and the making of his film in 1983.

Bresson deploys his usual drab mise-en-scne, amateur actors (termed `models') and carefully framed elliptical shots (courtesy of his regular cameraman Pasqualino De Santis) which point downwards showing the barest details necessary for us to get the point in each scene. The action moves along with astonishing swiftness focusing ruthlessly on theme rather than character. As with all of Bresson's films we have the uncomfortable feeling of looking at the characters' inner being or `soul' rather than regarding them as characters in a film. L'Argent therefore provokes us into asking ourselves awkward questions about our own lives and the society which surrounds us. Targe undergoes the transformation from innocent man to axe murderer in 82 minutes in the smoothest manner possible. Are our spiritual values or materialistic desires any different from his? If we lost our family, our livelihood, our very claim on existence, mightn't we also be led down a similar path? L'Argent is a deeply disquieting essay on the state of the human condition today and represents Robert Bresson at his most brilliantly incisive. It is essential viewing.

Artificial Eye's DVD presentation here is very good. The pictures (aspect ratio 16:9 - 1.66:1) are clear with the colors well saturated while the Dolby Digital 2.0 sound is as true as you could wish for. The disc comes with two short but interesting interviews with Bresson himself and a brief reaction by Marguerite Duras.",1411430400,3,11410,4.805498981670061

The story is moving, ironic, and emotionaly powerful.

I have this version, and the Artifical Eye PAL version, and the AE print is noticibly sharper and cleaner.
If you can play PAL, I recommend the Artificial Eye print.

There is talk that Criterion is toying with the idea of releasing a pristine print of L'Argent.

They need to hear from us to determine if there will be a market for this film.
I have already sent them an email, to request the release of this film, and the more people they hear
from the better.
Just go to the Criterion website and you will find instruction and link for recommending films.

I think Bresson was in his 80's when he made this film, and died in 1999 (same year Kubrick died).
This film is the best example of his cinematic style, and for me, is his most gripping masterpiece which
is even more relivent today then it was when it was made.

I ordered both this and the Artificial Eye version from Amazon. US, and Amazon. UK respectivly.
The service and delivery were excellent, as always.

7834515,1,6302993199,"In his last film, Robert Bresson attempts a psychological study of man in the lowest and most depressed part of his life as the cards fate hands him go terribly wrong. A spiral of events start from a petty crime done by two teenagers whose forged money, exchanged in a store, lands an unsuspecting youth in dire straits.

Bresson paints a black and white universe where a single person is continually being tricked, harmed, and manipulated by a large mass of people whom see money as the sole source of motivation. This young man, named Yvon, is unable to rise from this elementary act of manipulation, and due to loss of his job, falls into crime, and eventually jail. Loss of members of his family and time in solitary confinement make this bumpy ride all the more psychologically abusing which contributes to the young man's eventual downfall.

Bresson paints this film in a world of coldness, bitterness, apathy which does suit the character's infatuation with money quite well; the problem lies in the desire of the film for the audience to feel sorry for the main character. I must respond, for what, and even if there was a sufficient answer to such a question, why? The true arbitrators of the immoral acts that land the main character in prison don't crack a smile, shed a tear, or show any remote sign of emotion through the entire film; however, that could be excusable, being blamed on their sheer interest in money and unconcerned about the method of its gain. However, the sole character, himself, seems to lack the faculties of emotion, with no true recognizable emotion toward his wife-besides placing his hands on her shoulder or back. During her sole visit with her husband in prison, his wife reminds
him that they should not resolve to fighting in such a condition as they never have quarreled before. This is not such a difficult concept considering that these people don't exist-not because they are in a film-but mainly due to the fact that most people expend energy and emotion rather than function as pre-programmed citizens in a world taken over by money and deceit. However, this is still excusable if the film did not demand us to feel sorry for these characters who could not express ""sorry"" if you asked them.

Another issue with the problem is the unfocused narrative of the film. There are scenes, such as the introduction of the protagonist, that seem fuzzy and unclear, and for some individuals a second watch may be required so that certain ambiguities become clear. A narration would not be necessary, but due to the apathy of the characters, it would help the film progress more smoothly and seem, at certain points, less tedious.

There is no doubt that Bresson intended this chilling atmosphere to resonate through the entire film, but unfortunately this style of his overpowers the film and the philosophy he intends us to infer from it. By the end of the film, we have not seen a film that displayed to us the root of all evil, or a critique of French society, but we have witnessed a film that is depressing; so depressing and banal that any message that lays within it seems void, empty, and uninteresting.",1276041600,3,3149,4.740875912408759
7834516,5,6302993199,"A young man, Norbert (Marc-Ernest Fourneau), unsuccessfully asks his father for an advance in his allowance. He visits his friend, Martial (Bruno Lapeyre), and is goaded into passing a forged 500 franc note at a photography shop. The photographer (Didier Baussy) censures his business partner (Beatrice Tabourin) for accepting the forged banknote - the third counterfeit bill for the week - and decides to pass off the forged notes to an unsuspecting victim. When the serviceman from the oil company, Yvon Targe (Christian Patey), arrives to resupply their fuel tank, he is paid with the counterfeit bills. Yvon attempts to use the money to pay for a meal, and is detained by the police for forgery. In order to clear his name, Yvon hires an attorney to sue the photographer for fraud. But the photographer, unwilling to recant his false testimony despite the dire consequences it bears on the innocent Yvon, enlists his assistant, Lucien (Vincent Risterucci), to validate his claim and deny recognition of the serviceman as well. As a result of their perjured testimony, Yvon loses his job. Unable to find another job because of his tainted employment history, he descends into a life of crime, despair, and eventually, murder.

Robert Bresson creates a harrowing, caustic and socially relevant indictment of materialism and amorality in his final masterpiece, L'Argent. The protagonist, Yvon, is first introduced through a shot of his hands as he connects the fuel supply line. As in Pickpocket, the image suggests a figurative fracture between the body and the soul. However, in L'Argent, the body is not a biological entity, but rather, a representation of a material one: the universal mechanism of money - created, utilized, circulated. In the impersonal detachment of contemporary society, money serves as the surrogate for human emotion - love, guilt, shame, devotion, trust - are frivolously expressed through its casual exchange. But money also exihibits a biological behavior in its virulence - the forged banknotes, in essence, contaminate everyone who comes into contact with them. Norbert is punished for his childish prank. The photographer's reprehensible act escalates to perjury. Lucien's deception eventually leads to theft. Yvon resorts to a life of crime and brutal murder. Inevitably, the pursuit of money serves as a symbolic means for the destruction of the soul. As the counterfeit note serves as an imitation of money, so too does money, in turn, represent an artificiality - a false soul.",1262736000,,2515,5.225247524752476
