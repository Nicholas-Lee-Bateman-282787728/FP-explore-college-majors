5714774,5,6819903456,"I saw the dubbed movie that was released in theaters, and it was pure magic.  I would even put it up against the best work of Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli.  As far as this DVD it is obviously a bootleg/illegal copy as the movie won't even be released in Japan on DVD and Blu-ray until 26 Jul 17.  So I would not waste my money on it even if it was available.  I would wait for the real thing to be officially released.  No idea as to when it will be released on DVD or Blu-ray in the States.",1494460800,7,489,3.898989898989899
5714775,4,6819903456,"Visually, it's gorgeous. The city scenes, especially, seem rich with detail - but beautiful animation is pretty much the norm thee days.

The real draw is the plot - nothing at all like what I would have guessed. (If I seem vague, it's to leave you guessing, too.) It starts with a teenage boy and girl, magically inhabiting each other's bodies a day at a time, unpredictably. A very different movie would have made much of a male/female suddenly living with female/male bits - this pretty much dismisses the issue with a few laughs. The movie really gets under way when it turns out that they live in different years, somewhat like a plot device&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/elsewhere/dp/B000HEWHAU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">elsewhere</a>. Once under way, the movie grabs you when it turns out that the earlier of the two died some time in the years between them.

It builds from there, headed straight for a romantic finish - an end you'll have to see for yourself.

Although beautiful, I see this as a teen date movie - great for its target demographic and enjoyable to others (me among them(, but not one I need to return to.

5714776,5,6819903456,"Gorgeous anime in which a big-city teenage boy and small-town teenage girl swap places at night and affect change in each other's personal lives (just as soon as they've finished exploring their new bodies). The plot starts out fairly generic, but takes a twist in the middle that rescues it from ho-hum mediocrity and transforms it into something greater. It's very Japanese, in that both main characters speak in rapid-fire bursts, enunciating their every thought in a dreamy, poetic monologue, which alternately works for it and against it. There's a level of spirituality and self-discovery, too, that's left silent but constantly present, and a message about how important it can be to get in touch with the male and female aspects of our personality. Beautiful on many levels, not the least of which is its raw visual splendor. It's one of the most staggeringly lovely animated films I've ever taken in, stealing my breath with almost every scene; in many cases, I cursed myself for not speaking fluent Japanese because my eyes spent so much time on the subtitles. Both the rustic landscapes of a small, classical Japanese village and the crawling steel chaos of downtown Tokyo are fantastically rendered, sharing both a stunning aesthetic and a sense of warmth and familiarity by the closing scenes. A fresh, wonderful, touching tale with a little something for everyone, I'd dare to rank this with many of Studio Ghibli's finest.",1493596800,5,1437,5.042016806722689

5714779,5,6819903456,"This film. I have little to say about this film that others haven't already said, it's a magical experience especially your first time watching it, it'll make you smile it'll make you cry. This movie is not only very well written and very well voice acted, its a beautiful movie, the animation is completely solid, I have watched this movie once in a theater and once just now in my home and both viewings were gorgeous, the art has so many little details and little things for the keen eye to see in the background. This isn't a movie you should pass over, even if you don't like anime or animation, you should still give this movie a chance because it may just win you over. TLDR: Fantastic film with great story, very well written, absolutely gorgeous animation, voice actors did a fantastic job, watch it as soon as you can.",1530662400,,828,4.490066225165563

5714796,4,6819903456,"I will preface this review by saying I loved this movie, saw it in theaters and could not wait to buy the DVD. Movie gets 5/5.

The DVD itself is barebones, no special features/bonus content. It has the English Dub and the original Japanese with the option for English subtitles.  The only ""added"" feature is the inclusion of a few trailers, which is kinda redundant given the unskippable ads at the beginning of the DVD when you play it.

That's my only issue, the DVD plays well, functions as advertised.",1529452800,,506,4.6

5714810,5,6819903456,"This is one of the best animated movies of all time. It's also just one of the best movies of all time for all genres. I've now seen it over 5 times and I am not one to rewatch movies.

Animation Art: This is usually what comes up first. It's such a beautifully crafted piece of animation and film. The imagery, colors, attention to detail, and overall style is so fun to watch. I could watch it just for the art alone.

Soundtrack: I listen to Radwimps all the time now. Between the nostalgia and feelings related to this movie and just how powerful it is on its own, it has such an emotional, raw impact. It's such a beautiful soundtrack.

Plot & Storyline: The story is powerful. Interwoven in a way that makes you guess where it's leading with subtle foreshadowing and just to figure out where it's going it sucks you in. Then once you understand it allows you to fall in love with the characters. Little moments shared as you laugh at the characters and figure out their quirks. Finally the conclusion ends in a way that has you rubbed emotionally raw. I love the themes of the entire movie as well. The beauty in life (especially landscapes). Love can transcend space and time. The impact you can have on someone's life.

I could go on and on but this is a well done movie. I love it and if you are debating about checking it out I really doubt you will ever regret it.",1528675200,,1375,4.317829457364341

When it arrived, I noted the poor condition of the case and immediately knew that it was not new. I then checked and somehow I had bought a good-used item, which is very strange since I never buy used and wanted a new copy of this movie since I loved it so much. The Blu-Ray disk was relatively fine but the cardboard case was beat-up and ugly, the plastic case was cracked and the DVD had a defect mark and looked as if it had been dragged across gravel. Over all I was very disappointed and am being gypped of almost four dollars for the return shipping on this. Now I also have to go out of my way and buy another copy and wait another week or two so that I can get it new.

I don't wanna give too much away but this is a unique story of two people who live totally different lives and end up having the ability to switch bodies for a short amount of time. I love how they incorporated different cultural aspects within the story and giving people a sense of the life of cultural practitioners in modern day society and how living that lifestyle can affect our way of thinking.

The animation and the soundtrack alone is enough to bring me to tears... (Not because the movie is sappy, it's just really, incredibly beautiful. I really pay attention to the art styles for anime films.)
The story is really wonderful and combined with the amazing artwork and truly beautiful music, it still manages to give me goosebumps when I watch it. I watched the original Japanese version, and because that was the first format I saw for this film, it's what I continue to go back to....but I'm sure the English dubbed version will be just as powerful & enjoyable.

When it arrived in the mail I immediately popped the disc in my Xbox and sat back. It's not a movie you can play in the background and understand, you have to pay attention and connect some dots. The opening is visually and auditorally gorgeous, and the score to this movie, THE SCORE!!!! I've seen this movie four times now and my god is it an emotional and impactful story. It has left me with a sense of joy, and loss, and hope all at once. It has done something very few other movies, tv shows, or anime has been able to accomplish in me. It moved me. On my first watch it had me in tears by the end. On my fourth watch it keeps me on the edge of my seat as I once again travel along with two of my favorite anime characters I have ever seen.

5714911,4,6819903456,"What surprisingly became the #1 selling blockbuster anime movie of all time(so far!), Your Name is a romantic sci-fi comedy directed by Makoto Shinkai. Given his work on other titles like Voices Of A Distant Star and The Place Promised In Our Early Days dealing with starcrossed lovers separated by some otherworldly element.

Teenager Mitsuha lives out in the country, and helps maintain her family's shrine while hoping someday to move to the big city. Meanwhile, Taki is a loner high schooler who works part-time as a waiter in Tokyo. For some mostly unexplained reason, the two keep waking up in other's bodies, periodically switching their lives for a day at a time. Mitsuha keeps trying to help Taki with his interest in a waitress co-worker, while Taki learns more about being the troubled daughter of the pushy mayor of a small town. The two of them communicate with each other either through texting, or leaving notes to each other via notes, and sometimes on each other's hands. Taki then comes to realize he has feelings for Mitsuha when the body-swapping , and keeps trying to text her, but nothing gets through, so he sets off to find her mountain village. However, it turns out Mitsuha's village had been destroyed by a comet three years ago, and the body-swapping and texting taking place in real time during their own individual timelines. Now that he learns of her fate, Taki begins to loose his memories of Mitsuha, but one last body-swap sends him back to her body just before the comet was supposed to hit, giving him the chance to rescue the residents of town, including Mitsuha. This however sets up a new timeline where Taki and Mitsuha don't remember each other's prior experiences as ""each other"", but seem destined to recognizing themselves as they keep frequently meeting up nearing the finale.

Despite it's overwhelming success, and enchanting animation, the movie itself doesn't seem to play out like an actual feature-length film. It appears to be more like an OVA series compilation movie, including it's own episode intro theme. It works as an ongoing story, but putting it all into a single three-act film slightly works against it as alot of the mechanics behind the body-swapping and time dilation don't match up that well. You could just label the continuity flaws as ""time magic"", but considering that this is coming from Makoto Shinkai whose prior works paid particular attention to synchronizing alternate perspectives on time and space. Your Name is however an engaging modern day romantic fantasy, and sure to appeal to even non-otaku.",1523318400,,2577,4.94919168591224

5714981,5,6819903456,"I struggle to describe how I feel about this film without sounding like every other five-star review, so let me say this: the only type of person I can see saying this film is bad is the type of person who doesn't like things because they are popular.

This film blew me away. It is not perfect; there are a few (miniscule) parts that I don't feel contributed to the film in any meaningful way other than aesthetics. Visually, this film is a masterpiece. The term gets throw around lightly but I can assure you it fits here. The dub is rock solid. If you want subtitles then watch the original Japanese audio. If you think you want the dub don't let anyone tell you you're missing anything. It's stupid to argue over. The story was creative and it had me absolutely hooked pretty early on. I haven't seen a film that I've enjoyed this much in a very, very long time.

POTENTIAL SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT

The turns of the plot excellent. I figured out one or two before they happened but they were impactful nonetheless. The big twist near the middle of the film is among the best I have seen thus far.",1522022400,,1102,4.339805825242719

The soundtrack is quite excellent, as well. The subtitled version is the superior version, but the dub is still well-executed, for those who don't like watching movies with subtitles.

The bonus features are nice, as is having the DVD option on top of the blu-ray. If you are on the fence about this movie, *watch it.* You won't regret it.",1521849600,,577,4.948453608247423

The 2 star review is for the lack of language choice for the streaming show. If you like English dub, then you'll be happy with it. I only like Japanese with English sub on the anime I watch, because the English dub is clunky and gets in the way of the story, in my opinion. These shows are written for Japanese dialog, so the mouth and body movements work best with Japanese voice acting.

There were no warnings in the details of the description that this was English dub. In fact, the details alluded that there were English subtitles.

It's a story about two teenagers in different parts of Japan and the unlikely and amusing connection they share. Aside from the story itself, another part of what makes me love this movie so much is its soundtrack. I purchased this movie for my friend who watches a lot of anime and they loved it as well.

People can compare it to Studio Ghibili, but it's in a league all it's own.

Both Studio Ghibli and Makoto Shinkai are amazing creators, and Shinkai does pretty much everything himself which is completely amazing and brilliant.

5715001,4,6819903456,"I'd seen an enormous amount of hype surrounding this movie, and despite usually resisting the pull when something is THAT popular, in this case I was intrigued enough to investigate this film.  There was a lot of buzz surrounding it -- not only from the anime community, but from film-goers in general, hailing it as a masterpiece and one of the most touching romances to grace the screen in a long time.  In the end, I decided to give it a shot, if only so I could experience the source material before the inevitable American live-action remake ruined it.  (I'm not kidding, the film rights have been bought and paid for already...)

While not a perfect film, ""Your Name"" is a beautiful story, full of delightful comedy and genuinely heartfelt, emotional moments, with some gorgeous animation to boot.

""Your Name"" follows two Japanese teenagers -- Mitsuha, a small-town girl who resents her distant father and her role as a shrine maiden and longs to experience the big city; and Taki, a boy from Tokyo who juggles schoolwork and a job as he prepares for his future.  As far as both these young people are concerned, they've never met... so it's all the more shocking when they wake up one morning to find themselves in each other's bodies!  As they alternate between one another's bodies they start to leave each other notes, communicating and giving advice, and gradually they start to develop genuine feelings for one another.  But when Taki goes off to search for Mitsuha, he uncovers the shocking truth... and soon it becomes up to two star-crossed lovers to avert a tragedy and find a way to connect despite seemingly insurmountable obstacles.

The animation in this film is gorgeous -- easily on par with Studio Ghibli, albeit with a different creative stamp to some of the more fantastic visuals.  Movements are smooth, environments are beautifully rendered, and the film largely averts anime's tendencies to exaggerated facial expressions.  The characters do tend to suffer from same-face syndrome, especially the female cast, but this is a weakness of anime in general, I've found...

The story itself is an unexpectedly heartfelt one.  Sure, the film indulges in some goofy humor of the ""Freaky Friday"" variety, but it also has some unexpected heart and emotions behind it.  Some of the more fantastic story elements (such as the body-switching itself) aren't explained, but I found I didn't mind that -- said elements were there to drive the plot and didn't necessarily need explained.  And while I would have liked to see the first act of the film, with the body-switching and the two characters getting to know one another, expanded on a little more, I'm still mostly happy with the story as it is.

A beautiful film, one that can be enjoyed by anime fans and mainstream viewers alike, ""Your Name"" is a sweet and funny love story with a slight supernatural bent.  I encourage people to watch it before (or even instead of) the upcoming American remake -- you'll be glad you did.  Probably best for kids 10 and up due to some adult humor and intense moments.",1521072000,,3074,4.822857142857143

This is a beautiful piece of animation with a unique romance that even people who are not fans of the genre, or even anime, will enjoy. It includes the wonderful soundtrack by RADWIMPS in both English and Japanese although the English versions of both the soundtrack and film leave something to be desired. The way the box set splits open in the middle separating Taki and Mitsuha is a very clever detail. It also includes an art book which fans will enjoy.

It's very confusing because this listing has all the Japanese actors, lists that it has English subtitles, and a bunch of these reviews mention Japanese with English sub.

Five stars for the movie. One star for Amazon's confusing listing.",1518912000,4,631,4.633928571428571

5715096,5,6819903456,"Simply put, Your Name is wonderful. It's about a young man, Taki, and a woman, Mitsuha, from two very different parts of Japan - Taki is from Tokyo while Mitsuha is from a small town in the country - who switch consciousness. This movie is less like Freaky Friday and more like the underrated 2000 film Frequency as well as Shinkai's short film Voices of a Distant Star, which is also about a couple whose extraordinarily different situations complicate their desire to communicate. The movie has a lot to say about spirituality, the vastly divergent lifestyles between rural and urban Japan and a topic found frequently in modern Japanese cinema: the marginalization and lack of opportunities for young people, and it handles each one with elegance and grace. Speaking of, nearly every frame is jaw-droppingly beautiful. Even a shot of Taki's bedroom made me want to pause so I could take it all in.",1517961600,,900,4.85064935064935

5715100,4,6819903456,"I have been a fan of director Makoto Shinkais works for years, going back to Voices of a Distant Star, and while most of his works deal with love and loss, he has finally created a movie that cracked into the mainstream (of anime, at leastno Hollywood blockbuster, but shattering records in Japan and having a strong limited run in the US). A great story of two teenagers in unusual circumstances that form a bond over time. Yes, youve heard it a thousand times, but I don't want to spoil any of the plot accidentally (just read the product description, it doesnt spoil much).
This was the #4 top grossing movie of all time in Japan, and the top grossing anime film not directed by Hayao Miyazaki.
Stop wasting time, go watch it!",1517616000,,729,4.488721804511278

I love the focus and touch towards the surrounding environment, whilst maintaining the character's important features. I was skeptical of all the hype surrounding this, but looks like it's well deserved.

This comes with a DVD of the film along with the Bluray of the full anime (+ extras). I like the fact that the packet cover has been printed on both sides, so you can swap it around for a different look. Played no problems on my PS4, and looks seriously sharp at 1080p for an anime.

Now the bad:  audio and subtitle options are lacking.  There are no options to have the Japanese language and set the songs in English (the Japanese release has this option).  And then,  there is an English subtitle track if you choose Japanese but none in the English language track (you can still set the English subtitles with the English voice track but it doesn't match what is being said word for word so you know the subs are meant for the Japanese track).  Call it a habit, but I still like subtitles even if I'm watching a movie in English.  I know I can't be the only one.

A nitpick:  I don't know if it's my TV but I had a hard time navigating the menus.  The highlighter  and background are both set to blue.",1516233600,2,848,4.291139240506329

I had wanted to see this since it first got announced a couple years back and it didn't dissapoint. It's an emotion provoking movie with ups and downs all across the just over an hour and a half showing. The two lead characters are perfect and end up working really well together, and the ending was definitely one of the best parts. Definitely recommend this for any anime fan.",1515974400,,531,4.484536082474227
5715170,4,6819903456,"Absolutely stunning animation work. I was consistently blown away by the art featured in this film, muttering various obscenities to myself as I gazed upon the beauty of each scene. If you want something to dazzle you visually, you'll find few animations better than this (even Studio Ghibli). And while Your Name is great to look at the story isn't anything spectacular. Don't get me wrong it's a solid narrative but I didn't find it nearly as engrossing as the art style. It's also worth mentioning the soundtrack is pretty great and filled me with goosebumps at certain key moments. I tend to not watch a lot of anime but this is well worth the time, even the English dub (which I watched it in) is very competent and didn't leave me wanting. It feels a bit weird even giving this only four stars but with the weakness of the story (in my opinion) it wouldn't feel right giving it a perfect score. It's still 100% worth watching, especially if you are a fan of the visual arts.",1515888000,,980,4.51123595505618

5715172,4,6819903456,Soulful and tender time/location shift and identity anime has two teens inhabiting each others bodies in turns until circumstances dictate that they must meet at the same time.  Beautiful artwork and scenery propel an intriguing and at times disjointed story; very impressive 'thinker' that gets one choking up at the tenuousness of dreams.,1515888000,,340,5.415094339622642

5715176,5,6819903456,"With all the hype around Kimi no Na wa,. as it was originally named in Japanese, I wondered how I would enjoy it. The trailers seem to give the entire movie away. A comet makes two teenagers switch bodies. It's in all the trailers, leading you to believe that's all the movie has to offer. It isn't. What could have been a simple love story offers so much more. I've logged seven whole views of this film on Trakt, and I've watched it many more times in bits and pieces.

I think the first thing that really brings this film together is the soundtrack. While the songs were basically written for the film, as they developed, the film also grew around the music. Every time there's music playing, especially the three main songs (Dream Lantern, Zenzenzense, and Sparkle), the events of the film are timed to the tune of the music, making it feel like a music video. The first song is exactly that  James Bond aside, most moviegoers aren't really experienced with opening themes, but that's exactly what it is. So when the second song hits, it drops right as the characters realise what is happening, and it brings together their hectic and confusing differences. When the third song kicks in, you know you're strapped in for the big finale that was hinted at in the beginning. And then the fourth one, it plays partly over the final scene, and then in full over the credits. Listen closely to the lyrics as it beautifully sums up the story. It's the best use of an ending theme I've seen.

As for the animation, while the people are just okay, the landscapes really shine, and, as with Shinkai's other works (5 Centimeters Per Second and Garden of Words), you could make a desktop or phone wallpaper out of so many dozens of scenes throughout this film, provided you can play a Blu-ray on your computer (most cannot, but there is no shortage of said wallpapers online). My favorite scenes weren't of people, but of things. Watching this movie is like watching a work of art that moves. My favorite shot is in one of the last scenes, it's a bridge over a river with the sun setting behind it. Or the scene with the snow falling over the city. Or the overpass with the rain. The autumn leaves in the river. The city skyline shots with the NTT Docomo Yoyogi building (I had to look up what it's called, it's in a lot of anime set in Tokyo, and it's their fourth tallest building).In fact, as architecture is an important part of Taki's story, the architecture is almost always worth looking at.

With so much to say about the look and feel of the film, one wonders if there's anything worth mentioning about the plot, beyond the obvious. While I don't want to give anything away that the trailer does not, this is a quintessentially Japanese story about city life vs rural life, and relationships not only with family and friends, but of culture and religion. While religion is an abstract, optional part of our lives in Western civilisation (and even so in Tokyo), we see how it's a very real part of rural life, without being condescending or patronising at all. The god whose temple Mitsuha's family has been tending for generations is given a context and even a voice without being some supernatural deus ex machina. Arguably, there are some confusing bits, particularly near the end, but on a repeat viewing, with the context of what you saw before, it comes together so much better. And having seen it start to finish, all the way through, seven times (a few of those times being in Japanese, at least once with the subtitles turned off), I feel like each time I appreciate it more. Also, I watched it with my infant niece (she was 5 months old at the time), and she was completely captivated by it, stared intently at the TV and did not fuss the entire time. It might be the first movie she's actually watched.

Lastly, I don't have a verified purchase because I bought it from the publisher. Big Mistake. They took over 2 weeks to get it to me, even though I preordered it the first day preordering was available. They didn't have enough and I, among others, drew the short straw, and to top it all off, they put out a call on Facebook for people to share their reactions to their new purchase, and were generally rude and dismissive to those of us who had to wait. Meanwhile, people who paid a buck or two less on Amazon got it on release day. Never again. Next time I will just buy from Amazon.",1515715200,2,4400,4.495

I'm not a fan of spoilers of any kind, so I suggest watching this movie without reading up on it (watch a trailer, avoid reading the plot). It does have a twist or two, so I would suggest being careful of spoilers.

Hearing how powerful this film was and not being able to see it until over a year later, words could not describe how much anticipation I had for seeing 'Your Name'. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed!

An amazing story, relatable characters, a beautiful blend of comedy and drama. Some of the most incredible 2-D animation I had seen in years along with an amazing soundtrack by The Radwimps, Your Name is a film that you cannot skip. This needs to be watched by everyone, Anime fans, animation fans, film appreciators...EVERYONE WILL LOVE 'YOUR NAME!'

How did the Academy Awards overlook this film? How did this film not get a wide release in the U.S.? How is it that everyone, their mother and their cousin twice removed is NOT talking about 'Your Name?!' What are you waiting for? See this movie!

This is a romantic story in the truest sense. Makoto Shenkai's master piece without a doubt.
Not just a great story but a really beautifully rendered anime. Visually detailed and colorfully rendered. Shenkai's animes have always been beautifully done, but this is the latest and the best so far. If you're a fan of Shenkai, this comes as no surprise, but the story is also well done.
I don't want to give away anything, but if you're not into teenage, high school romances, then you might want to pass on this... maybe. I wouldn't though because this is such a good story.
The story is a little complicated for simple, young minds. If you're looking for an anime for a toddler, this is not it. Teenagers and adults, yes!
Blue ray really shows off the colors of this anime amazingly well!
Watch this anime, you won't be disappointed. It's award winning for a reason, and I think it going to win some more awards still.",1514505600,2,1112,4.50990099009901

5715246,5,6819903456,"Its not hard to see why Makoto Shinkais Your Name has managed to captivate audiences around the world. The hype and buzz surrounding the film is well deserved and further solidifies Shinkais place in the future of Japanese animation and filmmaking.

On the surface, Your Name checks all the boxes for anyone familiar with Japanese anime and even Asian romantic dramas. It is an easy story to follow, despite having several intricacies, not the least of which being the supernatural and fantastical element that is present. But the universality of youth, love, family and friendship allow the film to be accessible and relatable. There is a sense of nostalgia and sentimentality that successfully couples with the ethereal visuals and writing.

All these qualities are very familiar to me and anyone else who may have seen some of Makoto Shinkais previous work. For me (so far), it is the films 5 Centimeters per Second and The Place Promised in Our Early Days. 5 Centimeters Per Second was especially excellent as it featured a wonderfully moving and realistic slice of life story. Though more fantastical than 5 Centimeters, Your Name carried the same amount of poignancy and sincerity that allows its multi-faceted story to be both quiet and adventurous at the same time.

Makoto Shinkai has showed he has a knack for such stories and he does them well. Your Name may contain familiar themes and even story beats, but it isn't any less affecting or satisfying for anyone whos hopped on for the ride.

The overall appeal of Your Name might be its romantic charm. Both Taki and Mitsuha believe they are dreaming at first. Your Name itself feels like such a dream. Greatly aided by the beautiful animation, the story naturally, but quickly builds around Taki and Mitsuha. Not just their relationship with each other, but the relationships they have with other people and the relationships around them. The film also touches on the relationships both have with their city or town. The contrast is another common theme in similar Japanese anime.

Ultimately, Makoto Shinkai is able to take another step forward in announcing his presence to the world. And thats no easy task when Japan has been home to some of the best and most original storytellers, especially in animation. Your Names poignant, emotional, romantic and just pure fun story easily show why the film has become a worldwide critical and commercial success.",1513900800,,2419,4.977722772277228

5715248,5,6819903456,"""Your Name"" beings with emotive music and a star falling through luminous clouds. The theme of eternal longing begins quickly and lasts throughout this beautiful anime film. This is a romantic and intimate story of two teenagers who's souls swap bodies for days at a time. They never know when it is going to happen and sometimes this makes it all the more humorous. Mitsuha is a girl living in a rural village and Taki is a boy living in Tokyo. Mitsuha really wants to live in Tokyo and when the body swap happens she gets her dream.

I felt that this film was a stunning visual experience. The autumn leaves look so realistic and the rain and rivers are so beautiful. The forests also look wonderful.

This is one of those films that will stay with you after you've experienced it. I am still trying to figure out the time travel elements which rather boggle the mind. The last part of this movie is quite complex and I still don't fully understand some of the mystery of this story. You will also learn something about Japanese culture and religion along the way. A Japanese ritual is central to the movie's plot.

Watching this film is like being put under a spell. You feel very dreamy at the end. The conclusion is positive but there is still the element of uncertainty. So I loved this film and can recommend it to adults as the plot seems too complex for children.

Maybe non-fictional characters and storylines are more relatable? It has been more than 5 years since I last watched anime.

Even though there were some elements that seemed unrealistic, it was easy to understand which elements were real. Say no more.

It didn't exactly benefit my language skills, but the scenery was amazing -- could it possibly be more real? -- and the story -- simply transcendent.

Until now, the only movies I could bear to watch repeatedly are The Godfather and The Godfather Part 2.

I will say, however, when I tried to watch it along with others who wanted the English dub -- it was not quite the same.  It was difficult for me to enjoy without the original dialogue.",1513468800,7,689,4.614754098360656

5715272,5,6819903456,"I saw the trailer for this movie and had heard how amazing it had done in Japan. I had almost bought the version of this which is only spoken in Japanese with English subtitles, and switched when I found this was the correct version I was looking for (English language makes these movies easier to enjoy!).

I had never heard of the director before, and honestly I still can't remember his name (I could look it up, but chances are most of you are as familiar with the name as I am. I've heard his movies are great, but this is the first I have gotten.

The movie itself is incredibly fun! There are a couple gags included that you would honestly expect to happen when a teenage boy and girl switch bodies, which makes for some hilarious moments! But it also had several surprises in store that you will never see coming!

I am a little torn up about the ending emotionally. I think they could have extended it just a little bit longer and had it pull the emotional strings even more (but in a good way!). Nonetheless, the ending was good, and the movie is highly enjoyable!

The music and the backgrounds are incredibly fun and detailed, respectively. I'm going to end up buying the soundtrack for this movie, which I will only do for movies whose music I really enjoy. The backgrounds, according to one of the special features, are based on real-life locations in Japan (at least, the Tokyo locations are). It definitely feels like modern Japan, or at least how I think of it.

Overall, you are definitely missing out if you don't watch this movie, especially if you are a fan of animated movies!

5715282,5,6819903456,"""Your Name"" is the type of anime film I would show to people who aren't really into anime. It is peak storytelling of the format. Throughout the film the animation quality is brilliant, the storytelling between Mitsuha and Taki is extremely well executed, and everything comes together in a beautiful display of why I fell in love with anime decades ago.

Hollywood (and probably live action) can't really tell a story as beautifully put together as ""Your Name"", largely because I think there are inherent qualities of animation that sometimes makes it a better medium for telling stories in a certain way. People can't express the dynamic range of emotions as quickly as can be expressed in animation, and real life is often full of bland color that isn't as beautiful as animation can be done. Reds are more red, greens are more green. Dark can be lighter and light can be darker.

At any rate, a beautiful film that comes highly recommended.",1512864000,,944,4.785276073619632

The characters are immature and childish. Towards the middle to end, the appeal that the writers were relying upon was the boring trope of ""misunderstanding"" and ""lack of communication"" rather than some actual plot.

5715289,5,6819903456,"Just finished watching ""Your Name"" released by Funimation.
Simply breathing taking animation would be an understatement to describe this movie which was written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, based off his own novel of the same title
While ""Your Name"" is a lush, full color animation, I was at times, as the story unfolded, reminded of the novel and early black and white movie of the same title.
For some reason unknown to them, high school teenagers  Mitsuha and Taki are switching bodies.  Naturally this causes complications as the two, who at first believe that they are dreaming, soon come to the realization that something bizarre is happening and they set some ground rules, but both can't help interfering in each other's lives as they come to the realization that they are following in love with each other, despite Mitsuha's best efforts to set Taki up with a girlfriend, even setting up a date with an attractive co-worker of his.
Yet just as they realize that they do love each other and resolve to meet, circumstances keep preventing them meeting or even connecting with each other over cell phones.
At the heart of the mystery is a comet that makes a pass at Earth every 1,200 years.  As the mystery unravels, Taki soon realizes that if he is to save Mitsuha, he somehow must find a way to finally meet her.
A compelling story with animation that is on par with  Studio Ghibli!
HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

The characters and their everyday struggles feel real and grounded in the midst of a sci-fi/fantasy scenario. And the story really keeps you in suspense from the beginning to the end, and had me guessing at every turn. Sure, some of my guesses turned out right, and you can say it's predictable in that way, but the execution was very satisfying in the end.

I am a huge fan of Shinkai's 5 cm per Second (another movie I highly recommend), and when I heard this movie was coming to the US, I was hyped with all the anime fans.

[Your Name] is such a sweet, gorgeous movie, not just in its visuals but also in the high school romance story. Watching the movie spoiler-free is a must to truly experience the movie. However, [Your Name] is a movie that can be watched over and over again, despite knowing the twist, and experience something new and old everytime. This movie has layers. LAYERS.

You can watch this when you are tired after work or school. You can watch this when you are energized. You can watch this when you are feeling down. You can watch this when you are feeling bored. It is such a visual feast that you can play the movie as a background while you do something because whenever you look back at a random point, there will always be a beautifully animated scene waiting for you.

The artwork in the movie is just beautiful; I can't say enough of how truly incredible it was to be so absorbed in the movie thanks to strong artwork. It's also buoyed by a strong soundtrack. Radwimps zen zen zense is the biggest single but its accompanied by a beautiful accompanying ensemble. I have listened to the soundtrack a lot just randomly I'm really enjoying.

Makoto Shinkai proves he is worthy successor to the great Hayao Miyazaki with this brilliant film. Stick with it through the first confusing 10 minutes, as they set up the premise in a somewhat confusing fashion. However this only adds to empathizing with the characters situation and overall adds a positive feel to the film as you settle into the story at the same pace as the characters.

This belongs in any collection, and reminds me of classics like Sleepless in Seattle and The Notebook with a dramatic twist and an anime flare. I feel the need to mention that this film avoids many of the off-putting anime trends which often serve as time filler or cheap laughs. There is no excessively awkward dialogue nor any gratuitous imagery, which goes a long way to establishing this as a title that those who typically avoid animation can enjoy.

An intricately plotted and  visually sumptuous film that left us with the feeling that we had just seen something truly marvelous, thought-provoking, and pregnant with meaning. At peace, if such could be said for a film with a fair degree of dramatic tension towards the end. As my spouse said: ""I haven't seen a movie that good in a long time..."" How right! The idea of braiding--of string and lives--comes up over and over again; as part of gentle primer on some aspects of Shinto as well as weaving other elements of Japanese culture into the film. The color palette is rich and inviting (the Autumn colours are a good example) and shows off the blu-ray format to excellent effect. One wants to linger in these moments (as Miyazawa would do) but the film moves on.

5715360,4,6819903456,"EDIT: the below review was for the Japanese limited edition, not the English one, this review was done when the US release was not even released yet.

This is a review for the set, not the movie. I wouldn't rate the movie itself less than 5 stars.

General: This set contains a Bluray of the movie, a DVD of the movie, an artbook, and the soundtrack, along with a digipack

Box: I think the box was designed with a sync to the movie in mind, but isn't very practical in average use(even though it looks pretty, taking out from a shelf is strange) The art on the box is actually pretty cool, I think, it shows the two ""star crossed lovers"" looking out toward each other somewhat as you can see from the cover pics, but on the back, it shows their backs and their respective environment.

Digipak: I like the look of the Digipak, but while I think it looks awesome, its missing something.....and is spoilerific...

Artbook: The art-book is about 60 pages(61-62 really) and it has wonderful art in it. Most likely its all based on post cards that were in the Japanese promotions here and there, some of it is in the book that you get with the Japanese Limited Edition with a ton of interviews about the movie.

Sountrack/OST: The Soundtrack is wonderful, it sounds kinda country+rock+chamber kinda. Its strange, but I love it. Its the same thing as the external OST though that you can buy for $10 or so, from what I've seen, its the exact same content, the exact same codes on the disc itself.(the bottom of the disc for instance has product ID codes, it'd be the exact same thing, if it had a separate upc from the LE of the set itself, it'd probably be the exact same thing as the $10 OST, I imagine)

My honest opinion is that: the movie is wonderful, and the Japanese version with subs and the English version all toghether are both fantastic. The packaging on both are wonderful, but set to a different audience, thus the difference in content. The Japanese Limited edition had a similar price(90$ instead of $80) but it contained a LOT more(bookmark made of filmstrip like material with a screenshot from the movie, interview book, TONS of bonus features spanning HOURS of content, script book, the 4K version of the movie among other things), but no OST. For the price, I think its good, not great, but good.",1511049600,4,2313,4.519138755980861

5715363,5,6819903456,"I saw Your Name mentioned in a few articles on the Net. I did not know the works of Makoto Shinkai but I added it to my Amazon list. A sale happened so I bought it.

I must say I love this film.  People who like Studio Ghibli will see it's influences in this film.  The great art work, music and characters. Miyazaki always had a rule that you will never see his female characters run from problems. Such is the case here.

The story is about Misuha and Taki. She lives in the country and he lives in Tokyo. A cosmic event happens and they find they are switching bodies as they sleep. What is really good about this story is how they go about figuring out what happened. Both think it's some kind of vivid dream but things start pointing out something is amiss. Mitsuha finds a note asking who she is. Taki finds events on his phone. The friends simply think they are acting strange or having an off day and just roll with it. Taki feels the need to play with her breasts and is always interrupted by Mitsuha's little sister. She simply stares and makes comments ""you sure like your booobies!"" with that little girl disgusted voice. Mitsuha wakes and finds things are just not right. She reaches down between her legs and screams! Slightly adult humor but done in the right way.

You really take a liking to these two as they slowly develop by improving each others lives. She organizes him and sets up dates. He makes her more aggressive with dealing with situations and people. Taking from that old line; they complete each other. There is well crafted humor all through the film. They make rules such as no touching and no looking! They get annoyed with each other and write insults on each others faces.

I would like to write more about it but that would be bigger spoilers. So I will just say eventually Taki does go on an adventure to find Mitsuha and there is an unexpected surprise.

This was a fun movie that will stir emotions as the story goes on. I have watched it twice and found it still puts me in a good mood and wishing there was more story with the two. I wish there would be a sequel but sometimes it's best to not do that.

If you liked the scenery in this film; make sure you watch the extras and you will see places used in this film (others as well) and you will be amazed how close the drawings were to the real life places.

I will again mention the music. As with Ghibli, the music sets the mood for the scenes which you will see.

All in all, I will say this is one of my favorites.",1510963200,,2511,4.256302521008403
5715364,5,6819903456,"///Spoilers I Guess\\\

I'm not going to make this review about the product because I've already seen plenty of analyse dissecting this movie and all why its good and bad; rather, this review will be on this specific product and how it stands against the Japanese version so many of us saw in theatres, planes, or even on the internet

First off Funimation did not disappoint me, when getting this product it really was a win win for me because I already like the base product which is the movie with subs and and english version was only icing on an already fantastic cake I was however, interested in hearing if they managed to catch the same feeling I had when watching this the first time and I would say that they did.

The packaging is what you'd expect, a sleeve with just the movie, yes the cover is holographic and I can acknowledge the artwork used to make the product but its really just par for the course in my mind.

The Blu ray doesn't have to many extras but I will say that the trailers they decided to put on this disk really fit the overall idea of the movie and actually interested me in shows that I had previously disregarded, that isn't very easy for me because I usually just don't care about any of the trailers put on the disk.

On to the Dub, I've heard plenty of shows where the script and chosen voice actors jive really well and shows where I want to just go back to subs; I went into this show with very high expectations not really about the voices but the script. To put it simply, I would say that it kept the story flowing through its 1 Hour and 52 Mins and captured the basics I still remembered from the the sub version. There are a couple of parts that I felt diverged from what the sub conveyed but even those parts still made me feel the same way as I did before. Michael Sinterniklaas did a wonderful job adapting this product for an english audience. Speaking of adapting

I said before that the dub managed to capture the feelings of the source material well in my mind, one example of this comes from the beginning; Taki's and Mitsuha's speech patterns in the original play a vital part in the story letting both the viewer and the characters come to the conclusion that they have swapped bodies. In the Japanese, for non-Japanese speakers, this is somewhat difficult to convey as we see all this as text on a screen. We have no experience hearing the differences in dialect so we take what is happening for face value but in this english adaptation, It was easy and very noticeable that while it may have been the voices saying the words the delivery and intent behind them were from very different people. When Mitsuha wakes up in Taki's body his mannerism and speech change, not only did the characters in the show notice it overtly, I felt it when I uttered the words ""This voice isn't quite adding up to what I expect,"" but when they switched back everything made more sense and worked. After stewing on that for 20 mins I realized that, that is what the director wanted us to feel, that something is wrong or off. This show is filled with moments like that which is one of the biggest reasons I would highly recommend this movie. Also, it was nice hearing definitive answers where as some of the sub was more open ended; Miki Okudera's relationship in the Japanese version, was in my mind, one where she liked the Mitsuha side but not the Taki side. In the English version she states that she liked the change that he displayed and not the person in the body. One seems a lot nicer than the other and is one of those changes that managed to keep the flow of the show even though its a bit different; it was easy for me to digest, well easier than it was in subs.

This movie and dub is perfect for people dipping their toes into Anime, it is creative and whimsical enough, a bit corny at times, there are some plot holes but, its easier to understand than an Ghibli movie and the story can be just as deep; Its a modern Anime Movie. While I consider Ghibli movies in their own category this is definitely a movie that I would pull out for friends on movie night at my house just like Summer Wars.

BTW this show had a very Summer Wars feel to it, I spent some of the movie wondering why I was thinking of that movie then it dawned on me; Michael played the lead in Summer Wars.",1510963200,4,4327,4.326757090012331

But this is a review on the internet, so I'll have no such reservations here. This movie almost feels like a turning point in my life. Kind of like how BC and AD is to the human race, there is my life before ""Your Name."" and my life after ""Your Name."" It has changed me. It made me recall feelings that I hadn't felt since I was a teenager. It has helped me see beauty in every day occurrences. (Twilight will never be the same.) And there is no other film that can make me tear up by just thinking about it. Simply humming a song from the soundtrack brings images to my mind that overwhelm me. And I wouldn't say this movie is tear jerking in the traditional sense. While there are some parts that CLEARLY exist to elicit a reaction, there is one epic moment towards the end of the film where all the parts of the whole come together; the animation, the story, the MUSIC, and the grandeur of what is happening on screen just overpower me to the point where I'm sobbing. I love this film. If you are a hopeless romantic who is willing to lose themselves in an impossibly beautiful and epic story, look no further. I'm tearing up just writing this review... I'm done!

I watched the movie that same day and saw the movie started skipping late in the film, specifically the part where Mitsuha goes to talk with her father. It kept skipping for the next five minutes of screen time, so I returned it to get a replacement copy. I got my new copy, watched it as well, and had the exact same problem.

The only thing that was a negative (but not worth to count off a star) was the fact that Funimation could have made the title screen text clearer when you have highlighted the text. For example, if you want to change the language it is SOO hard to see what text you have highlighted because there is not enough contrast. It's not the end of the world, but it is definitely more difficult to navigate the menu. Anyway, highly recommend this version!",1510444800,,508,4.593406593406593

Points for that for sure. The art book is a very nice touch, but i always find it odd why they include the art in an artbook. You can't really see the entire image on each page because of the binder. I would say a nice set of art cards would of been ideal. Now, where the bluray and soundtracks are located, i'm not really fond of. it's one of those foldable cases that houses all 4 discs. i personally don't like that. i would of preferred an actual bluray case to house all 4 discs. but thats really the only gripe i have with this set.

5715420,5,6819903456,"The case:
The box case is nice. I like how they have it split down the center, very representative of the story. The second disc for the OST can be a little tough to get out, you just have to be careful--push down hard on the center button and carefully lift from the end.

The BD menu:
I wish they had kept Katawaredoki as the theme for the main menu, as they did for the Japan release. It is instead more upbeat ""First View Of Tokyo"" and corresponding theme (sky, Tokyo, etc.). I wonder if that is due to US commercial pressures.

Art book:
The art book is definitely neat and fun to look at, appreciating anime art.

English release:
It turns out I'm not a fan of the English dub. As noted previously, there are times when translations don't work out so well. One that Makoto himself mentions in the bonus interview is the part where Mitsuha (as Taki) refers to herself as ""watashi"" and in English it is just ""I"". The scene makes no sense in English. There are also other times when you can see Mitsuha moving her mouth despite her not talking and instead her sister is talking... The sister also says things like ""what a jackass"" instead of ""what a fool/idiot"" in the scene where Mitsuha yells out that she wishes to be an attractive boy in Tokyo in her next life. It really changes the mood at times like that, as you wouldn't expect the little sister to say something like that.

Bonuses:
The interview is actually pretty interesting for understanding Makoto and his making of your name. It also teaches you a bit about what people who have been fans of Shinkai's works felt about your name., including why some would consider this movie ""anti-Shinkai"" when comparing to his other works.

There is a TV special/program that I didn't really look into because something similar was in the Japanese BD release. You basically see the hero/heroine VA's talk about your name and Shinkai.

There is a filmography bonus showing Shinkai's other works. It was interesting to see how his style had changed/improved over time. I had only seen 5cm per sec besides your name, and I enjoyed that too. These are just short previews/trailers of his other works.

The story is a decent one, 3.5 stars at best, but nothing really to get so worked up about. As to the moron who reviewed this stating they were hoping for a plot that would ""push or play gender roles"" more I can tell ya' don't go into this thinking this is an LGBT+ anime for crap sake because it's not.

I watched the movie with my wife, who doesn't usually like a lot of anime, and she was in tears by the end. This story is in no way cheesie or clich.

I found myself cringing through the soundtrack music, which was very stripped down and heavily accented English (maybe they should have left it Japanese).  And I concur with the other reviewer who said it shouldn't be rated PG.  If I had kids watching this, we would have had problems within the first five minutes.

Your Name is a masterful take on my favorite set of emotionally manipulative tropes for a love story. Lovers bound together by the threads of fate, but separated forcibly through a series of heart wrenching trials. Flawless art, great writing, strong pacing with no wasted scene screen time, and a very effective soundtrack.

I would compare it to the tropes used in Steins;Gate, Angel Beats, Puella Magi Madoka Magica, or Dusk Maiden of Amnesia. If you like those you will LOVE this. It's much better put together than any of them.

There are some gaping plot holes you could drive an 18 wheeler through that support the conflict and exist mostly for convenience, but for me that didn't detract from the experience.

I'm not someone who watches movies multiple times. To me they are one shot experiences and once I've had it there is nothing to be gained through repeated viewing.

I missed the movie while it was playing in the theaters, and now I don't think that's a bad thing, since I managed to get a DVD with both English and Chinese subtitles with the original Japanese voice acting rather than a dub.

The plot begins simply enough as a body-swap between two teenagers separated by a huge distance: one lives in Tokyo while the other lives in the country-side. The plot picks up dramatically when the swapping stops, and suddenly little details that originally seemed meaningless become important. There's a science fictional element in the plot (beyond the body-swapping), but the story focuses mostly on the characters and never bothers to explain the mechanism, which is a good thing, as no explanation would have been satisfying.

Ultimately, we learn to care about the characters and their tenuous connection with each other. Along the way we get some exposure to Japanese culture in a good way. Recommended.",1507680000,4,1215,4.975369458128079

I understand this is some sort of Sci-Fi movie. But being Sci-Fi does not mean that you can make up logic and common sense does not apply. The boy and girl had switched places frequently and often for the entire day. I can understand that the experience maybe dream-like and therefore they do not remember details (like where the girl's school is, etc). I could not understand how they not realized that they are 3 years apart. They were writing diary for each other! The climax rescue related to the meteor is also unconvincing but I will leave out the details. IMHO, a sad ending would be more logical. Overall, I think the movie is still entertaining.

5715457,5,6819903456,"""The disease which humans are last affected is ""hope"".""
This quote originated from Saint-Exupry, the French author of ""The Little Prince"", is one of the sales copies of this film.

Blockbuster films always reflect an atmosphere of the era.

Once in Japan, in exchange for the energetic economy having drastically arisen by the recovery from the WWII, people had lost the relationship with others. Recently, they also released their economic advantages to other countries which has been their last resort. Moreover, tossed about by social network services targeting each person's approval desire, human relationships acceleratingly have become vacant. Nowadays, a sense of stagnation is spreading throughout the country.

Through this process, the chronic disease gradually infected people and several levels of their communities including nation, companies, men, women, young, elderly, and even children. The name of the disease is ""hopeless"".

In this film, a boy and a girl face the impatience that is not easily accessible to each other, quite typical in orthodox romance stories. Unlike the other ones, this irritating situation is highlighted by contrasting the spatiotemporal distance between them, and also the distance between this world and the other world derived from a Buddhism concept. This distance as best blend of these scientific and religious descriptions is the straightforward metaphor of the desperate gap between hope and hopeless in our reality.

Body switching, Sci-Fi, young romance, beautiful CGs, catchy songs, etc.... Crowd pullers are smartly packed into this film though, outstanding was its title. ""Your"" is the most equal word for everybody. Definitely this word sense gave sympathy to any generation, even to the elderly, thereby reminding of their own experiences: ""whenever and wherever in your life, fortune can be (or could have been) encountered."" This universal message could touch one's too dry mind like an oasis in a desert.

About sixty years ago just after the WWII, exactly the same titled film was also the blockbuster in Japan, when people had surely the hope to reconstruction supported by firm human relationships nevertheless in poverty. On reflection, since today's people are living in the era of a digital visualization of everything, they may retrospectively desire such an analog type of ""hope"".",1506297600,4,2350,5.460055096418733

5715475,5,6819903456,"This is a stunning piece of cinematic genius. The story, the music, the imagery, everything is breathtaking.

I remember first seeing this as an option on a Delta flight, so I decided to watch it as I had heard good things. I was not prepared at all for the artistry that this film brought to me. I got off the flight and thought ""I need to see this on the big screen"". And I did. It was even better.

Detailing a tale of two teenagers, Taki and Mitsuha, who mysteriously find themselves randomly switching bodies, the film follows their experiences until one day, the switch just stops. Concerned for the girl who he's never actually met face to face before, Taki goes on a journey to find her. The story basis is not particularly gripping upon first glance. However, the way this story is told and the unexpected twists in the story grab your hand and pull you deep into a world in which everything, literally everything, is connected.

To write this story off simply because it is a Japanese Animated Feature Film (or an 'anime') would be a sin. Having lived in Tokyo and having traveled through out Japan, I found myself completely entranced by the imagery. I felt like I could reach out and touch what was on the screen, look around, and I would be in the metropolis once again. It was startlingly accurate in detail and inspiringly touching in that regard. The message of the film, that we are all connected and can make a difference in the lives of those we've never even met before brings to the heart an all too real emotion of what the Japanese call 'nukumori', or rather, the warmth we feel due to human connections.

In short, I highly recommend this film. Not only is it a wonderful story, beautiful, and scored with a out of this world excellent soundtrack by RADWIMPS, ""Your Name"" is spectacularly enchanting and ready to use the 'strings' that tie us all together to bring viewers a feeling of unity and hope in a world desperately in need of such things.",1504224000,9,1971,4.52808988764045

The movie needs certain knowledge about Japanese culture, or at least, East Asian ones to get the deepest feeling. English translation (sub or dub) can't really reveal such taste (the script and grammar are well arranged to fit the scenario, the ending song, too).

The most important thing about this movie is the book mentioned by Ms. Yuki (Japanese teacher) in the movie: Man'ysh. The whole timeline is based on this ancient poem collection. So when I saw Taki delivers Sake in autumn, I knew there will be a downturn soon. This is based one chapter in Man'ysh. chilli winter is always after beautiful autumn.

5715479,5,6819903456,"Your Name (Kimi no Na wa) is Makoto Shinkai's most successful film to date, surpassing box office records worldwide set by Miyazaki's Spirited Away more than a decade ago. Like all of Shinkai's other films, you can expect stellar animation. You can't help but marvel at his attention to detail. The soundtrack is also composed and performed by one of Japan's more well known bands, RADWIMPS, and it blends so well with the movie.

Shinkai draws many inspirations for his film. He explains in an interview that his initial inspiration came from a commercial he did for Z-Kai, a company that provides educational resources to Japanese students. The commercial, Cross Road, highlights a boy and a girl who live in completely different ends of Japan, prepping for their high school entrance exams. In the end they coincidentally meet each other.

Similarly, the movie's main characters are a boy living in Tokyo and a girl living in the countryside, both wearisome of their mundane daily life. One day by chance they somehow come to meet each other. I'm going to avoid writing anymore as to not post any spoilers but do yourself a favor and watch this movie one way or another.

5715483,5,6819903456,"Your Name is a Japanese animated film written and directed by Makoto Shinkai, based off his own novel of the same name. I was reluctant to watch this movie at first because besides the works of Studio Ghibli, I am not the biggest fan of anime. However, Your Name was making waves around the internet, with people considering it the best anime movie of all time. I am someone who is naturally gravitated towards hype, and with expectations leveled, and my mind opened, and I went ahead and saw the film. And boy, when the credits rolled, I was stunned, mesmerized and enchanted with just how beautiful this movie was in every way. My relationship with anime does not extend beyond Ghibli films, first few seasons of Pok&eacute;mon and JRPG cutscenes, the reason being I always feel Japanese animation lacks gravitas and instead replaces it with heavy-handed over-the-top storytelling and voice acting. I was glad to see Your Name not succumbing to any of those tropes, in fact, Your Name being an animated film, was able to make laugh, cry, feel anxious and fulfilled all within 90 minutes, something most live-action movies with real actors cannot even dream of trying.

Your Name is about two people from different parts of Japan, through some cosmic fate, body-swapped with one another. Mitsuha, a girl from a small rural town, wakes up in the body of Taki, a boy from big city Tokyo, and vice versa. Not knowing why this is happening to them, they both communicate via leaving messages on each others phone and notebook. Mitsuha, always dreaming of the big city and tired of her country life, takes this magical opportunity to live in Tokyo and runs with it. They both help each achieve things they otherwise would not have been able to achieve. And through interactions with each others friends and families, they begin to learn about one another. One day, however, the body-swapping stopped, and Taki sets out on a journey to find Mitsuha to meet her in person.

Mitsuha and Taki, our two leads are very charming and funny. The main hook is you hardly see them as themselves, instead they are mostly in each others bodies. Because of this, we see their characters develop as they literally walk in each others shoes. The first act to my surprise was candidly funny. I found myself laughing out loud at the fish out of water and situational jokes. There is a running gag where every time Taki would wake up in Mitsuhas body, he would feel her boobs to make sure he is not in his own body, this is when Mitsuhas little sister would burst in the room and see her sister touching herself. Comedy like this is perfect, because it is within character, situational and not forced.

I am going to avoid all spoilers for the second act onwards because I went in the movie knowing very little, and I wish for anyone watching this film to do the same. I will say there is an obstacle in the third act that is suspenseful and tension-filled but not in a Hitchcockian way. Instead, you just want to see the characters succeed and achieve the impossible so much, that when an obstacle stands between them, you cannot help but to be on the edge of your seat. I was rooting for them because I was emotionally invested in Taki and Mitsuha as human beings, and I care about them, and genuinely want a happy ending for them.

Having some time to think about the movie after seeing it not too long ago, I felt Your Name connected with me on in intimate level few films have done before. Ever since I was young I was a romanticist, always believing the meeting with the love of my life is bound by some sort of fate and destiny since the beginning of time, and I simply have not found her. The movie explores this subject, what if you are tied to a person by a string? You two through thick and thin, chaos and peace, no matter the time difference, spatial difference, are destined to meet? A story of this kind would have touched my heart regardless of the quality of the actual film, but thankfully, besides having an excellently written script, the movies supplemental elements like animation and music do not lag behind.

The hand-drawn animation in this movie is probably the best I have ever seen. Every frame was perfectly crafted and colors are rich and vibrant. I especially appreciated the little details like water droplets on a spider web during the raining scene and of course, the deliciously animated food throughout. The movie was truly like a painting coming to life and rivals with even some of Ghiblis best. Another thing I need to mention is the music, composed by Japanese rock band, Radwimps. It was simply fantastic, amazing, incredible, heart-warming, heart-wrenching and every adjective that is associated with the word nostalgic. Funny how a piece of music you have only heard for the first time recently can give you the feeling of nostalgia, but that is the power of this films soundtrack. My favorite piece is Date that plays during Takis date with his co-worker. The track accompanying the sunset imagery and Tokyo caf&eacute; evokes a poignant, bittersweet sentiment within me, and I absolutely loved it. It makes me think back of times in my life where I was in a similar situation as Taki, and the feelings I had then, the moment, the sunset, the yearning of days gone by.

I cannot review this film without drawing some parallels to another romantic comedy I really love, (500) Days of Summer. While they do not have the same plot at all, there are some elements I found eerily similar. Both films deal with supposed cosmic significance about finding true love, both Tom and Taki are architects, and both are job hunting for that profession towards the end of the films. Not sure if it is only a coincidence, but I just wanted to point that out.

Your Name is a brilliant, heart-felt animated film about two different peoples absolute desire to meet one another despite being separated by space and time. Taki and Mitsuhas conviction that leads them to the end of this emotional journey should be viewed by everyone, no matter if they like anime or not. This film is simply a masterpiece in storytelling that has everything you want in a romance. Go see this movie, you will not be disappointed.",1503360000,123,6213,4.658158614402917

Shinkai has had a lot of successful films released over the past years that left a huge impression on the anime community, but not in a general mainstream sense, as most, if not all of his films were independent successes. Your Name. Serves as Shinkais very first fully mainstream film and while the jump from independent to mainstream may turn off a lot of people, true talent knows no such limits and this film is proof of that. I've been keeping tabs on this movie since 2016 when it came out in Japan, researching more about it while waiting for its inevitable US release, and even went as far as to create a petition for it to get released where I live, in Puerto Rico, which sadly failed despite the support it got. I didn't let that stop me however from experiencing this landmark masterpiece in theaters and I made it my New Years resolution to see it in theaters. Well, I traveled from Puerto Rico to the US and finally saw the film on opening night and while this review will not contain spoilers, I can summarize the whole film in one word: Perfect!

Story and Plot:

Your Name. Tells the story of Taki and Mitsuha, two teenagers from two different sides of Japan who have dreams of one another despite not knowing who the other person is. In a bizarre turn of events, the two find that they start to unexpected wake up in the other persons body, and have no choice, but to live life in the other persons shoes, while incidentally, getting to slowly, and surely, know the other person in more ways than anyone close to them possibly could. This movies story may have elements from existing films that other people might look at and find laughable in theory, but after seeing this movie, witnessing the struggle that these two had story go through while living another persons life, I've never thought I would ever find myself touched and emotionally moved by such an unexpected gem such as this one. Without giving a single thing away, this movie is in many ways, a long distance love story between two people who fell for one another without getting the chance to meet normally like normal people would.

What Shinkai accomplished with this story was something that I never in my wildest dreams could have imagined was possible: creating a beautiful story between two star crossed lovers who had plenty the chemistry and development together, despite not being physically next to one another. Theyre relationship as demonstrated in this film, is a reminder of just how powerful the bond between two people can be and how we are never truly far away from each other, no matter the distance. As someone with a similar relationship myself, I completely understand the outlook this movie was trying to give. Shinkai is a man who knows how to ground a story in reality while providing the best and worst that life has to offer, but with this movie, he created something that even films with similar ideas and concepts failed to perfect. Cobble this up with a lovely slice of Japanese culture presented on screen, some of which is crucial to the plot itself, a horrifying twist that catches the viewer on edge wondering how the conclusion will turn out and an ending that will leave many in happy tears, Your Name. is a landmark in storytelling both in anime, and film in general.

Cast and Characters:

A story as perfect as Your Name. Wouldn't be possible without the many amazing characters this film possesses and before getting to the main characters, I wanna talk about the supporting cast. First we have Katsuhiko and Sayaka (voiced by Kyle Hebert and Cassandra Morris in the English dub which I saw), Mitsuhas best friends who share very wonderful friendly chemistry with her as much as they do with each other, and even when Mitsuha herself gets in over her head, they're always on her side ready to show their support. Alongside Mitsuha is her sister Yotsuha (voiced by Catie Harvey), who loves her sister unconditionally despite finding her crazy and occasionally teasing her for constantly fondling her breasts (which was all Takis doing since he can't help himself) and her grandmother Hitoha (voiced by Glynis Ellis) who takes care of both Yotsuha and Mitsuha after their mother passes away years beforehand. On the other side, we have Takis friends Tsukasa and Shinta (voiced by Ben Pronsky and Ray Chase), who despite making jokes at his expense, show how much they truly care for their friend, even going as far as to travel with him, or even cover his shift at work when the situation calls for it. Along his friends, there's also the lovely Ms. Okudera (voiced by the equally lovely Laura Post), Takis workmate whom he has a crush on, and who shows her support for him, despite their past history with each other.

All of these characters are voiced beautifully by the lovely voice cast courtesy of Funimation, who also distributed this wonderful film theatrically all over the states, and every character was given a unique level of charm and wit fitting for said character capable only by the actors voicing them. Finishing up this wonderful cast, are the leads of the film, Taki Tachibana and Mitsuha Miyamizu (voiced by Michael Sinterniklass and Stephanie Sheh). Taki is a high schooler living in Tokyo who spends his time working in an Italian restaurant, which I'm genuinely surprised that there would be one there to begin with, and Mitsuha lives in a rural town in Japan where she finds herself wishing to live in Tokyo instead, as she dislikes the life she currently lives, mainly due to how boring and monotonous it is, but also because of the bad relationship she has with her father, whom she also dislikes because of how controlling and strict he is. Both of these characters are good enough on their own, but together, they form one of the greatest pairings that I've ever seen in a movie, and what makes them more compelling is just how fantastic they're voiced. I loved Michael Sinterniklass performance as Kenji in Summer Wars, so I was really excited to see an anime film with him voicing the leading role once again, and as for Stephanie Sheh, I expected nothing less from the lovely voice of Eureka from Eureka Seven. This is handsdown, the best performances from both Michael and Stephanie and I was moved multiple times by the level of emotion they brought to each of the characters they voiced.

Animation and Musical Score:

In typical Shinkai fashion, Your Name. Features visuals and animation that go beyond simply being a treat for the eyes, and instead provide depth and scope unlike any form of animation I've ever seen before. Every scene feels like staring at a beautiful painting while walking around in a museum, while the level of detail to tiny things such as signs, buildings, overall scenery and even the clouds and the sky. The lighting however, is the most amazing aspect of the animation in my opinion, as the film uses so many beautiful colors to distinguish different lighting effects around the film, wether it's city lights, or more impressively, the lighting used on the comets in the film. This is a gorgeous looking movie in the sense that it feels more like an art piece than any animated movie I've ever seen, even more so than anything done by Studio Ghibli. The character designs have that same Shinkai style grounded in solid realism with limited expressions familiar to those people normally experience, and the animation feels fluid and smooth. This is, without any doubt, the most gorgeously animated film I've ever seen, and given the over saturation of 3D animated movies (not saying they're bad), it's tough to find 2D animation nowadays with the same level of detail that Your Name. Possesses.

As for the musical score, it's nothing short of wonderful, and compliments the scenery and scenes in question, backed up by the other stars of this film, the band RADWIMPS. The band serves as an unsung hero in the film, whos colorful soundtrack became iconic on its own right. Not just by how amazing they are in general in terms of their music, but also with the lyrics and I was extremely surprised that they dubbed over their already existing soundtrack to give a consistent English speaking tone with the film. Essentially, taking an already perfect sounding soundtrack and giving two great ways of enjoying it while watching the film.

Overall Verdict:

The hype truly was real for this movie and despite waiting since August of last year for it to come out, I can say that the wait was way more than worth it, and Im not just saying that. Your Name. Is an unmitigated visual and storytelling masterpiece unlike any released in this decade, or in the past one. It truly shines above some of the greatest works in the anime forefront and also as one of the greatest movies ever made, period! I've been using the word perfect a lot in this review, a word I rarely use unless very conservatively, but the truth is, that while I like to believe that no movie is without its flaws, I always believed that a flawless movie was difficult, but not impossible. Your Name. Rests on the same pedestal as other masterpieces animated or not like Spirited Away, Beauty and the Beast, The Godfather and The Shawshank Redemption; all of which are films that I consider to be universally flawless, and now among them rests Makoto Shinkais greatest masterpiece ever. Believe the hype, go see it where available, you do not wanna miss this movie.

5715486,5,6819903456,"Written and directed by Makoto Shinkai (Journey to Agartha, The Garden of Words), Your Name (original title 'Kimi no na wa') is a beautifully animated and surprisingly complex film, a whole level higher than the trailers would lead you to expect. If you've seen the trailers for Your Name, you'd probably expect this film to be a typical anime body-swap romantic comedy. And you wouldn't be entirely wrong, for that is indeed how it starts. But around the middle of the film, you suddenly discover that there's another element to the story that you weren't aware of, even though, looking back, you can see that the clues were there all along. And from then on you find yourself immersed in a much more serious story with far greater consequences than you'd previously thought.

The film opens to a night sky lit up by a wave of comets shooting across the stars. The voices of two teenagers, a boy named Taki (Rynosuke Kamiki) and girl named Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi) begin to speak, almost simultaneously. They speak of time and of dreams, and of loss. And then a piece of one comet breaks off and plummets to the earth

The scene then shifts to Mitsuha in her room, having some kind of dream. She calls out to Taki, asking him if he remembers, but then she wakes up. But it is not Mitsuha who's waking up, it's Taki, who is startled to find himself apparently in a girl's body (but not so startled that he can't resist squeezing Mitsuha's breasts to see if they're real). He is interrupted when a young girl - Mitsuha's younger sister, Yotsuha (Kanon Tani) - comes into her room, noticing Mitsuha/Taki ""being weird again"" and tells her breakfast is ready. When she leaves, Mitsuha/Taki, stares at himself/herself in the mirror, baffled by what is apparently a recurring dream he seems to keep having.

Once dressed and downstairs, Mitsuha, who seems to be back to her normal self, eats with Hitoha, Mitsuha's grandmother and guardian. Hitoha and Yotsuha note that Mitsuha had been acting weird the day before. At school, Mitsuha flips through her notebook and finds a message asking ""Who Are You?"" More strange things become evident. Mitsuha learns from friends that the day before she had apparently forgotten her classroom and where her locker was. This information shocks and surprises her. Sayaka chalks it up to stress Mitsuha is under to perform a Miko ritual for the family shrine, something Mitsuha doesn't want to be reminded of. As the three walk home, they bemoan how small their town of Itomori is; there are no restaurants, bookstores, or social scene. Mitsuha herself dreams of graduating school so she can move to Tokyo. ""I hate this town!"" she screams at one point. ""I hate this life! Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!""

The next day, Mitsuha wakes up but not as herself. Now she is in Taki's body and is quite disturbed to be a boy and all that entails physically. Finding out she has overslept, Taki/Mitsuha quickly gets dressed and heads out, suddenly realizing that she is not in her village but in Tokyo! Arriving at school rather late, Taki/Mitsuha is accosted by his friends Shinta and Tsukasa, who note that Taki has been acting weird as well. They suggest going to a caf, and Mitsuha readily agrees as there are none where she lives. Getting a call on Taki's phone, she realizes Taki has a job at a restaurant and she is going to be late.

This intermittent switching of bodies between Mitsuha and Taki continues to happen. Their memories of each other fade quickly, like dreams, but they realize the experiences are real when their friends and family tell them they have acted strangely recently. They begin to communicate by leaving notes in Mitsuha's notebook and memos on Taki's phone, and end up intervening in each other's lives. Mitsuha helps Taki develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki helps Mitsuha become popular in school. As Taki leaves Mitsuha's kuchikamizake as an offering in the family tomb on a mountaintop outside the town, Mitsuha tells Taki about a comet expected to pass Earth on the day of her town's festival.  To say more would amount to a major spoiler, but from this point on the story takes a major and highly unexpected turn.  And it's what makes Your Name really worth seeing.

Highly, highly recommended for anyone who enjoys beautiful animation and a story that elevates the film beyond what you would ordinarily expect.",1502928000,32,4418,4.766013071895425
5715487,5,6819903456,"Finally we get an English Dub and Sub version! As of writing this review Amazon does not have the details for what is included in the Limited Edition. Here it is: Your Name Limited Edition contains two-piece double-sided collectible chipboard box with rainbow holographic finish; 2-disc original soundtrack by RADWIMPS, with English and Japanese versions; 60-page hardcover art book, and Art digipack.

I was able to see this in theaters during its limited run in North America. I was blown away by the artistry displayed in this animated film. I heard the hype before seeing it and it met those expectations, which not many films can do. Makoto Shinkai, the director, has been a favorite of mine for a little while now and many are calling him the next Miyazaki. While I am not a fan of those comparisons, I can say that Skinkai's style is very entertaining to watch and absorb. His use of light and hyper detailed backgrounds really suck you into his films. He tends to lean in to young characters who are in some sort of long distance relationship and Your Name is no different. The two main characters are a joy to watch because they come from opposite sides of Japanese society, but both are tied together by the events of a strange meteor that passes Earth every few hundred years...There is much more to be said about the story, but talking more about it would give away key details that I believe would be better off not being spoiled.  And before I wrap this up, I would like to say that the music for this film is superb. I find myself often listening to a few key tracks whenever I get a chance.

If you have a friend or family member that has little to no anime experience, I would show him/her this film. Anime is so broad and diverse that it can be hard to give good suggestions to new watchers, but I believe Your Name is a perfect introduction.

Thank you for reading my review and have a good day.",1502928000,432,1914,4.491379310344827

5715494,3,6819903456,"This review gets only three stars - the film itself, in the original Japanese voice cast and either Radwimp's Japanese or English soundtrack is outstanding. But, be aware the extras, interviews, lectures on these Japanese import discs DO NOT HAVE English subtitles, only the film itself (two, actually, one for the japanese and one for the english musical soundtrack, since the wording is changed for the English flavors of the songs.) Of course this also doesn't include Funimation's English voice cast, either. That edition arrives later this year.

The movie itself, spectacular. Anyone familiar with Children Who Chase Lost Voices, Five Centimeters Per Second, etc knows the attention to detail that Shinkai puts into his animations' visuals. I bought the 4K (5 disc) JP release and don't regret it for a moment, I don't expect Funimation will ship the 4K print of the film, but will buy a copy for the English voice cast. If you know his earlier work, you would know that he writes stories of missed connections, impossible loves, disaffection and alienation, young adults ""out of step"" with their immediate surroundings. You won't be disappointed, this is the reimagination of many films he previously released, with a much more optimistic final outcome. But he inevitably drags the viewer through many other bad endings throughout the film.

The actually boy-and-girl-swap-bodies which is teased in every trailer is not the actual point of the film. That lead plot only survives the first 1/3 of the film before the story becomes much more textured, complex and engaging (the body swap parts are critical to the film as a whole, and are often very amusing, but sometimes too cliche. Although this is a mature movie meant to be understood by teens or adults, there is little here that would be objectionable, many parents would find it acceptable to watch with their 7yo.

Because this ""bonus"" version does not include 4K UHD, and the extras are worthless without some Japanese language skill, this is not the version that English speakers should buy. The less expensive single-disc, or more expensive 5-disc with 4K are both interesting in their own rights. But not this edition.

5715499,5,6819903456,"This is a stunning piece of cinematic genius. The story, the music, the imagery, everything is breathtaking.

I remember first seeing this as an option on a Delta flight, so I decided to watch it as I had heard good things. I was not prepared at all for the artistry that this film brought to me. I got off the flight and thought ""I need to see this on the big screen"". And I did. It was even better.

Detailing a tale of two teenagers, Taki and Mitsuha, who mysteriously find themselves randomly switching bodies, the film follows their experiences until one day, the switch just stops. Concerned for the girl who he's never actually met face to face before, Taki goes on a journey to find her. The story basis is not particularly gripping upon first glance. However, the way this story is told and the unexpected twists in the story grab your hand and pull you deep into a world in which everything, literally everything, is connected.

To write this story off simply because it is a Japanese Animated Feature Film (or an 'anime') would be a sin. Having lived in Tokyo and having traveled through out Japan, I found myself completely entranced by the imagery. I felt like I could reach out and touch what was on the screen, look around, and I would be in the metropolis once again. It was startlingly accurate in detail and inspiringly touching in that regard. The message of the film, that we are all connected and can make a difference in the lives of those we've never even met before brings to the heart an all too real emotion of what the Japanese call 'nukumori', or rather, the warmth we feel due to human connections.

In short, I highly recommend this film. Not only is it a wonderful story, beautiful, and scored with a out of this world excellent soundtrack by RADWIMPS, ""Your Name"" is spectacularly enchanting and ready to use the 'strings' that tie us all together to bring viewers a feeling of unity and hope in a world desperately in need of such things.",1500854400,20,1971,4.52808988764045

...have you ever witnessed something in your life so beautiful that you cannot even begin to construct the words to describe it? Or seen something that afterwards has you feeling some kind of way? That is exactly how it felt watching what i shall consider one of the best films i have ever seen in our modern times. It may be too soon to call it a masterpiece but Makoto Shinkai....you are one genius deviant.

Starting off with the animation and visuals....its just gorgeous, what else is there to even say? Never would any one imagine a smartphone looking so stunningly animated and that is only the beginning. The locations used are based on real life locations and when placed side by side it's hard to deny the parallel details that went into making the movie. The animation is simply breathtaking and more than enough to make one appreciate the film even more.

Let's take a moment to appreciate how beautifully the Radwimps songs tie in with the film. Not only does it up the emotional level, but they fit in so well with it's entire dynamic. The songs convey the feelings occurring both in the moment and what is to come. They serve as a monologue ""in betweener"" for what is going through the main character's heads.

The main story and plot was nothing new in all honesty. I'm sure that the whole ""body switch, time travel"" has been done countless times before. However, what makes Kimi No Na Wa unique from its predecessors is it's execution. Every action was done (almost) so perfectly that it avoided becoming too convoluted, which many series that tackle this subject fail to accomplish. It puts a great twist on the cliches and makes it definitley enjoyable never showing a dull a moment.

Overall, my final rating for this film is...amazing and a 9.5/10. I know there was so much hype for it, but after viewing it you will realize how it deserved everything it has achieved so far. Any prior expectations were blown away. As stated earlier, not enough time has passed to label it a masterpiece, but it is definitely one of Shinkai's best. Everything about it was done so beautifully, from the astounding visuals to the perfectly blended in music.
This film will send you on a feels filled emotional rollercoaster of a journey that will leave you in tears by the end. The English dub was not half bad, if anyone cares, but I suggest subs because the songs and certain phrases they say have more impact in Japanese.",1499040000,11,2504,4.620224719101124

It is now one of my favorite films and I would definitely suggest getting it.

Positive: I had been avoiding this one for a while now thinking that I would just wait, but I kept seeing the movie's trailer repeatedly pop-up on my Youtube account & let me tell you when I finally saw this movie it took my breath away.

HELL, I even remember watching ""Clutch Cargo,"" for Chrissake! If the aforementioned rant means anything to you, then know this: This is the BEST anime feature film I have ever seen. I don't throw out that endorsement lightly,  There are those that will say: ""But what about Miyazaki's .....(fill in the blank).""
  I LOVED ""Spirited Away."" It is still one of my best animated films of all time! (Number two behind ""The Emperor's New Groove."" - what can I say? I love ""buddy"" flicks?""
  This film, however, is different.. I won't give anything away, but it encompasses the past and the present. It sets up a bizarre juxtaposition of time that, unlike ""the Girl Who Could Leap Through Time,"" explains every nuance of how this happened... eventually.
  It's witty, heartfelt and every other movie adjective you want to throw at it. For the parents of younger viewers, one of the lead characters seems to have an obsession with her (clothed)  ""boobs,""...  which makes perfect sense later in the film. She does grab them repeatedly throughout the film, however (again, clothed).
  One of the things that I love most about Anime in general, and this film in particular, is that it does not ""spoonfeed"" you, the viewer. The plot opens up mid-sentence, as it were. It is only through careful, attentive watching that you understand what is going on. I just love the ""aha!"" moment, when the viewer ""gets"" what is going on!

5715517,5,6819903456,"Written and directed by Makoto Shinkai (Journey to Agartha, The Garden of Words), Your Name (original title 'Kimi no na wa') is a beautifully animated and surprisingly complex film, a whole level higher than the trailers would lead you to expect.  If you've seen the trailers for Your Name, you'd probably expect this film to be a typical anime body-swap romantic comedy.  And you wouldn't be entirely wrong, for that is indeed how it starts.  But around the middle of the film, you suddenly discover that there's another element to the story that you weren't aware of, even though, looking back, you can see that the clues were there all along. And from then on you find yourself immersed in a much more serious story with far greater consequences than you'd previously thought.

The film opens to a night sky lit up by a wave of comets shooting across the stars.  The voices of two teenagers, a boy named Taki (Rynosuke Kamiki) and girl named Mitsuha (Mone Kamishiraishi) begin to speak, almost simultaneously. They speak of time and of dreams, and of loss.  And then a piece of one comet breaks off and plummets to the earth

The scene then shifts to Mitsuha in her room, having some kind of dream. She calls out to Taki, asking him if he remembers, but then she wakes up. But it is not Mitsuha who's waking up, it's Taki, who is startled to find himself apparently in a girl's body (but not so startled that he can't resist squeezing Mitsuha's breasts to see if they're real). He is interrupted when a young girl - Mitsuha's younger sister, Yotsuha (Kanon Tani) - comes into her room, noticing Mitsuha/Taki ""being weird again"" and tells her breakfast is ready. When she leaves, Mitsuha/Taki, stares at himself/herself in the mirror, baffled by what is apparently a recurring dream he seems to keep having.

Once dressed and downstairs, Mitsuha, who seems to be back to her normal self, eats with Hitoha, Mitsuha's grandmother and guardian. Hitoha and Yotsuha note that Mitsuha had been acting weird the day before.  At school, Mitsuha flips through her notebook and finds a message asking ""Who Are You?""  More strange things become evident.  Mitsuha learns from friends that the day before she had apparently forgotten her classroom and where her locker was. This information shocks and surprises her. Sayaka chalks it up to stress Mitsuha is under to perform a Miko ritual for the family shrine, something Mitsuha doesn't want to be reminded of. As the three walk home, they bemoan how small their town of Itomori is; there are no restaurants, bookstores, or social scene. Mitsuha herself dreams of graduating school so she can move to Tokyo.  ""I hate this town!"" she screams at one point. ""I hate this life! Please make me a handsome Tokyo boy in my next life!""

The next day, Mitsuha wakes up but not as herself. Now she is in Taki's body and is quite disturbed to be a boy and all that entails physically. Finding out she has overslept, Taki/Mitsuha quickly gets dressed and heads out, suddenly realizing that she is not in her village but in Tokyo! Arriving at school rather late, Taki/Mitsuha is accosted by his friends Shinta and Tsukasa, who note that Taki has been acting weird as well. They suggest going to a caf&eacute;, and Mitsuha readily agrees as there are none where she lives. Getting a call on Taki's phone, she realizes Taki has a job at a restaurant and she is going to be late.

Mitsuha begins switching bodies intermittently with Taki, a high school boy living in Tokyo. Their memories of each other fade quickly, like dreams. They realize the experiences are real when their friends and family tell them they have acted strangely recently. They begin to communicate by leaving notes in Mitsuha's notebook and memos on Taki's phone and intervene in each other's lives. Mitsuha helps Taki develop a relationship with his coworker Miki, while Taki helps Mitsuha become popular in school. As Taki leaves Mitsuha's kuchikamizake as an offering in the family tomb on a mountaintop outside the town, Mitsuha tells Taki about a comet expected to pass Earth on the day of her town's festival.

8580294,5,6819903456,"As Hayao Miyazaki has gotten whiter of hair and older in age, the quest to find the next Miyazaki has steadily increased with mixed results for any anime directors so described.  On the one hand to be publicly described as the Next Miyazaki is a great honor; on the other hand it is also a stupefying burden, worst of all largely decided more by mere opinions than anything one can measure,.. with a single exception.  The latest Next Miyazaki, Makoto Shinkai, earned his designation the old-fashioned way: by writing and directing the highest grossing anime film of all time in 2016, actually beating the legendary Miyazaki himself for the first time in a long time, with Your Name.

Though knowledge of Shinto and Japanese can make some things a good deal clearer, it was Shinkais genius to tell a story that doesnt really require said knowledge; Americans and other foreigners should have no trouble grasping the main premises.  After some decidedly interesting opening scenes (that will be more fully revealed when repeated and expanded later), Your Name opens with what seems to be Yet Another version of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Freaky-Friday/dp/B07CHS7B3X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Freaky Friday</a>: a boy living in Tokyo, Taki, and a girl living in the boondocks, Mitsuha, mysteriously find themselves switching bodies for a day, two or three times a week, and after realizing this, set some ground rules and leave each other notes on their cell phones and notebooks, sometimes even writing on each others skin, in order to cope with this mysterious problem.  They also use their talents to help each other out: Mitsuha builds Takis potential relationship with the college student he has a crush on, Taki boosts Mitsuhas popularity, and everything proceeds along very nicely.

But there is a dark side looming, and the indicators can be seen more clearly upon rewatching.  In a twist reminiscent of the first season ending of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Steins-Gate/dp/B00KU3Y5CG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Steins;Gate</a>&nbsp;a truly horrific fate is coming, and soon Taki and Mitsuha are desperately trying to save over 500 lives,... including one of their own.  The price for doing so is high, and the movie fades to what appears to be a sad end as the price for the miracle,... only to end with another miracle.

Your Name was such a box office smash that it suddenly focused a huge amount of attention on the previously barely known Makoto Shinkai, and most people were astonished to learn that far from being his first film, Your Name was actually his eleventh, the seventh made available over here, though none before were anywhere close to being as successful.  (Your Name earned over fifty times more than anything else he ever did.)  And while none of these previous films were quite as good as Your Name, there was clearly genius at work in all of them, and they are certainly worth viewing.  One thing that becomes clear upon doing so is that Makoto Shinkai is that rare thing, a short story writer rather than a novel writer, and that he has a tendency to cut too much that needs to be corrected, proven by the fact that he has later written 6 mangas and worked on 3 light novels based upon his animes and every single one of them is an improvement, ESPECIALLY in the additional scenes and much clearer endings.  Anyway here is what you can find and see so far:

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Voices-of-a-Distant-Star/dp/B000BKSJ5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Voices of a Distant Star</a>&nbsp;(2002) his breakthrough 25 minutes long CoMix Wave short about two young school children falling in love who are separated by an alien invasion; she is sent off to fight it, while he remains at home awaiting her cell phone messages, where the wait for light speed transmission grows from 6 months, to a year, to 8 years.  The movie ends with him after all this time preparing to enter the military and (hopefully) be reunited with her.  It is another stunningly beautiful short story, showing bits and pieces of their lives.

The dream in this altered reality in which Japan has been divided between Hokkaido and the rest, between the USSR and the USA, is to build and fly a plane to a mysterious, impossibly tall tower on the island of Hokkaido, allegedly used by the Soviets for the exploration of alternate realities; the girl is fellow student Sayuri Sawatari that they are both in love with.  However, her disappearance fractures their friendship and stops work on their plane, but three years later they are reunited by circumstances leading towards a world war.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Children-Who-Chase-Lost-Voices/dp/B01DEQ98HW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Children Who Chase Lost Voices</a>&nbsp;(2011) his third feature, 116 minutes long, and IMHO Makoto Shinkais biggest failure yet (I call it Viewers Who Chase Lost Endings for a reason), an attempt by a short story writer to do a Miyazaki style film, an epic adventure into a Hollow World about which it reveals almost nothing.

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Garden-of-Words/dp/B00CJ7Y19I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Garden of Words</a>&nbsp;(2013) his fourth feature (and most successful before Your Name) and at only 46 minutes in length, yet another short story about a couple of misfits, divided by age, but nevertheless drawn together by circumstances and weather until they are driven apart but with hope for the future.  It is also notable for being much improved in the later written&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/manga/dp/1939130832/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">manga</a>&nbsp;and as-yet-unseen light novel by Makoto Shinkai.

Note: It is not uncommon for animators to briefly insert characters from previous films into later films (Miyazaki did this a lot) without necessarily needing to logically be considered connected to the originals, but there is a huge difference between something like that and the character of Yukari Yukino, a small character in Your Name who was also one of the two main characters in Garden of Words, with the same look, the same name, the same profession (literature teacher), and was portrayed by the same voice actress, Kana Hanazawa.  What is significant about this, though unstated, is the presumed character arc of Yukari, who has gone from being saved by Takao Akizuki from being all but immobilized in her life and her career in Garden of Words to surviving a comet strike in Your Name thanks to the frantic efforts of Taki and Mitsuha.  I wonder what she did and what she became as a result of it all?  And I wonder if Makoto Shinkai will ever tell us?

Note: The contents of the various versions are a little more complicated than usual so let me explain them.  First, the Blu-ray of the movie contains a couple of special features, subtitled specials about the movie, not present on the DVD.  Second, the three versions are set up like this: the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD/dp/B074QVZJFZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD</a>&nbsp;version contains only the DVD, the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blu-ray/dp/B074R4KSTM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blu-ray</a>&nbsp;version contains both the Blu-ray and the DVD, and the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Limited-Edition/dp/B074QVZD11/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Limited Edition</a>&nbsp;version contains the Blu-ray, the DVD, and a couple of soundtrack CDs: one containing all the BGM plus the 4 songs in English, and another containing only the 4 songs in Japanese.",1530921600,,9056,6.00776397515528

8580296,5,6819903456,"For anyone wondering, the (Original Japanese Version) does have subtitles, as I was wondering it myself as it isn't clearly mentioned.  The other ""Your Name"" is just an English dub.

This will go down as one of the best films of all time.

If you haven't seen this movie, you are missing a piece of art and a story that shouldn't be left out of your life.  There's something incredibly unique and beautiful about this hand-drawn art - time, passion, and traditions, that can never be duplicated by 3D animations pumped out by computer software that we're all used to in the United States.  Every scene in this movie is immaculate - a qualified desktop wallpaper or piece of art that could be hung on your wall, and all of it looked stunning watching it on my OLED65B6 TV.

The characters are loveable, the artwork is unbelievably good, the story is unforgettable and ends perfectly, all of it leaving a pleasantly warm pressure in your chest.

I've watched both the English sub and dub (via Amazon Video).  If you want the true experience in the manner of which was meant to be watched (being a Japanese movie), then watch the English sub.  The English dub just can't perfectly replicate all the scene by scene cultural nuances and voice inflections as well as Japanese voice actors (which makes sense as this is based in Japan, with Japanese characters, in Japanese culture, etc).  But if you're not a subtitle fan, the English dub won't hurt your viewing experience, as the voice actors did a fairly good job, and even the music featured was also translated/sung in English convincingly well!

The creator, Makoto Shinkai was extremely modest, being the Japanese man he is, and even felt his own creation was incomplete - whether or not that's true, I'm truly grateful I was alive to see this.  With all its perfections and imperfections, ""Your Name"" is....
