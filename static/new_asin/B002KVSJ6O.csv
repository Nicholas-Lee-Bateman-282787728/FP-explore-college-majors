3945095,2,B002KVSJ6O,"I love Buster Crabbe and Flash Gordon is a terrifc serial. Buck Rogers however... in fairness Buster give it the college try but the production values are bargain basement and the story line is grade school level. Did I enjoy it, yes but only for the fun of watching Buster. There are a couple of decent story elements - the ""transporter"" idea, which was copied 30 years later by Star Trek and and Anti Gravity belts - good touches, but too little too late. Watch it to round out your serial viewing, but don't expect anything too great.",1308528000,,537,4.489795918367347
3945096,5,B002KVSJ6O,"First things first:  BUCK ROGERS is rather weak and disappointing compared to the two FLASH GORDON serials (1936 and 1938) that preceded it and that also star Buster Crabbe - though I think it's at least the equal of the last FLASH (FLASH GORDON CONQUERS THE UNIVERSE).  It looks even cheaper - I think FLASH had at least a couple more sets and not every outdoor shot was done in the same rocky western terrain - and it lacks a couple of the major ingredients that make those first two Flash serials as fun as they are:

- a good villain: Killer Kane (Anthony Wade) despite having a vague resemblance in his attitude and power to Hitler or other real-world totalitarians comes off more as a dull third-rate gangster; Charles Middleton's Ming is a hundred times as charismatic and has a wacky New York accent that sticks out so much you can't help but laugh.

- a good heroine: again, Constance Moore's Wilma Deering is just plain boring - not I think through the fault of the actress so much as the writing.  She just has nothing much to do except occasionally take orders from Buck, get rescued, or help in rescuing.  She wears dumpy clothes and there's not the slightest hint of a love interest - until literally the very last moment of the whole thing, when it seems totally out of place.

I do like the set-up to the whole thing - dirigible pilot Buck Rogers and his sidekick Buddy crash in some inaccessible mountains and through a miraculous experimental gas are left in suspended animation for 500 years.  Of course, when they're thawed out they IMMEDIATELY join the forces of the obvious good guys in the Hidden City to overthrow the tyrant ruling the world, Killer Kane.  You'd think people would be more suspicious....and the plot of course piles implausibility on impossibility for the remaining 11 episodes.

BUT if you already like serials and know what you're getting into, it's lots of fun.  Same silly doors with the submarine-like valve mechanisms as FLASH; same spark and sound effect on the spaceships (which look like the Civil War ironclad Merrimack for the most part), lots of silly dialogue and the occasional ahead-of-its-time ideas, like an early usage of mind-controlled robots, and a teleportation chamber.  Lots of Wagnerian and generally grand-sounding 19th century romantic music that mingles strangely with the cheap sets, silly plot and constant repetition.  Oh, and of course the infamous chapter-beginning crawls and creative wipes between scenes that George Lucas was to homage (or ""steal"" if you're not so charitable to Mr. Lucas) in STAR WARS and its sequels.

This VCI 70th Anniversary restoration is just stunning; this is probably the best-looking b-movie from this era that I've ever seen, crystal clear and sharp with good contrast and next to no dirt or scratches.  Great extras include the very weird 1934 short Tiger Men of Mars and a really nice half-hour audio lecture by Crabbe from 1974.  There's a short but informative history of the character, and two complete radio episodes from the early 1930s.

A must for those who are already serial fans; anybody dipping their toes into this form - very much an acquired taste I think - would be better off checking out FLASH GORDON, THE DRUMS OF FU MANCHU or THE PHANTOM first, or my personal favorite&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phantom-Empire/dp/B0011Z5NFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phantom Empire</a>&nbsp;As with most serials, I'd suggest watching it one or two episodes at a time, both because the repetetiveness can get a little tedious, and to preserve the cliffhanger feeling that is built into it.",1264550400,8,3647,5.021558872305141
3945097,4,B002KVSJ6O,"The restoration and quality of the picture is outstanding.  This is the best DVD version of Buck Rogers that has ever been and likely will ever be released.

3945098,5,B002KVSJ6O,"I'm not reviewing this classic serial (nor get into a Buck Rogers/Flash Gordon debate)...but offering a review of the 2 DVD set that I picked up yesterday out of curiosity as it was so inexpensive and I remember seeing many of these episodes as a youngster on Saturday morning tv. The main reason for my review is to say that these are NOT public domain garbage transfers but seemingly first generation prints right off the film and film that is in remarkably great shape! Of course the space crafts are easily identifiable as models but its part of the charm.

Not only are the episodes in great shape but this company has also added some bonus features including an audio history by Buster Crabbe (which they have put great video in support of)..and more, including a 10 minute history of Buck Rogers and several radio shows!

I can't imagine a better looking or more comprehensive set coming out so if this is something you are a fan of this would be the one to purchase.",1259625600,40,974,4.56
3945099,5,B002KVSJ6O,"I've watched three of the episodes so far. The picture quality is a HUGE improvement over the original VCI release which I found to be murky, dark and blurry at times. The remastered image of the new release blows the old one away by miles. It is consistently sharp and bright. The audio quality is also very good.

The 2 disc set also includes a bunch of extras including a brief history of Buck Rogers, an audio speech given by Buster Crabbe about his career, 2 radio episodes of Buck Rogers, and an old Buck Rogers short form the 30's with different actors.

If you enjoy this serial, this is well worth the upgrade.",1258761600,23,619,4.421052631578948

3945125,5,B002KVSJ6O,"Larry Buster Crabbe is at it again, now as Buck Rogers of the 25th Century!  Simple, basic, Art Deco'ish fun, if you like old time movie serials, or Buster, you  won't be disappointed.

Our family discovered recently the nifty entertainment of these old cliffhangers.  Good guy vs. bad guy, fist fights, adventure, budget but often interesting sets, these serials offer non-complicated action that our children love.  Here, the dapper, well built(Olympic Swimmer) and ever affable, Buster Crabbe plays Buck, frozen in time along with his young friend, Buddy, only to be discovered in the 25th century- now ruled by a despot, Killer Kane.

Having watched the immensely enjoyable, Flash Gordon series, this one was less popular with less imaginative sets and situations; however, it still delivers plenty of fun.  My kids think it's simply an imitation of Flash: Ming the Merciless=Killer Kane, Dale Arden=Wilma Deering, Professor Huer= Docter Zarkov, Buddy=?Happy(FG trip to Mars), Clay People= Zugs(less interesting), and spaceships that sound like noisy fans with spewing sparklers.

Only 12 chapters here, but the print overall is good.  Apparently, since the audience wasn't as enthralled with Buck Rogers as Flash, the producers gave up on it and returned with the next show being, FG Conquers the Universe.  I bet Killer Kane, I mean Ming returns as the villain.  (Killer Kane reminds me of a Spanish matador while Ming the Merciless, of Fu Manchu)

Buster Crabbe won an Olympic Gold Medal for swimming.  He married his college sweetheart, and seemed to really enjoy his roles.  His friendly, go to it attitude and enthusiam is quite appealing.

Get your popcorn and every Saturday night, gather the family together for Family Movie Night, and get ready for some swashbuckling good times with Buck, Wilma and Buddy.",1441411200,,1820,5.184931506849315
3945126,5,B002KVSJ6O,"""Buck Rogers"" is a 12-chapter Universal serial starring Buster Crabbe, released in 1939, based on the comic strip by Philip Nowlan and Dick Calkin.  The screenplay is by Norman S. Hall and Ray Trampe, and it was directed by Ford Beebe and Saul A. Goodkind.

On a trans-polar dirigible flight in 1938, Buck Rogers (Buster Crabbe) and Buddy Wade (Jackie Moran), son of the scientist (Wade Boteler) in charge of the expedition, crash in a storm and are buried in snow and ice, but owing to a gas on-board for such emergencies they go into suspended animation.  Rescued after 500 years by scouts from the ""Hidden City"" and briefed by their leader, Scientist-General Huer (C. Montague Shaw), Buck and Buddy, aided by Lieutenant Wilma Deering (Constance Moore) are soon flying a space ship to Saturn, a few hours away, to get help in their fight against the Earth's evil dictator, Killer Kane (Anthony Warde.)

Regardless of the relative merits of Buck Rogers vs. Flash Gordon, all of Buster Crabbe's space epics are entertaining.  The Buck Rogers serial most closely resembles ""Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars"" from the previous year, and recycles some of the sets, cast members and even the tunnel rail cars.  Realism is not attempted; the sets and space ships are more ""Art Deco,"" and the same is true of the plot.  Killer Kane is a ""super racketeer"" rather than the more-flamboyant Emperor Ming of the Flash Gordon serials, though it is just possible the character was supposed to resemble a real-world dictator of the time.  And there is a decided lack of women, both on the Earth and Saturn, with the only one present, Wilma Deering, disguised in a ""Hidden City"" uniform.  It's a shock when she finally removes her swim cap...that is, ""flight helmet"" in one of the later chapters.  With the spark-and-smoke spewing space ships, the special effects designers went to a lot of trouble to provide differences between the ""Hidden City"" and ""Killer Kane"" models, but they get all mixed up, sometimes getting switched in the same scene.  As many times as I've seen this serial, I still can't figure out exactly what's going on in the final ""spectacular air battle"" or just where the space ships from Saturn are supposed to be.  But it's all great fun given the right expectations, and with a day or so between chapters to clear out all that smoke.

VCI's ""70th Anniversary"" DVD edition, # 8570 (ASIN: B002KVSJ6O) is on two discs.  Like the other videos I've seen of this serial, the source is a reissue print from Filmcraft, this one of generally excellent quality, though with a couple minor ""jumps"" due to splices, many of which are likely present in all reissue prints.  A few places have been patched from inferior sources but while the image may go a little dim for a few seconds, or show uneven film development, these have been inserted smoothly and the video noise remains low.  Patching of the sound is more obvious.  Most of it is in Chapter Two, where the quality becomes ""tinny"" and a little distorted, though the dialogue can still be understood.  There is also a minor issue with the usual ""restoration cheat"" where the same cleaned-up set of credits is used on more than one chapter.  Here the credits are from chapters One and Ten with MPPDA certificate numbers 4653 and 4662, with and without the ""mug shots"" of the main cast, respectively.  Only the first three chapters should have the ""mug shots"" but VCI attached the Chapter One credits to Chapter Four.  But it is far more important that those tiny MPPDA numbers are nice and clear, along with the other small print and the rest of the picture.  The image is nice and sharp, well-framed and remarkably free of scratches and dirt.  The brightness is a bit excessive on the surface of Saturn, where the clouds are nearly washed out, but elsewhere there are many details evident that were gone in the murkiness of the earlier editions.  Overall this is a fine transfer, similar in quality to VCI's releases of the Green Hornet serials.

VCI has included a bunch of ""extra features"" including the hilarious 1934 promotional Buck Rogers film used at the Chicago ""Century of Progress"" expositon, presumably to help sell Buck Rogers model space ships and related products.  The production looks something less than professional quality, though the flight of the ""rocket ships"" is better than what Universal did in the serial.  Audio features include the initial two Buck Rogers radio programs from 1932, and a talk given by Buster Crabbe from 1972.  There's also a survey of Buster Crabbe's career narrated by Clifford Weimar and a 28 minute video from the 2009 Comic-Con panel on Buck Rogers.

An entertaining serial, an excellent transfer and a lot of good extra features; I have no trouble giving it a 5-star ""I Love It"" rating.",1438214400,4,4786,4.79537149817296

That resolution to the cliffhanger really bugged me, but this serial is still so good and entertaining that I can still enjoy it and recommend it.

I am a big fan of the old ""Flash Gordon"" serials, a big fan of Buster Crabbe, and a big fan of ""Buck Rogers in the 25th Century"", but until now I had never seen the original ""Buck Rogers"" serial. I finally decided to buy it, and I loved it.

The Plot:

In 1939 pilot Buck Rogers and his navigator Buddy Wade are piloting an air blimp when they are caught in a blizzard over the Arctic and crash land. They are frozen for 500 years until they are revived in the year 2440 to find the Earth in the clutches of the sinister tyrant Kane (also known as Killer Kane). Buck and Buddy join forces with a resistance movement lead by Dr. Huer and Lt. Wilma Deering. Enlisting help from the planet Saturn, Buck and his comrades set out to overthrow Kane and save the Earth as well as the rest of the universe from his tyranny.

A good action-packed sci-fi oldie that I highly recommend!",1380326400,,1415,4.3283018867924525

3945154,5,B002KVSJ6O,"I bought this edition of the 1939 Universal Buck Rogers for the great extras that are included in this release.

First a word or two about the serial itself.  Over the years this serial has taken a lot of knocks because many consider it to be not up to the standards set by Universal's earlier 2 Flash Gordon serials.  But to my mind while not up to the levels achieved by 1936's Flash Gordon (few serials come any where close to that epic) Buck Rogers is still an above averaged serial offering plenty of entertainment for your bucks (pun intended).  Crabbe plays Buck in much the same manner that he did Flash Gordon which is not a bad thing.  The rest of the actors are all OK in their parts.  Because the comic strip was ten years old at the time this serial was released and the story line and focus had really changed over the years this film is not as faithful an adaption as Flash Gordon was. But as s a fan of the original comic strip (no I was not around in 1929 when the strip first appeared or 1939 when this serial was first released) I enjoyed seeing so many of its players (Wilma Dearing, Buddy rewritten considerably here, Dr. Huer, Killer Kane and even Prince Tallen of Saturn brought to life.  The serial has often been knocked because Anthony Warde's Killer Kane is so badly written but to me the film's ending has always been its weak spot.  It promises a space battle but fails to show it. The film print seems to be of the same quality of the earlier DVD release yet better than the old VSH tape release.  Common to all three releases is the lack of the Universal logo.  The film is credited to some company called Filmcraft.  I know there has to be some logical explanation for this and I wish someone would let me known.

The main reason I bought this film for the third time is the inclusion of the short (10 minutes in length) film 1933/34 Buck Rogers: An Interplanetary Battle With the Tiger Men of Mars.  I've read about this film for years, actually saw it finally on YouTube but this was the first time I have been able to add it to my Buck Rogers collection.  First shown as a part of a World's Fair exhibit in was later shown in department stores to promote the sell of Buck Rogers toys (Note:  Many Buck Rogers site mention this film and another short film shown in department stores but there was only this film used for both the World's Fair and later the department store promotion) this little wonder is about the most faithful adaption of Buck Rogers ever attempted.  Produced by John Flint Dille and starring his son it tells of a battle narrated by Dr. Huer (played by the film's director in a bad skull cap) between the Earth space fleet led by Buck Rogers and Wilma Deering (played by the actor playing Buck wife) the Martian fleet led by Killer Kane and Ardella in her only film appearance until the 1970's.  If the film lack a lot in in the acting and production department it makes up for it in the action department.  The space battle designed to display toy rockets for sale takes up much of the film's running time and is kinda' fun to watch.

The other extras included in this release include a fun if a bit short History of Buck Rogers, an interview with the late great Buster Crabbe, a video of Gil Gerard and Erin Grey the stars of the 70's film and TV series and the opening 2 episodes of the long running Buck Roger's radio series.  For the price what more could a Buck Rogers fan ask for.",1376524800,3,3443,4.333333333333333

3945156,5,B002KVSJ6O,I remember watching this with my father on Saturdays. Great classic!!!! My great Grandmother always talked about Buster Crabb. She always would talk how good looking he was! Lol,1371600000,2,177,5.137931034482759
3945157,4,B002KVSJ6O,"This was blast to watch. The special effects were - well - not too special. But to be to fair this was made more than 70 years ago with a shoestring budget. Since this is as much a fantasy as a Sci-Fi movie the special effects were more to move the story than be believable. From that point of view they are fine.

However from today viewpoint they distract from the story.

But I'm happy this has has been saved and I am able to see it. You have to, like most serials, get past some pretty stupid behavior. Now that I think about it many modern movies have the same problems - LOL!!! The henchmen are down right idiots and the main bad guy is only slightly smarter. However to be completely fair the good guys are not really any better.

The plot was sample and easy to follow. And the actors give it their all. Direction was acceptable but nothing special. Cinematography is basic (considering the term period shot) and effective.

But you have to have the right frame of mind to enjoy these. The picture was pretty good. The sound ranged from excellent to ok with the emphasis on excellent. I enjoyed this and would watch it again in a couple of years. When my daughter has kids I will be happy to share this with them.

It came very quick and was perfect shape. The price was really good with no sales tax (but there will be soon folks).

Overall I would rate this a very good 7.0 to 7.5 out of 10. I recommend this to anyone who likes old movies and serials in general.

If you like this type of thing they are, quite simply, a blast.",1370304000,,1539,4.2320819112627985

3945159,5,B002KVSJ6O,"That's probably the way someone would have described this thrill-packed adventure from 1939 that awaits you. The picture and sound quality are excellent and so are the evil villains, robot men, spaceships, aliens, futuristic weapons, matter transporters, anti-gravity belts, heroes and heroines. Have a whiff of nirvano gas, suspend your disbelief and leap ahead 500 years into the future with Buck Rogers!",1341532800,,406,5.564516129032258

8372263,5,B002KVSJ6O,"Buck Rogers in flying sparky ships.  Clouds in Outer Space.  Robot men with funny hats.  Secret bases. Cliff hanger endings, come back next week to see if Buck survives.  Space ships with doors and door knobs.  It]s a bit hooky, not very accurate Sifi.  I always liked Clouds in outer space.  Buster Crabbe played Tarzan, Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers.  For a serial the acting is not bad, the story is fun and the special effects are silly, but it works. The Episodes are fun to watch and since it is on DVD you don't have to wait until next Saturday to see how Buck survives.  Buck Rogers is not much different from Flash Gordon.  There are some who think that the Studio just changed the names added a back story for Buck and instead of a 5th Flash Gordon we got a Buck Rogers serial instead.  I had fun watching it.",1462060800,,818,4.315789473684211
