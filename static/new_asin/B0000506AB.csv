8411340,1,B0000506AB,"People should NOT BUY and boycott this film due to it's production company abusing the US labor laws and hiding in Hong Kong to escape several lawsuits. Myself and several Los Angeles actors worked on this film for many weeks and we NEVER got paid for our work. Myself and several other workers took this company to Calif Labor Board and won several judgements of several thousands of dollars against this outlaw Hong Kong film firm, It's almost impossible to get our monies from a company located in Hong Kong. The company only had a 'front person' show up to the labor board hearing from a local Asian Westminster Bank in SOCal to explain the scam it operated. The front person testified about the film company never paying anyone to shoot this film is SoCal. I know the film was completed and exhibited in the Far East and the USA. Dvds have been sold in Asain video store communities and the film made a profit. I have tried to find the DVD importer and distributer in San Francisco to attach a lien on this productions monies with my court judgement, but little is found that exhist on USA territory.
These producers are the worst kind of leeches and scum, DO NOT patronize their film by watching, exhibiting or buying their outlaw product. This is the worst of 'runaway' film production.",1354406400,,1293,4.626086956521739
