3445635,5,B001A5ES8Y,"this is how jerry jones makes his money, pimp out the cowboys any which way, thats why they are americas team, every where you look there are cowboys jerseys, pictures, books. this keeps them in the spot light. I just bought the super bowl collection and the complete history, it left me wanting more...cant wait for September!",1213142400,6,327,4.754385964912281
3445636,5,B001A5ES8Y,"Will this just include the History of the Dallas Cowboys from 2004 to 2008?  NFL Films just released a Complete History of the Dallas Cowboys, 1960 - 2003, back in 2003, so why release another one so soon?  Dallas hasn't won a Super Bowl, or been invited to play in one since the last Complete History, so what will this disk include?

As for the NFL Films Complete History Series, they have only released 12 titles to date.  That leaves 20 teams still without a Complete History DVD.  What about the Dolphins, Redskins, Vikings, Rams, Browns, Bills or Chargers?  Why revisit the Cowboys when all of these teams, and others, haven't had a Complete History produced yet?",1211760000,7,669,4.6752136752136755

3445652,5,B001A5ES8Y,"Got this for my son for Christmas. He said ""oh thanks"" and put it aside. Last night I hear, ""that video is amazing!"" and he tells me that the Cowboys DVD has ALL of the history, clips from the big rivalry games between Dallas-Pittsburgh back in the 70s and tons of information that he didn't know about his favorite team. He was very grateful and actually watched all of the discs all the way through. He thanked me again for the gift - this time enthusiastically. This was a very well put together video - something every Cowboys fan should own.",1389052800,4,546,4.415841584158416

3445657,5,B001A5ES8Y,"The best part of being a Cowboy's fan is the history of the team. Its amazing watching Dallas in their first year being given the three worst players from every team, and not even the luxury of a college draft pick. They then go from the worst team in the American Football League to the one of the greatest teams in NFL history in just a decade!",1345075200,3,346,4.17910447761194
3445658,5,B001A5ES8Y,The video arrived right on time for my boyfriend's birthday. He loved the video. It has a lot of great shots in it. Great video and great seller.,1316476800,,145,4.214285714285714
3445659,3,B001A5ES8Y,A very brief chronological history of the Dallas Cowboys.  Despite its brevity it did filled many gaps in my knowledge of this great team.  The DVD focussed a lot on Tom Landry and Roger Staubach.  It would have been good to spend more time on some of the other Cowboy greats.  Perhaps span the history over several DVDs.,1315440000,2,321,4.482758620689655
3445660,5,B001A5ES8Y,"Got this for my husband.  Truly enjoyed it since it covers the team history well..second DVD gives highlights of 1980 division playoff game, and has great extra content too; including a interview with The Triplets!!",1297814400,4,215,5.142857142857143
3445661,5,B001A5ES8Y,I gave this DVD as a gift to my future brother-in-law for X-Mas.  As soon as he opened it he was thrilled and couldn't wait to go home to watch it.  He is a die hard Dallas fan so I think this is a great gift.,1295222400,3,209,3.5217391304347827
3445662,5,B001A5ES8Y,"Bought this awesome item for my 7 year old son who is fascinated by Deion Saunders (from watching his lickety-split moves on youtube) and wanted to learn more about the Cowboys...although we live in SF! ;/  (Yes, we get duff from our Raider and 49er neighbors!!!) Oh well!!

HE LOVED IT! We have learned a lot about the Cowboys and their awesome climb...from their rocky start to the Superbowl years, about Tom Landry and we picked up the names of some heavy hitters from over the years.

I must admit I was never a football fan until my son expressed interest...NOW I AM!

This opened my eyes to the dynamics and thrill of the game!!!

Pssst...Hey guys, buy this for your girl/guy and let them fall in love with the excitement of football...

In summary:  WE LOVE IT! Great, informative and very exciting watch! You will walk away from this with a love for the game and a lot of interesting knowledge!",1259193600,6,902,4.530864197530864
3445663,4,B001A5ES8Y,"It's interesting how this video covers the history of the Cowboys. I like the stuff on the 60's teams, especially with Lilly, Meredith and Garrison. What is problematic is in disc 2 where it has the game where Dallas came back to win at Atlanta, that they omit the fact that the Cowboys lost to the Rams the year before (1979) and to the Eagles in the 1980 NFC title game. If White was a great quarterback, he would have found a way to win the Eagles game.",1251158400,,456,4.193181818181818
