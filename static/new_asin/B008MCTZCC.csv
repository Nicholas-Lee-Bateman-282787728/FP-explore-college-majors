8528917,5,B008MCTZCC,It's not too often that something hits a home run on multiple levels.  This show not only captures the subtleties of this era perfectly it does it in a way that makes you laugh and rock out at the same time!  Highly recommended buy!,1371772800,,232,4.25
8528918,5,B008MCTZCC,Great job on the DVD and packaging. The bonus music videos were great and the whole package was very professional. I had only seen clips of some of the episodes previously and was really glad to see the whole thing. I can't wait for Season 2!,1343174400,,242,4.282608695652174
