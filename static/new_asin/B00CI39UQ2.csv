8581930,5,B00CI39UQ2,"I loved Eureka, so I was very happy to find the complete series for a great price. Just pay attention to the description of this boxed set... The DVDs are region 2, meaning they won't play in a regular US DVD player. Too many people bought these without reading carefully, then they gave a bad review because they didn't have the right player. If you have a DVD player that is hacked to play all regioins or if you have a multi-region DVD player, these will play perfectly!

This set contains all five seasons plus a lot of bonus material. It also comes in a nice case. I love it!",1493596800,6,580,4.2727272727272725

8581933,5,B00CI39UQ2,"I ordered this product because I loved the TV show when it was on and the price could not be beat. I know that it is not for a US region but it is actually really easy to turn most DVD players into a region free DVD player lots of safe and easy to find sights to help you. Blu-Ray players are a little harder but not imposable. I highly recommend this DVD set to any one that likes Sci Fi and comedy, it's the perfect blend.",1482624000,6,424,3.8850574712643677
