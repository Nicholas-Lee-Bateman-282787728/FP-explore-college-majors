8433229,1,B000CNF98I,"I am a diehard EWF fan, and curious, I bought this DVD. It is in fact a compilation of performances, kind of like a 'best of' CD, except all of these performances are available on the other DVDs. There are a few from the Montreux DVD, the Live (1994) DVD, the In Concert 81 DVD, and the Greek Theatre DVD. Nothing new here. Unless you don't want a full concert and just want to see some good clips from already available items, don't buy this, the description is misleading.",1165449600,3,474,4.337078651685394
