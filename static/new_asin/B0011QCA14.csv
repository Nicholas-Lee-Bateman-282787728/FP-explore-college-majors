8242089,3,B0011QCA14,"This quality of the digital transfer was a bit sub-par. My copy was simply a poor transfer and it as distracting, at times, to see pixels flashing around the screen while trying to read the subtitles. The storyline was reasonably entertaining. I found the story a tad flat.",1274054400,,273,4.708333333333333
