8017611,4,B0001XAK9M,This movies could of been made better it is a good movie but not Jimmy's Wang Yu best performance. He plays in some great movies but this one could of been a little bit more interesting.,1425081600,,186,4.194444444444445

8017613,5,B0001XAK9M,"You need to know what you're getting into. This has nothing to do with Shaws--it's cheap Taiwanese late 70s exploitation at its most absurd and mean-spirited, more or less in the same camp as Master of the Flying Guillotine, just without that film's inexplicable cult status. It's got 6 foot long styrofoam swords, a hermaphrodite monk who speaks in both a male and female voice, a bad guy who communicates to his henchmen from another room through a cardboard megaphone setup, and... probably some other stuff I'm forgetting. All the humor is derived from the film's bad dubbing and general incompetence--the fact it's supposed to be a grim, deadpan action movie makes it a lot more funny and surreal than it has any right to be.

Bootleg, beyond atrocious video/audio, and probably missing scenes, but good luck finding a better version. I'm just glad not all of this cheap, ridiculous curio is lost to the ages.",1344384000,,914,4.858974358974359
8017614,1,B0001XAK9M,"WARNING!! If it's not distrubuted by Celestial Pictures,(the company that legally owns THE ENTIRE SHAW BROTHERS MOVIE CATALOG), DO NOT BUY. If you want good remasterd Shaw Brothers movies from Amazon, I recommend the movies from Image Entertainment and Dragon Dynasty. At least they did acquire the rights from Celestial to release their movies in the proper way. So to all you Shaw Brothers movie buffs like myself, take heed to this.",1203465600,,435,5.055555555555555
8017615,3,B0001XAK9M,"...the ending receives all the stars- WOW!  otherwise this is a bit lower than average Kung fu film, and I am a Jimmy Wang Yu fan.  The fight scenes are below average for the most part and only the last 25 minutes of the film are worth watching.  This movie shows that comic relief is necessary in any good story (ask Shakespear.... actually a William S. Kung Fu movie would be a good idea... Macbeth has a pretty good plot for it!).  Better one-armed boxing appears in the Master of the Flying Guillotine (spelling?).",1123113600,,518,4.4787234042553195
8017616,1,B0001XAK9M,"WHY, for the love of god?! You know, this might be hard for mainstream movie audiences to understand, but some of us would actually appreciate classy packaging and a quality DVD transfer on a kung-fu flick every once in a while. Unfortunately, those of you looking for what I just described will have to look elsewhere.
I was aware when I bought the film that it wasn't an entry in Wang Yu's ""One-Armed Swordsman"" series, and I didn't mind that. This is actually ""One-Armed Against Nine Killers"", a little-seen film from the midseventies that I've been trying to track down for years. What I DON'T appreciate is the fact that Videoasia completely hacked the credits off the beginning of the movie. I'm not thrilled with the condition of the print, either; it's very obviously a direct copy of a shaky, blurry old VHS tape with tracking lines running through it more than once. TRACKING LINES, FOR GOD'S SAKE. Some of the fights are watchable, but the film looks like (...)t overall.
Kung-fu movie fans shouldn't have to put up with this kind of incompetence and carelessness in the DVD age. We paid our dues with all those cheap videotapes in the eighties, remember? There must be some company out there that's willing to spend a little cash and give these films a decent release. As for Videoasia(which should be put out of business): shoddy work, you ripoff artists. I won't be buying anything else with your name on it. Why not aim a little lower and retitle the movie ""One-Armed Swordzman Vs. Nine Killaz, Biatch""? You might sell it to three or four more unlucky people.
NO STARS.",1120867200,5,1584,4.701438848920863
8017617,3,B0001XAK9M,"Although there are no One Armed Swordsmen, there is only one One

Armed Boxer, the movie is still not bad! The movie is actually

called One Armed vs. 9 Killers which would make since, but I

guess Video Asia changed the name to get dumb-asses like us to

buy these films! The picture quality is watchable, but there are

scenes in the movie to where the screen will start boncing up

and down and it's annoying! But that only occurs like 7 times

and usual they appear whenever the camera takes a picture of the

sky for some dumb ass reason! Other than that, this is a walk in

the park kung fu flick with Jimmy Wang Yu style brutal fights

and slow moving story!",1115942400,,665,4.248
8017618,2,B0001XAK9M,"First of all, I love all the one armed swordsman series with Jimmy Wang Yu but this film is both deceitful on it's cover and title, and the reason being the following: The Cover shows the old legendary One Armed Swordsman (I believe the picture is from part 2 of the series), in this movie Jimmy Wang Yu plays a one armed fighter, nothing to do with the original legendary swordsman since not even once does he uses his cutoff trademark sword or any sword at all, it's more like the chinese boxer but with an awful twist at the end. It should be renamed appropriately ""The One Armed Fighter..."" not at all what I expected this movie to be. Hence, the rating on this movie but if you are really a hard-core Jimmy Wang Yu fan and don't mind the comment, you might want to consider buying it.",1104105600,4,789,4.302013422818792
