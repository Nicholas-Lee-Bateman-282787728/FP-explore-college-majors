8751912,4,B01BXVE5G4,"I ordered this because it has 2 Stan Laurel shorts I didn't have.  Imagine my surprise when I watched the 6 shorts and found them all very good.  One of them features terrific, hilarious bit of many people sliding & falling on soapy floors.  Roughest Africa has amazing scenes with real live animals (a bear, an ostrich and lions) that are mostly NOT special effects - it is obvious that the lead actors were physically present with the animals.  This set is a terrific deal - at an amazing price - for fans of silent comedies.  The film quality is okay, very watchable.",1459296000,,570,4.495145631067961
