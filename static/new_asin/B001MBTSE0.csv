8320967,5,B001MBTSE0,"A spritely, and perhaps spirited, review of the merits of the Vietnam War, or, more specifically, what course of action to take, and what justifies that action.  Buckley crosses sabers with the very cantankerous Norman Thomas who, like many of the political left at the time, equated the ideology of communism with the tenets of democracy, and thus, like the commoner who was allured by the promise of egalitarianism and a fair share of other's wealth, bought into what was promised by both socialism and communism alike.

I call this episode spritely because one wonders how seriously the words from Thomas were taken by the audience.  He claimed pacifism and the nobility that comes with it, but was combative in tone, and did not successfully make his points about what war was justifiable, and means of war were criminal.  He further seemed to attempt to lay upon mister Buckley that somehow the host of the show was a war monger, which Buckley quickly eschewed for the audience.

Thomas reminds me of the kind of American who believes that his own heartfelt values weigh and are congruent with the false promises of socialism and communism.  One can see that right off, and, were you like me, you would have experienced it day in and day out with the so-called moderate peace movement that married various facets of intellectuals and intellectualism into a, as Thomas might call it, ""kill with kindness"" juggernaut.

Unlike my other reviews I won't dabble further into the merits of either side of the argument.  You should be able to discern my position from my words here.  I will, however, suggest that in order to really understand the context of this debate, a person has to be familiar with the Cold War in total.  A thing which I'm not sure that future people, who may come across my review, will be familiar with, or, if they have knowledge, will not understand the scope and scale of the Cold War and the stakes at hand.  Once you know that, then I think one ca rightfully watch this episode and thus make their judgment on who was right and who was wrong; i.e. the merits of Buckley and Thomas.

Having said that, I will side with Buckley in that Thomas failed to demonstrate that he had any charm.",1420588800,,2213,4.675257731958763
8320968,4,B001MBTSE0,"I became interested in this episode when I saw Lewis Black of all people mention Norman Thomas on Morning Joe, and realized there was a bit a gap in my political awareness.  Mika Brezhinski didn't know who he was, either, but then cable news isn't a knowledge based industry.  Reading about Mr. Thomas in Wikepedia, I learned about his very impressive career as an anti-war activist dating back to America's entry into World War I, his six time candidacy as the Socialist party nominee for the Presidency of the United States, and the fact that he was the very first guest ever to appear on Firing Line, which debuted in 1966.  Also of interest, he is one of Evan Thomas's grandfathers, and you can pick up similarities in mannerism between them.  Here's the thing about this episode, it's quite obvious Mr. Buckley is a bit over-prepared, far more snide and condescending than usual, even for him, and yet Norman Thomas gets the better of the argument in the end, I believe.  The subject is escalation of the war in Vietnam, it's two years before Johnson throws in the towel, and Mr. Thomas easily refutes Buckley's assertions about Norman Thomas' positions concerning WWII and Korea, which Buckley asserts, falsely from what I've read, as a device to cast Mr. Thomas as an appeaser on all fronts.  But, it was Buckley's first episode, and he improves, as Mr. Thomas, with age.  I do recommend it for people lived through the sixties as a refresher on where we really were back then, and for younger people who want to consult contemporary sources to appreciate what we dealt with in those times.  It's quite funny though when Buckley points out in his arch, nasally fashion, that ""people told me that if I voted for Barry Goldwater the war in Vietnam would escalate, I did, and it did.""  A voter today might say, ""people told me that if I voted for Mitt Romney we'd have problems with Russia, I did, and we do.""  A very clever performance, and in the end Buckley is rather gracious toward his guest, in his way.",1399680000,,2013,4.629213483146067
8320969,5,B001MBTSE0,During the brief moments when Norman Thomas is not pontificating whimsical platitudes Buckley elucidates the utter puerility involved in the argumentation of Thomas. For some reason Thomas has beguiled himself into believing that voting for totalitarianism is somehow equivalent to self-determinism (even though such a premise is antithetical to itself). Of course by the end Thomas was just as befuddled as in the beginning having grasped very little of what Buckley had said.,1262131200,3,477,5.5479452054794525
8320970,5,B001MBTSE0,"Although I had missed this episode initially, by reputation, deservedly so, I had to re-visit this beloved, wise pacifist Norman Thomas and have a good listen. I was rewarded. Had this nation listened to Mr. Thomas and paused bombing long enough back in 1965, we would have ended the Vietnam ""conflict"" long before it became the commercial war that was lost. Unlike other shows, Mr. Buckley uncharacteristically misbehaved throughout this discussion with ad hominem attacks upon the alleged reputation of this war dissident that he graciously absorbed and quickly rebutted, to again and again, get Mr. Buckley back to the point of discussion: why the war cannot be won. Mr. Thomas survives the hawkish Buckley sniping with grace and charm, although Mr. Buckley thinks otherwise in his closing remarks. This is one encounter that Mr. Buckley did not learn from, nor did our country. There is something to say about the manliness of listening that only the old warriors like Norman Thomas embodied so completely. I consider this show an important document of our tone deafness about the Vietnam War.",1238025600,4,1097,5.1
