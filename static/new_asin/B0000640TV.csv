7960002,5,B0000640TV,"This video has everything you ever wanted to know (and then some) about beetles and spiders. Each gets more than 30 minutes of in-depth explanation on all aspects of its life cycle. The video also looks at several types of spiders and beetles, not just one or two, and clearly explains the differences. The species discussed are primarily from Africa. The videography is excellent, and the narrative very clear, despite the narrator's having a distinct British accent. The intended audience for this video is adults, but my two- and four- year olds were mesmerized by it. They now curl up on the couch together and say, ""Spiders, please!"" With the wealth of scientific content in this video, I am happy to accommodate them and turn it on!",1349827200,4,738,4.818897637795276
7960003,5,B0000640TV,"Like ""Animals in the Wild"" this DVD is very good.  The only better works are those BBC ""The life of Mammals"" and ""The life of Birds"" but if your a wildlife lover than these DVDs belong in your collection.
  The Wildlife Stories series consist of three DVDs - each DVD dedicated to two animals each.  In this case spiders and beetles.  Great closeup footages, lots of indepth info make this DVD very interesing.  Compared to the only other DVD about insects ""Insectia"" this is ten times a better purchase.",1061596800,26,504,4.606741573033708
