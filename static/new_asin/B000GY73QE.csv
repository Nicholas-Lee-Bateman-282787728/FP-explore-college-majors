2620439,5,B000GY73QE,"The long awaited Live In Tavastia DVD concert has finally been released in the USA.  As always the 69 Eyes put on a very good show on this dvd.  IN response to the review of  "" The Truth Hurts""  Yes there was a problem with this batch of DVDS.  I called Cleopatria Records and they have acknowledged this and are investigating it.  I got mine at Best Buy and with the exception of the interview selection it plays fine.  Highly reccommended",1160006400,,440,4.3580246913580245
2620440,1,B000GY73QE,"dont buy this DVD! the pressing is defective and doesn't play on 95% of dvd players. Amazon also told me: ''We are sorry that your replacement shipments were also problematic. As it seems that the problem with this item is more widespread than we originally thought, we are not able to send another replacement. We will investigate and remedy the situation with the item. We will gladly refund you in full for the return of this item.''

i don't know how the other reviewer could claim they have this DVD when none of them play correctly. there is a European version that's been released for about 3 years already, so maybe that's what the other reviewer was recalling... but THIS U.S. VERSION IS DEFECTIVE!

*****UPDATE*****
the company that manufactured this DVD has sent out replacements, and the word on the 'street' is that the PLAYBACK problem has been fixed 100% and they all work on all DVD players... but, the ANAMORPHIC SQUEEZE problem is still there.",1159920000,4,961,4.783132530120482
2620441,5,B000GY73QE,"'Helsinki Vampires' DVD includes a stunning live performance from 69 Eyes recorded live at the Tavastia, Finland in November 2002. This DVD also includes all the produced 69 Eyes video tracks (pre. ""Devils"" album) plus extra material. The short clip where Jyrki69 explains how to pronounce his name is my favourite bonus feature.
The 69 Eyes is the greatest Goth/Rock band of our time, and this DVD will rock your socks off!  If you are new to tunes from The 69 Eyes, then this DVD is a great introduction to the dark and rocking world of the Helsinki vampires.
This DVD is one of the best music DVD's I've ever seen, and believe me I have seen many, but I hardly ever remove the Helsinki Vampires DVD from my player (YES, it's that good!!!!)

8135041,1,B000GY73QE,"I ordered this DVD for a friend who is a fan of the 69 eyes. The day after I handed her the DVD she called me (august 2011) and told me that the DVD does not work in either of her 2 DVD players. She gave it back to me and I tried it in my Laptop where it also does not work. Reading the reviews after the fact this seems to be a problem that has been occoring since the DVD was released in 2006.
I contacted Amazon about the problem by e-mail and received a very fast response and refund.
A note to Amazon to maybe not sell the obviously defective item any more.

8135042,5,B000GY73QE,"this right here is a very amazing DVD. if you don't have a good sound system on your TV, watch it on your computer with the speakers cranked. the live show is very awesome and the videos are fun as well. another fun thing is the interviews with the then ""vampires"". however, you must have to push on Jussi to hear all of them talk. if you dont, you will miss Jussi speaking, which has the lowest voice of them all. the reason why i wrote the title to this is because this was their last awesome cd as well as last awesome tour. when they ""crept"" to America, everything changed. get this DVD to experience what true ""goth n' roll"" was like and you won't be disappointed. do not, get the cd/dvd for the combo of Angels/Devils, its a waste. if you do decide to get it, you will understand what im saying.",1267660800,,801,4.207792207792208
8135043,5,B000GY73QE,"i was very happy with this dvd, i first ordered it through netflix and decided it was worth buying so of course came to amazon for a great deal, no more than $6 i paid for it all up.

excellent music, great voices, i really enjoyed all of it so much id watch it over and over again.",1233532800,,282,3.8620689655172415

8135045,5,B000GY73QE,"For those of you having a problem with the US release, try playing it on something other than a DVD player (PS2 works).  I have the original release (ordered it from Finland, a long time ago; it was delivered faster than some other CD's and DVD's I ordered from an import place in LA - and I live in California!) and the original is flawless.  These guys never screw up - we've seen them live twice now and they are awesome!  I would rather listen to them than to my other favorites - including AFI, Trivium, Aiden, HIM, Atreyu, Dir en Grey, etc. etc.  The DVD is all pre-""Devils"" music but shows their unsurpassed ability to excel live; it's worth it to keep trying until you get a copy that works!",1173830400,2,699,4.312977099236641
