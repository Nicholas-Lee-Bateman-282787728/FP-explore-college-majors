Walt always gets credit for being the first... but the reality is quite different.  For example Arto Monoco created his own theme park in upstate New York nearly 10 years BEFORE Disney, and Art's layout is the same circular hub layout that Walt used right down to the Castle at the end of main street.  No one loves Walt and Disneyland more than me, but NO MAN is a born genius.

A life of success is the ability to observe what others do, and either improve upon it, or branch out from that person's ideas as a base for your own thoughts.  If you understand this to be fact, then it is important to saturate yourself with ideas and concepts from others that came before you.  This DVD is a great little piece of history, worth owning especially if you are 'searching for the magic'.",1367884800,,974,4.443820224719101
