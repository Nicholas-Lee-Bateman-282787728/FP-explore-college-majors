8118217,1,B000F6ZCGQ,"This badly produced DVD barely skims the surface of Holliday's life. You cannot delve too deeply in a 50 minute program; but you can try. The makers of this program barely did that. Many of the supposed facts are inaccurate. This program says he left Georgia breaking off his engagement to his first cousin, Mattie. There is no evidence they were engaged. The re-enactments are poorly done. All in all, just a poorly made film.

Take the money you would have spent on this and buy a good book biography instead.",1176681600,25,511,4.615384615384615
