8016718,3,B0001VKJFO,"On August 8 1963, Ronnie Biggs, Buster Edwards and a gang of 20 or so men and women robbed a night train just outside Cheddington in rural Buckinghamshire.

 They escaped with ?2.3 million in used bank notes but were later captured and jailed for a total of 307 years between them.

 Biggs later escaped from a London prison in 1965 after serving 15 months of a 30-year sentence.

 He fled first to Australia, ended up in Rio and, after marrying a local woman and fathering a child, could not be extradited under Brazilian law.

 Great story for a movie, right?

 However, PRISONER OF RIO covers the most interesting parts of the above story in a fast-paced ""documentary"" sequence spanning the first five minutes of the movie. Before the title of the film even shows up on the screen, the robbery, the prison break, and the escape to Brazil is already covered. This movie is a dramatized account of Biggs' day-to-day life in Rio. (Note: this film is in English - there are no subtitles, as stated in the description.)

 The film follows the adventures of a inept agent of Scotland Yard, assigned to bring Biggs back to England. His schemes don't seem very well thought out. And the movie ends up becoming more of a travelogue of Rio, than anything else.

 Paul Freeman (best known as Belloq, the French archaelogist in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK) plays Biggs, who acts as our lively tour guide to the great party atmosphere of carnival season in Rio - a city where crime and shady characters are rampant.

 The fact that the movie was shot on location in Rio, and that Ronald Biggs is credited as one of the screenwriters, are probably the film's strongest assets. My biggest complaint is that it barely covers the Great Train Robbery at all.

 You may also wish to check out BUSTER, starring Phil Collins, based on the life of Buster Edwards. Another member of the Great Train Robbery gang. That film similarly concentrates on Buster's day-to-day life after the famed crime took place.",1090368000,3,1983,4.665706051873199
