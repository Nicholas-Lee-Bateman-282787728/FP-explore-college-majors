1825846,5,B0000844IC,"This historical fantasy was very entertaining, educating me on the life of the author while evoking, in a more profound manner, a recollection of stories told to me as a child.  I recommend it for the family who wants to enjoy a fun, memorable movie together.",1357603200,,259,4.630434782608695
1825847,2,B0000844IC,"The reason I gave it a two was that I got the right case but got the wrong movie.  When we opened the case which was the correct one, there was an english movie  Ladies in Lavendar.  Since I love that movie I am keeping it.  I will have to try again after Christmas for the Hans Christian Anderson one.  My grandson is waiting to watch it. He is 16 and I am so happy he got into the movie when we watched it on tv.  We just didn't know that it was a 2 parter.  The movie came at a fast pace.  Was not disapointed on that account.",1260576000,2,529,3.7889908256880735
1825848,5,B0000844IC,"This is a brilliant movie. I have watched it many times and I cried every time. It tells the life of Hans Christian Andersen, while slipping beautifully into the stories he wrote. The genius part is the way that the SAME actors and actresses are used in the ""real life"" part as well as the fairytales. This really helped to show the symbolism of the story, seeing it perhaps as Andersen saw them. It has wonderful costumes and beautiful singing. It also shows, very gently at first but later far more ""in-your-face"" Andersen's slip into insanity.",1181865600,4,546,4.697916666666667
1825849,2,B0000844IC,"I ordered this movie as research for a graduate project dealing with the way artists are portrayed by the film industry. I expected that, as a Hallmark production, it would be an enjoyable movie based on facts. I was disappointed on both counts.

My problems arise mostly from the way the main character was portrayed. Hans Christian Anderson, according to most documentation, was a homely, shy, naive man with an active imagination and a gift for storytelling. This movie presented him as a handsome, frenetic fool with an active imagination and a gift for storytelling.

The moviemakers took great liberties with both the timeline and with the facts of Anderson's life, and rewrote his fairy tales - again. The ones that he actually wrote were more concerned with presenting a moral lesson than a happy ending. For instance: The popular modern version of ""Hans Christian Anderson's The Little Mermaid"" is a search-for-true-love, happily-ever-after children's story. This movie's version is a love-at-first-sight, kill-him-when-he-betrays-you slice of contemporary urban behavior. Anderson's original tale was concerned as much with the search for an immortal soul as it was with selfless love, in which the mermaid dies rather than kill her love - who DID marry the other woman - and thus attained the soul that she longed for.

On the good side, the acting was good, the sets and costumes and lighting were pretty wonderful. The way that Anderson's imagination was shown turning everyday events into full-blown stories - his creative process - was very well done.

Still, overall, I expected far better from a Hallmark film.",1171065600,4,1627,5.17490494296578
1825850,4,B0000844IC,"I take David Eberhart's point about the depressing quality that weaves its way though this movie - the front end, during his early years, being the most depressing by far.

The almost Shakespearean tragedy of mis-placed affection and obsessive love that led Andersen to pursue the wrong woman is captured well, while various fairytales are woven into the real-life a story span.

Bew is almost over the top as a wacky but gifted Andersen, although his craziness gradually diminishes as the movie progresses.

Emily Hamilton gives a heartbreakingly sweet and sensitive performance as his 'adoptive' sister, whom any man in his right mind would have married in an instant.

By the time Andersen works out that he really loved Emily's character after all, it is too late...

When it works, it works beautifully, and the cast, which includes the superb James Fox and Alison Steadman (who turns in a couple of delicious cameos) all delivered admirable performances.

Not perfect, but worth a look.",1157587200,9,992,5.0552147239263805
1825851,5,B0000844IC,This version of Hans Christian Andersen is really great.  Wonderful costumes scenery and good actors and also scenery and effects.  Its version for children and grownups .,1082937600,11,171,5.296296296296297
1825852,5,B0000844IC,"Kieran Bew and Emily Hamilton bring most of the emotional and acting highs to this delightful production.

The art direction and styling of this splendrous melding of Hans Christian Andersen and his memorable stories are unforgettable.

Bew brings a delightfully childlike and charmingly bubbly prescence that disarms one and allows us into the mind and true story of one of history's delightful creations.

I recommend this very highly. To those who cherish Andersen and those have not been spoiled by this present world of in-your-face theatrics and slam-bang storytelling. All is not happy in this tale.  But that's life...as Hans readily admits.

The pace is free and easy.  Buy it, make yourself a cup of tea and sit back. Enjoy.",1075680000,11,734,5.075
1825853,1,B0000844IC,"This film is horribly depressing.  The main actor plays his character like a raving lunatic and , if he acted this way in public, would have been locked up.
  I was hoping this DVD would be a series of shorts, like arabian nights, or even the 10th kingdom, but no.  Instead it was a thinly disguised biography of han's christian anderson.  In fact the acting of the main character is so bad, you do not even want to see the fairy tales.  They too are gloomy and depressive.
  Skip this one, and if you must get a hall mark faerie tale try the following:
  10th Kingdom
  Arabian nights
  The Snow Queen
  Dinotopia
  Jack and the Bean Stalk the true story
  Merlin
In that order.
Sincerely:  David C. Eberhart II",1051488000,23,712,4.364341085271318

7978816,5,B0000844IC,"This movie has been my favourite since childhood. Sadly the disc we owned previously (though had it several years) is badly scratched and skips in several places, so I had to order a new one. The movie arrived in near perfect condition. (I noticed it skipped a tiny bit in one spot.)",1428105600,,283,4.461538461538462

7978819,5,B0000844IC,"This is a very nice movie with a beautiful production. This movie shows interesting facts like the visit of Hans Christian Andersen to Charles Dickens in London. It also shows scenes on Andersen's paper cuts. This is  a long movie with much fantasy, beautiful costumes and excellent performance.",1406073600,,295,5.145833333333333
7978820,5,B0000844IC,"Although not totally accurate, the film is a good introduction to the life of Hans Christian Andersen.  Based on an autobiography of the same name, the film guides the viewers through the challenges encountered by Andersen throughout his life.  It helps those interested in his work to see parallels between his life and fairytales.",1399939200,,332,5.12962962962963
7978821,5,B0000844IC,Excellent and very good effects. So sad Yetta had to die before Hans came to the realization that  he really did love her and that his infactuation with Jenny Lind would come to nothing. My heart went out to Yetta and her father was terrific.,1399852800,,242,4.377777777777778
7978822,4,B0000844IC,"This is a movie I have loved since the first time I saw it years ago. It is truly a creative gem which sticks with you for years. It is a fun and fantastic journey through a fact-based story of Hans Christian Andersen's life, delightfully punctuated with excerpts from many of his most beloved fairy tales. It is a great family movie and I would certainly recommend it to any Andersen fan.",1382313600,,389,4.416666666666667
