He's very artistic and unique, you have to see for yourself , the guy knows how to sing and write a song, uk is lucky, he's stopped touring the u.s., sadly for over a decade",1402531200,2,268,3.890909090909091
4193262,5,B003U0AHCI,"Parents don't have the option of the Baby TV channel, which I do.  Grandson really enjoys watching all of the colorful shapes and critters so bought this DVD for him when he's at home.",1377302400,,184,4.411764705882353
4193263,3,B003U0AHCI,Was a bit disappointed it did not have the more common nursery rhymes that my 14 month enjoys. He still enjoys the DVD though,1377216000,,125,4.25
4193264,2,B003U0AHCI,It looks and sounds very different from Baby TV on youtube. I would not recommend it. It does not have the beautiful colors.,1377129600,,124,4.434782608695652

4193268,5,B003U0AHCI,"I love this product but, IT IS NOT ALL REGION!!!
IT""S ONLY PAL!!!
You can only play this on your PC if you don't have an all region or PAL dvd player.
Amazon needs to make the change it to PAL.Right now it's false advertising...",1369353600,5,228,4.088888888888889
4193269,5,B003U0AHCI,"I love the product,but the seller is false advertising it as an all region product. It is not. It is only PAL.
Te only way I can play it is through my PC.This sucks. I'd like to beable to play it on my home dvd player/playstation 3.
The only reason why I'm not returning it is because it was cheap and I'm a huge robbie williams fan. So I can bare with it.
The really needs to change it to a PAL only product.",1369353600,,409,3.880952380952381
4193283,1,B003U0AHCI,"The description says Region ""0"" which means that it suppose to play in ANY/ALL regional machine; however, I bought this to play in my multiregional DVD player (which just died) & popped it into my standard Region 1 DVD (NTSC/NorthAmerican) player.  The disk does NOT work!  Therefore, this is a Region 2 or PALS/European disk & is NOT a Multi-Region or Region 0 disk as listed!

4193284,4,B003U0AHCI,"Was a fabulous 2 disc set!!!! all vids look wonderful. Only lost a star due to the exclusion for a couple of videos but probably due to copyright issues and I'm nit exactly sure which ones just know there are a couple left out.

Sounds and looks great BUY IT!!!!!",1353801600,,263,4.26
4193289,1,B003U0AHCI,"I feel somewhat bad giving this a low rating, because the content is good, but the DVD is so poorly made that I can't give it anything higher than one star.

NINE of the videos are in MONO! All the 4x3 videos are pillarboxed to 16x9 - ok, this helps with making the disc easier to author, but results in lower resolution. The menus are basic beyond belief, there are no special features whatsoever, all in all a really disappointing DVD.

Epic fail by Metropolis Group I'd say.",1294617600,4,477,4.409090909090909
8405571,5,B003U0AHCI,I actually found Robbie Williams on YouTube about three years ago. I have watched a lot of his concert(s) footage and found myself  enjoying song after song! Robbie Williams is the total package of a pop music icon. In and Out of Consciousness has all of the songs I love plus additional songs Ithat I was not aware of.  It's easy to see why he has so many fans today who still love his music.,1493596800,,393,4.226666666666667
