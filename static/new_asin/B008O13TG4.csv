5171418,5,B008O13TG4,"One of my favorite TV shows ever, in a wonderful boxed set!

When I saw that ""Desperate Housewives"" was coming in a boxed set format, I immediately sold my 7 individual sets on Eb@y and pre-ordered this set. I am SO glad I did.

The box is not wood, as many people on message boards have been asking. However, it is a very sturdy, thick, pressed cardboard (one of the sturdiest box sets I've seen) covered with a beautiful glossy finish. Inside you will find the individual season sets in the dreaded thin slip cases. I know many people complain about these, but really, I have never had any discs that came in this type of holder to be permanently damaged. I have had some surface scuffs in the past, but nothing that ever affected the playback. The individual seasons are the same as the previous releases, with all the same features, just in these slip cases. The artwork on these slip cases are not of the previous releases...these match each other...but the artwork on the discs all appear to be from the previous releases. I would also like to note that I have had no issues as far as glue being on the discs, discs being dislodged, or any of the issues that I have noticed in other reviews. Perhaps I lucked up with a good, clean set...?

The bonus disc comes in a cute little apple shaped sleeve, and has the following features:
The End of the Lane: Last Days on Set
Curtain Call: The Desperate Housewives Family
Cherry Cam(eo)
Desperately Dead
More From the Series (which consists of some new bonus features from Seasons 3 & 5)

Finally, there is a note from Marc Cherry, printed on a thick paper stock (about 5x7 inches) that looks much like a wedding invitation, with embossed designs, where he is basically telling the origins of the show idea and thanks the fans.

I love this set, and I am planning to revisit the women, men and all the rest of the residents of Wisteria Lane from beginning to end. And I'm sure I will revisit them again & again in the years to come.",1348531200,72,1981,4.431318681318682
5171419,2,B008O13TG4,"Is anyone else having a horrible experience with the packaging. The bottom disc on every sleeve of my set has come dislodged and the cardboard sleeve detached resulting in every other disc smashed up against the glue that was supposed to hold the sleeve together. Every other disc in the entire set has sticky glue on the back of the disc. I guess I can clean them? Never had to clean glue off of a DVD before...certainly not a brand new $100 set. I actually had to peel some discs off of the sleeve. Displeased.

Great show- awful packaging...and isn't the packaging the whole point of a Complete Collection???",1348531200,44,611,4.605504587155964
5171420,4,B008O13TG4,"I know I was wondering! It's not wood (didn't expect it to be but one can hope!) but it's very sturdy. It really is a beautiful box and will last a long time. Not too thrilled that the discs are in sleeve type packaging though!
Awesome series for an awesome price!",1348531200,5,264,4.196078431372549
5171421,5,B008O13TG4,"I got mine a day early, I was absolutely thrilled! It's been great so far, no skipping or anything.  It's awesome having my favorite show of all time in one awesome box.  Watching the bonus disc right now and it's a nice little addition to have to the collection.  All in all, I'd say it's well worth it!

EDIT (10/16/12): Just wanted to let everybody know, I have watched all 8 seasons and every episode plays perfectly.  I did have to re-glue some flaps on seasons 1-4, but other than that it was all good. Still a 5 star rating to me and I look forward to enjoying this collection for years to come!",1348444800,5,602,4.245614035087719
5171422,4,B008O13TG4,"I have collected each season as they were released, watched every episode as they aired, and have preordered Season 8 as soon as it was listed on Amazon. This deluxe edition is a great savings over the seperate sets,if you don't already own 1 thru 7, but why-oh-why must they be in such destructive packaging. I get the idea of bio-degradable paper to save the earth and all that, but please - I'm not buying a deluxe collector's set to put it in landfill! These slide-in slots scream self destruction to the discs, often during the manufacturing process before I even get them. So minus 1 star... paper or plastic? Save it for disposable consumed goods, not my archive of favorite shows.",1348099200,11,688,4.647540983606557

Very satisfied.

5171427,3,B008O13TG4,I love this show. And was excited to get it in the mail. I began watching them and then my discs started skipping mid episode. At first I thought the disc was scratched or dirty. So I took it out and cleaned em. Then it kept skipping/freezing so I though my DVD player was just old. So I went and bought a new one then it kept happening. I then emailed amazon and was disappointed to find out they couldn't replace it and they'd refund my money. But I had gotten it for such a good deal I decided to just keep them and replace the discs that were not working. Should have read the reviews. Still such a good show.,1459036800,3,613,4.074380165289257

5171446,3,B008O13TG4,Enjoy the box it is quite beautiful. My only complaint is that my bonus disc was really scratched because it wasn't held in any sturdy case (basically a paper pamphlet) and that some of the discs had glue from the packaging on them. My husband was able to get the glue off easily but still should have been packaged better. Love the show though.,1437091200,,345,4.40625
5171447,1,B008O13TG4,Several discs are scratched or had adhesive from the box which had to be cleaned. Disappointed.,1436832000,,95,5.0
5171448,4,B008O13TG4,"We LOVE Desperate Housewives, so I was thrilled to purchase this. The reason I gave it four stars instead of five is because some of the discs are scratched up quite significantly. Thus far, all of the discs we have watched have played with no issues but we are only thru seasons one and two. Also, the ""glue"" everyone is griping about in the reviews is nothing more than those sticky dots that are often seen holding gift cards to their paper backing. It does not permanently stick to the discs, in fact, I have not had any issues with it whatsoever. All in all, I would highly recommend this to any Desperate Housewives lover!",1435881600,,628,4.469565217391304

5171454,4,B008O13TG4,"Been watching these daily. Up to season 3. I haven't had any unplayable discs but have had some episodes which give me the ""skipping over damaged area"" message and Skips about 10mins of the episode. However, I think this might be from residual glue. I've had to clean almost all of the bottom discs because of the shoddy glue job on the packaging. Very happy with the box set otherwise, but they used a gummy, poor quality glue for the sleeves. The best way to fix this is to peel off the gummy glue and use your own hot glue to secure them. Otherwise, no complaints and haven't had any unplayable discs yet. Thankfully.",1432512000,,620,4.447368421052632

5171457,1,B008O13TG4,"Consumer beware on this product! I didn't want to believe the negative reviews, but unfortunately they turned out to be true. There are several poorly created disks hidden in the series that do not work no matter what you do. Unless you watch the entire show day and night you are highly unlikely to find these until after your return period has ended. Terribly disappointing being this was a birthday gift for my wife. That said, the packaging looks nice... Probably the only good thing I can say after the shoddy CD craftsmanship. Maybe we could use them as expensive coasters? Its a Hodgepodge and a complete ripoff, one disk will work, and the next will be defective, one episode will work, and the next will be defective... Its like wading through a minefield and wishing for the best each time. Very frustrating. And good luck finding someone to contact. I did send a product review to the seller, but we'll see what good it does. Save your money, some people might have lucked out, but by all accounts I'm suspicious at this point that a bunch of company employees didn't just jump on and write good reviews -- this seems to be the latest trend on Amazon and other rating web services...",1430352000,3,1194,4.610328638497653
5171458,5,B008O13TG4,Love the show and all the drama only complaint is the places where the DVDS are held in each book season are ripped. Looks like someone tried to use sticky stuff to hold the flaps down.,1430265600,,185,4.166666666666667

5171466,5,B008O13TG4,Perfect! Everything was better than I expected!!,1426291200,,48,6.0
5171467,1,B008O13TG4,"Warning: Many discs in this set do not work. Some episodes play for only a few minutes and then stop. They have no data on them. At least 2-3 discs per season do not work. And, as others have said, some discs don't come out of the packaging due to glue. Amazon expects you to be able to watch 8 seasons in 30 days in order to get your money back. Horrible and wrong!!!

Edit: After arguing with customer service twice, I was able to get most of my money back. I had to pay $20 for a new set. I will certainly be testing these out before 30 days runs up to avoid that scam again.

Second edit: after receiving a second set, many discs were still broken. However, they were different than those that were broken in the first set. By combining the two sets, I now have a full working set. The second set also did not have glued discs like the first one did. I would suggest ordering 2 sets of you would really like this set and doing what I did. Return the broken set.  A quick way to test them is to simply ""play all"" and press fast forward. The broken discs will stop halfway (or less) through an episode. This review aside, this is my all time favorite show and a day does not go by without me watching it. I just wish they would have used better quality discs to avoid this frustration.

One more thing: I bought a black cd holder case off of amazon and put the discs into it because the cd cases of the DH set are really cheap/flimsy. The discs slide around which would make them get scratched.",1425686400,7,1496,4.130584192439863

5171469,1,B008O13TG4,"Just as other customers have commented, about half of my DVDs had glue on them. It looks like the manufacturer of the cases uses glue to make the DVD pockets, but the paper comes loose from the glue. When the paper comes loose, the DVDs shift around, and end up sliding into the glue. This is a very easy fix- I have no idea why the manufacturer doesn't either use better glue or another way to create the DVD pockets.

It's a shame no one at the manufacturer's company is apparently reading these customer reviews- just reading the reviews, it looks like this has been a problem for years now.

It's a shame I have to return these because the DVDs themselves and the rest of the packaging is great. One little sloppy detail is ruining an otherwise good product.",1425254400,2,762,4.435714285714286

I didn't notice it got stuck on one disk which got stuck inside my Blu Ray player and even though I bought a Blu Ray player disk cleaner it remained stuck so my player was ruined and unable to read any Blu Rays at all. I had to buy a disk cleaner for about $10, a new Blue Ray player for about $110 and waste hours hooking up the new Blu Ray player and registering it to accept all the stuff I had before (e.g. Netflix, Pandora, etc.).

5171501,1,B008O13TG4,"Against the advice of other reviewers i went ahead and bought this set. To buy all the individual seasons at the time of me writing this was nearly double the price of the complete collection. so i took the risk and hoped i got lucky. I did not. Nearly every single season had at least one disc that had glue on the edges of it. I did my best to remove it with lens cleaning wipes i use for my glasses but it just left a permanent stain on the disc when i got the glue off. The effected discs would not play through all the way, not only would they skip but it would freeze my player up entirely and force me to unplug it to eject. After trying to save 4 discs in 3 different seasons i gave up and resigned to return it.

Its unfortunate that so many complete series sets have similar problems with bad packaging. The manufacturers need to wise up and realize that no matter how aesthetically pleasing the box is storing DVDs in between cardboard, and in the case with this set, glue that is not fully dried is not practical and leads to these frustrations and ultimately wastes time and money for the consumer. If this was offered as Blu Ray the problem might not be so severe and the discs might be able to be saved as it is hard to intentionally scratch or stain Blu Ray discs.

My advice is to save up more and buy each season individually or wait for them to be reduced in price. Unless of course you have the time and the tools necessary to salvage this set it is not worth the hassle.",1378339200,4,1491,4.155709342560554

But like so many other reviewers, the whole thing is completely WRECKED for me by the stupid, avoidable mistake of the way the DVDs are housed in their wallets. I'm estimating here, but I would say at least a quarter of the DVDs were 'stuck' in their pockets with the most vicious glue I have ever come across - having forcibly removed them from their slots, we are talking having to use nail varnish remover (for the acetone) to make any kind of impression on it at all. As I do actually have a life, I have not had a chance to test all the 'cleaned' discs yet, but I can't imagine that they will all play all the way through without any problems, given the difficulty I had in removing the glue. I fully expect to have to re-buy at least some of the seasons over the coming months, as I come across the problems. AVOID!",1372032000,6,905,4.236994219653179

5171536,5,B008O13TG4,"I love Desperate Housewives! I 'grew up' with this show through it's original run, so I am overjoyed to see a Complete Series release. The set itself is truly adorable, with the box designed to look like a wooden chest, featuring gold detailing around the corners and a 'keyhole' to unlock the secrets of Wisteria Lane. The top of the box is embossed with the Adam and Eve design from the opening credits. Inside, the DVDs are housed in various books representing each of the seasons, four on each side. To me, they resemble photo albums and they sport quotes from the shows as well as stills from certain episodes. The bonus disc is housed in a separate sleeve designed to look like an apple. Indeed, apples are featured throughout the box set, one being showcased on the underside of the lid in rich, gleaming crimson and the season books each feature an apple in the stages of being eaten, until only the core remains on the back of the final season. All in all, I could not be happier with Buena Vista and their treatment of this iconic show! The set is rich in detail and most certainly appears like a collector's piece.

5171539,3,B008O13TG4,"I read the reviews before purchasing this set and i noticed a lot of reviews saying that there were glue on several disks due to the cheap sleeves they came in. Well i just received my set today. I love the show and i bought the set when it was part of the gold box deal of the day so i only paid $62 for it. The majority of my disks are fine. However, there is one disk that has so much glue on it that i doubt it is playable. I will try and figure out how to get the glue off without ruining it because it is not until the fifth season. Another disk that has a fair amount of glue on it is he bonus features of season five which i am not too concerned about. A couple other disks have a tiny bit of glue right on the edge which i doubt will be an issue. The one disk that has the most glue on it though was not in the sleeve but had come loose and was resting on top of the disk above it and the flap to the sleeve had come undone which is why there is so much glue on the disk i assume. If it weren't for such cheap packaging, all the disks would be in perfect condition. I love the show and the majority of the disks are fine so i won't be returning it but for a complete collection like this there should be better packaging for the disks. People are willing to pay quite a bit of money for the series they love so the packaging they come in shouldn't be horrendous. I give 3 stars due to the crappy packaging. The show itself is definitely 5 stars.

Update 5/22/13: I have decided as of today to return the series. I do love the show but I decided that seeing as i paid quite a bit for this series that I shouldn't have to watch some of the episodes on Netflix. I could't figure out how to get the glue off so I think it is time to get a refund. For those of you who aren't picky and it wouldn't bother you much to watch a few of the episodes elsewhere, I would still recommend the show because most of the disks are fine.

5171560,3,B008O13TG4,"The show is easily 5 stars. This collection is a little disappointing. The box that it comes in is very sturdy cardboard and does indeed look nice. Once you open it, there are four book like holders on each side of the box. On most pages, there is a disc on top and one in front on the bottom. Almost every booklet I went through, the bottom flap was not connected and the disc itself was stuck to the tiny drop of glue that apparently was supposed to keep this all together. Great series. Beautiful outer packaging. Horrible inner packaging.",1354147200,4,542,4.43

I did not like that some of the glue from the packaging got stuck on the DVDS, but just wiping it up with a damp cloth lightly will make it come off with harming the disc. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to enjoy this show for the rest of their life like I did!!",1353715200,,378,3.858974358974359
5171566,2,B008O13TG4,"Great series.  Some bumpy seasons for sure but a stellar cast really holds the show together.  However, for being the complete collection of this emmy winning series, they sure did skimp on the package.  The cardboard dvd holders, (as almost all reviewers mention) are awful.  They do not hold or secure the discs and they are held together by a little drop of glue and in fact, a couple of my disc (bottom ones) would get stuck in the glue.  Not sure why ABC and Buena Vista went so cheap but I would have rather paid $20-$30 more for a complete series set that would not ruin my dvds.",1351468800,4,586,4.339449541284404

They are very flimsy and held together with a little sticky glue that doesn't actually stick , so dvds don't stay in their slots well. But that is what everybody else who got it said too.",1351468800,2,330,4.092307692307692

Once I received it of course I wasn't going to wait for my friends to join me and I started watching it. I got to season 1 disk 2 and I learned that the disc had slipped out of its position and was stuck to the glue that holds the envelope of disks together. I tried cleaning it with rubbing alcohol but It  had ruined the disk and I found the same thing happened to season 2 and season 3, all with disk 2. Luckily what won't play on either of my players I can stream from netflix but this is a packaging fail and I am very disappointed.",1351382400,6,691,3.832167832167832

I had to put tape on the back side of some of them to keep it together. I had 2 discs that had glue on them. I did my best to get it off, and they seem to play fine. The box itself is very nice looking, and seems to be sturdy. Even with the folder problem, I am very happy with my purchase. At $89.99, what a bargain! The manufacturers of this set should find a better way to house these discs. It's a shame as other than that issue, it would have been a perfect boxset.",1349222400,4,604,3.763779527559055

I have to say first off that the box is beautiful and everything came fine so thanks Amazon! It was when I opened the box that the problems started.

Also NO EPISODE BOOKLET are you kidding 180 episode and we get no episode booklet with synopsis or anything but rather a list of the episodes...LET DOWN.
