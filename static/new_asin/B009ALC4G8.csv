5299486,5,B009ALC4G8,"Because of the high price tag, I'm guessing that anyone who is seriously considering buying this set has already seen the series.  So this review is mostly of the set rather than of the series itself.  If you haven't seen Bakemonogatari, it is one of the most intelligent series ever produced.  The word play, the characters, the symbolism, the spirituality, and even the fan service are all incredibly well thought out and brilliantly executed.  It's very different from other shows...  Most of the screen-time is simply two characters sitting around talking to each other.  If you are looking for action, you will probably be bored out of your mind by this show.  But if you can watch a show that's nothing but dialog, there is none better than Bakemonogatari.  At any rate, if you haven't seen the series, I would strongly suggest watching before purchasing this set.

On to the set itself.  The art box and the blu-ray cases are all beautiful.  There's also a booklet which gives summaries of each arc of the series, as well as descriptions of each character.  The subtitles are not quite as good as some of the fansubs I've seen, but overall they are pretty strong.  The real selling point for this set though, is the commentary.

Each episode of the series has commentary from the original Japanese cast.  The commentary is not really about the show, and there's no additional behind the scenes information given.  Furthermore, the commentary is really not done by the cast, but rather by the characters.  It is just like the word-play comedy from the series, but even more non-stop.  I think the easiest idea I can give you is to give a except of a conversation between Senjogahara and Kanbaru...  They have just established that ""DVD"" must stand for ""Domestic Violence, level D;"" and they are trying to figure out where the term ""blu-ray"" comes from...  Senjogahara starts:

""Well they are packaged in blue cases.""
""I think that the packaging is designed to reflect the name, not the other way around.""
""Maybe whoever picked the name was an Evangelion fan.  He wanted to see a 'blue Rei disc.' ""
""Ah.""
""But I think the English leaves off the 'e.'  It's just B-L-U.""
""Ah, hearing Senjogahara-sempai saying 'BL' is getting me excited!  We should change the name of blu-rays to just BLDs, for 'BL discs!' ""

Anyway, the commentary is relentless boke-boke humor, done completely in character...  If you loved the show, it would be worth it to get this set just for the commentary.

Now I can't look at a blu-ray disc without picturing Ayanami....",1386028800,9,2550,4.775743707093821
5299487,5,B009ALC4G8,"I second all the enthusiastic comments about this series; its stylistic artistry, offbeat but engaging characters, excellent music, and original storylines.  It's very entertaining, a near masterpiece...but it's also much more.

This series is (amazingly) a useful tool for those learning to speak and especially to read Japanese, or for those just curious about how the language works.  If you're watching the series online or on TV you have to be very quick with the 'pause' button to see most of this content, which usually goes by at almost subliminal speed.  I don't own the Blu-Ray set but I'm sure it would be much easier to view the flashcard-like still frames (I'm dating myself here!) that contain everything from Zen koans (stories) to 'fill-in-the-missing-English-letters' puzzles.  Translated phrases from the characters' dialog are often shown in both ideograms and cursive forms, puns are explained, and I'm sure there's many more subtleties I'm missing due to my admittedly poor comprehension.

Not everyone will care to explore this 'hidden' content, but I recommend it heartily to anyone wishing to better understand Japanese culture and language.  If there was ever a set that would justify paying a high cost, it's this one.",1384214400,2,1244,5.252525252525253

This show is my fav. if it wasn't i wouldnt have bought it. if it was just an okay show to me i wouldve just watched in on Hulu and been done with it.

5299489,5,B009ALC4G8,"Worth the wait, definitely a must watch. This was seriously great . The series is incredible and really well thought of",1370131200,,119,4.714285714285714
5299490,5,B009ALC4G8,"I realize it might not be everybody's cup of tea, but personally (it is my review haha) I loved the wordplay. Having already watched Bakemonogatari thru streaming sites, I fell in love every week with the episodes, including the online only ones. Now though, I see it on my PS3 and my hi-def setup. God, if my eyes could have orgasms, they would from having watched all fifteen episodes.

From Hitagi Crab to Tsubasa Cat, I was hooked in the tale of Araragi Koyomi, former vampire and chick magnet with a penchant for sharp retorts. The way that words are exchanged and twisted into different meanings had me cracking up for hours, and its mainly the reason why they didn't add a dub. It just doesn't work with the way the Japanese characters are manipulated, and the jokes just don't seem to work in English. I'm really glad there was no dub in actuality.

So yeah, I don't really want to say much else. For new people looking to pick this up, I realize the boxset is a little steep on the wallet (not sure if I got my metaphors mixed up...), but it is a story that will get you hooked for it's sequels and novels. For people who have already seen the series, I wouldn't really recommend buying it unless you really love it. It is better than paying as much as the Japanese did for the 5 separate boxsets that would total more than my monthly paycheck could afford, and the clarity from watching it in blu-ray is quite frankly, amazing. Only for the hardcore-est of the core. God i'm so lame.",1362614400,37,1493,4.425454545454546

8538466,5,B009ALC4G8,"Easily one of the greatest anime of all time, this adaptation of NISIOSINs masterwork is must see viewing for anyone who likes intelligent dialogue, great characters and just tremendous entertainment. It is an amazing example of what anime is capable of, with great fun with wordplay, and almost surreal animation styling. It's not just a stellar anime, it is one of the best shows in any format.

Bakemonogatari tells five interconnected stories of supernatural monsters/aberrations that are encountered by our hero, Koyomi Araragi, a high school senior whose first memorable encounter is with the falling Hitagi Senjoygahara (Senjougahara), whom he catches on his schools stairs, only to discover that she has virtually no weight. Senjougahara is not a happy camper about this fact being discovered, and takes extreme steps to ensure that Araragi remains silent. But Araragi has a secret himself: Hes a former vampire, and has a contact who specializes in the supernatural, Meme Oshino, who saved Araragi and class president Tsubasa Hanekawa.  And so our tale takes off, dealing with the crab god who took Senjougaharas weight, the Lost Snail involved with Mayoi Hachikuji, the monkey paw affecting Senjougaharas junior classmate, Suruga Kanbaru, the snake stalking Nadeko Sengoku, a classmate of Araragis youngest sister, and last and not least, the cat problems of Tsubasa Hanekawa. Also key to this story is the newly named Shinobu Oshino, the remnants of the vampire who infected Araragi.

Oh, and the really good news? The commentary track. The cast stays in character for the commentary track. So we don't get commentary from amazing voice actress Yui Horie; we get truly amazing commentary from Tsubasa Hanekawa, with two cast members commenting each episode, rotating throughout. The result is spectacular fun, essentially giving the viewer 15 entirely different episodes to watch.

There are some points to pick: The translation is at times questionable, but mostly serviceable. It's always jarring to hear a word in ""Engrish"" which is mistranslated in the subtitles. And as always, the decision to attempt to localize the always complicated world of Japanese honorifics is a mistake. The biggest point to pick is the pricing. With a retail price of $189.98, (priced on Amazon on 2-18-2017 @ $174.99), this is insanely overpriced for 15 anime episodes.

Allow me to explain: This is Aniplexs pricing plan, which follows the Japanese model, which is: We know who likes this and were going to milk them for everything we can. Aniplex targets the existing hardcore fanbase and gets their guaranteed money from that existing fanbase. Hence the extreme pricing (for the West; this is, as I said, the Japanese anime business model). So instead of trying to grow their fanbase with more competitive pricing, they stick with what they know. It's worth noting that there are presently 75 full length episodes, with an additional 12 shorter web episodes, which does not count the 3 part movie that is the prequel to Bakemonogatari.

At least it looks and sounds magnificent. Each story section has its own opening, sung by the main heroine of that story arc, with a great closing number for all the episodes. We have the set divided into each story section Hitagi Crabs 2 episodes on Disc 1, Mayoi MaiMai on Disc 2, Suruga Monkey on Disc 3, Nadeko Snake on Disc 4, and Tsubasa Cat on Discs 5 and 6.

Of note:
-There are two different visuals for the versions of sugar sweet nightmare in Tsubasa Cat, sung by Yui Horie. Many of the original openings were not ready for their original TV broadcasts, which is why staple stable, the first opening number, is seen in Tsubasa Cat, and why it is seen on many of the episodes where the show is legally streamed.
-Only the first 12 episodes were broadcast on TV in Japan, and is why legal streaming in the USA only has the first 12 episodes.

In short, this is not A+, it is A+++. Yes, its that good. The only question is the price, a legitimate concern. It is barely tolerable at a great sale price because of the commentaries, effectively giving you a total of 30 shows of must-watch viewing. So far above highly recommended you wouldnt believe it. Go watch this.",1487376000,,4208,4.95042492917847

8538470,5,B009ALC4G8,"This is the greatest and most sublime anime ever.

Ever.

The box set is nice, and you get your money's worth on that end, with the character book and nice BD covers. The BD's are great quality, virtually no issues whatsoever except the changes SHAFT made - which aren't that noticeable nor are they poor editing choices. It looks fantastic.

You even get the option to have some on-screen captions for the Japanese characters that are shown throughout the show - such as on street signs and other random objects - but the best part is the original cast's commentary.

The Japanese commentary could very well be worth half of the price, if not all of it. Extremely radical how true to character and theme everything remains throughout this anime.

No English dub - which is perfect because this couldn't be done in English - too much wordplay on Japanese characters and rhymes that would not go over well if converted to an English dub. They rhyme and associate words according to how they speak Engrish and how certain words in Japanese whether kanji, katakana, and/or hiragana sound, or are put together legibly - i.e. combining words or symbols into a new word or symbol. Bakemonogatari is highly witty in that aspect, because they will do random association with Engrish words that sound a lot like Japanese words that mean a whole different thing and wondering if they're connected somehow.

This is worth every penny, and if you enjoyed the series, I highly suggest you pick this up, as well as Nisemonogatari while you can.",1419638400,4,1530,4.754716981132075
