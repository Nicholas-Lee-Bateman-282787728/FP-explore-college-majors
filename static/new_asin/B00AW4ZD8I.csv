8558175,5,B00AW4ZD8I,"Flicker Alley and David Shepard have out done the old Criterion DVD of Nanook of the North.  Criterion is generally the level of excellence to match, but Flicker Alley is quickly showing they are also the name for quality.

""NANOOK OF THE NORTH"" (1922)  (170 min, silent with music)
The biggest improvement I see is cleaner motion.  The old Criterion transfer suffered from ""Motion Blur"" possibly due to slowing down the film to silent film speed.  The Criterion DVD also had an interlace stutter that caused objects moving up & down to jitter as they moved.  This was quite noticeable just after the titles when we see the rolling sea of ice.  The Ice jitters up & down on the old DVD.  No window-boxing.

There is also an improvement in the image sharpness, the Criterion looks like 16mm (they claim it is from a 35mm fine grain mastered from a 35mm restoration negative derived from positive nitrate prints). I am very surprised at how poor the Criterion transfer looks.

The Flicker Alley transfer seems to come from the same 1972 restoration negative, but this time it looks like 35mm. There is some film dust in the picture, but not distracting.  But now BLUE COLOR TINTS have been added to the last 10 minutes as the title card reads ""It is now getting dark"".

The original title card must be lost as both transfers re-create the main title.  Criterions inserts images from the movir which looks wrong, I thought it was another DVD menu.  The Flicker Alley title card tries to look more original with with lettering over black background, but it is too sharp and still looks recreated.

""NANOOK'S"" music score is the same exact score as on the Criterion DVD. Composed by Timothy Brock in 1998 and performed by The Olympia Chamber Orchestra.

As you can tell by the title of this release, this is a DOUBLE FEATURE

""THE WEDDING OF PALO"" (1934) makes it's home video debut (correct me if I am wrong).  (112 min, sound)
The presentation is nice with only one flaw, it is WINDOW-BOXED which is totally unnecessary on Blu-ray.  Window-boxing was necessary at times for the old CRT-TVs that badly over-scanned, but HD-TVs set for the ""Native"" presentation will not overscan. Although a single 35mm film source is claimed to be used, it looks like several different film elements have been used to make that print as the aspect ratio changes slightly on some shots.  A thick frame line can be seen at the bottom of some shots and occasionally a thin frame line can be seen at the top.  Most of the time there is no visible frame line. The image is moderately sharp but slightly grainy, but for a documentary filmed at this time it looks great!  There is a slight flicker through out the film but it is not distracting.

The soundtrack is synchronized with the picture but sounds like the voices were recorded in a studio and synced to the picture.  Sound effects are often missing. You see someone fall into the water but you don't hear a splash, you just hear the people laugh.  Narration is done by on-screen subtitles and English translations are done by English dialogue cards.

While ""Nanook"" seems to be documenting everyday life, ""Palo"" has more of a narrative style but not as bad as a 'Docu-drama'.  It still feels authentic.

BONUS MATERIAL.  David Shepard & Flicker Alley giveth & taketh away.
Missing:  The Criterion DVD had a short 8:13 excerpt from the NET (National Educational Television) TV show ""Flaherty and Film"" that interviews Robert Flaherty's wife about her husband and the making of Nanook.  I will have to ask David why this was omitted, but I suspect it is because her remarks about 'modern' documentaries is degrading.  She calls them low budget 16mm short films not intended for the mass audiences in theaters (don't tell Kevin Smith).  Now days this is not true and this may be why Davis Shepard omitted this.

BUT there are NEW bonuses (no window-boxing):
disc 1
NANOOK REVISITED - a 1988 64 minute documentary by Claude Mascott interviewing today's Inuit people after they watched the vintage ""Nanook"" film.
HOUSES OF THE ARTIC (1928) - an excerpt from Nanook that was re-edited as a short subject.
disc 2
CAPTAIN KLEINSCHMIDT'S THE ARTIC HUNT (1913) Arctic Film Company - tinted 35mm, 15 minutes.
PRIMITIVE LOVE (1927) - 32 minutes of excerpts from two films by Frank E. Kleinschmidt: ""Winter In the Arctic"" and ""Polar Bear and Seal"". Both appear to be from 35mm.
THE EARTH AND IT'S PEOPLES : ESKIMO HUNTERS OF THE NORTHWEST (1949) - by Louis de Rochemont, United World Films - 20 minutes, 16mm
FACE OF THE HIGH ARTIC (1959) - Dalton Muir, National Film Board of Canada - 13 minutes, appears to be 35mm

There is an extensive 32 page illustrated booklet with essays.",1407456000,7,4699,4.709914320685434
8558176,5,B00AW4ZD8I,What a marvellous film and considering the age and the conditions under which it was filmed this is an extraordinary offering. The transfer is excellent.,1406246400,,153,5.16
8558177,5,B00AW4ZD8I,"...are the two words I would use to describe this recent Flicker Alley release. Exhilarating in that there is now a quality copy of NANOOK on Blu-Ray. There is also the availability of the other rare films on Disc 2 although the visual quality doesn't match that of NANOOK. No matter, just being able to see them is the key point here. The depressing part comes with the 1988 French documentary NANOOK REVISITED which revisits the same locations Robert Flaherty used almost 70 years later. The use of color film and sound heightens the drab reality of the locals' everyday existence although it's fascinating to watch them watching NANOOK and laughing at some of the inaccuracies while soaking up this visual record of their past. Most everyone knows that Flaherty staged a number of scenes in NANOOK but it was poignant to hear a local man say that he was deliberately trying to record on film Inuit life before the ""White Man"" came and wouldn't allow them to use anything contemporary. It would be interesting to visit Port Harrison today and see how life there has changed since 1988.

NANOOK now looks better than it ever has thanks to the digital transfer of David Shepard's 1972 restoration. The film is aided immeasureably by Timothy Brock's score which is not only atmospheric (the use of harp in the walrus hunt is especially effective) but somewhat melancholy as befits the always harsh surroundings Nanook and his family lived in. Knud Rasmussen's THE WEDDING OF PALO shows us Eskimo (Inuit) life on the Western Coast of Greenland circa 1933 which presents a very different world from that of NANOOK. Greenland in the summer is full of vegetation and in addition to seal, there is musk ox and salmon to sustain the community. Unfortunately Rasmussen is no Flaherty and his attempt to come up with a storyline is much less satisfactory as it relies too much on Western European romantic cliches. Nevertheless the footage is remarkable and we do get a glimpse at what the Greenlanders' life is like although more title cards would have been helpful.  Highlights are the drum dance, the salmon run, and the village shaman's healing techniques.

The remaining films on the second disc consist of two silent sequences from Frank Kleinschmidt, a Harvard reworking of the building of the igloo from NANOOK, and two later sound shorts about Inuit and Arctic life. I was already familiar with Kleinschmidt from a silent film called SANTA CLAUS (1925) which incorporates North Pole footage with Christmas Eve activities. ARCTIC HUNT (1913) & PRIMITIVE LOVE (1927) resemble NANOOK in content but not in style. The two other offerings, ESKIMO HUNTERS OF NORTHWESTERN ALASKA (1949) and FACE OF THE HIGH ARCTIC (1959) give us more of the same with the addition of documentary style voiceovers. After awhile it all starts to run together but the historical value of these films coupled with the historic and artistic value of NANOOK make this a valuable set to have. It's not for everyone and it's more than a little pricey but those interested in different cultures and exploration will find it hard to resist. Flicker Alley has done their usual fine job with another stylish presentation and extra features including an invaluable booklet on the material.",1391904000,5,3253,4.9216757741347905
