8621011,2,B00G5YTMCC,Too much anger by David Suchett in this movie ruined a good story for me. Not how I would imagine Poirot to act.,1519862400,,112,3.9130434782608696

8621013,4,B00G5YTMCC,"Possible spoilers.  There are numerous big and little screen version of Agatha Christiess most famous novel.  This version was produced for television by WGBH in Boston and Englands iTV Studios.  It is always fun to see others take on well-known stories and this is no exception.  I liked the recent (2017) version with Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot, the famous Belgian detective.  I am also a fan of the first version I remember, from 1974 with Albert Finney in the role.  This version is their equal if not better.

After a brief beginning in Israel where Poirot (David Suchet) settles a dispute between religious leaders over the theft of artifacts, he gets a call to come to London to help with a case.  He decides to take the train to Calais, France then sail across the Channel and on to London.  The famed Orient Express train is his transportation.  The well-known plot features the murder of a high profile mobster/businessman named Ratchett (Toby Jones) who is in the first class sleeping car along with Poirot and 12 other passengers.  The first thing I found interesting is the cast itself which features Jessica Chastain, David Morrissey, Barbara Hershey and others.

When the train is stopped by deep snow, Poirot is asked to solve the crime.  It had to be someone on the car because the doors to the other cars are locked at night.  In both the 74 and the 17 versions, Poirot solves the murder and announces how he deduced it in a highly staged final scene.  In this version, it is more of a conversation he is having with everyone gathered in the dining car.  This mostly British production is itself a bit stuffy and more serious relative to the other 2 versions Ive seen, yet I found it to be surprisingly fresh.

I also have to say that the Blu ray version I watched was a bit of a disappointment.  A lot of grain shows up, especially in the dark scenes.  Some scenes are fine.  Also note that the audio is Dolby Digital 2.0.  The special features include a 45 minute documentary where Suchet takes us on a journey across Europe on the Orient Express.  Here the video is first rate.",1514764800,2,2105,4.587131367292225
8621014,5,B00G5YTMCC,"Just the documentary, included in the Special Features section, about the Orient Express nowadays is worth your while. David Suchet is,  indeed, the quintessential Poirot.",1513555200,,171,5.84
8621015,3,B00G5YTMCC,"Unfortunetly, this is not the Albert Finney version. (That version is not available as far as I know for North American dvd players.) O.K., I knew that going in. This adaptation was for me very difficult to get into and thus I quit it after about 20 minutes. I suspect the acting, costumes and photography is excellent throughout, the rather quick pace of this adaptation just didn't turn me on.",1512604800,,395,4.6571428571428575
8621016,5,B00G5YTMCC,Very enjoyable.  Always love David Suchet as Hercule Poirot.,1508544000,,60,5.666666666666667
