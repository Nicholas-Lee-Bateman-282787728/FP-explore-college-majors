8521560,1,B007RX9WRK,Parker Posey is brilliant as usual.  They should've edited everyone else out.,1494892800,,77,5.416666666666667
8521561,5,B007RX9WRK,"I've been a lifelong Parker Posey fan, and am willing to invest time to watch anything she is in -- and I think I have enjoyed every movie she has been in if it was only because she is so odd and interesting.  She can say very silly or ridiculous things, but they stick in your mind because of how she says them and she gives them more meaning than was probably intended.  This movie starts off slow, however, being a vegan myself, and constantly thinking about the lives of farm animals being taken over by industry which is removing human contact and even the experience of the earth which animals should have -- it is nice to see a plot about a family who is torn between these two ideas.  The chickens in the movie are so beautiful -- I have never lived on a farm, so it was enjoyable to see these beautiful chickens and learn what kind they were.  The movie wanted to make me move to a farm where I could grow everything organically -- and help people understand that being vegan is the healthiest way and the move loving way.  The scene where Parker watches her own egg hatch is touching and sad and I related somehow.  Some might find the scene silly, but  if you have been abandoned in your life -- somehow at that moment there seems to be some attempt at an explanation for Parker's feeling she becomes invisible -- even though her moments of disappearing are supposed to be a cosmic departure -- but I think on another level it is a simpler idea of not being connected with a family or her own parents/sibling and having no children.  The movie does start slow.  And some parts are a bit slow, but it is really so well done, and there is so much beauty to see it is worth it.  Every scene is so vividly planned out and there is so much to take in -- and it seems very authentically done.  The entire movie seems very short though.  I think it is 1 hour and 22 minutes or something like that.  I believe Best in Show is Parker's best role to date -- and I wish that character she played in that movie with her husband in the movie would have had a spin off movie.  Back to The Love Guide -- I also come from a yoga background so I understand all of the things she is talking about -- and they are true -- You can certainly have those experiences she  and others have in the world (and out of the world).  It is a movie that probably most people won't appreciate, but I loved it and will watch it again.",1491350400,,2411,4.174946004319654
8521562,3,B007RX9WRK,"Something akin to a Pauly Shore down on the farm type movie only with a flaky Parker Posey as a Reality TV host/guru type whose production people try and exact some juicy happenings out of a boring farm couple down on their luck.  Posey is good, but the rest of the cast for the most part falls pretty flat, not much to make this into a good movie, as they didn't really get serious enough with the satire, not bad, but not good either 2.5 stars.  Recommended only if you like Parker Posey and the crazy rolls she can immerse herself in.",1474243200,,537,4.254901960784314
8521563,4,B007RX9WRK,"On first glance, a lightweight film. But the acting is good, and the plot, or rather meaning of the film, is like an iceberg: most of it is discovered upon reflection and hindsight. Don't give up on it too quickly. Parker Posey brings a greater depth to any scripted character, and it's true in this film.",1468713600,,305,4.464285714285714
8521564,2,B007RX9WRK,"useful only as a warning about pretended ""reality"" shows and the scammers who run them",1464825600,,86,4.8
8521565,4,B007RX9WRK,"I almost missed the beauty of this film because I kept falling asleep in the middle. However, I was determined to make it to the end, and I'm glad I did. What began as a farcical comedy ended as a lighthearted lesson in the dangers of allowing others into your sacred subconscious space. I loved the way this film pokes fun at so-called ""reality"" TV and all things (mis)labeled as New Age. Parker Posey is perfectly charming at times and totally annoying at other times. Hmmm, sounds like a true-to-life character to me. It should be noted that I am a Reiki practitioner and light worker, so my opinions are formed from that foundation.",1403740800,,636,4.587719298245614
8521566,4,B007RX9WRK,"Many would be critical over this film. But if you like Parker Posey,and I do you will Enjoy this. It has something to do with the way she delivers her lines that give it so much punch. Some think a little goes a long way with Miss Posey but i disagree I love it when she is the star of the movie such as Party Girl, House of Yes,and now this little gem the Love Guide. This is light comedy and should be judged as such. I think the director let her run wild -but I love that. This is not heavy stuff,just some fun entertainment on a dull day. If you like Parker the way I do check it out.",1356393600,,588,3.8677685950413223
8521567,3,B007RX9WRK,"Parker Posey stars as a somewhat pretentious guru/ life guide on a reality TV show. In her show she comes into people's lives, burns their belongings, turns them vegan and has them meditate. Crystals, pyramids, and alpha waves are all part of the mix. Al (Jay Harrington) and Millie (Christy Scott Cashman) are free range chicken farmers. When the DMF shuts down Al's job as a lobster fisherman, Millie gets offered a paid opportunity to be on Parker Posey's program, ""Cut the Crap.""

As it turns out Millie and the farming life lacks drama, so the produces decide to create their own. Unfortunately the show was too predictable for me to feel any drama. Kathryn Erbe plays Millie's sister who wants to be photographed. The humor in the show was showing Posey being a free spirit, running around in a circle with her arms extended saying things like, ""If it's white, don't bite"" or ""there is no place like Om."" Millie gets lines like telling her son to ""stop choking the chicken."" There should have been more of a give and take between the two women. The movie is about how these two opposites become sisters on a higher plane, reach an understanding and influence each others life. Unfortunately the writing and editing didn't deliver this film as well as it should. More of a ""chick"" flick.

Original title: ""Sunny Side Up.""

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, sex, or nudity.",1344297600,2,1371,4.7280334728033475
