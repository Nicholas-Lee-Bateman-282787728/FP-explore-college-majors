8489902,3,B005ZOW1QC,"633 Squadron, 1964 film

This is a story about the strategic bombing operation in WW II. There is one plant in Norway that manufactures the fuel for Nazi rocket launchers that will be aimed at England before the invasion of France. If it is destroyed the rocket launchers will be useless. The 633 Squadron is composed of Moquitoes, a fast and light bomber with two liquid-cooled engines. It is mostly built out of wood to minimized the need for scarce metals. This has the usual drama of personal conflicts (needed to add interest in most movies). The Norwegian resistance will play a part in the attack. They reported an increase of German troops and anti-aircraft guns. The Mosquitoes practice bombing the side of a mountain; this will create a landslide that will bury the fuel factory in Norway. We see a surprise attack on the airfield by enemy fighters. [No radar warning?]

The airmen talk in a public house. A young woman enters and attracts attention; she is the sister of one of the crew. [No accents?] Practice bombing continues. Inattention to details results in one fatal accident. The Norwegian will return to gather more men for the operation. Is the leader of the operation too valuable to risk? Tin cans are tied to the rear of one automobile in celebration of a wedding. [Do they still do that today?] That Norwegian officer parachutes into Norway. Enemy troops search the area. A truck carries armed men past a checkpoint, they are pursued by the enemy. One man is captured! Back in England an airman explains why he joined the Eagle Squadron [Americans who volunteered to fly for Britain]. The capture could imperil the operation! Should one man be sacrificed in order to save the operation? This is one of the trade-offs that occur not just in war. [A cutback in personnel to save the business? This is usually due to error in management.]

Eric Bergman is again questioned but has nothing to say. Can he be ""persuaded"" to talk? Will that lone bomber accomplish its mission? It returns, damaged. They use the emergency exit to rescue the pilot. Was the mission accomplished? The operation will be moved up just in case. Eric's sister accepts the decision. The special bombs are delivered. The flight plan is reviewed. The Norwegian underground will attack the anti-aircraft batteries before the bombers arrive. What if something goes wrong? There is no radio message from the Norwegian resistance! What will the flight commander do? Is their low-level flight under the radar? They drop their bombs and report the results. Will it be a success? [A happy ending is needed for commercial success.]

You can compare this 1964 movie to the ones made during the war for their outlook (which should match the audiences' expectations.)",1516752000,,2748,4.865384615384615
