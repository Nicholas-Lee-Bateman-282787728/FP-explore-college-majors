7912403,5,B00000JKNU,It is a surprisingly good DVD. I have regular DVD player hook up with HDMI to 1080 HDTV. Great visual quality. It is way better watch Su27 flies at full screen size than majority of YouTube videos. $5 ish include shipping. it totally worth to be as a collection item. A lot of closed up detail like we are on site of a airshow.,1321228800,,327,4.125
7912404,2,B00000JKNU,"The Sukhoi Su-27 in my opinion is one of the most beatiful modern jet aircraft ever designed.  I've been wanting to get a video of this aircraft for some time.  This one was very disappointing.  It was filmed at an airshow with a hand held video camera.  Lots of jerky filming with the plane moving in and out of the frame and zoomed in on jet flying so you can't see the whole plane in the frame.  There is no narration. There was some air to air filming, but again, the camera appeared to be hand held.  Although the camera work was poor, the picture quality was good.  I didn't pay much for this dvd.  If I had I would be greatly upset.",1242086400,,639,4.138211382113822
7912405,3,B00000JKNU,"What this is is a DVD about a plane.  More specifically, a DVD about a plane that's quite clearly aimed at the modelmaker rather than the general aviation enthusiast.
Plot?  Hah.  It's not even a documentary - it's just several sequences of film of Flankers flying.  In fact it looks as though it may be several shorter films joined together.  Midway through it credits two Japanese narrators - despite the fact that there's been no narration and the only soundtrack is jet noise and some rather variable music.
Even the aerobatics enthusiast is going to feel short-changed - yes, you get to see some of the incredible feats of which the Flanker is capable, but they're usually shot from so close in you either can't tell what is going on at all, or can only guess what's happening by watching how the plane moves in relation to the light cloud cover.  In some of the less obvious cases they show you archive footage of the same manouever from a better angle, just so you know what you couldn't quite see.
OK, that's the negative.  On the positive side, the picture's beautifully clear and sharp, and the color looks very natural.  There's a lot that suggests its been filmed with the modeler in mind - in addition to a lot of the flying sequences following the plane closely, we're treated to long, slow closeups of stuff like ejector seats, instrument panels and wheel wells.  At least, I hope that's what it suggests - maybe there's a cult of wheelwell fetishists out there, or something.  Regardless, if you're planning to model the Su-27, there's lots of closeup detail.
Definitely very much a specialist DVD of the variety that, if you're not in the target audience, makes watching paint dry look like an extreme sport.  However, if you're in the target audience, the footage here is potentially at least as useful as many of the more pictorial books on Flankers out there.",1036281600,5,1879,4.680851063829787
7912406,2,B00000JKNU,"I bought this DVD because I am a big fan of russian fighter jets especially the flanker series. The DVD covers a trip made by the Su27 and Su30 to the US during the cold war, with the Su27 being piloted by Viktor Pugachev. What disappointed me was the photography. The cameras are always on high zoom, which doesn't allow the aerobatic manuver's to be fully appreciated. There is no commentary at any time during the video to explain the manuver's or cockpit instruments etc.
However, it is still a decent buy for the flanker fan.",1031356800,2,530,4.53125
7912407,5,B00000JKNU,"There are few planes in the sky that are as versatile and remarkable as the Suchoi 27 and variants (NATO reporting name is Flanker, Russian pilots call it ""Crane""), and this film answers all questions about what this jet is capable of, including footage of the original master pilot who created the ""Cobra"" maneuver, performing it for the cameras. A must for fans who would like a closer look at what this incredible jet is capable of. For fellow modelers, this film has close up shots of the cockpit, wheel bays, exhausts, etc, proving a mine of information for a correct scale representation of the original. The film definitely does this plane justice.",1015027200,4,655,4.8053097345132745
7912408,5,B00000JKNU,"This is one of the best movie about the Russian SU-27 flanker,to be true I like this dvd bec its full of information about this plane. In thios video you can see some of the best performance being done while in the air. The detail about thios plane is very good. For those who are fond of Russian planes I highly recommend this dvd.",986947200,4,332,4.203125
