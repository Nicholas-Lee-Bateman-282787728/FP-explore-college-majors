695909,5,6303651941,"Really good movie about a robot who is protecting a woman from a group of mercenaries in a big building. This robot developped a sort of virus who made him feel more like a human. By the way,  it's wonderfully played by  Olivier Gruner who has this sweet voice (with a little french accent) and a  sentimental side of his personnality that nobody else does. Also, his  performance is amazing.",947376000,2,392,4.557142857142857

7852094,3,6303651941,"Still relatively fresh into his film career in 1995, Olivier Gruner courted the sci-fi genre by starring in his second derivative of robot movie following the superior&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Nemesis/dp/B00122M238/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Nemesis</a>. ""Automatic"" here possesses a strong cast and decent fight scenes but fails to sustain a mild level of interestingness, making for a tolerable flick that never had a chance of becoming a classic.

The story: after a prototype Automatic (Gruner) - a cyborg engineered for home defense - accidentally murders the company owner while protecting a woman (Daphne Ashbrook,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Doctor-Who-The-Movie/dp/B0049S1NYG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Doctor Who: The Movie</a>), the two of them are locked in the company headquarters while two teams of mercenaries are sent in to eliminate them.

If you've seen any other low-budget sci-fi action movies from the 80s or mid-90s, chances are you already have an idea of what this one looks like. This is one of the films where a basic industrial design is shorthand to signify high tech and futuristic. The colorless, shadowy set design occasionally make this one depressing to look at, though some redemption arrives in the form of interesting special effects and prosthetics. However, the dramatic content is way livelier than anything the production design has to offer: the cast is loaded with supporting stars just hamming it up, including John Glover (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Smallville/dp/B0001JXPPC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Smallville</a>) as the megalomanic engineer, Jeff Kober (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/China-Beach/dp/B00D2UMHVA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">China Beach</a>) as the evil merc leader, Troy Evans (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/ER/dp/B00FOGH2RY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">ER</a>) as the blue collar security chief, and the late Stanley Kamel (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Monk/dp/B003WVJ65Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Monk</a>) as the doomed CEO. Nobody will win any awards for this flick, but they'll all keep you from getting too bored.

The movie's take on cyborgs is kind of unique and definitely silly: a more modern counterpart might be the Unisols of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/most-recent-Universal-Soldier-flick/dp/B00A34LX9A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">most recent Universal Soldier flick</a>, with cyborg Olivier being just about as frail as regular humans but able to heal himself in short order, and with the inconvenient ability to develop emotions out of the blue (the film treats these as a virus that is able to ""infect"" other cyborgs). As strange of a character as this makes for, Gruner's fight scenes are more solid. There ought to definitely be more of them, but the handful of scenes wherein he beats down multiple attackers using a combination of karate and aikido are roundly worth waiting for. Disappointingly, he has no good individual opponents to go one-on-one with: Marjean Holden (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballistic/dp/6303356567/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballistic</a>) appears as a mercenary but doesn't get into any real fights and Jeff Kober isn't really compelling as a hand-to-hand fighter.

There are some cool/absurd bits, like when Olivier blows up a combat helicopter with a single bullet and then defies physics by turning a freefall down an elevator chute into a spider climb. Some more of these instances would have made for a more compelling movie, but as is, they're just high points in a film that could have been more exciting. Luckily, it's a fairly short flick at under 90 minutes of runtime, so even the snootiest viewers should be able to sit through it. Know yourself before you buy this one.",1401753600,,4045,6.626415094339623

7852096,5,6303651941,"Automatic is an excellent film! It has a futuristic plot & a twist at the end. Loved it! Not to mention, Olivier Gruner is so handsome and has a very likeable character. He's very protective. I bought this film as soon as I found it on amazon; too bad it isn't available on DVD, at least not that I could find.
Anyway, I highly recommend it!",1250640000,,341,4.181818181818182
7852097,1,6303651941,This Automatic not the Olivier Gruner movie. Although it comes up in a search for his name.,1211846400,3,91,4.411764705882353
7852098,2,6303651941,"The plot, was interesting and a good idea. The details of the characters were a bit too sterotyped and over the top to equal the plot. Some of the behaviors of the characters were so overblown as to be unbelivable. Too bad. If the writters had spent a couple more weeks on the script this could have been a four star movie. As for the acting, Olivier Gruner and his female co-lead were actually quite good, considering their parts. My biggest complaint with the film is that it was shot in half light and shadows for 90% of the movie making it difficult to clearly follow the action. There was no reason for this, if they had shot it in regular lighting it would easily have added another one star to the review. Half the time you couldn't clearly see who was doing what to whom. Couldn't they afford the electric bill? Bottom line, this is a movie that could have been significantly better than it turned out if they had taken a little more time and simply turned the lights on.",1186185600,,979,4.384615384615385
7852099,2,6303651941,"After watching this movie, I felt a bit cheated. I'm a big fan of Olivier Gruner and I liked him in Nemesis, but Automatic is nowhere near the film that Nemesis is. Yes, Gruner plays the man/machine character very well, but even he can't save this film. I'm not real finicky about film details but this one is  definitely not a 4 star film by ANY stretch of the imagination. The film's imagery consisted mainly of closeup shots of prop machine guns going off and sequences of bad guys' hands pulling grenade pins. The film's dialog was about as engaging as it's imagery. Even when playing the man/machine guy in other films, Gruner is still able to add depth and humanness to the character. However, he was not able to achieve this in Automatic. Blame it on poor writing, poor directing, or whatever. I'm still a fan of Olivier Gruner but this film just doesn't have it.",969494400,,870,4.54140127388535
7852100,5,6303651941,"This is one of the most underrated movies of our time.  Granted it falls into the somewhat overdone genre of cyborg action films, it's still fun to  watch.
An automatic is a personal defense unit, part human part machine,  which is manufactured to protect its owner and uphold the law.  They all  talk, look and act the same (like Olivier Gruner).  By the way, this is  probably Olivier's best film.  This role suits him perfectly.
The  problem:  the company that manufactures automatics is about to have a  billion dollar loan recalled unless it comes up with something new.  A day  before a major press conference, a company supervisor attempts to rape Nora  (an employee).  In his attempt to protect her, an ""Automatic""  accidentally kills the supervisor.
To avoid a scandal, the company head  hires a hit squad to kill the offending Automatic and Nora.  Of course,  this Automatic is anything but helpless.  Here the action starts and never  lets up.
To my suprise, something of a romance develops between Nora and  this Automatic who, like the Tin Man in Wizard of Oz, is in search of his  heart.  To my even greater surprise, the romance part of this story  actually works.
With action, romance, great villains and a surprise plot  twist, Automatic has become one of my personal favorite films, along with  Terminator and Robocop.  Enjoy.",966729600,8,1344,4.827433628318584
7852101,4,6303651941,"True, this is a ""dark"" film, in terms of lighting, anyway, but for an action/futuristic flick it's original and well done. The fact that the hero is a robot is refreshing since it finally explains why the heroes  of action films tend to be monotone and one-dimensional. Pay attention to  Jeff Kober and Marjean Holden (Philadelphia Experiment II) in this film,  they make it worthwile if you like sleek, sexy bad guys who have more  character than the leading man and lady. Rent this film just to check them  out together. Makes you curious to know what they got up to in Bolivia.  Ding-a-ling-a-ling, darlin'.",953856000,,610,4.761904761904762
