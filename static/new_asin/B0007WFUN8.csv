2246291,2,B0007WFUN8,"This film history is very incomplete particularly since it was made in 2005.  It only began to whet my apetite for more, especially about the western US stadiums.  It completely neglected to tell the story of Candlestick, Dodger Stadium, the LA Memorial Coliseum and Chase Field (the first that used retractable roofs so that real grass could be grown in an air conditioned space).  This should be titled ""Eastern United States Baseball Parks"".",1245801600,,444,5.054794520547945
2246292,4,B0007WFUN8,"If you love the history of this sport, it's good to see the ballparks that may not be around in 20 years from now.",1242604800,,114,3.7916666666666665
2246293,5,B0007WFUN8,"Even though it's out of date already, this is the history of baseball stadiums from the beginning.  Released before the new Giants ballpark in San Francisco was finished, it nonetheless covers this aspect of the game thoroughly, from the grass fields and standing crowds in the 1800's, through the wood and later steel structures of the early 1900's to the cookie-cutter dual-purpose stadia of the 70s and the renaissance in design started at Camden Yards in Baltimore, this is the best, albeit probably the only, history of its kind available on video.",1231632000,,553,5.010869565217392
2246294,3,B0007WFUN8,"Since it is in the series of Modern Marvels, I expect, at the beginning, to see the technology building the ball parks. It is, however, not what contents in this film. The main theme is the evolution of the ball parks from 19th century to the present. Of course, it is good to know why a ball park shapes like that, why is it situated at the outskirt of the city, and why it moves back to the heart of the city. Through the film, I just feel it misses something, perhaps many. For example, memorable moments, HOFers or teams with that park are worthy of mentioning.

Like many DVD's of the THC, I always feel the running time is too short and I just grab the surface. This film is no exception. Every time when I begin to feel interested in what they mention, it just finishes and jumps to another. I'd like to see this topic addressed again in another DVD.",1169596800,20,857,4.257668711656442

8052647,5,B0007WFUN8,I use this DVD in my Sport Facilites undergraduate class at the University of Kansas. It probides an excellent overview of the evolution of ballparks in America from the late 1800's until our current venues. Just superb.,1362700800,,220,4.972972972972973
8052648,4,B0007WFUN8,"If you ever wanted to visit ballparks, but never had the chance, this is it. The History Channel takes you to old and new ballparks and gives you some history of each venue in an exciting tour around the country at baseball's great palaces.",1359417600,,240,4.4772727272727275
8052649,2,B0007WFUN8,"A brief, interesting, informative survey of the history of ballparks from 18th century sandlots to the planned construction of AT&T Park. Although it is well-organized, it needs more depth. Ken Burns' ""Baseball: The Tenth Inning"", has a fascinating section with a Fenway Park tour guide. ""Ballparks"" could have benefited from that kind of approach, as well as more memorable photos, as in the ""Take Me Out To The Ballpark"" wall calendar. I also wanted to know more about HOK Sports and memorable moments in the various parks. It needed more. By the way, my disc had no closed captioning.",1327017600,,587,4.9393939393939394
8052650,1,B0007WFUN8,"Basically, all this DVD is is the History Channel's ""Modern Marvels"" episode of Baseball Parks. That's it. No extras at all.

You'd think with a juicy topic as this you'd get inside tours of ballparks, maybe some interviews with architects (hey, how about a whole featurette on HOK Sports which designed most of the retro ballparks of today?) even some photo galleries of ballparks.

The show takes you up to the point where the San Francisco's Pac Bell (AT&T or whatever they call it now) Park is in the building stages so it's not really all that up to date.

A very poor release that adds zero to the original TV show broadcast.",1322524800,,631,4.566371681415929
8052651,5,B0007WFUN8,"History Channel has done it again! Excellent!  Now with all the NEW ballparks, I just hope another DVD is made in the near future.",1276300800,,130,4.416666666666667

8052653,4,B0007WFUN8,"If you a a baseball fan and a history geek then you'll really like this.  Growing up in the here and now I can appreciate all the stories my dad told me about watching the Dodgers ""Where They Belong"" in Brooklyn.  It also helps understand how much baseball has grown over the last century.  But with all the business that's involved now, to me it's still a game to love.",1256428800,,370,4.257142857142857
