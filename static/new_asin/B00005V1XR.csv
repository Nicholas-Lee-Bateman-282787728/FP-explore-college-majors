7955858,3,B00005V1XR,"Just o.k.
I was hoping for good examples of different kinds of dance moves. For instance, I would have liked to see the teacher show the kids first how it is done at adult level then have kids follow along at kid level. This taught some moves but not well enough for my 2 and 5 year-old boys to actually follow along consistantly.",1283299200,,330,4.253968253968254
7955859,3,B00005V1XR,"I got this for my ballerina's fourth birthday, and she liked it ok.  She doesn't beg me to watch it.  It might be better for a younger child.  The music and presentation are geared toward younger kids.  I'm also not sure my daughter really learned any dance moves, but I'm also not sure how well she payed attention.  The filming is kind of bad, not that my little girl would care about that, but it is a little painful for me to watch (not that I really would).  I think a one to three year old would enjoy this video very much.",1252713600,,529,4.137254901960785
7955860,5,B00005V1XR,Product was as expected and arrived very promptly.  Granddaughter is very happy to dance to the video. It will provide many hours of entertainment and a very good way to begin her dance experience as she is only 2 years old. I would buy from this seller again.,1233187200,,260,4.416666666666667
7955861,3,B00005V1XR,"We had rented this video from the library about a year ago, since then we have moved to a country were libraries are not available to us.  We find that we missed this video and wanted to see it again.  It's in endearing little show that helps body shy children focus of themselves and think about the gentley adminstrated dance moves.",986774400,,334,4.459016393442623
