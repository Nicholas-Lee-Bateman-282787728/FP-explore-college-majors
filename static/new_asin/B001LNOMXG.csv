8319085,3,B001LNOMXG,"This brisk programmer from poverty row studio Chesterfield is a compact murder/comedy with lots of fine performances.

Patricia Farr plays Mamie Murphy, a manicurist whose name is read as one of the winners of a horse-race sweepstakes. Almost immediately she's courted by a parade of wealthy older men including nightclub owner Tony Morelli (Duncan Renaldo) and society gent Jack Conroy (Jameson Thomas). When Mamie is invited to stay at a swanky new penthouse apartment as part of the publicity for her win, fame takes another turn entirely when she awakens one day to find the dead body of Conroy...and a smoking gun in her hand...

LADY LUCK (1936) is actually more of a romantic screwball comedy than anything else. The murder aspect is treated almost like an incidental part of the plot and only occurs 15 minutes before the end of the film! The writing is crisp and the performances are suitably lightweight. Patricia Farr (a second-string Barbara Stanwyck type) is charming in the lead role of Mamie.",1263340800,,1007,4.988095238095238
