1691166,3,B000063S6M,"I'm a big fan of the Brainy Baby DVD series after purchasing both Left and Right Brain for my 21 month old son.  He loved both of those and thought we should move to the ABC DVD.  He already knew the entire alphabet at 18 months.  This video has a lengthy song in the middle that seems to be just filler to hit the 45 minute mark.  For the most part, my son loves the letter parts, but loses interest in the songs.  Certainly not a regretable purchase but this DVD does lack some creative elements that were in Left and Right Brain.",1077580800,4,532,4.12621359223301
1691167,5,B000063S6M,"I love this Brainy Baby video! (After owning both, I think BB is much better than Baby Einstein.)
My 19th month old son knows a lot of his letters thanks to this video! He LOVES it and begs to watch it all day. He doesn't like watching TV in general, so he's allowed to see ABC's at least once a day.
Just this week he held up a block with the letter M on it and said ""M"", and then did the same to two more blocks! It's amazing! Now he's pointing out letters in the words in his books and telling me what they are.
I know this is from watching the video, as well as reading with our family.
I HIGHLY recommend this video, as well as 123, Animals, and Shapes and Colors. All are excellent.
The Brainy Baby people know what they're doing.",1074297600,4,736,4.0479452054794525
1691168,3,B000063S6M,"If you don't already own left brain and right brain, I would recommend getting those first. Though, this one is meant for older children, but it is not quite as entertaining it seems. My child doesn't seem to respond to this one as much as the left and right brain DVDs. If you already own left and right brain, it is still a worthwhile purchase.",1061856000,,346,4.338461538461538
1691169,5,B000063S6M,"I love the way this video balances structured lessons like I would do myself with my child, and more abstract scenes of children playing with large letters and having great fun.  It covers large and small letters.  It also reviews words starting with certain letters, demonstrates sounding out words, and shows the word onscreen to help a child develop reading skills.  And unlike many others out there, they take the time to go over the different sounds that one letter can make.  This helps a child be more clear about how to learn to read.  There are lots of outdoor scenes and lots of children from different ethnic groups, and great animations too.  I love these 45-minute videos!",1044144000,3,685,4.762711864406779
1691170,5,B000063S6M,"This is a wonderful video. It REALLY teaches your child the alphabet! All the Brainy Baby videos do a far better job in teaching. ... The Brainy Baby series is most certainly worth the investment. ...If your child watches Brainy Baby, they actually LEARN their ABC's, 123's, Colors, etc. as well as being entertained with BEAUTIFUL images! (Not to mention that Brainy Baby is 50% longer than Einstein for the same price). Brainy Baby has not only taught our 17 month old daughter the ENTIRE alphabet, but it has been a lifesaver for my sanity too!

It drew my daughter in because the children are happily doing things that all children love to do, play in water, play on the playground, etc. The review of numbers 1-10 is quick and then we pause for a jumping around, danceable song and then its on to numbers 11-20.

1691215,5,B000063S6M,This a great tool when it comes to helping your child with the alphabet. Within a few days of playing this DVD my daughter learned several letters.  She loves the songs they incorporate in the DVD. I love how clear everything is so it makes it very easy for her to understand and learn. My daughter is currently 21 months and I think by 24 months she will know the whole alphabet song. I highly recommend this DVD and this is coming from an individual that does not allow her child to watch tv.,1373500800,,494,4.25531914893617

1691217,3,B000063S6M,"It is boring and slow. My toddler sometimes interacts with it but most of the time as soon as I put it on she goes and tries to find something else to do. I like that it has the repeat play, and that you can get it for a low price.",1363564800,,231,3.549019607843137
1691218,5,B000063S6M,"After reading some of the negative reviews, I wanted to add my thoughts to the discussion.  I am personally very happy with this DVD.  Though nothing can replace one on one interaction with your kid, I believe this DVD does an excellent job of supplementing their learning of the alphabet.  It not flashy or gimmicky, but just a simple presentation of the alphabet and the pronouncation of the letter and words associated with it.  As others have stated, pretty boring for the parents...though I watch it with my child and go through the DVD with her by asking her what this or that is and repeating along.  Based on my personal experience, I believe my child has benefited greatly from this DVD...she can point out and spell all the letters in random order.  I will be using this DVD for my 2nd child also.  Thank you, Brainy Baby!",1322006400,2,832,4.581081081081081
1691219,4,B000063S6M,"The product is okay quality (better visually than the dated ""Your Baby Can Read"" series) and it holds my baby's attention.  He's fairly picky.  It teaches both uppercase and lowercase letters and the phonics sounds for each letter.  My baby's favorite video (which is genius) is the Leapfrog Letter Factory.  But since we can't play that same video all day everyday, this one is good to alternate and he still likes it although it's much less punchy and cutesy.",1286409600,,461,4.7974683544303796
1691220,5,B000063S6M,"I bought this movie for my oldest daughter when she was a little over a year old.  Both my daughters learned their letters and beginning phonics from this movie.  It works very well.  By the time my oldest was two, she knew all the letters and the sounds they make.  Both my daughters started reading at four-years-old and could read chapter books like the Magic Tree House Series when they were in Kindergarten.  I am purchasing the same DVD for my one-year-old son because we lost this movie during a move.  The person who painstakingly transcribed the DVD needs to get a life.  This movie really does work.",1273536000,,609,4.583333333333333
1691221,4,B000063S6M,"The negative posters definitely hit the mark regarding some of the flaws in the video. 'P' prounounced 'Puh' could be troubling to some, but on the other hand how clearly does your child pronounce their alphabet and how hard is it to clarify a mispronunciation? The value of this video is how it introduces the letters and associates them with objects. The more my child sees that 'Ape' 'ant' and 'apple' share a common thread, the more they learn. Will they learn the alphabet perfectly from this video? Not likely, but they are learning. Well, mine is. She (20 months) LOVES this video and surprises us each day with how many new words she's picked up from it. I will trouble her later about why the object you see from in your head is spelled ""E-Y-E"" rather than ""I"", why 'g' and 'j' switch roles for no good reason other than historic precedent, whether 'c' or 'k' should probably be eliminated entirely, why 'c' sometimes wants to be an 's', and why we name our letters with 'e' or 'a' at the end of some 'eh' at the beginning of others or with sounds that have nothing to do with the phonetic pronunciation of the letter (h = aych) rather than one consistent sound at the beginning or end of all (e.g. bah, cah, dah, fah, gah, hah, jah, lah, mah, nah, pah, qwah, rah, sah, tah, vah, wah, yah, zah). Until that time this video is a great starter that she enjoys and is learning from. I haven't seen anything better.",1268611200,,1420,4.423664122137405

He's learning from this DVD along with me going over flashcards all the time with him.  It's never too early.  The 123 does not keep his attention at all.  Its kind of boring.

1691223,1,B000063S6M,"The title should read ""ABCs"" and not ""ABC's"". Plural does not require an apostrophe.

1691225,5,B000063S6M,"The Brainy Baby ABCs video is absolutely the BEST!  I would give ALL Brainy Baby DVDs 5 stars. These videos really work, I don't care what anyone says and I've got the proof in my own children. Don't believe all the reports that ""DVDs are bad"" for your kids. There is GOOD stuff out there and Brainy Baby is definitely one of them. I am very concerned about some of these negative reviews. Please, already... are you kidding? I have not found ANY problems or mispronunciations in the ABCs video or any other video. Also, concerning the one reviewer that said she personally didn't like the video or that it didn't have high production value... It's not about you. It's about your child. If your child learns from these DVDs, then who cares if YOU like it or not? A two or three year old is also not impressed with high production value (special effects, talent, etc). That's what I love about Brainy Baby; they have a pure, simple approach to learning that really engages my children. That is why I get the learning results. For those people who would continue to be negative, please do not assume that your comments are correct and pass them off to consumers as the truth. You are only confusing parents and short-changing children from a huge benefit. Brainy Baby products are fantastic and a real life saver. Unless you plan on producing the ""perfect"" DVD, please don't spread untruths, just because a certain product doesn't line up with your preference. We should all be supporting companies like this that are doing a good thing for our kids... unless we all want to see LESS products available in the near future!",1257292800,,1620,4.644599303135888
1691226,4,B000063S6M,"My 22 mo son loves this DVD; he is really not interested in TV at all but will sit & watch this in entirety.  Priced much better than popular competitor's ""educational"" DVDs and my son enjoys it more.  He loves seeing other children in the show and hearing children's voices.  Quite boring for Mom & Dad; let's face it, we know the alphabet so its no suspense movie.  But son loves it and is learning alphabet, letter recognition, and names of various objects - so it's worth a little parental boredom.",1256688000,,502,4.483516483516484
1691227,1,B000063S6M,"Parents please be aware that many studies show that the more television children under five watch the less likely they are to engage in creative play. (DVDS being basically the same thing).

 Dimitri Christakis the director of the Child Health Institute at the University of Washington quoted in the book Parenting Inc, states: ""Based on the research I have done there is reason to believe these products (DVDs for babies and toddlers) have a deleterious  (negative) effect on the developing mind"" , ""TV, DVDS and video games condition the developing brain to expect a very high, unnatural level of input. Real life by comparison becomes boring"".

Another quote, again from Parenting Inc."" ""There is no research to show that watching a screen is beneficial to a baby in any way, educational or otherwise. If anything it may be putting babies at risk"" ""A two dimensional screen can never replace a real environment, rich in all five senses. Holistic play is what  develops the all the pathways to the brain."" Alvin Poussaint, child psychiatrist  and director of the Media Center of Judge Baker's Children Center in Boston.

Please be aware that the fact is The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children under two be kept away from screen media. These products are claiming benefits that are utterly unfounded.

Please think twice about buying DVDS for a baby or toddler. Do the research, it's not a good idea. Stick to the old fashioned toys that engage kids in creative play - blocks, balls etc.",1253750400,4,1509,4.936758893280633
1691228,5,B000063S6M,"I like that this DVD goes through the alphabet a few blocks of letters at a time. It will go through, say, ""A"" through ""E"", and then go back over them again before moving on. It helps with learning, and it also gives you a place to stop and resume later if you have a toddler that can't sit through the whole alphabet. I also like that they always show the capital and lowercase of each letter (big A"", little ""a""). It's a good video to watch along with reading books like Dr. Seuss' alphabet book. My son is 22 months old and can recognize and say every letter, upper and lowercase. We also got the Sesame Street letters DVD, and he has fun pointing to the letters we have on his wall in his room as well--it's like a game to him.",1251417600,,731,4.118881118881119
1691229,5,B000063S6M,"My daughter loved this dvd at 12 months and kind of grew out of it at 2 but still asks for it occasionally.  She has learned the alphabet due to this dvd, I was so amazed when she would tell me letters that I hadn't taught her myself.",1239408000,,234,3.875
1691230,5,B000063S6M,"As a speech pathologist, I would highly reccomend this video to any of my clients. To those that have said the phonemes are incorrect have obviously never worked with speech challenged toddlers. There are lots of videos out on the market that encourage children to memorize their ABC's (which in the long run will not benefit their ability to read or spell). I encourage my students as well as my own child to address the sounds of letters first and label them later. I am very impressed that they include the different sounds the vowels (/oe/ and /o/)make and that they review (for those children that need it). To those reviewers who adressed the ""uh"" they heard attached to sounds - vowels for children under the age of five often need to be pronounced emphatically so they say them correctly (when learning the individual sounds). You can fix the attached ""uh"" later when spelling and blending words together. Also the vocabulary that follows the pronunciation of the letters encourages against using the ""uh"". I have not found a video like this one that teaches the ABC sounds and letters.",1226620800,10,1094,4.7936507936507935
1691231,5,B000063S6M,"After reading a few negative reviews of this product, I had concerns about purchasing it.  However, I couldn't find any alternatives that I thought would help reinforce my 3-yr-old twins' interest in letters so I took a chance.  I am so glad I did!

The video introduces capital and lower case letters along with the sounds and somehow manages to capture my boys' attention whenever I turn it on.  It is interesting to both of them, despite their very different abilities (one has known the alphabet since he was 18 months and the other still doesn't know all the letters).

My opinion is that the concerns of the reviewer(s) who complained about the pronunciations like, ""d-uh"" are overstated.  It is a great tool for learning the alphabet and sounds!",1201910400,2,752,4.790697674418604

After reading all the reviews, I decided to purchase this DVD for our 20 month old son.  He had been watching The Letter Factory (which is great) and I wanted to offer him something new. At first, I was worried, as he wanted to watch The Letter Factory, but after sitting through the DVD with him ONCE, from then on, he has been very interested in watching the video.  I like it because it's not all hyper.  It's taught in a relaxed calm method.  No regrets.  I LOVE the way they repeat over and over the sounds of the letters.  It's an excellent video for learnig the alphabet and letter sounds. A++++ We bought ours directly from Brainy Baby.  We didn't want to wait.

She is correct about the ""uh"" sound, but my son has started talking so much since we got this dvd from our local library. He has even started saying complete sentances! Brainy Baby may not be perfect, but they are obviously doing something right. He also watches it from beginning to end without getting bored, and even giggles when the babies giggle. It is very cute! I think they did a great job. We have to remember that this video was made for babies and toddlers, not grown up adults.",1156377600,,646,4.436974789915967
1691246,4,B000063S6M,"This review was very difficult for me to write as I have mixed feelings toward the video. As a first grade teacher, I am very critical of anything that requires the very particular and accurate use of phonemic awareness. Unfortunately, as the mom in the last review pointed out, this video has many inconsistencies when the narrator and little girl say their letter sounds. First of all, when saying letter sounds, one NEVER wants to add the sound -uh after any letter!! For example, when saying the sound for ""T"" we don't say ""TUH"", we simply whisper it by dropping our tougue from the roof to the bottom of our mouth. Or, we say ""W"" not by saying ""WUH"" but by forming the W with our lips, then holding the W sound like www[...] Though most of the sounds in this video are correct, they occasionally slip into the ""-uh"" trap! How on earth are our children supposed to read if they add -uh to every consonant....tell me....for instance, what the heck is puh-a-tuh! (translation without the -uh and you get the word ""pat""!)

Now, looking beyond the inconsistencies in pronounciation, I have to say that my 2 year old son LOVES the video!!! I am completely in awe and amazed that within one time of watching it, he repeats EVERY letter as it drops onto the screen. Though I find it terribly repetitive and boring, he is COMPLETELY engrossed!! And you know, HE IS the one who is supposed to love the video (not me!) so I suppose Brainy Baby has hit the mark on that aspect! He sits through the seven minute introduction and is totally aware as each written letter comes on. He enjoys the kids and babies on the screen and it doesn't seem to bother him that there is no real ""action"" or fun puppets like they have in the Baby Einstein videos. So, as a mother, I am overjoyed that he is enjoying the video, learning his letters AND gaining a nice vocabulary. He is slightly speech delayed, so anything that will help to improve his language awareness is a blessing.

So how do I rate this?? As a teacher, probably no more than a 3. As a mother, I'd have to give this a 5 since my own child is rapidly developing his language awareness just by watching a simple DVD! I haven't watched any other letters video, so if anyone has any suggestions, I'd love to hear them!",1144195200,44,2260,4.430288461538462
1691247,5,B000063S6M,"Believe it!... This is a great video. Brainy Baby just seems to really know how to connect with children when it comes to teaching. The lady who gave this a one star and wrote a book about her feelings, is a bit over the top and has way too much time on her hands. We also homeschool our children and found that this video really helped them when they were younger to learn the alphabet. Remember, this is a PRESCHOOL video! Your children are being introduced to learning situations, not studying for a college exam! We have found that all the Brainy Baby videos are top quality and do an excellent job of teaching. Our boys knew the entire upper /lower case and all the letter sounds around 16-18 months! It was amazing and I KNOW that these videos played a big part in that. I am also impressed that all of their videos have a very specific educational outline that all my teacher friends say is excellent for teaching preschoolers. After doing a little research, I found a little known fact that it was Brainy Baby that created the first set of ""infant-preschool"" videos over 10 years ago (way before the Einstein series). So, that really gave me confidence that the producers at Brainy Baby really had the experience and track record. My advice, I don't see how you could go wrong for a mere $15 investment in your child's future. I own all of them and wish Brainy Baby would make more!",1141344000,7,1390,4.4763779527559056
1691248,4,B000063S6M,"I purchased this DVD for my son at Christmas.  He was 26 months old and has autism.  Up to this point, he only could say a couple of words.  He had shown interest in the alphabet, though.

When I first watched the DVD with him, I thought it was really dry and boring, and he hardly watched any of it.  BUT...then we played it a few more times and he started to show a lot of interest.  Soon he was saying many of the letters, and within a week knew the whole alphabet.  Two months later he is saying 25 words, and I think it all started with learning the alphabet!

Although I still don't think it is a very exciting video, and yes...some of the letters are not pronounced correctly...it has done a world of good for my son!",1138924800,5,724,4.121428571428571

I began introducing the alphabet to her at age 6 months, and she now knows the letters by name and can ""sing"" the ABC song.  I bought this to help reinforce her knowledge because I like that it starts out by singing the traditional ABC song several times, and then it goes into presenting each letter.  I also like that it shows real life images of children and other objects, and its not just a bunch of fanciful images set to classical music. At the end, they sing the ABC song one final time. I think this a great buy for teaching ABCs, its simple and its exactly how most people would teach it.",1137628800,7,746,4.195804195804196

I have allowed my baby to watch one Brainy Baby video per day since he was about 6 months old.  He loves them.  And I love being able to have a few minutes to clean my kitchen.  :)  As soon as the Brainy Baby theme music comes on he starts to smile.  He is captivated.  I like them much more than the Baby Einstein videos.

And the toys.......he LOVES them.  ""Hello, Brainy Baby!""  They are the most loved and most used toys in his toy box.  I have to keep an extra stash of batteries just to make sure that they are all working all the time.

Remember, this series is designed for the cognitive and learning skills of the 2-4 year old set, not an adult!  I have a 3.5 year old who barely sits still, yet the children and action in this video keep his attention.  Yes, there are instrumental and singing portions, but that is what kids love. I have several in this series and my kids love them all.  Both my kids learned their ABC's by watching this video (along with practicing with foam letters in the bathtub).  I find the Brainy Baby series to be much more educational than the Baby Einstein videos.  For those of you who feel your children have advanced beyond the Baby Einstein videos, I would highly recommend this series.  Great for the preschool age group.",1131148800,24,882,4.645161290322581
1691262,5,B000063S6M,My 20 month old son loves this DVD.  He has taken a real liking to the alphabet song and stays glued to the TV whenever this DVD is on.  He also recognizes the objects associated with each letter and likes to point out or sign (according to the ASL signs he's familiar with) the objects that he knows.  Good product!,1127347200,4,316,4.233333333333333

1691264,5,B000063S6M,"Well, I read the review from the woman that gave this video 1 star.  And I think she might be a little too critical.  I have to say though this video may not be good for older kids, but it really all depends on your child.  My daughter (20 mo. now) loves the Alphabet and Number DVD's from Brainy Baby.  I started teaching her A and B at about the same time she was learning to walk and talk and she learned the difference between them very quickly.  I started adding in a new letter every couple weeks and she learned fast.  When I got the DVD she knew A,B,C,D,  and E.  Then after watching the videos for about a month she knew all of her alphabet, (Meaning she could say and recognize them).  So I do think that having this video excellerated her learning.  Then the Number DVD she watched for a couple weeks and I have to say I was amazed that with in a couple weeks she could count to 10.  But she did display the interest in learning her alphabets and numbers before we had the video.  If your child looks interested in learning then it's quite possible this would be very helpful.  I would recomend this video for children who are 1 year to 2 and a half.  It's great to expose them to, but you have to remember that a lot of the work has to come from you.  However there is no guarantee that your child will love the videos as much as mine.  Children learn in different ways.  Mine just really learned fast with the help of this video.  If your like me, you might think it's worth a shot.  And if your baby doesn't like it, sell it or pass it on to a friend.  Chances are someone elses baby might benefit from it.",1124755200,9,1620,4.115015974440895
1691265,4,B000063S6M,"these brainy baby videos are great because they kind of pick up where the baby einstein leaves off meaning that they are geared along the same thought of learning the basic school/world skills as the einsteins but are for the older kids that are at school readiness. for example, my son already knew the alphabet but i bought this anyway and it really is improving his alphabet skills because the focus on word pronunciation using the alphabet, and also the lower/upper case difference, as well as vowel pronunciations. i recommend these videos in the brainy baby series to the older kids who may have outgrown the dvds or tapes which cover numbers 1-5, and primary colors, and the like",1118275200,2,686,4.773109243697479
1691266,1,B000063S6M,"I'm shocked that this video is getting so many stars.  It makes me wonder if the mom's have really listened to it.  Just a warning that this is probably my most critical review I've written and it is quite lengthy.  If you are considering buying Brainy Baby ABC's then I'd suggest you please read this.

As with the other Brainy Baby (I'll call them BB in the review) videos that I have viewed, there is a long introduction that takes 2 minutes and 15 seconds.  Then they sing the alphabet 3 times, once with a fish alphabet puzzle, then with wood letters and then a snake alphabet puzzle.  Then kids voices are heard reciting the alphabet.  This is followed by a long instrumental of kids at a playground, some of them holding foam letter pieces (this lasts 2 minutes and 8 seconds!  How can this hold a kids attention?).  I mean, get on with it already!!  Finally, 7 and 1/2 minutes into the video, they begin with the letter A.

In case you don't know this, BB was formerly Baby's First Impressions (BFI).  BFI has a Letters video and BB ABC's has many of the exact same things in it.  I think BB tried to improve upon BFI Letters by showing upper and lower case of each letter and by saying the letter sound.  For the vowels they say both the long and the short sound and they also give the two sounds for C  and G. Unfortunately they blew it, in my humble opinion, in not being consistent in their letter sounds and by adding that terrible sloppy ""uh"" sound to many of them.  This is really bad.  I am no expert, just stay-at-home mom homeschooling my kids.  I am teaching my 2nd child to read and over the years I have learned how to make the letter sounds and how not to make the letter sounds.  Before BB marketed this video they should have had some lessons.  More about this later.  But, first, lets start with how BB does the letters.  All the letters follow this same basic format.  Here is what is said for the letter A:

Big A.  Little a.

The letter A makes two sounds.

A, A, A, Ape.

A. Ape.

A. Acorn.

A. Acorn.

and Aaaaa, Aaaaa, Aaaaa (this, of course, is the short sound that's being said), Apple.

Aaaa. Apple.

Aaaa. Ants.  Amazing Ants.

OK.....sounds good, right?  I thought, ""hey, this is great that they added in the sounds of the letters.  This is better then Baby's First Impressions Letters.""

FYI, in BFI they said:

A.

A. Apple.

A. Apple.

A.

A. Airplane.

A. Airplane.

A.

A. Arm.

A. Arm.

A.

You can see that BB tried to improve on this.

Anyway, as the other letters were said I soon realized I was wrong about thinking this was an improvement.  There is a ladies voice that I will call the ""Narrator"" and also a young girls voice that I will call the ""Reviewer"".  The Narrator started saying the letter sounds correctly but then very quickly began saying the sounds wrong.  Some were questionable, such as saying ""kih"" for K and ""Nnnnih"" for N.  Most were much more obvious, like ""puh"" for P, ""tuh"" for T, ""vuh"" for V, etc.  This is so wrong!  It's a sloppy ""uh"" that is added to consonants.  No wonder there are so many kids in this country that have such a hard time learning to read.  If you teach a child that the letter P says ""puh"", how can they correctly sound out a word?  Let's take the word ""pat"" as an example.  A child would sound it out by saying, ""puh....aaaa....tuh (assuming they are taught that the letter T says ""tuh"".....which is wrong).  If they try to blend this together they'll come up with ""puh-a-tuh"".  How are they supposed to know that they change ""puh...aaaa...tuh"" miraculously into ""pat""?  It just boggles my mind!

As you can see, this really bothers me.  I don't understand why a company won't say the sounds of the letters properly before they put a video on the market that is supposed to teach kids the letter sounds.  Get it right first!  Try it right now for yourself.  How do you say letter sounds such as P, T, V, etc?  Think about it....it might take a bit of effort to *not* say that ""uh"" at the end of the letter.  For the letters P and T you say them quite short.  Cut them off before adding on that ""uh"" sound.  The letter V can be drawn out a little longer but you just say ""vvvvvv""  (like a vibrating sound) you should not say ""vuh"".  The letter H is almost like you hear your breath coming quietly out of your mouth (it's difficult to explain but I hope you understand what I mean), you don't say, ""huh"".  The only letter that you can properly say the ""uh"" sound is for the letter U.  To drive home the point a little further, we all know the sound for S.  It's like a snake saying, ""ssss"".  No one in their right mind would teach that sound as ""suh"".  So why not teach all of the letter sounds properly?  OK....off my soap box a little bit....but not all the way.  I'm not done with reviewing this video.  It gets worse.

After every few letters there is a review.  Here's where it isn't even consistent!  The Narrator said ""Lih"" for the letter L.  This is also wrong.  You should say ""LLLL"" and not add on another sound to the end.  Then the Reviewer (the young girl) says, ""Luh.  LLLL.  Ladybug.  Luh.  LLLL.  Lamp.""  The Narrator says, ""That's right!!""  WHAT?  How can that be right?  They have just taught your child 3 different sounds for the letter L.  I don't know what school they went to!  First the Narrator says it wrong.  Then the Reviewer says it wrong (but a different wrong way) and then she actually says it right (LLLL) and then repeats herself (the wrong way and the right way, but both her sounds are different from the Narrators wrong sound).  How can this be considered ""right""??

Maybe by now you are thinking I am being way too picky, but think about it.  This is supposed to be teaching the impressionable little mind of our child.  Why have them view this and pick up the wrong way to say the sounds of the letters?  It could have a negative impact on them when they are ready to start to read.  Just *some* of the sounds said incorrectly by the girl Reviewer are: ""Buh"" for B, ""Kuh"" for C, ""Duh"" for D, ""Qwuh"" for Q, ""Vuh"" for V, ""Wuh"" for W, ""Ex"" for X, ""Yuh"" for Y.  In comparison, the adult Narrator says sounds like: ""Bih"" for B, ""Dih"" for D, ""Nih"" for N, ""Qwih"" for Q, ""Ur"" for R, ""Vih"" for V, ""Whih"" for W, ""Yih"" for Y, ""Zih"" for Z.  Both of them say about half of the alphabet incorrectly and it's not always the same letter.  Sometimes the girl says it right and the woman says the same letter wrong.  Sometimes they switch roles and the Reviewer gets it wrong and the Narrator says the same letter right.  Drives me crazy!  How can they be teaching one sound and then for the review they say a different sound for the same letter?  And, while I am being so critical in this review, I might as well add that for the letter E they end it by showing an eagle wearing a graduation cap.  They say, ""Un Educated Eagle"".  Let's really show that we *are* educated, shall we, and say ""*An* Educated Eagle"" not ""un"" (unless they are really saying ""Uneducated Eagle""....which would fit with the uneducated way they present this video).

As you can tell I have serious issues with this video and could never recommend it to anyone.  It really deserves no stars from me but Amazon requires I give at least one.  Even though this did have some improvements over BFI (noting the upper and lower case, two sounds for the vowels and letters C and G, better graphics, etc) I'll keep my BFI Letters and get rid of this one (it belongs in the trash!).  Please don't buy it.  At least see if your library has it first.  Please read my other reviews.  I promise they aren't this long!",1114560000,139,7588,4.3070362473347545
1691267,5,B000063S6M,"My daughter is now 15 months old and knows most of her alphabet! I started showing her the video when she was 10 months. I was worried that she's just viewing it passively, but by 12 months she's able to say the letters ""H, I , O"". For some of the letters she could even say the sounds!!! She could point to letters and say them whether they're on a cereal box or on your sweatshirt.

She surprised me one time by saying the sound of ""L"", which is pretty hard to do since they have to learn to roll their tongue.

I supplement her learning by reading to her and pointing out letters whereever they are. She thinks it's a game and have fun saying her letters. She also liked playing with her Leapfrog ABC's Magnet and also the Leapfrog Phonics bus.",1109030400,3,747,4.216783216783217
1691268,5,B000063S6M,"I bought this DVD when my son was about 4 months old, along with the Brainy Baby 123 but didn't show him the videos until he was about 6 months old - which was after I had already made my own home-made alphabet and numbers 1-20 flashcards (the idea was to get him familiarized before showing the ABC and 123 videos).  Indeed, both videos complemented my son's learning of the alphabet and numbers 1-20 because at 11 months he started to identify the entire alphabet and the numbers 1-20 in his books. I pasted my home-made flashcards on a board and at 13 months old as he watches this ABC video, he cross references the letters that he sees on the video against my home-made alphabet board.  At 14 months old, he points and recognizes the letters in his books, letter and number prints on my shirt, public signs, billboards, and just about everywhere he can see letters and numbers - when we go shopping, at the register, and even at the Doctor's clinic. He even says the sound of the letter when he recognizes it. It's just amazing how these brainy baby ABC and 123 videos complement my son's learning. I strongly recommend these videos that are truly educational.  These are great tools to prepare a child and be ready to learn reading.  By the way, I have all the baby einstein, leapfrog, bumblebee, your baby can read, Richard Scarry's, and the Do the Alphabet Sesame street videos, and I must say each of these have their own style of teaching babies. And my son loves each and everyone of these videos so much.  One tip: be interactive  and have fun with your child as you introduce each video. The key is you yourself must enjoy the video first and pass the enthusiasm to your child. (note: REMEMBER TO REFRAIN FROM ANY HINT OF PRESSURING YOUR CHILD)  You'll be amazed at how rapidly your child can learn!
