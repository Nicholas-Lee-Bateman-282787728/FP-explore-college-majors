3009879,5,B000XXWE2G,"I must admit I wasn't expecting much when I decided to watch Soul's Midnight, but as a lover of any kind of horror I must admit I was pleasantly surprised. Soul's Midnight is not a big budget vampire thriller, and you can tell if they had a little more money they probably could've done much more, but for what it was, I enjoyed watching Mr. Assante take apart a couple of victims with his fangs.",1203120000,,396,4.293333333333333
3009880,1,B000XXWE2G,"Again, they make a film with a decent story a good actor (the others I will get to) and finally Vampires, which, I love. and yet they manage to ruin this film So Badly I couldn't even recommend it to my B movie fanatics. truly another tragedy. Armande Assante could have shined in this role but alas due to a terrible budget and a very bad actress (Lucila Sol as Armande's Vampire girl) Has got to be quite simply put, the worst actress I have ever had the extream displeasure to have been tortured with. the story starts off with a young couple going to a very strange hotel where a Satanic cult of Vampires awaits unsuspecting people but wait, the main character is related to St. George and is supposed to slay the ""dragon"" in this case vampires. ooof. this like i said Had the chance to shine but was so tarnished by bad acting, low budget and a story that could have been good (**spoiler**) the demon at the end looked decent however the suit looks very much like the one worn in the 1972 Film Gargoyles. and that by far was a better film.

do not buy this. I will put the product link like I always do, but remember, I told you this film is BAD! and I have watched every vampire film made.
one star because I cannot give it the big fat Goose Egg It Deserves.

If you Must, You Can Buy It Here.

3009881,4,B000XXWE2G,"OK, I can't give this movie 5 stars because it's not the Godfather.  But it is good.  Very good.  Armand Assante (a la 2007's awesome American Gangster) puts in a great performance.  And the writers, who clearly knew the subject matter, created a horror movie for people who know and love the genre.

8230136,2,B000XXWE2G,Very disappointed.  Looked  at the preview on You Tube;I was given the impression that this movie was a vampire picture.  It was more like a cult movie.,1426118400,,152,4.555555555555555
8230137,4,B000XXWE2G,A fun movie!  A perfect fit for a collection of better than you expected horror genre films!  The movie was filmed in Oklahoma and includes several scenes in historic Wesley UMC in Oklahoma City and sections in Guthrie.  Grab some popcorn and get set to enjoy a matinee horror classic.,1423699200,,285,4.66
8230138,5,B000XXWE2G,"Good acting, much better than your average vampire film. Worth a look. 5 stars!",1420156800,,79,4.714285714285714
8230139,1,B000XXWE2G,Armand Assante must have been DESPERATE for money or something when he agreed to star in this film. He's the only actor who can actually act. Everyone else in the film just kind of stands there and reads lines. It is soooo bad. Don't wase your money! I can't believe some people actually LIKE this movie! Terrible peice of you-know-what!,1344643200,,337,4.633333333333334
8230140,1,B000XXWE2G,Huge waste of Armand Assante. He's one of America's best actors but this film was well below his talents. One absolutely brilliant moment late in the film but this is one truly terrible movie.,1305504000,,192,4.676470588235294
8230141,4,B000XXWE2G,A good horror movie involving the sacrifice of a descendant of St George to resurrect the dragon leader of a cult headed by Armand Assante. good special effects,1259539200,2,160,4.75
8230142,5,B000XXWE2G,"This movie rocks! the script was well written, and plus it had Armand Assante .",1237939200,,79,4.333333333333333
8230143,5,B000XXWE2G,"I found that the film turned out Great, and NOT Because I was an Extra, but it REALLY turned out Great. Armand was the Best to work with as was the Director Harry Basil, Producer Gray Frederickson, of the GODFATHER films was also the Best as well. Lots of action, blood and guts, effects and so forth. I also suggest the Film "" Surveillance "" also with Armand Assante who plays a deranged Mall Cop Directed by Fritz Kiersch, Director of "" Children of the Corn "".",1214697600,,462,4.32183908045977
8230144,2,B000XXWE2G,Mediocre vampire movie.  Actors were good; music was good; storyline was mediocre.  The main reason I bought it was that I was raised in the house in which it was filmed.,1207353600,3,170,4.451612903225806
8230145,3,B000XXWE2G,"Armand Assante is a vampire. His lover is. His father is a long-dead demon (or 'dragon'). He wants to resurect his dead dad. In walks a descendant of St. George with his pregnant wife.

The vampires want to use the baby as a sacrifice in order that Armand and his demon dad can be reunited.

So it's about demons, vampires, blood sacrifice, possession, etc. All rolled into one very low budget and (almost) sexy film.",1203984000,3,417,4.546666666666667
