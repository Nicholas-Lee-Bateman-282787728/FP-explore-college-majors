8081494,3,B000B5MC5U,"RELEASED IN 1988 and directed by Renny Harlin, A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master details the resurrection of Freddy (Robert Englund) and his goal to wipe out the remaining Elm Street kids from the previous movie (Rodney Eastman & Ken Sagoes) before turning his attention to a new batch, which includes a surprisingly formidable young woman (Lisa Wilcox).

The director, Harlin, was basically a no-name before this movie, but after its surprise success at the box office, the most profitable Nightmare flick up to this point, he went on to direct major Hollywood flicks, like Die Hard 2 (1990), Cliffhanger (1993), the doomed Cutthroat Island (1995) and Deep Blue Sea (1999). In an interview he laughed when asked about Nightmare 4, explaining  that he was basically hired to do a rush job due to the previous ones unexpected success (1988s A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors). The producers gave him a deadline, a small budget and a five-page outline for a screenplay. They obviously weren't concerned with the quality of the movie; they just wanted to put out another Nightmare as-soon-as-possible as a cash-grab. Harlin took the job; pretty much writing the dialogue as they moved along.

Winsome Tuesday Knight is a highlight, but her presence is never really capitalized on even though she has a beach scene (and Im not talking about nudity or porn). Still, her role is respectably beefy. Lisa Wilcox emerges as the protagonist and has a good story arc, but they coulda done more with her as well. Speaking of the women, pin-up girl and B-flick actress Hope Marie Carlton has a cameo.

There are some creative parts, like the cockroach and soul-pizza sequences. The movie perhaps works best as a period-piece of 1987 (when it was shot) and is surprisingly good in light of the challenge Harlin faced. Nevertheless, for me, its the least of the first four movies.

THE MOVIE RUNS 93 minutes and was shot in the Burbank/Los Angeles area, California.
