Some of the humor in it is pretty dumb and while the matches are good, I'm just not into wrestling enough for me to not be truly honest on this review. The boyfriend absolutely loved it though, and it brought back a lot of the nostalgia from his childhood and with the wrestlers her grew up with. Now that being said, I do wish it had focused more ON the matches than the commentary but beggars and choosing and all that jazz =3",1393804800,,515,4.108910891089109
7891563,5,6305550875,oh god. this is what life's all about. everyone should own this tape. women should be rated according to if they like it or not. it should be shown on primetime every night of the week. best sh&t ever to be put to tape. i love it. the wrestling is incredible and the commentary is so damn funny i just about pissed myself. buy this buy this buy this. i can't ephasize it enough. my favorite parts: the mushroom boy brawl and deadly fred getting powerbombed into the thumbtacks. brutal as all hell. i'm not a big icp fan. at all. but this is genius.,1076544000,3,548,4.228571428571429
7891564,5,6305550875,"...unless you want to rip your stitches out from laughing.  This is hysterical!  Raunchy, tasteless and vulgar; nonetheless, freakin' hysterical.  Whether they thought up a script beforehand or not, ICP gives what sounds to be an ad libbed commentary for some of the wildest hardcore matches.  The names they give to the wrestlers as well as the holds and moves come off as something just conjured up.  The shock value of their comments adds to the unbelievable match footage on the video.  Even the ""$25 Battle Royal"" break from hardcore is entertaining just because of ICP.  Watching these matches would be a pretty cool hardcore wrestling video.  ICP possesses a great deal of knowledge of professional wrestling, so the avid fan gets the humor; yet, the sheer force of their profanity for profanity's sake makes this a guaranteed laugh in a cancer ward.  Don't watch this with your preacher; a preist, maybe, but definitely not a preacher. There is no funnier satiristic commentary for anything.  StrangleMania sets the standard for hardcore wrestling/comedy/fun!",1064275200,3,1067,5.151162790697675
7891565,5,6305550875,"Ladies and gentlemen you MUST see this.  Tangling turnbuckle, barbed wire, broken glass, thumbtack, kick to the boot face matches all commentated by ICP.  The best entertainment for your dollar.  Cactus Sac goes 1 on 1 with  124 year old ""drunk Terry Flunk!",949968000,5,257,4.906976744186046
7891566,5,6305550875,Don't listen to these other posers.  This is a great video.  ICP is their same funny self while you get to watch some of the most violent wrestling ever.  This video is worth buying just to hear ICP's commentary and it's  worth it just to buy and watch the wrestling. So don't listen to these  other people that aren't rue ICP fans. Take it from me. Get the video,944870400,10,363,4.202898550724638
7891567,4,6305550875,"If you enjoy wrestling, and you enjoy two white guys from Detroit in face-paint, then buy this video. ICP takes six matches and adds their own personal touch, seriously ill commentary. Every single type of  hardcore/death match that any fan could want. Don't miss the big  winner-take-all battle royal with a purse of 25 bucks! Who will win?  Malicious Mike? Big Larry? The Skinny Wolf?  You'll have to watch to find  out!",937612800,2,422,4.805555555555555
