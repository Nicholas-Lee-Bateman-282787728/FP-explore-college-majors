8717843,5,B00YAZNBCA,"Save for the actual official film Amy ( which is just superb) this set gives the finest outside view of the late singer, Some marvellous interviews with the girl herself are included ( albeit from archive sources, not made exclusively) which I've not seen before, and great performance footage too
This one is worth picking up",1458864000,,326,4.839285714285714

8717846,1,B00YAZNBCA,Couldn't get past the first 10 minutes. Boring. Another documentary out now (Amy) is worth watching.,1453334400,,100,5.3125

8717851,2,B00YAZNBCA,"The reason I am only giving this ""new"" Amy Winehouse DVD ""Set"" only 2 stars is because it's a repackage of ""The Girl Done Good"" DVD from 2008 and a CD ""Amy Winehouse: Exposed"" (an interview disc). The way the product was described it was going to cover Amy's life from beginning to end. Wrong! The DVD ends in 2008. It's the only ""tribute"" DVD I have bought that actually has Amy's singing in it. I think it is kinda misleading that the maker's of this ""set"" to make you think you're getting 2 DVD's of interviews, etc. I love Amy & try to get anything ""new"" or different on her, but this set is not that great. You can buy these items separately more cheaper. The only thing ""new"" was the packaging and all that is a cheap cardboard case the contains the DVD & CD in their original packaging. Folks, basically all they did was print the cardboard box and stuff their old product inside. A waste!",1440633600,20,896,4.3076923076923075
