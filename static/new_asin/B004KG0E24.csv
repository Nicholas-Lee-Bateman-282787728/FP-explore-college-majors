8432934,5,B004KG0E24,"Okay folks here's my review short and simple:

1) Picture quality is great; remastered from the originals.

2) DVD 1 has about 1 minute of German (and un-remastered film) at the start of episode 1 regardless of whether you've set it to play in English or not that must remain.

2b) By the way that German at the beginning simply relates that Cochise doesn't want any whites on his hunting grounds and that the death of Mangas Coloradas has ticked him off...and so it begins..Buck and Big John also thank a family for their hospitality.

3) I've ordered Season Two because frankly I'm now hooked.

4) Do have a DVD player and TV that can play Region 2 DVDs! (My Windows Media Player here in Germany does play them, you may want to look into that)

5) Only four stars because DVDs 5 and 6 had tech problems which require me to return the set for a new one. However these problems disappeared when viewing the two episodes which were effected on my computer instead of on my DVD player(s).

6) No way a true High Chaparral fan will be disappointed.

7) Packaging leaves much to be desired, very strange system which ""holds"" the DVDs in place, but then again SO WHAT?

8) There is about a minute or so of film adverts at the beginning of each DVD in German.

9) Episodes titles are written in both German and English seen when navigating the DVD.

10) DVD navigating instructions are in German, translated as follows from page 1:

""ALLE ABSPIELEN"" = Play All

""EPISODENAUSWAHL"" = Episode Selection

""EPISODENBERSICHT: = Episode Overview

""SPRACHEN/TON"" = Language/Tone

""EPISODE FORTFAHREN"" = Start Episode

From page 1 select ""SPRACHEN/TON"" = Language/Tone

Then select ""ENGLISCH MONO DOLBY DIGITAL"" i.e. ""English""

Next, right below that, choose ""EPISODE FORTFAHREN"" = Start Episode

You are now off to the High Chaparral!

11) You can order High Chaparral ""Staffel 1"" and ""Staffel 2"" = ""Season 1"" and ""Season 2"" direct from Amazon Germany (Link at Bottom of Page use Your Regular Password etc.) alot cheaper, [...], than what is now being asked in the USA. THEY ARE IN STOCK:

12) More good reviews in English at Amazon United Kingdom (link at bottom of page)

Adios amigos!!

Changed my mind, got to give 'er 5 stars..hehe!",1296950400,4,2230,4.700258397932816
