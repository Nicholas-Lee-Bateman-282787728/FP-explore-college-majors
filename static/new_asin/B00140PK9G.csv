8253763,2,B00140PK9G,"Player 5150 is close to the top of my ""Eject Immediately"" heap of flicks.

It's a wonder to me how a movie like this gets past a pitch meeting! Maybe an explanation is the lowering cost of actually making a movie - something excruciatingly evident in the low-budget look and feel here. A patchwork of cliche-rich dialog and awkward borrowing from other films, this DVD is barely watchable. NoPushover recommends not gambling on this one.",1340064000,,437,4.826666666666667
8253764,4,B00140PK9G,coulda been better like anything else these days  but still good movie had a good storyline and thats important  like anything else these days,1328140800,,142,4.875
8253765,3,B00140PK9G,All the usual gambling stereotypes: the shylock who crushes your fingers for not paying; the chronic gambler whose world is about to come crashing down; the politician in debt to the loan sharks etc etc. Ho hum. Unknown cast and predictable script make this just so-so entertainment for an off-night's watching.,1260230400,,311,5.117647058823529
8253766,3,B00140PK9G,"No, the film isn't based on Shakespeare.  More like Scorcese.  Unknown (at least to me) actors doing a creditable job with a mediocre, predictable script, with all the usual gimmicks, but still produced a film which moved right along and will yield a glimpse of a world unlike ours...at least I HOPE so.  Money finds its way down and up the pecking order with blood stained, bruised, and greedy fingers.  Low life stereotypes of all kinds vie for thug of the night.
Gambler/broker/daytrader lead was effective about 50% of the time and goofy the other 50%.  Pretty woman ""Ali"" and main bad guy/cook make the most of their roles with only a touch of tongue in cheek.

8253767,4,B00140PK9G,"Alright, normally I do not produce reviews of reviews of movies. However Daniel J. Sorrell ""Sherlock1c"", you have compelled me to do so. First you impugn the incorrect  ""grammer"" used by one of the reviewers of Player 5150. News Flash: It's spelled grammar. My browser has spell check. Does yours?

Secondly, you admit that you never saw Player 5150. So, what in the world are you reviewing it for???

Please crawl back under the rock from whence you came.

p.s. it's a decent movie. It's not a classic by any means but if you're looking for some inexpensive entertainment to pass the time on a weekend night, Player 5150 is a good bet -- no pun intended.",1243296000,,655,4.572649572649572
8253768,1,B00140PK9G,"I haven't seen this movie yet; i just rented it from Blockbuster. I would, however, like to review the prior review; R.Bagula. Just what is that review supposed to mean? If incoherence were an art, you'd win a prize. Aside from bad grammer and nonsensical sentence structure, it degenerates into just a listing of random phrases. I'm not sure, are you talking about the movie or your dimwit friends?",1219017600,,399,4.797101449275362
