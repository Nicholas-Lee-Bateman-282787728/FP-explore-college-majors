While the History channel's DVD is good, it just doesn't go far enough for Civil War Submarine nutcakes like me.

It would be EXTREMELY wonderful if National Geo & the owners of The Hunley movie would move it along and put them on DVD.

It would also be wonderful if interested people would go to ""Friends of The Hunley"" and make a (ahem)a donation.  There is still a lot of work to do on the preservation of it and also the Mariners' Museum for The Monitor.
