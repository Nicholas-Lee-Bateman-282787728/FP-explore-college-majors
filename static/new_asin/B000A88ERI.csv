2379563,5,B000A88ERI,"As listed, this movie is about Amelie, a young women who spend her first 5 years in Japan in the country and has longed to return to the country.  Things are never what you expect or how you viewed them as a child.  She is hired by a Japanese company as an interpretor for a year contract.  She does everything but her job.  She is not only given cultural lessons, but also lessons of human behavior.  Is is emotional - hot and cold.  I enjoyed the film and thought that it flowed well.  Even though it was subtitled, you really felt the emotional and nuances of the characters.",1128038400,3,578,4.296296296296297
2379564,4,B000A88ERI,"Having spent her early childhood in Japan, a young European woman returns to her idealized homeland with a 1 year contract in a Japanese corporation.  Full of hope, she encounters a seemingly endless series of cultural missteps and dashed expectations.  She soon discovers that she is truly a stranger in a strange land.

How bad can it get?  Very, very bad.  You'll see.

This is the Evil Twin of those movies that mine humor and happy endings out of ""fish out of water"" situation.

The film is both emotionally wrenching at times but restrained in acting and every other way.  By no means a light or uplifting story, it is neverless interesting and often very emotionally compelling.",1126915200,10,685,4.794871794871795
2379565,5,B000A88ERI,"Alan Corneau's film adaptation of Amelie Nothomb's autographical novel ""Fear and Trembling"" borders on a near perfect portrayal of a young Belgian ing&eacute;nue's desire to be understood and accepted amidst a backdrop of cultural differences as glimpsed from under the bell jar of the Japanese corporation. Corneau does author Nothomb's story one better, casting redheaded elf Sylvie Testud in the lead role.  While her wistful facial expressions easily maneuver the audience to see matters from the Western perspective from the get-go, Testud manages to achieve a Chaplin-esque timing that charms as well as amuses as she ponders her bad karma in the corporate world with an almost Zen-like complacency.

Hired as an interpreter, Amelie struggles to maintain some degree of necessity in an environment that is clearly working overtime to make her feel worthless.  As her tale of self-awareness progresses, she finds herself demoted to bathroom attendant, completely humiliated by the likes of her superior, the tall, beautiful and statuesque Fubuki Mori (played wonderfully by actress/model Kaori Tsuji) who Amelie openly admires with a fierce allegiance that pathetically fringes on fanatic adoration.

Similar in theme to Sophia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation,""  ""Fear and Trembling"" does a much better job of entertaining while delivering the Western head-scratching message regarding the Japanese philosophical fixation on obedience and loyalty to the hierarchical social entity as opposed to individual enterprise.  As the film moves towards its eventual conclusion, it never once becomes muddled or caught in the quagmire of its own cleverness.  Instead, Corneau pits Tsuji and Testud against each other with an unspoken sexual tension that beguiles with masochistic undertones.  That the two characters are attracted to each other in some perverse way adds to the utter emptiness of their lives at the Yumimoto conglomerate where the glass ceiling hangs overhead like a phantom sword of Damocles.

Bottom line?  As Amelie quakes with appropriate ""fear and trembling""---the title of this film refers to behavior expected from anyone in the presence of the emperor---she still swells within with her Western pride yet basks in her ability to be as humble as a native born Japanese.  This journey of self-discovery and cultural differences sparkles with a superior comedy thanks to Testud's Cesar winning performance and Corneau's slightly mindgame erotic adapation of Nothomb's novel.  Recommended highly.

2379566,5,B000A88ERI,"Though a comparison is made to Lost in Translation, Fear and Trembling is way more enjoyable as it focuses on Japanese cultural attitudes.  Fear and Trembling gives us an insight as to what it must be like to live Japanese, while Lost in Translation was a relationship story between 2 westerners that could have been filmed anywhere and it happened to be in Japan.

Many westerners and asians alike find Japanese culture difficult to comprehend - this movie manages to portray how a foreigner, starting off a peon, can easily descend into lunacy while trying to understand Japanese culture and in attempting to fit in.  At the heart of all the bizarre and inexplicable situations the main character Amelie experiences, is the art of giving and saving face and her inability to understand this piles on humiliation after humiliation.

The character Amelie highlights the paradox that is Japan - so admired by outsiders but I doubt that outsiders can endure a life that is the real Japan.  Highly recommended.  And yes, it is funny but oh in such a painful, incredulous way.",1174608000,5,1072,4.862637362637362
2379567,5,B000A88ERI,"This DVD, ""Fear and Trembling,"" was a nice surprise. I stumbled upon the title somehow, found it at amazon.com, and ordered a copy. Like ""Lost in Translation,"" this French film explores the cultural intricacies of a gaijin (foreigner) trying to fit into the highly structured Japanese corporation. It's a hilarious film, especially for anyone who knows anything about Japanese culture. I'm a sansei (3rd generation Japanese) in Hawaii, so I know a little about Japanese culture in US, Hawaii and Japan. The film hit home many times. I highly recommend this film for anyone interested in modern Japanese lifestyle, particularly from the perspective of a cultural outsider. This film goes well with novels by Sujata Massey, a writer with a fine eye for details about Japanese people.",1167782400,3,781,5.15748031496063
2379568,4,B000A88ERI,"My girl friend introduced me to this movie quite accidently.  Normally i go for the more historical or military flick.  But there is actually a lot of history here although most viewers probably don't realize it.

This film can be seen on several different levels.  The dreadful office life that our poor Belgium heroline endures can be seen as a universal element of work today.  It can also be viewed as an indication of present day Japanese society.  We often forget that Japan was never forced to own up to its many attrocities that were committed during WW2.  For this reason Japan is still universally hated throughout Asia today.  Unlike Germany which had its nose rubbed constantly in the dirt for its many war crimes, Japan never had to endure this purification process.  American occupation was lenient and easy going for the most part.  Japan was built back up to be a key part in the Cold War puzzle that was developing in the Far East after the war.  This resulted in a curious mix of attitudes that persists to this day in Japan.  The absolute respect for authority which goes back to the Middle Ages toward the emperor was translated into the militarists that ran the country during the war, and continues today with the businessmen and industrialists in Japan.  The work place attitudes toward our Belgium protaganist reflect this cruel and savage outlook.  This is a nation that never acknowlegded the many war crimes that it committed over 60 years ago.  To this day Japanese children are hardly educated about the frightful history of their country during the 1935 - 1945 period.  The result is a nation in complete denial of its past.  This is not surprising considering Japan was forced to modernize so quickly in order to catch up with the West.  The cruel and humilating attidues seen here in the work place are a reflection of Japanese society today.  A society that never had to own up to its many war crimes, and which still feels superior toward others.

The fear and trembling one must show toward the boss today is a direct connection with Japan's past.  Whether its the absolute authority expressed toward the Samurai War Lord, the Emperor or the head of Mitsubishi corporation (The same company who manufactured the famous zero fighter plane in WW2)the result is the same.  We should be weary of Japan's place in the world today, and constantly remind her of the follies of her past.  This film is a frightening example of what many aspects of Japan's society is today.  Is there much difference between the Japan of December 7th 1941 and today?  That is a question which this movie makes us ask.",1146614400,14,2627,4.720879120879121
2379569,5,B000A88ERI,"I thought the various characters in the film were well cast, and skillfully directed.  I really was hopeful that Amelie would be able to survive her initiation and ""challenges"".  Amelie met her challenges with courage and a sense of humor. However, she was not willing to surrender herself to the new culture she was immersed in.  At the end of the story, I felt that some of her superiors were sadened at loosing her as a canditate for their organization.  Some mentoring might have been helpful, but I do not know whether Amelie would really have been truly happy working in the company.

I really do not fault either Amelie or the work culture she found herself in.  She was skillful with the Japnnese language, but not prepared to ""let herself go"" in their culture at work.  Amelie was a very creative individual, and beautiful at many levels.

As a Westerner who worked for many years in mid-size American corporations (as an engineer).  In my later working years I had limited options as far a company culture, if I wanted to work as an engineer.  I felt unprepared for the cultural change going from a smaller organization to a larger corporation.  I did not have a mentor, and felt very alone.  I got raises, but I felt isolated after having a background where I could interact freely (as part of my job) with other departments.  There was a protocol that was unfamiliar to me.  There I was a Westerner in a Western Corporation.

Office politics can be difficult to negotiate in many cultures.

I plan to seek out the book form of this movie, as well as the writer's other book.  I am also favorably impressed with the actors and the director.

Excuse me for riding on the ""coat tails"" of the other reviewers in my relying on their reviews to provide a synopsis of the story.",1145750400,3,1783,4.570977917981073
2379570,5,B000A88ERI,"Whether you are in Japan, Belgium, Malaysia or anywhere in this world, any worker can relate to this film. Whether you are the meek worker or the supervisor, the world of the corporate ladder is satarized in this flim.

Every worker has met the loud boss, the kind coworker, the office bitch... kudos to the producers.

Hey Hollywood, please remake this film. It should be great to the American context to this film.",1143763200,,416,4.684931506849315
2379571,4,B000A88ERI,"If you are looking for funny jokes of cultural differences, you may be 50% satisfied. If you want to understand Japanese culture from a westerner point of view, you will be 75% satisfied. (More on this later.) If you are looking for an ""art film"", this one may fail you. That is why I gave it 4-stars rating.

  From a layman viewer point of view, one may find this film funny but a bit pretentious. From a art-film buff point of view, one may find this too naive. I have to say this film is not very successful to appeal to either world.

  However, if you really have the time and mind-set to understand Japanese culture (not just those mentioned in a tourist guide book), this is pretty good point to start. The film used an exaggerated manner to examplified the deeper cultural structure of Japan. The film starts with the central character (a Japan born Belgian girl) introducing her position in a big Japanese company through a company chart-way: A is B's supervisor and B is C's supervisor and finally X is her supervior. And the film ends (not the actual ending but end of her career in that company) with she telling each of these supervisors, from her immediate supervisor to the managing director, her leaving and thier different reaction to it. If you use this structure as a guide to view this film. You may find this film worth more than what it looks like initially.

  Good viewing and enjoy it. I recommend it to those who have the time and sensitivity toward other culture.",1133654400,9,1491,4.5335820895522385
2379572,3,B000A88ERI,"This film attempts to illustrate the cultural differences that exist between Japan, in a work context, and the west.  It is at best clumsy and on occassions borders on rascist. It certainly makes no effort to explain the social characteristics it illustrates.  It is not really a comedy.  It is of interest to somebody who has a knowledge and interest in things Japanese and can see what the director is attempting to do, but I cannot see what appeal it would have to anyone else.",1130976000,3,480,4.623529411764705
2379573,5,B000A88ERI,"I haven't seen the movie just yet but the book is just excelent, I don't know if the english translation is good or not but the original french version was so deliciously good to read..but I do wonder if the director was able to recreate those wonderful scenes in the book, like when Amelie(who is also the author..it's a semi auto biographic book) imagines throwing herself through the building window, that particular part in the book was amazing because of her description but can it be as beautiful on film?",1130371200,,511,4.688888888888889
2379574,2,B000A88ERI,"This was supposed to be a comedy, but instead it is two hours that alternate between boredom and absurdity.

The hero of the story is a well-trained, educated and skilled translator who -- instead of acting like an adult -- allows herself to become the whipping girl of a group of sadistic bosses.

If any company like this actually exists in Japan, or anywhere else, I pity the poor workers. But I cannot waste my sympathy on anyone who chooses to stay and put up with the abuse and humiliation like this protagonist does.

And frankly, the acting consisted primarily of Sylvie Testud looking either bewildered or blank. Even the ""fantasy"" interludes didn't add interest.

A cross cultural workplace may a goldmine of comedic ideas, but this movie didn't manage to emerge with even a single nugget worth watching.",1129248000,4,814,4.83453237410072
8076240,5,B000A88ERI,"My Francophile American friend who is very, very well read told me this is one of his favorite movies ever.  He asked me to evaluate Sophie Tessuds Japanese speaking ability.  I read, write, and speak Japanese, so though I was put off by the photo of the white face and red lipstick of a geisha on the DVD cover, I gave it a try.

I was blown away by how accurately this movie captures how Japanese people  and people in any competitive urban office setting anywhere in the world  really are.  We all know about how many Westerners go on and on yadda yadda about the politeness, the demureness, the respectfulness, the reserve and the elegance of Japanese people.

The absolute truth is that they are a mean, vicious, racist, sexist people.  They are just like the Brits particularly the Londoners, the New Yorkers, the Shanghainese, the Parisians, the Romans, you name it.  If you have lived and worked for a length of time in any these places, you know just how petty, uncurious, and insular the elite people can be towards outsiders.

This movie captures in particularly wincing detail the meanness and competitiveness of women towards other women.  Who is married, who gave up heterosexist norms to climb the corporate ladder, who is a loser, who is a winner in a supposed meritocracy.  To be grown up is about hiding ones true feelings at all costs, putting others down both subtly and openly, and hen pecking constantly.  Of course, the ugliness of feminine competition is not limited to Japanese women.

Here, we are privy to the truth of Japanese female competitiveness because the Japanese-speaking main character lets us actually hear, understand, and suffer at every mincing denigrating word that is said to her.  Without the main characters sensitive and accurate comprehension of, and emotional response to the hostile and critical words, all we would see are the visually pretty Japanese faces, just as most tourists would see.

The movie also accurately portrays Japanese corporate elites cultural and racial superiority complex and ruthlessness.  The winners here make it clear that they have no need to hear what a pretty young white European girl has to say. They don't want to know her or be known by her.  Corporate Japan is a continuation of feudalistic society. Not only is she a superfluous outsider, eventually, her superiors place her at the lowest feudal rank, as the untouchable, of the toilet cleaner caste.

Back to the original question of Sophie Tessuds Japanese speaking ability: Her Japanese is grammatically super-precise, idiomatically correct, and rich and sophisticated in vocabulary.  The perfection of the grammar and diction is in striking contrast to the rather heavy French accent.

If I were to meet a person in real life who speaks like this, I would assume she is a literature or history scholar who mastered the language as an adult.  This is to say Tessud does not sound at all like someone who lived in Japan until age 5.  People who grew up there in the early years and then left tend to have a good speaking accent, but lack the vocabulary or practice to speak substantively on any serious subject.  For example, they will not have mastery of honorifics or gender-specific grammar.  A foreigner who speaks gender, age and rank-neutral Japanese gives him or herself away as an outsider.  They can say pleasantries but cannot understand basic goings-on in television news or read newspaper headlines.

As for comparisons between this movie and Lost in Translation, another movie about white people in Japan: this movie is thousands of times more intellectually curious, critical, and nuanced.  This movie is about how Japanese people really are, and how a young European woman who for her own personal reasons wants to be part of that society is rejected.  The characters in Lost in Translation are a total contrast.  They are not invested in Japan for the long term, and are only interested in themselves, and are rather shallow and unprobing about the Japanese.  They are not even trying to learn a few Japanese phrases.  Coppolas story could have been located in any country and at best it is an accurate depiction of how privileged white Americans act overseas.

Though I had never heard of Amelie Nothomb, the author, this movie made me want to read the book.  She must be of a rare mind.  I rarely feel this way about movie adaptations.",1393027200,3,4390,4.8785425101214575
8076241,5,B000A88ERI,"I suppose if you were to cross ""Swimming with Sharks"" and ""Lost in Translation,"" you might get something close to the tone of this film.  However, the performance of the main character definitely raises the quality of the movie into the realm of the believable.  It is, in fact, based on a true story.  Still, it's a rare thing to see a movie that is at once funny, frightening and absurd.  I highly recommend ""Fear and Trembling"" to anyone who has been in a work situation that is less than ideal.",1378166400,2,498,4.43956043956044
8076242,5,B000A88ERI,"Based on the memoirs of Amelie Nothomb, a Belgian woman who spent her childhood growing up in Japan, this film is the tale of her return to that nation as an adult who finds that being born in Japan and speaking the language perfectly does not make one Japanese.  Amelie lands a one-year contract as a Japanese/French interpreter for a major Tokyo conglomerate, and the film tells the story of that year.  As she commits social errors, violates taboos, and is given busywork  - from delivering coffee to cleaning the bathrooms - actress Sylvie Testud captures just the right tone as Amelie, moving from the comic to the tragic.  A delightful film.",1374624000,,647,4.75
8076243,5,B000A88ERI,"The advertising on the disc state it is akin to ""Lost in Translation"", I found that this comparison to only be minor when viewing this film.

This movie is about so much more than cultural differences.  It is about the universal issues we all face.  Amelie was born in Japan and lived there until age 5, when her parents return to their homeland of Belgium.

As a young, recently graduated adult, she seeks to return to the land that seemed so serene she so admired in her early formative years.  Unfortunately, things change and this movie incorporates multiple themes: 1) learning how the adult world operates; 2) being the lowest person on the food chain; 3) having to learn corporate culture and Japanese culture with little guidance (one man does try to help her but her reputation has already been sullied beyond repair); 4) her refusal to acknowledge her desperate situation because of her own naivete; 5) her courageous stand not to allow her circumstances define her.

I found the acting superb.  The characters are sharply drawn without distraction or great embellishment.  The creativity to take such a great struggle and find comedic relief throughout makes this a 5 star movie!

So, if you have ever:

1) been challenged by a new job in a new field of work;
2) had a boss that hates you and seeks to embarrass and humiliate you at any cost;
3) had coworkers that lacked empathy and shared your bosses' willingness to humiliate
  you by joining in bullying;
4) had to find the courage to stand against such humiliations to demonstrating that you
  will not be broken;
then, you will become Amelie as she faces her adversaries!

Well done to the author for having insight into the good and bad of humanity and expressing it so adeptly, the film writer for portraying this story with such finesse, and the actors for their outstanding performances.",1351382400,3,1858,4.7625
8076244,5,B000A88ERI,"This film is both funny and it teaches you a lot about the Japanese way of life and the huge difference between it and a Western culture. Recommended for people who want to learn about Japan, but it's also a very entertaining film.",1257897600,,231,4.395348837209302
8076245,5,B000A88ERI,"I came to this movie with no real knowledge of the working environment in Japan. It was quickly apparent to me, however, that the characters were drawn as  delightful hyperboles that only enhanced the genius of this superb little movie. I guess some people need stark realism in every movie they see. As for me, I like a well-crafted story that is well acted and that takes me somewhere I've never been before, and FEAR AND TREMBLING certainly fits that bill.

The movie was so beautifully developed that I was afraid it was going to let me down in the end. It didn't. I would not have changed a single moment and found myself fully satisfied, which rarely happens in movie watching. I saw it online at a movie rental site and gave it 5 stars there too, another thing I rarely do.

One hundred seven minutes of pure enjoyment.",1254528000,4,826,4.493333333333333
8076246,3,B000A88ERI,"I made a genuine effort to understand the creation of the working environment stereotypes in Japan through this film, but I must say that I only identified extreme exaggerations and serious omissions.
I am European who lived and worked in Japan for 16 years and during those years I made an effort to understand the cultural differences and working ethics between a European company and a Japanese one.
I do not believe that a girl, perfect in the Japanese language, brought up in Japan, was not aware on how to integrate in a Japanese working team; after all it is not as difficult, although challenging, as it was portrait in this film.
Where were her usual ""Office Ladies"" team with their support and the little gossip, where were those after-working hours drinks with the fellow workers and so many other elements?
The after-working hours drink is a way to integrate and become a member of the team.
In the company I was working we had foreigners who were able to integrate well because they have been part of the team.
I also found the stereotypes of the Department manager and his superior as extremes in their roles and behavior.
I also found the contrast between bulling a young employee and thinking to promote her within 6 months of practically no performance as a paradox.
If the film was supposed to be funny, it failed to a great degree.
If the film was supposed to present the working environment in a Japanese company, it is short of expectations
If the film was to be a new ""Lost in Translation"" it failed again because Lost in Translation was a foreigner's relationship that incidentally was taking place in Japan and the Japanese stereotypes were complementary to their experience in a funny and pleasant way.",1240012800,9,1727,4.740863787375416
8076247,5,B000A88ERI,"If you want a taste of what corporate culture in Japan is like, and some insight into the old saw 'east is east and west is west and never the twain shall meet', this is a great film to watch and talk about with your gaijin' friends who have lived and worked in Nihon. But, a warning, some Japanese friends did not like it at all, and a few were offended by it.",1233792000,2,361,3.958904109589041
8076248,5,B000A88ERI,"Usually when I read a book and then see a movie, I end up disappointed.  Not in this case.  The film is an amazing rendition of the novel that remains true.  The movie runs a little under two hours and the editing from the original story are fine.

It is a story of a young Belgium woman (Amelie) who yearns to go back to the spiritual peace that she experienced as a small child growing up in Japan. She learns how to speak and write impeccable Japanese.  She wants to become Japanese, in manner of speaking.  Amelie manages to score a one year contract with a top Japanse corporation and thinks she is well on her way to obtaining her objective of becoming one with the the Japanese culture.  Being western, this is impossible of course, and her naive foray into blending is considered an insult not a compliment by her employers.

Despite all of her knowledge and attempts to become one with her environment, it is not allowed by the Japense corporation (or society).  We see some sections that applaud her efforts and realize that the old ways of doing things need to be changed and do their best to help her (or any western influence) but they are doomed to fail.  These two cultures are diametrically opposed and will never mesh, the film seems to say.

At the end Amelie has come to realize that she is by nature, a westerner despite her desire to be ""Japanese.""  The best she can do is serve out her one year contract to save face, a Japanese principle.

More importantly, I thought it was about self-actualization and learning to achieve peace from within instead of looking for external sources.",1218067200,2,1605,4.53125
8076249,4,B000A88ERI,"Many years ago, I used to work in Asia (China).  It was fascinating to be part of the world totally foreign to me until that moment.  For that reason, I wanted to see this movie and experience how it is (or was) for others in similar situation.  Here is the story of a young Belgian woman, college graduate, fluent in Japanese and nostalgic about childhood past and romanticized experiences from living in Japan.  She is about to recapture the time lost in between and reclaim her belonging in Japanese society.  The eagerness to please does her no good but rather puts her in more trouble every time to the point that she is demoted to a bathroom attendant.  One must show the utmost respect for the actress Sylvie Testud who managed to learn Japanese language for this role. The story of young woman's will and determination in keeping the demeaning job for the entire duration of her contract in spite of humiliations she experiences is both funny and heartbreaking.  Human nature, cultural differences and misplaced loyalties all overlap in this powerful story.  Definitely see this work -- it will not leave your feeling indifferent.",1188604800,4,1138,4.829896907216495
