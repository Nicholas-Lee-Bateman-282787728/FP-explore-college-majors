And its also not a Oscar winner or any other price for acting or whatever, but just a nice movie to look at on Christmas. No thinking, just watch the movie and have a nive time.",1184457600,,261,3.7636363636363637
2643846,5,B000HWZ4KW,This movie you have to watch before the second movie of this type. (Twice Upon a Christmas) Kathy really does a great job at being Santa's daughter. Alone with the other actors/actress in the movie they all did great. We really need more movies of this type. There is NO swearing in this movie or the second one.,1168473600,2,312,4.396551724137931
2643847,4,B000HWZ4KW,"In spite of all the cheese, I could not stop watching it when it first aired.  The story is very well written and sincere.  It's an enjoyable family holiday flick to add to your collection!",1166054400,2,189,4.371428571428571
2643848,5,B000HWZ4KW,a great night for the family to spend together. Not too many films today can be viewed by the entire family. This one is. It reminds of the movies we watched as children with our parents. you will love it.,1165708800,2,205,4.15
2643849,3,B000HWZ4KW,"ONCE UPON A CHRISTMAS is a made for tv movie filled with schmaltz, goo and Christmas sentiment; however, it's message is good and it's an enjoyzble movie to sip some egg nog with.

Kathy Ireland is gorgeous; can she act?  Well, in the Christmas spirit, let's just say if anyone can get away with syrupy dialogue, Ireland's the one.  The rest of the cast is mediocre with the exception of the delightful Liz Torres who is wonderful as the Tooth Fairy.

The plot revolves around Santa's disillusion with Christmas, so his youngest daughter Kristin (Ireland) convinces her pop to let Christmas go on if she can change one family's whose name has been crossed off the nice list.  Matters are complicated by her witchy older sister Rudolfa, who wants Christmas to go in a new direction--Christmas Fools Day with whooopie cushions, etc.

The movie did well enough that it spawned a sequel TWICE UPON A CHRISTMAS, which I haven't seen yet, but I don't have a burning desire since this one is just okay.  Merry Christmas.",1164758400,3,1013,4.721590909090909
