8220732,5,B00007LOY3,"Excellent teaching tool! Instruments include bongos, timbales, maracas, guiro, and cowbells. The sections on bongos and timbales were especially great. Nearly 40 examples are notated in the accompanying booklet and demonstrated in the video. The full band does several songs, and some rhythmic patterns are demonstrated at slow and fast speeds. Luis Conte plays congas. I'm an intermediate player and benefitted from going over the material about 10 times. If you're a beginner, watch it 20-30 times. Highly recommended.",1217808000,,520,5.594936708860759
