A Harlot's Progress (also known as The Harlot's Progress) is a series of six paintings (1731, now lost) and engravings (1732) by William Hogarth. The series shows the story of a young woman, Mary (or Moll) Hackabout, who arrives in London from the country and becomes a prostitute. The series was developed from the third image: having painted a prostitute in her boudoir in a garret on Drury Lane, Hogarth struck upon the idea of creating scenes from her earlier and later life. The title and rich allegory are reminiscent of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.

In the first scene, an old woman praises her beauty and suggests a profitable occupation, procuring her for the gentleman shown to the back of the image. She is a mistress with two lovers in the second, has become a common prostitute on the point of being arrested in the third, and is beating hemp in Bridewell Prison in the fourth. By the fifth, she is dying from venereal disease, and she is dead aged only 23 in the last.

The protagonist is named after the heroine of Moll Flanders and Kate Hackabout. Kate was a notorious prostitute and the sister of highwayman Francis Hackabout: he was hanged on 17 April 1730; she was convicted of keeping a disorderly house in August the same year, having been arrested by Westminster magistrate Sir John Gonson.

The series of paintings proved to be very popular, and Hogarth used his experience as an apprentice to a silversmith to create engravings of the images, selling a ""limited edition"" of 1,240 sets of six prints to subscribers for a guinea. Pirate copies of the engravings were soon in circulation, and Hogarth procured a 1735 Act of Parliament (8 Geo. II. cap. 13) to prohibit the practice. Soon after, Hogarth published his second series of satirical and moralistic images, A Rake's Progress, followed some years later by Marriage -la-mode.

The original paintings were destroyed in a fire at Fonthill Abbey, the country house of William Beckford in Wiltshire, in 1755. The original plates survived, and were sold by Hogarth's widow, Jane, to John Boydell in 1789; by him to Baldwin, Cradock and Joy in 1818, and then to Henry Bohn in 1835. Each produced further copies.(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

3144989,5,B0015I2SLA,"I was hooked from the first scene, thanks to Toby Jones' stellar performance.  And how I cried later on. I just love period/costume dramas, but we are usually treated to seeing the fabulous wealth of the times. Equally as outrageous is the sheer poverty, squalor and hopelessness that also existed. And humankind's utter contempt for lost souls. The starving children, the sick prostitutes. And here and there someone emerges who does care. I'd never heard about William Hogarth, but so glad I know about him and his paintings now. This film is strong story-telling and every character you meet is compelling. And it does go to show that you don't need many elaborate sets or sweeping landscapes when the subject matter and acting is so well done. I did not encounter the same audio problems the one-star reviews had to put up with. I did hear plenty of background noise, from children crying, men and women doing their thing in other rooms, etc...it didn't overpower the dialogue for me, and I felt it was completely appropriate considering the places where they lived. Like hearing the city streets from an apartment nowadays. I love films that kick you in the gut and make you wonder about humanity...and make you thankful that we live in times that grant people, women in particular, much more opportunity and hope.",1510272000,4,1319,4.862222222222222

The interpretation of Hogarth's infatuation with and compassion toward Mary is fascinating. The whole thing just drew me in. So much to think about.

I didn't realize that the film was originally a made-for-British-TV film. I watched it on my laptop and didn't notice any of the audio problems that others pointed out. I'm sure those sound discrepancies would be amplified if I'd watched on my TV. As I often do, I used subtitles and didn't notice the background noise of crying children expect in the brothel scenes.",1509667200,,653,4.9363636363636365
3144992,5,B0015I2SLA,"William Hogarth pulled no punches in his use of political art to critique the dark side of London's social fabric. Artists, good and bad, have used their capabilities to comment on reality and it's shortcomings since Egyptians scribbled graffiti onto stone and the humor, threats and revealed secrets haven't ceased since. This movie shows Hogarth as a witness to misery and poverty and the struggle to deal with them and the tolls they exact.

3144996,3,B0015I2SLA,"Despite serious sound problems this is overall a fascinating tale of a real mid 18th century artist, William Hogarth,  who is inspired by his muse, a young prostitute, who had potential but lived in a time and place where an orphaned young woman had few options despite being attractive, well spoken, and genteel. Arriving in London alone, a madam quickly grooms her, and she begins a downward predictable spiral documented by Hogarth, whose prints of his drawings of her make both the harlot and the artist live well beyond their lifetimes. Both the film and Hogarth's prints are like a time capsule from a time and place where people, especially women, generally lived and died without much opportunity for achievement. It is a relatively dark tale, not suited for kids or teens, and not a good choice when you are looking to feel uplifted.",1507334400,3,842,4.847222222222222

3144999,5,B0015I2SLA,"A splendid film done with tremendous respect for Hogarth's work as a painter and print maker who was compelled to depict the cruelty, hypocrisy, misery and despair that prevailed in London during the 1700's.  The Harlot's Progress is so well done that it brings the viewer squarely into the conditions of that time.  It is not without humor and beauty and this helps to tell of the tragedy of people who were cursed by poverty and merciless moral codes but aspired to better times nonetheless.  Toby Jones is one of our most skilled actors and I always wish for more awards to come his way.  If you like his acting, see The Painted Veil and Infamous.",1506124800,3,650,4.577586206896552

From the first man on down to the men of this generation men still refuse their rightful place within the Kingdom and reject God.  Instead of obeying God, they have rejected Him and made their flesh their own god.  Throughout the generations men have taught women and children, instead, to lust after the flesh - that lust is ""love"". Men worship their flesh and manipulate women to follow suit.  The fall of man was the rejection of God and the acceptance of Evil.

3145015,3,B0015I2SLA,"As with other reviewers, I thought the subject matter interesting as we see the reality of London's ""mean streets"". The rather Felliniesque film quality in many scenes, and the look at Hogarth the artist and his wife, Jane Thornhill (her father was a famous court painter and Hogarth's first art teacher) was also well done. Clearly, H would have been at home with the Expressionists, and the Moderns. His scenes of married life, The Rake's Progress, and this real series The Harlot's Progress were revolutionary, and predicted the political revolutions to come.

I used the English subtitles as one can barely hear a thing over the music and voices. Many this was to convey the noisiness of the time? Thin walls? I think, however, it's a sound mixing problem that apparently the filmmakers couldn't give a rat's bum about.",1504396800,12,823,4.920863309352518

Firstly, you do not have to be familiar with Hogarth, his work or any of the other characters that inhabit this drama to enjoy the film. (a sigh of relief for the American audience!) Just take it as the moral tale of a country girl, with big ideas, coming to the big city to ""cash in"" on all the easy marks.  The reality is quite different.

The premise that Hogarth meets this girl on her first day in country, develops a fascination for her and uses her as a muse is common enough.  The actors are all excellent, the settings and costuming are what you expect form British costume drama and the pacing draws you in quite rapidly.

I will not divulge the plot twists and turns, but, as can be expected in a moral tale, there is a moral tale to be seen.

A Harlot's Progress (also known as The Harlot's Progress) is a series of six paintings (1731, now lost) and engravings (1732) by William Hogarth. The series shows the story of a young woman, Mary (or Moll) Hackabout, who arrives in London from the country and becomes a prostitute. The series was developed from the third image: having painted a prostitute in her boudoir in a garret on Drury Lane, Hogarth struck upon the idea of creating scenes from her earlier and later life. The title and rich allegory are reminiscent of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress.

In the first scene, an old woman praises her beauty and suggests a profitable occupation, procuring her for the gentleman shown to the back of the image. She is a mistress with two lovers in the second, has become a common prostitute on the point of being arrested in the third, and is beating hemp in Bridewell Prison in the fourth. By the fifth, she is dying from venereal disease, and she is dead aged only 23 in the last.

The protagonist is named after the heroine of Moll Flanders and Kate Hackabout. Kate was a notorious prostitute and the sister of highwayman Francis Hackabout: he was hanged on 17 April 1730; she was convicted of keeping a disorderly house in August the same year, having been arrested by Westminster magistrate Sir John Gonson.

The series of paintings proved to be very popular, and Hogarth used his experience as an apprentice to a silversmith to create engravings of the images, selling a ""limited edition"" of 1,240 sets of six prints to subscribers for a guinea. Pirate copies of the engravings were soon in circulation, and Hogarth procured a 1735 Act of Parliament (8 Geo. II. cap. 13) to prohibit the practice. Soon after, Hogarth published his second series of satirical and moralistic images, A Rake's Progress, followed some years later by Marriage -la-mode.

The original paintings were destroyed in a fire at Fonthill Abbey, the country house of William Beckford in Wiltshire, in 1755. The original plates survived, and were sold by Hogarth's widow, Jane, to John Boydell in 1789; by him to Baldwin, Cradock and Joy in 1818, and then to Henry Bohn in 1835. Each produced further copies.(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

3379486,5,B0015I2SLA,"I was hooked from the first scene, thanks to Toby Jones' stellar performance.  And how I cried later on. I just love period/costume dramas, but we are usually treated to seeing the fabulous wealth of the times. Equally as outrageous is the sheer poverty, squalor and hopelessness that also existed. And humankind's utter contempt for lost souls. The starving children, the sick prostitutes. And here and there someone emerges who does care. I'd never heard about William Hogarth, but so glad I know about him and his paintings now. This film is strong story-telling and every character you meet is compelling. And it does go to show that you don't need many elaborate sets or sweeping landscapes when the subject matter and acting is so well done. I did not encounter the same audio problems the one-star reviews had to put up with. I did hear plenty of background noise, from children crying, men and women doing their thing in other rooms, etc...it didn't overpower the dialogue for me, and I felt it was completely appropriate considering the places where they lived. Like hearing the city streets from an apartment nowadays. I love films that kick you in the gut and make you wonder about humanity...and make you thankful that we live in times that grant people, women in particular, much more opportunity and hope.",1510272000,4,1319,4.862222222222222

I knew that forced labor was part of being jailed or imprisoned, but the hemp connection was something else! Had wikipedia open during the movie to help with who was who. Also liked the occasional factoids printed on screen to circle back to real events and people.",1510272000,,376,4.8
3379488,5,B0015I2SLA,"Really interesting storyline and creative filming. Acting by Toby Jones and Zoe Tapper and every other actor in this film is excellent! The interpretation of Hogarth's infatuation with and compassion toward Mary is fascinating. The whole thing just drew me in. So much to think about.

I didn't realize that the film was originally a made-for-British-TV film. I watched it on my laptop and didn't notice any of the audio problems that others pointed out. I'm sure those sound discrepancies would be amplified if I'd watched on my TV. As I often do, I used subtitles and didn't notice the background noise of crying children expect in the brothel scenes.",1509667200,,653,4.9363636363636365
3379489,5,B0015I2SLA,"William Hogarth pulled no punches in his use of political art to critique the dark side of London's social fabric. Artists, good and bad, have used their capabilities to comment on reality and it's shortcomings since Egyptians scribbled graffiti onto stone and the humor, threats and revealed secrets haven't ceased since. This movie shows Hogarth as a witness to misery and poverty and the struggle to deal with them and the tolls they exact. The movie, beautifully filmed and acted, does an excellent job depicting the sights and sounds of a city and it's inhabitants who have been wounded by a capitalist created caste system.",1509580800,,629,5.0
3379490,5,B0015I2SLA,This film was excellent.  The  actor's and actresses were magnificent. you were taken back to this era  in time. Amazing how nothing has changed in that women  continue to be used and abused by men,1509062400,,197,4.542857142857143

3379493,3,B0015I2SLA,"Despite serious sound problems this is overall a fascinating tale of a real mid 18th century artist, William Hogarth,  who is inspired by his muse, a young prostitute, who had potential but lived in a time and place where an orphaned young woman had few options despite being attractive, well spoken, and genteel. Arriving in London alone, a madam quickly grooms her, and she begins a downward predictable spiral documented by Hogarth, whose prints of his drawings of her make both the harlot and the artist live well beyond their lifetimes. Both the film and Hogarth's prints are like a time capsule from a time and place where people, especially women, generally lived and died without much opportunity for achievement. It is a relatively dark tale, not suited for kids or teens, and not a good choice when you are looking to feel uplifted.",1507334400,3,842,4.847222222222222
3379494,5,B0015I2SLA,"""A Harlot's Progress"" was beautiful, entertaining, and enthralling. A deep story, apparently based slightly in history. Absolutely worth watching!.",1506988800,,147,6.7894736842105265
3379495,1,B0015I2SLA,"It's regrettable that the producers evidently squandered so much of their budget on costumes & d&eacute;cor that they could not afford to hire competent talent in the sound & photograpy departments.
The result is a slapdash m&eacute;lange of jumpy, murky video with inaudible dialog.
Amazon's annoyingly common practice of pasting sloppy subtitles on the package was the final defect that rendered it, for me, unendurable.",1506902400,3,422,5.507692307692308
3379496,5,B0015I2SLA,"A splendid film done with tremendous respect for Hogarth's work as a painter and print maker who was compelled to depict the cruelty, hypocrisy, misery and despair that prevailed in London during the 1700's.  The Harlot's Progress is so well done that it brings the viewer squarely into the conditions of that time.  It is not without humor and beauty and this helps to tell of the tragedy of people who were cursed by poverty and merciless moral codes but aspired to better times nonetheless.  Toby Jones is one of our most skilled actors and I always wish for more awards to come his way.  If you like his acting, see The Painted Veil and Infamous.",1506124800,3,650,4.577586206896552
3379497,1,B0015I2SLA,"Did you know that Adam was standing next to Eve as Satan was tempting her?  Adam didn't protect her, he did nothing, he said nothing.  God gave men the place as ""head and high priest"", meaning that men are responsible to meet with God in prayer and supplication, putting the Kingdom first, every day so that the things of heaven will be passed on from God to the male to the female and children for each generation to know and live by.  From the first man on down to the men of this generation men still refuse their rightful place within the Kingdom and reject God.  Instead of obeying God, they have rejected Him and made their flesh their own god.  Throughout the generations men have taught women and children, instead, to lust after the flesh - that lust is ""love"". Men worship their flesh and manipulate women to follow suit.  The fall of man was the rejection of God and the acceptance of Evil.  Therefore, we have this filthy movie that is historically accurate in depicting godless men and women..",1505606400,,1006,4.524861878453039

3379512,3,B0015I2SLA,"As with other reviewers, I thought the subject matter interesting as we see the reality of London's ""mean streets"". The rather Felliniesque film quality in many scenes, and the look at Hogarth the artist and his wife, Jane Thornhill (her father was a famous court painter and Hogarth's first art teacher) was also well done. Clearly, H would have been at home with the Expressionists, and the Moderns. His scenes of married life, The Rake's Progress, and this real series The Harlot's Progress were revolutionary, and predicted the political revolutions to come.

I used the English subtitles as one can barely hear a thing over the music and voices. Many this was to convey the noisiness of the time? Thin walls? I think, however, it's a sound mixing problem that apparently the filmmakers couldn't give a rat's bum about.",1504396800,12,823,4.920863309352518

As an art history minor, I knew a little bit about William Hogarth (Satirical artist, painter and engraver, Died October 1764 (aged 66)), but I have a new appreciation for what he did. If you love art history and Charles Dickens type truth about the class society of England (he proceeded him nearly 100 years later), you'll adore this movie, as I did.

A statement of the price women have paid over the years for men to have their forbidden pleasures.  A story about a woman who aimed high but had the misfortune to fall in love with a penniless, married dreamer who loved her as well, but was powerless to stop the misery the world threw at her.  An exposition about the reality, indeed the probability, of a horrible death for those who lived in poverty in this time before social welfare programs were a reality.

This is the story of how an unknown prostitute became the inspiration for one of England's most famous painters.  I was familiar with Horgarth's prints, but the story behind his original paintings is both informative and entertaining. It's a short film with terrific, believable acting.  The captioned/running commentary provides key facts about 18th century London and famous figures such as Henry Fielding. Recommended for fans of the movie Mr. Turner or the tv series Harlots.

I had recently watched the ""Vice City"" series from BBC and I am not sure how these two are linked together (if at all) but as they both deal with the seamy London of old...

Firstly, you do not have to be familiar with Hogarth, his work or any of the other characters that inhabit this drama to enjoy the film. (a sigh of relief for the American audience!) Just take it as the moral tale of a country girl, with big ideas, coming to the big city to ""cash in"" on all the easy marks.  The reality is quite different.

The premise that Hogarth meets this girl on her first day in country, develops a fascination for her and uses her as a muse is common enough.  The actors are all excellent, the settings and costuming are what you expect form British costume drama and the pacing draws you in quite rapidly.

I will not divulge the plot twists and turns, but, as can be expected in a moral tale, there is a moral tale to be seen.

A big NO for the kids until they are of an age to understand words like prostitution, human trafficking, grinding poverty and moral bankruptcy.",1370131200,3,1307,4.323770491803279
