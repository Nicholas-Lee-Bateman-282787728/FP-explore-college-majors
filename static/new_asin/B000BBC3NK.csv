8084462,5,B000BBC3NK,"The Gunn brothers strike again, and this time they knock their target off the wall. This revelatory and no-holds-barred DVD takes a look at the literally shaky town of San Francisco, complete with its hatred of Christians and rampant sexual promiscuity.

The main sexual sin this piece focuses on (and the one San Francisco probably promotes the most) is homosexuality. Rather than being one prolonged sermon against it, the film largely focuses on the bigger issue of homosexual marriage and the attacks against Christians who protest it and Christianity as a whole. The frightening truth is that San Francisco is not a tolerant city: it's a city that attempts to force-feed homosexuality to children and has threatened the lives of Christian kids in order to terrify their parents. The Gunn brothers interview Christians who have witnessed to homosexuals, stayed in the city inspite of threats to their lives, and held pro-Christian marriage rallies. The alarming parts of the DVD include footage of a church being accosted by mobs, men walking around naked from the waist down in public, and a woman cheerfully explaining that she and her co-workers are selling porn in front of City Hall. While I personally believe that homosexuality is an unchosen condition and that such people should never be harassed (and often can't change their sexuality), I'm afraid that the Gunn brothers were right in their summation of this city's motives: the forced celebration of homosexuality in this city is about sex, not love, tolerance, or acceptance. This is proven by the increase of porn-selling, the disgusting graffiti dishonoring Christians, and the gay men happily showing their genitals to the world, all of which occured after the city decided to be so heavily ""accepting"" of gayness.

Lest you think this film is unbalanced in fairness, the Gunn brothers interview several people with opposing opinions, including homosexuals themselves. One particularly pretty woman in a wedding dress spoke more than once about her own wedding to her female partner and what her thoughts were on the whole situation. Nothing was said to disparage her words or even contradict them; the Gunn brothers simply allowed her to give her side of the story and, as with most of the interviews, let the situations and opinions speak for themselves.

I found this DVD to be a far more open and accurately researched piece than the Gunn brothers' other film, and I offer all my personal praise to the filmmakers for their efforts and success in this piece. While the film is brutally honest about the dissoluteness of the city, the filmmakers show tastefulness by blurring profanity in the graffiti and the exposed bodies of the naked men, so this film could easily be used in a Youth Group or similar gathering as an educational tool. I highly recommend it!",1514764800,18,2834,5.038379530916845
8084463,3,B000BBC3NK,"As a senior citizen with bad hearing, I found that it did not have closed captioning to give me a good presentation.  The film lacked the visuals I expected, and is outdated by recent events in the liberal agenda.  However, the subject needs to be addressed much, much more thoroughly from the Biblical perspective.  I would not wish eternity in Hell on anyone.  The other reviews have already expressed my feelings from a Christian perspective.",1438732800,3,445,4.8933333333333335

8084465,4,B000BBC3NK,"I believe that this is an important, if deeply flawed documentary about homosexual activism in San Francisco.

On the plus side:
* it's technically competent in its cinematography.
* it spotlights politically active, traditional Christians in San Francisco, a group of people so marginalized and ignored that they could accurately be described as a subculture in that city.
* in contrast to the zeitgeist, it casts a critical eye on homosexuality and homosexual political influence.
* it contains powerful footage of a church being besieged and assaulted by gay activists, a scene that cannot help but recall the attack on the house of Lot by the men of Sodom.

On the negative side:
* the narrator has an almost indecipherable Scottish accent.
* the film's thesis is confused and its focus diffuse: instead of giving emphasis to one idea, they flit from subject to subject (gay marriage, physical intimidation of Christians who oppose the gay agenda, the illegality and political corruption brought about by the influence of the gay community, the spread of public immorality in the streets, i.e. porn sales and nudity) without producing a single sharply defined message, besides the fact that ""gays are bad.""
* there is a disproportionate focus on the members of the numerically insignificant Orthodox Presbyterian church, which is the faith of at least one of the Gunn brothers. What about the Catholics, the evangelicals, the Pentecostals? They have no real voice here.
* the film-makers are hobbled by their own decorousness. Because they are Christians and this film is targeted towards Christians and church groups, the film lacks sensationalism. A blurred shot of two lesbians kissing and a blurred shot of the backs of two naked men walking down the street are about as provocative as the film gets. Because of such restraint, this film will only confirm Christians in their pre-existing negative feelings about gays. If the film-makers really wanted to influence the vast, mushy middle, all they would have needed to do was film one afternoon at the Folsom Street Fair.
* the last criticism isn't the fault of the film-makers, but events have made this film outdated in the very few years since it was made in 2006. At that time, the California Supreme Court had declared gay marriage illegal, and until 2012 even Barack Obama opposed gay marriage. Things have now taken a drastically different and unexpected turn that renders this film a bit passe'.

Still, it's a unique film in all respects, that merits watching.",1366761600,2,2527,5.05515587529976
8084466,5,B000BBC3NK,"San Francisco is a city in which some people love their sin so much that they will do anything to force others to embrace it. A Gay Pride Parade is glorification of a sin which is condemned in both the Old and New Testaments of the Bible. In the Four Gospels, Jesus, the Son of God, who is responsible for inspiring all Holy Scripture, was an Orthodox Jew. Therefore, He believed every word of the Hebrew Scriptures and lived according to the Old Law Covenant. He never changed his Father's Law about homosexuality. It continued to be a grievous sin during His life on earth. After the Gospels, there are twenty three more books inspired by God. In those books it is clearly stated multiple times that Homosexuality is still a sin. We all are born with different and inherited sinful natures, but we don't have to behave sinfully. We have self-control, and we have a forgiving Savior. Watch the DVD, and give it to someone.",1365206400,4,923,4.566265060240964
