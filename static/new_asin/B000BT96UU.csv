8092401,5,B000BT96UU,"It's a good movie, for saluting Bruce Lee. While the fighting scenes are a bit routine, looks good but too many predictable moves. Also, after David got the tape, it's understandable that he tried to listen to it before give it to the police. But, as least he should've inform the police to rescue the miss or do something instead of forgetting the miss until the phone call came. His behavior in movie doesn't make logical sense. There are also many other logical flaws in order to make the ending went to where they want it to. So I have to say the movie has pretty bad story line.

2 stars if not for Bruce Lee.",1483747200,,614,4.293103448275862

8092404,5,B000BT96UU,"As a Bruce Lee fan, I've seen not only all ofnhis movies but those of the many Bruce imitators. Bruce Li is hands down the best. But beyond the Bruceploitation, Bruce Li had the charisma and acting ability to hold his own which is why he became such a star in his own right. Exit The Dragon is jam packed with everything that made Bruce Li great.

The only thing that kind of made the movie a little less enjoyable for some reason was that they filmed a few external shot of Betty Ting Pei's actual apartment at the time where Bruce died. That was kind of a buzzkill, but obviously it was the director or producer who decided to film there, not Bruce Li's fault.",1346976000,4,662,4.253968253968254
8092405,1,B000BT96UU,The quaility is so bad that a vhs tape would be better. Maybe they will remaster it someday. I wouldnt waste money on it till then.,1333843200,,131,4.076923076923077
8092406,4,B000BT96UU,"I actually own both versions of this movie. This film was originally released as ""Bruce Lee Star of Stars"" in Cantonese(which can be found on the Return of the Dragon Pack with 3 other such Bruceploitation flicks), but for the purpose of marketing and promoting Ho Chuong Tao(Bruce Li) in the U.S., it was re-cut, dubbed over and released as ""Exit the Dragon, Enter the Tiger."" Predictably, in either case...the film begins with Tiger(Bruce Li) meeting up with Bruce Lee(Bruce Li) and Betty Ting Pei during a movie shoot about 3 days before his passing. On the set he's having multiple headaches, tells Tiger about mysterious phone calls, and deems Tiger as his successor in the event of his death. In either version, Bruce's death leads to Tiger's own investigation into what turns out to be Bruce's murder and his findings lead him into a mafia-like conspiracy that ends with Tiger battling the Baron, who lures him into a duel of the death by kidnapping Betty Ting Pei and his(Tiger's) girlfriend and holding them hostage.

Honestly, the only thing that cheese up the film as that they're exploiting the mysterious circumstances surrounding Bruce Lee's death and incorporate the use of actual, real-life personalities into the plot, meaning we see the fictionalized torturing of Betty Ting Pei my syndicate thugs, meetings between Tiger and Betty Ting Pei, pictures in her apartment with love notes from Bruce Lee, a mysterious recording of a supposed phone conversation about Bruce's murder,etc. However, the action is there, and I was particularly impressed with the quality of product. This one's a keeper not just because of the action, but because it's a 2006 re-issue and the best, remastered Bruce Li flick since Anchor Bay re-released Goodbye Bruce Lee:His Last Game of Death(Bruce Li). Only thing is that you can't fast fwd and there are no chapter selections, but overall, good movie, good quality, just falls short of a 5 in my book for being Bruceploitation as opposed to an authentic Ho Chuong Tao production.",1170892800,4,2025,4.991124260355029
