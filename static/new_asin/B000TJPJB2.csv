8209831,5,B000TJPJB2,"This movie, although perhaps not well known or reminded in America these days, is one of the best. You will likely book a few weeks and dedicate yourself watching it, episode by episode. You will be captivated every single minute. Don't forget to start with Book 1, you will certainly have a crash on it. An absolute must-have for Classics lovers, don't miss it!",1279584000,,362,4.671875
8209832,4,B000TJPJB2,in comparison to book I frankly book II should be considered a joke but that is still not a knock because book I was a classic and very hard to match. But independently book II is a great story. It is an eye openning experience about the corruption in government that existed back then and still can at present. Magnificent performance by Strauss and Haskell. It has very little connection to book I with the exception of Falconneti which makes it enjoyable even to people who missed book I.,1239148800,,491,4.52808988764045
8209833,3,B000TJPJB2,"When this mini series first aired on TV, it held my family and I spell bound. We could not wait till the next week. I even tried to record it but failed. So when I saw it for sale many many years later on AMAZON for $120, I dug down deep and purchased it. I will only say that over the years it has lost some of its magic only because of greater TV mini-series and movies were more modern. Still a good story, but seems slower paced.",1227744000,,433,3.9318181818181817
8209834,5,B000TJPJB2,"The sequel to ""Rich Man, Poor Man,"" Book Two begins where the finale ended, with Tom's murder and follows Rudy Jordache as he continues his Senate career and attempts to pull together his career, family life, all while trying to honor the memory of his brother. Peter Strauss is superb in the lead role - barely 30, he is playing a man ten to fifteen years older, believably, beautifully - and he is the rock that holds the series together.  Susan Sullivan, Gregg Henry, Penny Peyser, and others, offer strong, sterling support.  The sequel may be more melodramatic than its predecessor, but it is also more timely: Washington corruption, war profiteering, the disintegration of the family, the increasing obsession with celebrity, the corrupting powers of fame - all of these are important subplots that are deftly portrayed in this terrific series. Without a doubt, it was the forerunner of lesser soaps like ""Dallas,"" ""Dynasty,"" ""Falcon Crest,"" and the like, but none had the resonance and depth of this series: often, superb, Emmy-award winning editing and camera work elevates the series to cinematic greatness, other times it is more pedestrian. Yet notice how many women directors and writers worked on the series - surely rare for its time.  And the first rate support of great, classic actors like Van Johnson and Barry Sullivan only adds to the overall quality.  Arlo Guthrie even makes an appearance!  ""Rich Man, Poor Man, Book Two,"" takes you back to the '70's and the Nixon era, and yet its themes remain more timely than ever and the human values depicted and portrayed: the true meaning of love, faith, friendship, power, career, are all beautifully realized in sharp writing and terrific, passionate acting. This series is HUGELY popular in the UK and should be here. BOTH ""Rich Man, Poor Man,"" and this terrific sequel should be given first class DVD treatment - and surely re-introduced to American television audiences in some fashion. This is so far above the quality of ANYTHING on TV right now that it's beyond obvious. There are no gimmicks here - no camera tricks, no winking or ironic acting, of the kind that you get in most TV series today.  This is just plain, pure, strong story-telling. Strauss, apparently, was offered millions to continue on for a ""Book Three,"" but possibly did not want to typecast himself too young playing an older Senator. Too bad, as this series got better week by week and had so much to say about America that it could have been taken in many more interesting and illuminating directions. But Strauss's work in this series - with first class support from everyone involved - marks this a landmark series that time has treated kindly: it's STILL the story of America and STILL depicts all of the problems we are currently dealing with. You will feel, watching this series, with a villian in Falconetti, more layered, complex and horrifying than the villian in ""No Country For Old Men,"" that you are viewing an unjustly neglected masterwork. A superb, five star, TV series, unlike any other!",1205712000,14,3045,4.891472868217054
8209835,5,B000TJPJB2,"I watched this in its first run on Tuesday nights at 9pm.  It is unfair for those who feel it wouldn't be as good as its predecessor.  Rich Man, Poor Man - Book II held its own & was actually better than Book I, in my opinion.  The characters & storylines were engrossing & you felt for the characters & couldn't wait to see what would happen next.

James Carroll Jordan, Gregg Henry, Peter Strauss, William Smith, Damitra Arliss, Susan Sullivan, Kimberly Beck, Penny Peyser, Cassie Yates, Laraine Stephens & Peter Haskell shone in the continuing saga of the Jordache family, & Rudy's ongoing mission to bring the evil Falconetti to justice for the murder of his brother.  The final episodes on location in Vegas are suspenseful & riveting as everything comes to a head in the conclusion of the series.

I can't understand why the miniseries has been released to DVD in the UK first, & the fans there are great cheerleaders of the show. Yet no sign of an NTSC american release to speak of.  I know there are other fans like myself who remember this series & would like to see it get the DVD treatment on this side of the pond as well...  What is Universal waiting for?  I know they're taking forever to put out the Bionic Woman.  I just hope it won't be another several years before this is on the shelves of US retail stores.

Go to TVShowsOnDVD & cast a vote for a DVD set of this magnificent masterpiece.

8209836,4,B000TJPJB2,Rich man two continues where it left off leading in with snipits of Rich man one and is a very creditable follow up though it was never going to match the original. Tom's son Westley and Rudy's step son Billy play a large roll in the story line and the menacing Falconetti is back. Rudy's ups and downs continue as he sets out to fullfill Tom's dying wish. Some good acting performances and one I particuarly liked was that of the owner of Greenway Records (reminded me of Danny Devito)The ending resolved one main question but left a number of others unanswered,1185753600,3,562,4.519607843137255
