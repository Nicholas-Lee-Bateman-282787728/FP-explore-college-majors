8412766,2,B001BXTQR8,"While I can appreciate the effort of this gangster flick, it just falls flat. The torture scenes are not very violent or intense. Most of the movie, you don't have a clue what's going on. There is a lot of talking in this film, and not much action. Fortunately, I only paid a few dollars for the used DVD from my local Family Video.",1463097600,,332,4.203125
8412767,1,B001BXTQR8,"No use trying to tell the violent story with very phony torture by gang members.
Bad lighting, shot mostly in dark, bad sound, bad acting and unsure ending.",1270339200,,156,4.607142857142857
