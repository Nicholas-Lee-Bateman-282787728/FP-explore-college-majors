7959315,4,B000063K2I,"First Review: Silent Service is full of action, adventure, sea battles and backroom politics.  As long as you don't mind the Anti-American slant, which I don't because the anime movie doesn't show the Japanese leaders in a very nice light either, and don't mind the fact that the Seabat seems to be able to hit anything the Captain wants it to hit, the story is a very good one.  It asks many Post-Cold War questions, like what role will Japan play and how will the Americans continue to be the police force of the world when even a tiny nation may have nuclear weapons?  What kind of relationship will America and Japan have after the Cold War?  100 minutes long, this anime movie asks a lot of hard and valid questions.  Made in the late 1990's, the artwork holds up well, if sometimes very dark (as in hard to see in those underwater scenes).  The plot can get VERY twisted because of the fears and paranoia of BOTH sides.  I give it 4 out of 5.
Second Review: Area 88 is a 50 minutes movie about a fighter pilot named Shin.  He was tricked into joining a air mercenary group in which the only ways out are to either survive for three years, pay 1.5 million dollars, desertion OR death.  The problems, or maybe I should say issues, he has is that he is not sure his girlfriend will wait for him or even want the man he has become - a cold blooded killer.  While an older movie, made in the mid-1980s, and also being the FIRST of what is a two parter, as they show the trailer to Area 88 Act II on this DVD, I still have to give it 4 out of 5 for the drama, the issues of friendship and the cool combat scenes.
Both movies are good enough to buy together or alone, depending on what kind of story you like.  I would suggest also getting Area 88 Act II if it is available.",1057276800,,1773,4.185294117647059

Area 88 Vol. 1:
In the year 1979, a mercenary base of jets fights for the kingdom of Asrian. But these pilots aren't really soldiers. They were either tricked or chose to come to Area 88. The only way to get out of Area 88 is either 3 years of service, earn 1.5 million dollars in kills or dessert. Shin Kazama, a Japanese pilot, was tricked into joining by his closest friend, Kanzaki, because Kanzaki wanted Ryoko all to himself. Now, Shin tries his best to get back home.
For an 80's OAV series with only 3 episodes, I must say it is quite amazing. The animation is smooth and the music perfect. Even the air combat is great. All of the characters feel very realistic and none of them seem they're just for show. The disc itself is pretty good. The main menu, however, is real slow. Video quality is okay. There are only a few small rainbows here and there, but it shouldn't bother you. The extras are basically skip to your favorite scenes parts for both combat and characters. Overall, a pretty good title that will have a lot of replay value to it.
Silent Service:
A Japanese\American submarine is built called the Seabat, that is armed with 8 torpedo bays, making it the most powerful sub ever built. However, on it's way to the escort, the Seabat deviates from it's coarse and soon claims the sub as the nation of Yamato. How much more complex can it get?
Considering that this was the first film Ryosuke Takahashi has ever done, it is a pretty good thriller. It's not really an all explosion ship battle because the Seabat never actually fire any armed torpedoes, only duds. Still, the film holds up well as a thriller. Again, this disc has skip-to-scene extras, but also has some DVD-Roms extras as well. This title is not really an exciting action packed film, but as a thriller, it is sure to entertain.",1025481600,,1852,4.498516320474778
