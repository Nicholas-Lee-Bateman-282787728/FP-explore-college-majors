8586477,5,B00CU9QF1C,"Just a little trivia this film also goes by the name of 'Wild Women' when it airs on Cinemax. All in all I have this movie a 5 out of 5 cause you get everything you can expect from a movie with a name(both names) like this. It's your standard midnight movie acting with all gorgeous women and plenty of nudity. And the story line is pretty decent too. My only negative thing I would have to say about the DVD release is they should have kept the Cinemax name Wild Women, reason I say that is the two main women are not aliens and not from ""Another World"". They wish upon a shooting star then get taken to a space ship but I wouldn't say they are actually from Another World.  Anyway, I would definitely recommend buying this film if your a fan of and collect the late night midnight movies, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",1434240000,,822,4.235668789808917

8586482,1,B00CU9QF1C,"This movie and the ""Big Bust Theory"" are terribly done.  The girls are no up to par.  I did not expect Oscar winning acting, but jeesh, this was hard to watch.  I turned it off after 10 minutes.  This is not anything close to Fred Olen Ray's work in Ghost in a Teeny Bikini.  Again, these movies aren't out for awards, but it was like they did not even try.  I regret these purchases and would not recommend Amazon to even sell this badly done so-called cinema.  I still can't get the stink off me after watching some of this!",1385942400,2,526,4.2
