8094822,4,B000BZIT9I,"I purchased the dvd for my 5 year old son who loves classical music. The content was above his level and there was not much in the way of actual music pieces being performed, but the information and content was very interesting on an adult level. The optional part of the specific musical compositions was also interesting, but didn't perform pieces of music individually. Overall this is a good 35 minutes for someone who wants to know about the artist, but not something I would watch over and over again.",1167782400,12,507,4.644444444444445
