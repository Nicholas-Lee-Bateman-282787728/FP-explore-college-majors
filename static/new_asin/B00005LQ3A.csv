7944355,5,B00005LQ3A,"My 2 year old LOVES Dora the Explorer.  We now have a few of these tapes, since Dora is not on t.v. all day long.  This tape, the second in our collection, is adorable.  She loves the episode with the little blue bird (where does he have to go?  To the little blue tree!).  I like these videos because they do teach the children some basic Spanish words, instead of just having them glued to watch the show.  Now my daughter uses words like ""Vamanos!"" and ""delicioso"" correctly, and at 2, I think this is a pretty big accomplishment.  We recommend Dora the Explorer videos to everyone we know and give them as birthday gifts.  They are always a hit!",1024876800,3,649,4.35
7944356,5,B00005LQ3A,"We got this today and my daughter (3yrs.) couldn't watch it enough. She was soooo into this adventure, helping Dora and Boots. I was entertained too, listening and watching her. Dora is perfect for preschoolers. A MUST HAVE FOR YOUR TODDLER OR PRESCHOOLER TOO.",1003795200,5,260,4.931818181818182
7944357,5,B00005LQ3A,"Dora is loved by both my 19month old and my 3 year old.  She gives easy to repeat instructions that both children understand and love to shout back.  My 3yr old gets the most from the tapes and can follow the story, it has enough singing and animation to keep the baby happy too.  I also noticed my 3yr old counting to 15 and saying a few words in spanish that I had no idea she knew.  To say the least I was impressed.",999734400,2,419,3.9523809523809526

If you are familiar with the TV show, this is familiar territory: interactivity, a little Spanish, enough repetition to help reinforce concepts, and a celebratory dance at the successful end of each adventure. Boots the Monkey is as hyper as ever.
If you are not familiar, please note that the video has two self-contained episodes on one tape. There are opportunities for your child to participate in the action (by pantomiming a pulling action to help Dora pull her wagon out of the mud, for example) and to apply knowledge of shapes, colors, numbers, etc. You will probably be surprised by how much even very young children can and do participate. I have not found this video to be tiresome to watch repeatedly, as some products targeted for preschoolers can be. The stories follow a very strict formula (so your child will catch on to how to participate), but the actions are not so repetitive as to be boring.
If your child likes the interactivity of Blue's Clues, then Dora the Explorer: To the Rescue will be another good fit for your video library.",999734400,3,1131,4.66
