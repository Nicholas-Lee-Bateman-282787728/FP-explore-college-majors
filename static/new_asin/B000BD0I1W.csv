8085263,4,B000BD0I1W,"The Barber of Siberia directed by Nikita Mikhalkov is a good drama/comedy film taking place in Russia in the year 1885 and starring Julia Ormond as American Jane Callahan, Richard Harris as Douglas McCracken, Oleg Menshikov as Russian Cadet Andrei Tolstoi, Aleksei Petrenko as General Radlov, and Vladimir Ilyin as Captain Mokin.
The Barber of Siberia started with a very interesting beginning of how Jane and Andrei meet on the train and Andrei gets drunk off champagne and breaks her fan which would turn out to be a crucial part of the movie. But Andrei is in military school and has to get in formation and march while drunk. Along with shifts back and forth from the present of Jane writing to her son in a military school. After the spout with Andrei getting drunk he and his friends get in trouble and have to wax the floor in the school for a dance which provided some comic relief.  Then at the ball one of his friends jokes about dancing with Jane so Andrei challenges him to a duel with swords. They wake everyone up after Andrei gets stabbed in his shoulder. Once out of the hospital he goes to see Jane to give her a fan that he broke in the beginning. But he was picked to by General Radlov to help him ask to marry Jane but instead ask Jane to marry him instead. This leads them to become rivals and ends with false charge.
The film itself is acted really well. There were some moments like when Andrei got stabbed in his shoulder you could feel the actors worried and brought that worry to life. It just wasn't them trying to act it felt a bit realer. Which is pretty cool to see in a foreign film. Most don't have that great of acting like the scale lf Hollywood but this film does a great job of showing this to the fullest.
Another filmmaking aspect the film got right would be the directing of Nikita Mikhalkov. The play was very detailed story line that made sense like at the beginning Andrei broke Janes fan you would think why he put it in there then put then worked it in there a key piece of the plot. All the shots were good the camera didn't really shake. This was a well put together movie that flowed smoothly with some comic relief.
I think this was overall a good quality movie that had good amounts of drama without being overdramatic and by the adding of comic relief this becomes a more enjoyable film to watch. I think this is a film I could watch again and I think you should give this movie a shot. Who knows this movie my surprise you in more ways than one.",1489017600,,2496,4.333333333333333

8085265,5,B000BD0I1W,"This is now one of my favorite Russian language movies. The acting is great and the scenery is breathtaking. It is not exactly a happy movie, but that's Russian drama. There's lots of looks at the culture and customs. I was surprised to find Richard Harris in a Russian film, but the actors are all good.",1268006400,3,304,4.446428571428571

8085267,5,B000BD0I1W,"Definitely a great epic movie, the Barber of Siberia, brings to the screen the story of Jane, a beautiful cosmopolitan courtesan and Andrey, a young Cadet in the Imperial Army, during the reign of Tsar Alexander III in Holy Russia.
The film combines drama, action, and adventure, making it one of the best of its kind, thus, resurrecting interest in historical films after a long dormant period.
Needless to say, Oleg Menshikov, Julia Ormond, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are outstanding to say the least!
The setting, the music and the costumes are all wonderful!
History, Love, Passion, and Honor, are all about.
Nikita Mihalkov has scored his biggest hit yet with the Barber of Siberia, which is guaranteed to shed more than just a few tears.
Strongly recommended along with Admiral and 1612 for those with a soft spot for all things Russian!",1247011200,,902,4.901960784313726
8085268,5,B000BD0I1W,"From the very beginning I was totally absorbed in this spectacular film, and the time seemed to go by so quickly as one brilliant scene followed another. There were moments of breathtaking splendour - the dazzling ballrooms and the colourful Russian fair - and so many exquisite details that it is a film to be watched over and over again.
Julia Ormond and Alexey Petrenko were so convincing, and there was truly a sense of stepping into another place and time. The film also seemed to capture the unique Russian humour - I laughed aloud several times - as well the exhilatating moment when Tsar Alexander III gallops across the courtyard with his young son, Nicholas, in front of him. It really brought Imperial Russia alive again! I had the feeling, throughout, of being transported into a magical world!

8085269,2,B000BD0I1W,"This is my favorite movie of all time, and have gone through several copies of it.  So, it was to my dissapointment that upon the arrival of the DVD from the seller, I discovered that it was a pirated copy.  It i s a good copy, but has no subtitles, no menu, nothing.  You don't sell fake movies for 16 dollars.  I could have paid 21 dollars for the real version through another seller.  It's going to take a miracle for me to buy from this seller again.",1214179200,3,454,4.113636363636363
8085270,5,B000BD0I1W,This is one of the most romantic Russian Films I have ever watched. The actors are incredible. The scene is captivating. The plot is fluid and intense. This is my favorite movie. There are few films to compare it to. I highly recommend this film to anyone.,1198800000,,256,4.468085106382978
