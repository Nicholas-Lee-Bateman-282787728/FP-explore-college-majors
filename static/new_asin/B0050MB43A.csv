4515234,5,B0050MB43A,"The films and quality of this set are AWESOME.  You get 4 separate great quality DVDs, rather than multiple films copied onto one disc as so many of the ""sets"" are usually made.  Every one of the films are great classics [especially ""All Mine To Give].  You won't be disappointed.",1327968000,52,280,4.56
4515235,5,B0050MB43A,"The only thing I was sorry with on this purchase, was the fact that the four movies were placed directly on top of each other, instead of placed in separate slots. Otherwise, the quality was good, and sound not too bad, considering how old these movies are.",1326931200,20,257,4.48936170212766
4515236,4,B0050MB43A,"I have only had time to watch two of the movies, Holiday Affair, and It Happened on Fifth Avenue, but they were both very entertaining.  In Holiday Affair a very young and handsome Robert Mitchum, fresh out of the service, loses his job to protect a young, beautiful war widow from getting in trouble and losing hers.  Janet Leigh is a struggling single mom working as a secret comparison shopper who buys a very expensive Lionel train for her store, takes it home where it is seen by her small son, and returns it the next day.  Obviously the son thinks the train is for him, Mitchum keeps popping up in the mom's life, meets the son, finds out that the boy is expecting the train for Christmas, and buys it for him even though he is out of work and has little money.  The rest is a Christmas romance with obvious outcomes.  Cornell Wilde makes a nice appearance as Leigh's nice, but rather boring boyfriend.  The film is a little dated now, but still a wonderful Christmas romance and seeing a young Robert Mitchum again is a treat.

It Happened on Fifth Avenue is a screwball comedy with a charming hobo who lives the winter in closed mansions while the owners have gone south.  He meets a war veteran, Don DeFore (the neighbor on Ozzie and Harriet in the 50's) and takes him in without explaining that the house is not his.  Eventually Gale Storm, the owner's real daughter, shows up and she hides her identity, joining the little group.  Others get involved as the little party grows, and then the real owner, Charlie Ruggles, shows up.  He, too, hides his true identity at his daughter's insistence, and the fun increases.  I had never seen this movie somehow, and found it delightful.  I will watch it every Christmas from now on, and maybe a few times in between.  A real treat.  Very warm, family film.

If the other two movies are even a little bit entertaining, this will be a five start package!",1326758400,83,1907,4.5

4515342,4,B0050MB43A,"I'm giving this collection 4 stars, only because of the quality of the four films in the collection. However, as a ""Classic Holiday"" collection ... well, BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST and ALL MINE TO GIVE had a slight reference to Christmas, but as far as a pleasant, uplifting collection for the Christmas, etc. holidays? Both BLOSSOMS IN THE DUST and ALL MINE TO GIVE were real, old-fashioned ""tear jerkers"" and not exactly the kind of Christmastime favorite films that would go well with ELF, and version of A CHRISTMAS CAROL, HOW THE GRINCH STOLE CHRISTMAS, IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE, etc. The other two films: IT HAPPENED ON FIFTH AVENUE and HOLIDAY AFFAIR were more in keeping with the holiday - although both films were delightful if not to say unusual. I believe that director Frank Capra was interested in doing IT HAPPENED ON FIFTH AVENUE. That film, coming as it does from the what was once Monogram Pictures, is quite a surprise! If you want funny, uplifting films to watch during the Christmas season, go with IT HAPPENED ON FIFTH AVENUE and the off-beat HOLIDAY AFFAIR.

4515357,5,B0050MB43A,"These movies are timeless from a perspective of decent writing, great acting and moral content. There's nothing out there anymore that approaches the whole feel good package that these movies portray.
My only criticism was pertaining to The Holiday Affair. I think they should have had someone other than the very likable Wendall Corey as the boyfriend who loses the girl.  Or cast someone more likable than tough man Mitchum as the man who wins her. Cary Grant, Jimmy Stewart, Joel McCrea or especially Gary Cooper would have been better choices. I really hated the ending. But that is just my opinion.
The other three movies are fantastic holiday classics.

4515496,4,B0050MB43A,"My wife caught an airing of ""It Happened On 5th Avenue"" last year and fell in love with the movie. This Xmas season (2013), she made a point of learning when it would be broadcast and caught it again.

This Fall, I stumbled upon an airing of ""Holiday Affair"" on TCM. I had never even heard of this movie - loved it, especially the work of Gordon Gebert, who plays Timmy. It's a slice-of-life comedy with a realistic bent. Janet Leigh is stunning and Robert Mitchum makes a successful stretch playing a very sympathetic character. Wendell Corey plays the odd man out, and there's even an appearance by Henry Morgan as a police desk officer who has to decide whether or not to hold Mitchum's character in the slammer on Xmas Day (it has something to do with an orphan squirrel and a neck tie...) This is a real winner of a film - realistic without feeling the need to go overboard in any direction to make its honest effects felt.

Anyway, I decided to look for DVDs of both movies to add to our Xmas collection, so I was floored when I found both films included in this 4-DVD set, and at a very attractive price (under $10). It made a nice stocking stuffer for my wife. Each film gets its own DVD, though stacking them all on a slightly elongated single spindle wasn't the greatest option out there. The video and audio quality on the DVDs is really super, much better than I had anticipated. I only wish this set was available on Blu Ray.

I haven't viewed ""All Mine To Give"" and ""Blossoms In The Dust"" yet, as I wanted to save them for next year's holiday viewing season.

In any case, highly recommended (after all, you can't watch ""A Christmas Story"" every day!).

Why not add a couple of ""new"" Christmas classics to your collection?",1388966400,15,1736,4.429467084639499

4515512,5,B0050MB43A,"I am a movie Buff, so I have been dying to see Holiday Affair, cause I love Robert Mitchum.  It was an incredible performance by him, Janet Leigh and the little boy.  I had forgotten about this film, cause I saw it as a child, and remember how much I loved it.  It was no where to be found, except, there was a documentary called ""The merriest Films of all"" and it had the boy from this film in it, as well as Margaret O'Brien and quite a few others who are still living, and working from that era.  I hadn't seen the others at all, so I watched them as well, they were wonderful.

But I have to say, Holiday Affair will always have a special place in my heart.  It's Janet Leigh and Robert Mitchum both in their ZENITHS, beautiful, young, and amazingly touching beyond that era.  It wasn't really well received because Miss Leigh always played a victim, and Mr. Mitchum always played a tough guy.  They were both stunning and amazing in this film, and I hope it makes a come back instead of that usual holiday fare of Jimmy Stewart every year on a loop!  It's an excellent film for people who love films, and love Christmas movies from the 1950's.  Really a beautiful film.  Buy it!  It's four for the price of one!

4515536,3,B0050MB43A,"Well this is just another attempt by Warner Bros to force folks into buying movies they don't want. I purchased this collection just for Holiday Affair as the original dvd is now outrageously priced. Warner owns all the old RKO and MGM libraries so I was stuck. I love Holiday Affair, a film that should be a Christmas classic but never will. It was the first film I ever saw that starred Ribert Mitchum and I spent the next year watching almost his entire filmography because of it. Disappointed there's no trailer, it seems to have gone missing. But the quality of the audio/video on this release is very good. My biggest complaint is that the other 3 films are not holiday fare, simply films that happen to have Christmas occur in the timeline of the plot. The worst offender is All Mine To Give, the saga of a Scottish family emigrating to the western United States and all the drama that ensues when you have a gaggle of kids. Depressing, drawn out, unremarkeable. It Happened on 5th Avenue sounds Christmas-y enough but is really about greed and the problems of post-war soldiers in a prosperous America. I really enjoy Don Defore as a character actor but had he not been in this film I doubt I could have lasted 10 minutes with it. I almost fell asleep during what is supposed to be a wacky comedy. Oh but it's not. Now, Blossoms in The Dust is quite a good film. Definitely underrated as I had never heard of it. However, when a film opens with patriotic music over the creadits it's not a Christmas film. Greer Garson gives a striking performance as a woman who devotes her entire life to orphans and adoption reform. A very touching ending as well. But again, how is this a Christmas flick or one that I would watch during the holidays??? Basically Warner Bros is trying to package films together so a fan of one is forced to buy the others. A great idea is for Warner Bros to create packages of films that are lesser known, underrated gems, and market them that way. Not under the guise of holiday viewing. Five stars all the way for Holiday Affair, Four stars for Blossoms in the Dust, and 1 star for the package Warner Bros is forcing us to buy.",1357516800,2,2158,4.452020202020202

All Mine to Give I'd never heard of,and now I know why,it's a cutesy-should-be-a-lifetime-movie type movie that I'll probably never watch again. Blossoms in the Dust has absolutely no holiday reason to be in this collection. Okay, it has a Christmas ending but,really,it's a serious drama, not about Christmas or Christmas themes. Yes, it's an excellent movie (which I would reccomend),but not for Christmas.  Holiday Affair I'd also never heard of, and was a cute delightful surprise. It Happened on Fifth Avenue is truly a Holiday Classic. I actually own this one and bought the collection for the others. If you just buy the collection for this one,its worth the money. Maybe with the Holiday Affair one as a bonus. The other 2 well,as I've said,one is not holiday at all and the other is fluff.",1351209600,8,862,4.904109589041096
4515552,5,B0050MB43A,"I purchased this video collection after my mother asked me to look for one of her favorites,""Blossoms in the Dust.""  This 4 pack seemed to be a terrific bargain.  We have only watched one of the movies (""Blossoms"") but I was pleased with the quality of the DVD.  (I enjoyed the movie as well.) As others have mentioned, there are 4 separate DVDs in a single case. I had not noticed in any reviews that this movie is in color. (I'm not sure about the others.) All in all the package is a good deal. Because the item qualified for free shipping, I selected another DVD collection to bring my total above the required $25.  I hadn't ordered anything from Amazon in awhile and forgot that the default setting was NOT the free shipping even though the order qualified for it. I was surprised when I saw the shipping charges, but when I investigated found out about my error (VERY DISAPPOINTING, AMAZON).  I realize some shoppers are willing to pay shipping charges for faster delivery, but come on, Amazon, the default for qualifying orders should be the free shipping option.  If not, then a cautionary ""You didn't select your free shipping"" pop-up upon checkout would be a sign of better customer service.
