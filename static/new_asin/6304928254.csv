947065,5,6304928254,"Hogan's Heroes is among the best of the military comidies ever made, and to all of those who thought they've seen every episode...think again! This tape contains the first (and formally unseen) episode ""The  Informer"" in its entirety. Although it is in black & white, it is  in my opinion, one of the best stories in the series, and of course has  become the model for the rest of theseries to follow. Great laughs all  around.",922147200,11,427,4.578947368421052

7880418,5,6304928254,"I read the reviews and followed recommendation to go with the VHS version because for some reason when the CD was made, scenes were cut. Worked great, no problems. Brought back good memories of watching the show.",1364860800,,212,4.756756756756757

7880420,5,6304928254,"It is criminal that the DVDs for Hogan's Heroes have not been produced...perhaps more criminal than the untimely slaughter of Crane himself.  There is a plethora of assorted crap and garbage, passing for entertainment, that has been lasered onto DVD.  However, the all-time gem remains unsung in the obscurity bin.  Brutal.",1080000000,9,323,5.294117647058823

7880422,5,6304928254,"Although Kinchloe(Ivan Dixon)was called by Ivan as you said, that was in only one episode that I can remember and he was called James in the others. It was probably a mistake (forgetfulness?) since they only said Ivan once.  Also, they have used names of others on the show in real life for this; ie: (Robert E.) Hogan.  (I haven't seen this in a long time since they stopped re-runs in my area, but I remember this well. It may not be accurate but it most likely is since Hogan's Heroes is a favorite show of mine.)",1038182400,4,516,4.309278350515464
7880423,5,6304928254,"The Hogan's Heroes 3 Video Gift Set is unfortunately not available in Germany so I had to come to the U.S. to buy it here. Although the price for postage & packing was higher than the price of the gift set itself, it was a good idea to do so, because I had the pleasure to see the original series and not the german version with the german translations. It is a 'must have' for every Hogan's Heroes fan even though the price in total was extremely high and the were some difficulties with the U.S. NTSC video system.",994118400,2,516,4.222222222222222
