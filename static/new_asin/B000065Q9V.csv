SYNOPSES for ""Sci-fi Classics Triple Feature, Vol. 1"":

CRASH OF THE MOONS-- Three episodes of the 1954 kiddie TV series ""Rocky Jones - Space Ranger"" retooled into a TV movie. Our hero, space captain Rocky Jones, must deal with the deteriorating orbits of a pair of moons that will put them on a collision course, killing all their inhabitants. Watch for John Banner (Sgt. Schultz in the CBS-TV sit-com ""Hogan's Heroes"") as Bavarro.

ROCKETSHIP-- The very first (and best) Flash Gordon serial, condensed and edited into a feature film.  After defeating a sea monster, Flash takes on Ming the Merciless, the declared ruler of Planet Mongo. Lots of action, spaceship battles, flimsy costumes, bizarre sets and wacky gadgetry.

THINGS TO COME-- Eeerily prescient H.G. Wells story has a second world war breaking out in 1940. After decades of fighting and destruction, plague kills off most of  Earth's population in 1966. The few survivors slowly rebuild and by the year 2035, a planned first voyage to the moon is threatened by a popular uprising against progress. Gap-toothed Terry-Thomas (the villainous Sir Percy Ware-Armitage in ""Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines"") appears as an uncredited extra.
