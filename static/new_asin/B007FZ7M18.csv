5084059,5,B007FZ7M18,"Ernest's Wacky Adventures: Vol. 2,from Image entertainment,includes Ernest Goes to School(released Dec/94),Ernest goes to Africa(released July/97),Slam Dunk Ernest(released June/95) and the 1984 TV special Ernests Family Album. There is a bit of a misconception here as the specs fully say a 1:77:1 a/r for these DVDs. The fact is these are the menu credits only. Furthermore the only MOVIE in w/s is Ernest goes to Africa,the rest are in full screen only. Also,the product description mentions the addition of My World As I See It. These were a compilation of clips of Varney's Astor Clement`s character from his TV show. Unfortunately,they are NOT included;I do not know where this incorrect info came from. These clips were complied in The Essential Ernest DVD set(see my review on that).Actually it is probably fortunate,because they should be re-inserted back into the TV show(which was released by another company)and the TV show re-released in toto,as originally aired.
Ernest Goes to School finds our hero Ernest as a caretaker at Chickasaw Falls High School. It seems a member of the board,who has his own agenda,has come by and demanded all faculty have their high school diplomas...including our lowly Ernest. He starts into studying but all his bravado can't make his grades any better. Two professors Bobby(Billy Burge) and Gerta(Linda Kash)come up with a machine that will make one instantly smarter after having used it. Ernest uses it and eventually abuses it,going to the heights then crashing down again. That board member's agenda has been discovered(he wants the school closed) and it is up to Ernest and his fellow students to save the day. A good entry in the Ernest cannon and the first time on DVD.3 stars.
Ernest Goes to Africa starts with two sacred jewels being stolen out of an idol somewhere in Africa. Ernest ends up finding them hidden away in a flea market and unknowingly uses them to make a yo-yo for his girlfriend Rene(Linda Kash).It seems a rich Raja has need of them and hires people to get them. However some of the people he hired,in turn hires others,so by the end there are about three different groups after the stones. Ernest,who is mistaken for a government agent along with Rene,end up in Africa as prisoners. They eventually escape and are befriended by the same tribe from whom the stones were stolen from in the first place. In the end the tribe gets its stones and Ernest doesn't get the girl. Confused? Watch it. Better than the reviews. 3 stars.
Slam Dunk Ernest finds Ernest and several co workers working as cleaning men for a mall. In their spare time Ernests friends play basketball and yearn for a chance to play in the NBA.Ernest asks and eventually gets a chance to be on the team,but is only,at first,a mascot. Eventually a basketball angel(Kareem Abdul Jabbar) appears to give Ernest some special shoes with which to really play ball. The magical shoes find the team,down the line,sitting on the bench while Ernest does all the work. Ernest will see the light and let the team make it on their own and get their shot playing for the NBA.Watch for Miguel Nunez Jr.as TJ,who would go on to star in his own basketball flick,the under rated Juwanna Man. 3 stars.
The final entry is the 1984 TV special Ernests Family Album. This is about as early as it gets for Jim Varney/Ernest and is a must to watch.
Technically speaking the films are clear and crisp. There is some graininess and I think they could all use a remastering and/or print striking.
This is Vol.#2 in this series. There are two discs here and this a must have for the Ernest fan;to finally get that elusive Ernest Goes to School. The other volume of course contains the other elusive Ernest Rides Again. The other two films have already been released,as has the Family Album(in The Essential Ernest).Even though the films themselves do not rate highly as such,I'm giving this set full marks as this is really FAMILY entertainment at its best,the kind one rarely sees anymore. It's the kind kids of all ages can watch together,without the parents wincing at a word or double entendre that the kids shouldn't be hearing. Highly Recommended.",1341187200,6,4161,4.861971830985915

8515993,4,B007FZ7M18,I'll keep this short and sweet this collection is actually good I understand these films aren't a-class but I grew up watching these classic my personal opinion on the drawback of this in dvd format is the volume can be extremely low & you will have to turn up your television in order to hear it like you'd want,1438732800,2,312,4.305084745762712
