8070162,3,B0009Y2M3U,"Thematically similar to the earlier, and somewhat superior, 'Lon: The Professional', 'Sara' is nonetheless a very entertaining film in its own right.

The picture quality of the digital transfer on this MGE released DVD is, however, poor. Colours look reasonably accurate and black depth is good, but the pixellation throughout is amongst the worst I have ever seen on a commercial DVD. Just about every diagonal line or edge is very clearly stepped and jagged. Text on signs, for example, which would be clear to read from most DVDs was displayed as an unreadable 'fuzz'. It definitely spoiled my enjoyment of the film.

I should make clear however, that despite the poor picture quality, the English translation subtitles were always clear and readable - though frequently so rapid it was impossible to keep up with them without pausing the playback.",1433030400,,852,5.078571428571428
8070163,4,B0009Y2M3U,"This is a good movie.  The bodyguard in the story has a job to do but things are complicated when the daughter of his Boss falls head over heals for him, after he saves her from certain harm and kidnapping.  She sees nothing wrong in their being together but he knows it will all be revealed ultimately and he will pay the highest price for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.",1413504000,,384,4.175675675675675
8070164,4,B0009Y2M3U,"This is the first film in Mehrjui's loose ""Iranain women"" trilogy (""Pari"" and ""Leila"" are the other two films) focusing on the struggles modern Iranian women face in a paternalistic, religiously conservative society.  It is a free adaptation of Henrik Ibsen's ""A Doll's House"" with Niki Karimi in the ""Nora"" role as the title character, a young woman who must compromise her husband's strict moral code in order to save his life, paying a price that would seem ridiculous in a less rigid society. It's not astonishing that Ibsen's Victorian-era proto-feminist work would adapt well to Iranian society 115 years later, but it is rather remarkable that the film comes off as well as it does, and is able to make as strong an indictment of the patriarchy and men's attitudes in general as it does.

For those who haven't seen a lot of Iranian cinema, it should be noted that the period from the late 80s through 2005 was a relatively more tolerant one for the nation's always ethically-questioning cinema; this film probably couldn't be made as easily today. Karimi (who also starred in Pari, the second film in the trilogy, and now directs as well as continuing to act), is quite remarkable at showing this young woman's gradual turn from self-sacrifice and unquestioning loyalty to assertive, courageous self-determination; remarkably she was just 22 when the film was released, but she already seems to have a lifetime of experience in this arena behind her. The satire on the unyielding Iranian bureaucracy and on the large chasm between the supposedly pious attitudes about Islamic money-lending laws and the reality is pretty cutting as well; I probably like Pari and the third film Leila slightly more, but overall this is an excellent work.

The subs are fine on this IRMovies disc; the image is slightly dark (noticeable most in the scenes set in Sara's house) but otherwise perfectly fine.  It would be lovely to see Criterion put out a set of the trilogy with perhaps some commentary by Mehrjui (who speaks nearly flawless English) but I'm not holding my breath.",1379635200,,2070,4.922636103151863
8070165,4,B0009Y2M3U,"If you like Tarantino, you'll love Sara. Great performances & enough bullets flying to make you duck behind the couch! Enough said",1347926400,,130,4.954545454545454
8070166,5,B0009Y2M3U,"An ex-special forces soldier (Leon) is hired to be the bodyguard of a local mobster's daughter, (Sara). They fall deeply in love with each other, but there are obstacles that stand in their way. One, the girl's father has already made plans for her future, and two, Sara is only sixteen and Leon is forty. They hide their love, knowing that if Sara's father discover's the two are lovers he really will kill Leon. Needless to say, her father does find out.

The first ten minutes of this film are really quite awful; some of the action shots are over the top and several parts are downright flakey, but I promise you will LOVE this movie! This is quite simply one of the most unique and original films I have ever seen. It's a cross between a mob movie, an action film, a comedy, and a love story. Once past the first few scenes the movie just keeps getting better and better. The last fifteen minutes are wonderful and the ending is one of my all-time favorites. I hated to see it conclude.

While the action is fast paced and exciting, the real core of the film is the love story between Leon, (played by the great Boguslaw Linda) and Sara, (real-life sixteen-year-old Agnieska Wlodarczyk). This is not a case of school-girl infatuation, or an older man seducing and taking advantage of a young girl. The love between Leon and Sara is the real thing and the actors do such a convincing job portraying this that the age of the characters becomes a moot-point next to the genuine love that compromises this relationship. Pay close attention to the song ""I'm Your Man"" that is sung as the final scene fades out. It is sung by Boguslaw Linda and the lyrics fit in so well with the concluding scene that you realize that the singer is actually Leon, finally able to express in words the love he has developed for Sara and it works into the film beautifully.

Along with action and romance, the director makes clever use of humor. This is a Polish movie and it is clear in some ways that the director was striving to emulate American mob and action films. When they're not shooting someone, or burying bodies in the back yard, one of the gangsters favorite activities is watching subtitled American films about organized crime; they seem to be mesmerized by them. I am an American, and I don't speak Polish, so this meant I had to use subtitles. Basically then, you have Americans watching a Polish mob movie in subtitles of Polish mob members watching American mob movies in subtitles. You just have to love the paradox there and I'm sure it was intentional on the part of the director.

In short, there is something about this film that just clicks. Once viewed, it becomes an instant favorite - one of those films you love to watch over and over again. I've lent my copy to many of my friends and have yet to have anyone tell me they disliked it.",1183507200,6,2845,4.507751937984496
