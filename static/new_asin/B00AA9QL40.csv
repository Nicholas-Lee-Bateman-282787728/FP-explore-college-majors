8548974,5,B00AA9QL40,This is great relaxing music by a great orchestra. I would order Berlin Symphony DVD's in the future. One of the best presentations available.,1399420800,,142,4.958333333333333
8548975,5,B00AA9QL40,"I was astonished by the performance of this work by the BPO/Rattle when I listened to it via ABC fm radio direct from the Sydney Opera House around the same time as this Singapore recording. At that time I realised that I just had to have it even though I have a few recordings already of Mahler 1. This dvd re-created for me that evening in 2010, where I remember an amazing feeling of being able to ""see"" into the orchestra to hear details I never knew existed. This is, for me, the greatest performance of a symphonic work that I have heard, live or recorded.",1373846400,6,562,4.311320754716981
8548976,5,B00AA9QL40,the Berlin Phil is so familar to me.  I know the first names of many of the muscieans.  It is one of the few symphony orchestras that records for DVD.  they are tops.,1372032000,3,166,3.9696969696969697
