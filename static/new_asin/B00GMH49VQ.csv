6086619,5,B00GMH49VQ,"As someone who has dined at Alinia, it was amazing to see the inspired vision behind it.  But what interested me most was seeing the juxtaposition of the three different restaurants/markets along side of the common theme of ""home.""  A very enjoyable film for foodies & those who like to observe the human condition.  I will probably watch this one again.",1395273600,,354,4.770491803278689
6086620,5,B00GMH49VQ,"Wonderful humans touchingly portrayed through their culinary and life ups and downs.  Very well constructed documentary, interesting to even us non-cooks.",1395100800,,154,6.333333333333333
6086621,5,B00GMH49VQ,"This is one of the best documentaries I've ever seen.  I don't normally write reviews, but this really moved me.  I expected a great documentary about restaurants and those who run them.  This was so much more.  I found myself falling for these people and really relating - sometimes laughing and sometimes crying.  It blew me away.",1394928000,,332,4.754385964912281
6086622,5,B00GMH49VQ,"At a crucial point in the film, the business partner of Grant Achatz -- the executive chef at Alinea in Chicago -- describes speaking to a doctor who is treating Mr. Achatz.  The doctor says that he may not only be able to save Mr. Achatz's tongue and jaw, but that same doctor may be able to save the patient's life as well.  The business partner's response?  ""Well, you're either a genius or you're crazy.""  The doctor's response?  ""Well, why can't I be a little bit of both?""  Supposedly, the two restaurateurs at that point knew they had their medical man.

And when you first start watching this documentary, you're not really sure if you have the best movie.  It does take a little time to get moving -- unlike most of the stars of this show, who get moving long before the sun comes up -- but once it does, this film just might move you.  It sure did me.  I don't like shedding a tear during a film, and I sadly admit that I did a couple of times while watching Mr. Achatz describe his cancer issues.

But  I will tell you this:  Mr. Achatz has some brass ones.  I kept thinking, ""Man, if I were in his shoes, I would surely just use those shoes to find me a very tall cliff.""  But that's not how this guy rolls.  Listening to interviews with his mentors such as Thomas Keller, you will quickly realize that Mr. Achatz is a truly special guy.

(They show Mr. Keller more than once here at The French Laundry, and I actually wish they would have featured him and his world-class restaurant even more.  Update on 2014Mar3:  my wife and I walk by The French Laundry at least once every two or three months, as we live near Yountville, and we really like that quaint little town.  Who doesn't?  Yesterday, we finally ate there, as we were lucky enough to secure an 11 AM lunch reservation.  Perhaps Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie cancelled last minute, since they realized that they had to be in LA for the Academy Awards that evening?  At any rate, the food is fantastic, but the service is even better; they seem to go out of their way to make you feel as if you're home, and they do better than a great job of making you feel comfortable with your dining decision.  But would I recommend it?  Well, sure, if you have the money I suppose.  Let's just say that there was a brand new yellow Lamborghini parked out front, and my guess:  whoever owned it was really the only person inside who could truly afford the experience without feeling guilty.  After all, you will drop just shy of a grand minimum for two people.  Yes; that is a one with three zeroes.  I will give the restaurant a 4.5 out of 5, if it were ratable on Amazon, of course.  End update.)

There are other players here:  a German family in Iowa who have had their restaurant burn down at least twice, and a Mexican family with their past money issues and current restaurant.  But the real star here, in my opinion, is Mr. Achatz.  But he, just like Mr. Keller, would argue that a chef is not the star; the star is the restaurant -- any one of those restaurants, as he now has at least two -- and that restaurant needs to carry on its own legacy long after the master chef is gone.

Why can't doctors be both geniuses and crazy?  And why can't chefs be cooks, philosophers, and painters?  I would argue that Mr. Achatz is all three, just like those three Michelin stars that his restaurant was awarded.  But I'll give five stars today on a truly modern-day moving picture.",1393027200,8,3440,4.332288401253918
6086623,5,B00GMH49VQ,"This movie started out as a film about food and then developed into a film about people, community, and families. It's a very unique and moving journey into what creating a meal means beyond the experience of taste.",1392595200,,215,4.684210526315789
6086624,5,B00GMH49VQ,"This film is about so much more than three restaurants. Its about people, family, and the triumph of the human spirit. This is truly one of the best documentaries I have ever seen. I'm so glad I can now watch it over and over again!",1392076800,4,232,4.177777777777778
6086625,5,B00GMH49VQ,"This film is about food, of course. But, it's not about food at all, really. It's about people, about love, about perseverance. I've been lucky enough to see this more than once, and every time I have been moved to tears. And I'm sure I will be again. Kudos to the creator, Joseph Levy, and his team!",1390953600,9,300,4.280701754385965
6086626,5,B00GMH49VQ,This documentary follows the amazing stories of 3 restaurants and the people who run them.  The three stories are interwoven to make a beautiful movie filled with heart.  I loved it and recommend it to anyone.,1390953600,5,209,4.777777777777778

6086632,5,B00GMH49VQ,"An amazing documentary about people, about food and most importantly about the passion that fuels their dreams.  My wife and I were glued to the screen, no breaks, no extra drinks, just watching.  This work captures your interest, holds it, feeds it to an unexpected emotional peak.  Just when you think you've seen it all and you're sitting satisfied with the movie, you are taken on a surprise recapitulation that left both of us weeping.  This movie touches the heart.  You just have to give it a viewing.",1437004800,,508,4.7272727272727275
6086633,5,B00GMH49VQ,"Spinning Plates is one of the better food-related documentaries I've seen. I particularly like the contrast between the three  different restaurants in terms of why they're open, especially the Mexican Restaurant, which proves desire isn't enough to be successful.",1434499200,,264,5.769230769230769

6086638,3,B00GMH49VQ,"I really wanted to like this video.  It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't great.  The story of Grant Achatz is poignant and heartwarming.  While he seems like a great guy, this video did not capture any of the passion that I'm sure he has.  Please know that I am absolutely not questioning his passion; I am questioning why the filmmakers didn't capture it.",1420761600,2,359,4.5625
6086639,5,B00GMH49VQ,"Beautiful film.  Touching story that really folds together -- passacaglia-like --  in the final third.  Common life threads of passion, finitude, vulnerability and love weave together thoughtfully for a powerful message.",1419811200,,220,6.032258064516129
6086640,5,B00GMH49VQ,This DVD will have u talking to all your friends about it . U get attached to the people and experience their highs and lows right along with them.,1419724800,,147,4.103448275862069

6086642,5,B00GMH49VQ,"I had to see this film because a few years ago I ate at Alinea, Chef Grant Achatz's restaurant. I was served dessert by Grant himself. It was one of the most memorable evenings in my life. Grant is a genius, and has such passion. I like to call him the Michelangelo of cuisine. He is so creative, and his plates are works of art.
After seeing this film, I want to jump on a plane to Chicago, and go there again.",1413936000,,411,4.024390243902439

6086646,5,B00GMH49VQ,"Chronicles the passion and commitment of those who are bitten by the restaurant bug.  It can come at a high personal price. The selection of three different approaches to nurturing the public is excellent and the film covers the wide range of challenges, risks and rewards that come with it.",1412208000,2,291,4.82
6086647,5,B00GMH49VQ,Excellent view into three very different yet also the same restaurants.,1409961600,,71,5.545454545454546
6086648,5,B00GMH49VQ,"I watched this film on Netflix and was strangely moved by it.  One reviewer asked where the food was but the movie is more than that.  Its about how restaurants are more than food...they are at times an extension of the owner or town they are in.  One restaurant was about the creativity of the Chef, the second restaurant really conveyed the connection between the community and the business, and the third was about family and achieving the ""American Dream"" .  I teach Culinary Arts and had to purchase this move to show to my students.",1406678400,4,538,4.572916666666667
6086649,5,B00GMH49VQ,AWESOME ...MY PASSION IS IN PIZZA......LOVED THEIR PASSION,1406246400,,58,6.375
6086650,4,B00GMH49VQ,Really gave you a lot of insight into what inspires a person to own and operate a restaurant. The sheer determination displayed by these individuals was inspiring to witness--we all should aspire to having such a passion in our lives.,1405814400,,234,4.875
6086651,5,B00GMH49VQ,"It was a beautiful movie on not only the chefs imaginations, culture,and presentation of their food creations, but on how the gift of creativity, saved their lives.  great movie",1402531200,,177,5.103448275862069
6086652,5,B00GMH49VQ,Very interesting stories of 3 restaurants and what they really went through.  We enjoyed it a lot! Interesting events and good human interests.,1401926400,,143,5.217391304347826
6086653,1,B00GMH49VQ,"The featured people could have been plumbers or truck drivers or ad men. Food was irrelevant to the story.
 Never saw a glimpse of what two of the restaurants served; and just a hint of the culinary magic at Alinea. Got real boring watching families discuss cash flow, child rearing and how much we love each other ...and our neighbors too. Another film maker with access to Alinea could have produced a gem rather than this saccharine soap opera. Worst was the patronizing treatment of the struggling Mexican family.",1401408000,2,517,4.808988764044944
6086654,4,B00GMH49VQ,We are a small bakery it was inspiring to see these three restaurants story. I could not see why they were selected at first but it all came together at the end.,1401321600,,161,4.0625
6086655,5,B00GMH49VQ,"Spinning Plates has won many awards and the stories in the film speak of the passion of three individuals as they strive to achieve the American dream.  Love for community, family, and desire to achieve heights in preparation of food kept me entranced.",1400371200,,252,4.8604651162790695
6086656,2,B00GMH49VQ,"This could have been a good documentary if only the ""storyteller"" knew how to write the script.
There is no energy or pace; just a scattered documentary of three restaurants and their owners.
It is only at the end when we read the dedication do we understand why these three restaurants were highlighted. But it still remains needing a better script.",1400198400,,350,4.754098360655738
6086657,5,B00GMH49VQ,It truly takes the heart of a lion to be in the restaurant business sometimes.  All three of these stories were so touching.  I never write reviews or rate something more than a 4 however this one deserves it!,1399420800,,209,4.333333333333333
6086658,4,B00GMH49VQ,It was an interesting to see the differences and similarities these restauranteurs ultimately have.  Can't wait to go to Alinea for dinner the next time we are in Chicago!,1398902400,,171,4.896551724137931
6086659,5,B00GMH49VQ,"A deeply moving account of the challenges, triumphs, & downright devastation of 3 very different restaurants & the family of folks who run them.

6086660,4,B00GMH49VQ,I really enjoyed this.  The director does a nice job of working through the three separate stories and brings it to a nice conclusion.,1398643200,,134,4.583333333333333
6086661,5,B00GMH49VQ,My new favorite food documentary!  These stories are more than the  food - they are about what is behind food and what brings people together around a table.  The stories are inspiring in ways that I did not expect - and I want to visit these restaurants for myself!,1398556800,,266,4.387755102040816
6086662,5,B00GMH49VQ,Loved it!  Very inspirational.  Can't wait to go to Iowa to eat at Breitbach's.  Grant Achatz is amazing and so talented.,1397779200,,121,4.666666666666667
6086663,5,B00GMH49VQ,"Very interesting movie about three different restaurants and how they serve the needs of their customers.  Very different type restaurants, but it shows the common needs that all eating establishments fill.",1396483200,,206,5.645161290322581

8624610,4,B00GMH49VQ,"Nice documentary about three restaurants, a struggling Mexican place in Tuscon, a family place in Iowa that has been around for over 100 years and a high tech modernist place in Chicago run by a talented world class chef.  Shows the overlap and differences between the three restaurants as well as lots of human drama. Certainly worth watching if you find food and food preparation interesting.",1515196800,,394,4.96969696969697

8624612,5,B00GMH49VQ,"You want to watch this movie. Trust me. The way they weave the stories together and tie it up with a big bow is delicious.
If nothing else, watch it for Chef Grant's story and food. He defines molecular gastronomy. All the stories are compelling. Watch it or don't (but do).",1476403200,3,274,4.392156862745098

8624614,5,B00GMH49VQ,"An amazing film. At first glance, one might expect the film to be about the food served at these three restaurants. It is that; the food is prominently featured. But this film is much more than that. It is a story of human flourishing, of creativity, of overcoming adversity. It is a masterful story made up of three stories. All three stories include people who survive and even triumph over tragedy. What makes it amazing is the way the filmmaker weaves the three stories together to tell the story of survival, and this survival is accomplished in community.",1472428800,,561,4.73469387755102
