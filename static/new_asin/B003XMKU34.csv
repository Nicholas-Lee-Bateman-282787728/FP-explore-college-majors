8408330,4,B003XMKU34,"The down-and-dirty:

If you've purchased any sets put out by Mill Creek in the past, then you should have pretty good idea of what you'll be getting with TEN THOUSAND WAYS TO DIE--average and sub-par flicks with average and sub-par audio/visual quality.  But the price is usually right, with each film cost-averaging out to about 50 cents a piece (as of this writing).

If you've not purchased any of these sets, then your enjoyment is going to be directly proportional to your expectations.  I like these sets for several reasons: number one is simply because I have an affinity for B-grade movies.  They may be bad, yes, but sometimes are surprising, wacky, bizarre, and have unexpected plot twists that can SOMETIMES keep me guessing.  Other times they are just bad--it's a crap shoot, but with collections like these, I usually find a few films I really enjoyed, a few that are ok, and a few stinkers.  Since I'm a cheapskate, I also like the price, and many of these films are either unavailable elsewhere, or put out in expensive, individual packages.  And even if many of them are in the public domain, and accessible with a little bit of searching on the internet, at least Mill Creek puts them all in one handy package.

If you are expecting classics such as THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY, you will definitely be disappointed.  This set struggles to attain the quality even of THEY CALL ME TRINITY, though it does have a few decent flicks in the mix.  A couple of other notes: three of these films are also put out in blu-ray editions by Mill Creek, and if any of those three were films that you were specifically interested in, I can tell you that the blu-ray editions--while not as pristine as a new film--completely blow away anything on this set (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Grand-Duel/dp/B007NYZ9YI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Grand Duel</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Last-Gun-Four-Dollars-of-Revenge/dp/B004HHX9L4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Last Gun & Four Dollars of Revenge</a>).  Lastly, by way of recommendation, I ended up buying the companion set to this one,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-000-MORE-Ways-to-Die/dp/B004ZJ9W7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10,000 MORE Ways to Die</a>, after watching the selections on this collection.

Packaging notes: As with all of the multi-film Mill Creek sets that I have (both 12 and 50 film sets), the DVDs come with four films on each disc, two on each side.  The DVDs themselves come in sleeves, which I think is actually better than having them pressed onto a hub, as it is impossible for the DVDs to get loose and flop around inside the case.  The case is similar to regular DVD cases, except that it is about twice as thick as the normal case.  I don't recall ever having an issue with playability on any Mill Creek disc I've had, and there were none here either.  Years ago, Mill Creek used to burn their logo onto the film print, and periodically throughout the film, you'd see the logo in the corner of the screen.  I don't know when they stopped doing that, but these films are free of the logo.  Still no subtitle options though.

Some technical notes: I viewed these films on a 52"" widescreen television and through a Sony blu-ray player.  I've tried to note when I found the transfer good, acceptable or poor; and the aspect ratio that the blu-ray player decoded.  I notice when viewing the same film on my computer monitor, the aspect ratio is not always the same.  The run-time I've listed is taken from the timeline when actually viewing the film.  Beside each title, I've listed a star designation for what I consider to be the entertainment value of the film.

BEYOND THE LAW:  3  stars.  110 minutes. 2.39:1.  Lee Van Cleef, Lionel Stander.  Despite the information on IMDb, the third actor is not Bud Spencer, but Al Hoosman.  Picture quality for this and THE GRAND DUEL are the best, very good for these sorts of collections.

THE GREAT ADVENTURE: 1 star. 87 minutes.  1.77:1.  Jack Palance, Joan Collins.  Kid's adventure story in Alaska.  Picture quality acceptable/poor.

HIS NAME WAS KING: 3 stars.  75 minutes.  1.77:1.  Richard Harrison, and the ever-cadaverous looking Klaus Kinski.  Revenge driven flick.  Picture quality acceptable/poor.

JESSE AND LESTER: 2 Stars.  93 minutes.  1.85:1.  Richard Harrison, Donald O'Brien, and a cameo by the great character actor Luciano Rossi.  Low-brow comedy about two mis-matched half-brothers.  Picture quality poorest of the set.

GOD'S GUN: 2  Stars.  97 minutes.  1.77:1.  Lee Van Cleef, Jack Palance, Leif Garrett.  Predictable story about twin brothers--one a preacher, one a gunslinger.  Only Israeli/Italian western I know of.  Picture quality acceptable.

IT CAN BE DONE AMIGO: 3 Stars (maybe too generous).  98 minutes.  1.77:1.  Bud Spencer, Jack Palance.  Very similar to a TRINITY film, but without Terrence Hill.  Picture quality poor.

THE GRAND DUEL: 3 Stars.  90 minutes.  2.39:1.  Lee Van Cleef.  Van Cleef fans will dig this, though it is also available on blu.  Picture quality very good.

JOHNNY YUMA:  3  Stars.  95 minutes.  1.85:1.  Mark Damon.  Smart-alecky gunfighter goes out to avenge his uncle.  Picture quality good.

SEVEN GUNS FOR TIMOTHY: 2  Stars.  87 minutes.  1.77:1.  Sean Flynn, Fernando Sancho (you've seen him in a million Italian Westerns, whether you know it or not.)  Take-off on the MAGNIFICENT SEVEN.  Picture quality acceptable.

THE LAST GUN:  2 stars.  96 minutes.  1.85:1.  Cameron Mitchell.  Masked hero story.  Picture quality poor/acceptable.

NOW THEY CALL HIM SACRAMENTO: 3 stars.  87 minutes.  1.77:1.  Michael Forrest.  Rip-off of the TRINITY films, but good for a couple of laughs.  Picture quality good.

FOUR DOLLARS OF REVENGE: 2  stars.  87 minutes.  1.77:1.  Robert Wood.  Framed cavalry officer out for revenge.  Picture quality acceptable.

As you can see, I didn't rate any of the films over 3 1/2 stars, but when considering the packaging, price, and convenience of having the films easily accessible, I was happy with the purchase.",1428278400,5,6168,5.2268993839835725
