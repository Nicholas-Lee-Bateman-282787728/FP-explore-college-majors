8485541,5,B005SUQ984,"I'm a rock & roller for the most part, but there's something about Loreena's blend of classical,celtic,mid-eastern,new age influences that really clicks with me. She's an exceptionally talented musician, & when you give her a dozen great musicians, & a historic,exotic venue like Alhambra, it would be hard to go wrong. Really well shot, excellent editing & wonderful sound complete the deal. I admire Loreena's many talents so much & now apparently she can also produce her own dvd, & do it really well. The music carries me away, what more can I say,this dvd will not disappoint fans & should gain her some more. I only wish she was a little more prolific, a new blu-ray would be my idea of heaven.",1333670400,5,700,4.699186991869919
