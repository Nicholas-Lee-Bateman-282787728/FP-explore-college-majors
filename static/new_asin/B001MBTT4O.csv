8320911,5,B001MBTT4O,"Mary Bronstein's film YEAST depicts the life of a young woman and her friends in New York. Unlike most such tales ,it shows a realistic view rather than a romantic view. The main character , unhappy with her room mate's lack of job, housekeeping skills, and communication, resorts to mean spirited bossiness. Her unhappiness seems to infect all her relationships. While this may sound dismal, I found it brilliantly funny, especially a scene where one of  her friends ,who is vegetarian, orders French Toast at a Burger King, while she has a Bacon Sandwich. The vegetarian friend insists on her wearing a cardboard crown. She resorts to petty food tampering to regain her sense of control. I suppose, control and being your own boss, after moving away from home and learning to be an adult among your peers, is what this film is about. Refreshingly, we are not presented with any easy answers. The acting, mostly other young NYC film makers, is brilliantly done. The cinematography is gritty and beautiful. I was surprised to find, having seen the film once at a screening some five  or so years ago, that I recalled many details of the shots vividly while watching the DVD.",1356393600,,1174,4.806930693069307
8320912,2,B001MBTT4O,"Maybe in fairness I should disclaim I watched Happy Birthday Harris Malden the same night as this (both Cinetic films) - which makes this fellow indie feel like it sucks the life out of what time you have to watch films.

This irritating hand held mess follows several lady ""friends"" as they eat, go to the bathroom with sunglasses on, walk, argue, drive, camp and pretty much bore the heck out of you. This got all kinds of wonderful reviews out of a film festival or two for those that enjoy this style of shaky-cam film making and improv, but it is not worth the price to get on demand.

There are no menus, sound options or immediate eject options once this spirals into full irritation level; proceed at your risk with the knowledge of the style and content, skipper.",1248307200,,772,4.507142857142857
8320913,4,B001MBTT4O,"Yeast is for people who like indie films--people who don't need Hollywood glamour or Hollywood endings.  This film is unattractive in every way possilbe--the cinematography, the actresses, their relationships, the way they speak/act toward one another.  If you believe that ""beauty is as beauty does"", these are some of the ugliest young women you'll ever see on screen--foul-mouthed, juvenile, dark, mean, and just plain twisted.

This movie overexposes each character's faults and darker sides, yet somehow lets glimpses of their better nature shine through.  Those moments, however, are found few and far between their bursts of nastiness and the obvious disdain they feel for one another in their alarmingly open contemptuous relationships.

If you want a ride on the darker side, this film is for you.  If you are honest, you may see a little bit of yourself in each of these characters.  Hopefully, you will be able to grow from seeing their apparent lack of growth and stunted emotional behavior or you'll want your 78 minutes and your self-perception as the perfect friend/person back.",1233964800,4,1093,5.211428571428572
