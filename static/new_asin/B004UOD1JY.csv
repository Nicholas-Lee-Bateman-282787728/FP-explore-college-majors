It's main character is a young guy with Asperger's who has moved out of his elderly parents house to live with his brother Sam, who I guess is a couple of years older than him. However his brother has a girlfriend, who really tries to make an effort and life better for Simon, but ultimately Simon's inflexibility, and disregard for her needs, her opinions and the fact that he walks in on her in the bathroom or while having sex with Simon's brother if they are not following Simon's well planned out schedule to the second, leads her to move out and break up with Sam. Sam convinced Simon the three of them needed to live together by telling him he needed his girlfriend to take care of him, like he takes care of Simon. So Simon starts freaking out over who will do the dishes, in frustration Sam tells Simon that she wasn't perfect, with one of the reasons, she doesn't make any noise when they have sex. So Simon decides to come up with a plan to find Simon a new girlfriend, by coming up with a questionnaire to ask women he meets, which included the sex question.

Simple Simon is a feel good film. It has humour from awkward situations and you can't help but like Simon (even though you probably wouldn't want to live with him yourself). Simon is sort of like a more realistic version of Sheldon on the Big Bang Theory, Simon doesn't quite have the superiority complex over others that Sheldon does. Because of the find a partner for his brother survey, it kind of reminded of a book called The Rosie Project by Graeme Simsion where a similar character to Simon, does a similar culturally taboo type thing called The Wife Project.

I don't why but for some reason some film Tamara Drewe keeps appearing as the image.  So I've attached an image of the actual movie DVD cover (for region 4).",1470614400,,1866,4.4662756598240465

8441867,5,B004UOD1JY,"Our family saw this film in 2011 at the LA Scandinavian Film Festival.  What a brilliant mix of story, emotion and character.  It's clever humor, raw realities of Asperger's syndrom, and sweet touch of fantasy makes it one that we still talk about and recommend.  We are SO disappointed that we can't find it in a format that we can enjoy in the U.S.  We even tried to find one of those international multi-format DVD players, but were told by several retailers that it's illegal to sell them in the U.S.  Go figure.  If ever you get the chance to see this film, DO.  If it ever becomes available on U.S. format, BUY IT.  It's one for the home collection for sure.",1358726400,4,664,4.385245901639344
