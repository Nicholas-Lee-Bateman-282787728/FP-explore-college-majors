7749366,5,B01F73IIG2,"A heart-warming comedy, the sound tracks in the movies are amazing, brought back a lot of memories in the 90's, (I'm looking for CD sound track for the movie now). I watched it with my 14 year old daughter and both of us laughed and sometimes had tears in our eyes. The movie also paid tribute to the culture icons in China/Hong Kong in the late 90's, it's no wonder on the top 10 highest box office in China of all time.",1505520000,,421,4.146341463414634

8760394,5,B01F73IIG2,Great movie with funny and wise bits about life. Loved the story and the 90's references and at times parody/copying the style of the cinema back then. I loved the message too and the music!,1526169600,,190,4.457142857142857

8760396,4,B01F73IIG2,"Movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles.  The first 30 minutes of this movie was difficult to watch as it wasn't making sense due to its not-so-funny humor and I was about to shut it off when suddenly the movie took a turn and got interesting.  The story is about a guy who wondered what his life would have been like if he did not marry his wife, and if he had expressed his love to the first girl he liked in high school.

However, he hits his head in the bathroom when his wife was chasing him down for being drunk and expressing nonsense to everyone at the wedding banquet of the girl he would have preferred to marry.  When he hit his head, he was transported back in time in which he gets a second chance to live his life again.  In this second chance, he chooses to do all the things he regretted he didn't get to do the first time.  He was living his dream life, becoming a famous singer instead of a struggling singer, married the girl he was into in high school instead of the girl who wanted him, he got to be the popular kid in school instead of the unknown kid, and everything he wanted in life.  What was interesting is that in getting everything he wanted, he also learned that what he had the first time around was actually more valuable to him and he would not have wanted to trade it for anything if he only knew that the first time he lived his life, he had made all the right choices.  It wasn't until he had the second chance in life that he realized the first chance in life was so precious.  The ending was great as it makes us think about our lives, whether we regret our choices or did it all work out just as it should (fate?).",1520640000,,1657,4.137071651090342
8760397,5,B01F73IIG2,"An excellent modern rendition of the romantic-comedy-time travel genre.  The directing, cinematography, attention to detail, comedy, and story are all top notch.  Totally didn't expect something like this from Chinese theaters.  At times I thought I was watching contemporary anime.",1520035200,,282,6.0
