8453387,3,B0051WTI8C,"Decent quality DVD. There are strolling lines ocassionally and a slight ghosting of images. Definitely watchable but I have seen better in the TVS Home Video series.
Merle Harmon and Fred Taylor have the call of this hard fought but very sloppily played game. At one point, I felt sure the game must have held the then record for most turnovers due to walking/traveling and double dribbles. The touted matchup of this showdown was Kevin McHale and Jo Barry Carroll. May not sound like much today but in the winter of 1980, it was huge. And they both delivered with creditable performances.",1307318400,,589,4.784313725490196
