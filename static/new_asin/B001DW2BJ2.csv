3540349,5,B001DW2BJ2,"This boxed set has 23 hours of classic tv. Not a bad price for that much. I disagree with one of the posters. If you read the back of the set it tells you exactly what programs are included, so you know Johnny is not on all the shows. Mills Creek may not be putting out digitally perfect cds, but you can't beat the price. If you like old tv you will love this inexpensive set. I have the Ozzie and Harriet set by Mills Creek and it's a great bargain too.",1252972800,12,455,3.9565217391304346
3540350,3,B001DW2BJ2,"Don't be misled.  This does NOT contain any episodes from the Tonight Show that made Carson famous.  Rather, this set features a few shows he did well before the Tonight Show, when he seemed uncomfortable with the lame foremat of the variety and quiz show.  He was quite thin, had black greasy looking hair and was just too slick all around.  It is of interest only to those who want to see from whence he arose to become one of the most powerful men in show business--ever.

There are other variety shows that have nothing to do with Carson, from the same period of the mid-1950s.  In fact, more than half the shows have nothing to do with Carson.  They are the ""and friends"" in the small print of the set's title.  The secondary shows also look a bit lame today, but there are some guests of interest, like Liberace, and some that faded fast, like Rod McKuen.

All in all, this is no better than fair and of more interest historically than for entertainment value.",1223769600,15,966,4.443181818181818

3540378,5,B001DW2BJ2,"I purchased this four DVD set primarily because it was SO cheap in price. And I am SO GLAD I Did. There is material in this set I HAVE NEVER SEEN, and I had some belly laughs viewing it. This is comedy from a bygone era. There is NOTHING that compares to it these days. In it you get to see how Johnny Carson's humour evolved. Remember his KARNAK routine on THE LATE SHOW? It actually began with a sketch on his 1950's CBS show THE JOHNNY CARSON SHOW, in an episode called DILLINGER THE MENTAL WIZARD. Johnny is so tongue in cheek I fell over laughing. Goofy, yes. Funny, yes. Vintage television- you betcha. Some of these episodes have the original sponsors commercials, like JELLO (""SEVEN FLAVOURS"") and LUCKY STRIKE (""IT'S LIGHT UP TIME!""). What a blast-before political correctness made paranoia a catchword in AMERICA.
Included are also a couple of episodes of WHO DO YOU TRUST?
This was a quiz show that required the contestants to have extraordinary knowledge of arcane history. For example, one of the quiz questions was to name the ten levels of officer ranks in the US NAVY.  Or name all the winners of the Forest Hills tennis tournaments for the last twenty years. (You had to be EINSTEIN to earn your five-hundred dollar prize).

The video and audio quality of the set is overall quite good, with the exception of a Bobby Darin show which is blurry and almost unwatchable.

But overall these discs are a delight. The real bonus is THE FRANK SINATRA TIMEX SPECIAL. Shown in 1958, this SPECTACULAR featured FRANK SINATRA, BING CROSBY AND DEAN MARTIN and MITZI GAYNOR singing some wonderful COLE PORTER and SAMMY CAHN standards and others. A CLASSIC 1950's TELEVISION MOMENT.

In addition, thrown in are other golden comedic tracks with other stars like JACK BENNY, SID CAESAR, MILTON BERLE, CARL REINER, HOWARD MORRIS, BOB HOPE, JERRY LEWIS and many more.
I recommend this collection to those who want to see what 1950's comedy television was REALLY like. I haven't laughed so hard in ages. And NOWADAYS, THAT'S SAYING ALOT.",1315872000,2,2034,4.737288135593221
3540379,1,B001DW2BJ2,"I thought this DVD was about the Tonight Show, not expecting much of the DVD to be of other shows, that had nothing to do with Johnny Carson. Very misleading title and has since been trashed.",1310860800,5,191,4.333333333333333
3540380,5,B001DW2BJ2,"Bought this for my Dad as well as a Johnny Carson favorite moments from the Tonight Show video; he absolutely loved this one as well. He can't stop talking about it, every time he watches some of it, he calls me to tell me about it. This was a great purchase!",1298592000,2,259,4.098039215686274

3540383,3,B001DW2BJ2,The title is very misleading since it is not the best of Johnny Carson and most is not about Johnny Carson at all.  I was expecting to see some of the Tonight shows but what you get is some of Johnny's very early shows when he was just getting started. That was interesting and would have been fine if they had also included some of his later shows. He was not so funny in his early days and the shows where he was the host of a quiz show were very lame. I did enjoy some of the Dean Martin shows. The old comedy shows are fun but the DVD is mistitled.,1296777600,2,552,3.9285714285714284
3540384,3,B001DW2BJ2,"These four DVDs are a mix of old time shows, including the Johnny Carson Show.  The quality isn't the greatest, but it isn't bad considering how old the original films are and the poor quality of television films were to begin with.  For the price ($5-6), one can't really complain about the quality.  It is an interesting DVD set to watch to gain some insight on what television was like back in the mid-50's.",1295827200,,410,4.513513513513513

3540387,2,B001DW2BJ2,"I had failed to read all of the available information on this set. I'd thought it was 23 hours of early Carson, which it was on 1 DVD and the first 2 segments on disk 2. On the Carson stuff, you could definitely see the evolution of most of the bits that became famous on 'The Tonight Show'. Way too many of the rest of the set were absolutely and abjectly boring and I LIKE a lot of the early shows from TV's infancy, seemed like these folks went out of their way to find the worst of it to show here. Oh well, read all of the info available here before deciding to buy, although, unlike one reviewer, I was well aware we weren't dealing with 'The Tonight Show' here. I was well aware Johnny Carson had a life and career before then and most of it was pretty good.",1284940800,5,765,4.072847682119205
3540388,3,B001DW2BJ2,"This CD arrived promptly in perfect condition. I was a little disappointed that all the shows were in black and white, Johnny Carson's early days on TV. He was and is still the best.",1282435200,,182,4.382352941176471
3540389,4,B001DW2BJ2,"This is a four disc set I found in a Wal Mart bargain bin for $5. I was looking for some good stuff of Carson, and it sounded interesting. The first thing a buyer should know is there is nothing from The Tonight Show on here. It is all from his early days with CBS. In fact, there is nothing on here past 1962, and it's all in black and white. The first disc is jam packed with many full-length (even commercials) episodes of The Johnny Carson Show. To me, it is the best disc in the set.

The other three discs feature other CBS shows of the period, many of which Johnny guest starred on. Disc two includes two episodes of Johnny's short run on ABC as a game show host, which was pretty funny as well. A lot of the shows on discs 2-4 are great to watch, but some of them can get a little boring. The gems that stuck out for me were the Timex specials, the Colgate Comedy Hour (a.k.a. The Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis Show - probably the biggest laughs in the set other than Carson), and The Milton Berle Show on disc four has its moments. The rest I could take or leave.

Overall it's a good set if you want to really get to see comic legends during and before their heyday. It's a bargain set, and for four discs if you enjoy classic comedy legends, it's worth the small investment of your time and money.",1266883200,9,1304,4.109803921568627
3540390,3,B001DW2BJ2,"These segments of Carson's earlier career may not have been what ""Johnny"" wanted to be seen and remembered as, but it is interesting this early stage of Carson comedy.",1262563200,,167,4.793103448275862
3540391,5,B001DW2BJ2,"I'm not a Johnny Carson fan in the slighest but I love this set!!  This is an awesome collection of super rare variety shows from the 1950's and 1960's, a potpourri of pioneering tv stars in 35 episodes of various programs! You get 16 very early Carson shows with such guests as James Arness and Eva Gabor, seven episodes of The Milton Berle show with guests including Ronald Reagan, The Andrews Sisters, Carol Channing, and Frank Sinatra; The Frank Sinatra Timex special with Dean Martin and Bing Crosby; a Jack Benny program; Bobby Darin special; two episodes of Sid Caesar's Hour, The Martha Raye Show with Edward G. Robinson, Two Dean Martin/Jerry Lewis Colgate Comedy Hours, three episodes of Shower of Stars with Jayne Mansfield, Vivian Vance, Jack Benny, Tony Martin, Liberace, and a super rare 1952 special Stars in Their Eye featuring Lucille Ball, Eve Arden, and nearly all of the CBS stars of the era!!  Many of these programs I would have gladly paid $10 each for - and here you can get all 35 in one package for around $10!! This may well be the best bargain on the market for lovers of vintage television seeking rare programs.

These are early television programs, often filmed on kinescopes rather than film so don't expect perfection in picture quality but it's generally very good indeed and certainly at that price you can't complain (although of course there will always be those who find something to complain about.)  I would have preferred for it to have been sold more as an all-star set rather than concentrating on Carson but then he does dominate the collection in episodes and has a higher profile today than many of the late greats to be found here.  I just love this set and often wonder if my deceased relatives saw these shows back when they first aired; certainly it's wonderful in recreating a wonderful era of show business long since vanished.",1254614400,22,1879,4.73394495412844
8295038,4,B001DW2BJ2,"If you're a fan of Johnny Carson and television shows from the 1950s, you will definitely enjoy this four disc DVD set with Johnny Carson and friends.

Disc One
The Johnny Carson Show: Dillinger The Mental Wizard
The Johnny Carson Show: Ed Sullivan Impersonation
The Johnny Carson Show: Evolution of Dance
The Johnny Carson Show: Goldlilocks and The Three Bears
The Johnny Carson Show: Life in the '80s (1880s)
The Johnny Carson Show: James Arness
The Johnny Carson Show: Jack Albertson
The Johnny Carson Show: Dimitri Tomlin
The Johnny Carson Show: Stay-at-Home Husband
The Johnny Carson Show: Eva Gabor
The Johnny Carson Show: Dorothy Shay
Carson's Cellar
The Johnny Carson Morning Show

Disc One is true to the Dvd collection title about Johnny Carson. You see him as a rising television star in the 1950s. This DVD is perhaps the best of the four to honor Johnny Carson.

Disc II
Who Do You Trust? Johnny Carson as host.
Who Do You Trust? Johnny Carson and Ed MacMahon.
The Jack Benny Program: Johnny Carson as guest.
Bobby Darin & Friends: Joanie Summers and Bob Hope.
Frank Sinatra Timex Special: Dean Martin, Bing Crosby
Timex All Star Comedy Show: Johnny Carson was host.
Caesar's Hour: Carl Reiner, Howard Morris and Nanette Fabray.
Caesar's Hour: Pat Carrol, Janet Blair and Sid Caesar.

Disc 2 started with two episodes from a game show program entitled ""Who Do You Trust?"" with Johnny Carson as host. The other programs featured Johnny's friends as well. He is not in the Bobby Darin & Friends; Frank Sinatra Timex Special or the two episodes of the Caesar's Hour. This Dvd displayed early television in its infancy. They also include television commercials as well.

Disc 3
Colgate Comedy Hour: Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis, Jack Benny
Colgate Comedy Hour: Dean Martin & Jerry Lewis, Burt Lancaster in a funny ""Come Back Little Sheba"" parody.
The Martha Raye Show: Edward G. Robinson and Cesar Romero
Shower of Stars: Jack Benny, Liberace and Jayne Mansfield (Mariska Hargitay's mother)
Shower of Stars: Tony Martin, Vivian Vance and William Frawley (Ethel and Fred Mertz).
Stars in the Eye: Jack Benny, Lucille Ball, Desi Arnaz Sr.

This disc has a few interesting episodes especially the Colgate Comedy Hour with a Lewis and Martin parody of the classic Burt Lancaster film, ""Come Back, Little Sheba. The only thing missing was Shirley Booth.

Disc IV
The Milton Berle Show: Danny Thomas
The Milton Berle Show: Frank Sinatra
The Milton Berle Show: Gertrude Berg, Andrew Sisters
The Milton Berle Show: Jackie Cooper and Vic Damone
The Milton Berle Show: Peter Lawford, Carol Channing
The Milton Berle Show: Ronald Reagan (President) and Dolores Gray
The Milton Berle Show: Zsa Zsa Gabor

The fourth Disc was unusable in my laptop computer. I would have liked to have seen it. The Milton Berle Show featured everybody but Johnny Carson. If you're looking for nostalgic television from the 1950s, this DVD collection is worth having for the fans. I enjoyed seeing a young Dr. Joyce Brothers.",1517529600,,3000,4.938492063492063
