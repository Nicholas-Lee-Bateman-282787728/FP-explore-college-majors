8447799,4,B000MGAWGE,I purchased this video because I'm restoring a 70 Bonneville and wanted to see somebody else going through what I've been going through.  It was fun to watch but not very detailed however I didn't expect it to be.  I would recommend it to anybody who is restoring or owns one of the motorcycles in the three bike DVD.,1392249600,,317,4.3559322033898304
