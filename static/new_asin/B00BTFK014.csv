5671552,5,B00BTFK014,"I am a great admirer of Korean culture and cinema. I liked this movie for the beautiful recreation of the time period as well as its excellent actors. Lee Byung-hun is one of my favorites and does a great job here in the leading role. For those who love korean historical movies, korean cinema in general, as I do,I recommend this movie.",1371513600,,337,4.451612903225806
5671553,4,B00BTFK014,"As far as I know the movie was shown at two theatres in my area (SF Bay) for a week, and then it was gone, and I've
been trolling Amazon and other sites since then attempting to buy it so that I can share it with others.  Its a fun historial drama, in which an irreverant noncourt jester is forced to masquerade as the king of Joseon when the real king is nonfatally poisoned.  He has humorous problems adjusting to life at court, which I don't want to give away, and problems dealing with politics, and in the end, with what will happen when his reign is ended with the return of the real king.  Humor, compassion, rightous anger, political intrigue, betrayal, and a beautiful girl make a good mixture.",1364947200,14,703,4.392307692307693
5671554,5,B00BTFK014,"""Masquerade"" (original title ""Gwanghae, Wangyidoen namja"") is a 2012 Korean historical drama that became one of the country's biggest hits of all time. Lee Byung Hun (""The Good, the Bad, the Weird"" ""I Saw the Devil"") plays the double role of the 17th century Korean King Gwanghae of the Joseon Dynasty, who is afraid of being assassinated, and a clown named Ha-sun, who resembles the monarch. When the King is drugged and in coma, Ha-sun is secretly whisked to the court, where he is forced to live as the King.

Only a few know the truth, which must be kept from the ministers vying for power. Even the Queen (Hyo-ju Han) devoted to the King must be kept in ignorance of what had happened. Ha-sun at first bumbles through official duties as the ""King,"" but as he comes to notice the corruption in the court, Ha-sun begins to think maybe he can change the country and life of the people.

Some understandably compare the ""Prince and the Pauper"" premise of the film with that of Kurosawa's ""Kagemusha,"" but I think ""Masquerade"" with its comical and melodramatic episodes is closer to Ivan Reitman's 1993 satire ""Dave"" in terms of tone. Lee Byung Hun (perhaps better known to Western viewers as Storm Shadow of the ""G.I. Joe"" movies) turns it into an emotionally charged drama playing dual roles effectively. Supporting actors are also great, with Seung-yong Ryoo (""War of the Arrows"") as Heo Gyun, the King's trusted politician, and In-kwon Kim as Do, fiercely loyal captain of the guards.

""Masquerade"" is a beautifully-shot and well-acted historical drama with humor and genuine emotion. This is a familiar story, but the story is very well told.",1364601600,34,1647,4.833333333333333

5671565,4,B00BTFK014,"This is probably the film that has gotten Byung-Hun Lee his Hollywood jobs. Probably a better film role than any Hollywood will ever give him, this is a wonderful dual performance. His sympathetic role as the put upon peasant who rises supremely to the occasion is the kind of role that used to get American actors Oscars in the earlier years of the Academy. The film is beautiful to look at and the acting is generally very good to excellent. Highly Recommended.",1476057600,,463,4.658536585365853

5671567,5,B00BTFK014,"Once again Byung-hun Lee out does himself. I swear this has to be by far one of  his best performances.

5671594,3,B00BTFK014,Great acting fromm Lee Byung Hun. But plot is a bit shallow and lacks complexity. The level of complexity is similar to a short Korean popstar drama.,1390867200,,149,4.555555555555555
5671595,5,B00BTFK014,"I saw this movie about 5 times already. I am hooked.  The acting in this movie is fantastic.  Filled with humor, history, and great costumes, I would recommend this movie to anyone interested in seeing a Korean movie for their first time.",1390089600,,238,4.642857142857143

5671597,5,B00BTFK014,"This movie is based on events that happened in Korea. I loved the cinematography, the story line and wardrobe. A story of forbidden love, conflict and selfishness. I was drawn to in and could not help but feel the main character. Highly recommend it .",1384560000,,251,4.6

5671599,5,B00BTFK014,"The actor Lee Byung-Hun shows his versatility as an actor in this movie.  He is better in the U.S. as an action star, so if you are expecting to see his ""moves"" you will be disappointed.  This is a well written story, and shows off Lee Byung-Hun's true talents.",1382227200,,261,4.3061224489795915

5671606,5,B00BTFK014,"Interesting and entertaining. Some of the things wouldn't make sense, but after all it's just a movie. You may be confused in the end of the movie if the story was based on true facts, but I confirm you that this movie is not based on a true story.

5671612,4,B00BTFK014,"I do not regret buying this movie. The price is great to begin with. Yes, we have seen this plot before, but for some reason, the Korean directors and producers always add some unseen touches to their productions which makes them fresh and new. This is no exception. The character actors are some of the best. The lead actor was splendid and carried the Masquerade perfectly. I really enjoyed it and so far, I have not been disappointed but maybe twice in my selections and I now own over 30 wonderful dramas and comedies. Koreans are very dedicated and talented people. They work very hard under difficult conditions at times. Watching Korean productions has opened a new world to me and taught me about a culture I did not know. I also buy K-Pop music from Amazon. Their selection is greatly improved.",1375747200,8,803,4.661971830985915

I found it a very moving and entertaining movie and one of the best historical dramas I have seen in a while. Political intrigue, love, patriotism, action, and you can't go wrong.

I bought this film expecting a war type action drama, but was in for a big surprise.  This film also grabbed my attention with actors Byung-hun Lee and Seung-Ryong ryu.  I have some other films with them acting and they execute their roles to perfection almost everytime.  I wasn't in the mood for a drama at the time, but this movie grabbed my attention from beginning to the very end.  After 15 minutes into the movie and no fighting going on I new this was a serious drama, but couldn't turn away.  The visual effects were awesome, the acting was awesome, and the humor in the film was executed perfect.  Most drama films with humor in them seem to be too much, but this film was based on history and this was suppose to be the personalities of the people that were being portrayed in the film.  Giving key points in this film will give it away, but I recommend to anyone who loves a great story with excellent acting.  Prepare for the emotional roller coaster during the last 15 mins of the film......5/5",1374105600,,1154,4.4523809523809526

I would not watch this movie if it was from my own cultural history (in English).  It was rather juvenile, but I enjoyed the film because the Korean culture is foreign to me. So, I was learning something.  It is a nice movie.",1373155200,,322,4.5

8573592,4,B00BTFK014,"I've become obsessed with Korean movies. As an American that's neither been to Korea nor knows as much about the culture as I'd like to, I must say I've been impressed by what I've seen overall. The storylines are every bit as good, and oftentimes better than ones in anything Hollywood can produce. I've found Koreans as they represent themselves to be remarkably open people - something Asians in general have been stereotyped to not be in the states. As for this move in particular, who would not be moved by a simple man of the people, though not raised to be king, inevitably rising to the occasion because of his love for his nation. A poor man showing affection and concern because he's been molded by a life very much different from one born to such a station.

I would've given this movie 7 stars if I could have, but we're not just reviewing a movie, we're also reviewing our ability to understand. I rented the movie from Amazon. The captions are lacking in their execution and timing - sometimes entire statements are not given a line of text in English so I could understand what was being said, and as I do not speak Korean, I feel as though I missed out on quite a bit that would've made the movie even more enjoyable for me.",1499990400,4,1240,4.43859649122807

It was nice to experience the historical perspective in a well acted movie with a fabulous sound track.  The color quality was excellent and reminded me of the days when real film was used.  I am looking forward to watching this film again with a Korean friend who speaks Korean.  I'll just read the subtitles, but there is an English sound track available from the configuration menu.",1489363200,,471,4.765432098765432
