6950655,5,B00S2SYW24,"Based on his book of the same name, this film exceeded expectations by showing a variety of patients and doctors who are handling dying in different ways, Dr. Gwande even shows how his own parents dealt with his father's death in a rational way, both being doctors and knowing what can happen when the cycle of extreme measures start. This is a film for everyone!",1440806400,6,363,4.6

6950659,5,B00S2SYW24,"Excellent presentation of a subject that needs to be addressed by all age groups: palliative care and end of life issues.  Difficult subject but must be talked about and thought about so as to normalize death and underscore that choices are available as to how one wishes to live their last days and knowing that thoughtful end of life care is available by trained professionals who will listen to the individual and follow through with their wishes. The individual forms a team composed of themselves, family/friends/ physician/spiritual resources to help with this process.",1436745600,3,575,5.182795698924731
6950660,5,B00S2SYW24,"This is Frontline at its finest. It contains real terminally ill patients, family members and doctors facing end of life decision making. Each patient featured in this documentary were brave and made the end of life choices memorable for the audience. However, the documentary needed to counterbalance the assertion about when/how/if it is appropriate for medical professionals to start palliative care. There was one disturbing scene where a palliative care doctor re-visited a patient and talked  with her without family members present. If there was a reason that her family was not in the room, viewers needed to know since they were present during a prior scene when the palliative care doctor was present.

The other element that I came away with is the Medical professionals are ill equipped to deal with medical issues that they cannot cure.  An interview featuring a medical ethicist or interviews with patient survivors who doctors gave up all hope on providing a perspective would have provided a more complete view. Overall, this show was one of the best Frontline episodes. If you are in the process of creating a  living will  or estate planning, watch this episode before making decisions.",1431734400,5,1204,5.122448979591836
6950661,5,B00S2SYW24,"I heard of a survey that they proposed three different scenarios to the participants with surprising results;
1. To be sick and alive,
2. To be really sick that will requires constant attention or not alive,
3. To be terminally sick in a hospital bed with hardly any movement or not alive.
The participants chose to be alive and in those conditions respectively 33% of the time for each condition rather than not being alive or not being in pain and almost in vegetative state.

What that survey shows is that many individuals want to stay alive and do not want to face death regardless. It is different for each individual but it helps one if such issues are addressed with one's faith, belief, philosophy well in advance instead of later. I wrote my HCD pretty early in life. I am a donor and have signed up with ANATOMICAL GIFT PROGRAM so if possible, I may be useful to someone needing organs or few graduating students in a medical school who need to practice their trade in advance. Doctors cannot control aging and death. I have done myself the biggest favor of all by dealing with my HCD when I could think clearly and I have never changed my mind. This is my life and I have no intention to allow anyone to speak for me. More importantly, I have no reason to be inconvenience to anyone since that is not what love is all about.

QUALITY LIFE is the medical term used by physicians not to offend patients when they happen to be discussing death and you will witness few in this documentary. Thanks to those thoughtful and caring professionals as well as those compassionate human beings who allowed cameras in their lives, knowing death is a difficult issue to address. This is a superb documentary that gently and kindly tries to help individuals to understand and comprehend that medical practice is not designed to address many personal choices when it comes to life and death. It should be the responsibility of every single individual to address such issues in advance, in writing, properly, accordingly and thoughtfully. Bravo, bravo, bravo.",1426032000,5,2055,4.689750692520776
