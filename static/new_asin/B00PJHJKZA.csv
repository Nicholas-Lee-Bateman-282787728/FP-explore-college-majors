6809066,5,B00PJHJKZA,"I'm always a little nervous about purchasing movie collections as they often turn out to be cheap copies that have a high risk of playback issues. These did not. Great quality DVDs, and very fun, action-packed story line. Robert Downey Jr portrays a unique and exciting Sherlock Holmes, and Jude Law supports as an excellent Dr Watson. The movies support the spirit and character of the original books while twisting the stories to add a new flair. Great fun to watch, even for a *somewhat* dedicated Sherlock Holmes fan.",1485734400,2,521,4.865168539325842

6809085,5,B00PJHJKZA,"I enjoy Robert Downing, Jr in the ""Iron Man"" & ""Avenger"" movies. He & Jude Law really played off each other well & the humor is great, but it isn't a comedy as much as a mystery/action.",1452038400,2,185,4.027027027027027

8688291,3,B00PJHJKZA,Okay.,1524528000,,5,5.0
8688292,5,B00PJHJKZA,As expected. Excellent movies. I rarely watch movies more than once. These movies are worth watching again and again. The dialogue is quick and funny but you don't realize how wonderfully dense it is without several times watching them.,1516579200,,236,5.076923076923077

8688296,4,B00PJHJKZA,"Sherlock Holmes 2 pack Bundle I bought at the local walmart in the 5 dollar bin so yes great price for two movies.  I personally enjoyed both movies but have to be honest Game of Shadows had a better plotline and actions scenes.  Robert Downy JR and Jude Law amazing performances for their characters and as many other fans of the movies I will also be looking forward to the 3rd movie when they choose to actually film it.  I also thought the villain was better choice in Game of Shadows, but buy the movies and see for yourself how good the movies are and side note enjoyed the camera work when Sherlock Holmes notices everything around him and takes it all in as he plots out his next moves or movements.",1501804800,,707,4.340909090909091
8688297,5,B00PJHJKZA,When not in the armor. Downey Jr. plays The Greatest Detective. These two movies are incredible.,1498176000,,96,5.0625
