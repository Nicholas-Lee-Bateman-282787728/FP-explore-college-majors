8424552,1,B004CZVLDE,"I' m very disappointed with this dvd, sound is terrible, video quality is very poor, was expecting better quality for that price, there is no way a teenager would stop to watch this video, we need something more up to date to catch their attention, other than that the service from this seller was great, fast delivery and product was well protected.",1297036800,,350,4.661290322580645
8424553,4,B004CZVLDE,"this dvd contains 5 chapters of short films.  I found the chapter on ecstasy very helpful (chapter 4).  Also learned a lot from the chapter where adolescents are interviewed and they describe the damage that alcohol and drugs have done to their young lives already (chapter 5).

Another interesting chapter describes, in medical terms, the process of detox for a patient, and the symptoms of withdrawal just prior to detox.

Still another chapter educates the viewer on the symptoms of barbituate / sedative intoxication.

* recommended viewing for those who work in the substance abuse field.",1296432000,,593,5.135416666666667
