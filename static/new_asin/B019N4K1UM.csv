7576504,3,B019N4K1UM,"It looks great, and the cast and creatives are excellent. The premise is not simply Dickens characters given new plots, which might have worked had they been AFTER their original plotlines. Since they are all BEFORE their original plotlines, you already know how it will end for most of them--and for most of them, it won't be very happy.  That also means that two of the major plotlines are driven in turn by a psychopath and by a manipulative neurotic. They're that way in Dickens, but they're both minor, backstory characters. Here they're front and center, and you spend too much time wishing a load of bricks would fall upon them.",1533772800,,635,4.7207207207207205

7576510,4,B019N4K1UM,"Dickensian is a BBC drama that only aired one season. Clever in the way it combines the lives of Charles Dickens many characters, this story tells of Inspector Buckets attempts to solve Jacob Marleys murder. Unfortunately for Detective Bucket, everyone has a motive to kill Marley. The problem is finding out who truly is responsible.

This superbly cast drama may please Dickens fans. However, it should be noted that this is a serious drama, with little comedy, and in keeping with many of Dickens characters, it does not end well for every one. (In other words, this is not a happily-ever-after type show.)

I was unable to find what the TV show was rated. I would guess it is about TV-14. However, there were a couple scenes that made me a little uncomfortable. The main one of which is when Silas Wegg forces himself on Mrs. Gant. While they are clothed in the scene, it was disturbing enough for me that I ended up turning the show off. So I would advise people who are sensitive like me, against watching the show.

I did go on Wikipedia to find out who Joseph Marleys killer was, and that is why I know the show does not end happily for everyone. So, if you are in the mood for a happily-ever-after show, look elsewhere.

I will reiterate that I was beyond impressed with the acting  Scrooge and Fagin being my two favorite characters, closely followed by Detective Bucket. I appreciate the shows cleverness in how it combined many of Dickens books; however, this show is simply not for me.",1532822400,,1498,4.595505617977528

7576531,1,B019N4K1UM,"I watched the entire series. Drawn in with the idea of entwining lives of different novels ...it was a novel idea. I love Charles Dickens work but it was poorly done. The ability for redemption was not there the hope people love to hang on to obviously absent.  The ending did not match up with Dickens originally loved novels. Esther was not raised by her aunt but was given to Mr. Jaggers as the supposed red haired child that Amelia raises. Oliver was kicked out of the poor house with no sensible tie back to his family. Dont watch it not worth the time. They have a character who is really good a twisting things as they themselves twisted this tale right out of alignment with there origin counterparts. It is dark and took my hope and left me in a confused dark ally. That is never what I expect when I pick up a Dickens novel. Not family appropriate, no lessons learned here, and a disgrace to media adaptions for Charles Dickens work.

If I already know what's going to happen (and I've also seen multiple OTHER film adaptations of each one of these), what's the point? I was hoping they'd throw in some twists here and there... give Honoria and her lover a happy ending perhaps, or make Amelia a strong and clever woman who doesn't fall for Compeyson's nonsense.... but no, it's the same tired narrative we all already know.

The entire 10 episodes were a ""scrambled eggs'"" of all of his books, hence there were lots of characters to keep straight.  It was like a soap opera with many plots, subplots and Sub subplots and a few that just stopped instead of ending.  In the first episode old Jacob Marley is murdered and the next episodes through nine is the detective chasing a suspect one after another.  In the end I was surprised at the who-did-it.  There was one nude scene, which really didn't have purpose.  A man stood up in the bathtub with a complete back view.  This didn't need to happen.  And, how can a woman...not a lady even though she think she is one...wear a cross around her neck be so evil????  I watched in two days.",1527638400,2,799,4.417808219178082

People have to realize this is not a story following exactly to any one of Dickens' novels, it is rather, a story written and acted with characters from many of Dickens novels, none necessarily exacting in the original Dickens' stories....basically a murder mystery in the realm of Dickens' characters.

7576554,3,B019N4K1UM,"Maybe I shouldn't be writing this review now since my wife and I have only watched 10 of the 20 episodes.  But it's too late to send back the dvd to Amazon and I might be able to prevent someone else making the same mistake I did in ordering ""Dickensian"" or waiting too long to send it back. I don't consider myself a Dickens expert but I have read a number of his books, including ""Great Expectations,"" ""Hard Times,"" ""A Tale of Two Cities,"" and ""A Christmas Carol.""  My wife and I have also seen the dvd's on these titles, as well as ""Oliver Twist,"" ""Bleak House,"" Nicholas Nickelby,"" ""David Copperfield,"" ""Dombey and Sons,"" ""The Old Curiosity Shop,"" ""Martin Chuzzlewit,"" ""The Pickwick Papers,"" and others.  The vast majority of these stories have sympathetic characters, a constructive message, and a decent, if not happy, ending.  ""Dickensian,"" on the other hand, has virtually no sympathetic characters, with the possible exception of the police detective who is trying to solve the murder of Jacob Marley.  My wife and I care for none of the other characters and don't see much of a chance for the redemption of Mr. Scrooge or any one else.  Most are drunken sots or ne'r-do-wells and some, like Mr. Compeyson, are just plain evil and psychopathic.  Charles Dickens must be rolling in his grave thinking about how his works and characters have been so corrupted and his audience be left in such despair.  When we finally finish watching all the episodes, I can write an updated review, but I don't see much chance of it being better than the one (1) star I'm giving it now.  No wonder this series was cancelled after its first and only season.  What a waste of acting talent, scenery, and a promising idea for continuing Dickens stories.  All but masochists should steer away from this dvd.  --Jim Wheeler, Tucson, Arizona
5/5/18 Update: I submitted an earlier review after my wife and I had seen the first 10 of the 20 episodes in this series.  We gave these episodes a low rating of 1 star out of 5, as we were rather disappointed.  The characters, with the exception of Detective Bucket, did not seem sympathetic at all and there seemed to be no hope they ever would be.  Since then, weve watched the remaining 10 episodes and the Bonus Features.  On the whole, we still were disappointed with a lot of what we saw but must say that the last 3 episodes were rather good.  Not to wreck the story for anyone else, but the real murderer of Jacob Marley is discovered and an appropriate treatment of the person is forthcoming.  The sinister Meriweather Compeyson is unmasked and is frustrated in his attempt to steal the Havisham fortune.  Scrooge gets his visit from Marley in one of the fleeting final scenes. The Barbary sisters are reconciled, although the elder one conceals the true fate of her younger sisters illegitimate daughter.  And the ending suggests that the illegitimate daughter of Honoria Barbary will probably become Estella, who later turns into the young female ward to Miss Amelia Havisham.  As later revealed in Dickens novel, Great Expectations, Estella becomes the lifelong love interest of our hero, Pip.
Holding aside the novella, A Christmas Carol, Great Expectations is my favorite work of Charles Dickens and has been made into several movies and made-for-TV dramas.  The best of these, in my opinion, is from 1999, and stars Ioan Gruffudd as Pip, Justine Waddell, as Estella, and Charlotte Rampling as Miss Havisham.  Readers and viewers who haven't seen the dvd must get it soon before it goes out of print again.  Another fine production of the story goes back to 1946, with John Mills in the role of Pip.  David Lean was director and co-screenwriter; Alec Guinness appeared in his first feature film, as Pips friend, Herbert Pocket.
Back on Dickensian, there was so much promise in this production it is a shame that something better wasn't edited and released.  Despite the meticulous sets, lavish buildings and streets, lighting of same, and great casting, too much time was devoted to minor annoying characters, like the Bumbles, Ms. Gamp, and others.  Supporting characters, like Fagin, Detective Bucket, Bill Sykes, Arthur Havisham, Nancy, the Cratchits, Mr. Jaggers, Mathew Pocket, and Mr. Venus all did well but more focus should have been drawn to the main characters in the story: Miss Havisham, Mr. Compeyson, Scrooge (and his redemption), and to Arthurs final fate.  Probably the supporting character we appreciated most was Detective Bucket, played memorably by Stephen Rea.  Not to give away the story but his handling of the Marley murder case was scientific, yet heart-warming in the end.
As said above, we gave the first 10 episodes a low, 1-star rating.  Episodes 11-17 rate a 2.5. And the last 3 episodes, 18-20, get 4.5 stars.  Bonus Features were quite good, including interviews with all the main players, and also rate a 4.5.  So, overall, we give Dickensian, 3 stars.  We cant recommend the series to anyone but Dickens fans; nevertheless, even these may find numerous faults and other problems with how the production has been constructed.  The relative lack of sympathetic characters and hope presented in the beginning never is fully redeemed at the end.  The inconclusive ending begs for a sequel that will probably never come.

7576556,5,B019N4K1UM,"One of the best ""fan fiction"" series I've ever come across. BBC was nuts to release it as a 30minute drama, which is probably why they ended up canceling it after only one season. Netflix understood it was better suited as an hour long drama and had it prepackaged as such when they bought it. Hopefully Netflix will strongly consider ""green-lighting"" a second season or, at the very least, a limited series to pick up where this left off. Fantastic writing, acting, directing, costumes, sets... I couldn't find a single problem with this series. Watching all of these character's lives intertwine was an absolute treat.

This one season tells a complete story. It tied up all the loose ends. So don't worry that a call for a season 2 is because there was a cliffhanger. There wasn't. And if you know the stories of the characters here then you know what happens to them going forward. But it would be so much fun to see what sorts of other things they may have gotten up to if we were given a second season of ""Dickensian.""

Clearly this series was created by fans of Charles Dickens' work. Not unlike when Peter Jackson took on ""The Lord of the Rings"" and was a stickler for staying true to the source material, as much as was possible. When adapting a novel to a film or series, true fans will usually create the best product, as is the case here. How fun it was to figure out who was whom from among the characters, and from which story each of them originated. It's also, in my opinion, nice to see Mr. Dickens' desire to deliver a (completed) murder mystery come to fruition.

Based on what I've skimmed over, the negative reviews should be disregarded, unless you're an academic with a strict appetite for literal representations of the written word. In which case you shouldn't be interested in this series anyway since it does not claim to be an adaptation of any of Dickens' works, but rather is an expanded look into the lives of some of those characters from those stories. A look, I should add, that sticks largely to the facts as Mr. Dickens presented them. This series is pure fun! A delight and a surprise from start to finish. And quite a good who-done-it too.

I get that 19th century London was hard, with many hardships, but the entire movie was dark, literally. Almost every scene took place either in the dark of night, or in rooms with no windows or light. It hurt my eyes after awhile. Also, there was bad language, unnecessary innuendoes, pointless nudity and much of the dialogue felt more like an ongoing soap opera than a Dickens' story. Perhaps the intent was good, but the delivery was very bad. I ended up making it about half way, then turned it off for good. What a disappointment.",1520812800,10,669,4.583333333333333

7576586,2,B019N4K1UM,"I LOVE the idea of the Dickens characters all being alive at the same time and having interwoven story lines. Unfortunately, it just feels ""off."" Why is Tiny Tim alive if the story starts the Christmas eve that Marley dies? He should either be a baby or not even born yet. Why is Honoria Barbary's family on the verge of bankrupcy? She married a baronet. Surely she wasn't a shop girl or else she wouldn't be friends with Haversham or a candidate for marriage to Sir Dedlock. Why is Detective Bucket such a dunce? Is there ANYONE he hasn't arrested?

Some of the characters are only peripheral to the story, but it's nice to see them nonetheless. You think you're going to get a story, but it's just a fragment that leaves you dangling. If you wanted more, that could be something, but instead I was like, ""so what? Who cares? Why did you waste my time?""

The episodes are about a half hour each. That makes it easy to pop it in and leave. This is good because it's about all I can take at once.

Dickens was an expert at creating complex characters and weaving their storylines into other people's lives. This doesn't do that. It feels like someone who doesn't know women or people wrote this. They are all one note. The acting in some places is really off too. Not sure if it's the actors or the writing. I don't know any of the actors so it's hard to tell.

And this is played on a US DVD player (region 1)

All in all, it's a soap opera. Dickens may have written soap operas, but he did so in an ""edge of your seat"" fashion. This just felt like the same story kept playing over and over with no furthering of the story, no growth of the characters, and no entertainment value. This could have been improved by making it half the length.",1514764800,2,1740,4.308868501529052

7576591,2,B019N4K1UM,"Could have been great ...

... if it had better writers. Sadly they were not up to the task of writing what could have been a gem of a series. Instead:

- This program perpetuates the seemingly common misunderstanding of Dickens' work (and Victorian literature in general) that it's all bleak, all darkness and misery. Dickens (and other Victorian writers) often strove to balance the dark and evil with the good and funny. Yes, Dickens's writing was full of humor, yet this program has none (except a few very feeble attempts). If I were to change the setting to modern London and the characters' names, I'd swear I was watching East Enders, not Dickens. It's all dark and gloom, dark and gloom, over and over and over again.

- The writing here is so full of filler that we get the same story points made over and over and over again, ad nauseam. It's as though the writers had enough material for maybe eight or ten episodes but were told to stretch it out to twenty. I won't bother listing those here, as some reviewers on amazon.co.uk have done a good job of enumerating them.

- Unnecessary modernizations are added that do not improve or strengthen the original characters or stories, but weaken them.

- Continuity gaffes abound. For example, if Marley was still alive and dies on Christmas eve, the story time would be seven years before A Christmas Carol, yet Tiny Tim is about the same age as he would be seven years later, a pretty amazing feat of anti-aging.

- Despite Dickens' works brimming with good characters, I can't really see any except for Bucket and Venus. Maybe Mrs. Cratchet. But even Bob Cratchet is shown cooking the books to reduce his own loan terms. Come on! And on that point, would Scrooge really have kept Bob on upon learning of his shenanigans? I doubt it. I think Scrooge would have pressed for charges to be filed, unless he felt that Bob showed promise in being as cruel and heartless with money as he was, but then if that happened, we wouldn't have the story of A Christmas Carol.

Despite these and many other problems that would especially irk Dickens fans, I stayed with the story through nine episodes because for the most part the production was very good and the acting top notch. But the clincher for me came when Compeyson drowns Jip in the canal. I gave it one more episode in the hopes that this cruelty was somehow an illusion, but no more mention was made, so that's it, I'm done. I won't even put the set up for sale, because I don't want someone unfamiliar with Dickens to buy it and think that this kind of crap is what made Dickens great. It's not. It's just a soap opera with a Dickens coating to fool the audience. Very sad.

I should have waited until Britbox or Acorn carried it instead of buying the DVD. I recommend prospective viewers do the same, especially if you like the REAL Dickens.",1512950400,12,2852,4.524271844660194

""Dickensian"" is a 20-episode British television series (30 minutes per episode) based on the characters of nineteenth century English writer Charles Dickens. These teleplays are not dramatizations of Dickens' stories; instead, they present us with backstories of characters from many of Dickens' novels, placing them all in the same London neighborhood at the same moment in time. Most of the characters seem to from the following works by Dickens: Great Expectations; A Christmas Carol; Bleak House; Oliver Twist; The Old Curiosity Shop; Our Mutual Friend. A few minor characters are drawn from other works. I was disappointed that Little Dorrit was not included. I am very impressed with the loving care that went into creating this series. Fortunately, I had recently re-read most of these novels. If you are a fan of Dickens, I think you will love this series.

While this series accurately pays homage to Dickens' characters, it failed to match the spell-binding plotting of Dickens. Also, if you remember the novels, then you will already know what is going to happen to most of the characters. For example, we all know what is going to happen to Miss Havisham and the future Lady Dedlock. If you have not read the novels, then you will probably be confused much of the time. Also, there is too much repetition in the series. For example, how many times can one enjoy a scene in which Mrs. Bumble is nagging Mr. Bumble with the same complaint?",1498089600,22,1532,4.888461538461539

7576597,5,B019N4K1UM,"This television series is true to the spirit of Dickens in that it looks sympathetically at the lives of the poor and the disadvantaged, particularly women. The female roles are are strong and the series' creators have used well known characters such as Nancy and Honoria Barbary intelligently and convincingly. One exception is Miss Havisham whose strength is her weakness, her stubbornness leading to the disaster we know awaits her.

If you are knowledgeable about Dickens' stories this will enhance your enjoyment as you will marvel at how the creators have re-imagined many of his characters. None is inconsistent with the original. The various plots will keep you intrigued as they weave deftly in and out of each other. The main plot focuses on Inspector Bucket's hunt for Marley's murderer and in Dickensian style, draws in social criticism and has a modern sensibility. Dickensian humour also abounds, as does tragedy.
