8550808,3,B0018E8JNC,"I gave this three stars less for its own merits and more for the fact that there aren't any good alternatives to compare it to. It's OK as an introduction to what plastic are, but altogether very outdated- the Amazon description says that the DVD was released in 2008, but that must be a RE-release after it sat on a shelf for 20 years. The data and technologies described are old, as are the classic 1980's clothes and hairstyles featured. Ironically, the narrator touts the wondrous research being done to make plastics more recyclable, such as being able to turn them back into oil or make them efficiently biodegradable...and two decades later we have made little progress with these ""advances"".

The first 5 minutes of this ""documentary"" sound like a paid promotion from the American Chemistry Council exclaiming the wonders of plastics and how important they are. The whole thing is very slanted towards promoting how valuable and great plastics are. Despite the title, less than one minute is spent on the disposal, energy consumption or other long-term problems. Toxins or afects on human health are not mentioned once. Less than two minutes is spent on the recycling options and processes.

All in all...unless you want to use this as a basis for a much broader discussion that you're prepared to do additional research on, forget this DVD. It does not present modern, accurate, unbiased information.",1321920000,,1409,4.966101694915254
