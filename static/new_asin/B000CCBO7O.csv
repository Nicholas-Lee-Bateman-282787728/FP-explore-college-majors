8096971,4,B000CCBO7O,"Full Circle is the first of 3 Dr. Who stories of E-Space, (also, State of Decay and Warrior's Gate).

This one concerns the Doctor, Ramana and K-9 encountering the descendents of a crashed starliner, Mistfall, transfiguration and marsh creatures.

This story introduces Adric, one of the Doctor's most arguementive companions.

I find it interesting the way some writers make Romana weak and meak and some make her intelligent and resourceful.

In this one she's weak and meak. After getting bitten by a large local spider she falls under the infuence of

the marsh creatures. The Doctor needs to solve multiple problems and time is short as the marsh creatures attack the starliner.",1168128000,,683,5.0625
