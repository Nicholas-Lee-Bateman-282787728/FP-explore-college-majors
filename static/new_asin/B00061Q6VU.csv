2157293,4,B00061Q6VU,"I'll just get this out of the way right now: Ryuhei Kitamura is one of my favorite directors.  He's the Japanese equivalent of our Quentin Tarantino or Robert Rodriguez.  He has an eye-catching visual style, the talent to write entertaining dialogue, and nobody in Japan does action better.  He's also able to take pure cinematic cheese with elements of other genre films and meld them together in exciting ways that seldom fail to entertain, even if you occasionally roll your eyes.  I'm also a lifelong kaiju fanatic who grew up watching Godzilla and Gamera on Saturday afternoons and saving up my shoddy allowance to buy the films on VHS.  Ah, memories...
That said, my excitement level over this film was naturally huge.  I consider the millenium series of Godzilla movies to be among the greatest, boasting decent special effects and serious storylines which past kaiju films were known for lacking. This movie takes all of the improvements in those areas and throws other aspects waaaaay back to the sixties and seventies, when the movies weren't afraid to not be taken seriously. The funny-dressing aliens we all remember are back with a vengeance, looking like cosplayers at a Matrix convention.  Hilarious.  Speaking of ""The Matrix"",  Kitamura flaunts it's influence on his filmmaking shamelessly throughout this movie, creating a team of mutant humanoids that could have stepped right out of the film and have all of the over-the-top abilities we saw in that series.  This makes for some very exciting non-kaiju fight scenes; a first in a Godzilla film.  The characters are also among the first truly memorable heroes and villains in G-film history.  After this, I might get into some minor spoilers, so if you want to see the movie without knowing anything about the plot, now's the time to leave. Just trust me, the movie's good.  Check it out.
Now, onto the monsters.  Every major (and most minor) classic era Godzilla foe puts in an appearance (except for Kong, Megalon, and Mechagodzilla).  As a bonus, the infamous American Godzilla even gets a guest-starring spot.  Needless to say, he doesn't last long against the real thing.  Then again, neither do any of the other monsters, aside from the uber-powerful Monster X.  There is also a hilarious dig at long-time Godzilla competitor Gamera in the film that made me laugh out loud, but don't blink or you'll miss it.  Godzilla is largely absent for most of the film after being buried in Antarctica in the first scene.  But once he's unleashed as humanity's last weapon, following a kaiju-powered alien invasion resulting in the destruction of all civilization, he wastes no time leveling every single foe in the film, one after the other.  The fights are short and occasionally riotously cheesy.  There is one shot reminiscent of ""Shaolin Soccer"" that I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw it.  I giggled about that one shot like a schoolgirl for, like, 2 days afterwords.  As I have stated before, Kitamura embraces the cheese in the best possible way.  The lead villain is also a riot.  The guy throws an honest-to-god hissy fit nearly every time his monsters lose, which is always.  It's hilarious to watch. He's also pretty much insane in typical Kitamura villain fashion which just adds to the entertainment value.  However, this film isn't perfect; the pacing is off and many scenes feel like they were slapped together too quickly, a common problem in the budget and deadline-plagued Japanese entertainment industry. The balance between kaiju action and human action becomes hectic to in the second half of the film with so much going on.  Some of the kaiju battles could have been a little cooler, too (Ebirah and Hedorah come to mind).  Also, Mothra looks extremely good in this film but her performance as Godzilla's only non-human ally leaves much to be desired.  Altogether, this is pretty much a no-brainer for old-school Godzilla fans and new-school sci-fi fans alike.  Despite it's flaws, there is just too much damn fine entertainment in this film to pass it by.  This isn't the ultimate Godzilla film (in my opinion, that's GMK); but as a celebration of 50 years of Godzilla stomping Tokyo, kicking ass, and taking names it is a rousing success.",1128729600,94,4229,4.936350777934936

2157334,3,B00061Q6VU,"Director Ryuhei Kitamura's ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" commemorated the 50th anniversary of the franchise with appearances from several past monsters, including Anguirus (1955), Rodan (1956), Mothra (1961), Manda (1963), Ebirah (1966), Kamacuras (1967), Kumonga (1967), Minilla (1967), Hedorah (1971), Gigan (1972), King Caesar (1974), and the 1998 TriStar Godzilla, now dubbed Zilla. This was the sixth and final film in the Millennium period (19992004).
The story begins with the Earth Defense Force (EDF) trapping Godzilla in ice after he battled Gotengo in Antarctica. It then flashes forward to the present, where the EDF and a group of human mutants (like the X-Men) work to combat monsters. When aliens called Xiliens show up (dressed like characters from ""The Matrix""), tensions flare between the EDF and the new arrivals. The EDF soon learns that the Xiliens are not as friendly as they seem and, when exposed, the aliens send the monsters against humanity. The EDF frees Godzilla, who then goes around the world battling the monsters while the EDF fights the Xiliens.
Despite the cool battles, ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" contains much of the worst film elements from the late 1990s and early 2000s. There's overly-fast editing, choppy cuts, disjointed music, and Kitamura attempts to work too many plot points into the film for the audience to follow at times. The expected anti-nuclear proliferation message feels out of place as it doesn't match the scenes that bookend it. At points, ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" feels more like a Sci-Fi Channel movie or a music video from 2004 instead of a major motion picture. That said, fans who disliked TriStar's ""Godzilla"" (1998) will certainly enjoy seeing the Toho Godzilla destroy the CGI monster in the span of 30 seconds. Don Frye's Captain Douglas Gordon is a lot of fun and he plays off the other actors wonderfully with his gravely voice and supportive demeanor. The final battle has more than enough to entertain. Though fun enough to watch for an afternoon, as the final Toho Godzilla film until 2017's ""Shin Godzilla,"" it leaves something to be desired for long-time fans.",1504915200,,2122,5.171511627906977

2157336,4,B00061Q6VU,"Ryuhei Kitamura's contribution to the Godzilla franchise goes over the top in that masterful way he wove his masterpiece Versus--with Kung fu, hysterically flat characters (including a token 'Merican who spouts hypermachismo from his mustachioed face and clearly doesn't understand a word his costars are saying) and ridiculously fun action sequences. Aliens want to harvest mitochondria from earthlings, so of course they resurrect about a dozen giant monsters to ravage the planet (including one of the weakest, a creature that looks like the monster from the embarrassing Broderick flick). Who's to save the day? Big Green, of course. Probably the most fun installment in their 60-year history.",1500422400,,697,5.5233644859813085

2157400,4,B00061Q6VU,"In my opinion, this film is the perfect destruction packed end to the Millennium Series of Godzilla films! While this film does get quite good deal of hate from certain groups of people in the Godzilla community and you certainly shouldn't set your expectations to the moon and back, I feel the majority of Kaiju fans and Godzilla fans, especially if you're a fan of the Showa or the Heisei Kaiju films, you will probably enjoy this film.

Godzilla Final Wars is essentially a remake of both ""Destroy All Monsters"" and ""Invasion of the Astro Monster"" from the Showa Series, with a simple plot of Earth being invaded by Aliens, the Xillens, who take control of Earth's monsters to wipe out civilization and it's up to a reawakened super charged Godzilla( One of the 3 strongest Godzillas only comparable to Meltdown and Shin Godzilla)  and the human crew of the Gotengo to stop them. While this films shares many of the same problems as the aforementioned two films, it has a wide cast of classic Godzilla Kaiju returning for the first time in a decade or decades including Angurius, Rodan, King Caesar, Gigan, Kumonga and about 8 other Kaiju. While the unfortunate drawback of having so many monsters is that some regulated to cameo status and many of the battles with Godzilla besides the ending are rather short to accompany the run time of only 2 hours. While that is unfortunate but usually can't be helped with a monster mash film like this, the film is loaded with references and nods to everything from the original Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla to Atragon and War of the Gargantuas.

The plot is ridiculous and the majority of the characters are overblown stereotypes, but it's really fun and that's what we expect from a Godzilla film that's not Gojira 1954, GMK or Godzilla 1984!  In a change that some people may like and some may dislike, unlike many of the other films, especially in the Heisei Series, the usual military planning and exposition scenes are replaced with many scenes of human characters fighting in Matrix-esque fight scenes and space battles reminiscent of Star Wars and Independence Day. While the homages go clearly overboard at points and it does kill some of the pacing and build-up, I view this as a nice change of pace from the usual Heisei style Godzilla film. The monster battles are really well done, albeit being rather short until the climatic ending, combining both beam weapons and physical close quarters fighting, which suits this Godzilla as the he's been slimmed down to be faster and more agile similar to the Showa Series. Without a doubt, the best part of the film is the final confrontation between Godzilla, Monster X, Gigan and Mothra which is the best and longest battle in the film and really a spectacle to behold. The effects are really good for a Godzilla film, blending both suitmation and CGI pretty seamlessly ,besides a few bad Gigan flying shots, putting the effects of the bad 1998 Zilla Abomination to shame.

This is one of my top 10 favorite Godzilla films and while it certainly has some problems ,that will make really hardcore fans of the series disappointed, it's certainly a hell of a ride in my book!

Additionally, if you hated Godzilla(1998) like myself and many other fans did, you will get some catharsis here when you see what happens when giant French Water Iguana weak enough to be killed by Jet missiles fights the real King of the Monsters. Cheers!",1471910400,,3427,4.770657672849915

It sure isn't the acting as several of the main characters just seemed to mug for the cameras. It could not have been the writing for some of the scenes started out silly and deteriorated to just plain stupid. How did the secretary general fall for that dog ploy on tv? How cliched was Captain Gordon? Did he really stand up to Godzilla with just a samurai sword? I about died laughing at that one. That could have been the dopiest part of the movie had it not been for the corny and hilarious martial arts fight on the motorcycle. That scene was priceless in its stupidity. Then, of course, there is the planet crashing into Earth and how it is deflected. Luckily I have arms on my chair so I did not fall out laughing. Corny as this creation was, there were some great things in it. The main villain, while overacting, was awesome. His fits when a monster got beat were great as were his evil looks and smirks. Godzilla was terrific as usual, but clearly did not get enough screen time. There plenty of monsters but few got much screen time. The final scene with baby Godzilla made me wonder what they were thinking when they filmed that. Silly. As far as Godzilla movies go, Final Wars is not as good as most of the earlier Godzilla films but it is worth a watch. Who knows, despite its many flaws, you might like it enough to buy it.

2157519,2,B00061Q6VU,"This was the last Japanese Godzilla movie made for a long time. They are only recently accepting the idea of making another because of the success of the 2014 American movie. This movie was supposed to be a fun farewell, a swan song, to the Godzilla franchise. It includes almost every Godzilla hero and villain in some way, and has loads of over the top special effects scenes. Unfortunately, those scenes looked cheap and cartoony, and Godzilla goes from being a lumbering lizard in one scene, to a soccer player in the next. It's cheesey to the point of being unfunny and it looks so cheap you cringe. The human story revolves around humanity finding out they are able to access ""powers"" within them that basically made them Dragonball-like characters. I'm glad they'll be rebooting the series soon. After this movie.. I have little faith in Toho.",1427846400,,850,4.789115646258503
2157520,5,B00061Q6VU,"I purchased Godzilla Final Wars HD for my son who loves all things Godzilla but this movie I watched with him and it was pretty good compared to some of the older Godzilla movies.

Lots of action and Ill just say Godzilla has his hands full in this movie.

I bought Amazon Prime to save money on shipping because I order a lot of stuff and the free 2nd day shipping is pretty cool and for around $5.00 I can have most products sent to me in one day which is a price that cannot be matched anywhere on the Internet.

Anyway, when I bought Amazon Prime I got a year of FREE Prime movies which is like NetFlix that was costing me about a $100.00 bucks a year.  I pay $100,00 for Amazon Prime but I get unlimited movies along with free 2 day shipping for a year which is great plus Amazon now delivers 7 days a week. On the new releases and movies that are not on Prime I can just click a button on my TV or device I am watching it on and rent the movie for a really cheap price or buy the movie to keep it in my Prime library which is what I did with Godzilla Final Wars and my son watches it all the time.

I give Godzilla Final Wars and Amazon Prime 5 stars !",1426896000,,1158,3.9106382978723406

2157573,3,B00061Q6VU,"This is a cheesy movie.  Godzilla is only in it at the beginning and again at the end.  The middle and majority of the film focuses on matrix style martial arts action, which isn't bad at all.  There are other giant monsters throughout the film, which is great to see, but the battles with Godzilla are far too short.

A note on the middle portion: The plot is generic.  Aliens come to earth under a banner of peace but are really interested in enslaving the human race by controlling earth's giant monsters.  There is a race of mutant humans who have super human strength, speed, agility, and stamina, and most of the action centers around them.  The dialogue is also pretty cheesy, but this is a Godzilla movie after all, even if the big guy isn't in it very much.  Actually, Godzilla plays an oddly small roll in many of his older films as well (Godzilla vs. the Sea Monser, Godzilla vs. Monster X, Terror of Mechagodzilla...).

For those interested in special features, this one's a dud.  There is some behind the scenes footage, but it's all fragmented images of filming certain fight scenes with Godzilla that contain no dialogue, interviews, or real insights into the filming process.

Overall, this is a fun movie.  Don't take it too seriously; it's all about the over the top action and martial arts.  If you're looking for an abundance of Godzilla, though, look elsewhere.",1412121600,,1382,4.6846473029045645

2157621,1,B00061Q6VU,"My son and I like to watch the older Godzilla movies together, so when I saw this monster melee on instant video I grabbed it.  I have never felt like I absolutely wasted money before.  By that I mean I could've literally burned the money and I would feel better about it than spending it on this movie.  At least if I had bought the dvd I would have something I could sell, but this piece of junk's digital presence is always going to be felt.  So, enough of my bitching about my lost $10.  Here's why the movie is so terrible:
First off, the CG is really bad.  The transition between when the monsters are physical entities to when they are cg creatures is so jarring it's like someone changed the channel.  Everything is also color corrected to give it this gritty look and it's done terribly.  The whole thing is just ugly to look at.
Secondly, the monsters are an after thought in this film.  Manda attacks the sub Atragon and is destroyed in a minute or so, then Godzilla gets frozen in the north pole in another scene that last a minute, then, what feels like days later, all of the monsters show up and each one is shown wreaking havoc for a couple seconds each before the aliens take them away.  After that it is a terrible sci-fi throw-away about a comet that is heading towards earth and the aliens are here to help (but they're really the bad guys who don't blink).  That part of the story goes on FOREVER.  The humans who are mutants get taken over by the aliens (except for one guy), there is a horrible fight on motorcycles, more people not blinking , this guy doesn't remember his dog and then everyone on earth(except like 5 people) is dead.  Then someone remembers it's a Godzilla movie so all the monsters come back after they go break him out of the ice and he one punch knockouts all of them in a half-assed montage.  Then Gigan(who Godzilla killed in the afore mentioned montage) and Ghidorah show up to hand the big G his ass.  Mothra shows up, dies a minute later, Gigan dies again, Ghidorah is too much for Godzilla to handle but one of the five people left alive on the planet has God powers and saves the day.  All of the aliens are dead and some lady and her dog survived.  Godzilla out.  The monsters make an appearance for literally less than fifteen minutes of this two hour assault on my senses, and it's right in the beginning and right at the end.
Never buy this.  If you can see it for free you might do it just to see how bad it is, but never spend money on this in any form.",1401926400,2,2511,4.2706131078224105

I love Godzilla, but this movie was just horrid, Mostly because Godzilla isn't even in it for, at the very least, half the movie. The movie put A LOT of unnecessary focus on some boring cookie-cutter hero characters fighting some even more boring villains. The villains are so boring in this movie that the main villain calls himself X. Can't get more generic than that. Most of the action in this movie comes from these fight scenes between humans that are so badly choreographed and cut that they're nearly unwatchable. There is SOME good monster action in it, but not nearly enough to deserve to be considered a Godzilla movie. And the CGI. Oh god I haven't even gotten to the CGI... so... horrid... Seriously they often use CGI in the movie but it's really horrible CGI. They looked like Playstation 2 graphics at best. This movie would have benefited greatly if it focused on the monsters more instead of the extremely boring human plots, as well as using more practical effects rather than this horrible CGI for everything.",1393891200,,1078,4.708994708994709

I love that the Japanese still opt to keep things old school & further the magic of live action with their creatures & special effects, & not relying so heavily on cgi. It's sadly a dying art. Setting aside the pure fun factor, Toho strives to pull out all the stop's, if unequally here on Godzilla's last adventure with mutant, super soldiers that look like they came right out of groove armada or rhythm nation. And of course a vast array of monsters from Godzilla's rogues gallery, & naturally a chock-full of over the top, bubble gum military warfare. For better or worse, this is basically a comic book or anime brought to cinematic life. Unfortunately, the first 40 minutes or so of the movie concentrates soley on it's human (alien) cast so Godzilla's not given nearly enough screen time as you'd think nor are any of his adversaries. They're just crammed in there for a quick cameo & an even briefer slugfest. There's an obvious influence here from U.S. movies like The Matrix & X-Men yet this movie never seems to take itself too seriously, at least that's how it comes across with the English dubbing. This is science fiction fantasy in all it's flashy & sometimes silly, unapologetic glory.

After years go by the major cities around the world are attacked by monsters, but aliens come to earth and capture all of them because they are friendly space aliens. Turns out not true.

Sinister aliens who take themselves too seriously, Earthling mutants who take themselves too seriously, monsters who take themselves too seriously... this one is for completists only. The kind of movie you watch to try and figure out what they were thinking. It *IS* in Japanese and it's letterboxed, so those are two strong positives. The baby Godzilla makes you want to scream. Not a positive. The mutant/motocross/ninja Earthlings are just baffling -- what is going on? How does this make sense? And the American spaceship pilot is straight out of Central Casting or Central Overacting. W-E-I-R-D. But fun!

I'm trying to get through this movie again all in one sitting and it's just baffling. What were they thinking?  There are too many things thrown into the mix, and, worse, they're all magpied bits of other movies, the big alien ship from ""Independence Day"", long trenchcoats from ""The Matrix"", endless kung fu fighting, an insipid evil villain, an ""Alien""-looking robot monster... Is this a Godzilla movie? Was there an accident or mix-up at the DVD plant? It's like five or six bad movies all overlaid on top of one another. I just can't keep track of any supposed plot in all of this. It sure isn't like any other Godzilla movie, and I own all of them on DVD, ideally in Japanese. This thing is just rudderless. When you're watching a movie and wondering if it shouldn't be over already, that's not a good sign. Or maybe I'm hoping that this will somehow make sense at some point. Oh, isn't that the spaceship from ""Atragon""? What's it doing here? And, my goodness, there's Godzilla! Fighting a robot form of Gigan? Or is it the penguin-nosed monster from ""The Mysterians""? It's worse than trying to untangle Christmas lights. Now there's a robot version of Ghidorah. Godzilla has kind of a scrunched-looking beak in this movie.

2157690,5,B00061Q6VU,"Let's just get this out of the way right now. As a film, Godzilla: Final Wars is very flawed. However, this is not a film that was meant to be the Citizen Cane of giant monster films, as the original Gojira is. The year was 2004, and it was Godzilla's 50th anniversary. It was for that reason that Toho made a grand decision, deciding to go all-out and produce a film devoted to pure fan service. It's an anniversary special, and a great one. This is a film which brings the kaiju action to a previously unexplored level. Sure, some of it can get a little silly (at one point Godzilla uses Anguirus as a soccer ball), but that's all part of the fun. Anyone who's familiar with the director, Ryuhei Kitamura, and has seen his 2000 opus Versus can see the DNA of that film amplified here, and with Giant monsters (who make everything better). Furthermore, this is the Kill Bill of Godzilla films. Godzilla kicks so much ass in this film, culminating in the final battle with an old rival. However, the best part of the film is definitely the scene in Sydney, Australia where Godzilla faces off against the horrendous 1998 version of Godzilla (of which Toho was so ashamed they have officially re-named him ""zilla""). The fight is certainly the shortest of the movie, as it well should be. Godzilla easily dispatches his iguana counterpart, and all of us G fans who were outraged in 1998 had our thirst for vengeance quenched and quenched good.

In short, don't buy this movie if you're looking for Oscar material. Because it isn't. But it wasn't supposed to be, all it's supposed to do is be a fun, action packed tribute to Godzilla and it does it beautifully. If what you want is a darker, more thematic end to the franchise, they already did that on the 40th anniversary in 1994 with Godzilla vs Destroyah, which at the time was gonna be the end of the series. With Final Wars, what we get is one hell of a montage to the genre I love.",1354924800,2,1934,4.447887323943662
2157691,1,B00061Q6VU,"After re-watching all the Toho monster films from 1954's Godzilla through all the 1970's films (all with Japanese soundtrack and English sub-titles...won't watch it any other way), I decided to pick up what I could of the later Godzilla 1985 to present film DVD's.
I loved Godzilla Giant Monsters All Out Attack, and really enjoyed Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla. Even Godzilla Tokyo S.O.S. was fun. Then I tried Godzilla The Final War. I wish I hadn't...
When I saw so many American names in the openning credits, I was concerned. I wasn't thinking 1998's Godzilla so much, but still concerned.
When other reviewers compared portions of the film to a Matrix wanna-be, they were right. Obnoxious over-the-top young humans in wild over-the-top action scenes with blaring rock and roll music was too much for me. Not enough monster time, too much time with unappealing humans. And the American actor who played the captain of the ship was unbelievably bad.
Hey, it's just supposed to be a fun giant monster movie, not about post-teen angst (these fighters looked maybe just out of high school).
It's a cheap buy, so as a Godzilla fan check it out and see for yourself...but be warned.",1345939200,3,1178,4.895
2157692,4,B00061Q6VU,"I do not regret buying this movie. The first three times I watched it, I was thrilled. But if you don't watch eca-Kaiju movies for the Monster battles and the like, then this movie will be a bummer for you. The main human character, Ozaki,  is basically a 'Gary-stu' having no real background, weakness, or anything like that. In fact, all of the characters have that problem, even the invaders. This made the human-side of the movie un-enjoyable besides Douglas Gordon, played by Don Frye.

Nevertheless, even the battles leave something more to be desired. Once Godzilla's let loose again, he takes out Gigan, Zilla, Kamackrus, Kumonga, King Seezar, Rodan, and Anguirus in about 7 minutes. Then he takes out Hedorah and Elibrah in another 30 seconds, and then has to struggle through the rest of the movie to overcome Monster X/Keizer Ghidorah. With all of these short battles, it almost leaves you feeling like your playing a 1990's video game where the first XX number of levels are easy, then you go through a medium-difficulty level, and suddenly your hit with a real long battle.

The movie itself I'd only give a 3.5/5. However, I'm upping the rating to 4 because I have to compliment how fast the order got to my place. I think it was like four days. It was in great condition, and I still would not revoke this order for anything...unless I could get the last two 1990's Gamera Trilogy movies for the same price.",1335657600,2,1422,4.68

When Godzilla puts the throw down on Zilla, I never liked that imposter. This is a great film for new Godzilla fans too. I suspect though that the final wars won't be so final.",1335139200,,468,4.211111111111111
2157694,1,B00061Q6VU,"Before I watched this movie, ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" topped the list of stinkers featuring the Big-G. But ""Megalon"" came out at a time when the Japanese film industry was in an economic freefall and budgets were slashed severely, leading to mediocre movies that failed to reach its potential due to the cost and little studio support, so at least that had an excuse. This, on the other hand, was built as the ultimate Godzilla movie, the end-all, be-all of Toho monster movies, the magnum opus of a lucrative movie franchise, and the modern equivalent of ""Destroy All Monsters"". Most of all, it marked the 50th birthday of Japan`s most popular icon. When I saw it with my father a couple of days ago, to say that it was a disappointing experience were an understatement. If anything, ""Final Wars"" reinforces the inaccurate notion that Godzilla was not a legitimate monster franchise but a representative of campy, incompetent film-making.

Everything about the movie was pitiful: the acting, writing, special effects and even the monster fights, in which some did not even last a minute. But the main reason it is my pick as the worst Godzilla movie of all time is because it did not feel like a Godzilla movie. It felt like a piss-poor hybrid of ""Star Wars"", ""The Matrix"", ""Independence Day"", ""Dragonball Z"" and ""Star Trek"". It was like the worst sort of fan fiction, depleting the spirit of the original series by making fun of it. The humans were dull, bland, one-dimensional and a waste of time (literally, since the final human battle lasted longer than the entire movie's monster fights combined) and Godzilla didn't even appear to whoop ass until the one hour mark. Throughout the movie, there were more human fights than monster fights and many of them would JUST. NEVER. END. Was this a Godzilla movie we were watching or a Japanese comedian's attempt to put Neo in Planet X?

Even the choice of monsters was a real head-scratcher. I mean, come on, King Caesar? Hedorah? Ebriah? Kamacuras? Why not Varan? Baragon? Gaira? Manda? Gorosaurus? Titanosaurus? They even showed a montage of stock footage featuring most of these monsters and they were not even used. What the hell? Minya, Godzilla's son, appeared and contributed nothing. Even in ""Destroy All Monsters"", he had a minor but significant role. And in one ridiculous scene, Anguirus rolls into a ball and King Caesar and Godzilla uses him like a soccer ball. Is this a Godzilla movie or a slapstick comedy?

There are a lot of people who will defend this movie and state that its lightheartedness is beside the point. And it's frustrating because most of these people seem to be confusing fun with terrible writing (the same theory also applies with ""Megalon"" and ""Gigan""). The main appeal in the best Godzilla movies (""Godzilla"", ""Mothra vs. Godzilla"", ""Ghidorah"", ""Monster Zero"" and ""Destroy All Monsters""), as well as many of the Toho sci-fi movies of the '50's and 60's, is that while they were light-hearted and fun, the excellent screenwriting, generally good acting and exciting monster fights transcended the movie`s flaws and made them enjoyable to watch, even if the special effects have not aged well. When one watches ""Final Wars"" ten years from now, are they still going to appreciate the movie because of its ""light-heartedness""? Do they think a Godzilla movie where Anguirus is used to score a goal is going to be worth anything special in the long run?

Say what you want about ""Revenge"" (which is often billed as the worst Godzilla movie of all time) but it was marketed as a children's film and fulfilled those expectations. Everybody knew that the movie was not geared to adults the same way the filmmakers were aware that no one over the age of 8 was going to enjoy it. It also helped that it was 69 minutes, which is nearly half of ""Final Wars""' time length. On the other hand, I expected ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" to be a modern ""Destroy All Monsters"" (which this movie was hyped as) and that it would be the most exciting Godzilla movie of all time and all I got was a third-rate ""Star Wars"" clone with terrible actors fighting each other in shoddy ""Matrix""-style fighting. When my father, who loves Godzilla, hates this movie and thinks it`s worse than ""Catwoman"", there's a problem. You couldn't have asked for a more rotten 50th birthday cake than this stinker.

Strongest recommendation to avoid at all costs.",1333929600,4,4397,4.8339973439575035
2157695,3,B00061Q6VU,"""Godzilla: Final Wars"" is a major letdown. For Godzilla fans, there's not enough kaiju action and when there is, it's not on-screen for very long.

Surprisingly, Godzilla appears and quickly\easily, takes-out monster after monster, within seconds to under 2 minutes. It's a shame, because more time couldve been spent on monster battles and less on the human story, which is really boring and silly.

In fact, you see Godzilla for a little bit in the opening scenes and then he shows up, towards the end, to plow through many famous Godzilla monsters with ease. Monsters like: Angurius, Rodan, King Ceasar, Gigan, Hedorah and even GINO (American ""Godzilla"").

This film is basically, a remake of Destroy All Monsters, but with a stylized, futuristic anime\""Matrix""-inspired look for the human story. There's not much to say about that story...many of the scenes are done with different shades of color, with lots of camera angles, quick cuts and a very cliched script that includes, laughable drama and dialogue.

In other words, the human story is terribly written and directed. It does not feel like it belongs in a Godzilla movie and I guess that was the intention...there are no reporters, archeologists or even a normal military.

 Instead, the film revolves around genetically engineered humans, who are not afraid to fight anything. When watching the human scenes, you sometimes swear it was a totally different film, than a Godzilla one. I must say though that it's cool to see a lot veteran actors, from past Godzilla films, as well as the ex-American wrestler, Don Frye,who plays ""Captain Gordon"".

As for the invading Xillian aliens, they mostly, walk and talk in human form and all look like rejects of the Matrix. When the actual alien creatures do appear on-screen, its just dead bodies of a couple (which are poorly made).

The musical score is also terrible. The music sounds nothing like previous Godzilla scores, except for clips of a remixed anthem of the original Gojira theme in the opening credits and a few seconds of a score from the first, Godzilla vs MechaGodzilla.

The scenes of monsters attacking different cities, throughout the world, are fun to watch; especially, Rodan's attack on New York. It is awesome to see Angurius, Rodan and King Ceasar again and most excitingly, seeing them have a big brawl, against Godzilla.

Speaking of Godzilla, his head\face looks like a rat, which is disappointing, since the rest of the suit looks slim and sleek. And the design of the new kaiju, ""Monster X"" and ""Keiser Ghidorah"" looks just plain silly and cheap. Rodan, Angurius, Gigan, King Ceasar, Mothra, and the other monsters are updated nicely, even though there is a lot of CG enhancement in places. The Gigan design, in both of it's phases, is fantastic.

The editing of the film jumbles the narrative all over the place. Many times, monster battles are interrupted with more of the boring human story, which includes a ridiculous sub-plot about Minilla (Godzilla's son) befriending a boy and his grandpa and riding around in a truck.

So, while it sounds like I hated the film, I didnt, because seeing the monsters on screen, was enough to make me forgive the faults of the rest of the film. All of the monster scenes, while mostly brief, were still fun to watch.

This is and isn't the film Toho should have made to start this Godzilla ""break"". While its interesting to see a Godzilla film to have this anime-kind of inspiration in it's human presentation, it just doesn't feel like a traditional, Godzilla production. A lot of bad CGI is used throughout the film, severly taking away anykind of realistic approach. Apparently, having scenes being filmed around the world took much of the budget... meaning less monster scenes and battles and instead, more focus on the humans.

So the question is, should Toho return to the Godzilla franchise, will future films look\be more like ""Final Wars"" or will Godzilla films continue the traditional presentation, that we all are used to?

2157697,2,B00061Q6VU,"Alright look, if you have ever seen a ryuhei kitamura movie, you know what to expect: exactly the same thing as every other ryuhei kitamura movie. The whole movie is shot in blue or orange, like there was a silk screen over the lense, and there is alot of matrix style fist fights, girls in impractically short skirts for the situations they are in (I mean, I like nice legs as much as the next guy, but your really wearing a leather micro-mini to a laser gun fight with aliens?), and guys that look like an asian Motley Crue tribute band. Kitamura basically disregarded everything that makes us fans love Godzilla movies in an almost pathetically laughable attempt to make a ""hip, cool, modern, relevent sci-fi movie"" and it results in an absolute train wreck of a film. The only truly good parts of this movie are that pretty much every monster in the Godzilla universe is in it, and Don Frye's Captain Gordon is actually pretty awesome. Beyond that, there is way to much focus on ""character developement"", which might actually be a good thing if done well, but it still doesn't mean that the star of the show isn't 100 metres tall and charcoal grey. Not to mention the attempts at character development are laughable aweful. Perhaps the worst sin of all is that the monster battles are all horribly abreviated, most coming in at just under 2 minutes. Don't get me wrong, parts of this movie are actually incredibly fun, and the effects are rather well done, but over all you walk away feeling like some kind of injustice has been done to your childhood hero. Seriously, the expectations for a Godzilla movie are both rather low and easily achievable, and this film fails to meet almost all of them.",1328745600,,1701,4.617161716171617

An organization called the Earth Defense Force (EDF) is created to protect the planet. They freeze Godzilla, but must soon deal with an alien invasion. The aliens control Anguirus, Rodan, King Caesar, Kamacuras, Monster X and many more. Earth's final chance of survival is Godzilla. If you love monsters and mind-numbing action, you'll love GODZILLA: FINAL WARS!!!",1328140800,2,570,5.415730337078652
2157699,5,B00061Q6VU,"GODZILLA FINAL WARS may not please Godzilla purists but it delivers the goods for everybody else--at least those with some knowledge of Godzilla lore. I saw it with a packed house of G fans at Subway Cinema's annual New York Asian Film Festival and it was the perfect audience for a film as steeped in the kaiju mythos as this one. Every time a new monster appeared on screen the crowd applauded or, rather, they applauded once that monster became recognizable, since the director often teases us with quick cuts and blurry motion before giving us a good, steady full-body shot. There are 15 monsters in all, many friendly old faces and some obscure ones, but all recognizable to longtime Godzilla fans.

The other real pleasure for G fans is the star-studded cast. Three venerable stars of older kaiju films turn up, two in major roles. Akira Takarada (star of the original GODZILLA, 1954) plays the UN Secretary General and Kumi Mizuno (the gorgeous leading lady from MONSTER ZERO, FRANKENSTEIN CONQUERS THE WORLD, WAR OF THE GARGANTUAS and more) plays the Commander of the Earth Defense Force. In a smaller role, Kenji Sahara turns up in a lab coat assisting the attractive young female biologist (Rei Kikukawa) assigned to investigate the monster attacks. Also on hand are Jun Kunimura (Boss Tanaka in KILL BILL VOL. 1); Kane Kosugi, a martial arts star in his own right and son of ""ninja"" star Sho Kosugi; and one other gorgeous actress, Maki Mizuno, who plays the biologist's newscaster sister. Masahiro Matsuoka plays Ozaki, the lead mutant hero who uses MATRIX-style martial arts to fight the alien invaders. Don Frye (Public Enemies) plays the tough American captain who pilots the Gotengo (the flying, burrowing ship from ATRAGON) and stands up to the aliens in several memorable confrontations. A martial artist/wrestler/extreme fighter known primarily in Japan, Frye speaks all his lines in English in the Japanese print I saw, while everyone else speaks Japanese to him.

The film's all-star monster cast and alien invasion plot seem derived chiefly from DESTROY ALL MONSTERS (1968), but with everything pumped up to hyper speed. The film is incredibly fast-paced and filled with action, either in the form of battles between monsters or martial arts fights/ray-gun shootouts between the human and mutant defenders and the alien invaders. Since the monsters attack numerous cities around the world (including New York, Paris, Shanghai, Tokyo--of course--and even Vancouver!) there turns out to be more mass destruction in this film than in all other G films combined.

One can argue that the whole production is sheer lunacy, but it's lunacy done with conviction and affection. The director clearly knows and loves Godzilla films and he conveys that love while also adding new twists and imaginative touches (e.g. Anguirus, the spike-covered ankylosaurus, curling up into a spiked ball to launch a rolling attack). One's overall reaction depends on any number of factors, but this should definitely be seen by all kaiju fans.

This film packs punch!  It has lots of great combat scenes - not only between the humans and the aliens, but certainly amongst the monsters as Godzila fights his way across the globe and up the ranks as wave after of giant monsters try to bar his path.

I give this one Two GIANT thumbs up!",1319846400,13,3330,5.001805054151625

2157701,3,B00061Q6VU,"This could have been a great movie for me if it was scripted different. All the monsters were cool. However, too much time was given to the scenes with people and not enough to the monsters. If there was about fifteen minutes less people time and instead fifteen minutes added to the monster scenes it would have been cooler. Also I would have liked to see the monsters put up more of a fight.  Godzilla tears through them like Oprah at a buffet. A cooler ending would have been Rodan, Caesar and Anguirus coming to godzilla and Mothra's aid against Gigan and Ghidorah  in a all out donnybrook.  I still enjoyed the movie in general.

2157702,5,B00061Q6VU,"A lot of the other reviewers here are complaining about a lot of things in Godzilla: Final Wars, such as its use of ""Matrix""-like effects. I haven't seen any of the ""Matrix"" films, so it makes zero difference to me. I don't watch Godzilla movies for anything that causes the hearts of film afficionados to flutter, anyway. What I wanted, and what I got, was a non-stop action movie featuring not only our favorite big green dinosaur, but all of his previous foes, as well. Others have gone into the plot at some length, so I won't repeat it here. Suffice to say that in spite of all the ""holes"" others have noticed, this is one action-packed, (literally) roaring good time! Godzilla gets to kick butt and take names all over the world this time. The lead alien is hilarious, and his temper trantrums are a hoot to watch.

One tip for watching the English-language version--watch it with the English subtitles on. There are some differences between the subtitled text and the spoken words that just had me rolling on the floor! My favorite: The subtitles read, ""There is a strong creature on earth."" The lead alien is saying, ""That Godzilla is one tough dude!"" How can you NOT laugh at that?

One other small note: Godzilla has an absolutely gorgeous ""WTF?!?!"" moment during his battle with Ghidorah at the end. I won't say more, as I don't want to spoil it, but it's worth the price of the whole movie (to me, anyway)!",1313452800,,1418,4.578740157480315
2157703,2,B00061Q6VU,"Now let me see if I have this straight: a group of reptilian (or insect-like) aliens wearing human skin gain telepathic control of Earth's most fearsome monsters, so MMA legend Don Frye and his team of mutant (are they mutants?) karate masters and mistresses must fly to the South Pole in a big submersible drill bit and summon Godzilla to save the world.

I think I should have watched this film in the original Japanese without subtitles; my imagination, while watching, might have supplied a script that made more sense.

That said, this movie is fun to watch. It's committed to the world it creates and pays homage to the Godzilla genre by bringing in stars of previous Godzilla films along with every other monster the big G ever fought. It plays off of the ""V"" series of the 1980s, the Matrix, and several other sci-fi films -- even the ""Gotengo"" (that magic underground, undersea, through the air drill bit that's been in other Japanese Kaiju films) has the same lines as the Nautilus from the original ""20,000 Leagues Beneath the Sea."" And I have to admit that I was sucked in -- in part by the bewildering plot, in part by the cast of monsters and aliens, in part by the bizarre presence of Don Frey (Raymond Burr, I guess, is permanently unavailable), and in part by the perverse attraction I have to train wrecks.

Objectively I can't give this more than two stars (maybe two and a half) for many reasons, and some are due to the limitations of the genre. But it suffers even in comparison to its predecessors, and it's not just the plot and script. Some of the scenes involving exposition drag on too long, the pacing is uneven, there's plenty of (also very committed) overacting, and there are too many continuity problems: every 10 minutes or so, I was asking, ""wait ... wasn't he ... weren't they ...?""  And there's too much Matrix-style kung fu and not enough of monsters slugging it out for global domination (which is why we really watch these films).

I still enjoy the original 1954 film as it has an edge to it that has been blunted here (as in other Kaiju films of the 90s) by too many fantasy elements.

But hey: if you like a lot of cheese on your popcorn, check it out.  It's a fun night in.",1311292800,2,2216,4.497512437810945

While not completely dumb, one watching the movie gets the idea that it drags on and on.

2157708,4,B00061Q6VU,"Anybody that watches this film or reads reviews of this movie can see why it doesn't work. It has only the thinnest sense of continuity, it creates a world that barely makes any sense, it trips over itself trying to explain its crazy mayhem. It does what Godzilla movies do, except more so, because 21st century filmmaking places an emphasis on exposition and worldbuilding that 60s and 70s filmmaking didn't. If you are obsessed with wellconstructed plots and characters that are sympathetic with firm motivations, you will lose out on the magic of Final Wars. Final Wars is the culmination of 50 amazing years of madness, 50 years of mutable reality where giant monsters ravage and save the Earth and aliens in tinfoil jumpsuits plot against us. The intro to Final Wars takes you back through Godzilla's journey from destroyer to messiah to antihero and back and reminds you of a pop culture legacy as rich as any. The rest of the film does its best to maintain that, but as I said, gets bogged down with exposition and 21st century storytelling. But this has giant monster fights, wacky aliens, the Mothra twins and all the things we come to expect from Godzilla amped up to a level never before seen in the series, and that's what really matters.",1296345600,,1250,4.712328767123288

Since the special features and commentary are effectively useless to a mono-lingual individual, my favourite feature was on disc 1, in which there's a menu that lets you select a monster. It then plays every bit of screen time that monster got - a beautiful feature for we who have seen the flick a million times and just want to see Goji trash all the other monsters.

2157714,4,B00061Q6VU,"This movie is a loose re-make of Destroy All Monsters, which just happened to be my favorite Godzilla movie while growing up.  From what I understand, this movie starts off where the last movie ended, with Godzilla buried under the ice in Antarctica.  The classic repertoire of Toho monsters appears, and they start to destroy the world.  Then some aliens appear, extinguish the monsters and call for earth to join the united universe or something - behind a ruse that a planet is on a collision course with earth. A group of earthlings expose the plot of the aliens, and the aliens unleash all the monsters, which are under their control, as well as a group of ""mutant"" humans because they all share a common gene.

The humans respond by waking up Godzilla, who then proceeds to tackle on his rival monsters one on one, or one on two, until they are all destroyed.  The humans do their part and destroy the aliens.  Godzilla turns on the humans in order to finish the last fight, but Minya, or Minilla (current name), steps in and convinces Godzilla to leave the humans alone.

Do we watch monster movies for the human actions?  Generally, no, but this one has some pretty good fight scenes.  You can see the influence of the Matrix films, and a little bit of Tarentinoesque action in this film.  Score one for that.  Don Frye knows how to use a samurai sword - bonus points for that.

Now onto the important aspects of the film:  the kaiju fight scenes.  Overall, I am disappointed on many fronts. 1. That it was Godzilla and Mothra against all.  If it wasn't going to be Ghidorah vs all like Destroy All Monsters, it should have been earth monsters versus space monsters. But this is a minor nit.  2. Many of the monster fights were too short, including the non-fight with Hedorah and Ebirah because these two took each other out before the fight with Godzilla began. But then again, Godzilla vs the Smog Monster started a rapid decline in the enjoyment of this franchise and should Hedorah even have been included in this?  3. Mothra was her noble self, but for taking on Gigan 12,000 years ago, she should have been a little bit more help to Godzilla. 4. Ghidorah is a much stronger opponent and especially that fight should have lasted longer. 5. I think Minya should have put the finishing touches on Ghidorah - that would have been icing on the cake.  Disappointments aside, this Bruce Lee, Enter the Dragon type, one after the other type of fighting done by Godzilla was really enjoyable to watch, and a nice tribute to the essence of the Godzilla franchise.

On fight scene I did like though, and, it must be an inside joke because Angurus is strong against humans, but he is always the weakest monster, and I think it is a fight with Gigan that Angurus is treated like a soccer ball between the other two monsters.

When the movie was over and done with, I was very satisfied at the end.",1274486400,3,2898,4.536538461538462

2157719,5,B00061Q6VU,"The latest entry into the long standing Toho Godzilla series, ""Final Wars"" packs so much into the two hour film, fans of the giant lizard are bound to find something in here to love.

The film opens with Godzilla being buried in ice by the latest group of human assigned to stop these rampaging monster, the EDF (Earth Defense Force). Only this time, these guys may have the edge because they aren't simple human beings, they are mutants. Not sure how this gives them an edge against towering monster...but it does provide for some awesome kung-fu fight scenes sprinkled throughout the film. When an entire slew of monsters begins attacking major cities around the world, it seems even the EDF might have too much to handle...and that is when the aliens show up. Are the aliens here to help....what has caused the monsters to suddenly begin attacking at once?

This movie is a lot of fun! If you love Toho's kaiju films, you MUST see this film. Almost all of Godzilla's former foes make an appearance, from Manda to Ghidorah and even Hedorah (The Smog Monster) makes a brief cameo.

Sure, the storyline is kind of a re-hash or mish-mash of earlier films (specifically ""Invasion of Astro Monster"" aka ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero""), but that is part of the fun. If you are looking for a deep storyline, with a heavy plot and character development look elsewhere. The storyline serves it's purpose in putting almost all of Toho's giant monsters in play. And they look great! Enhanced with some CGI, but still clearly Toho's ""Suitmation"" special effects. The budget was much bigger for this film and it shows. The scenery looks great, the action non-stop and the special effects are great. There is some decent character development, and the actors do a great job in not getting completely overshadowed by the mutant beasties.

If you haven't seen the newer Godzilla films, give this one a shot. There is a good reason this film series has now stretched over 5 decades.",1263772800,,1964,4.767647058823529
2157720,2,B00061Q6VU,"Calling Godzilla: Final Wars a disaster is a bit of an understatement.  With a $20 million budget, GFW was Toho's most expensive ""Godzilla"" film to date, and it shows.  Visually, GFW is easily the most impressive film of the Millennium Series (which isn't saying much).  But is it really a Godzilla film?  Out of this 125-minute sci-fi epic, Godzilla gets a whopping...13 minutes of screen time!  This is absolutely inexcusable, especially for the big guy's 50th Anniversary grand finale.

Perhaps the problem was with director Ryuhei Kitamura, who was obviously more interested in copying The Matrix, X-Men, Independence Day, and various other Hollywood movies than making a kaiju film.  While the monster scenes we do get are fun and visually spectacular, they're incredibly brief.  The worldwide destruction scenes last maybe 10 seconds each, and are usually followed by kung fu sequences or dialogue scenes that drag on for far too long (and are far too campy).

In defense of Kitamura, he was easily the most talented director of the Millennium Saga.  Unlike Tezuka and Kaneko, who have no real artistic sensibilities, Kitamura crafts GFW with arty camera angles, color filters, quick editing, and flashy music video-style visuals.  Unfortunately, this isn't enough to hide GFW's unoriginality, its awful, scene-ruining performance by Don Frye (whoever allowed him to star in the film should have their head examined), and all-too-brief kaiju sequences.

GFW bombed at the box office, pulling in the worst numbers since the 70s (barely a million tickets sold, resulting in about $10 million in revenue).  Its failure was deserved, because it's a lousy film.  While its visual flair and (sometimes) clever nods to previous Godzilla and Toho films lift it up above the rest of the Millennium films, GFW is one giant mistake in the end.  After being Toho's top draw for five deacdes, Godzilla deserved better than this.",1261872000,3,1921,5.171521035598706
2157721,4,B00061Q6VU,"I really do not know how to rate this movie. At first I really did not care for the movie but recently it has begun to grow on me and it has become a guilty pleasure to enjoy. Therefore, I can see both sides of the issue of whether this was either a spectacular and extravagant way to end the Godzilla series or was it a catastrophic dud and cinematic train wreck?

This is basically a remake of the late 60s Godzilla classic ""Destroy All Monsters"" with hyped up special effects and nods to such modern day popular movies as The Matrix and X-Men. This movie has the flavor of the late 60s Godzilla movies which tended to be campy and way over the top while still being enjoyable. This tone marks a departure from the manner in which more recent Godzilla movies were made which tended to have the level of camp toned down to at least a digestible level.

This movie does play like a Saturday morning episode of Power Rangers hyped up on cough syrup with Godzilla and all of his friends thrown into the mix along with Law of Physics defying Ninja mutants and Matrix style aliens all vying to destroy the world and each other. So if that sounds like an enjoyable way to spend 2 hours then you may like this movie. If that doesn't sound like fun, then I suggest staying away.

Yes, this movie is silly, over the top with pretty good special effects, bad acting and cheesy corny dialog with an implausible story and many monsters fighting and trying to out maneuver one another with professional wrestling tactics which would make Hulk Hogan proud. As I said this movie has grown on me and falls under the category that it is ""so bad it is good."" This movie appeals to my inner nerdiness and I can accept it for what it is: a 50th Anniversary all-star campy Godzilla extravaganza.",1257552000,,1775,4.405487804878049
2157722,5,B00061Q6VU,"This is one of the best Godzilla movies of all-time, in my opinion. It's got everything you could hope for in a Godzilla flick including a surprise visit from GINO (Godzilla In Name Only), which is the American version of Godzilla. It also has Kung-Fu Fighting aliens, Super-Powered Mutant Humans, Star Wars inspired space battles, Giant Monsters galore, and even a cute little baby Godzilla to tickle your funny bone and round things out. Any movie that packs all of that into one package is okay in my book. This movie is just one big zany, fun-filled, action-packed giant monster slug-fest that is perfect for a Saturday Night monster movie marathon!",1257206400,3,653,4.891891891891892

First - and I hate to say this because I love a good monster mash as much as the next monster geek - there are way too many monsters in this film.  With so many creatures battling for screen time, things get cluttered very quickly.  It reminded me of the ""monster rally"" films that Universal made at the end of their monster series.  While I loved seeing Hedorah for the 3.1 seconds that he was onscreen, I have to question whether he even needed to be there in the first place (Yes, I know that I am in the minority for my love of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-Vs-Hedorah/dp/B0002V7OEM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla Vs Hedorah</a>&nbsp;but that's another story!).  I also have to question why Ebirah (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-vs-the-Sea-Monster/dp/B00006IUGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster</a>) gets a big scene when he was never a big player in the Godzilla universe.  Also, Kitamura works hard to ""update"" the Godzilla formula by adding slick Hollywood-style visuals and employing MTV-ish editing that just doesn't work.  While the Godzilla films have taken elements from American films in the past (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-vs-King-Ghidorah-Godzilla-Mothra-The-Battle-for-Earth/dp/0767825489/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah / Godzilla & Mothra: The Battle for Earth</a>), they seem a bit more prevalent here and, as such, are all the more irritating.  The story also lifts elements from numerous Japanese sci-fi films of the past (Gorath,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Destroy-All-Monsters/dp/B00003IXDZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Destroy All Monsters</a>&nbsp;&<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invasion-of-Astro-Monster-aka-Monster-Zero/dp/B000OCY7IK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invasion of Astro-Monster (aka Monster Zero)</a>to name a few) but adds virtually nothing new to the mix.  The music is also sub-par.  I am a big fan of Keith Emerson's soundtrack work (see&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Inferno/dp/B000ERU6J4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Inferno</a>) but his style does not mesh with the kaiju eiga (monster film) genre at all.  I am not familiar with the other composers but the same goes for their contributions to this soundtrack.  The Sum 41 song that plays over the battle with the American G & the Japanese one seems out of place as well.  The acting & dialogue are nothing to write home about (the whole Matrix-y ""chosen one"" thing is wearing a bit thin).  This includes Akira Takarada (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gojira-Godzilla-Deluxe-Collector-s-Edition-Gojira-Godzilla-1954-Godzilla-King-of-the-Monsters-1956/dp/B000FA4TLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gojira / Godzilla Deluxe Collector's Edition (Gojira/Godzilla [1954] / Godzilla, King of the Monsters [1956])</a>) and Kumi Mizuno (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein-Conquers-the-World-Frankenstein-Vs-Baragon/dp/B000JU8H7E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein Conquers the World / Frankenstein Vs. Baragon</a>).  On the plus side, Godzilla looks good as does Monster X.  The new Ghidorah at the end of the film is decent but not as impressive as his past incarnations.  Some of the all-too-brief battle scenes are staged well but having Godzilla beat the enemy monsters in a matter of minutes gets tiresome after a while.  All in all, this is a wasted opportunity & a sad goodbye for an old friend.

Personally, I would have liked to see the movie take itself a little bit more seriously, but really, the only serious godzilla movie I've seen in the first. It is true there could have been more monster fighting, but I think part of the problem if the movie length. If we had the same amount of monster fighting in a 90 minute movie I don't think there would so much complaining, but this film is 2 hours. Another issue is that the movie rips off the Matrix and Star Wars, and is full of cliche...(if they took that out and made it more dramatic). Don Frye is as badass as as anyone could be, otherwise the other characters didn't interest me too much...they were too cliche.

2157725,5,B00061Q6VU,"Let me start by saying this:  Final Wars is the first Godzilla movie I've watched in about 10 years.  Besides 2000, I have not seen anything past 1985.  However, after watching this film, I think I will try to catch up.

[...] - some of you may already know him as the angry video game nerd (check this guy out).  Anyway, he has a comprehesive review list on that website of what I believe are most if not all of the Godzilla flicks.  Watching that, I felt my interest rekindled, and it just so happened that Final Wars was the only one in the whole series being sold at the local video store.  I got it, watched it, and I got to say that I have not have that much fun watching an action flick in YEARS!

This movie just kicks ass the whole way through.  I was entertained non-stop.  Many of the reviews here hate the fact that Godzilla is not on screen for much of the film, but when he is on, it is simply killer.  By the way, how can one measure a movie by how long the title character is on screen?  By that logic, Alien, Predator, and Jaws must all suck because the title entity is hardly ever there.

Now, I'm not oblivious - I know I've just refered to three classics.  But classic or not, these movies are in my collection because I loved watching them.  And that's why I give Final Wars 5 stars.  Make no mistake about it; by it's very nature, this is a bad movie.  But that is what Godzilla flicks are - bad movies that we love to watch (except for the American Godzilla, because that one was just plain BAD!)  This movie gets a five score because I absolutly had a blast viewing it.  This was probably the most fun I had watching an action flick since Die Hard with a Vengeance.

Bold?  Sure, but honest.  I will not bother with a plot synopsis.  Suffice it to say that if you have a love for fun movies, this will satisfy yoiur craving and then some.

After 2 viewings it occurred to me that Don Frye's character of Capt. Gordon is the human incarnation of the Big ""G"": a foreign monster who just won't stop. Fortunately for the Japanese, this monster is on their side. In one scene, Gordon looks at the oncoming monster and states that: ""He just won't stop."" There is a very understated admiration and recognition of a kindred soul in that statement. I also got a big grin out of the surviviors' discussion around the table as to what they need to do to win the war. Gordon minces no words and everyone just has to swallow a very big pill if they want to defeat the aliens. Don Frye has a wonderful supporting role in the new Dillinger movie.

The plot is simple, Aliens, who claim to be friendly at first, come down to earth only to wreak havok by briging back all the world's monsters to destroy mankind. A special breed of ""super humans"" with great powers are sent to fight them off. When they can't do it alone, they have no choice but to awaken the sleeping Godzilla to help defend earth. Plenty of fast action, in fact the first 15 minutes of this film's sets the stage for what is to come. If you are a godzilla fan, I'm sure you will find your fav monster here. One great scene has the Amercian version of Godzilla appear, and our Japanese counterpart nails him with one quick blow of the tail (are the Japanese trying to tell us something?).

2157742,2,B00061Q6VU,"Godzilla: Final Wars features the green giant going up against all his former enemies - though to get to that point, one has to sit through an interminable opening hour that couldn't possibly be more dull. When the various monsters from Godzilla's past (including Rodan, Gigan, and even Roland Emmerich's Godzilla) begin simultaneously wreaking havoc, all seems hopeless - until a group of seemingly friendly aliens effortlessly take care of the problem moments after arriving on the scene. As it turns out, the aliens are - in fact - even more dangerous than the monsters, leaving the surviving humans with little choice but to revive Godzilla and send him on an abomination-killing rampage.

Given that Godzilla is almost entirely absent from at least half of Godzilla: Final Wars, it's certainly possible for the viewer to forget that they're even watching a Godzilla movie. Kitamura seems far more interested in imbuing the film with wildly over-the-top action sequences and Matrix-inspired shenanigans than offering up anything resembling a traditional Godzilla flick, which lends the proceedings a dated, unrelentingly tedious vibe.

Having said that, the battles - when they finally arrive - are admittedly quite entertaining, though they invariably wind up overstaying their welcome by going on far longer than necessary (however, it's hard not to get a kick out of the sequence that finds the old-school Godzilla dispatching the American Godzilla with a flick of the tail). But Kitamura's inexplicable need to revel in excess (there's a space battle, for crying out loud) will undoubtedly alienate Godzilla neophytes and most likely irritate even the most die-hard fans of the legendary creature.",1216684800,3,1705,5.33457249070632

""Godzilla: Final Wars"" was the first Godzilla flick I ever actually saw in a movie theater.  I was living in Japan when it was released, and there was no way I was going to miss the chance to see the big green guy battling away on the big screen.  Man, was it cool.

This flick is the end of the Millennium series, which was one of the best of all the Godzilla incarnations.  I loved how they established some continuity, including paying homage to the original (and best) 1954&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla/dp/B000FA4TLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla</a>.  Modern special effects were used to enhance the man-in-suit action, without ever giving in to CGI and taking away everything that makes Godzilla cool.

Paying homage is what ""Final Wars"" is all about.  Pretty much every big boy that Godzilla has faced down makes an appearance, with the notable exception of Mechagodzilla, who disappeared at the end of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Godzilla-Tokyo-S-O-S/dp/B00066KWCY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Godzilla - Tokyo S.O.S.</a>.

Final Wars is not a Godzilla movie, infact Godzilla is used as the last solution against the Xillians, so don't start watching this film thinking it's going to be another Godzilla movie.

The film mainly focuses on human,mutants, and of course the Xillians but the story will keep nonkaiju and Kaiju fans interested with interesting but cleary inspired by the Matrix battle scenes. Well even a little of the plot is inspired by the Matrix, but that will only bother you at first. Anyways when Godzilla finally appears he takes on all 12 monsters, but even though the battles are quick it still entertains and makes you forget about the humans for a bit. The only monster battles the last long is the battle between Godzilla and Monster X, which is pretty awesome by the way.

Hey, If you are a Godzilla fan, you already have a great imagination!
15 Monsters! Old school fights (albeit short ones!)And Godzilla whups every last one!
Good character developement too...so you don't mind that you'd like more Godzilla.  Many differnet views and the music is modern and even tho it's not Ifukube, fits this picture.  It's just a lot of fun!",1202256000,,413,4.885714285714286
2157748,4,B00061Q6VU,"Being one of those kids who were introduced to Godzilla at the height of the popularity in the mid 1970's, when my local video store got in the new ""Millennium"" collection, I couldn't help but check this title out.  The last ""Real"" Godzilla movie (Toho production over the American debacle) in the series I got to see was Godzilla 2000"".  Though the stories and dubbing were still wanting, I was impressed by the new Godzilla suit and much improved effects (still not up to U.S. film standards, but a vast improvement over past entries).  Not seeing anything more recent on the vast trash of modern cable channels, I feared that the rumors of the Godzilla series might be over.  I was delighted to see I was wrong!
  From the very first moments this movie began to play, I realized that this was indeed, THE MOST ENTERTAINING Godzilla movie of all time!  Everything from past to present we all love, with the best Godzilla suit so far, and upgraded versions of the entire calliope of Toho studio monsters.  Godzilla fan or not, this film is all out fun!
  We begin with the explanation of Godzilla being sealed in ice, from a craft reminiscent of ""Captain Harlock"".  We then shift to all the monsters (sans Godzilla) attacking the major cities around the world (including a monster poking fun of the American travesty of Godzilla)!  The most priceless scene during this time is a New York cop trying to arrest a pimp!  From therein, we get 90 minuets of filler story, but the one thing I guarantee is that you are going to have fun seeing both throwbacks to the '70's movies and plying ""From what movie did they lift that material!""
  Highlights include: A ""scientist"" straight out of ""Inframan"", aliens in plastic / plastic armored trench-coats and wearing Devo shades, a group of mutants that resemble grey suited ""Power Rangers"" (and at times, dressed in Hugo Boss Nazi officer uniforms,  and the first non-dorky American character (the captain of the battle ship who is a Sergeant Slaughter characterature).  What keeps the 90 minuets alive is the fun of guessing from what other movies were the action scenes lifted (The Matrix, Mission Impossible, Die Hard, Independence Day and a number of Japanese movies / Anime, just to name a few).
Finally, we get down to the monster mash, which is the best yet!  Godzilla, in his best incarnation yet, is unfrozen and unleashed to take on each and every monster.  The spider and the preying mantis have new abilities and are much improved over their appearance on ""Monster Island"".  Godzilla makes quick work of them, as he does with Zilla (American version of Godzilla, done with much tong and cheek), Hidora, The Lobster, Gillera, Rodan and King Cezar.  The final battle takes place between Godzilla and Gigan / Gigan II and a monster right out of Alien, with a little intervention by Mothera.  I won't spoil the fight, other than the Alien monster turns into the best version of King Ghidora yet!  Oh, yes, and Godzilla has a new ""wind up"" and delivery of his atomic breath!  Not only that, but aside from the standard WWE moves, Godzilla, even though a guy in a rubber suit, now fights with ""Monster-Fu"" and moves more like a character out of Anime, making for much better fight scenes!
Over all, two big thumbs up to the folks at Toho for producing the BEST Godzilla installment yet!  No matter who you are, this movie is going to keep you entertained for the entire 2 hours and 5 minuets!  I'm just surprised this one didn't make it into American theaters,,,this one was definitely good enough, and the big green guy definitely has the fan base.  Oh, and one other thing...I was delighted to see a movie that didn't contain all the smut and debasement contained within every modern Hollywood feature.  Keep it up, Toho, you're definitely on the right track, and keep the Godzilla dynasty going!",1194825600,,3846,4.717065868263473

  The battle scenes are enjoyable but some of the Godzilla pairings against other monsters is short and disappointing ie., Godzilla vs. American Godzilla, Godzilla vs. giant insect(forgot name)-looks like a wasp/bee to name a few. The movie concentrates an awful lot on the xliens than the monsters and their battles itself. This may be disappointing to fans who really want to see more of the kaijus.

  The fighting sequences between the mutants-persons who posess the ""M"" gene and later the lead mutant character against the xliens and their eventual leader appear to be very ""matrixy."" These subplots detract from the main feature-our beloved kaijus.

The aforementioned ensemble exists No More. May they all rest in peace, Final Wars is a product of Japans 'Hollywood' young film makers catering and reaching out to their movie going patrons, We baby boomers should accept & embrace this new artistic expression that allows the 'Greatest' movie monster ever conceived to continue to be apart of our lives, our childrens lives and our grand children's lives. Thank you Toho for a wonderful 50 years of treasured memories. Godzilla deserves a rest, and perhaps in 10 years or so the saga will begin again.

2157754,2,B00061Q6VU,"In 2004, it was announced by Toho, that yet again, they would be retiring their famous star monster, Godzilla. Fans such as I were disappointed, but excited to hear that big shot director of Versus Ryuhei Kitamura would be helming the film, which would have the biggest budget of any previous Godzilla film, with an all star monster cast. It looked as if Godzilla was gonna go out with a bang. Godzilla: Final Wars was meant to be a collage to all previous films, especially the showa era. While it had some good concepts, the film kind of let me down. It is a decent enough pic, but wasn't good enough to be the final godzilla film...

NEGATIVES:
First off the biggest problem with the film was that Kitamura didn't seem to understand that this is a KAIJU film, not an action/martial arts film. There is far too much human action. Yeah it was cool, and in limited amounts it would have been find. But it was far too excessive. There seems to be more human fighting than monster fighting, and i often find myself having to fast forward through it to get to the good parts. Secondly, some of the simple matte shot effects look like they were done in the 60's. They are of such poor grade. It's disappointing. Also, this film brought back some of the camp (notably the whirling noise effect in the new york scene when the cop and gangsters hats blow off). This movie had the chance to show that godzilla was more than just campy cheesy sci fi and real entertainment. Also, the monster battles are so short. Especially Hedorah, who doesn't even fight Godzilla. I was most excited to see Hedorah, one of my favorite monsters return, and was sad that he got about 2 seconds of screen time. How is it that one of Godzilla's toughest opponents is killed so easily?

POSITIVES:
We get a ton of classic showa monsters, an international approach at Godzilla, Anguirus!, an awesome new monster, a creative updated approach at King ghidorah, an awesome performance from the actor who played The young lead Xian, a return of the Xians, awesome monster choreography, Don Frye has a cool character, cool style, three veteran showa actors, Updated monster designs.

As you can probably tell, the movie unfortunately is outweighed by the negatives. The movie had so much potential, but was a great let down. While I respect Kitamura as a director, I just don't think he was right for the film. They probably should have just brought back Kaneko, our modern day Ishiro Honda. It's really too bad...",1187481600,2,2480,4.631818181818182
2157755,2,B00061Q6VU,"A funny thing happened a few years ago: Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin made a big-budget ""re-imagining"" of the 1954 Japanese classic, ""Gojira."" It made $400 million dollars at the box office, and yet a few years later, if you ask 80% of internet fanboys about it, they'll scream and whine about how ""It's not really Godzilla,"" ""It sucks! Man in suit forever!"" or ""It's Godzilla in name only!"". And if you even hint that you might slightly LIKE the movie, they will tear you a new one.

So it's quite funny that a few years later, Toho decides to send the franchise back into hibernation with ""Godzilla Final Wars."" Despite what you may have read, this isn't really a Godzilla movie, or at least no more so than the 1998 re-imagining was. Godzilla is in it, sure, but it's not his movie. The movie is actually about a unit of elite genetically enhanced soldiers who have to wage battle against evil aliens, who concoct a James Bond-esque plot that somehow involves giant monsters instead of having their finger on a button. It's true that there are A LOT of monster battles in this movie, but unfortunately, they're all crammed into a montage that lasts all of five minutes.

No, the real bulk of the action scenes in the movie are centered around the super soldiers. And for what they are, they are very cool. Ryuhei Kitamaura definately knows how to assemble a good action scene involving HUMANS, no matter how ridiculous in concept they may be, and that is where the movie truly shines. It's just a shame that the monster battles, which are supposed to be the highlight of a Godzilla film, end up getting completely overshadowed by the battles featuring the human stars. While the human action scenes are fast, energetic, and acrobatic, the monster battles are for the most part slow and hokey just as they would be in any run-of-the-mill Godzilla film, which is a disappointment coming from an action director. It's as if Kitamaura just wanted to make a sci-fi karate movie, and the only way he could get the budget for one was by going through the Godzilla franchise.

In all, if you go into Godzilla Final Wars expecting a derivative chop socky sci-fi movie with really flashy martial arts fights, you'll get what you came for. But if you are one of those internet fanboys who called the American re-imagining an abomination, you should by all means despise this with almost as much mis-directed passion. Personally, I'll take both films for what they are-- decent, but flawed action flicks that don't really go out of their way to re-capture what made the first 'Zilla flick special. Grab some popcorn, unplug your brain, and don't expect to see much of big G, and you might just enjoy yourself. But remember, this is a Matrix-wannabe action movie first, and a monster movie last.

If you really want the best Godzilla movie of the past 10 years, go and get the newest version of Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla. That movie actually had some great new ideas in it, and has just about everything that make a good Kaiju film. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it over Final Wars if you just want to see a recent Godzilla movie.",1186876800,4,3140,4.652252252252253

2157759,5,B00061Q6VU,"Directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, famous for such movies as Versus & Azuma, Godzilla-Final Wars is a movie that celebrates Godzilla's long history(50 years) and proves why Godzilla is 'King of Monsters'. The story begins with many giant monsters being created as a result of Nuclear Tests. During this time, a group called The Earth Defense Force was created to do battle with these monsters, one of which was Godzilla. In the 60s, the Earth Defense Force used a Machine called the Gotengo to battle against Godzilla in Antartica. Ultimately winning by burying him under the ice. Move forward to a day in 2004, when all at once, the many monsters the Earth Defense Force once battled began attacking major cities all over the world. As the Force begins to battle them, the monsters begin to disappear in a flash of light & UFOs rush away from the scene. At the Force's Headquarters in Tokyo, the UFOs mothership appears and a group of aliens known as the Xilians introduce themselves to the world. They proceed to tell them that a planet is headed for Earth but, only with their help, will it be saved. Only you find out later that their intentions weren't like that at all. When the Xilians began attacking the Earth with the giant monsters it had previously saved the Earth from, the Earth Defense Force realizes the only way they can save the day is by releasing Godzilla from his icy tomb. Save the day, Godzilla does, as he goes onto fight the likes of Gigan-Zilla(our american Godzilla, which wasn't Godzilla at all)-Kumonga-Kamacuras- Anguirus-Rodan-King Caesar-Hedorah-Ebirah-MonsterX- & finally Kaiser King Ghidorah. Mothra tries to aid Godzilla, as he does in many Godzilla movies, by fighting a new improved Gigan. While Mothra is hurt by Gigan, Mothra still manages to beat Gigan. Without giving away too much about the rest of the movie, let me just say that this movie has to be the most intense and serious Godzilla movie I've seen in years. Departing from the normal Godzilla movie fare, Final Wars is nothing but wall-to-wall action scenes. After seeing it in original Japanese language with English subtitles, I'll probably never watch another Godzilla movie with English voiceovers(which is a good thing, anyway, as most of the English voiceovers make it seem too campy). Sadly, Godzilla-Final Wars marks Godzilla's last appearance on these shores(or Japan's for that matter) for-at least- five to ten years to reignite interest in the franchise. What a way to go out, though. This has to be my most favorite Godzilla movie of all-time next to Godzilla-King of Monsters. It's a movie that gives me hope that Toho will take Godzilla in a new and exciting direction(with new monsters & storylines) when they do decide to bring the franchise back. Who knows, maybe Godzilla will last another 50 years. You never know. Even though there have been great movies as well as crappy movies in the franchise, Godzilla has lasted this long. There's something to be said for that.

If you're a diehard fan or someone who hasn't seen a Godzilla movie since the 70s when he was hugely popular here, you've got to see this movie. It will renew your interest in the series. Trust me.",1183248000,2,3181,4.858195211786372

The film that marked the 50yr anniversary of Godzilla turns out to be at the same standard (story, special effects, etc) as watching the Power Rangers tv series. The only thing going for this movie is some of the updated designs of some of the monsters, but their appearance on screen is so short and fleeting, that it makes you annoyed by the main story, which highlights a band of mutant special forces (amalgamated rip-off of X-Men, Matrix, & Power Rangers) that fight an alien invasion. Very Cheesy.

  Oh, and it's hard to forget the terrible score (using mostly irritating organ music), as much as you might want to.

  Toho USED to be innovative with Godzilla and the other Kaiju (monsters) back in the 50's and early 60's, but the studio is still stuck in believing they still live in that era in their glory days. Godzilla and the rest of the monsters definately deserves upgrades and more innovation that these monster films have the potential to be, but Toho definately dropped the ball on this one. Plus, they claim this is to be the LAST Godzilla movie. What a huge disappointment.

2157763,1,B00061Q6VU,"I really hate that this movie is as bad as it is.  I'm a huge Godzilla nut (have been since I was 4) and have even gone so far as import Godzilla DVDs from Japan and Hong Kong in order to see films before they were released stateside.  In fact, I originally saw this film in the form of a ::cough:: archival copy from Thailand.  Rest assured, however, that I also have the U.S. release, so I'm not basing my review on a bootleg version.

""Final Wars""  is Godzilla's 50th anniversary film and was intended to blend the best aspects of the Godzilla series into a single movie and allow the character to bow out in style.  Instead what seems to have happened is that Ryuhei Kitamura was making a cheap Matrix rip-off and was then hired to paste a few scenes with Godzilla in them into his lame martial arts film.  Rest assured that though there are more than dozen monsters in Final Wars, most of them are around for mere minutes before being obliterated so we can quickly get back to the badly scripted, poorly choreographed human action.  Bizarrely, GODZILLA HIMSELF barely makes an appearance until the final act of the film.  Beloved monsters such as Hedora, Anguiras, and King Seesar really, truly, have maybe 8 minutes of screen time total between them.  All the while, however, Kitamura's cookie cutter heroes drone on and on and fight battle after unimpressive battle.

When the monsters do finally get to fight (And it's rare- There's about 30 minutes of monsters in this 2 hour long film), the action is solely based on the goofy, ""Showa era"" films of the 60s and 70s, with monsters smiting each other with pro wrestling moves, doing comic takes and pratfalls, and even having goofy sound effects like tires squealing when they come to a stop.  This movie was not made for Godzilla fans: It was made, by all appearances, to cater to the stereotypes about giant monster films as silly kiddie fare.  If you actually want to see a good modern Godzilla film, I would recommend ""Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All Out Attack"".  You'll enjoy it far more than this farce.  If you like goofy monster wrestling, then buy all means look into the classic Godzilla films like ""Godzilla vs. Gigan"" and ""Godzilla vs. the Sea Monster""- they're far more entertaining as well.

""Godzilla Final Wars"" is a terrible film, doubly so for actual Godzilla fans.  I recommend it only for the morbidly curious or completists who absolutely have to have every Godzilla film.",1176163200,27,2472,4.685185185185185

My Godzilla collection is expansive, and almost complete. Out of the new breed of Godzilla movies (the ones I didn't grow up on), this is clearly one of the best, with perhaps Godzilla 2000 claiming that prize...but maybe that's because I got to see it in the theater...salivating...

My favorite scene in Final Wars has to be when the Americanized Godzilla (gag) shows up and dukes it out with the real deal. I think the guys in Japan were trying to make a statement when, with little effort, Godzilla puts an end to the little American runt. I was clapping.

Over all, Final Wars is fairly fast paced and very stylized. In many ways this smacks of Manga/Japanimation cartoons, but that's fine by me, because those are beautiful movies too. So, five stars for Final Wars. There's nothing better than popping in a Godzilla flick and working on novel ideas.

I enjoyed much of the movie and some parts made me remember why I loved Godzilla so much as a kid.  The fight scenes were pretty amazing, especially later on in the movie.  The special effects have been updated significantly and prodution values were obviously very high.  Yes, Godzilla is still a suit, but he wouldn't be Godzilla any other way.  It's an amazing feeling watching Godzilla make short work (sometimes too short) of his advesaries.  It's an all against one, a la Destroy All Monsters, but much darker and extremely flashy.

The acting can be especially horrible at times, and the lack of charisma among the lead characters (except the General -- his delivery was extremely cheesy and corny, but he actually became my favorite character) did not help.  Story isn't very good, and it seems they tried to tack on a love story, which is not nescessary in a Godzilla film.  Speaking of unescessary, the martial arts scenes brought about images of suicide.  Okay, they're not that bad, but its just not what people want to see in a movie of this genre.  Glad to see them try to add new elements to the series, but maybe this could have waited.

Final Thoughts:

~Plot: 6 - Nothing very interesting, love story attempt?? weak at best

~Presentation: 6 - DVD has few features, acting is good to horrible

~Special Effects: 10 - It's not Star Wars or T3, but it has awesome Godzilla effects that make the fight scenes that much more enjoyable

~Sound: 8 - Enjoyable at times, and sometimes just average

~Action: 9 - Some questionable scenes, and some monsters are defeated too easily, but very well done

OVERALL: 8.4 (not an average)",1162166400,,1934,4.6158357771261

The problem with this movie is the damn director (who's idea within TOHO PRODUCTIONS was it to give this project to him?) didn't really care that it's a 50 year tribute to the awesomest science fiction character in history, compared to how he cared that everyone should think he's a great ""action movie director"" who could make great ""action scenes"", of people. 5 other people have said it and they're right, this movie thanks to the makers of it comes across like it's about people, not about Godzilla. I don't know who's idea it was to put this scene in the movie, but everyone before you decide on a total ~stink~ rating, I must draw your attention to one part of the movie where Godzilla IS treated with awe, as a powerful monster with senses, and intelligence even: THIS SCENE is when Monster X, in the form of a big meteor is coming down from space, and Godzilla stops in his tracks ... pauses ... looks up, with a deliberateness about him ... sees the meteor ... pounds his clawed feet into the earth, to brace himself and unleashes a super intense blast of his radioactive breath that blasts out into space and hits the meteor. In this powerful moment it's shown Godzilla inherently knows this is something very bad, this is something unknown but a threat ... he may not be able to destroy it but he's gonna blast it with all his might. (Notice when Monster X does appear, he appears to have his right eye out - it's not red ... Godzilla's blast did something). This scene is magnificent. The whole movie wasn't like that, as the first part of my review explains, but if it would have been it would be a five star. The frustration is the makers didn't know or didn't care that that scene, that type of stuff is THE REASON people watch a Godzilla flick.
Having said that, the above mentioned scene shows what Godzilla IS - and there was NOTHING like that in the joke 1998 American flick.  They could have called the monster 'Bob'.",1161561600,2,2101,4.428940568475452

Silly aliens wearing absurd costumes speaking ludicrious dialogue.  Granted, alot gets lost in the translation from Japanese to English, but the ""people talking"" scenes are truely painful to listen to. All of the sword fighting is ridiculous and unneccessary in a Godzilla film.

Godzilla's fights with other monsters early in the film had too much ""monster humor"" for my taste.  It was cartoonish, the way Godzilla would celebrate, and the defeated monsters would crumple on top of eachother.  Rather than being battles between vicious monsters, they came off as pro wrestling matches.

The only serious, and good, monster action was at the end when Godzilla faced Monster X, and Kaiser Ghidora; but by then the climactic battles seemed out of place, since the first hour and a half of the film was so silly.",1158796800,8,930,4.967741935483871

I am a hardcore Godzilla fan - I even liked the movies with the smog monster, Megalon, and the kid who daydreamed that he was a friend of Godzilla's son but ""Final Wars"" I hated like Bush sr. hates brocolli.

The movie pretty much tries to be an update or remake of the classic Godzilla movie ""Destroy all monsters"", where aliens come to this planet and pretend to be our friends but the only one who can save us is Godzilla.

Seems like a good premise but unfortunately they try to add in mutants (ala X-men rip-off), an alien take-over conspiracy, and the hand-to-hand combat between the people is a mix of Power Rangers and Matrix-wannabe.  The acting is stilted and terrible, to match with the terrible direction of the movie.

At least the director did not mess up the monster battles and the only bright spot was Godzilla whooping the US version with a flick of his tail.

Whatever you do - Just rent this movie!!!

Then form a petition to Sony/Toho Studios to make another Godzilla film using the same creative group that made that GMK (Godzilla-Mothra-King Ghidorha), they also made that recent excellent Gamera trillogy - let's see if we can get a Godzilla Trilogy to properly send the Big G off.",1154044800,10,1384,4.530120481927711

Final Wars is basically a remake. I watched Final Wars with a couple of ten year olds, and had a pretty good time. It is an action extravaganza compared to the original. My kids loved the monster stuff, but there is just too much Matrix-type fighting. We were pumped when the monsters came out-but man, those flash cuts and 20 second fights just didn't make up for lots of tedious non-monster drama. We hooted over Captain Gordon, the American who looks a like a Russian Cossack with a samurai sword. His power seems to be derived from a gigantic black moustache that channels his authority. His lines are all growled with deadpan flair and he's apparently the only person in Japan who can make important decisions. The monster fights range from funny to awesome. As in most of the Millenium movies, the best is saved for last. We loved the ridiculous soccer match with Rodan, Anguilles and King Caesar. Am I the only person who heard King Caesar rip a huge fart when Godzilla hoists him up for a pitch? Which reminds me, the sound editing on these Millenium flicks is a big draw. The surround sound gets a real workout when Godzilla comes to town. Also, Baby Godzilla is not funny, just lame.

2157783,3,B00061Q6VU,"I will make this short, as this film has been synopsized and reviewed by almost everyone in the kaiju fnadom, who either love it with all their hearts and call it the best Godzilla movie ever, or hate it to the very pit of their souls. I'm in between.

The only thing that holds this movie together and keeps it from being absolute trash is the charisma that flows throughout the film. Every single kaiju battle is fast paced and intense, which (barely) makes up for their shortness. They may be only minutes or seconds long, but they are well-spent, fun minutes and seconds.

Many Kaiju veterans return in this movie, and their presence is a treat for long-time fans. However, many of the new actors are unskilled and boring, except for the well-acted, over-the-top alien leader (sorry, don't know eh actors name) and American Don Frye, who is hilariously cheesy and funny.

The script is okay, nothing special.

What irks me the most is that this movie was obviously made to be all about Godzilla and the other monsters, yet some of the movie's greatest flaws are with the monsters and the monster battles. Most of the re-designed monster look great, except for King Ceaser, whose suit is way to form fitting to the suit actor and looks very fake, and the Godzilla suit just doesn't do it for me. It looks a little to slim, and the face is a bit to rat-like. The new monster, Monster X, was okay. My big issue here is that he was really hyped up before the film's premeire, and he turned out to be an average, not-very-special bi-pedal monster that, after a few minutes of fighting (SPOILER WARNING) turned into (ANOTHER SPOLIER WARNING) King Ghidora. He was really nothing special.

The last thing I want to comment on is the score. It's okay, not spectacular, and only a couple of the themes stand out. Sadly, like the rest of the film, it was mostly forgettable.

This movie will appeal to Godzilla fans who grew up loving the campy, butchered Godzilla movies shown on TV every weekend. However, those who like Godzilla in his role as a dark, serious monster will find Final Wars boring and cheesy. I shift moe towards the latter group, and I myself prefer entrys such as GMK over Final Wars. All in all, a mediocre way to celebrate Godzilla's 50th birthday.",1150848000,,2263,4.589108910891089

2157785,4,B00061Q6VU,"Let me just say this about Godzilla Movies in general: Forget about trying to understand the ""plot"", if there was one to start with, it gets lost in translation/dubbing to English and none of these Millenium Series movies makes any sense at all. They seem to be an odd mix of fantasy, sci-fi, horror and drama. You really need to take a leap of faith into the Godzilla Universe to sit through an entire movie, the dialog and themes are hard to take. I'd say it probably boils down to nothing more than a difference between Japaneese and American story telling sensibilities. After watching the whole thing, My son and I like to watch it again a time or two, but we jump right to the best Monster battle scenes - that's the beauty of the DVD format, you can go right to the good stuff and pass up all the weird parts in between.

  That said, the MS movies are absolutely awesome. Compared to the older ""guy-in-suit"" Godzilla Movies, the new ones (90's-2000's) are cutting edge. They have mind blowing special effects, huge sets of cities built with models, and they seem to have a creepy, chilling, & darker look to the night scenes. The ""behind the scenes"" part is neat, showing how they shoot the films - just as enjoyable as the movie.

  Final Wars is great because Godzilla tears through an entire army of bad monsters by crushing, throwing, stomping, and blasting away with his Atomic breath. The new improved Gigan with buzz saws for arms is awesome.",1149379200,5,1457,4.563218390804598
2157786,3,B00061Q6VU,"Through the rosy lens of nostalgia, Godzilla movies always seem better than they actually were. It never fails. ""Godzilla vs. Megalon"" was WAY more entertaining when I was five years old. I can't sit through it now. So I didn't expect much more from ""Godzilla Final Wars"". However, I ended up enjoying it.

""Final Wars"" isn't the greatest movie ever, but it's pretty engaging-- partially because of the appearance of so many monsters (yeah, they're still cheesy rubber suits), but also because of the campy action storyline.

A team of mutants created to help rid the world of monsters isn't the most original idea... and the execution was fairly laughable at times. But after 50 years of Godzilla flicks, I didn't expect a sci-fi masterpiece. I just wanted a touch of nostalgia, some eye candy, and a good laugh or two.

Godzilla movies are basically cartoons, and this one was fun. If you're already into Godzilla, you'll LOVE this movie.

As a side note, watch for the American tough guy-- he embodies the stereotypical mustachioed commander found in so many old anime (""Starblazers"" and ""Robotech"" spring to mind). He'll probably make you chuckle.",1149033600,,1151,4.948186528497409

2157788,3,B00061Q6VU,"As some of my esteemed fellow reviewers have stated before, this movie's plot is quite similar to 1968's ""Destroy All Monsters"". However, unlike ""Destroy all Monsters"", the aliens in this one, called the Xilians, present themselves as the saviors of the planet and kindly dispose of numerous monsters that are wreaking havoc all over the planet, including Rodan, King Caesar, Anguirus, and Ebirah. One particularly good action sequence has several humans battling Ebirah (the giant lobster) using bazooka-like weapons.

Eventually, we the audience learn that the Xilians want to conquer the planet, and their current leader wants to do so in a non-violent way, not wanting to use force as a first resort. However, his second-in-command, the typical young, brash, arrogant would-be-commander, murders his superior in a ""who-didn't-see-that-coming"" moment, and takes over command of the Xilians. He then releases the monsters, who proceed to start trashing the planet. A group of soldiers, led by Captain Gordon (played perfectly by former UFC champion Don ""The Predator"" Frye), conclude that the planet's last hope is to release Godzilla from his icy prison in Antarctica, where he has been slumbering for decades. Afterwards, a series of brief monster fights ensue as Godzilla is lured towards the Xilian's mothership, culminating in the climactic battle between Godzilla and Monster X, the film's new antagonist. There have been mixed reactions on Monster X, but I think he looks pretty cool, and his meancing appearance and method of arrival definitely signal that he's not going to be a pushover like the other monsters.

This is perhaps the longest Godzilla movie, clocking in right around 2 hours, and despite this the human characters are not developed very well, even though the actors do an adequate job. Godzilla himself doesn't appear until well after the 1-hour mark, not counting his brief appearance at the very beginning. The numerous ""Matrix"" knock-offs didn't bug me nearly as much as Godzilla's lack of screen time: this is supposed to be his 50th birthday bash, right? I actually thought that the motorcycle fight scene was pretty cool; in all, there is actually quite a lot of action in this movie, just not a whole lot of giant-monster action.

As for the monsters themselves, most of them look pretty good, redone after long absences, in some cases over two decades. The redone Gigan is easily the most improved over his original appearance, and you can tell a lot of effort went into revamping his look, even if he has limited screen time. I think that the makers intentionally made the CGI-rendered ""American Godzilla"" look a little more ""fake"", to signal that he isn't the real Godzilla, right before he gets roasted in what is generally considered to be the shortest giant monster fight in history (the Xilian leader's reaction to this is priceless). Godzilla himself looks pretty good in my opinion; his look is closer to the 90's Godzilla as opposed to the ""millennium"" Godzilla, even if his facial expressions aren't as obvious and his head has a rat-like appearance. Of course, a movie such as this wouldn't be complete without an appearance by Godzilla's arch-nemesis, Ghidora, who appears looking quite menacing in his blue-trimmed ""Kaiser"" form towards the end. It's rumored that Mechagodzilla was also going to make an appearance, but time and budget constraints forced it to be left out. Excluding Mechagodzilla, all of the ""classic"" Godzilla monsters and enemies are here. I guess nobody's upset that the likes of Titanosaurus and Megalon didn't come to the party. Mothra's appearance is so brief that I wouldn't call it much more than a cameo, and her death while aiding Godzilla against Gigan and Monster X is so sudden that it lacks any impact, probably because the human's don't express anything about it.

My gripe about this movie can be summed up like this: Not enough Godzilla, and surprisingly little giant monster action. Given how long it takes for Godzilla to appear, the subsequent fights are necessarily short (or else the movie would have been over 3 hours long), making Godzilla seem over-powered and the other monstsers, except for Monster X and Kaiser Ghidora, seem like pansies. The movie has plenty of good points: the concept and story are pretty good, the visual effects are well-done, and Don Frye effortlessly delivers all of the best one-liners. If a few things had been done differently here and there, this film could have easily been a five-star one. All in all, it's not the worst Godzilla flick, but a times I got the feeling that it was trying really hard to be the best and just fell a little flat.",1148169600,,4665,5.023255813953488

Similar: Both had fighting. The battle scenes between Jane and J Lo were not quite as action packed as the battle scenes between Godzilla and his foes, but they were definitely funnier.

Similar: Jane and J Lo acted as well together as Godzilla and Mothra; the supporting cast in Monster-in-Law was on par with the acting of the supporting cast of Final Wars.

Opposite ends of the spectrum: In Monster-in-Law the predictable ""you-go-girl"" style of comic relief provided by Wanda Sykes' character Ruby was as good as any of the Jane/J Lo battle dialogue. But in Final Wars the, drawn out, predictable campyness and unintentional comedy of the dubbed dialogue took away from the cool monster battles.

Opposite ends of the spectrum: In Final Wars there were political overtones over The World's use of nuclear devices, but in Monster-in-Law Jane checked her political views at the door.

If I had to do it all over again with the choice of watching only one of the two films I guess it would be Monster-in-Law. After all, while the politics of Jane and Godzilla are equally silly, at least Jane doesn't use Monster-in-Law to express any of her views.

While political films clearly aren't my thing, I must say that I am relatively excited about a new blockbuster in the works....It's a joint sequel to two recent films (Fahrenheit 9/11 & King Kong) with the preproduction operating title of Moore Kong. The two respective giant monster stars from both of their original films return and battle each other over control of US popular opinion. Can't wait!...I know who I'll be rooting for!",1142121600,6,2045,4.910144927536232
2157801,3,B00061Q6VU,"The monster designs and the effects were great, plus there were a few cool action scenes and some humor too. But there was way too much of that Yuen Wo Ping style wire-fu and the John Woo ""bullet ballet"" going on. It got old really quick. And when the giant monsters started doing it too, along with New Japan Wrestling moves, it was just a little much.

Actually, this movie almost seems like a remake of ""Destroy All Monsters"", where aliens unleash the monsters from Monster Island upon major cities in an attempt to take over the world. Except in this film, the monsters hardly show up; especially the star of the show, Godzilla. He appears in the first 5 minutes, but is not seen or mentioned for about another hour into the movie. By this time you're thinking, ""Wait a minute, isn't this a Godzilla flick? Where's Godzilla?!"".

In the meantime, we're subjected to the angsty ""mutant"" Earth Defense Force (starring Kane Kosugi, son of Sho Kosugi... star of many 80's ninja flicks), and alien invaders who look like rejects from The Matrix; complete with black plastic trenchcoats. When the Big G does finally show up, his fights with the other monsters were way too short... except for Godzilla's last fight which was pretty good. But it kept getting interrupted by the final fight between the mutant human character and the aliens; whom I could care less about at that point in the film.

Overall, this film has some nice visuals and some great monster cameos (King Seesar. Gigan, and the american Godzilla), but the plot is lacking, unoriginal and is heavily influenced by ""The Matrix"" films, with some ""Independence Day"", ""Star Wars"", ""Equilbrium"", and ""Mission Impossible 2"", thrown in, with a dash of ""Destroy all Monsters"". I guess I shouldn't expect much from the director of ""Versus"".",1141948800,5,1796,4.805825242718447
2157802,4,B00061Q6VU,"As you may have gathered from my title, this movie is awesome.  I suppose I'll get my two complaints out of the way.  First of all it's not got quite the proper ratio of monster violence to other stuff.  There's a whole lotta monster mashing, yes, but at 2 hours and 5 minutes it could've stood to have a little more, or just have been a bit shorter.  The monster's generally look great, and they are, as a whole mostly of the rubber-suit variety, though there is quite a bit of CGI too, particularly for Zilla and the flying monsters.  Still, they usually tried to use conventional fx so long as they were feasible, and they generally allow for the best results.  I dunno about you, but there's just something about watching two dudes in  rubber suits have a fist fight that makes me very, very happy.  The only notable absence with regard to the monsters is the lack of Megalon, but what ya gonna do.  Ya got Rodan, the Seamonster, Anguirah, King Ghidorah, Gigan, Mothra, the G-Man himself and more.  I also would've liked to see a bit more city smashin'.  If there's anything that I like more than watching to rubber-suited men duke it out, it's seeing a besuited man smash a miniature city.  Particularly the tanks, definitely needed more tank smashing.  My other major complaint is the lack of classic Godzilla music.  The modern stuff is okay, generally, but I love the classic Godzilla themes, so they shoulda had more of  that stuff.  Nevertheless, these complaints are lost in a sea of deliciously cheesy dialogue, costumes, sets and monster action.  Seriously, how anyone could watch this movie and not have a helluva good time is beyond me.  Yes, it's got a bit too much people, not quite enough monsters, but that's always been the way with Godzilla movies, from my experience.  And the non-monster stuff here is generally a whole lot more entertaining than what you'd find in other Godzilla movies.

The movie does have a lotta hand to hand action, generally of the 'Matrix' knockoff variety. (This was directed by the dude who directed 'Versus', so this should come as no surprise.)  It's pretty damn over the top, but that's the manner of the whole film, of course, so I can't knock it too much.  It's got amusingly hammy performances too, particularly from the main villain with evil eyebrows and the American captain.

Again, this is a very goofy film, but it's goofy-fun rather than goofy-moronic, so it works very well.  Personally, despite the very modern nature of most of the film, I still think it manages to have the same basic tone of an older Godzilla film, which makes it a fitting enough anniversary feature.

Yeah, this is fun.  Check it out.

It is great fun to see him quickly dispose of said monsters, particularly the ""American Godzilla"".  The traditional Godzilla theme music is heard only in the opening title; the rest is techno-pop and generally pretty poor, except for the climactic final scene.

The intervening sixty minutes is spent unveiling the alien plot and how a special group of mutants attempts to thwart it.  Way too much Matrix-style fighting.

The head alien after bragging about their superiority throws one of the funniest hissy fits when his monsters lose. Like most giant moster movies you can't get enough of the monsters.

2157822,2,B00061Q6VU,"My title sums it. This is a very bad movie. Very bad. I can't really begin to describe how bad it is because I don't know where to start. I'll name ten things about it that suck right off:

1. The absence of Godzilla (throughout half of the movie at least)

2. The presence of Minilla (always bad)

3. The absence of the original Godzilla theme (come on).

4. The soundtrack (horrifying in the extreme and deserving of its  own paragraph)

5. The unexplained appearance and continued inclusion of a Japanese guy dressed as a minute-man from the American Revolutionary War

6. A horrifying alien villian, X, who ranks among the most despicable film characters I have ever seen

7. Short monster fights (with the exception of Godzilla vs. GINO, which was realistically short)

8. An equally annoying, wussy Neo-ripoff as a hero.

9. Don Fyre as the ""baddest man on earth"" who is consistently annoying, since he dresses like Stalin and is constantly in his 'bad man' pose. Not to mention that he seems to think near the end that he can fight Godzilla with a samurai sword.

10. Overuse of bad CGI

Don't get me wrong; there's plenty more wrong with this movie. But I can't really review it. You know what the story is about - aliens invade and convince a host of mosnters to fight Godzilla. I don't really care about this movie ripping off the Matrix since the sequels ruined that movie to begin with, but it's really tiring and irritating to see that the human ""sub-plot"" (not really a sub-plot, since it takes up about 75% of the movie) is basically an alien invasion movie with the heros and villians wearing Matrix-style costumes, with a little bit of Star Wars thrown it. But the fact that they negate Godzilla himself through most of it is what really grieves me; this sould just be called ""Final Wars"" and not allude to Godzilla at all. The fights are too short and Showa-ish, though seeing him take down GINO was the highlight of the movie (all six seconds of the scene, anyway).

It sucks, just trust in the reviews of those before me who were better able to sum it up. Don't see it if you like the more serious Godzilla movies; however, if 'Destroy All Monsters' and 'Godzilla vs. Megalon' were your type of G-movies, then by all means see it; you will love it.

But even though it sucks, it is still a fun movie to watch. It doesn't offer the corniness and campiness of any Godzilla movie, but an over-abundance of it. A good example it the New York scene. You probably will have fun watching this movie, like any other G-movie, but just not for the reasons you would find any other G-movie fun. And by the way. . .

2157823,1,B00061Q6VU,"I have been a Godzilla fan since the time I first saw the Raymond Burr version on TV. The local UHF station used to show Godzilla movies, and I loved them. I even stayed with him when he went from villain to Earth's defender (although I never cared for him in that role). I think my interest wained when Godzilla's son Minya came along. And then came the saddest bunch of villain monsters that ever stomped across a movie set.

When he was reborn in ""Godzilla 1985"", I was thrilled. He had been returned to his roots. An unstoppable force of nature that had to be dealt with.

Then came the second round of reborn Big G flicks- starting with ""Godzilla vs. Biollante"". Wow. Up to date techniques and a cool looking Godzilla! Over the next few years, many cool Godzilla movies with him as the ""bad guy"" were made.

Then things started to drift again- about the time they made ""Godzilla v Space Godzilla"".  I still caught all of them, though. And in many cases, TOHO said that ""this would be the last one"".

Well, now we are up to ""Godzilla Final Wars"".  I looked forward to it. However... fellow Godzilla fans were sensing a disturbance in the force.  There were some that were saying this movie was... lousy!  Despite these dire warnings, I bought it.

Words cannot express my disappointment. Toho had jump started their Big G series by dumping the stupid monsters of the 60s and early 70s- Gigan, Hedorah, Varan, Ebirah, King Caeser etc.  They had even dumped Minya.  Well, here they all were again, and it wasn't a Happy Homecoming.

The plot was basically a reworking of the 1960s ""Destroy All Monsters"".  There were a lot of homages to past Big G films.  But it didn't click.  The SPFX ranged from passable to lousy (the monster Zilla, based on the American Godzilla, was downright awful CGI, and didn't blend in with its scenes with Big G). 1/3 of the story is filled with Matrix style fighting between humans and aliens. And the worst part was they brought back Minya- here called Minilla or some such. Ugh.

I wanted to like this movie. I really did. But it was a chore to endure this film.

Toho has said before that they were making the ""last"" Godzilla movie.  I am hoping that Big G does come back again.  He deserved a better ending than this one.

2157840,5,B00061Q6VU,"Final Wars is a fun film; But, I'd really like to address an important issue here. The fact that most Americans still believe that Godzilla hasn't made

a new movie since the mid seventies.  I often meet people who express total surprise that that the series is still in production. And I also meet people who have a total misconception about  Godzilla films in general.

When  discribing a Godzilla film it is common for (young people in particular)  to exagerate the quality of Godzilla's movies. ""Its a guy in a fake looking rubber suit with a visible zipper down the back stepping on cheap toys"" , I often hear.  Its all just a big misconception really, and the criticisms seem to be only pointed at japanese made sci fi films. Are the special effect in, Oh, say ""Monster Zero"" that far off in quality from Disney's ""Moon Pilot"" or ""You Only Live Twice""? Of course not. are rubber suits such an awful way to create a monster?  The ALIEN is a rubber suit. So are the PREDATOR, Chewbacca, Jason etc. (and Ive never seen a zipper on Godzilla.) It is obvious to me that , despite the availability of most of Godzilla's movies on DVD, this is a generation that was brought up without these films.  As a child in the 1970s and '80s I saw the movies on TV regularly, and it was common for the kids in the neighborhood to drop everything and run inside if a Japanese monster film was showing on the afterschool 4 o'clock movie.

 The image that is in americans minds is the Dean Devlin 1998 abomination (which, despite the huge effects budget resembles a man in a suit more than any Japanese film), and I'm afraid this will probably not change for a very long time.

Why?

Because of the low profile release of every Godzilla film in the US

since GODZILLA vs. MEGALON in 1975.  SInce then, all G films were released with  no publicity at all  (G vs. Gigan/Mechagodzilla), very little publicity (G 1985/2000), Directly to TV (Terror of MechaG) or in most casses since the 1980s directly to home video or DVD.  As a result of this,  the few who remember GODZILLA 1985  aren't awhare that the series even continued after that year at all.  Columbia/Tri-Star even

blocked the release of  the previous 5 Godzilla films (G vs. King Ghidorah 1991- vs. Destoroyah 95) while promoting their own movie in 1998. It's all so sad.  The empoyees at a video store I frequent (ages 16-27) didn't even realize that the DVD's they have been stocking and selling were of new Godzilla films. They simply assumed these were all ""old"" movies.  When I asked two of the kids when they thought Godzilla films were made/released. They said that they really weren't sure and settled on the generic in the ""OLD DAYS"" answer. (Boy, did I feel old, and I'm only 34) One of them said that he assumed that all the Godzilla films were in BLACK & WHITE!!!!! and believed that they started making them around the same time as KING KONG!!! (I pressed these two knuckleheads further and learned that they had no idea when the Atomic Bomb was invented and all they could tell me about World War II was that it started ""because of racism"" and that we dropped the A-Bomb to ""whipe out the Japanese race"". They weren't really sure who was on which side and were surprised when I told them Italy was involved and about the battles in North Africa. Scary. I guess I shouldn't worry so much about monster movies. )

Anyway, people really should see the new ( and ""OLD"") films in the Godzilla series. Maybe then the misconceptions would stop.

 But I doubt it.

For the record, there have been 13 Godzilla films released from 1985 to 2004. Thats 28 total.  29 if you count the Tri-Star piece of cr@p. (and

 I thought this movie was awesome and very strange but in a good way and that they should be like this more often in the near future when he comes back into cinimas. the many ""rip-offs"" are mostly homeages to the directors favorate movies and i found that realy cool. and to many Godzilla fans like my self, it had little easter eggs to our favorate Godzilla movies and found that was very cool of him to put in.

the only bad thing I found in the movie was the short monster fights and maby a little to much people time, but other then that I did not mind and I found the actors in this movie to be quite enjoyable.

this was a great movie and liked it very much and watch alot. Godzilla never looked better and was great to see the classic monsters such as Rodan, Manda, etc. and its always fun to watch Godzilla trash GINO. and also i found the soundtrack to the movie awesome and that putting ""were all to blame"" by Sum41 (one of my favorate rock bands) in the movie with the Godzilla/GINO scene cool.

this is a great Godzilla flick and i think people should give it a try or at least rent it first before buying because some my not like it, but i think alot of people find this movie quite fun to watch.",1138147200,,1297,4.090551181102362
2157842,3,B00061Q6VU,"""Gojira: Fainaru Uzu"" - a.k.a. ""Godzilla: Final Wars"" - can be summed up in one word: 'different'.  Actually, make that two words: 'very different'.  In 2004, the 50th anniversary of the original 1954 classic ""Gojira"", Toho announced that they would be making the final Godzilla movie for a period of at least a decade.  The film would feature many - most, in fact - of Godzilla's classic friends and foes, to celebrate the anniversary, as well as the end of the ""Millennium"" series of G-films.

So how does ""Final Wars"" do as a finale to the latest and, arguably, greatest of the Godzilla series?  Well ... read on.

The premise of ""Final Wars"" is far more complex than that of any other Godzilla movie.  It's the near future.  Godzilla has been imprisoned in ice for about forty or fifty years.  Other monsters have remained hidden in the darkest corners of the Earth.  A race of superhuman mutants have been created and used by the government to battle crime; the group has been named ""M-Unit"".  Suddenly, the Secretary General of the United Nations (Akira Takarada) disappears.  When he returns about a day later, he presents to Earth an alien race called Xilians.  The race seems peaceful as they warn Earth about an asteroid heading towards the planet which will destroy it upon impact.  They suggest that we unite and form the Space Nations.  But a group of government workers suspect that all is not as it seems ...

""Godzilla: Final Wars"" is directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, an apparently skilled director who also directed the popular cult film ""Versus"".  Kitamura also contributes to the script, which is for the most part well-written, though it features some definite weak parts (most notably when a character makes a miraculous, seemingly impossible escape from imprisonment, and then explains it with ""I managed to escape somehow"").  The storyline is basically a re-working of ""Monster Zero""'s story, with certain new elements added.  The film starts off well and continues along well until the action really gets started; at this point, the train goes flying off the tracks and then keeps going.  What I'm trying to say is that this film eventually becomes way too wacky and it keeps getting wackier.  Towards the end of the film, the movie becomes an obvious rip-off of ""The Matrix"".

The greatest part of the film is the monsters.  We see many monsters which we haven't seen since the original series, including Angilas, Gigan, Kumonga, Ebirah, and even Hedorah and King Shisa!  Unfortunately, we also see Minilla, who really does nothing for the film at all.  The monsters look cool and the special effects are very good.  Unfortunately, the monsters get very little screen time; even Godzilla is in the film for a grand total of about ten minutes.  A very interesting thing about the film is that it features the American Godzilla - here called ""Zilla"" - as one of the monsters!  He is eliminated very quickly by Godzilla, though.  It's a wonderful way for the Japanese to show Roland Emmerich and Dean Devlin that their Godzilla is still the King of the Monsters.

The only other high point of the film which I can recall is the score, which includes new music by Keith Emerson.  Very little of Akira Ifukube's classic music is used.  There is quite a bit of American music used in the film, including a song by Sum 41.

""Godzilla: Final Wars"" is a bizarre film.  It feels more like some weird Japanese ""Matrix"" rip-off than a Godzilla film, primarily because the monsters have little screentime and are not essential to the storyline.  It's a unique and interesting film to be sure, but it's flaws and the near-absence of anything we've come to love in the Godzilla films makes this a less-than-spectacular way to close of the ""Millennium"" series.  Had this been just another entry in the series, I might like it more.  And had the series closed with the fantastic ""Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah"", all the fans would be much happier.",1137801600,,3953,4.802962962962963
2157843,3,B00061Q6VU,"I'm guessing if your reading this review you have probably heard both good and bad things about this movie, I'm happy to report many of the good things are true, but so are the bad.

WARNING SOME SPOILERS MAY FOLLOW

The movie started off good enough, with an impressive battle between Godzilla and the Gotengo(human battleship)the ship manages to incase Big G in ice(they were battling in antartica). Fast forward a few years and when have yet another impressive battle between the Gotengo and this time Manda, underwater I might add, and even though we don't see Manda very long, he was none the less impressive.

I won't go into to much detail, but eventually we found out that their are a bunch of mutants running around with very Matrix like powers and then eventually a bunch of monsters start running around major cities, it was great to see some old faces.

I won't say anymore about this, but eventually the Xillians show up who are aliens and they claim do destroy the monsters. Then it's found out that their the real bad guys, yeah didn't see that coming. Anywho there are lots of human fight scenes in hear, which comes to the point I disliked most about the movie.

GODZILLA WAS A SUB PLOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes faithful Godzilla lovers, itleast thats what it seemed like to me. Eventually the few surviving humans decide to go free Godzilla and make him follow them around and defeat all the other kaijum this is where the movie picks up.

Yes the fight scenes are incredible and although they are different they feel fresh and new. Again I won't go into details, but this movie is a let down at parts, yet it exceels at some parts. The human/alien fight scenes are neat, but they are clearly X-Men, Matrix parodies and thats not what you watch a Godzilla movie.

To sum it up Godzilla Final Wars is a very enjoyable film, which is a let down at some points and a triumph at others. It focus to much on the humans and aliens, and the whole plot in itself. And lets not forget whose 50th anniversary it is, Big G doesn't have near enough screen time. He truly is the star however and the movie exceels whenever he is on screen, and then plummets when he is absent.

I think this will sum it up better, is GFW the best Godzilla film, no it is far from it. Is it the worst G film, most certainly not. It is a very fun movie that I would highly recommend, but it is not the masterpiece of a Godzilla movie I suppose I was hoping for, falling well below King of the Monsters and G vs Destroyah, but exceeling over many. Don't go by my review though, go judge for yourself, it's more of a popcorn movie than anything else.",1137110400,,2644,4.446280991735537
2157844,5,B00061Q6VU,"When I read the mixed reviews for this film I figured I'd either love it or hate it.  Well, put me in the LOVE IT category.

This film is different from most kaiju movies because it's more of an action adventure story than a man vs. monster tale.  And there's plenty of action going on, including a great scene where five mutant commandoes take on a giant roach (Megalon in his first appearance in decades for all you fanboys out there).  There's some neat wu shu martial arts stuff, and a pretty decent story, too.

But of course, it always comes down to the monsters in a film like this.  And I think they did a terrific job of showcasing a huge cast of creatures.  True, most don't last very long against Godzilla, but that's part of the melding of genres.  Here, Godzilla is an action star and his opponents are just the minions to get in his way until he faces King Ghidora at the end.  It's worth it.  And cool to see so many familiar monsters popping up.  My personal fave is King Caesar, who is transformed into a sorta kung fu kaiju.

I guess not every Godzilla fan will like this film, so I advise renting it before deciding if you want to add it to your collection.  But for me, this is a must own.",1137024000,3,1209,4.22707423580786
2157845,3,B00061Q6VU,"If you could separate the two stories. The human vs. alien vs. monster vs. monster. Get the picture. The actual Godzilla fighting scenes were minimal. Most monsters found their arses handed to them in a matter of minutes. The movie centered mainly on the human versus alien conflict. Lots of ""thuggy"" characters fighting macho characters ... mix and match in cheap Matrix like fashion.

This could have been really good ... but sadly it fell short. I didn't hate the movie. It is worth seeing as a rental, but buying it may be to much a push. Power Rangers go!",1136937600,2,560,4.6
2157846,3,B00061Q6VU,"I agree with most viewers.  I bought the final installment of Godzilla for my collection.  I also finally found a used copy of Godzilla vs. King Kong-35th anniverary.  Although now they have re-released a low quality dub of it on DVD as dual pack on Amazon.com.  But for this particular movie, I wasn't impressed.  First, the movie really lacks the fundamental 'believability'.  Ok ok, rubber suitmation Godzilla, hello?  I understand, but beside the element of minatures and low special effects, the director always focused on making sure the good Godzilla films still faced real threats!  X people were true alien villians who disquised themselves to really capture humans.  The obvious lack of Japanese Military is a sore miss.  I like the mutant idea, but their should have been conventional Japanese jets.  It's always a part of Godzilla to see jets attacking to protect Tokyo.  And I really was dissappointed that Godzilla's son, Minilla was in this movie.  I hate that character.  I would have liked to have seen other cameo's in this movie.  Remove some monsters and maybe add that Ultraman character that was in one of the movies!",1136419200,,1139,4.9523809523809526
2157847,2,B00061Q6VU,"I love Godzilla movies.  I have since I was a kid.  I've found some of the 'Millenium' series movies to be quite entertaining.

So, when I first read about Final Wars, I was pretty geeked.  All of my favorite monsters (with the exception of Megalon) engaged in a 'Destroy All Monsters' style rampage through the cities of the world.  Sounded great.  And, it seemed like an idea that could not be screwed up.  Big guys in suits fight in detailed miniature cities.  Kids of all ages rejoice.  Pretty straight forward.

So, it was pretty darn disappointing when it was clear that the film-makers forgot the most important ingredient in a Godzilla movie...namely, monsters.  For a 2 hour long movie, it felt like the monsters (including the Big G himself) had little screen time.  Another reviewer actually added up the amount of screen time per beast and let me tell you, it felt like even less.  I do not want to see aliens in capes fighting mutants in X-men knockoff armor.  A good story and acting can work in a kaiju movie; see Godzilla: All Out Monsters Attack or any of the new Gamera films for examples.  But the film makers responsible for these movies knew that the main reason people are watching is to see guys in suits crushing model cities.  They are not tuning in to see some sub-Matrix fights and interpersonal melodrama that is both confusing and boring.

So, if you are a fan of the Big Green Guy, stay away from this movie.  Otherwise, you will be disappointed.

Oh and as a bit of a ps, I agree with all the reviewers who were critical of the score.  Godzilla films have almost always had strong scores.  Not G:FW, which had a generic techno-rock soundtrack.",1136246400,7,1674,4.569023569023569

Boy, was I disappointed to find out that during this movie that is OVER 2 HOURS all of the monsters, except for Godzilla, had an AVERAGE OF ABOUT 74.5 SECONDS OF SCREEN TIME EACH.  Godzilla HAD ONLY 12 min and 53.3 SECONDS OF SCREEN TIME. THAT IS CORRECT - 12 min and change of screen time for the title character.  As a matter of fact, here is the breakdown by monster & their screen time:

Hedorah (smog monster)- 12.5 seconds

Kumonga (giant spider) - 35.4 seconds

Gino (American Godzilla) - 35.4 seconds

King Seesar - 39.5 seconds

Manda (Giant lizard/snake thing) - 34.6 seconds

Anyway, I found this film overall quite good as Godzilla films go.  I mean come on people we arn't talking about Ocar winning cimema film here and if you are expecting this you will be better to spend you money somewhere else, but for those of us who grew up watching Godzilla and Mothra in the afternoons and on weekends this film is a real hoot.

  First of all I found the special effects greatly improved.  I especially like Rodans wings and Godzilla's ""death breath""

I found the action sequences fun and just  right for picking on as is the most fun in just about all Godzilla films.  I was also quite impressed with the nostalgic factor of seeing most major monters in one film for the first time (some I haven't seen in a while having only so far bought 8 on DVD) (SPOILER) I also got a real kick out of Mothra's sacrifice.

  On the whole this film was a hoot and ALL Godzilla fans should see it one way or another.  It would be interesting if we could all catch this on on the big screen.",1135900800,2,1157,4.180995475113122
2157850,2,B00061Q6VU,"I recently rented this video, and I was disappointed. The effects are generally really good, but there is such a clear influence of Anime on this film, as well as cheap TV shows like Power Rangers. For example, there are many scenes in which the monsters are running, and it looks like the stuff came right out of a Power Rangers battle.  Likewise, the music is very ""modern"" -- lots of electric guitar -- rather than a more traditional Godzilla score.  Worst of all, the human ""mutants"" are very much stylized to look like Anime characters, right down to their hair styles.  It was cool to see a few of the monsters in action again, but overall I didn't think this film did them justice.",1135900800,4,688,4.488
2157851,4,B00061Q6VU,My son and I love Godzilla (Yes even the American version). While this is not the best of the series it is still a great movie. Although the fight seqences are frustratingly short and Mecha-Godzilla is absent. If this is supposed to be the last movie for ten years why leave out one of Godzilla's greatest nemesis? Also absent is the Mothra larva (or baby Mothra as my son calls them).As implausible as the story line is I'm sure the could've squeezed them in. All in all not a bad movie.

This film reeks of Hollywood plagerism, assuming entire Matrix/Neo characters and scenes, albeit laughingly so. Amazingly, even Star Wars fans will recognize their favorite scenes incorporated into this mish mash of previously done Sci Fi adventures.

All of this could even have been overlooked, had only the monsters been inspired. Consider perhaps actual scenes of them more than just haphazardly spliced in, because, well, it was supposed to be a monster movie. I don't remember Godzilla even giving his signature roar until the movie's end. See G vs. Megaguirus for an example of an inspired monster movie.

2157864,3,B00061Q6VU,"Some people really have a problem with this film, but Godzilla fans are a diverse bunch and I've found every fan has a problem with some Godzilla movie. Some are charmed by ""Son of Godzilla"" or ""Godzilla Versus the Sea Monster"" and don't like Destroyer.  Some admire the original Godzilla as true classic cinema and shudder at the antics of ""Godzilla versus King Kong"". This Godzilla film borrows lots from everywhere, and is hard to classify.  Over the last 50 years we've seen just about every Godzilla imaginable, and none are right or wrong, just different film experiences.  To those that have a big problem with this movie I say 1) watch one of the 25 or so other Godzilla movies instead and 2) be thankful this was the end (for now) and that this type of Godzilla film didn't lead to another series of Godzilla films just like it!

My biggest complaint was that the film was a 50 year anniversary tribute to the Big Guy, but the film could have treated him better.  When he was on-screen he wasn't presented in an awe-inspiring fashion, with a proper sense of scale-which is the Godzilla I favor.  The monster battles definitely harken back to the late 60's or mid-70's Godzilla films, you knew they were guys in suits and not much was done to cover for it. But I suppose you could say that about ""Destroy all Monsters"" as well.

The film moves real fast and is a little heavy on the human side, especially the final kung-fu battles.  With so many monsters I would have like to see some of my old friends on-screen for a little longer.  I gave these film 3 stars as it boils down to a very average Godzilla film.

2157866,2,B00061Q6VU,"Having grown up with Godzilla, as well as many other giant monster figures, knowing that a new movie starring the Big G is always an anticipated moment. Realizing that it has been half a century since he was introduced to the world, Godzilla: Final Wars was supposed to be a major event and a blockbuster hit. When Ryuhei Kitamura was hired to direct the movie, it was thrilling to know. Unfortunately, such hopes for it to be the ultimate Godzilla movie were immediately dashed. This is clearly not the way to commemorate 50 years of a long-going series.

Final Wars excited everyone by announcing that a fairly large number of monsters from previous Godzilla films will be making a comeback. It was conceived that we were going to see some long and amazing battles, some of the most memorable yet. It's just too bad it didn't actually happen in this movie, since most of the action was concentrated away from them and on the humans instead. Many of the monsters are only onscreen for a few minutes or even less, which makes you wonder why they even bothered to feature them in the first place. The monster battles themselves are very lackluster and extremely short, and hardly anyone puts up a fight worth watching.

One good side to Final Wars are the weathering effects, while the computer-generated imagery blends quite well with the man-made backgrounds and rubber suits. However, some of the CG-created models look less convincing than the suits themselves. Despite the campiness and cheesiness, the Godzilla series have always been known for their rather beautifully sweeping orchestral scores and militaristic marches. Unfortunately, there's none of that to be found here, as the soundtrack is dominated by annoyingly implemented techno-inspired prog rock. Also, the Godzilla main theme is almost nowhere to be found. And whose idea was it to feature Sum 41 in this movie?

Final Wars also borrows noticeable elements from other movies (Star Wars, The Matrix, Predator, Mission: Impossible, and Independence Day come to mind). Godzilla always developed a cult following, so why all the pop culture references? If you're looking for great giant monster movie greatness, then look elsewhere. Everything here takes a backseat to the story between the humans and the aliens, which didn't even deserve to be focused on that much.  There was way too much emphasis on such a simplistic plot and uninteresting characters, when most of the screen time could have gone to showing more of the monsters in all their glory. The inclusion of American actors was also a questionably terrible idea. They even try to attempt comedy but fail miserably. A commemoration?

I would definitely recommend this film to any Godzilla fan.  I would suggest the film to non-Godzilla fans with the following reservations:

 - The main characters, although interesting (especially the lead alien), are somewhat two dimensional

 - The plot weakens as the film progresses

 - The monsters are cheesy (On purpose)

 - The film is a bit long

 - The ending is somewhat silly

 - The American actors are awful

 - There are a few scenes that may disturb small children

  The Gotengo (a ship basicaly) shoots missiles at a glacier in the North Pole and buries Godzilla. Later, tons of monsters attack the world. And, as soon as the monsters come the monsters dissapear. It is soon discovered that aliens called the xilians have saved the world from the monsters.

  Now, if you're a Godzilla fan, you would probably guess that the aliens are not sincere. If you guessed that... You're right! Soon. the xiliens release all the monsters on to the world again. The monsters completely destroy the world. Some survivers take the Gotengo and decide that in order to kill the monsters, they have to unleash ...GODZILLA!!!!!! When they arrive, Gigan (a bird cyborg) attacks the Gotengo.

  But, not before the Gotengo fires missiles at the glacier that buried Godzilla. Godzilla awakens and kills Gigan. Then, he follows the Gotengo to where the other monsters are. Godzilla battles Zilla (a giant iguana), Rodan (a pterodactyll), Anguirus  (ankylosaurus) King Caeser (a giant lion), Kumonga (a giant spider), Hedorah (the slog monster), and Ebirah (a giant lobster).

  Godzilla finally arrives at the mothership, kills all the xilien and along with Gigan II, and Monster X/Kaiser Ghidorah. At the very end, Godzilla swims away with Minilla (Godzilla's son(, showing that the Godzilla saga will never end.

I've read reviews of the film on the internet for the last year while I waited for the U.S. DVD release.  It's safe to say that based on these reviews my anticipation declined and my expectations were lowered.  I can sum up my reaction to these 'reviewers' in four words, having seen the movie for myself...""They were all wrong"".

Final Wars has everything that a Godzilla fan is looking for:  monsters galore, just enough human drama(not much as usual, but just enough) to ground the story, and plenty of kaiju fighting. There is some criticism of how quick some of the fights are.  They are missing the point: we need to establish that Godzilla is truly ""king of the monsters"" or he can never defeat the final alien opponent.

Another criticism...there are homages to the Matrix and Star Wars...etc.  Who cares?  I sense them to but they are not forced into the plot nor do they detract from the story...they advance it.  There a bits of Japanese film imagery in George Lucas' movies, why can't it work the other way around?

If you go into this movie understanding what a true Godzilla flick is...plenty of monsters, cheezy dialog and human catastrophe...you will not be let down.  This movie had more monster action than many G-films put together, and it was spiced up by some quality human fighing as well.  Speaking of humans, the characters were interesting and likeable.  The head villain's tantrums are fantastic...we need to establish that the enemy is insane and dangerous.

I am so glad that this movie emerges from the rubble of poorly conceived criticism and fires an energy blast that obliterates the doubters.

If you still have that childhood spirit in you, the one that grew up knowing what a Godzilla film was and what you could expect, you are in for the best ride yet.

Buy this movie...don't let the overly serious critics deny you a great time!  You are going to have a blast...trust me.",1135382400,8,2003,4.69054441260745

VIDEO: AVERAGE

Blurry is the first thing that comes to mind. It isn't so much a problem when Godzilla is on the screen, but any time there are people (or aliens), it is immediately obvious.

Another problem is that during dark scenes, there is a LOT of grain and even some artifacts. It is quite watchable, but you shouldnt be expecting much when you put this disc in.

AUDIO: AVERAGE

The included ""Japanese"" (I'll explain the quotes later) 5.1 track doesnt sound very good, and is sometimes even confusing. Effects are spread around like butter on toast, like the mixer wanted to use every channel regardless of whether or not it was appropriate. I actually switched my receiver over to stereo for the second half of the movie and found it to be better (as in: no longer distracting).

Bass seems to be great in some places and nonexistant in others -one of the latter is part of the biggest explosion in the movie, totally neutered by the almost complete lack of bass.

I did not try the English 5.1 track.

FEATURES: POOR

Aside from some previews (that are played before the disc menu loads anyway, Joy!), there is a ""behind the scenes"" of some godzilla fights. It can be interesting to some to see how the fights are made and then see the end result, but if you have any of the other Sony-released Godzilla movies on DVD, then you've seen it all before. Those are all the ""Special Features"".

Also, I find animated and ""fancy"" DVD menus to be annoying, but it is a decent judge of how seriously a publisher takes a particular DVD. In this case, you get an ugly static image and no music. If there were no ""Special Features"", then I suspect they would have gotten rid of the menu altogether.

ANNOYANCES:

-As most know, the twins on Orphan Island speak the same words at the same time. When english subtitles are enabled, there are subtitles for each twin. Of course the subtitles say the exact same thing. It is technically correct, since there are two people speaking, but it is just stupid. They don't say anything separately or differently. Annoying.

-The ""Japanese"" track is edited. They dubbed out some swear words that were spoken in english. This isn't really a big deal in that it doesnt affect anything, but it is just annoying that this sort of stuff keeps happening. After respectable releases from Sony in the past few years, are we going back to ""Edited for Americans"" R1 Godzilla DVDs, or is this just a ""Godzilla is for kids, so lets take out the swearing"" edit? Dissapointing, either way.

OVERALL...

this is a very dissapointing release. For what is supposed to be ""the last Godzilla for the next 20 years"" (yeah, right), they released one of their worst Godzilla DVDs.

With no features that are special, a crappy video transfer, a chaotic 5.1 Japanese audio track, and some stupid subbing and kidding-down problems, all we can do is hope that they're just messing with us and will release a real DVD (2-disc with some real extras?) after everyone has bought this one up. Unfortunately this is about the only option anyone has, because the Japanese DVD has no English subtitles, this is the only non-bootleg Godzilla Final Wars DVD that has English subs.",1135296000,3,3329,4.6552901023890785
2157881,3,B00061Q6VU,"I read alot of the other reviews of this movie and wasn't really sure what to expect. Some said it was the worst G flick ever, others say it was the best. I say it is neither.

The Good:

1.) The opening credits intro for this film is awesome, absolutely awesome.

2.) The special effects at times are quite good, though even more out of reality than even previous G flicks.

3.) I like the Russian(assuming he's Russian) captain, I know he's a Sergeant Slaughter ripoff but I think he's cool.

4.) They build the suspense up a bit(though nowhere near enough) to Godzilla's final fights.

5.) We get to see older Godzilla monsters updated which is kinda cool, although King Seesar looks like he's a deer caught in the headlights.

6.) Gigan does look way cool.

The Bad:

1.) Godzilla is MIA for more than 60% of the film, this I found rather disappointing.

2.) The Japanese actors don't do a very good job, they must have been underpaid or something.

3.) The fights Godzilla does have are way, way, way too short.

4.) The special effects go from being really good to really bad in a heartbeat.

5.) Way too much Matrix influence in the film to the point that it's sickening. A decent amount would have been ok, but it's just way too much.

6.) The plot is predictable even for a G flick.

The DVD is very good, with the widescreen edition of the film with both English and Japanese audio tracks. Special features are worth the money with the making of the scenes worth it's weight in gold.

If you are a G fan fanatic, you have to have this film, period.

If you like Godzilla but you liked the Matrix as much if not more, you might like this film.

If you like lots of Kaiju fighting, this film might not be for you as you won't be satisfied by it.

If you're not sure, rent it, then decide. I definitely bought it, I'm not regretting it either as I'm a fanatic.",1135209600,2,1867,4.313218390804598

The plot is ridiculous and way too much time is spent with the humans vs. aliens story line. In fact, Godzilla and company is mostly a sub plot. For the most part the battle scenes are brief and unrewarding, and no more then three monsters make an appearence in any one scene. No great multi-monster shots like in ""Destroy all Monsters"".  I barely made it through this film. I would rather watch the American version of Godzilla again than this movie. A pathetic end to the big G's legacy.

2157885,5,B00061Q6VU,"There is too much to be said about this movie and I don't want to write an ultra-long review, so I'll do my best to give a rough description of what to expect from this movie, and the reader can decide for himself if he thinks this movie is worth seeing.

This Godzilla film is very different from all the other Godzilla films. This is the only Godzilla film directed by Ryuhei Kitamura. Unlike previous Godzilla films, the ""human"" scenes also feature heavy-duty fighting/action sequences, sort of like the Matrix Trilogy, or some Hong Kong Martial Arts flicks. The film's original music and overall style are consistent with that feel as well.

In terms of the length of the monster fighting footage contained in this movie, it is above average for a Godzilla movie, but not tremendously so. There are many monsters (about 16) but most die quickly. In the end, this movie ends up being ""Godzilla vs King Ghidorah, Part 7"" so it's not a complete Battle Royale monsterfest. But it's still a respectable monsterfest, and lots of fun for fans of Godzilla. The fight choreography and style is fairly unique as well. The monsters move faster than in most other Godzilla movies. Some even do karate. They don't move as fast or cheesily as some of the Godzilla movies of the 70's (those were a lot of fun, I was a fan of that style myself) but it is close. There are also some interesting scenes preceding the final fight between Godzilla and Ghidorah that totally rip off from Dragon Ball Z which I thought were really cool.

This movie sort of works as a tribute to the old Godzilla movies of the 60's I think, so there are some really campy things in it like cheesily-dressed aliens and mutants. But it's funny, and done on purpose. The aliens look sort of cool and cheesy at the same time, and the same goes for their spazzy leader. If you don't mind a bit of silliness in your shows you'll probably like this movie. But the style isn't for everyone, and some viewers will be turned off by the idiocy and straight-forwardness of the plot. Godzilla Final Wars is almost like a parody of the earlier Godzilla movies, it is so silly at times.

A friend of mine commented that Godzilla Final Wars feels like it was intended for little kids. I don't totally agree with that, but I'll agree that being able to enjoy a fairly mindless silly show is a requirement to enjoying this show. However, if you do like this type of show, this movie is amazing and will be a lot of fun.

There's also a trailer for Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children on this DVD. That was an unexpected bonus, too.",1134950400,2,2577,4.509635974304069
2157886,1,B00061Q6VU,"This remarkably lame entry into the Godzilla franchise apparently marks the end of the second run of movies, and it slams the door shut with a resounding thud.  The last several movies were excellent, particularly Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack, which marked the return of the evil, scary Godzilla.  Final Wars is a lame pastiche of The Matix and X-Men, framed with relatively stingy Kaiju battle scenes.  While the idea of the Kaiju Godzilla facing down his digital American alter ego is amusing, the actual execution was amateurish.  All in all, too little of Tokyo being destroyed by giant monsters and too much moody expository dialog by sullen mutants.

Let's hope they re-charge with some more fun movies next cycle.",1134950400,8,754,5.097560975609756
2157887,4,B00061Q6VU,um...this isn't going to be about the Godzilla Final Wars movie but more about the future of the big G.  I'm seeing a lot of reviews about this movie compaired to the past Godzilla movies.  I'm wondering how this movie rates next to that stupid Americanized version that the ID guys did.  If this should be the last Godzilla movie that Toho puts out I'd really liek to see another go by someone here in the states...now hear me out on this one.  I just went to see the new King Kong movie the other day and I have to say that you can see the love Peter Jackson had for the character.  While a Peter Jackson 3 hr Godzilla movie shall only be a dream of mine I figure there has got to be someone in Hollywood that could make a Godzilla movie with the same care that mr. Jackson put into Kong. I really don't see why they couldn't make an American Godzilla movie using the same Godzilla that they use in Japan except use CGI instead of a man in a suit. I recall years ago a rumor of Spielberg talking about a Godzilla movie....instead we got the garbage that was put out under the name of Godzilla by someone else and Mr. Spielberg is making Transformers.  There have been a lot of Japanese movies remade in America over the past couple of years that have done pretty well so maybe it's time for the Big G to get a second chance over here.,1134864000,,1336,4.178988326848249
2157888,4,B00061Q6VU,"After viewing a portion of Big G's allegedly 'last movie,' I do agree with some reviewers' critics on the campy, cheesy, silliness of the brief monster battles with Godzilla's allies and enemies. There are some CGI explosion effects super-imposed on Godzilla and miniture model vehicles that made the battle scenes look less authentic to the previous movies. (That's why I gave a 4 star rating!)

Before ""Final Wars"" was released in a theater in L.A., director Ryuhei Kitamura and Masahiro Matsuoka, promoted this movie at Godzillafest in San Francisco's Castro Theater. Ryuhei was overwhelmed by the lengthy period of time Godzilla has been around since 1954. Although he said, ""I have not seen any of the older Godzilla movies from the 60's and 70's. And if I did, I would have hated them."" Yet his movie pays tribute to Godzilla for 50 years next to the recent and older films;  ""Giant Monsters Attack, Godzilla 2000, Godzilla v.s. Destroyer, Godzilla v.s. MechaGodzilla I & II, Destroy All Monsters, Son of Godzilla, Godzilla v.s. Gigan, Godzilla v.s. Monster Zero, Godzilla v.s. Megalon, Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster, Godzilla v.s. Mothra, Godzilla Raids Again, and of course, Godzilla King of the Monsters.

Based on what I've seen, Ryuhei jammed and condensed ideas from the Matrix Trilogy, ID4, X-Men, Atrogon, Ultraman, and a few Japanese shock films together, to supposedly be, an all-out Godzilla action flick that became action waaaaaaay overkilled in the fights and motorcycle chase scenes. Whatever happened to the story and drama that made most of the previous films successful? Hopefully, this will be Ryuhei's first and only Godzilla film and allow other Japanese filmmakers have new ideas for future Godzilla films in the works. (I have yet to see Azumi and Versus.)

If you DO enjoy watching grown men beat each other up in rubber suits, then by all means BUY this film.

This is the EPIC all time WINNER when it comes to Monster Bashes.

So many other Monsters from previous films show up and it pretty much becomes the Monster Movie equivelent of a High School Reunion. I don't usually like Godzilla films, like Porn, after about ten minutes you've pretty much seen all that they can do.

The main problem with these films is that there is really no reason for the humans to be a part of the story. The real story is always between Godzilla and Insert Monster Name Here.

That said, it would have been fun to see this on the big screen with an audience. But Hollywood does not seem to understand that folks like stuff as silly as this along with the Oscar bait films.

But I just finished watching the DVD... and I must say... I was not impressed with this film. The newer films feel less and less like Godzilla films and more like films with Godzilla as an afterthought. I was disappointed to see the Big G head out with such a film.

If you're looking for a good film, you should buy this movie. If you're looking for a great send-off movie for Godzilla, DO NOT BUY this movie.

  GFW was an OK film, but I think it could have been better. Being a life, long Godzilla fan (I have all 28 G-movies) it was real great to see all of the older Godzilla foes back on the screen, but their screen times were too short to truly appreciate (especially the Hedorah scene). It was also great to see Toho legends Akira Takarada (from the first Godzilla 1954 film) and Kenji Sahara. I like the way the film seemed to play homage to past films like the ""Atragon-like"" sub-ship encounter with Manda (from ""Atragon"") and even a tribute to Kitamura's own movie ""Versus"" when actor Don Frye (who looks like Jesse Ventura) holds the samurai sword over his back, but I think most people interpreted the majority of the movie as popular film ""rip-offs"" of the recent ""Matrix"" movies. The villain aliens & heroes are dressed in black leather coats and dark sunglasses, off the wall martial arts fights complete with ""Matrix-trademark"" rotating camera angles and there is even a scene when one of the mutant heroes (actor Masahiro Matsuoka) stops several laser shots like Keana Reeves did with bullets.  You could also see elements of ""Return of the Jedi"" and ""Independence Day"" during the Atragon ship's final assault on the mother ship.
  The film is generally OK and the monster fights (although short and few between) were entertaining to watch. The killing of the Tristar ""Zilla"" was a pleasurable sight to see (there's only one King of the monsters!). I sensed a short tribute to Raymond Chow's ""Shaolin Soccer"" during the Angilas kick ball fight between Godzilla, Rodan & King Ceasar.  Again like in many other past Godzilla films there is an alien race with a sinister plan against good-old Earth with all of the monsters involved. It sounds like a plot repeated many times before (""Destroy all Monsters"", ""G vs. Monster Zero"" & ""G vs. Gigan""), but how may times can you re-invent the Godzilla story that has already been done 27 times?
  As far as the DVD concerned it's another great quality product of G-films by Sony pictures. The special effects b-roll in the special features is basically the same as the one featured in the ""Godzilla Tokyo SOS"" DVD. Despite what the Amazon features advertise above, I could not find any trailer for GFW, just the same Godzilla compilation trailer featured on past Sony Godzilla DVD's.
  I appreciate Kitamura's effort for putting his own special flavor in a long, historical list of Godzilla directors who created the longest, running movie franchise in history (gotta stay ahead of James Bond right?). If this is truly the last Godzilla film (I'm still waiting for a Godzilla vs. Gamera movie) let's just savor it for now until the hopeful moment when we hear that all too familiar roar again.",1134604800,2,2925,5.0602910602910605
2157896,4,B00061Q6VU,"Godzilla Final Wars is FAR from perfect. I, perhaps the biggest Godzilla fan from where I live, am the first to admit it. However, I AM willing to give this movie such a high rating because it's just pure FUN! All these G-fans who give it a low rating because the acting, sfx, and kaiju fighting time are low need to take a deep breath and let it go. What's done is done. Kitamura made a very UNIQUE Godzilla movie, adding his own stamp to the series that, frankly, was getting tired and worn out. Tokyo SOS, this movie's predecessor, was an excellent movie, but it appeals mostly to us diehard fans and wouldn't be too interesting to the casual view. Plus, it had nothing highly original in terms of fighting and spfx. There are a few highlights, but nothing innovative. With GFW, we get a fresh outlook by a Toho outsider, and tons of elements that have never been tried before.

I liked the story as a throwback to the epics of Toho's Golden Era of the '60s, when alien invasions with monsters were commonplace. And yes, the characters are pretty much one-dimensional but there's no much happening here that we don't have the time to go in-depth.

The action is fresh and vivid...I really didn't mind the Matrix ""rip-offs"" because they fit for this type of movie. If GMK were to have this type of action, then I'd be complaining. GFW is already so far out that it just seems to go along with it. Plus, it was a relief to finally CARE about what was going on with the humans, rather than just having them stand off to the side and stare and react stupidly to the battle in front of them. At least here we get action on both fronts, and they somewhat interlock storywise. For the most part, the human fighting is on par with most action movies like The Matrix or any other Hong Kong flick.

The monster fights, too, are fresh for this time period in that they are a throwback to the '70s. Kitamura has said that his favorite Godzilla movie is ""Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla"" (the 1974 version), so don't expect the fights to be slow paced. And while I'm a little disappointed most of the battles are short, at the same time I'm glad because 6 10-minute battles would have been overkill, not to mention boring (c'mon, how many moves does Godzilla have up his sleeve? Not many, folks!) Each battle also has a small gag to keep us interested, be it his flinging Kumonga over the horizon or playing Anguirus soccer with King Seesar. It made me care about this Godzilla as an actual character in the story: he has an almost human personality, something that we can identify ourselves with.

SFX are mostly good, with a few cringe moments, but then again every Godzilla movie does. Plus, it's good that they were about the same as the previous adventures because despite the ""increased budget"" this was still the fastest-produced G-Film since Megalon, and most of the money went towards the location shoots. As such, Eiichi Asada does a fantastic job with the resources he is given and, for the most part, delivers.

In conclusion, GFW is not the quintessential G-Film, but it is a good celebration of the history of our favorite monster. It's essentially a 70's G-film modernized and mashed together with everything but the kitchen sink. It has it's bad parts (particularly those involving Minilla...good effort, but alas I'm not converted from the anti-Minilla front), it's weak in many places, but it is just pure plain fun.

2157897,2,B00061Q6VU,"The Earth is doomed when a bunch of metrosexual aliens in bondage come to enslave the planet and use humans for food. They managed to alter the DNA of the monsters and are using them to destroy the civilations of the world. What they did not account for was Godzilla, Mothra and the resistance led by someone that looks like Stalin. About 90% of the movie deals with the aliens and the mutant human resistance and how one of the main characters is a super being (Neo); don't ask me to explain it because it really makes no sense nor does it matter. The alien part of the movie is essentially a rip-off of the Matrix, right down to the fighting scense, and also a bunch of other popular American movies. The music score is horrible. Where is Godzilla's theme?

The final battle between Godzilla and Monster X is OK, but very brief. Godzilla also makes short work of the fake Godzilla that was in the US movie. This is why I gave it 2 stars instead of one (because I can't give it 0 it seems).

The world is left in ruin, as the Metrosexuals are defeatd and Godzilla stands alone after defeating all of the monsters. Thankfully, Milla, the Son of Godzilla convinces him not to kill Stalin and Neo and the rest of the team and everyone lives happily ever after.

Of the modern Godzilla films, this is the worst one by far. A shame really, because they have been getting pretty good. I don't know if it really should have been called a Godzilla movie because very little of it actually has to do with the monster at all. Nearly two hours of it is all about the aliens. This film could be condensed into about 15-20mins, which would include all of the monster battles and remove the Matrix story line.

Just to note, I am a die hard Godzilla fan, I own all of the movies and have seen them numerous times. I wanted to really enjoy this film, but unfortunately, it is simply awful.

2157909,5,B00061Q6VU,"I have to say that Godzilla: Final Wars is the best movie out of the Millennium series, at least in my opinion. I loved how they used the Xillians from Godzilla vs. Monster Zero and knocked up their coolness factor up a lot. There was so much action in this movie that the parts that didn't have any kaiju in it could have been used for a separate movie and still would have been just as cool. They have many action scenes between the humans that keep this movie very entertaining. Mainly when the main hero is fighting his friend who was brainwashed and they are fighting while riding motorcycles. That action sequence is fantastic. A lot of the story is.

X, the main Villain of the film, is probably the coolest villain I have seen on a Godzilla film. He just has this evil sneer about his face that makes him seem diabolical yet cool at the same time. I didn't watch the movie in sub-title, but in dub so I don't know if it would be the same, but the dubbed voice of X really fit with the character, I especially enjoyed his laugh. Frye, the American in this film, did a great job in it as well. It was nice to see an American once again in a Godzilla film that is actually supposed to be in it and not just added for the American version.

The music of the film also was some of the best I have heard. Everything about the music in this film fit the scenes they were put into.

The monsters fights themselves were pretty good, but short. The only problem I had with the fights that Godzilla had was that they were too short, some fights only lasting maybe thirty seconds. But who's to argue, this movie featured 15 different monsters, even the American Godzilla labeled as just Zilla on the DVD box. Even Minya returned in this film. He pretty much acts the way he usually does, but he isn't much in the film so the Minya haters shouldn't be too upset about his presence in this movie.

It's overall a great movie to end the Millennium series. From the awesomely cool opening credits that pay homage to all of the previous movies throughout the years to the end credits, it's all fantastic and I really do enjoy the film.",1134172800,2,2126,4.3075
2157910,4,B00061Q6VU,"Godzilla Final Wars is the purported send-off for the granddaddy of all Japanese giant monsters.  Toho plans on retiring the Big G for the next 10 to 15 years in hopes of generating interest in Gojira as his latest cinematic forays have not been very financially rewarding. I originally saw this film on DVD via the Region 2 release.  Sure what one may see as Kitamura paying homage to various Hollywood blockbusters can also be construed as plagiarism, but he delivers a very solid entertaining ride for two hours.  Kitamura's biggest problem, as any of his casual fans are certainly aware of, is his pacing and editing.  Films that should be no longer than 90 minutes (Alive, Sky High, Versus) are stretched beyond the two hour mark.  Godzilla Final Wars manages to sustain the pace and is never boring.  For Godzilla fans it certainly is a love letter to previous incarnations.  Plus, Kitamura even was kind enough to add the American Godzilla, therefore ensuring its place in the Japanese continuity of films.  Some viewers may be surprised at how little Godzilla is featured in the film.  However, holding back on screen time does create tension and anticipation, so when Godzilla does finally enter into the action it is very satisfying.  Again, this may not be one of the best Godzilla films ever (I reserve that title for the original 1954 film, Godzilla Vs. Hedorah, Godzilla Vs. Mechagodzilla II, and GMK) but it is fun.  It definitely ranks as one of Kitamura's highlights (along with Azumi and his short film The Messenger).  I recommend anyone interested to give the film at least a rental.

The absence of any attempt to create an emotional connection between the audience and what's going on on-screen?  The way that fight scenes just stop, without any kind of conclusion?

As a long-time ""Gojira"" affectionado let me say that it is a fitting culmination of the Godzilla saga, as director Kitamura captures as much of the movie series' spirit in one gigantic extravaganza. Reviewer N.Verboon stated it most accurately in his October 8 opinion concerning the essence of the film. This movie is not meant to be a focus of a titanic battle between Godzilla and an arch-nemesis, but rather a celebration of the various metamorpheses our favorite big guy has taken in his 50 year cinematographic career. This results in some rather hectic storylines at certain points of the movie but when it is over and you have a chance to digest all of the overt and subtle allegories you find yourself examining Godzilla's career as a whole, which I feel is the purpose behind Kitamura's work. When you view this film enjoy it for what it is, a fun-filled, action-packed Battle Royale with the King of Monsters getting the final roar over his most famous rivals.",1132963200,4,1049,4.706521739130435

On a postive note, this IS one of the most ambitious Godzilla movies ever made.  You can tell the producers really wanted to make a good movie.  The only real problem is that they steer way to far off the original formula that made the Godzilla films work.

2157916,2,B00061Q6VU,"If you're a Godzilla fan, you're going to get this. Of course you're going to get this. It's easily the most anticipated G-film in years. So I'm not even going to try to stop you from getting it. But, you'll enjoy it a lot more if you just lower your expectations. Despite the hype being thrown on it here, it is not ""OHMIGHOD IS TEH GREATEST GODZILLA MOVIE EVER"". It's not even a good movie by any standards, and those who rate it with a ""5"" apparently have very low standards. It doesn't even work as ""so bad it's good"". The film shows little or no respect to Godzilla or the kaiju eiga genre in general, and was certainly no way to ""celebrate"" or pay homage to the 50th anniversary.

But get together with a bunch of friends and a bunch of beers, kick back, and apply a MST3K audience participation experience to it, and groan your way through the fun. If laughing at Godzilla, hack directing and bad acting is your thing, then GODZILLA FINAL WARS is the film for you.

SPOILERS FOLLOW

The special effects in some ways manage to illustrate the problems with the entire movie. They ranged from a very few that were breathtaking and new, to pathetic. More often than not, the awful effects were the result of poor CG or clumsy compositing. This is not new to the Godzilla film, of course, but the sheer amount of overly-ambitious and poorly executed effects left me wondering, 'If you didn't have the time, money or skill to do it, then why do it?'

The acting is almost uniformly mediocre and unconvincing, even from Toho veterans such as Akira Takarada as U.N. Secretary General Daigo and Kumi Mizuno as EDF Commander Namikawa. Kazuki Kitamura as the evil Xilien Commander easily turns in the best (if not over-the-top) performance, and delivers the best line in the movie (which is COMPLETELY BLOWN in the English dub!!!!).

The biggest weakness other than the lazy direction is the story itself. Whether one takes the approach to film that a story should follow a traditional structure of introduction, protagonist, conflict, resolution, etc., or that the rules can be broken to tell a story in a more compelling fashion, GFW fails either way. The story simply throws too many components into what could have been a rather straightforward story. Elements and ideas are introduced, often out of the blue without reasonable explanation, and sometimes abandoned for no reason at all. Challenges arise, and are conveniently resolved via deus ex machina.

And how many unoriginal ideas can Kitamura and co-writer Isao Kiriyama introduce into a single movie? Quite a few apparently. The entire MATRIX TRILOGY is covered quite well in GFW, both in terms of visuals and what passes for character development. Ozaki is roughly the equivalent of Neo. The 'Burly Brawl' of MATRIX RELOADED is duplicated in 'lite' form as Kumasaka (Masakatsu Funaki) takes on the converted M-force. Similarities to INDEPENDENCE DAY, ALIENS, and X-MEN are obvious, but nothing can prepare you for the horror of the 'tribute' to RETURN OF THE JEDI when Kazama (Caine Kosugi) makes his final run on the Death Star. These moments were not taking something familiar and giving them an original twist, nor even paying homage. It was copy and paste laziness.

The score by Keith Emerson is, like everything else, all over the place. It often sounds like cheap synth music from a CASIO or straight-to-video films of the eighties. Fortunately, I could console myself that the film opened briefly with Godzilla's theme from KING KONG VS GODZILLA (over an old 'Tohoscope' banner no less!), and cues from Masaru Satoh's SON OF GODZILLA (Minilla's theme) and GODZILLA VS MECHAGODZILLA make brief, if strange, appearances.

'But wait,' you are probably saying to yourself at this point. 'This is a Godzilla film. Stop talking about your CITIZEN KANE scale expectations, and tell me about the monsters!' Of course. After all, it's not unprecedented for a Godzilla film to fail on one or more of the above counts (MEGALON and GIGAN come to mind). I was thrilled at the opening sequence with the original Goten and Godzilla. Favorites such as Manda, Gigan and Anguirus are certainly seen as never before, and the scene with the EDF battling Ebirah was great. The initial invasions of the kaiju are generally well-executed, albeit brief. And that's my problem with all of the monster action: it is so very short, and beyond the first 20 minutes, it is poorly integrated into the rest of the story. Although the concept of ""the King of Monsters, so powerful he takes out enemies with one punch"", may sound good on paper, it leaves a lot to be desired when it actually happens within seconds. Even the final battle is anti-climactic, and falls victim to yet another out-of-the-blue plot device that left this viewer feeling cheated.

In the end, this is a movie that you will see no matter what I nor anybody else says. I only hope that you someday get to see it on the big screen with a house full of fans, because that at least takes some of the edge off. Sitting at home alone and watching it on DVD will likely be an empty experience.",1131148800,37,5095,4.761041902604757
2157917,5,B00061Q6VU,"My wife and I couldn't wait for this to come out in the US, so we got the Japanese version with English subtitles... and...

THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!!!!!

It's got it all: Evil space aliens bent conquering the Earth, lots of excellent kaiju battles, a young couple who can't stand each other when they meet but you know they're meant for each other, mutant kung-fu on motorcycles, Anguirus trashing Shanghai, an American soldier whose demeanor and attitude is a match for Godzilla, cheesy science, big explosions, an oil refinery going up in flames, the twin fairies from Infant Island, and the most powerful kaiju opponent Godzilla has ever faced!

This movie was clearly made by people who deeply love the Showa series (1954 though late 70s) Godzilla movies and related Toho kaiju movies of that era. Almost all of our old friends from that period show up (the major exceptions being Megalon and Mechagodzilla), including some little-known kaiju such as Manda and Ebirah. And many important characters and plot points turn out to hark back to those movies.

GFW also reminds me of Twin Peaks, in that it's packed full of media and cultural references. Many are to Showa-era Godzilla movies - and not just the Japanese versions, but the English dubs. For instance, in one scene in the Japanese version, two guys are sitting there, and one notices something and says, ""Glenn! Glenn!"" in English to his buddy, in exactly the same way Fuji said it to Glenn in the English dub of ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"". You can also play ""recognize the actor"", since the actors for many of the major and minor characters appeared in various Godzilla movies from the 60s to the present.

It would be great to see this in a movie theater. And if Toho really is going to give the Godzilla movies a few years' break, this is a terrific movie to go out on.",1130630400,7,1832,4.694704049844237

The key to enjoy it is not taking the movie seriously. The action sequences are truly exagerated with the human-alien interaction, and the things really screw up with the monsters interventions. The funniest part for me was the Fight between Godzilla, ROdan, Anguirus and King Seesar. I won't spoil you telling everything about that moment, because it's worth to see get a good laugh.

My favorite part of the film is GINO's (Zilla in FW) demise. The monster everyone loves to hate makes his first appearance early in the film as monsters begin to ravage the globe. GINO (Godzilla In Name Only for those unaware of the anagram) is shown crashing through the streets of Sydney and causes more destruction in about a minute then it did in New York (one of the reasons the US Godzilla film failed). Later on when East meets West GINO is dispatched quickly with a tail whip and a blast of fire from ""The Real Godzilla"" much to everyone's delight.

The film once again establishes Godzilla as ""The King of the Monsters"" which is where he belongs.

2157933,1,B00061Q6VU,"Such a sad end to a once great series of colourful, entertaining films. In the past, even the worst of the Godzilla pictures somehow managed to be fun. That's not the case here. GFW is a uninspired mess of bad acting, immature writing, sloppy editing and uneven special effects.

Final Wars may have a lot of idea's but it sorely lacked in common sense, intelligence and spirit. What we have is a film as empty as movies such as the 1998 US Godzilla film. It shamelessly rips off idea's from the Matrix, Kill Bill and ID4. Kitamura characters are as pretentious and trendy as ever. Apparently a trademark of his.

On the plus side, we do get to see some fun monster battles. Most only last for less than a minute but there are two main battles that shine. The first being a crazy soccer ball parody battle between Godzilla, Angilas, King Ceasar and Rodan. The second and final main battle was hilariously bad but in a fun Godzilla Vs. Megalon sort of way. This one included Godzilla, Mothra, Gigan and Monster X (who eventually transformed into Kaiser Ghidorah). Very cheesy with Monster X looking like a bad Power Ranger monster. Kaiser Ghidorah is just awful. One of Toho's worse creations.

Final Wars worst crime was that this was the movie made to celebrate the 50 years of Godzilla's existence. Kitamura clearly never understood why the series has lasted so long and obviously had no interest in knowing the reason. In the end we have a pale imitation of the Matrix and ID4 with monsters occasionally showing up. Not a very good way to pay tribute to the character or the series. Even when there was a nod to Godzilla's past it was misguided. Instead of focusing on what made Godzilla a great icon, Kitamura centered on what almost killed him off in the mid 70's. Ironically, considering this film had a horrible box office and lost tons of money, I'm sure this is certainly the end.

Sayonara Godzilla. You will be remembered. But not for your final movie.",1129334400,20,1963,4.616045845272207
2157934,5,B00061Q6VU,"In 1954, Toho created a one shot Kaiju movie featuring a monster by the name of Gojira/Godzilla. ""Gojira"" turned out to be a huge success and thus multiple sequels were created. In 1975, Toho put Godzilla to rest when the series started to dwindle in popularity. They brought the series back in 1984 with ""Godzilla 1984,"" which was a direct sequel to the original movie, and omitted everything that happened between ""Godzilla Raids Again"" through ""Terror of MechaGodzilla."" This new era was given the title of the Heisei series, and lasted until 1995 when Toho ended the series once again with ""Godzilla vs. Destoroyah.""

Godzilla was once again brought back to life in 1999 with the first movie in the Millennium saga, ""Godzilla 2000 Millennium."" Each movie in the series did not feature any continuity between the two sans ""Godzilla x MechaGodzilla"" and ""Godzilla x Mothra x MechaGodzilla Tokyo S.O.S."" Finally, for the fiftieth anniversary in 2004, Toho decided their new movie would once again be the final one for the next five to ten years. They hired Ryuhei Kitamura, currently one of Japan's most popular directors, to do the ""final"" movie, which has been called ""Godzilla Final Wars.""

""Godzilla Final Wars"" features various monsters from the entire series of movies, even the American Godzilla that Sony created in 1998. Some of the monsters like Mothra and Ghidorah have been seen in every series of movies, while others, such as Gigan, Hedorah, Ebirah, and Minilla have not been seen since the Showa era. These six monsters, among many others, have been brought back to give a grand celebration to the king of the monsters' anniversary.

Toho has stated that ""Godzilla Final Wars"" is the final Godzilla movie for the next five to ten years. Question is, is the movie worthy of being the final Godzilla movie for now? The answer is yes and no. As an action movie, Kitamura did a wonderful job making it an interesting and great looking film worthy of being the final movie. As a Godzilla movie though, it is pretty weak and it is not worthy in being the end to the franchise.

First off, the human characters take up most of the screen time in the movie, and most of the plot. In fact, out of the entire two hours, they have at least a good hour and a half of it, maybe more. While sometimes the humans have had most of the screen time back in the Showa era, the plot revolved around the monsters though. This movie on the other hand could have done without the monsters and would have been a great action movie on its own. It seems like Kitamura had a movie with this idea in mind, but when he was asked to do the ""last"" Godzilla movie, he took his movie's plot and just added the monster's to it.

One of the really interesting things in the human department though is the fact that Toho brought in quite a few actors from previous Godzilla movies. Naotar Daigo, the UN Secretary General, was played by Akira Takarada, who played Fuji in ""Godzilla vs. Monster Zero"" and Yoshimura in ""Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster."" Then you have the Kumi Mizuno as the EDF commander Akiko Namikawa, who also played in ""Godzilla vs. The Sea Monster"" as Daiyo and ""Godzilla x MechaGodzilla"" as the Prime Minister in 1999. Masat Ibu, from ""Godzilla x Megaguirus,"" played the first X-Seijin Commander. Then you have the man who has been in every Godzilla movie since ""Godzilla vs. Biollante,"" Kichi Ueda. Finally, Akira Nakao played the Gotengo commander in the beginning of the movie. Akira played the second Prime Minister in ""Godzilla x MechaGodzilla"" and ""Godzilla x Mothra x MechaGodzilla: Tokyo S.O.S."" He also starred in the last three movies of the Heisei era. Kazuki Kitamura plays the second X-Seijin commander, and he pulls off a really wonderful psychotic villain. It is also worth noting that Kazama's actor, Kane Kosugi, played the black ranger in ""Ninja Sentai KakuRanger.""

Douglas Gordon was played by an actor named Don Frye, who had an interesting role in this movie. Frye did not speak one word of Japanese at all during the movie. A character would talk to him in Japanese, and then he would just reply back in English (with Japanese subtitles). Sometimes another character would say something to him in English, but ninety percent of the time it was just in Japanese. This made some conversations quite interesting, especially when he said he wanted to free Godzilla from his prison, and the Japanese commander frantically replied in Japanese, and then Frye said something like, ""Yes, I know, but there isn't a world left for him to destroy.""

Unfortunately, for the humans having so much screen time, there is hardly any character development between them at all. Their scenes are constantly cut from one to another without a second thought. The only development actually given is with Gordon with his mention of being on the Gotengo when they first buried Godzilla in the ice, and some during the battle with the two X-Seijins, but other than that, characters were left empty and just there.

The designs for characters were an interesting lot. The mutants wear skin-tight black outfits with silver armor over parts of their body such as their chest and shoulders. They were very plain and simple, and they work quite well, but one has to wonder how something so simple could really do any good against a monster attack. The human characters' clothing looks like they had no other choice on what to wear because some of it just looked awkward. Gordon had on a muscle shirt with a long green coat, and it just did not seem to go together well. The X-Seijin's on the other hand, had some spiffy looking outfits. While they were black and plain, it fitted them perfectly well in the style department. Their coats look like they are made out of vinyl or leather, but very durable. Also, the leader seems to love to flaunt his coat every time he pulls off a move while fighting, which was both cool and funny at the same time.

Well, now that you have been bored with the human characters, it is time to move on to the part everyone wants to read about, the Kaiju. Godzilla has a greenish body and looks more like the version from the Heisei movies rather than the more recent Millennium saga because his spines are not huge and pointy. His body is very thin looking when compared to all the previous versions since the Heisei series, which Kitamura said he wanted it that way so Godzilla could easily travel across the world. The eyes are orange, which brings in memories of the ""Burning"" Godzilla from ""Godzilla vs. Destoroyah."" The design of Godzilla looks flawless until he is shown on his side. His head looks too round on top, and it makes it look a little deformed, especially in the scene when Rodan flies his spiky chest over Godzilla's head. If it were not for that, this incarnation would probably be quite impressive.

Next up is Manda, who also looks impressive for the short battle he is in. Manda looks like a large snake with little arms and a dragon's head, which gives him a nice distinct look. There is really nothing wrong with this design as he is not around long enough to find one. In fact, if you think of what a live action version of Dragonball's Shenron would look like, then you have Manda.

Rodan's design looks like a combination of both the Showa and Heisei series one. He has the elongated neck that seems to move around unnaturally at times as the Showa era's used to do, while his body is reminiscent of the Heisei design. His face is also more like the Showa's as he only has two spikes curving toward his body instead of three spikes with the two on the sides curving upward. He has a reddish colored body, and his wings are quite long. Also, while Rodan is attacking New York City, you can see the air vibrate due to his speed, causing everything in its path to explode.

The Godzilla that was made by Sony for America even has a part in this movie. The main difference is he is just named Zilla in the movie as Toho does not consider him to be a real Godzilla incarnation (also known as GINO (Godzilla In Name Only) by many purists). Zilla looks just like he did in his own movie, a giant iguana-like lizard, just not as good looking. The CGI looks unfinished as he travels through Sydney during the day time. Fortunately, it is not as noticeable during the night battle with Godzilla, but the battle only lasts about twenty-two seconds, so there is not time to notice it. For those that hated how Zilla only ate fish in his movie, well fear not, because in this movie, he decides to chow down on some fresh humans.

Like Manda and many others, Anguirus has not been seen since the movies of the Showa series. Anguirus was last seen in 1974's ""Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla."" In this version, Anguirus' overall look is similar to the old one, but he looks more ferocious and serious. Gone are the big bulgy eyes and replaced with small yellow eyes that show he is not to be messed with. The spikes on his upper shell curve toward his head instead of his tail so that he can roll up in a ball and cause mass destruction. His head's spikes look like he has a crown on his head, and his body color is a grayish green, while the spikes are yellow.

King Ceasar, also has not been seen since ""Godzilla vs. MechaGodzilla,"" does not look all that different from his appearance in that movie. The biggest change is he does not have as much hair as he did then, and it works. He has armor on his body like breast plates (makes you wonder if his name is really Queen Ceasar), on his knees, and on his heels. It is still hard to determine if he is a giant dog or a giant lion though. Nonetheless, King Ceasar is still a cool monster, but he does not do much of anything other than jump at Godzilla.

There is no way to really describe Kamakirasu and Kumonga as they both just look like giant insects. Kamakirasu is green instead of red as Mantises are, while Kumonga is brown with yellow stripes. Neither of these monsters did anything to Godzilla either, making one wonder what their point was. Seeing the Kamakirasu take down an EDF ship in Paris was quite enjoyable though.

Next up is Ebirah, who like Kamakirasu and Kumonga, was just a useless giant lobster. Ebirah's skin is a reddish tone with spikes going down his body on the sides and back. One of his claws is smaller than the other, but this monster gets beaten pretty easily by the mutants before he is teleported away.

The terror begins as Minilla is the light hearted monster in the movie. Minilla looks just as cute as he did in the Showa era, only his skin is green instead of grayish. His eyes are just as big as they were thirty-six years ago, as is his smile. He starts out human sized, but grows right after he tried to blow flames out of his mouth. Nothing has changed with Minilla since the days of the Showa era, which has both positive and negative effects to the movie's atmosphere.

Gigan is given two different forms in this movie, and both are probably the most unique and best designs in the entire movie. To start, Gigan looks more like a cyborg in this movie rather than just have a saw on his chest with a green and gold organic looking body. His skin has a blue tint to it and the skin overlaps each other as if they were scales. Red is used for his eye and wings. Silver is used on both of Gigan's claws, his beak, spiked knee braces, body saw, spikes on his back, and the end of his tail. Gigan's ""Powered Up"" form replaces his claw arms for double-chained saws and a silver neck brace. His first form's claws have two smaller claws close to his elbows that launch and wrap around their target so Gigan can either strangle them or pull them close to him so slice with his body saw.

While some of the monsters were pretty pointless, none of them can match the uselessness of Hedorah. Hedorah lands next to a building, but before you could even get a good look at him, Ebirah flies into one of his eyes and they are both blown up by Godzilla. The only time you can get a good look at him is by looking at pictures drawings or by pausing the movie, but even then you do not get a good look at him. From what can be described, he looks just like he does in the Showa version, a big blob of pollution with one huge round eye, and an oval-shaped eye.

Mothra is pretty much the same as he/she has looked over the last forty years. This incarnation has quite a bit of hair, and could have just been the same model used for ""Godzilla x Mothra x MechaGodzilla: Tokyo S.O.S."" The wings are humongous and look gorgeous in details.

The new monster of the movie, Monster X, is the only monster to really give Godzilla a challenge. He has a black body which looks like his muscle tissue, with a grayish skeleton on the outside covering parts of his body. His shoulders have what looks like half a dragon skull on each side, with his head in between them. His head has two horns in the center of it, and looks like the skull is covering some ugly black head underneath it. Monster X's eyes are as red as blood and he has two tails. While the design is excellent, it is easy to tell that there is a person in the suit by the way it moves.

Finally, Monster X mutates into the behemoth dragon Kaiser Ghidorah. As always, Ghidorah retains a golden color, three heads, wings, and two tails. What is different with this version is he has four legs, similar to Death Ghidorah from 1996's ""Mothra"" movie. Ghidorah also has blue highlights intermixed with the golden body of his. Each one of the heads are shaped differently such as the one on the right having three horns on his head, two horns that branch out for the middle head, and two curved horns on his left head. There are also claws on his wings. Just like with Monster X, his eyes are a blood red. Kaiser Ghidorah is certainly an interesting version of Ghidorah, and quite a powerful as well. It is unfortunate that his battle with Godzilla is not as long as it was when he was Monster X.

The special effects in ""Godzilla Final Wars"" are just as impressive as the monster designs, aside from a few issues. As mentioned before, Zilla's CGI does not look that great, but when it comes to explosions, Toho knew what they were doing, as always. The scene where Manda turns yellow from the lava's heat looks a little awkward, but works just great thanks to the dark background. CGI is not the only issue in the special effects area though. While fighting Godzilla, Kumonga mostly attacks by spitting out his webbing, but it is easy to tell the web is made of rope. The web looked fine once it hit Godzilla, but if it were not for the battle being so short; it could have taken away from the mood. Aside from those issues, the movie's effects looked wonderful. The Gotengo and the other EDF and X-Seijin ships looked realistic throughout the entire movie, so there are no complaints in that department. Although they are not the best effects in a Godzilla movie ever, they are definitely close to the top, especially with the effects used when Rodan flew through New York City.

The monster battles themselves have something left to be desired though. To start, some of the battles were pointless (as mentioned above), while others were good but one sided. The one between Godzilla, Rodan, Anguirus, and King Ceasar is a good example. The four monsters come running toward each other (or flying in Rodan's case), but Godzilla uses Anguirus' head as a springboard to leap over the oncoming monsters and cause them to crash into each other. When Anguirus rolls into a ball, Godzilla and King Ceasar have a little ""Shaolin Soccer"" moment with him. Once the fun is over, the three monsters are knocked unconscious without warning and Godzilla moves on to the next battle. While some Zilla haters will love seeing Zilla get beaten within thirty seconds, it would have been an interesting battle had Toho not used it to make fun of the monster. Finally, there is Hedorah once again, the most useless piece of junk (no pun intended) in this movie. He did not have a point at all and Toho did not need to waste their money making a costume for him.

The soundtrack itself is a mixed bag. Some tunes come out perfect and really fit the mood (such as Godzilla's techno theme at the beginning of the movie and during the battle with Kaiser Ghidorah), while other times it sounds like something out of the 1987's ""Masters of the Universe."" Keith Emerson is given the most credits for the soundtrack, as most of it is done by him, with Akira Ifukube doing a remix of the Godzilla theme for the opening of the movie (which shows clips of the different versions of Godzilla throughout the last fifty years). Also, Masaru Sat's Minilla theme is played when Minilla first appears, and his MechaGodzilla theme is heard on the radio two guys stationed at Area G (where Godzilla is imprisoned) are listening to. Also, Nobuhiko Morino and Daisuke Yano worked on the soundtrack as well. They are best known for the music they did in Kitamura's ""Versus."" There is a song in here from the band Sum 41, which at first you think it does not belong anywhere in the movie, but after hearing it played during the battle with Zilla, it fits very well.

In the end, Kitamura made a very entertaining movie for everyone to enjoy. Whether there is only one specific era of Godzilla movies (Showa, Heisei, Millennium) you like, there something in here for every one, even those who are not Godzilla fans.

Once again, the question remains unchanged, is ""Godzilla Final Wars"" worthy of the being the final movie for now? I highly recommend you watch and decide that for yourself.

...it gave me a headache actually! My wife and I watched it and here are a few thoughts from a long time Godzilla fan. I know some G fans will hate this...but the truth is the film is a mess...it would have been better without any kaiju...thus sparing us the insipid return of the truly awful 70s style of godzilla fights.

This is the godzilla film to the attention deficit generation....those who think rapid editing and one liners make a good film

the good....we both liked Don Fry and the lead Alien...both seemed to
be in on the joke. Some of the visuals and action were well done

The bad...well...we HATED how Godzilla looked...my least favorite
suit since the god awful G84 , with that versions ping pong eyes and buck
teeth.my wife said she would have even prefered the GMK beer
belly Godzilla over this one. this suit was anorexic and had a duck
bill face...truly a disaster... plus the kaiju fights were too fast and the monsters never
looked more than guys in suits...more like an ultraman kaiju than a
modern godzilla film.
All in all...its like the director took THE MATRIX, X MEN, INDEPENDENCE
DAY and all the bad elements of the 60s and 70s G films...put them in
a blender and hit puree.....for a LOOOOOONG time...

All in all...a pretty insipid Godzilla film...no ...wait. It does not EVEN SEEM to be a Godzilla film. For hard core fanboys and those with high tolerance for pain only.....",1128816000,6,1454,4.64591439688716

8036563,2,B00061Q6VU,"I had my reservations concerning this movie when I heard that director Ryuhei Kitamura (director of such hyper kinetic manga inspired fare such as Versus and Azumi) was going to bring his flair to a Godzilla movie. His style struck me as ill-suited. Then I watched it and it boggled my mind, and gave me a headacheand a stomach acheand all sorts of aches. Godzilla: Final Wars is both a mess and delivers on the action, in spades; of course much of the action is posing and music-video style fighting between superhumans and aliens that look human. The last hour just doesnt let up and thats not a good thing. The monster action, of which there is copious amount in the last 30 minutes and only sparse amounts sprinkled stingily throughout beforehand, is both inventive and ridiculous and cheap. At one point Godzilla (truly the king of all monsters in this movie) is playing soccer with Rodan, King Seesar, and Anguirus (withAnguirus?) and the humanization of their actions may make you laugh but it also will take the monster right out of the monsters; even the brief encounter that Godzilla has with Zilla where Godzilla literally blows Zilla away is handles in the cheapest way possible and exists solely to get a rise out of fans who cannot and will not regard the 1998 American bastardization of Godzilla as truly Godzilla. At around 2 hours the film has kicked you in the face far too many times, and laughed at you with its pathetic acting and burned your eyeballs out with its neon brightness. Its far more than younger viewers can and should be asked to handle. Its wearisome. And yet, teenagersI know some teenage boys who have liked the film.

Whats the plot? Its essentially Destroy All Monsters. Aliens want to control the world and they use the earths monsters to beat the world into submission. There is a small group of super-soldier earthers who resist the aliens. The aliens cant control Godzilla, and neither can humanity, and Godzilla threatens to destroy everyone. Ugh, this movie is so bad. Destroy All Monsters is a rightful classic and this will never take its place.",1512864000,,2092,4.747252747252747
