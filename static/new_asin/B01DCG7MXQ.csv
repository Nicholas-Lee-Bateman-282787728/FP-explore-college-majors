7710846,3,B01DCG7MXQ,"It must be said that this film pre dates anything Tarantino or Del Toro have created. Vince Gilligan had not introduced Walter White or Jesse Pinkman to the world of villainy when Small Time showed up on the indy film scene. That is why this film must be appreciated thoroughly for its camp, quips, micro cast and budget. Best with an afternoon barbeque, dark brews and friends.",1433462400,4,378,4.656716417910448
