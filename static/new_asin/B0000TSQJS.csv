1945806,4,B0000TSQJS,"I think the script did not need to have CJ die. A fine man had come to love her, he wound could have been superficial instead of killing her and the baby. Whether or nor the totally greedy mother who left her infant behind got away with the drug hall is another matter. If she had been stopped and the drugs available to turn in to the police, all could have been well. O.K. rewriting the story seems like great hubris, but the given ending was so utterly tragic and such a total downer, something needed to be done.",1251417600,,516,4.222222222222222
1945807,3,B0000TSQJS,"I recommend this simply because all movies cant be filled with over-hyped 'A' list actors who do over-rated films.

This film suits the B- list movie crowd ( which is way bigger than the 'A' list crowd.

My rating B- and recommended.

The acting by Darryl is fine although she and her young failed priest co-star have no chemistry on screen at all...

The two young actors suck.

The plot has been done before but it's still very watchable",1141084800,,439,4.506329113924051
1945808,3,B0000TSQJS,"THE JOB is a puzzling movie.  As a character study, it succeeds mainly due to Daryl Hannah's draining performance, and Eric Mabius' interesting portrait of an ex-priest whose carnal desires still yield to his former profession.  Hannah plays a hitwoman who discovers she's pregnant, and lo and behold, her latest ""job"" is a young couple, the wife also pregnant.  Hannah's dilemma is explained with rather tragic flashbacks from her childhood, and she has the boss from hell played with venomous ferocity by the late Alex Rocco.  Brad Renfro and Dominique Swain play the young couple who turn to selling drugs to purchase an ideal life.  As the movie progresses, though, we begin to wonder who is worse?  Hannah the hitwoman or Swain the self-centered, vicious wife?

Some of the action sequences are not very realistic; how can non-professionals like Renfro and Swain be such good shots with guns, topping a professional?  The ending is also a disappointment as it plainly doesn't make much sense.

Still, THE JOB deserves credit for its unique approach to an unusual situation.",1114214400,2,1078,5.045197740112994
1945809,3,B0000TSQJS,"There are several positives about this film. There are also some negatives, and the two balance each other out to a reasonable three star review.

One gets a sense that the producers were aiming for something along the lines of Requiem for a Dream - a movie that had me contemplating the merits of suicide when I finished watching it (not really). The aim was definitely for such intense depravity that the viewer would be sucked into horrid despair.

Daryl Hannah (C.J.) put in a credible performance of a hit woman ""gone soft"". It's unlikely that she would have been in such a state if her mark weren't a husband and his pregnant wife while she was pregnant herself. There we have a positive and a negative combined. Terrific, persuasive performance, tainted by a ""just so happens"" type of circumstance. That's clumsy writing.

I enjoyed the flashbacks to C.J.'s childhood. We often see hardened characters on the screen without any understanding as to what steeled them. Here we know - and this explanation is not tainted. It's rather sad and moving.

Initially I thought that the introduction of a former priest (Eric Mabius as Rick) to the production was rather cheap and on the cheesy side. Why in the world would someone so wholesome and pure be so interested in such damaged goods? The answer is rather simple. He was a former priest. You can leave the frock behind, but you can't leave the desire to save people behind. He recognized someone in desperate need of salvation and refused to let go. One imagines, and must forgive, that there was an obvious physical attraction on his part; otherwise, he would not have been so interested. Still, it wasn't as unbelievable as I initially thought.

Brad Renfro, who is unfortunately losing his hair and his boyish good looks, is still a good actor, and demonstrates believably that he is a man trying to do good by his wife, who, on top of being a reformed hooker, is also self-absorbed. For example, when he comes back to the motel with a gunshot wound, her first question is, ""Did you sell it?"" That was, of course, in reference to the drugs. She didn't care about his physical well-being.

As with any movie fueled at least partly by action sequences, there were some rather unbelievable sequences. Could a woman who JUST gave birth to a baby really leave that baby lying on the table (is she truly that evil or selfish?) and run, full speed, trying to escape death? I'm not a doctor, and I don't play one on TV, but I would imagine that after giving birth - a difficult birth - that such physical activities would have been improbably, if not impossible.

The ending is rather puzzling. There is a climax, and a dnouement. I had questions regarding both. Mainly, people shot in the stomach usually aren't capable of hauling themselves halfway across town. Stomach wounds are supposed to be considerably painful. Concerning the dnouement, I'll say two things: she was shot in the stomach (so how did she...??) and Rick was absent. Not only was there another physical improbability, the film didn't wrap things up as well as it could have. I suppose that if Rick were present, one could argue that the ending was cheesy, but he was a savior figure. Saviors usually see things all the way through.",1112054400,7,3252,4.704745166959579
1945810,4,B0000TSQJS,"This script has several points which eventually will engage you. A young couple fascinated by the idea of making easy money; a female cold blood assassin with serious emotional conflicts never resolved from her childhood , supported by dreamingly fly backs ad finally a man who will fall in love with...

The mother instinct will work out as a fundamental device and dramatic spring ; both women practically will turn the orders and the male plains.

The greed, the violence and the redemption will blend in this dark  picture with Hannah as the merciless murderer without any scruple. Twenty grand is the cipher.

Good camera work and an intriguing thriller that gets its aim.",1111795200,,677,4.912280701754386
1945811,3,B0000TSQJS,"Hands up who has heard of Daryl Hannah? Dominique Swain? Both capable of playing violent characters, agree? Here they do it well. I'm a male, a typical male, and I liked how Daryl Hannah had a conscience while trying to kill the pregnant Swain.

Hannah's character is very real and complex. She's a hit Lady on self destruction craziness. Eric Mabius is her savior. I connected to his character.

Hannah's crime boss is enjoyable too. He loves plants? Huh?

This movie offers good violent action and very soft moments with interesting thoughts on woman to woman pregnancy combat.",1107907200,4,579,4.887755102040816

1946072,4,B0000TSQJS,"This is clearly a dark movie. Daryl Hannah is a tortured soul whose past haunts her even into her adult life and has twisted her into a cold killer. She works for a dark mafiosi figure played by Alex Rocco, ""Bugsey"" in The Godfather. A robbery goes down and a young down and out couple end up with 20 kilos of ""tar"" whatever that is, and obviously expensive drugs. Hannah's boss wants Hannah to get the 20 kilos back from the young couple, and she goes on pursuit of the couple with their precious cargo. The girlfriend is pregnant, and just wants to leave L.A. to see her mom in Arizona. The boyfriend wants to do this big score so he can buy a house when they leave town. Both losers looking for a fast buck.

In the meantime, Hannah meets a fine young man who dropped out of seminary, played by Eric Mabius, known on the Hallmark channel for his portrayal of a manager in a sitcom called ""Signed, Sealed, and Delivered."" He is a very likable personality and is probalby Hannah's saving grace.

As the movie wears on, it feels dirtier and dirtier on me, I feel the lost misery and filth of Los Angeles, where only a fortunate few live in pretentious luxury, like Hannah's boss. Such a hard, filthy life, I'm glad not to be in L.A.

Towards the end of the film Hannah tracks down the couple and the final big pursuit ensues. A little twist to the plot is that Hannah finds she is pregnant and wrestles with the moral dilemna of whether she should have a child or not.

Hannah, and her co-stars are excellent as gritty, broken souls desperately trying to survive the horrible predicament they're in, and it all comes to quite a dramatic ending.

I didn't like this movie and felt it was too long, I felt almost tortured watching it, and felt uncomfortable and sorry for all the people living in that big soulless city. I was relieved that the movie was over but got an unwelcome taste of reality, of what some people are driven to do to survive in a big city. If you are a Prime customer you can see this for free. Hannah is a total pro and it shows, as are the supporting actors. But man, what a dark, depressing movie. If you don't mind gritty reality you might find this show interesting.

So for all of you horrible critics out there that wouldn't know a good movie even if it hit you in the head, you're making a mistake if you're giving a low grade and a poor review on this movie...

I've seen movies on YouTube and Vimeo, done by children that are at the same level as those who made this film. The script is nonsensical, the continuity as the movie transitions from one scene to the next is nonexistent. The music accompaniment leaves the viewer confused and distracted. The editor has made decisions that leads one to the conclusion they obviously had garbage to work with. The acting is over done and hard to witness.

1946151,3,B0000TSQJS,"It was a good movie with plenty of action.  The acting was great although the Priest bit was unrealistic as far as I'm concerned.  Its not like he had been a ""prison priest"" with a working knowledge of how the psych worked, its like he was dropped onto the earth with no prior knowledge of life at all.  A clean cut little boy man who still believed in ""sins of the flesh"".  I found his character totally insipid.  The title of the movie bore true: it was just a job and the people with whom she dealt had the profound knowledge that their job was extremely dangerous and that they too may end up on the receiving end of the bullet. Easy as that. Its a violent movie, but more than just your typical crime drama. There was no good guys involved. There were no hero's. People's perception of the film is interesting too.  Maybe Hanna broke the stereotype of a weak woman.  The stereotype of a woman needing a man to save her: who is seeking some type of affirmation or moral redemption. It was a very unusual role she played. I'm glad about the ending, although I have a feeling the studio changed the ending to make it more palatable to the audience.

This movie may not be for everyone, but I gave it a solid three stars.  If it wasn't for the Priest bit, I would have given it a four.  All the female actresses were fantastic.

For an assassin, I thought Hannah's character was really fragile, submissive and timid, making it hard to believe her as a cold blooded assassin. Also, I can't really picture why a good looking x-priest would go for such a trashy looking drunk woman in a bar and then proceed to practically stalk her.

1946154,3,B0000TSQJS,"The Job (2003) is an unconvincing thriller, centered on a hitwoman who is having major difficulties completing her assignment, while also coping with a number of personal problems.

The problem lies mostly with writer/director Kenny Golde's screenplay, which attempts to be suspenseful and also sensitive, but instead mostly comes off as pretentiously cliched, and sloppy.

Hired killer CJ March (Hannah) murders a man, but fails to recover a shipment of drugs for her employer Vernon Cray (Rocco).  March gets on the trail of a drug dealer she believes has the shipment, but looking for some quick cash, a small time crook named Troy (Renfro), and his pregnant girlfriend Emily (Swain), murder the dealer, and make off with a large stash of heroin.

March's life is further complicated because she is pregnant, and is contemplating an abortion.  She also has just become romantically involved with Rick (Mabius), a former priest.  Troy and Emily are in hiding, but are having no luck in selling the drugs.  March easily tracks down the runaway couple, but resists killing them, until she has no options left.

The Job aspires to be a fully fleshed out suspense thriller with some clever nuances, but fails pretty badly.  The burned out March displays little professional competence, and she pays with her blood more than once, for her poor judgment.  The attempts to explore some emotionally sensitive subjects is done rather clumsily, and an abortion attempt in a bathtub is quite pathetic.  The relationship between CJ and Rick seems forced, and Vernon Cray seems like a cartoon character.  In one of the few bright spots, Dominique Swain ""delivers"" an entertaining performance, as her character's survival instinct shifts into overdrive.

It plays like a Lifetime movie, and the story is one huge clich, but if you are a Prime member looking for a little low grade suspense, you might want to give The Job a chance.  Rating: 2.5 stars.",1347235200,,2616,6.329577464788732

8002877,4,B0000TSQJS,"Daryl Hannah plays CJ March, a hit woman from nine years old or so. She has one last job to do--return bricks of ""tar"" worth a street value of $500,000. Unfortunately for her, CJ learns she is pregnant, and her raging hormones have given her a more compassionate attitude. Meanwhile, a young couple have stolen the drugs after the husband kills the drug dealer. The husband's wife is pregnant and due any time. C.J. doesn't want to kill the girl or her husband because of the due pregnancy. The ending has several surprising twists that make for a truly interesting show. I recommend this Four Stars movie for acting and story line.",1517961600,,632,4.651785714285714

8002880,3,B0000TSQJS,"Good acting on her part, bad casting, in terms of her boyfriend, and the drug boss. The other actors were great, believable, not what others might think, not an action adventure, this is a gritty drama, held no punches. They should have shown that mother addicted to more than cigs, she acted like an addict, like on meth or heroin. The boyfriend should have been cast as somebody darker, more jaded, Jim Civeasal could have done that role, plus he was too short for her.
Plot line was sketchy at places, director was just wrong in a lot of scenes, like an assassin working as long as she had would never reveal a gun until the last second, certainly never run down a street with it in her hand, like she did a dozen times. That was just dumb. She tucked the gun in her pants at the back, so visible, nothing like what an assassin would do. There were a hundred small things wrong, like the old car she drove when she was paid $20,000 for a hit, she would have something like a Camaro SS. She was using the wrong gun, didn't care about the sound, no assassin would use a 45 revolver like that with 6 rounds. The drug boss had the wrong gun too, didn't show the screen he set up to keep her from bringing a gun into his place, ... just hundreds of small mistakes like that.",1503964800,3,1272,4.238683127572016
8002881,5,B0000TSQJS,I liked that the aspect ratio was 16:9 and I liked that it was genuine 5.1 surround. I knew if I persevered that I would get true surround. The description said stereo so I will disregard the description. Poor metadata is disappointing. I liked the violence that was mostly gun shooting.,1499472000,,287,4.647058823529412
