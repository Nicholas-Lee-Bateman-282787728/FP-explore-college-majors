5076948,5,B007C8GK8Y,"SILK the Bellydance Veil Workout:
This is a low impact workout that will help you say goodbye to flabby arms! Even if you are not a belly dancer, you can do this! Tanna Valentine breaks down the moves so that you can follow along with no problems! She even covers how to obtain the right veil for you! If you love the pretty side of belly dance, you will enjoy this one! I would classify this one as beginner to intermediate.",1338249600,,425,4.2592592592592595
5076949,5,B007C8GK8Y,"Bought this on a whim without expecting too much after working with veils for over a decade but was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoy it. The ""flow"" is smooth and so much fun to get a quick workout/dance when short of time or when your just not feeling improvisational that day. Have used several times and recommended to friends. I agree it would be great for beginners but I think any dancer would enjoy this DVD.",1337644800,5,422,4.423076923076923
5076950,4,B007C8GK8Y,I like this video...it shows you a few moves as she had mentioned; which is enough for me.  I would like to see someone make a video with more veil moves.,1337472000,,154,3.967741935483871
5076951,5,B007C8GK8Y,"I am a beginner (bellydancer) and have not had very much experience with the veil. I was interested in trying it, so I bought this dvd and I was not disappointed.

The instructor makes everything clear & easy to learn, so you can get to the veil workout and start dancing. The break downs are great and she covers traveling steps, turns, and a few basic bellydance moves (undulations, shimmies, snake arms, figure eights, etc.) that are used in the veil dance workout choreography. If you have never bellydanced or used the veil before, you can accomplish all the material on this DVD.

But do know, this information is not meant to be a complete instructional on veil work. It does not cover all the in's & outs of all beginning veil technique. It's focus was more on learning the steps to be able to do the veil dance workout as fun exercise.

Once you learn all the moves then you can go onto the veil dance workout portion of the DVD. The workout is sectioned into 6 sections of about 5- 6 mintues each- that flow from one to the other. The tempo varies from slow to medium-then to a faster pace throughout the workout. There really isn't a warm- up or cool down, but the first section starts off at a gentle, slower pace, and for me was a warm-up enough. The veil movements you are doing are not overly hard or strenuous either. It works your arms, hips, legs and core in a more gentle manner.  After doing the first two sections, I could really feel it in my arms. And once I did the workout about almost all the way through (35 to 40 mintues), I did break a sweat.

The DVD is set up like this:
Welcome
Intro to Veil
Tutorials
-Holding the Veil
-Veil Technique/Tricks
-Turns
-Travel Steps/Basic Bellydance Moves

Veil Workout-with voice over cues & music
  or music only
3 Costumed Performances- Fan Veil* Veil * Feather Fan

The costuming and music was done well, and the production quality of this DVD is excellent. Some of my fav songs were: ""Paradise Lost (Return to Shagri-La) by DJ Zen, ""Ride to Morrocco"" & ""Temple at Luxor"" Sensual Bellydance II  (Aradia & DJ Zen).

A very nice dvd, lots of fun to work with. I did not get bored.
I would recommend this one, for those looking for a nice, low-impact dance for exercise or interested in trying the veil. (It's a lot of fun)

Those dancers experienced in veil work would not probably find anything new but you might enjoy the veil workout choreography. Those looking for a hard core workout, would be better off finding something else. (And if you are in great shape, you might not break a sweat.)",1336176000,12,2560,4.458244111349036
5076952,5,B007C8GK8Y,"Tanna's done it again! This is my most favorite bellydance DVD, right next to Cocktail. I wish Tanna would put out more bellydance DVDs using the same format. She covers quite a few veil moves in a small amount of time, but she does it in a way that puts beginners at ease, with reminders about safety and paying attention to what's comfortable for you. I have a fairly large bellydance DVD collection, but this has to be one of my most top-rated. It has plenty of WOW! factor. You feel like WOW! I can do that. And it's amazing. But the best part is that Tanna has provided some fabulous workouts. They are fun to do but you look amazing while doing them. This is my idea of exercise!

Love it, love it, love it!

If you want to buy only two bellydance DVDs, get Tanna's Cocktail and Silk. They give you a sense of having accomplished a great deal in a short time, but you will keep coming back to them because the workouts are so much more fun than what you typically find ... and they are timed well, too, so you can do one or more of them at a time. (You have to do your own warm-up and cool-down, however.) The music will keep you motivated and, once again, Tanna's picked some appropriate costumes that work very well with the whole flavor of the piece. I love folkloric bellydance and veil work, and this DVD fits right in.

The only complaint I have is that whoever put together the DVD wasn't the brightest bulb on the Christmas tree. The instruction sections had horrible transitions that detracted from what was going on, proving that just because a transition exists doesn't mean it's appropriate for the project you're working on. In the intro I noticed at least one sequence that didn't have any transitions at all. Somebody didn't preview the video well before rendering, I suspect. But at least the workout section itself flowed well with fade outs and fade ins.

If you don't own this, get it now. It has such value for your money. Just focus on Tanna and try to ignore the transition problem. Tanna is a great instructor and she's really taken the time to make this approachable for everyone. If you are a beginner, you will be able to learn a lot in a short amount of time. If you already love bellydance, you will pick up some great moves.

Rating the content of this and Tanna as an instructor, I would have to give it more than five stars. Where are the ten star ratings? This DVD is doubly good ... dancing that's a workout, and all put together in a format that's appealing and easy to use.",1336003200,15,2514,4.374732334047109
5076956,4,B007C8GK8Y,Great as a workout video. Not so much for showing moves. Beginner to intermediate moves. If you want a workout to keep you in practice this is a good video for that.,1370390400,,165,4.1875
5076957,3,B007C8GK8Y,"This is a great DVD for people who have difficulities with veil-parts. But only 1 thing I don't like about this DVD is they explain facing us. if they were facing the mirror, I would not confuse right and left and a lot easier to understand.",1367625600,2,241,4.260869565217392
5076958,4,B007C8GK8Y,This instructional video covers everything!  It is thorough and presents endless variations of veil uses.  One of the best I have purchased and I have over 20 instructional bellydance dvds. The only feature I would have liked would be to have the instructional segments include several counts of music to practice the movements with.,1364688000,,333,5.148148148148148
5076959,5,B007C8GK8Y,"This has become my new favorite belly dance workout.  Tanna does a great job with the basics of veil work, and you actually get a feel of what it is like to perform with a veil.  My other veil DVD has tons of technical moves and information, but does not give you the sense of performing that Tanna's DVD gives you.

I'm still working on getting through the whole workout; you will definitely feel the work you are doing with your arms and shoulders.

A must have for the dancer!",1359936000,,479,4.288888888888889
5076960,4,B007C8GK8Y,"I like this dvd.  It is fantastic if you want to practise veil technique. The work-out is 37 minutes one with voice and one with just music.  The tutorial on the moves is 69 minutes, which is very informative, I have learnt so much about veil holds and movements (even though she says it is not an instructional dvd) which I have done in the past and now I know the names of all the moves I have done in classes which I didn't know before I just learnt them and danced them.  I recommend this to polish up dancing with a veil and even for learning how to dance with a veil.  I like this dvd and recommend it.  (More is gotten out of this if you get a veil the right length before doing it).",1354406400,3,690,4.007299270072993
5076961,4,B007C8GK8Y,"I bought this DVD because I rarely use veil and I needed a way to improve my veil skills, without going through yet another ponderous veil instructional. I know how to do all the movements, but I needed a reason to.  Over time, my veil skills have atrophied.  The DVD did deliver what I asked - long sequences of veil choreography designed to strengthen your arms and develop your veil vocabulary.  Since Ms. Valentine comes from the Vintage Orientale tradition, and I had enjoyed her&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cocktail-The-Classic-Cabaret-Bellydance-Workout/dp/B00095NXBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cocktail - The Classic Cabaret Bellydance Workout</a>, I bought this DVD.

Within the first segment, my arms were already BURNING.  Rarely does a bellydancer perform veilwork for more than five minutes.  An Egyptian dancer may only use her veil for 1-2 minutes during her entrance.  This video, at 40 minutes, will indeed strengthen your arms and improve your veil carriage.  Most choreography DVDs will only have small segments of veil, not long enough to perfect technique.  Most veil dvds only show one move at a time, having you practice it, and move on.  Neither type will make you stronger, and neither will really challenge you to improve your veil skills. (In the first, you will move too quickly beyond the veil segment to perfect it. In the latter, you would not be challenged to combine the movements together).  So, it's a great learning tool, this, as well as an arm-burner.

The choreography is not difficult, but it will take me - a ten year bellydance veteran - some time to perfect it.  The cues are not precise (i.e. ""and turn"" vs. ""turn three times""), so you can't beat yourself up if you are still in the midst of a turn when you hear the next cue and you have to skurry to catch up.  Or you can just enjoy the flow.  Be prepared to perfect your turns, spins and arabesques.

Many different veil movements are shown here, most familiar, some new.  Tanna Valentine uses her veil in creative ways, and the DVD goes from slow and smooth, to fast with shimmies, to full of arabesques and turns.  In essence, the different ways a dancer can use the veil to accent different pieces of music.

I was somewhat disappointed with the music. I know from an interview I saw with TAnna, that she enjoys working with the traditional music and dances TO the music. However, much of the music in this DVD was not the veil songs that all Vintage Orientale dancers must know (i.e. Bir Demet, Jemileh, T'Sagapo, Cleopatra, to name a few) - but rather it had many new-age pieces.  I suspect this had to do with musical rights.  While her ""Cocktail"" title brought back the old days of the New York clubs, the music here has a different feeling.  On the other hand, it was still well-suited for veilwork and eventually you learn to ignore it just like most exercise DVDs.

The veil moves are broken down, so that a beginner to veil could learn the movements before doing the workout.  I think it's a good thing to have this separated out, to give the DVD a broader appeal to different levels.

Finally three performances are included. One of them is fan-veil. I've only seen parts of these, but it's a nice touch.",1352764800,12,3260,4.86231884057971
5076962,5,B007C8GK8Y,Perfect for beginners. Easy to follow up steps. Simple and gracefull movements with wonderful musik creates beautiful dance flow. I recomend this DVD to everybody who likes dancing with a veil. Great performance of Tanna!,1350691200,,221,5.3428571428571425
5076963,5,B007C8GK8Y,"Make sure you watch the welcome on this video because Tana Valentine explains exactly what this programme is meant to do. And that's important because this is not a veil instructional or how-to. The idea is a ""danceout"" which is an annoying term I have to take credit for when I described Luscious, the dance workout featuring Neon, Blanca and Sarah Skinner. This one too is meant to give your upper body a good workout but also build spontaneity comfort and flow for those who like to dance with the veil. To achieve this, we're going to learn a choreography.
But first, a little chat about four or five types of veils, including what you can do to start straight away if you don't have a standard veil around at home.
Tana does have a pretty solid tutorial segment next in which each  veil move to be used is demonstrated. This includes basic moves like wraps and figure eights and many accents like pulses and flutters. All through, Tana gives a lot of advice on how to use the move best, what to watch out for, etc.  I really like the way she talks to the learner, easily and without any of those fake stylizations. The moves are not separately accessible from the menu, unless I'm missing something. Tanna teaches a few turn patterns as well, focusing again on the turns that are to be used. So that's turns like the barrel turn, a waist spin and others that really use your obliques and of course, the rest of the upper body and arms. I'm thinking I'll give up on my weights and take up veil moves instead - much prettier, I think. The spins give way to some traveling steps like the arabesque, step-hip, triple-step, traveling side undulation, a Turkish step, and traveling hip circles. To round off the tutorial, you have to also learn undulations, the shimmy and snake arms. This video is meant to be accessible to even those who aren't setting out to learn belly dance, per se but just want to do a pretty workout that's fun.
The ""Silk Workout"" then begins. The choreography isn't taught in the usual format of breaking things down into combos, explaining, and practicing, before going on to the next one and perhaps stringing each successive combo together.  Because the moves have been taught already and because the choreography is slow and easy, you can just follow along and keep up. If you miss something, the moves are anyway repeated within the choreo. There's a lot of to-the-right and to-the-left, further making it a basic choreography. This is really nice both for those who are just learning the veil and those who want their workout. The focus is not on belly dance intricacies although the belly dance look and style is maintained throughout. The choreo really has a good variety of steps and moves.
I violently hate the music, which has a Chinese or Japanese touch, I'm afraid I can't tell the difference. Two other dancers dance with Tana in a format that seems to have become a huge favorite with World Dance New York, the publishers of this video.
But when the first slow choreo is over, we get into a faster and different choreo to much, much nicer music. Tana cues you for each upcoming movie in a nice well-timed way so you can easily keep pace - just as long as you've done the tutorial or, for those who already know how to veil-dance, you have familiarized yourself with the terms she uses.
Next, there's yet another workout that's faster yet, with some shimmies and choo choos etc thrown in for a more active workout. A fourth workout is sort of medium paced but with lots of arm scoops and dips. And just when you think it's over, there's another workout, faster, with shimmies, arabesques and turns. With this, the 5th workout, you should be fairly exercised and keeping pace with this one will need your alertness. There are altogether 6 workout sections, making up about 35 minutes of work.
Don't ask me if you're going to sweat. That's a favorite question about workouts, but really, it differs from person to person. I frankly don't remember sweating at all until I was about 48 years old. Just before that, five hours of hgh speed salsa wouldn't make me sweat. Now... well... let's not go there.
You can do these six workouts with or without the voice clues, as is typical with many videos.
To end with, you have three performances by each of the dancers on the video.
I really like this video, and I'm looking at it more from the perspective of its intended audience because I haven't done much veil dancing. I think the variations on the workouts is really nice and keeps you motivated. The video is neatly conceptualized, unique in that it's focused on working out, and nicely delivered.

5076964,5,B007C8GK8Y,"Salome knew what she was doing when she danced with veils to seduce....they are amazing when used well, and in this instructional DVD, Tanna Valentine will do just that; she reminds us that this DVD is not meant to teach us all the techniques of veil dancing, but we will get a lot of instruction on different moves, what type of veil, with what fabric to use for different effects, and also get a wonderful, low-impact workout, that especially will do marvelous things for your arms and shoulders, both areas that usually need attention for us older gals.

Tanna explains everything with such conciseness and is always understandable. Her speech is neither rushed nor too slow, and has the perfect energy level to guide us through this entire 130 minute DVD. The workout section is excellent, and you will definitely feel it, especially after a few rounds of Mr. Twister, but as stated before, it's all low-impact, and even beginners to belly dancing will benefit from this and be able to follow along.

The tutorial gives us simple but graceful and lovely choreography, and is demonstrated by Tanna, Yoshina and Giselle. The costumes are gorgeous, and photography excellent throughout. You can always see every movement clearly. All these dances are gentle on the body, and yet are good exercise, as we learn to use the veil as ""a second skin."" There are 3 terrific bonus performances: #1 is by Tanna, using 2 shorter pieces of flowing fabric, each attached to a fan, #2 is danced by Yoshina, and is extremely beautiful and expressive, with an inventive use of a veil, and #3 is danced by Giselle, using a giant feathered fan. Music is also good, by BJZen, Aradia, Jon Gregory, Ensemble Al-Asdeka, Shiva in Exile, Copal, and Alladeen.",1338336000,5,1736,4.822147651006712
5076965,5,B007C8GK8Y,"SILK with Tanna Valentine is a belly dance, fitness based, work out with total focus on veil work. The program features several songs beautifully choreographed, vivid in color which enhances the beautiful costumes and dancers. This is not a veil instructional product and does not focus on technique. This program is  beautiful to view, learn, and dance along to.

Tanna Valentine is a lovely dancer, and a well versed instructor. She has numerous contributions to belly dance on instructional DVD's which I am fortunate to own. Her welcome is warm and much is explained about the origins of the veil, which are a western trademark used by many dancers as a prop for entertaining and expressing lyrical dance. More than that, veil work is a fantastic workout for the upper body and helps correct posture, and tone the arms. To continue, Tanna discusses the types of fabrics with adequate flow and weight suitable for this workout, such as chiffon and silk, along with the corresponding lengths.

The low impact work out is about 40 minutes in length, and is narrated step by step with voice over's, or you may choose music only. This is preceded by the corresponding tutorial with elaborate details on posture, veil hand placement, veil movement, veil movement layered on varied footwork patterns. Every movement in the tutorial section is demonstrated clearly and prepares one for the six choreographies to follow. Some of these are bird wings, figure of eights, cocoon; a very interesting section in variations of turns, such as barrel turns; simple traveling steps such as step hip lift, and triple steps. Basic belly dance movements such as the shimmy, snake arms, and undulations fit perfectly with the veil movements here. The choreographies comprise many lovely movements, very enjoyable variations of music which feature the veils beautifully as they mimica ribbons of paint flowing in the air.

This program was easy to learn, and super enjoyable, but don't be fooled! The work out is skillfully hidden in the beauty of the veils, as keeping the arms extended and the torso erect in proper posture really works the upper body. I enjoyed the variations in music and the steady pace which was easy to keep. I worked best with a silk veil, as chiffon seems a bit heavy for my small arms.

In addition, 3 bonus performances feature Tanna in a mysterious dance with double silk fan veils, Yoshina dancing with veil, and Gisselle dancing with flirty showgirl fans. All these top off an already phenomenal program!",1338249600,3,2516,4.966745843230404
