8238806,5,B0010VUTN6,This is a great video with lots of impressive scenery.  I wish that the video was longer than 60 minutes.  Still worth the purchase.,1316476800,,132,4.458333333333333
8238807,5,B0010VUTN6,"I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I own all of the Globeriders films, and this one by far is my favorite. This movie is more personable to a rider, as the group is only Helge and a couple close friends. The other Globerider films seem to document more of the trip experience and a rider's emotions/feelings about the countries they visit. This film is about Iceland. The emphasis here is more on what Iceland looks and feels like from a motorcycle rider's perspective. Naturally, Helge gives a few hints on how to do this trip yourself. After watching this film, I immediately began putting a 5-year plan together with my wife to go see Iceland. I highly recommend this movie to anyone remotely interested in Iceland.",1307577600,,724,4.708661417322834
8238808,1,B0010VUTN6,"This video was too much like an advertisement than a video about touring in iceland.

It was like something the Icelandic board of tourism would make. There was little to no talk about adventure bike touring. No tips no tricks. Just a bunch of scenic pictures which are nice but I didn't appreciate the focus of the video.",1281916800,,322,4.551724137931035
8238809,5,B0010VUTN6,"This was an amazing program.  To witness some very skilled long-distance bikers trek across Iceland was very inspiring.  I have a cross-bike myself but have never taken it abroad.  This dvd has pushed me to seriously consider my own expedition.  I wonder if Mr. Pederson is up for another take at Iceland!  More about the program: incredible videography, insightful ecounters with local culture.  I love GlobeRiders Iceland and highly suggest you give it a go!",1252454400,,460,5.066666666666666
