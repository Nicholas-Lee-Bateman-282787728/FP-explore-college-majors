7824974,4,6302373891,"Two videos make this collection worth owning - True Faith and the Perfect Kiss.

The True Faith video has quite a concept - it starts out with mimes slapping each other to the song's beat, as other mimes watch on their TV's.  Ok, its hard to describe, but its a well done, slightly bizarre, very imaginative video.

The Perfect Kiss is just the opposite.  The entire video was filmed in one take as the band jams out the song in their studio - not the height of creativity as far as the concept, but the execution is terrific.  It offers us a truely intimate look at New Order as they play one of their masterpieces (in my opinion, their best song by far) - a complicated, layered song utilizing sequencers, keyboards, guitars, bass, drum pads and even a cowbell!  Barney, Gillian and Steven look plaintive at times, nervous and unsure at others (New Order, by and large, were probably never the greatest group in terms of their proficiency with their instruments) - even though the latter two don't have much to do save for playing some exceedingly simple keyboard parts.  Hooky, meanwhile, confidently pumps the song's bassline, switches over to drum pads, then back to bass as he belts out a rather complicated bass pattern at the end of the song.  Meanwhile, a figure meant to look like Ian Curtis (its actually someone affiliated with the band who had a strong resmeblance to Curtis), the lead singer in New Order's predecessor group, Joy Division, who hung himself years earlier, looks on over Hooky's shoulder, nodding his approval at what his former bandmates are doing.  Also notable due to the fact that the song sounds simply terrific - its more raw and powerful than the LP / Cassette / CD versions that have been distributed over the years.

The remaining videos on here are rather forgettable.  The highlight is probably Touched by the Hand of God, which shows New Order playing this song as a punked out heavy metal band (they were / are anything but) in front of a screaming crowd.",1110844800,2,1997,4.660968660968661

7824976,5,6302373891,"Im just a few years too young to have ever seen New Order on MTV.  I must say this videos are true classics, especially Bizzare Love Triangle.  The music is pure and polished and thats what made 80's synth pop so great.  Most people my age (early 20's) have never heard of New Order and its a shame cause they don't make stuff like this anymore.  Highly recommended!",1000080000,5,366,4.338235294117647
