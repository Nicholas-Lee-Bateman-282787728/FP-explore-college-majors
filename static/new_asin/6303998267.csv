760050,2,6303998267,"There were some talented actors in this, too bad they didn't get a good script.  A comedy is more than a series of sight gags strung together, even though some of those are hysterical.  Trouble is, even with the good ones, the second or third time around, they're stale.  And there are plenty of dumb ones, too.  There is a plot, sort of, but the movie veers along the track of the plot like a kid on his first bicycle ride without training wheels.

The pirate Yellowbeard captured many other galleons, killing over five-hundred men in cold blood.

My parents probably didn't know I'd ""borrowed"" it from the yacht club house and watched it all the time. I thought it was just a crazy pirate movie. Then I saw my first Monty Python, and then when I finally saw this again, I died laughing and was flabbergasted at my younger self.

760255,4,6303998267,"It's a good film that could have been better. The cast was terrific and the support actors and cameo appearances e.g. David Bowie, proved even better. The writing weakened late in the film when they struggled with the ending. What's fascinating about this film is the recognition of all the actors who make an appearance. Mr. Prostitute is Greta Blackburn who later plays the prostitute in 48 Hours. For the most part the Monty Python crowd hooked up with Mel Brook's gang plus appearances by Cheech & Chong, James Mason, & Michael Harden. If you enjoy films by Mel Brooks and Monty Python, you'll like Yellowbeard. It reminds me of those all star comedy films from Hollywood .e.g. It's a Mad, Mad, Mad World or A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum..",1465084800,2,760,4.637037037037037

In previous formats including the DVD, the picture quality and aspect ratio were disappointing, but on blu-ray Yellowbeard has finally received proper treatment. I was particularly looking forward to seeing the boats on the ocean and the island scenes, and I wasn't disappointed. Nitpickers may be able to find something wrong with it, but to me, the picture looks great throughout the movie.

There are no special features, but that's okay. Behind the scenes information on Yellowbeard is readily available in several places, including a book and a documentary, both available from Amazon.",1451779200,2,720,5.315789473684211

760695,4,6303998267,"This review is for the Blu-ray brought out by Olive Films:

Here is a different and often forgotten about funny comedy, that's a required taste. This is lovingly brought out on Blu-ray by the one and only Olive Films. This is a beautiful Blu-ray. High quality. Great vibrant color and equally important audio. The movie has never looked any better.

Its been a long time since I have seen this, and I was thoroughly excited to see it again. Its a film not for everyone. It is a different style of entertainment. Its one of those forgotten films due mainly because of its production, and all the destructive moments that went wrong in making this film. A comedy that is silly and hysterical and downright memorable in many ways.

Huge cast of great actors and actresses. This would be actor Marty Feldmans last film performance. Feldman was a legend, an icon and a brilliant performer. He was able to create the many laughs that many movie's detailed. He was a master at his craft and always held the watcher. He owned every part he ever did, and Gilbert in Yellowbeard is no different. He is most famous for playing in Young Frankenstein, but he was so much more than that, and Yellowbeard is one of those films that expresses that reality. Marty was only 48 years old when he had heart attack that took his life. It was during the making of Yellowbeard that his untimely death happened. He was one of the greatest comedies/actors to ever grace cinema. He knew his parts and created those memories of perfection in this art form.

Sadly what hurt Yellowbeard was its funding? It took forever just to complete the film due to its many changes in development and scripts and yes Martys death. There was delay, after delay and changing of many actors in the lead. The film seemed doomed from the start.

Most of the critics hated this movie and even the actors spoke vocal about. It was a doomed film during its time. Whatever the case is, I still enjoy this movie, mainly for its amazing dynamite cast. Starring some of the greats such as, Graham Chapman, Peter Boyle, Peter Cook, Eric Idle, Cheech and Chong, John Cleese, a powerhouse of comedy legends. I don't think this movie is great, but I don't think is horrible as some have stated. I think its one of those movies thats a required taste. I think a certain group of movie persons, will get this film. I was entertained with all its over the top goofiness and mix of humor once again seeing it.

My husband. the Bounty shipwright, was offered s part as a a pirate, but turned it down to stay home with his kids for the holidays. Hi always wished he'd gone, but only bought the movie to see old friends.
It's not a bad movie, but not great. I suppose, if you are a Monty Python fan, you will enjoy. I just found some scenes rather gross and stupid.
However, in this movie, as in the 1962 'Mutiny on the Bounty' and the second 'Pirates of the Caribbean' as well as Charlton heston's ""\'Treasue Island' the Bounty lives on! You can see where my heart lies. Guess I just don't have the right sense of humor.",1426982400,2,860,4.314814814814815

This doesn't happen in the movie at all, so I have no idea what this reviewer is talking about. I suspect that many reviews are written by people who have someone else watch the movie and then ask them what happened.

Despite that, Graham Chapman gives one of his best performances ever as Yellowbeard. While not as LOL funny as a true Monty Python film, this stands up as a great watch, especially for the various cameos (watch for David Bowie)",1375488000,,675,4.760683760683761
761066,5,6303998267,"This movie, like Casablanca, has lines that are memorable and come to mind in daily life at odd times in a funny way.  ""You'll have to kill Me before I die!""  or ""Ahhh, Prison has reformed him!""  (in the movie in reference to Yellowbeard (aka Graham Chapman) supposedly raping with his clothes on since he used to ""take them off in the old days"" as Madeline Kahn puts it.  Something like this could fall flat on it's face with boorishness, but done by masters of comedy, they spin gold with hay.

For me, like many British comedies, it gets funnier the more you watch it the first few times, and holds it's charm long afterwards.  I've had friends watch it the first time not thinking much of it.  Then giggling a few times the next 2-3 times.  Then belting out laughing the 5th+ time.  It's a movie that has ""in"" jokes that you become a part of with time.

This movie is a mixture of cast members from ""Young Frankenstein"", Cheech & Chong, and a few Monty Python members.  The screenplay writing is quite rash.  ""I'll pin your tits to the table""  or ""It can't have been you, I'm sure I killed the last one I raped"".  What makes these lines even remotely funny is a normally stoic Graham Chapman delivers a rare outrageous performance and delivers them with rare gift of phrasing and timing.  Such a natural talent.

It gets poor ratings on IMDB and from Ebert, and even Cleese supposedly said it's ""one of the worst 5 movies ever made"" but I have always had a bizarre sense of humor and for me it's my favorite comedy.  Pirates, Sexual Humour, outrageousness, and for once, a Pythonish skit with an actual plot!

761334,3,6303998267,"Do not be fooled by the presence of a few actors from the Monty Python group. Do not be fooled by the presence of the other ""name"" actors, e.g., James Mason and Marty Feldman. YELLOWBEARD is more like television episode of a slapstick soap opera show, and less like a full-length film shown at your local cinema complex. Most of this movie has the tone of a typical THREE STOOGES movie, with its mild slapstick, repeated acts of bloodless violence, and a plot that often seems directionless. On the plus side, much of the film takes place on a real sailing ship, dating from the days when England and Spain were at odds with each other. Moreover, also on the plus side are the abundant period costumes, and period street scenes.

The movie contains many amusing stand-alone scenes, for example, we see a man walking on stilts, as part of the background of a scene. Another example, of a stand-alone scene, is where one of characters, an older man, encounters a small girl, about 7 years old. She is a street vendor. The man confers briefly, and then kicks her, sending her tumbling down a flight of stairs. (It is my understanding that this is the same type of humor used by W.C.Fields.) Another stand-alone scene, is where one of the sailors aboard a ship, as a form of punishment, has his feet nailed to the wooden deck of the sailing ship. The sailor with spikes in his feet is shown not to be in any particular pain -- he patiently waits his release later on in the movie when the spikes are removed.

The overall plot concerns the pirate Yellowbeard, and the only existing copy of his treasure map, which happens to take the form of a tattoo on the scalp of his son. His son is a handsome man in his 20s.

But the action in YELLOWBEARD mainly takes the form of little snippets of action, or of dialogue, which mainly serve the function of occupying time. YELLOWBEARD is more like an episode of a television soap opera, and less like a feature film of the type shown in theaters.

Where is the viewer to turn, where the viewer is interested in a decent movie featuring sailing ships? There are many excellent sailing movies, for example, TINTIN (released in December 2011), MASTER AND COMMANDER, MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY (e.g., the version with Mel Gibson), MOBY DICK starring Gregory Peck, and the black and white film, BILLY BUDD.

And where is the viewer to turn, where the viewer is seeking a decent Monty Python movie taking place in medieval times? In my opinion, the viewer should first consider MONTY PYTHON AND THE HOLY GRAIL (one of the all-time-great films in the history of cinema), and then consider THE ADVENTURES OF BARON VON MUNCHAUSEN (a fascinating fantasy film, not a comedy).",1324684800,,2695,4.594594594594595

The film brings together the Goons (via Spike Milligan); Beyond the Fringe (Peter Cook, who was also the co-scenarist); the Pythons (Graham Chapman, who plays the lead and cowrote the script, Eric Idle, and John Cleese, who is terrific as ""Blind Pew""), the Mel Brooks stock company (Madeline Kahn--who's great!--Peter Boyle, and Kenneth Mars), Cheech and Chong (the latter of whom for some reason does a Daffy Duck immitation), and Marty Feldman, who bridges all groups (and who tragically died during the filming).  Add to this lineup legit British actors James Mason, Michael Hordern and Beryl Reid, and a host of familiar face cameos, including Peter Bull, Bernard Fox, Ferdy Mayne, and David Bowie, and you have one of the most incredible casts of all time!  (Only the Carry-Ons were left out.) Anchoring it all is Martin Hewitt, who at the time was the cinema-heartthrob-dejour and as such was Dangerfielded by all the critics, but who is really very good in the Jim Hawkins-surrogate role.  The film is consistently funny and batty as hell, fueled by that bizarre, rather subtle and surreal British humor.  It's not perfect (director Mel Damski's staging of gags miss the mark as often as they hit it), but the combined efforts of Kahn, Feldman, Cook, Cleese, Idle and Mason are more than worth the price.  One consideration for parents:  PG in 1983 meant something quite different than PG today.  These days PG signifies an animated Disney film, but ""Yellowbeard"" contains enough bare boobies, raw language and suggestive dialogue as to qualify for a modern soft-R.",1242172800,,1761,5.090277777777778

Ruthless pirate Yellowbeard (Graham Chapman) discovers that his son Dan (Martin Hewitt), on whose head he'd tatooed the map to his treasure, is an intellectual. Everyone from the Navy to his old crew is on a race to find the treasure, leading to the classic ""stagger, stagger, crawl"" directions.

Madeline is in her usual hilarious form as Dan's mother, and Cheech & Chong outdo themselves in silliness as El Segundo and El Nebuloso, respectively. In fact, all the vast cast of comedic actors seem to be just as amusing as usual.

So I'm not sure why it fell flat for me. Look through my movie reviews--I love silly and cheesy. The all-star cast should have done the trick, and certainly most people seem to think it worked. I think it was the plot, of which there wasn't much.

I love silly, but I need there to be a point to it. Otherwise, it's just a bunch of people running around doing silly things, and that's entertaining for a while, but then it just gets boring.

I am glad I saw it, if only so I can repeat and paraphrase those treasure map directions ad nauseum. I just would have been happier if I'd rented it rather than purchasing it.

As for the son whose gift it was, he got impatient with it before I did. I think that's because he wasn't as familiar with the all-star cast, and thus wasn't as willing as I was to give them the benefit of the doubt at the beginning... at least I think he did. He's 12.

Well, either my memory is going or things just seemed funnier 25 years ago.  The plot is paper thin, the story is choppy, the acting is bad.

The plot:  A gruesome pirate (""I killed 500 men by the time I was 20"") escapes from prison after 20 years to reclaim his hidden treasure.  His son, a doctor, and a lordly-type go with him.  Chasing after him are the british royal navy and some of his former pirate associates.

The good:  Madeline Kahn, John Cleese, Eric Idle.  Madeline Kahn's over the top english accent is funny, and the way she gets the British Navy (including Eric Idle) to follow her ""recollection"" of where the treasure is hidden is hilarious.  John Cleese plays a fantastic blind man, and Eric Idle is, well, Eric Idle.  (Nudge, Nudge, Wink, Wink.  Say no more)

The bad:  Everything else.  I don't remember this movie being so bad.  Graham Chapman has the ability to make this a great movie, but his acting is so horrible that it just isn't believable.  His prison escape is just awful, his directions to the treasure aren't real, and the fight scenes are deplorable.

Overall:  Avoid this movie like the plague.  In fact, I'd rather have the plague.

He's killed many and has a distinctive smell as well. He's also buried his treasure that England wants to get a hold of. Out of all of Yellowbeards conquests (both women and on the high sees), he is arrested and charged with tax evasion. The English allow him to escape so that they can follow him and grab his treasure that he hid on a Caribbean island.

Along the way, he catches up with his wife played by Madeline Kahn and finds out he has a son. What Yellowbeard has to watch, is his old former mate, Mr. Moon played by the great actor, Peter Boyle whos sidekick was the lengendary Marty Feldman (Igor pronounced Eye-gor from Young Frakenstein). Who will find the treasure first, Yellowbeard, Mr. Moon and his crew, or Commander Clement (Eric Idle) and the Royal Navy?

The acting is funny as well as a small tidbit of one famous musician. The shark who was suppose to scare Mrs. Yellowbeard into telling Commander Clement where the treasure is, was none of than, David Bowie.

761676,3,6303998267,"Graham Chapman was a member of the classic comedy gang Monty Python, so it's not too surprising that ""Yellowbeard"" plays out like the world's longest Python skit -- tasteless, hilarious, and full of clinically insane characters. It doesn't have much of a plot, but the A-grade comedy actors make up for that much of the time.

Raping/pillaging pirate Yellowbeard (Chapman) has been in prison for twenty years for tax evasion. But since he's never even hinted where his treasure is, Navy Commander Clement (Eric Idle) pretends to add a hundred-forty years onto his sentence, hoping that he'll escape and lead them to the treasure. He does escape, but discovers that his tarty wife (Madeleine Kahn) has transferred his treasure map onto the head of her (and probably his) son Dan (Martin Hewitt).

After trying to decapitate Dan, Yellowbeard agrees to go on an adventure for the treasure, along with a scholarly doctor and an absentminded peer. Only the three of them get kidnapped by a press gang, and so Yellowbeard follows them on board, intent on raping, pillaging, mutiny, and getting back the treasure he took from the Spaniards (Cheech and Chong).

Yeah, it's a pretty thin plot -- the second half has basically no plot at all. But somehow it doesn't really interfere with the enjoyment of the story, especially since the cast is pure comic gold. Heck, it contains half of Monty Python --really, what higher compliment can you pay it than that?

The whole hijinks-on-the-way-to-treasure gets kind of muddled, as does the revenge of Yellowbeard's ex-first-mate. So Chapman and David Sherlock load on the mildly offensive comedy, including a bunch of sailors trying to smuggle prostitutes on board, and kindly Lord Lambourn constantly forgetting who other people are and what they're doing.

The dialogue is even better -- wonderfully weird, sometimes sick (""Look, if you cut my head off it'll start to putrify!"" ""Do what?"" ""Putrify, go rotten!"" ""Yeah, it would ooze a bit, heads do. But I could live with it!""). Sometimes the humor is horribly punny, such as one exchange between Idle and John Cleese: ""I may be blind, but I have acute 'earing."" ""I don't care about your jewelry!""

Unsurprisingly, Chapman rules this with his wild-eyed, bloodthirsty, bawdy pirate -- it seems like a a Python character who never made it to the screen. Yellowbeard is great fun, and Chapman has two of his Python pals as well -- Idle as a perpetually frustrated Navy commander, and Cleese as a blind beggar with hearing that should count as a superpower.

Cheech and Chong make some cameos as greedy Spaniards as well, and Peter Cook has an endearing turn as the absentminded Lambourn. As if that wasn't enough, two of Mel Brooks' favorites are on here -- Madeleine Kahn as Yellowbeard's tarty, untruthful wife (""The afterplay was on the rough side, but not fatal, dear""), and Marty Feldman as a creepy little pirate spy. Sadly Feldman died on the last day of this shoot.

""Yellowbeard"" is kinda lacking in plot, but it almost makes up for that with a hilarious, slightly demented cast of classic comedy actors, and plenty of quotables. Definitely worth seeing.",1177718400,7,3147,4.935727788279773

Also present are other notables like Cheech and CHong, Marty Feldman, James Mason and Madeline Kahn. They all come together for a great comedy if one is prepared at the outset not to take it too seriously.

It is the reign of Queen Ann and the notorious pirate, Yellowbeard, has been locked up for 20 years. Everyone wants to know where his treasure is and a scheme is hatched to find it. A queen's officer comes by the prison to inform him that back when he was sentenced, nobody was really expected to survive the horrid conditions of prison for 20 years. To make up for the mistake, his sentence is changed to life. Naturally, this hacks off the pirate who immediately breaks heads and breaks out. Then the chase is on as diverse interests try to pursue him and find the treasure.

In fact if they spent any less effort the box would have been plain white with the title on it in New Courier and the disc itself would have had no title on it at all.

Yellowbeard is Graham Chapman's fierce and mighty captain in this classic seafaring movie set in the golden age of piracy. Chapman -- best known for his work with Monty Python's Flying Circus, particularly as Brian in ""Life of Brian"" and Arthur in ""The Holy Grail"" -- chews scenery with such gusto you expect him to bite through ship's planks and maybe a palm tree or two. He is hail and hearty, greedy to a fault and ruthless in his pursuit of enough Spanish gold to make him the richest man in the world.

The story is simple but fun, and the cast is pure comedic delight, including Tommy Chong, Cheech Marin, Madeline Kahn, Peter Cook, Michael Hordern, Eric Idle, Peter Boyle, John Cleese and Marty Feldman. Chapman in particular roars through the movie with bloodthirsty enthusiasm; the man was a true comic genius.

This movie is mostly about silliness and meaningless fun, with only a thin thread of a plot holding it together. Critics who dismiss it as nonsense miss the point. It's rough and unpolished, and even funnier for it. ""Yellowbeard"" is a laugh riot, and it deserves to be pulled from the shelf and enjoyed at least once each year.

expert comedic timing on the part of everyone involved makes this ensemble flick more than its parts. i did not pay the asking price approaching $100 for a VHS a few years ago because i at least had a poor bootleg, and as all things VHS i knew even a so-called 'new' copy would deteriorate as often as i would watch it.

Feldman died in Mayheeco before this was finished, hence the disjointed ending, but he was wonderful while he lasted.

7859105,3,6303998267,not as funny as when we saw it the first time years ago.  That said .  Wonderful slapstick comedy...we just got old...bummer,1517097600,,124,4.590909090909091

7859107,4,6303998267,"The greatest pirate movie comedy ever.  Some don't like it, but with an ensemble including Peter Boyle & Madeline Kahn, on loan from Mel Brooks' troupe, Pythons John Cleese and Eric Idle, British comedy icons Peter Cook and Marty Feldman, and Cheech & Chong, our star Graham Chapman (The Life Of Brian, The Holy Grail) can display all the wackiness available.  What's not to like? The young man who plays Yellowbeard's son is rather uninteresting.  That's about it.",1515456000,,465,4.935897435897436
7859108,5,6303998267,"One of the most hilarious, raunchy, and crazy pirate movies ever made, and just a hilarious movie in general. And if you like Monty Python you will like Yellowbeard even better with several Monty Python stars as well as Cheech and Chong. Highly recommended.",1513123200,,257,4.863636363636363
