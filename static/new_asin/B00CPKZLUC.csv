5732280,1,B00CPKZLUC,I recently rented this movie and I had to stop it before it put me to sleep. Incredible overacting with a couple of severe drama queens who screamed their way through the movie. I totally disliked the constant screeching & screaming of the 2 female lead actors. This movie was so poorly done I would NEVER recommend to ANY of my friends :(  A total waste of time & $$ so don't bother.,1372550400,6,384,4.260273972602739

this simple story correctly you move one point to the next with no logical direction Jean claud van damme should have ran away from these amatuers this worst than any other low budget film i have watched please do not waste your money

5732283,1,B00CPKZLUC,It is by far the worst Jean Claude van damme movie (if u could even call it that because he is barely in it) I am a die hard fan so I'd buy it purely for the collectible aspect but apart from that don't waste your time and money cause this film is terrible!,1371081600,15,257,3.7777777777777777
5732284,2,B00CPKZLUC,"I bought this Movie a couple of months ago,from england. (It's called U.F.O over there)
The cover looked promising, but this must be the worst movie Van Damme have ever been in.
There is a few good looking scenes at the end, but for the most part it sucks! To have Van Damme's
name at the top of the cover is totally misleading, he is only in the movie for about 10-15 minutes!!
The Movie itself is about a bunch of people trying to avoid aliens, and to stay alive.
But the alien storyline, feels like a sideplot, most of the story is about fleeing, running and hiding.
Seriously, do not buy this movie.

5732309,2,B00CPKZLUC,"Bad movie. It had some decent moments towards the beginning, but I couldn't get passed the acting. Some of it was good, but Bianca Bree was awful. I am pretty sure Jean Claude made a deal with the studio to show up for a few minutes if they cast his daughter as a leading role. I could never really immerse myself in any scene because the reactions to each situation were so unbelievable. I am a sucker for alien movies and pretty much auto-5 star all of them, but this was too much even for my huge bias. Not the worst movie I've ever seen, but probably the worst I've seen in the last three or four years.",1433203200,,607,4.1525423728813555

There aren't any great answers or revelations its just a movie Im not sure what these critics expect out of these types of films.

The characters acted so irrationally that, toward the end, I was rooting for  the bad guys! Throughout the movie, humans were fighting each other for so many inane, childish things that I was beginning to suspect that the script was written by a 12-year-old.

5732327,2,B00CPKZLUC,"Low budget UK( titled UFO in Britain) yarn follows a small group of friends(some exmilitary)trying to prepare for and survive an upcoming alien invasion.  At first the movie has the actual feel of realism but later slips into a confused and complicated plot, with unanswered questions at its conclusion.  It does portray well how people freak out when electric power is down and when food and supplies are scarce.  Van Damme appears near the end of the film to try to explain the event that's been in the works for decades.  In the end he's not very relevent!  I guess he adds star power draw to the otherwise unknown Brit cast.  What special effects there are, are of the CGI video game quality.  Ultimately there are some good ideas that just didn't come off well.  Rent, don't buy!",1410480000,,784,4.630434782608695

5732330,1,B00CPKZLUC,This has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The people that were part of the making of this movie should be looking for another line of work.,1407801600,,155,3.84375
5732331,3,B00CPKZLUC,"This is the latest offering from Redbox. Originally titled ""UFO"" this film follows a group of five young adults who currently are located in one household. The opening of the film appeals to people with ADD as multiple subplots are flashed across the scene, including one with George (Jean-Claude Van Damme) which seems to be an after thought.

As aliens come to earth, the action is focused all on this one group with alien special effects being light until the end when the CG guys take over the film.

I accidentally clicked on the director's commentary and saw Dominic Burns. He looks like he was a kid who spent his time on comic books, video games, and getting his lunch money taken away. Indeed this is the type of film I would expect from someone like that operating on a budget, using a line like, ""Being a controller short of a Play Station.""

Once we get past the ADD opening, the film centers into some character build-up until the alien ship appears. At this point the film can't get over its low budget constraints as our same group of humans struggle. A subplot showing London command or perhaps the aliens themselves inside their ship would have been a welcomed change. Instead of  flipping scenes every 10 seconds in the beginning, save some for the end.

Simon Phillips  does his typical good job and should have been billed as the star instead of Van Damme who doesn't appear until late in the film and that is to just supply us with an explanation.. which would have been better if the aliens had done it themselves.

5732332,1,B00CPKZLUC,"I'm giving this one star because there is no way to give it less.  It had no real beginning, no real end, and the middle was mish-mash of unconnected nonsense and gratuitous violence.  It was plot-less,  incoherent, poorly acted, and those were its good points.  It was worse than The Witch Who Stole The Sun (my old least favorite), made Plan Nine From Outer Space look like an excellent movie and The Attack of the Killer Tomatoes come across like Academy Award material.",1404518400,,473,4.662650602409639
5732333,1,B00CPKZLUC,"Aliens invade the Earth in Alien Uprising (alternate title being more misleading U.F.O.), but you are not going to see much of them. What you are going to see instead is a group of young men and women yelling and bickering to each other. And Jean-Claude Van Damme? Yes, he is here in an extended cameo role, but as to his action, there is little to see.

Jean-Claude Van Dammes daughter Bianca Bree and Pierce Brosnans son Sean Brosnan are the stars of this sci-fi action film without much action. It is clear from the onset that the film is going to be boring, with a lengthy nightclub scene that never ends, and those irritating characters we really don't care.

And it is boring. The camera keeps moving busily, trying to cover up the fact there is not much to see. This is not a so-bad-it's-good movie. It is just bad.",1399939200,,822,4.437086092715232
5732334,1,B00CPKZLUC,"The blame for which I lay at the director's feet. A scene which should have been 30 seconds lasts 3 minutes. I've fast forwarded through a death scene before. You know those SNL skits that go on too long and are funny only to the writers? Cut 30 minutes from this film and you'll have a better piece of work. I feel so bad for the actors. Each seemed capable. Stuck in this horribly paced dud, they cannot be proud to have been in the finished product. A Van Damme? Bela Lugosi in an Ed Wood film. A crying shame.",1397433600,,513,4.14
5732345,3,B00CPKZLUC,This is how I understood the movie: the story was intriguing. The story does not start with the arrival of an Alien ship. Years earlier the Aliens arrive on Earth and start taking over important government positions. Van Damme is the head of an elite unit trained to identify and track down these Aliens. In the first scene of the movie: a young man picks up what he thinks is a Hot Date. His pick up is a female Alien looking Van Damme. The young man was once in his elite unit. The next scenes portray chaos after a large Alien Ship is sighted stationed over the country. This reminds me of news footage I saw after Hurricane Katrina hit New Orleans. The young man does hook up with Van Damme and the Aliens know where to find him. Aliens Win! The last scenes: a second fleet of Aliens arrive. There is a war in the sky between the two Alien forces. This is like the old black and white westerns I watched as a child. The cavalry shows up after the Indians have already massacred the wagon train. A good watch once you figure out the story and can follow it through all the twists and turns.,1395446400,2,1093,4.259615384615385
5732346,1,B00CPKZLUC,"and that's exactly what is wrong with it.

 It didn't hardly make any sense and the plot contradicts itself. So many things occur in the film that are never answered at all. Not to mention that the film is just one long dubstep sound track that really does get annoying after the opening scene. Seems like they were writing one story then decided to change it because they knew the original idea sucked but then realized they didn't have the budget to make the new changes work, so they just stuck with what they had and went for it. There's barely any ""aliens"" in this movie. Just CGI garbage that loops over and over in the background and it look incredibly faked because you can tell it's a looping CGI image as no one reacts to it at all.

Then there's how everyone reacts to what is going on. Okay, a giant alien space ship just landed and you think people would be going completely nuts and running for their lives in complete fear but instead they just walk around like it's Sunday afternoon. I've seen bigger reactions to black Friday at Walmart. Then when the aliens finally start attacking and the only logical person in the movie (the neighbor) who is scared ----less (finally a real reaction to the aliens) tells them to run as he tries to escape they all just decide to go back inside the house.

If there ever was an unnecessary alien movie this is indeed it. Then after some pointless scene where the group breaks off to find bullets we're introduced to the biggest plot hole. We're we see the guys new found love starts acting a bit strange. I'll just explain this part since none of the movie makes sense anyhow. At first we see the girl content on helping a family of people trapped in a car. Then we see her stand by as she watches her new boyfriend almost have his life ended as she steps in at the last final moment to save his life and she goes on to talk about how she doesn't wish to kill or hurt anyone she then goes on and later blows his head off like he had dandruff or something while attacking 2 other people in the process and taking a hostage with her. This is just how little sense the movie makes. What also doesn't make sense is that the aliens have a mark on their legs so the the girl and the guy go into the room for her to take her clothes off so he can see if she has the alien symbol on her. Okay yeah that's a fine idea except it's like the movie forgot that he has already scene her completely naked because they had sex less than 24 hours ago where we watched her taking off all her clothes. Okay did the movie forget that? Also this guy had sex with an alien how did he not tell that something was wrong?

The other major plot disaster is the ending. Apparently there's supposed to be two alien groups fighting each other for control of earth. One that looks humanoid and I'm guessing one that doesn't since the glimpse we see of an alien with a girls camera phone obviously isn't human (that scene is also never brought up again). So you're left wondering what even happened. I thought maybe there were two alien clone races myself but then why would the girl hesitate to attack the other alien humanoid, why would they be at the same club, and why would she seem upset for having to kill him, and even more importantly why would they have the same symbol if they were not of the same group? So we end the movie watching these two alien races fight each other in space while a TV broadcast comes on after the power is restored while a message saying earths forces had fought off the invaders is displayed. This of course is all after this long attempted rape scene and love confession while in the middle of escaping an alien battle.

This was one ending that made no sense and came out of no where. I guess watching this you could put together a better logical ending yourself but this brainless movie is not worth the effort. It doesn't make sense because the story is all over the place. I tried to figure out the producer wanted us to know that the humanoid aliens were there to protect the humans and had to show themselves as they fought off the bad aliens and when they defeated them they decided to cover up by saying that earths forces defeated the aliens so the good aliens could go back to spying on humans because I'm sure no one realized that earths forces don't have flying spaceship fighter jets yet and they also didn't realize there were 2 different aliens just like the rest of us watching this movie.

This movie was so bad it should have never been released. as for Jean Claude Van Damme I guess he's only in this because his daughter is in this movie playing a lead role. This movie was a waste of Van Damme and Van Damme should have taught his daughter some karate moves and that spinning kick thing so she could star in her own films without having to drag him into it just to make it worth watching.",1394582400,7,4869,4.303162486368593
5732347,2,B00CPKZLUC,"I had this movie streaming on my Samsung television (review, 26 Dec).  The ONLY thing going for it was the color looked good on the TV.

Yes, Van Damme's in it but there seems to be no logical reason why he should be.

As for the guy  who said he could have done something more important, he could have written and read Amazon reviews like I did!",1394323200,,346,4.119402985074627
5732348,1,B00CPKZLUC,"movie is why synonyms for ""awful"" exist. What is billed as an alien invasion movie attempts, rather poorly, to be a psychological thriller that thinks it's going to be clever by tying all the flash forwards (read: loose ends) together at the end. Problem is (well, there are lots of problems), the flash forwards are ultimately meaningless. Worse, when it comes to apocalyptic invasions, the audience needs someone to root for, and none of the characters here qualify. The overly long night club scene and subsequent sex scene do nothing to endear us to these characters, which is particularly criminal when you consider that the movie begins with these scenes. Nor do we ever get to see the aliens, having to settle for them in human disguise, presumably because the director wasted his budget on the two shots of an alien mothership hovering over town. Finally, the climactic sequence at the barn is a headscratcher; did other alien space ships come in to save the day or were they our own aircraft? The SFX are so bad it's hard to tell. All the lens flares, tricky camera angles, English accents, two Van Dammes, and fist fights out of left field can't save this one. Here's hoping we're invaded by belligerent aliens before a sequel is made.",1392508800,,1245,4.768518518518518
5732349,2,B00CPKZLUC,"Alien Uprising(released Dec/12),a re title from its original name U.F.O.,stars,among others,Bianca Bree,Sean Brosnan,Simon Philips and Jean-Claude Van Damme. This title is under the general release umbrella of Phase Four films,the same company that brought us such OSCAR ""contenders"" as Alien Armageddon and BloodRayne:The Third Reich. This film then fits right in with that companie's general dynamic and raison d'etre. Alien Uprising is yet another turkey that should give the aliens in this movie cause to invade. Any race that would create/inflict such a film into the universe,deserves extinction.
The story,for what it is,finds a group of four friends,three guys and a girl,out night clubbing in England. As the plot progresses we are privy to quick intercut scenes from the future that foretell the dire path they are on. One of the guys proposes to the girl who is his long time love and she accepts. One of the other guys brings home a girl he picked up at the bar. Needless to say,both guys get lucky. They wake up the next day and the power is out in a wide area. In fact a next door neighbour heads south to meet up with his wife who works in a branch of the military. He says he will relay any info about the power outage when he gets back.
The next day they are awakened by the sound of the house trembling. They rush outside to see a huge UFO hovering above the town. Thinking the worst(invasion)they rush down to a grocery store for supplies. While there a small riot breaks out,and one of the guys is forced to draw his weapon on two thugs who attempt to take their goods. They arrive back home and the guy and the girl he picked head out to his place to get more ammo for his gun. Along the way they save a girl from a car wreck and take her to get medical attention. They find a pharmacy guarded by a cop. A struggle ensues between the guy and the cop,with the cop eventually being killed by his girl friend. We are shown a purple mark on the dead cops leg afterwards.
Back at the house the two guys leave to steal a car,leaving the girl behind alone. However aliens soon enter the house and she is forced to flee. Outside an alien probe is just about to waste her when two soldiers destroy the probe. As they stand talking,the two guys show back up,unable to get a car,and the other one with his girlfriend. When a tramp sneaks up and grabs one of the soldiers sidearms,the soldiers are forced to shoot him. Unfortunately one of the guys is killed in the process. The remainder then drive to an ex black ops military man's house(Van Damme).He informs the group that he has a piece of alien technology and that he and his military bosses have for years suspected alien infiltrators,that look and talk like us. The only way of telling them from humans is a purple mark. The little girl then asks:""Like the one on the policeman?"".The ex ops man tells them to stick with only people they know. They all turn and look at the girlfriend  the guy picked up two nights before. The military guys want to search her but her boyfriend agrees to do it. Alone in the room she shoots him dead. The others come in and she manages to overpower them all and escape outside,where a probe beams her inside of it. More probes come and as the ex black ops man offers up his piece of alien technology to them,he is disintegrated. As the rest wait to be killed,suddenly other UFOs come out of the sky and attack the alien UFOs. Back inside the house with just the little girl,one of the guys, a military man left alive,and the other girl,the now apparent alien girl who was beamed into the probe,is now seen broadcasting on TV.She is saying the earth people have won the war and to remain inside. Just then an armed assault team enters the house saying there is a little girl that can identify them. The team then kills the rest of the survivors. Fade to black.
The film doesn't give out with the answers and one is kind of left to fend for themselves,plot wise. The different attacking UFOs near the end is a puzzler. One can assume,though this is guessing,that they are earth made technology and that the military has been secretly waiting for just such an invasion to use them. The film goes along slowly but surely until the scene where they try and get the little girl into the pharmacy for some medical supplies. The producers seemed to have a lot invested in the fight scene that takes place. It goes on far too long,and the film thereafter seems to drag terribly. Jean Claude Van Damme's appearance is token at best,but he makes the best of what he has to do. He appears as this black ops guy who lives by himself. We first see him on the ground looking up from underneath a soldiers legs with a shotgun.""And your name is?"".And of course Van Damme gets to do some of his legendary box kicking with his own daughter Bianca Bree. However you almost laugh when Van Damme gets killed. Just before the alien probe disintegrates him he says""Oh S#$!"".It happens so quickly and is edited the same way,that I started to laugh a little when I saw it. Bianca,by the way,needs a LOT of more time on screen to develop some proper acting chops. Her brother seems to be doing fine,but she is FAR from a steady career in acting. How she got top billing is beyond me as her part,while not as limited in scope as her fathers,is truly one that goes in and out of scenes like a fly,and with limited lines. By the way the outer cover of this DVD,is a cheat. No man with such goggles,appears any where in this film.
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include a featurette and a trailer.
All in all another lame brained film,with a been-there done-that kind of plot;and done FAR better elsewhere. It uses cheesy and cheap S/FX,with that quick and supposedly edgy you-are-there camera work(ala The Blair Witch Project),and the plot gets quite ponderous and slow. Until this one gets into the $5.00 bin at Walmart,like the others from Phase Four I mentioned above,give it a pass.",1390348800,,6013,4.501372369624885
5732350,3,B00CPKZLUC,"As many have stated there are several plot holes in this movie with unresolved questions and an unresolved ""cliffhanger"" ending.

None of that should cross off the movie for you.  Classic books and awesome movies often have unresolved endings.  The Leo D. film, Inception, has a ""what the heck is the answer?"" ending and many consider it to be a fantastic film.  Personally, I hate unresolved endings.  I also hate ""we lose"" endings too.  Both of those are because I watch movies as a form of entertainment escapism and real life is full of unresolved questions (like ""Who shot JFK?"") so I don't want to have my escapism ruined with them.  Did the aliens kill all humans in the end as the gas station attendant theorized?  We don't know.

There are also plenty of unresolved plot elements.  Importantly, who initiated the attack, the first aliens, the human governments, or the second aliens?  We don't know for sure but from hints and clues fairly obviously littered throughout the movie, we are left with the suggestion that the aliens represented by ""Carrie"" were, initially at least, peaceful.  Carrie suggests to the station attendant that the aliens are peaceful ""explorers.""  She tells Michael that she is visiting England to ""learn about its culture and people.""  When their car is t-boned, she desperately wants to save the woman in the car crash, desperately wants to save the life of the man from the car crash despite the internal bleeding, in conjunction with no EMS, being a death sentence.  Carrie is offended and nearly hysterical when ""Michael"" performs a mercy killing on the man.  She then becomes insistent that they save the injured teenage girl in the car, taking her to a ""Chemist"" (""Pharmacy"" in U.S. speak) store where Michael can give her field medical treatment.  In the ensuing action-fight between the purple marked alien (the second aliens?) and Michael, Carrie is reluctant to help or intercede in the violence until it becomes clear that Michael has lost and will be murdered by the purple marked alien, at which time she kills the alien, evidencing both her distaste for the action and remarking that Michael is nothing but a ""cold blooded killer.""  While none of this is conclusive that the aliens which Carrie represents are truly peaceful, it's pretty compelling.  Nevertheless, it seems to be superficially at odds with Carrie murdering Michael at the farm and attacking the other survivors.  However, it seems to be more consistent with the idea that Carrie has now ""learned"" all she needs to know and has formed the opinion that humans are deadly, dangerous, and unworthy creatures.

This also seems to be consistent with film's ending wherein an Entry Team of human form aliens enters the farm and is given an order to execute the survivors.  That appears to be the thrust of the film.  It is a Social Commentary masquerading as a Sci Fi alien invasion action flick.  We find that humans are not to be trusted, are violent, and, again, unworthy.  All of the 4 major human characters (and most of the minor human characters) illustrate serious flaws and shortcomings under pressure.  Michael is aggressive, violent, engages in what Carrie believes to be unwarranted euthanasia, and admits to her that he was dishonorably discharged from the Army for an unspecified offense that involved him loosing his temper. Robin abandons his fiance to fight with bouncers throwing Michael and Vincent out of the night club.  Vincent is a drunk and an indecisive coward, having to be chivied into taking any action at all and is shown at the end to be an (attempted) rapist. Dana is selfish (at the grocery) and domineering, only showing humanity and heroics near then end when she saves Vincent twice (once before and once after he attempts to rape her) and insisting that the teen girl not have to witness an unconscious Vincent be killed by Kenny (none of which Carrie witnesses).  Soldiers Kenny and Sam are indiscriminately violent, murdering the homeless man, who was trying to warn the survivors of aliens in their mist, and jokingly enjoying firing weapons at alien craft. Carrie witnesses riots, theft, intimidation, threats and selfishness during the power outage and gathering at the grocery store.  This film was, at it's core, the same old ""humans suck"" social commentary so popular today.  Heavens, how I miss the classic Star Trek style Sci Fi which once quoted The Bard, ""What a piece of work is a man! How noble in reason, how infinite in faculty! In form and moving how express and admirable! In action how like an Angel! in apprehension how like a god! The beauty of the world! The paragon of animals!""

Some of the reviewers here are upset that the repeated theme of 24:36 was apparently not explained.  However, it was explained as fully as the purpose of Carrie's aliens.  Multiple times it was suggested that it was Bible verse.  The homeless man quoted part of the verse in question and Michael gave the Book: Matthew 24:36 - ""But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father.""  This is a Biblical reference to the End of Days and the destruction of the Earth.  Duh.  The aliens are destroying human civilization and the verse even has a reference to angels (non-human beings who descend from the heavens) as a freebie.  C'mon now.  It's not hard.

Why was Van-Damme in this flick?  I assume that he likes money and still needs to pay for food and stuff.  It's a job.  Get over it.  I haven't much cared for JCVD since I was a teenager anyway.  *HIS* acting was wooden.  But it always has been.  He has the emoting capacity of a stump.

The rest of the acting was OK.  Not bad.  But it wasn't Oscar quality acting either.  And Bianca Bree sure is easy on the eyes.

So was it a bad movie?  NO.  Categorically not.  Neither was it a movie that I particularly enjoyed.  I dislike Social Cometary movies, particularly when masquerading as Sci Fi (a problem I have with some Dr. Who) and I also dislike the open ended, unresolved, ending.  However, it does not deserve the criticisms that most reviewers here have given it.  So what if there are unanswered questions?  That's common in even ""good movies.""  And some of the ""unanswered questions"" are far less unanswered than many of the reviewers seemed to think.  I guess that was part of the problem.  You have to do a little bit of THINKING to ""get"" this movie and no one goes to an Alien Invasion Action Sci Fi flick looking for Of Mice and Men.",1389830400,12,6501,4.739750445632799
5732351,1,B00CPKZLUC,"Van Damme movies are usually bad but his cameo appearance in this was the best acting in the entire thing.  There were so many things in this movie that just did not make sense.  His name should not have headlined this, he was in the last 10 or 15 minutes of the movie.  I'm going back to see what the wacko's that gave this 5 stars had to say just for a laugh.  Luckily I watched on Netflix and didn't pay anything other than the time I will never get back.",1388188800,3,458,4.0

Power goes out, even cell phones, but cars work somehow. fight scenes last so long, there good actually, but are too drawn out, by far. aliens only have a tattoo that they are recognized by?  no green blood, yea ok. Van Dam is in it. WAY NOT ENOUGH. and has b quality lines to say. thats just dumb. we never know why they are here, what there plan is, and out of the blue more aliens show up to fight the bad aliens, but no explanation is ever given, no conclusion as to who wins the alien vs alien fight. and your left , well guessing would be a waste of time. in the end they bad aliens seem to win, but your not even sure of that cause there is a war in space over head. ??? if you connected the dots, filled in all the holes and re-wrote the script. it would be great. good actors and actresses.",1387929600,5,858,3.988372093023256

5732354,4,B00CPKZLUC,"So many negative reviews online about this movie. I'm going to thumb my nose at them.

Most complain that the movie doesn't seem to know what it's about, or that it can't decide what genre it's in or that some of it seems random and out of place, or that the special effects are bad or that the acting is less than...blah blah blah.

Here's my take: Just sit back and accept it, it is enjoyable to watch (AFTER THE FIRST TEN MINUTES--you have to stick with it). By the end, I was wondering what happened. The movie has some confusing bits, the acting, at points, is frustrating, the camera moving in a circle outside the supermarket made me dizzy, the special effects were puzzlingly bad (might have been intentional...not sure), but somehow...

I enjoyed it.

So give this one a try. It may not adhere to the usual formula or fit in the usual boxes. Square peg/round hole sort of thing...",1387756800,8,889,4.469135802469136
5732365,1,B00CPKZLUC,"I watched the whole thing, as I wanted to give it a chance.  i really did.  It's one of those movies that COULD have been could.  They could have built the excitement and suspense, but instead relied on cliches, overly dramatic music, and low-brow punching to attempt to dress it up.  Clunky dialog, flat acting, early 90's visual affects, and Van Dam (for some reason).  I'm really not sure what the whole point of the movie was?",1387238400,2,430,4.532467532467533

What was about to happen for the 45 minutes I tried to watch the movie made me mad. I finally had to turn it off. Jean Claude was in the movie less than a minute, the acting was horrible, the blonde was annoying, the script was, well, seemed written by a small childoverall just a really horrible movie.",1386979200,,466,4.188888888888889

The music at the beginning was third rate French Techno and the sex that followed was weaker than a 1970's soft core knock off. The characters were stereotypes to the max. AND, I'm still not sure how it ended.?????

Did we kill the aliens or did they kill us or did we kill our own--

Don't buy it- don't pay to see it- might be worth a free look/see down the line. But very disappointing.....really!",1379030400,3,469,4.379310344827586

When they begin to lose power and phone reception they cope with it and move on, until they notice something unimaginable. A huge UFO is floating in the sky and an invasion has begun. Going into this I had very low expectations. I know what your thinking, an alien movie starring Jean-Claude Van-Damme...how can you not be excited about that. I am not a fan of his but if you are I should tell you he is in it for about 10 minutes. On the other hand this movie was actually better then I was expecting. The quality wasn't as cheesy as I was expecting and to me this was a better version of Skyline...also with a better ending that that one as well. I'm not saying this is amazing and rush out and see it but in terms of the latest B movies that Van-Damme has been in this is one of the better ones. Overall, much better then I expected. If you liked Skyline then check this one out. I give it a B-.",1375574400,8,1002,4.065656565656566

I thought it was going to be your typical alien movie,  but instead it was a twist on an alien invasion where we end up questioning our peers.

It is strange and certainly not what I was thinking it would be at all. If you are looking for a unique b-rate movie for some different entertainment, take the time to watch this. If you want a blah Hollywood movie where everything happens as you expect, then you will hate this movie. Most Americans will hate this movie since we generally like mindless, fast paced and predictable movies where their favorite characters always miraculously make it in the end.

What was their mission ? What is the 'Radio tech"" ? Why was jean claude in the movie ? He was in for such a short time that It felt like he was in it just so we could see his face but his presence added ZERO to the story.. The meaning of ""24, 36"" was never explained yet it was introduced as a Key piece of information to the Plot.  Do you see where this is going ? Ultimately, I really feel I wasted an hour and change of my life with NO REWARD.  That's time I'll never get back... I could have spent that time doing something more productive and rewarding like : Picking nose hairs, Staring in a mirror, walking in circles...
