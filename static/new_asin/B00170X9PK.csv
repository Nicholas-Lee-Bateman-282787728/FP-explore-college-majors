8264504,4,B00170X9PK,"A informative DVD that speaks to one of America's most important, pivotal growth elements.  A young family could start a farm for little to no money west of the Appalachin Mountains back in the early 1800s.  Problem was exporting the family's labor and farm's output to the population centers back east.  Farm goods were transported over rough hewn roads of logs or rubble.  Four to six oxen pulled a farm wagon of 1 or 2 tons herded by one or two teamsters.  This was expensive and subject to highway men along the way.  The Erie Canal tyransported 90 tons with a pair of mules and a skinner.  This way was needed to connect the frontier beyond the Appalachians with the cities on the east coast.  Before the Erie canal, New York City was but one of many east coast port cities.  It is said that the investment made by the citizens of New York state, built New York City.  For it's day, it rivaled some of the worlds engineering marvels and literally began America's engineering education.  The first Erie canal connecting New York City to the Great Lakes began a canal building boom.  States west of the Appalachians then in turn, built canals connecting their interiors with Great Lakes and generated an American economic boon.  From these main feeder canals, smaller connecting canals individual industries were built.  This DVD details the magnitude of this undertaking as measured by the strength of farmers backs and time available from their mainstay of feeding their family from their farm.  The Erie escarpment was a tremendous obstacle overcome by dogged determination and recently developed nitroglcerin.  A must see for anyone wanting the details of this milestone in transportation that built America.",1364601600,,1715,4.923344947735192
