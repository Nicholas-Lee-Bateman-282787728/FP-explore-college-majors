4532370,1,B0052XI5HK,"The first was terrible, and this was somehow even worse. Do not waste your money on this terrible movie. You might as well buy random pieces of garbage, atleast then your house wouldn't smell as bad. This is just...no",1309564800,5,217,4.589743589743589
4532371,2,B0052XI5HK,"Sequels are sometimes good, but most times not.  This sequel is terrible.  I just bought the original ""Hoodwinked"" because I loved it and have seen it at least 3 or 4 times.  I have recommended it to many people.  When part ""Too"" came out, I saw it in the theater, I was so excited about it.  Man, was I blow away by how poor it was.  All the ineresting angles and approach of the original was gone... it was just another animated kids movie with straight-forward, predictable plot.  I recall chuckling a couple times... that is it.

I am sorry to give this such a low rating, but, to make up for that, I highly recommend you go buy the original Hoodwinked... you will be happy you did.  (Just try to resist the temptation to follow up the watching of that great movie with watching this sequel.)

Note:  I am a father of several small kids.  I hated Hoodwinked Too (as you can tell); but my kids liked it... so I give it two stars as the average of my 0 star rating and my kids 4 stars.  If you are just getting it for the kids, it could be worth it.",1309478400,55,1051,4.143564356435643

4532395,4,B0052XI5HK,"This is a sequel that did get to the big screen. Usually sequels to animated films go directly in video, but this was shown in the theater. The animation is an improvement to the original ""Hoodwinked"" with only some of the original voice cast coming back. Hayden Panettiere replace Anne Hathaway as Red Puckett, and new characters are added. I have to say that though this has been stomped on by a few reviewers, I actually liked this film. The plot is absurd and wacky, but still fun to watch, it even had a few laughs sprinkled here and there. The Hansel and Gretel characters, however, were a mistake -- that whole aspect was awkward. Verushka the Witch turning out to be a sympathetic character was a nice touch. But I wish there was more of Boingo the Bunny -- he had only one scene and he was tied up in prison somewhere. It was also surprising that the producers got Wayne Newton to the voice of the Harp -- that was actually very funny. Heidi Klum was an odd choice as a martial arts action hero. In the special features section of the DVD they had an interview with her and they show scenes that weren't used in the final cut. Patrick Warburton is always hysterical no matter what he does, always good to hear him. In the special features section he talks about how the Wolf grew as a character, going through changes in the film, becoming a better wolf.
  Red Puckett, as in the first film, has gigantic eyes that are distracting in the film. Also her cape seems to change length in different scenes. The film is a send up of spy movies, action films, and such such TV shows as Starsky and Hutch (using the same car in that TV series), and naturally an absurdist send up of countless martial arts films. The object sought, a recipe that gives people superpowers, is intentionally ridiculous. All that effort to get back a recipe? An action film for the Food Network. Just ludicrous! And Japheth the Goat gets dumped on too many times. I liked the extended gag of Red looking for what DCT stood for and all the things it can stand for.
  This is a film that is actually better than others have said. Too often any animated film that isn't Pixar gets trashed or ignored, when in fact Pixar films aren't really all that wonderful. This was made by Kanbar Entertainment, with facilities by Starz Animation and Bardel Animation, among others. And the animation holds up very well, with the rendering actually very good.",1474761600,,2424,4.502272727272727

Hoodwinked Too! however was really lacking the spirit and charm of the first and seemed like the writers were really straining at the gags here. The characters all felt flat, and even though the animation did seem a little bit improved the humor just wasn't there. The evil Hansel and Gretel weren't funny or even intimidating but really came across as irritating more than anything. The story elements all seemed tired and contrived, and honestly there weren't many laughs watching this one (even a repeat of the coffee gag just wasn't all that funny.)",1445990400,,711,4.884297520661157

A wicked witch [Joan Cusack] has abducted two innocent children, Hansel [Bill Hader] and Gretel [Amy Poehler], plus Nicky needs the whole Hoodwinked gang, especially with Red, Granny [Glenn Close], and the ever clueless Wolf [Patrick Warburton] and his over caffeinated little partner, Twitchy [Cory Edwards] for the search and rescue mission.

Andrew's Blu-ray Review: `Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil' was an obvious choice for a sequel treatment. But of course this computer animation is not to everyones taste, but I love it. Released at the turn of 2006, the computer animated comedy was the first hit of newly-formed The Weinstein Company. Grossing over $50 million domestically and $110 million worldwide on a reported $15 million production budget, it was one of the few clearly profitable films from The Weinstein Company had in their rough first years on their own. It received mixed reviews, but the public liked it and they should have, because its Rash monic take on the story of Little Red Riding Hood was clever and entertaining, comparable to the two Shrek movies that had been made by then.

Timing played a big part in the computer animated film's success and in the epic failure of this year's sequel, `Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil.' 2006 would see record output of theatrical animation. By opening on Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend, the original `Hoodwinked' preceded the CGI onslaught to come. At the time, fewer than two dozen computer-animated films had played in cinemas in American and Europe, starting with `Toy Story.' Computer animation seemed to be a fail-proof medium and every studio around pushed to release another animation film in it that year.

Computer animation has remained popular and lucrative. Five of the year's ten top-grossing films were computer-animated comedies. But the medium has come a long way from novelty status and sure-fire profitability. The average North American gross has dropped from $167 million in 2005 to $124 million right now, with many middling and low grosses cancelling out massive year ruling hits like `Shrek 2' and `Toy Story 3.' Certainly, the marketplace is much different these days than it was at the beginning of 2006. Though a beloved franchise like `Toy Story' could let eleven years pass between instalments to record-high demand, a computer animation like `Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil,' taking over five, violated a statute of limitations for a mildly popular animated family film. Children who had enjoyed `Hoodwinked' had either grown up or moved on and the film wasn't on the public's minds long after it hit home video entertainment.

`Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil' opens with white text on black screens, its first of a seemingly record three times crediting the voice cast, why, I don't know. The astute will notice that in the role of Red Riding Hood, Anne Hathaway has been replaced with the more available, affordable Hayden Panettiere. In addition, Kirk the woodsman, previously voiced by Jim Belushi, has been upgraded to Martin Short, although the part is little more than a cameo this time around. After those credits, a storybook and narration briefly recap the events of the first computer animation film.

The story begins with the covert agents of H.E.A. (Happily Ever After) working on a mission. Roly-poly siblings Hansel [Bill Hader] and Gretel [Amy Poehler] have been taken prisoner by a nefarious witch in a gingerbread house. Taking their orders from head frog Nicky Flippers [David Ogden Stiers], Granny Puckett [Glenn Close], The Big Bad Wolf [Patrick Warburton], and less important employees narrow in on the candy home. The rescue attempt is botched and Granny gets whisked away along with Verushka the witch [Joan Cusack], children, and house.

Such a development requires H.E.A. contacting Red Riding Hood, who for some reason is training in China (with scenes that feel lifted from Kung Fu Panda) with the Sisters of the Hood. It turns out that Verushka herself is a former Sister, who now demands the top secret, never-written, never-spoken ingredient of the order's most important confection, the Norwegian Black Forest Truffle, aka the Super Truffle, which grants its eater invincibility. All is not as it seems in Granny's captivity, where half our time is spent, the rest going to Red and Wolf's rescue efforts.

Twitchy the squirrel (screenwriter Cory Edwards) again pops up from time to time. Also returning in a cameo is the first film's unlikely villain Boingo the Bunny [Andy Dick]. New characters include a giant club owner [Brad Garrett], the Three Little Pigs (two-thirds of whom are voiced by Cheech and Chong), and a golden harp modelled after Jimmy Durante [Wayne Newton].

In tone, this comic mystery is not far from its predecessor. In success, though, it falls way slightly short and somewhere in between television advert and children's video game quality. The production values of the original computer animation, which was made by a team of twenty in a rented house in the Philippines, were lacking, but at least there was the screenplay's wit holding everything up. This one, produced by Canada's Starz Animation `Gnomeo & Juliet,' which has a great deal of wit and most of it is determined to fly completely over young heads and connect more with adults.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  `Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil' the results are to me very acceptable and totally extraordinary. But if you read other reviews they slate this computer animation with very negative reviews, well I think they are totally out of order, as to me this 3D Blu-ray is a stunning image sensation, obviously those negative people ought to get new 3D glasses, as they must be faulty. The film opens with a storybook lying flat on a table; there's an obvious sense of space from the table to the top of the book whether it's open or closed. The night time raid that follows squeezes out some perceptible depth, a rarity with blackened or very dark backgrounds. Longer shots with more complex animation and the overhead shot of the lounge where Jimmy Ten Strings performs, for instance and enjoys a very nice ""realistic"" scope and scale. A staircase seems to extend back into the screen in one shot, but the effect is somewhat lessened by the innate softness that characterizes the further steps. There are no real ""pop out of the screen"" moments; a missile shoots towards the audience at one point, but it hardly seems to penetrate the screen. All in all, this is a superior effective 3D image.

3D Blu-ray Audio Quality  `Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil' features a stunning 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio soundtrack that accompanies the aforementioned 2D only release. The clarity is brilliant, and has a completely lots of volume and energy at all reference levels. The heavier sound effects of an explosion, the roar of a jet engine, the zipping of a motorcycle are awesome, but the basic delivery in terms of directionality, spacing, and the like is great. Likewise, surround use is sporadic at best, and the track draws the audience into the film. On top of all that the dialogue is crisp and accurate as it flows from the centre channel while music enjoys a full front-half delivery. Make sure to crank up the volume with this one, especially a bit past your normal levels.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Music Video: I Can Do It Alone Featuring Hayden Panettiere [480i] [3:34] An Auto-Tuned non-diegetic number. Sweaty and suspendered, she sings while looking straight into the camera.

Music Video: You Know It Featuring Lavay Cole [480i] [3:02] It supposedly creatively turns a school library into a dance party. This end credits rap is a song I hope the Academy can remember through next winter not to be implemented.

Music Video: Perfect Two Featuring CEEJ [480i] [3:13] Finds the unknown teenager singing and strumming a guitar in a variety of locations, her red hooded sweatshirt and similarly colored other outfits an apparent nod to Red, who features in the occasional split-screen.

Special Feature: The Voices of Hoodwinked Too! [480i] [19:13] Individual voice cast members discuss their work on the film. Included are Hayden Panettiere [Red], Patrick Warburton [Wolf], Heidi Klum [Heidi], Wayne Newton [Jimmy 10 Strings] and David Ogden [Nicky Flippers].

Special Feature: Storyboards Sequences [480i] [4:29] Bridge and H.E.A. Invasion

Special Feature: Production Artwork [1080p]

Hoodwinked Too! Video Game Teasers [480i] [0:41] Red's Escape Mobile Game Teaser and Decoder Game Teaser.

Finally, this is a sequel computer animation film, which I found surprisingly entertaining which really works brilliantly, but as I said earlier, this computer animation is not liked by a lot of people, well I totally disagree with them, because Hood vs. Evil has the same low-tech computer design as the original, with lots of brilliant sarcastic humour, cleverness, and lots of joyous fun. Whether or not you liked the first computer animation film, and I know you will enjoy this one very much, which is worth seeing only to demonstrate the brilliant 3D animation. Starz and The Weinstein Company have put together a pretty nice package for the film, with a flawless feature presentation and a standard but satisfying half hour of bonuses. This 3D Blu-ray + DVD combo also carries a list price that is a brilliant low price and that is why it is well worth purchasing. So overall, I loved the first Hoodwink animation and eager to purchase this very soon and that is why I am so happy to have purchased this follow up and really enjoyed it and I am so pleased I now have this in my Blu-ray Collection. Highly Recommended!

Although we were bummed Anne Hathaway didn't play the voice of 'Red', there are returning voices/characters. Boingo the Bunny, Granny, the Wolf, Twitchy, and the Goat remain the same.  Also, Joan Cusack plays the voice of the witch, and does an amazing job--her cackling, wicked laugh is OUTRAGEOUS!  It might scare a younger set of kids, so, head's up to parents.  Like the first 'Hoodwinked', it's funny for kids while providing some good humor for adults, too.  If you like the first movie, this is worth watching/getting, even though it has a different twist.

It doesn't have the clever different character perspectives, etc.  but it was entertaining.  For the adults there are parodies of other movie characters and lot's of one liners.

Few of the main characters are hardly likable and others are nearly likable. Some might say a squirrel was a cool character, but I guess I've seen is somewhere before. It could be a rip off from other movies, because even the plot itself wasn't original. It's like I've seen it, nearly all of it, before. Therefore the plot is predictable, but not everywhere. The soundtrack was quite good and got better to the end. Overall I'dd give it 3.5 stars. It doesn't have a bad animation, but at least in one place, there were too many windmills and the background looked 'naked'. They could add more details to it and destroy at least half of those repeating windmills. The movie is watchable and some will like, while others not so much.

4532548,4,B0052XI5HK,"As adults, we loath kids movies. Sure, some people get into the Disney stuff, but for the most part, adults despise films that are made for kids and I am no exception. It takes a really good story and some clever writing for a PG film to appeal to adults as much as it does to kids, and it's virtually impossible to do this while still keeping the PG rating intact, but somehow the writers of Hoodwinked have accomplished this twice! The story really isn't important, it's geared toward kids and is very simple and predictable. What's not easy is keeping the adults awake, while the kids have the time of their lives. The writers accomplished this by throwing in parodies of classic adult films. Hoodwinked Too! has references to Goodfella, Die Hard, Silence of The Lambs, and a half a dozen other classic films, and it was those scenes that were the most fun. Also interesting to note, the voice of the wolf was done by Patrick Warburton, who does the voice of Joe Swanson on Family Guy, and it was really difficult for me to see the wolf as a totally different character. Hoodwinked and now it's sequel are nothing like Toy Story and aren't going to blow anyone away, but they are pretty good and while the kids are watching it, you'll find yourself getting in a few laughs as well. Hoodwinked Too! is a terrific family film with something for the whole family and is really the definition of what a family film should be.",1371168000,,1424,4.501930501930502
4532549,3,B0052XI5HK,"Life has gone on in the Enchanted Forest since 2006's enchanting ""Hoodwinked"" reimagined the Little Red Riding Hood fairy tale.  In ""Hoodwinked Too"", Red (voiced by Hayden Panettiere) is in training to become a Sister of the Hood, like her Granny before her.  Detective Nicky Flippers (David Ogden Stiers) has organized most of the remaining characters, including Granny (Glen Close), the Wolf (Patrick Warburton), and Twitchy the Squirrel (Corey Edwards) into the Happily Ever After Agency to chase bad guys.  When Hansel and Gretel are kidnapped, the agency rescue plan goes badly, and Granny goes missing.

Red will have to cut short her martial arts training in a Shaolin-like temple in the clouds to help rescue Granny and to save a secret recipe that makes its consumers invincible.  She will reluctantly partner with the Big Bad Wolf to face down an evil conspiracy that features a disgruntled witch, some gangster pigs, a scary-looking spider, and a couple of unexpected villains. Boingo the Evil Bunny returns for a superb cameo in full Hannibal Lector mode.

""Hoodwinked Too"" has some good moments, but it lacks the freshness and originality of the original movie.  The story tends to wander, while an otherwise healthy theme about working together gets overworked in an overlong movie.  Recommended as mildly entertaining.",1370563200,,1333,5.196261682242991

4532557,3,B0052XI5HK,"The first Hoodwinked, though nothing too revolutionary, made a name for itself in a very competitive industry on account of the fact that it, like Shrek before it, managed to walk the thin between classic fairy tale and pop culture sensibilities.  I wasn't overly enamored with the original, though appreciated a bit of the originality it contained especially considering it was done on a shoestring budget by a small company.

Naturally, as is the way of things in Hollywonk, a successful project deserves another and thus brings us to Hoodwinked Too! Hood Versus Evil, the 2011 animated feature film from the Weinstein Company.  Built on a reputed $30 million budget (roughly double that of the first film), Too! is 86-minutes long and wears an appropriate PG rating.

The story, or what passes for one here goes something like this:  Red (Hayden Panettiere), a member of the mysterious warrior order ""Sisters of the Hood"", is roped into service by the top-secret Happily Ever After Agency when Granny (Glenn Close) is kidnapped by a witch (Joan Cusack) during a failed rescue attempt of the imprisoned Hansel and Gretel (Bill Hader and Amy Poehler). Hot on the trail are Red's friends Wolf (Patrick Warburton) and the squirrel Twitchy (Cory Edwards).

From there it's a procession of pop-culture puns, plays on words, and cute little sociological riffs in rapid fire succession.  No you aren't going to find much emotional attachment here like you would in a modern Pixar piece (or for that matter a classic Disney film), instead prepare for a quick witted script delivered by A-list actors that outshines its lackluster visuals.

Surprisingly, the film has received overwhelming negative reviews from the onset despite the fact that fairy tales blended with contemporary references are harder to pull off than most realize (reference any of the three Unstable Fables or the two Happily Never Afters for more definitive proof of this phenomenon).  Arguable only the severely over-milked Shrek franchise has succeeded and to be completely honest, Hoodwinked Too! doesn't feel as convoluted or as poorly paced as (the generally higher regarded film of the same year), Puss in Boots.

However that's not to suggest Too! isn't without its misfires either- if you aren't particularly impressed with spoof scenes of other popular movies, be forewarned, this film is chock full of them.  Some are simply too clich&eacute;d for any real enjoyment (Terminator's ""I'll be back"" or Scarface's ""Say Hello to My Little Friend"") but a few (like Boingo Bunny's ""Hello Clarice"" have bite.  It certainly helps to go into the film in a silly mood.

In all, I suppose critics were more upset at the lack of clever story or singular enduring character but going back to the original Hoodwinked should really be proof enough that this series is more about zingers and pop culture references than it is creating a modern classic.  So long as you go in realizing this, Hoodwinked Too! won't disappoint.",1364774400,,2982,5.059183673469388

4532573,2,B0052XI5HK,"I was really looking forward to this movie.  I've always liked cartoons like Shrek which have a quick amusing story which children love, and enough jokes thrown in for the adults to enjoy.  I wasn't impressed though.  I never watched the first movie so I can't really compare it to that.  I'll just judge the movie on it's own merit.
The plot is simple enough.  A clandestine agency called (HEA) Happily Ever After helps protect the world of fairy tales and keep happy endings in tact.  At the start of the story the agency tries to save Hansel and Gretel who are kidnapped by the evil witch.  The plan goes south and Red Riding Hood's grandma gets captured.  So Red, Wold, and Twitchy set off to save her.
The movie has a laugh or two every now and then.  But ultimately it's just not funny.  Most of the jokes fall flat.  The animation still looks good even though it was produced on a relatively small budget.  And they did retain some good voice talent.
Patrick Warburton is always funny no matter what he's in.  And this is no exception.  Also Amy Pohler, Cheech Marin, and Martin Short add their talents.  But this is still not enough to pull the movie out.  It just falls flat.  At least for adults anyway.  I'd say kids won't see any difference.  So if you can find it cheap, probably worth picking up still.",1357776000,2,1316,4.430962343096234

The film was successful as the film budgeted at $15 million (which is very low for an animated film), would go on to earn $110 million in the box office.

Looked at as an animated parody of ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Hoodwinked!"" introduces us to Little Red Riding Hood, Granny, the Big Bad Wolf and Twitchy the Squirrel.  By the end of the film, the four are enlisted by Nicky Flippers to join the Happily Ever After Agency and take on crime.

Hood vs. Evil"" which was budgeted around $30 million unfortunately had a delayed release and instead of being released in January 2011 (which the Burger King promotion for the toys began), was released in April 2011 and unfortunately made only half of its budget in the box office.

""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" now makes its appearance on Blu-ray with a Blu-ray + DVD release scheduled for an August 16, 2011 release.

VIDEO:

""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (widescreen 1:78:1).  Picture quality  is good.  Nice details on the objects and surroundings are good.  On the main characters, details are good but not as excessive as other big-budget animated films.  Because this film does feature its fair share of animals, you expect to see a lot of hair physics and really making the fur look realistic.  ""Hoodwinked"" is not one of those type of animated films.

In fact, at first I was wondering if the film was stop-motion because some of the characters look like models and are solid.  But ""Hoodwinked"" goes for its own style, its own look and it works.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio.  The lossless audio is good but could have been better.  If anything, for an animated film with a lot of action sequences, you would expect to hear more robust surround usage but instead, it becomes more dialogue driven and sound from the front and center channels.  But for the dialogue, audio is clear and understandable.

Subtitles are in English SDH.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" comes with the following special features:

  Music Videos - Included are the following music videos ""I Can Do It Alone"" by Hayden Panettiere (3:34), ""You Know It"" by Lavay Cole (3:02) and ""Perfect Two"" by CeeJ (3:13).

EXTRAS:

""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" comes with a Blu-ray and DVD version of the film.  The DVD is presented in 1:78:1 widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1 plus a $10 off a $30 purchase of Dippin' Dots merchandise coupon on the Dippin' Dots website.

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" has its moments of fun and while one can say that fairy tale characters in a hero setting are not that interesting, the first film did very well in the box office.  But I feel that this sequel had some issues from its delayed release (which is never a good thing) and lost out on the kids meal tie-in (as the toys came out months before the movie was released).

Needless to say, ""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" unfortunately failed in the box office and whether or not it does well on Blu-ray and DVD, who knows.

Is it a family film?  I watched it with my eight-year-old and he enjoyed it as the film does have its funny moments.  But because it is rated PG, many parents may be wondering why the film is PG.

For one, you have the three little pigs who are trying to kill Red Riding Hood and the Big Bad Wolf, you have the antagonists who want to destroy all living things and there are moments of crude humor.  Granted, nothing overly violent but for some parents, it may be too much for their little ones.  But for older kids, no problem.

But I figured that while I found the film to be fun and good, because the film quality-wise in animation and also story-wise was OK, I felt that perhaps maybe my 8-year-old would be a bit more upbeat about the film.

I asked my son about what he thought about the film and interesting thing is that he immediately talked about the first film and the kids meal toys (So, I guess the kids meal tie-in is very important for children) and in this case, he talked about how cool the Woodsman was in the first film (he is shown a few times later towards the end of the sequel).

He also mentioned that the characters of Red Riding Hood, Granny, the Big Bad Wolf are too boring for him.  So, I guess he didn't like it much as I thought he did and for me, I enjoyed it a bit more.

As for the Blu-ray release, I felt the lossless audio could have been better, I felt there could have been more special features included (perhaps even a commentary track) and the picture quality, I felt the animation was good but for a feature film amongst the other competition out there, it's like comparing apples to oranges and ""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" was more like a grape.

Overall, ""Hoodwinked Too!: Hood vs. Evil"" was an OK animated film.  It's not the best, nor is it the worst but it had a feel of a direct-to-video type of film rather than an animated feature.",1323993600,,5674,4.649246231155779

4532607,3,B0052XI5HK,"My husband and I enjoyed the first Hoodwinked movie when it was first released several years ago, so we were interested in this one. I was also interested in the fairy tale usage since that is what I do. All the same, we sat down with the primary purpose of being entertained. I somewhat was, but not enough to put down my laptop and get really involved in the film, so I probably missed some visual puns.  While this had some cute moments, it didn't have the same heart or cleverness of the first movie. I don't expect much from movies like this and I have some kids in my life who will have fun with it, so it gets a middle of the road three stars. Yes, there is lots of cheese whiz and silliness but most of it was obvious, expected, once the humor was established. Still, I was amused at times and it was fun to see some lesser known tales make an appearance, too. Now I want to go back sometime and watch the original to see if it is as good as I remember it.",1322611200,,964,4.073684210526316
4532608,3,B0052XI5HK,"This movie just didn't strike a cord with me. It didn't have the same heart as the first one and the cheese factor was pretty high. Like most kid/family movies there are jokes and gags there for the adults but they really felt forced and out of place.

I would put this one down as a rental but not a purchase.",1321833600,,310,4.081967213114754
4532609,5,B0052XI5HK,Lots of action and an interesting story line is combined with great animation and beautiful colors. The kids (ages 6 and 8) were transfixed and loved it!

4532610,3,B0052XI5HK,"I loved the first hoodwinked, with its special ""here is the same story from several different perspectives, followed by a short mystery"".

This movie was just ok.

Normally I don't include spoilers but I have to tell you for you to understand the 3 star rating.

Spoiler alert... there is a big double cross in the middle, where you find out it was all a ""set up"" to get Granny Pucketts knowledge of a secret ingredient.

The lowdown:
The older kids said it was ""good"" but did not ask to watch it again.
I (the adult parent) thought it was completely lousy and didn't finish watching it.
The younger kids thought it was good but the bit ""set up"" went over their heads.  They just aren't sophisticated enough to get it.  I guess it doesn't really matter, but it wasn't linear enough for them.

Lots of arguing, blaming, and backbiting between characters is not very funny either.

Anyway its just ok.  so - three stars, which in Amazon world means ""its ok"".",1318464000,,956,4.511627906976744
4532611,5,B0052XI5HK,"I have to confess that I have never seen ""Hoodwinked!,"" the 2005 predecessor of ""Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil."" Because of this reason, I am in no position to compare both films. That said, I found the new installment funny and engaging.

In ""Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil,"" we find that Red Riding Hood is away training with the prestigious Sister Hoods group. While she is there, Verushka the Witch kidnaps Hansel and Gretel. Nicky Flippers, who is in charge of the Happily Ever After organization (HEA), dispatches a group to rescue the kids. However, the Big Bad Wolf and others from HEA are not up to the task, and fail in their attempt. Hence, Red Riding Hood is called to return immediately, in order that they can liberate Hansel and Gretel from Verushka the Witch. Unfortunately, things are not as easy as planned, and everybody - including us -- is fooled by the original kidnappers. However, Red Riding Hood and the gang are aided by good people along the way.

""Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs Evil"" is a very entertaining animated film, full of surprises and fun characters - and some evil ones, too. I truly enjoyed Mad Hog and Stone, with the voices of Cheech Marin and Tommy Chong, respectively, as well as the annoying Japeth the goat. As a matter of fact, the film is loaded with the voices of celebrities, such as Glenn Close, Amy Poehler, Bill Hader, Martin Short, Joan Cusack, David Odgen Stiers, David Alan Grier, Wayne Newton, Brad Garrett, and others. The Blu-ray edition includes music videos, storyboard sequences, and more. (USA, 2011, color, 87 mins plus additional materials). Exclusively reviewed on August 23, 2011 by Eric Gonzalez.

4532612,1,B0052XI5HK,"Hoodwinked Too! is such a disappointing sequel, I wish I had never seen it so as to taint the first, original movie. Where was Twitchy? Certainly not enough lines and presence for him. And Wolf? Barely present, not to mention poor Japeth the goat who had bad lines and script...the movie blows, plain and simple. They must have had new writers? I mean, who cares about Red and Granny anyway? A storyline about Red being at a convent of sorts, being trained? Very lame. Stick to the first ""Hoodwinked"" and you'll not be disappointed, but this sequel is very bad.",1318377600,2,561,4.62

4532614,3,B0052XI5HK,"Great animated features are able to entertain people of all ages and levels of education. The original Hoodwinked is just such a movie. While Hoodwinked Too! may appeal to children, it has little to offer the rest of us. The storyline is flat with few surprises. The clever, multiple narratives interlacing the original movie's storyline are missing from the sequel. A couple of the principal voice actors have been replaced (Red, Kirk the Woodsman) causing their characters to lose some their edginess. Benjy Gaither's Japeth (the goat) has been reduced from a self-reliant and resourceful genius to a helpless, Job-like victim.
Something in the artistic quality of the drawn characters was also lost in their CGI transformation in order to appeal to the 3-D market. The extensive time and creative talent that went into producing the original is clearly missing from Hoodwinked Too! If the producers, goal was to produce another children's movie quickly, and under budget then they have succeeded. If their goal was to reprise the success of the original Hoodwinked, they have failed. Perhaps, because the first movie was so great, I am disappointed because I expected more.",1317945600,3,1176,5.162303664921466

They also really loved the squirrel Twitchy.

Unlike many other ""kids"" movies out there today, this one has minimal violence and doesn't have the really scary evil villain scenes that have really scared my 4 year old.

The Hansel and Gretel characters which become bad guys at the end are defeated by inflating them up like balloons and rolling them away. No killing at the end like some other kid movies.",1317254400,,582,4.576923076923077

It has alot of adult humour and situations that I really didn't want my kids to watch.  I know that I find my family watching more family oriented movies but this one really didn't work for me.  the animation was great and it did have some funny parts but the whole thing didn't work.  I guess that was why this is rated PG and for good reason.  Overall I would stick with other  cartoon movies for your kids.  Some humour and stuff is fine but too much is not a good thing.,1317168000,,625,4.107438016528926

Hood goes into training with a group of women known as ""Sisters of the Hood."" There's women there of all ages but there is one old lady who seems to be the comic relief. As in, a rolling pin hits her and that's supposed to be funny. I'm not sure why, but it's supposed to be. Then later on she falls (not sure why, maybe something else hits her) but then the head lady steps on her. Hard. In fact she walks all over her. It's like she did it purposely! Why is being mean to an old lady funny? Is there a back story in which this old lady did something that I am unaware of? I didn't like my son seeing this kind of behavior.

4532622,5,B0052XI5HK,"I have to say that i was a huge fan of the first film, still are since it was wonderful. I don't know what it was about that first film film but i loved it. Don't know if it was the twist on classic fairy tale characters and how they twisted them. Or maybe it was the look of the film mixed with the story. Perhaps it was the cast that gave life to the characters or a combination of them all. No matter what was the reason the point is that I loved it. So of course I could not wait until a second film was made, I mean the end of the first begged for it right?

Well when it was put out there that the next film was coming I was way to excited about it. I knew from the get go though that the first would always be better. The fresh take that they took for that film would be hard to duplicate and create again. So I knew that while it would still be kinda the same style the new film would have some changes to it. Once we popped this in we loved it but I was right it was a bit different. Still it was a great little flick that we enjoyed, especially my little cuz.

This film picks up kinda where the last left off with Red and them now apart of an elite unit of agents for the government. But at this point while all under the same agency they are off on different paths. Granny is kidnapped and the feuding Red and Wolf are at different points in their lives at work. They think they don't need one another and can't stand how the other works. But if Granny is to be saved they must find a way to over come their differences and work together. With the help of old friends as well as new they just might do it.

I personally really enjoyed this film as did my girl and little cuz like I said,the first one is the better one but it is still good. I am hoping for a third film to make this a great trilogy, how great would that be? The film has some cool special features and of course a great voice cast. If you loved the first film you should like this one, although the first s the best we should all know by now that sequels are usually never better.

Hood vs. Evil</a>&nbsp;I found to be a charming little movie. The production quality is about what one would expect for a kids movie (this isn't being done by Dreamworks or Pixar (it is being done by a company named ""The Weinstein Company,"" which I have never heard of) but what I wasn't expecting were the fairly numerous jokes aimed squarely at adults. They put a lot of juvenile humor and silly actions sequences in as well -- but the movie is also fairly sprinkled with in-jokes and movie references just for adults.  The kids will still understand what is going on, but the adults will have more of a reason to smile.

The voice acting for this movie is fairly spot-on, although I am not sure I understand how Patrick Warburton keeps getting cast for voice work. He was a very good fit for Kronk in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Emperor-s-New-Groove/dp/B000AAF1U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Emperor's New Groove</a>&nbsp;as that was what the character called for, a large powerfully present voice, that was kind of slow and dull witted.  But, after that movie Warbuton kept getting cast in more and more roles outside of that type of character. It is baffling.  I am sure kids will recognize the voice and enjoy it though.  Hayden Panettiere does a good job voicing Red, and her character is a nice, strong female character young girls can look up to.  I was baffled by th ""3 little pigs"" being included as evil henchmen with hispanic accents, but I am assuming they set that up in the first movie?

All in all, I liked the plot twist, I enjoyed the humor, and I was able to overlook the production quality. [If you can't, subtract a star in your head =) ]

The story is difficult for kids to follow and there are some 'jokes' (I use the term lightly) that are a bit too suggestive in my opinion. I'm assuming this was an attempt to humor the parents that might be watching...They failed.
That said, my kids adore this movie. I'm a little embarrassed to admit that they like it so much as I thought that my children would surely be born with a naturally high brow taste in theater and a sharp sense of humor that would not tolerate dumbed-down attempts to amuse them, but alas, they enjoy fart jokes. Thoroughly. :/
I suggest renting this movie as apposed to buying. I'm sure many parents will not approve of some of the material that Hoodwinked Too! attempts to pass of as humor so you might want to screen this first...if you can stand it. I wouldn't recommend this movie for children under 5 and even that might be a bit of a stretch.",1316390400,2,1004,4.374331550802139

Not saying it was a bad film, just that it could have been better IMO.
Animated fims can have great sequels (Toy Story, Shrek, and Cars) and some can have really bad ones (The Fox and The Hound), I would say ""Hoodwinked Too"" is sort in between the good and the bad.
I did like, however, the great voice cast.

We sat down as a family and watched it together the first time, and I've seen it about 20 times since then because my children continue to play it over and over. My husband and I both agreed that it wasn't as good as the first one, mostly because the story skips around quite a bit and is a little hard to follow.

As far as the kids go (boys ages 2, 4, 7, and 9), they don't care if it skips around. They think it's hilarious and they are totally engrossed from the first scene to the last.

I knocked another star off for a scene where the wolf goes to visit the squirrel at his home, and when he knocks on the door there's 'romance' music playing and first one female squirrel, and then another, come waltzing out of the trailer. They both give the squirrel, who is in a silk robe,  a big kiss on the lips before they leave. This was inappropriate and unnecessary for a kids' movie. My children didn't seem to notice or understand what any of that meant, but it still caught me off-guard and brought down my enjoyment of the movie.

We discussed the elements of a movie review beforehand and I asked the students to look out for certain aspects of the film as they watched.  I will give a brief summary of some of their answers:
1. My favorite characters:  ""Grandma"" because she has a funny laugh. ""Wolf"" because he was the coolest of all the characters.
2. Did you like the film...why or why not?  The overwhelming majority of my students had previously seen the original HOODWINKED and they all loved the movie. One student said ""it was funny and sad at the same time.""  The one student who did NOT care for the movie said ""it was a little boring. It needed more action.""
3. Voices of Characters? After the movie we watched the special features where they showed the real actors doing their voiceovers. They were particularly surprised to see Heidi Klum from ""Project Runway"" speaking with a thick German accent.
4. Favorite scenes? They liked the Ogre on the bridge scene with Red, and the scene where Heidi Klum's character was ""jumping up and down on the pigs.""
5. Appropriate for What Ages? The students all agreed that this movie was best suited for children aged 10 or 11 and higher. They thought middle school students would like it the most. Some thought that adults would like it, too.
6. Better than the original HOODWINKED? All but one student said HOODWINKED TOO was better than the original. Having never seen the first one I have no opinion.

Overall, my class was quiet and watched intently. They lauged and got excited at the appropriate times durinng their viewing. Several students have asked to borrow HOODWINKED TOO so they could show their brothers and sisters.",1315872000,,1791,4.7092651757188495

Granny gets herself in some trouble and it's up to Wolf, Red and the rest of the 'original suspects' to come to her rescue.  The story is fairly original and has plenty of laughs for children and adults alike.  Those whom have not seen Hoodwinked may be a little lost, so I highly recommend seeing that first.

There is a great cast of voice actors in this movie, and like a lot of animated comedies there are fleeting references to other movies woven into the plot all along (like the bunny's take on Hannibal).
With the absolute wealth of possibilities here, taking the childrens classic fairy tale characters and spinning it, along with the talent on offer, this should have been a good, funny animated movie, unfortunately it misses on so many levels.
The characters aren't really that engaging, the story isn't engrossing and the comedy is barely there at all.  I found it hard to get into this movie and to be honest found it hard to watch all the way through to the end.
As such I can't recommend this movie to anyone.  A shameful miss.",1315785600,,888,4.54375

It was a bit more childish slow paced antics than some other movies I've watched.  The one thing I must say though is I'm impressed with the focusing of how Good vs. Evil is being addressed.  There was more praise for doing good here than there was emphasis on the wrong doing so the message should come through nicely for youngen's.  I guess I'm just a bit old fashioned though as I prefer good ole cartoons to this new age computer generated stuff.

All in all I will say kudo's to the story writer's and such for a job well done that will entertain grade school kids the proper way.  This does reaffirm my faith that there is still some good in movies and television today.",1315699200,,787,4.283783783783784

The story line definitely has a twist of a story line. I like the theme of finding out that people have different ways of doing things, but you can still work well together.

4532643,1,B0052XI5HK,"The original Hoodwinked was fairly meh to being with, though it did have the saving grace of a unique hook in that each main character had a different version of events of what went down. It was a great method of telling a rather blah plot (evil bunny steals a secret recipe, yadda yadda yadda).

Here, in Hoodwinked Too, what made its predecessor stick out and rise above its own mediocrity is thrown away... instead, it follows the Shrek formula of ""generic adventure + copious pop culture reference = profit??""

Now agents for the Happily Ever After agency (basically fairy tale SWAT), the returning cast (with Hayden Panettiere replacing Anne Hathaway, who smartly didn't join in this crapfest) is at each others' throats due to Wolf being upset that Red is away learning baking kung fu from a mysteriously cliche Sisterhood.

Desserts are again the MacGuffin of the movie, this time taking the form of an ultra-chic chocolate truffle (made from the rarest of ingredients) that grants superpowers. So difficult is it to make this recipe that the film's villains kidnap Granny to force her to bake it.

Really, there's not much to prop up the film... Wolf and Twitchy do most of the work comedically, switching the role of straight man back and forth between them. The buddy cop trope cattiness between Wolf and Red is forced and, while Joan Cusack's turn as the evil witch Verushka can at times be fun, for the most part it's a letdown.

Especially painful to watch were Hansel and Gretel doing a reprise of Andy Dick's showstopping ""You've been hoodwinked, baby"" song from the first film, turning it into ""You've been hoodwinked TOO!"" Oiy ve... it was fun the first time, but slapping new paint and a few new vocals on it for a second go'round lacked the soul and wit that Dick brought to the cute fluffy bunny gone bad. Sure, Boingo shows up for a brief cameo, but dumping him for Hansel and Gretel... terrible idea. The least the writers could've done was make him the secret puppet master of the whole thing instead of just a go between for The Witch and the criminal element.

Annnnnyways, Hoodwinked Too did a great job of killing off any potential it had to make me smile when it dropped the structure of the first's narrative and instead decided to become a cheap Shrek imitation doing casual pop riffs on fairy tale standbys.

4532649,4,B0052XI5HK,"What made the original HOODWINKED such a delight was its irreverent twist on the venerable fairy tale and its clever script---plus it was very funny to boot.
While HOODWINKED TOO is entertaining and has some funny moments, its just not as fun as the original.  Perhaps it's the all-too-familiar trend to hype up the frantic chase sequences and the now tired self-discovery storyline.  The film takes on a James Bondish aura and let's save the world scenario which is getting used too much in today's animation offerings.
HWTOO does have some clever in-jokes, such as the SILENCE OF THE LAMBS reference with the evil bunny.  Most of the voice acting is effective, especially Corey Edwards' Twitchy, Joan Cusack's evil witch, Patrick Warburton's loutish Wolf; and Bill Hader and Amy Poehler's quirkish Hansel and Gretel.  Glenn Close is fine as Granny, but is underused.  Hayden Panettiere doesn't bring the feisty gusto to Red as Anne Hathaway did.  And the female pop songs are awful.
HOODWINKED TOO should appeal to kids and adults should find it diverting.  It's sad it didn't achieve the quality of its predecessor; its box office failure also indicates chances for a third film are pretty slim.

I can not remember being as painfully bored with a movie in my life, which only made the disappointment worse.

""Hoodwinked Too"" doesn't have as many great musical numbers as the first (I loved the Yodeling skit from the first) it does have all the same great characters and a few more!

""Hoodwinked Too"" is about a secret truffle recipe that gets stolen and Red, Granny and the gang go after it.  The story is somewhat predictable but then again it is a kids movie (rated PG.)  I love that I was able to watch this movie with my boys and we could all appreciate it.  The movie had characters they liked and dialogue and remarks that my husband and I could enjoy.  Don't worry there is nothing inappropriate but just funny dialogue and references that kids may not get.  Like the Evil Bunny appearing as Hannibal Lector, which is my personal favorite!

Also, they didn't follow the general formula of the first which was to take a fairy tale and disassemble it from 3 perspectives. That being said though, the storyline was sweet and engaging (just as much as the first if not more as this time around there were a couple really wonderful life lessons mixed in with the humor) Myself, husband, and our 10 yr old son spent the whole movie laughing (as we did with the first) and we loved it.

I didn't enjoy the sequel as well as the first Hoodwinked, however. I was looking forward to seeing the same unique story line that follows different but intersecting accounts of what happened from the various perspectives of the characters in the fairy tale. Hoodwinked Too doesn't present the story that way and I was a little disappointed.

Vivacious Granny is back with all her gusto and Red is the main star, but the dry wit of the wolf played by Patrick Warburton is the real pleaser of this movie. (Warburton is the obnoxious boyfriend in Bee Movie.) The (not so) bad wolf's  character is quite hilarious. During a wild chase, Granny tells him to put his man pants on and ""knuckle up, dog"". The suave frog, in charge of the HEA, is a real charmer too.- HEA stands for Happy Ever After Agency.

I thought it was a GREAT movie to teach the concept of not judging until you have all the information.  And it was done in a fresh and entertaining way.

Hoodwinked Too didn't have any point.  It didn't go anywhere.  It had no real underlying story to tell.  It was just a pointless mish mash of plagiarized scenes from Spiderman 2, Star Wars (pod race), The Incredibles and others.  About 5 minutes into the show I started thinking 'This is boring.

Being an adult and father I am required by law to watch cartoons with my kids. Some of the recent ones were a struggle. This one I was more excited about then they were. The first one was hilarious and this one held up very well. This is a ""Shrek"" like cartoon in the way that 90% of the jokes are geared toward grown-ups. There is a ""Silence Of The Lambs"" and a ""Goodfellas"" reference thrown in, which most kids will not understand. To be fair though, my kids laughed at the slapstick aspect and it kept my 2 year old interested, so it is good for kids as well. When compared to the first one, I will have to say that they are equally funny. This one had more adult humor then the first one though. Overall, a great movie for adults that kids will enjoy.

4532659,3,B0052XI5HK,"HOODWINKED (2005) was an animated feature; a revisionist history that retold the story of LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD, RASHOMAN-style.

 Questioned by the police, Red, Granny, the Big Bad Wolf and the Woodsman all tell different, but parallel stories about the events that took place at Granny's cottage, painting a remarkably different picture than what children have read about for generations.

 It was a clever, albeit silly, movie that evoked a few chuckles from the grown-ups, but delighted the small fry.  Some of the songs were very clever.

 The picture ended with Red, Granny and the Wolf joining the super secret Happily Ever After Agency (HEA), a group that exists to insure that fairy tales have happy endings.

 HOODWINKED TOO!  HOOD vs EVIL (2011) has just been released by Anchor Bay Entertainment in a Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.

 The story pretty much picks up where the original left off.  Red is in training with a covert group, Sisters of the Hood, when HEA calls her in to handle a case.

 It seems that two children, Hansel and Gretel, have been kidnapped by a wicked witch, and Red, Granny and Wolf are assigned to rescue them.

 As with the first film, I liked the songs, smiled a few times, but I would have enjoyed the proceedings much more if I was ten-years-old. HOODWINKED TOO!  HOOD vs EVIL is definitely a picture for kids.

 Glenn Close (Granny), Patrick Warburton (Wolf) and David Ogden Stiers  (Detective Flippers) repeat their voice roles from the original, while Hayden Panettiere takes over from Ann Hathaway as Red and Martin Short replaces Jim Belushi as the Woodsman.  Other voice talents in this one include Bill Hader (Hansel), Amy Poehler (Gretel) and Joan Cusack as the witch.

 Extras include three music videos and some ""Behind the Scenes"" featurettes.
