1425871,4,B00005IBT5,"WOMEN IN FURY is simply one of the best (if not the best) women in prison flicks I have seen. WOMEN IN FURY offers the standard fare we look for in WIP flicks: sadism, lesbian scenes, interrogation by firehose, prison riot, escape, and good doses of nudity. WOMEN IN FURY ups the ante by adding a good story to the mix and maintaining a well paced build-up in the first half that appropriately turns into an action movie in the second half. WOMEN IN FURY is the story of Angela Duvall who is imprisoned for the murder of a drug dealer. A wet towel beating and rape by her cellmates lands her in the infirmary where the prison doctor comes to believe she is innocent of the crime. While the doctor butts heads with the prison captain and investigates the circumstances of the shooting of the drug dealer, a conspiracy is at hand to kill Angela. One of these attempts sets this movie into high gear. WOMEN IN FURY is a Brazilian movie with excellent production values only slightly marred by an occasional bad dub or cheap effect. WOMEN IN FURY succeeds at delivering a good story, maintaining a crisp pace, and delivers a healthy amount of what is expected from a WIP flick.--Bob",1105920000,41,1178,4.509345794392523
1425872,4,B00005IBT5,People please tell me how can you have a womens in prison movie without a show all shower scene?  The movie is great and is based on a true story of a women put in a Brazilian prison for the wrong reason.  Gratuitous meaningless nudity especially the part they whip the leading actress with wet bath towels...  Great movie but no shower scene?,1023840000,9,343,4.412698412698413
7938296,2,B00005IBT5,Image is not good quality and there are many missing scenes from the original version. If I knew didn't have bought.,1391644800,,116,4.571428571428571
7938297,4,B00005IBT5,I'm a fan of the women in prison (WIP) genre so I wanted to see what this film was about. Not the greatest WIP flick but it has it's moments.,1362355200,,141,3.7333333333333334
7938298,3,B00005IBT5,Ok there are a couple  of good  scenes here but not worth buying - trust me I did and I regret it! The towel scene is very good  and so is the lesbo  scene with the warden  but way to  much story line!,1179360000,,201,3.558139534883721
7938299,2,B00005IBT5,"It's a safe bet that those of you who are thinking about renting/buying/viewing this film - and many if not most of you who are reading this revgiew - are probably fans of or interested in the ""Women in Prison"" (WIP) category in the sub-genre exploitation cinema.  Although I was planning to give a brief summary of the plot, I stopped to wonder what (if any) difference it would make.  The plots of these films are not only utterly similar, but nigh indistinguishable from each other, and what disctinctions (if any) they may have amongst themselves/with each other are rather minor details not particularly significant.  Rather, it is the common theme elements they all share that make them worth watching: copious female nudity, lesbian encounters, shower scenes, cartoonish characters, absurd dialogue and/or dubbing - but mostly just the nude women and lesbian content.

There was a time when this film, WOMEN IN FURY, did stand out because its content was considered more explicit and excessive even among the other films of the (sub)genre.  Although the film istelf contained a lot of compelling tawdriness, unfortunately the version of the movie from NETFLIX is edited and bland.  Not much nudity, and barely any lesbian content.  What was a masterpiece of sexy WIP trash has in some cases been diluted until it isn't even a blip on the Cinemax radar.  Nice going, NETFLIX (you douchebags).  So if you buy this film, make sure it's not a denuded (pun not intended but useful) copy.",1179273600,6,1489,4.924
7938300,3,B00005IBT5,"I confess, I am a huge fan of WIP (Women in Prison) movies. Is it the sweaty stains that reveal pert nipples on their jailhouse duds? The fact that no matter how degraded or disgusting their surroundings, these gals still wear make up fit for a Cosmo shoot? Is it the repressed lesbian lusts of the guards and the warden? Or is it all these things, stirred to boil, and strained to make a fine tea of sex and violence (and naked showering)? This film does the genre proud, replete with lesbo warden, lesbo bitch rapist, running around the jungle bare foot, and sleazy straight sex. I mean, whaddya expecting here, War and Peace?",1167436800,3,628,4.517543859649122
7938301,5,B00005IBT5,"At first,I did not know what to expect from an imported film. The beginning starts with a lawyer arriving in Venezuela and a little kid escorts him to the doctor's house. The doctor then launches into the story of a young woman named Anglea Duvall,who is framed for murder and thrown into a womens prison for 18 years. After a while,however,Anglea discovers prison won't be as easy as she thinks. In the space of three days,she is beaten,hanged,and put through a series of painful initiations. The head matron,a kind and wonderful woman,tries to win Angela's affections,being a lesbian. Angela,however,will not talk. There,she befriends a kind woman named Denise,who promises to look after her,because she is weak. However,the head honcho,Captain Bonofascio,tries as hard as he can to make sure angela suffers at the prison. It isn't long before the women's fury is unleashed and they stage a full scale revolt,escaping the prison and into the Brazillian jungle. Along with the great lesbian scenes,at which its worth every penny,I would recommend this movie to all you women's prison film fans",1167004800,4,1094,5.151685393258427
7938302,2,B00005IBT5,"So what do we have here in this women in prison flick, a ""true story that happened to real people""?  To start with, no decent entry scene for the pretty heroine, who is imprisoned unjustly or something, I didn't have the sound up.  But after too much plot, there is a very good wet towel whip scene to introduce her to the inmates, followed by some minimal afro lez.  A doctor's office scene is wasted, no exam, and he's male, so no doc lez.  Much more plot, and we finally get a hosing down scene with leering guards, but only topless.  More plot, and there's actually a hanging scene, somewhat rare in these things, but it's too short and fully dressed.  Finally after way too much plot get we some decent warden/guard lez, a refusal, and then some threatened baton abuse that gets warm but turns into a more extensive lez out, pretty decent, R rated but full frontal.  Then there's  partially nude catfighting and some prisoner lez that nevers gets started, and you can turn it off right there, the rest is plot.

Well, what can you say about a WIP film that includes NO SHOWER SCENE??  Unforgivable.  Franco got away with that once, but then his WIP movie was almost totally topless, which made up for it. And no whipping either, aside from the towel.  I don't know, two sleaze scene stars I suppose, one for the towel scene (can you imagine why that didn't happen in the shower room?), 1/2 for the asphyx scene, maybe a 1/2 for the nudity, but the NTRL factor is pretty low.  Too bad, some of the prisoners were kinda cute.",1150934400,9,1528,4.433691756272402
7938303,4,B00005IBT5,"OK, maybe I liked the film because I didn't expect much but it was actually very intertaining to watch.  And as the title for my review says,..the scene with the head matron was actually very hot which I didn't expect.  If you can buy the movie for under $10 it is worth it.",1135296000,7,274,4.150943396226415
7938304,3,B00005IBT5,"If you like over-the-top WIP flicks, you might wanna check this one out.  It's loaded with all the things that WIP flicks should have: violence, catfights, exploitation of women, lesbianism, and gobs of nudity.  In this particular flick, the plot is actually pretty decent, too.",1111363200,21,278,5.155555555555556
7938305,3,B00005IBT5,"First of all,i have to tell you that is very hard to see in Brazil(my country)what you see inthis film. A rich girl will never be sent to prison ,even her drug adict brother for the murder of a drug dealler. Our justice sistem is very corrupt and this its not true that is based on a real fact. The cast of the movie is formed by a lot of Brazil's TV actors. Somenthing curios is that the guy that plays the doctor is a real one. Another problem is the way they show oour countryside ,we don't have gold mines in our capitals,like the one show when the girls are scaping and kil the guys that try to rape them,altoght,it's a honest women's prision film. Thanks",1106092800,14,660,4.2047244094488185
