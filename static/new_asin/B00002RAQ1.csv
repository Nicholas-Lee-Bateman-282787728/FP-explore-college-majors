Just get the DVD and save yourself the trouble. You can always use it for a coaster, if nothing else.

This is KERI RUSSELL we're talking about here. The previous reviewers all approached this movie the same way: ""how much nudity is there? NO NUDITY? Oh no!"" They're idiots, don't be like them. I'm GLAD they didn't enjoy it. Heathens. They've spent too many hours in the dank backwaters of the internet, searching for pictures of things I don't even want to think about, to truly appreciate the lovely Keri Russell in all her teenage glory.

She is so serenely beautiful it takes your breath away (something tells me previous reviewers are using other means to achieve the same goal).

I think that the reason previous reviewers don't appreciate this movie is because Keri is like a goddess in a Da Vinci painting. You wouldn't expect Mona Lisa to run around naked, would you? Those guys would stand in front of the painting and say ""I don't like it. She's got clothes on.""

If you first saw Keri Russell on ""Felicity,"" bear in mind that this was made two years before that, in 1996. Her youthful beauty is without a doubt the only thing that saves this turkey from jumping out of your DVD player and flopping around on the floor.

As a bonus for you, because she was in the beginning of her acting career she apparently couldn't afford new blue jeans and so was forced to wear the ones from her childhood. She'd plainly outgrown them. Ahem.

As for the plot, it's ""Evil Stepfather, Version 543.7"". What makes or breaks a movie of this genre depends on casting a truly warped actor to play the wicked stepfather. Unfortunately, this movie doesn't. Instead, they got Stephen Collens, who wouldn't be convincing as an out-of-work Accountant, if you ask me. He's about as menacing as a grocery clerk. He valiently chews the scenery for two hours, to no avail. He obviously spent the check before he'd seen the script, or else been hired by the producers to deliberately ruin the movie (a la ""The Producers"").

The twist in this variation is that it's not a terrified step-daughter being threatened here, it's the poor, beguiling baby sitter (played by Keri Russell), who is seduced by Pops upon the rather unclear disappearance of his wife. Some instinct for bad movies tells me her scenes wound up on the cutting room floor. (The gaping hole in the plot, for instance.)

After plying Keri with Wifey's left-behind jewels and elegant gowns, she is swept into a whirlwind of illicit couplings (shot in the patented ""swirly slo-mo pan mode"" with appropriate 70's ""wallpaper"" music). Keri endures a few groping sessions with Pops, all the while hiding her hussy ways from her loving plastic family.

Now, I don't want to the ""plot,"" such as it is, on the extremely unlikely chance you may derive some enjoyment from, but you'll find yourself glued to the edge of your seat (if you're not careful) at the end of the chase scene which winds up at the aforementioned pool, where earlier the cretin Pops had ogled Keri swimming in a bikini (obviously admiring her stroke) rubbing his slimy hands together and hatching his evil plot. Keri rises slowly from the steamy water, wearing semi-transparent clothing on an obviously very chilly night (ahem).

It's something to look forward to. When you see Keri thrashing around in the pool, you'll probably want to give yourself a big hand for coming so far.

Phylicia Rashad attempts to act in the role of Detective Kate Jacobs, a retired whaling boat captain or something (I don't recall, it was just after the ""pool scene"" and I had to rest up and hose down the room) who now has the free time to run LAPD. She tries to warn Keri that something is hinkey about Pops but supects that Keri is possibly mixed up in the disappearance of wifey, and so is forced to let Pops have his (and quite possibly, your) sordid way with our porcelain-skinned goddess.

The director, David Burton Morris, and costume designer C.A. Melto are interviewed on the accompanying documentary. If you listen closely you can hear them as they beat the writer with their unemployment forms, symbolizing the last vestiges of their once-promising careers.

Can Keri prevail, or will Pops overcome her? Will his evil plan work? Get the DVD to find out!",1114732800,25,4450,4.726451612903226
