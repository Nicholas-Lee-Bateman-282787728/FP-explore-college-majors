This is one of the various options to actually view this series , and it contains the alleged (incorrectly the 1st ep, I will say that the first ep is the one about the diamond smugglers- Van Williams complained about his mask so the prop dept. made the one with the Hornet seal to replace it) and the Batman/ Green Hornet crossover. In quality it is cable quality, and not as god as some I have seen None the less this is what's out there, so if you like the Green Hornet, this is how you can see this series .",1523664000,,628,4.032

8583923,5,B00CO9XA7K,"I am a huge fan of both Bruce Lee, and the Batman tv series. If you like goofball humor and ridiculous villains, you will love this as much as I do. This dvd is a 2 part Batman episode where The Green Hornet and Kato happen to be in Gotham City on business. Do Batman and The Green Hornet work with, or against each other?.......you'll have to watch to find out. (And you'll have fun doing it).",1410912000,2,394,4.12987012987013
8583924,4,B00CO9XA7K,"if you like the old shows this is great! captures the real Green Hornet! but be warned this was probly made or copied in Japan.. so when ever the Green Hornet is getting too much screen time they cut in a totally unrelated Kato {Bruce Lee} fight scene... this is a little confusing and takes away from the original story line.. BUT once you realize what's going it's tolerable.. and kinda funny.. even more so after a couple of drinks <grin>
all in all not bad footage, and if your looking to reminisce over your old favorite TV shows this will satisfy that craving!",1225584000,,566,4.451923076923077
