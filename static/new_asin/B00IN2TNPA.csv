8643508,5,B00IN2TNPA,"Excellent documentary! Roger Williams, founder of Rhode Island, wrote "" there should be a hedge between the garden of the church and the wilderness of the state"". This documentary explains that if the wilderness is allowed to encroach upon the garden the garden will no longer be fruitful, whereas, if the garden were expanded into the wilderness all of nature would benefit. Our founders understood that ""reason and experience both forbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of religious principle"" ( George Washington, farewell address).",1457049600,,564,5.348314606741573
8643509,1,B00IN2TNPA,"I was force-fed David Barton garbage back in high school.  While this ""documentary"" throws a few bones to objectivity towards the middle/end, the whole thing clearly starts from the stance that Barton's claims about the Founding Fathers and separation of church and state are true.  It also uses largely the same tactics, the same semantic word games, as Barton does.  If you enter into watching something like this with ""Christianity is right and is the best/only way to structure/govern a society, the Founding Fathers were all Bible-believing conservative Christians, etc"" in your mind, then it will probably give you a good ego stroke.  If you go in without assumptions and take the claims and the rhetoric at face value (which I assert you should), you will find yourself constantly at odds with what is stated in this documentary.
And I will absolutely concede that a religious person can be objective about things, but the fact that this version of history is championed by Christian institutions, and that this film is narrated by a pastor, should go a long way to revealing its underlying bias.",1448150400,2,1103,4.978260869565218
8643510,2,B00IN2TNPA,"ADVISORY!!!
This was a aproduction of Lutheran Hour Ministries and, although it's not as biased as the right wing ideologue and revisionist historian David Barton, it does playfast & loose with many historical facts about the 1st Amendment and the Framers' religious sensibilities . The film supports a legal view that stands in oppostion to how SCOTUS has decided time and again in favor of a solid separation between Church & State. They make one claim (in response to the question: ""Is America a Christian nation?"") that the Founding Fathers would have been ""comfortable"" saying America is a nation founded by Christian people with Christian values. Total nonsense! Washington loathed the Christian faith; Adams never attended Church regularly and thought Christianity a fairytale; and Jefferson was even more anti-clerically inclined even going so far as to write critically of Biblical contradictions. Franklin was an Enlightenment-style atheist though not openly. So the idea that the 1st Amendment was really written by secret Christophiles is nonsesne. But the LHM is trying to sell this anyway.
In the final analysis, it really matters little what they thought in 1787. What matters id what we think as Americans today---plus the huge body of SCOTUS ""stare decisis"" or settled law. I regard this movie as less an attempt to clarify and educate and more of a ""wolf in sheep's clothing""...a respectably subtle piece of Rightwing agitprop in disguise. LHM wants to further cloud the clear boundaries of secular America's Constitutional wall of separation.",1445904000,5,1561,5.298387096774194
8643511,5,B00IN2TNPA,It is unbiased information on the subject of church and state.,1444348800,,62,4.7272727272727275
8643512,5,B00IN2TNPA,"I enjoyed it very much!  This topic is very timely to our current cultural situation.  It is important for all Americans to understand the 1st Amendment.  It is not written to build a wall of separation between church and state.  It was written to ensure that Government does not impose religion, but fosters religious freedom.  IN GOD WE TRUST!",1442188800,2,345,4.779661016949152
8643513,1,B00IN2TNPA,"Slow, very slow moving documentary.  I could not watch even half of it.  It seemed as if it were written by the right-wing religious.",1441843200,4,133,4.5
8643514,1,B00IN2TNPA,"The show was a very empty and one sided propaganda piece that basically argues that separation of church and state should not exist, at least as far as placing any limits on religion, but in terms of providing support for religion, they seem to have no problem taking money from the government.  The narrator is a Reverend and the main people they interview always seem to be religious conservatives. What they don't explain is how it would be possible for the government to be fair to all religious groups, funding them equally and treating them the same. There are over 30,000 Christian denominations alone and a virtually limitless number of other religious belief that could all demand equal privileges. It seems like the only way not to discriminate against any of them and provide special treatment for one at the expense another is simply to not provide special treatment to any of them. The government should not persecute any of them either. It should remain neutral. People should have the right to believe what they wish, as long as they do not try to use their beliefs to take away the rights of others who disagree with them. That appears to be exactly what is happening with the argument that employers who do not believe in contraception should be able to prevent employees and even people in organizations indirectly affiliated with a religious group, from having health plans that cover contraception. They are basically arguing that employer religious beliefs trump employee religious beliefs. But, just like free speech rights, where you can't use your freedom of speech as a means of taking away other people's right to free speech, your belief against contraception can't be used to deprive other people of their right to make up their own minds.",1439510400,7,1767,4.909698996655519
