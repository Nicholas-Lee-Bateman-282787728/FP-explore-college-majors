8570700,5,B00BM8SV1E,A very good movie based on Swedish volunteers who served with the Finnish army during the Continuation war which took place during World War Two. The movie centers around a Finnish reconnaissance unit that included Finnish and later U.S. Army legend Alpo Marttinen. Marttinen immigrated to the U.S. after the war and served in the U.S. Army. The recon unit did many missions behind enemy lines and took many casualties in the process. You get to know the men personally. They were intelligent and had dreams like every other young man. The movie is not overdone and is well balanced. No unrealistic superhuman feats which are common in American war movies. It also has English subtitles. A fine display of courage shown by tiny Finland against the massive Red Army of the Soviet Union.,1481846400,,785,4.865671641791045
8570701,4,B00BM8SV1E,The movie has English subtitles. The actual true story is of certain Swedish volunteers who helped the Finns fight the Russians in 1942 when they invade (again) Finnland. Lots of action and very informative on how the Fins resisted the massive Russian invasion. Based on real persons and events.,1461888000,,295,5.040816326530612
