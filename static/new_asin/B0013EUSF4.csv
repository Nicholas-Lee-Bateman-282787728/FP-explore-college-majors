8250537,2,B0013EUSF4,"This is an amateur film, filmed in a restaurant.  That's not so bad in itself but the instructions are not good, too fast, and few tips are given in the methods used.  You just seem them do it very quickly and stir fry it up and then serve it to the customers who all say it's very good and they'll come back.  They show a list of ingredients for a dish for about 30 seconds and it's too much to write it all down.",1312329600,,414,3.9047619047619047
