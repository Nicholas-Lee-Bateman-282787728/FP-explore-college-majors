8408007,4,B003XF1UXA,"I also have this movie on a ""Mystery Classics"" disk, from Echo Bridge. The Mystery Classics version is almost unwatchable, the sound is so atrocious.

That's why I took a chance on buying this one, from Sinister Cinema. The sound is much better -- very listenable.

I love Patricia Farr's wisecracks in this movie. It's nice to hear them clearly, not in a haze of distortion.",1307318400,,375,4.666666666666667
