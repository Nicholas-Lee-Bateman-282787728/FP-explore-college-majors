7850967,3,6303534961,"A former reviewer (as of this writing, the only other review) seems to be in error. The package identified by this UPC contains five (not four) cassettes individually slipcased in a collective box:

1. Things to Come
2. Phantom Planet
3. Attack of the Giant Leeches
4. Metropolis
5. Crash of the Moons

I don't know if the reviewer has made a mistake, or the manufacturer/repackager simply uses the same UPC for multiple ""grab-bag"" packages. (But the former seems likely.)

I could talk about the movies: With two exceptions, they are grade-B pulp-style or space-opera sci-fi. At least one of them (Attack of the Giant Leeches) is bad enough to have been skewered on MST3K. That having been said, it DOES bear Roger Corman's imprimatur, and it does contain a fairly interesting human-interest subplot of romance and revengethough, as you might expect, it isn't given much development. The most interesting thing about it is that you can speculate, while viewing, about the writer's and/or director's thought processes as they keep attempting to figure out how to fit the rubber monster into the plot (it keeps bouncing in). The print or the film-to-tape transfer (or both) is poor-quality; it bears the appearance of a bad xerox copy. The footage of the monsters (there are more than one leech in this sucker) is so murky to begin with, it's almost impossible to tell from this transfer just what the thing looks like. I suspect that this works in its favor.

Phantom Planet involves an earth astronaut who crashes on a mysterious planet whose humanoid population seems weighted toward attractive females. At one point he has to battle a rival. And there's a captive monster who gets loose and must be dealt with. Enough said. The transfer is a little better than Leech.

Crash of the Moons is pretty similar to Phantom Planet, genre-wise. It's a 75-minute 1954 film, consisting of three consecutive episodes of the TV series Rocky Jones, Space Ranger. Together, they constitute a complete story. It should be noted that this movie can be downloaded for free (which may be true of the others in this package, as well).

I shouldn't have to say anything about Metropolis, Fritz Lang's ground-breaking classic. Except that there must be a better way to view it than in this mediocre film-to-tape transfer. As bad as it is, the film, itself, does not suffer, and the issues it deals with are timeless.

The same can be said, only more so, of Things To Come, the real gem of this collection. This H.G. Wells classic benefitted from Wells' direct involvement in story and script, though, sadly, he was undermined without artistic control over the final production. Even so, this is a movie that has received far less praise than its due. Even more than Metropolis, it's a masterpiece of artistic design. The lighting, the sets, the costumes, the montages are spellbinding. Over-dramatic, yes. But in the way a Shakepearean play might be yet still succeed artistically. This movie, alone, is worth the price of the package, and there might be some benefit derived from owning a physical copy of it rather than trying to watch a pixellated and much-interrupted version of it on YouTube.

As mentioned, above, there may be some confusion about the UPC, so if you order it, make sure, first, about what you're getting.",1451952000,,3309,4.885918003565062
