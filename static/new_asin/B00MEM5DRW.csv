8671813,5,B00MEM5DRW,"If not quite as brilliant as his 2003 masterpiece Los Angeles Plays Itself (now finally available on blu-ray and DVD and VERY worth seeing) this is still an insightful, very smart and entertaining look at how Hollywood both reflects and changes society. In this case how films with a leftist bent tried to get progressive social ideas across during the McCarthy era, as well as in the years just before and after that strange, dark time in our recent history.

Andersen divides the topics of the films and clips into areas like war, race , class and shows how communist and leftist writers tried to show their points of view, often views that while radical at the time, are seen as mainstream now (e.g. racial and sexual equality),  Andersen also manages to be empathetic to the blacklist victims without making the film into a study of their martyrdom.  That is worth exploring too, but here the focus is really on the attempt to add progressive ideas to Hollywoods then mostly mainstream-to-conservative bent.  The documentary is admirable, educational and very enjoyable.

As with Los Angeles Plays it was widely assumed that this film this would never see a mainstream release because of its non-stop use of film clips that would make licensing costs impossible. But somehow Anderson and his team have managed it, and these 2 terrific documentaries are now (or soon in the case of ""Red Hollywood"") to be available to a wide audience.  Thanks to Cinema Guild for getting these two important films out of the realm of bootlegs of terrible quality.",1416009600,22,1549,4.870722433460076
