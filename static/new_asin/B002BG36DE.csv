Well, for a start this is not a movie, certainly not one you would entertain the thought of going to the cinema to view.
Or for that matter as I have concluded, not worthy of a purchase or even a rental.

It has something to do with the Gumball Rally, a motoring event in Istanbul Turkey, but really nothing to do with that actual event features here.

What it looks like to me is that Mr Figgis has some form of connection with this rally or knows someone involved and was invited along to make a type of doco around the event. Appears made with a Video Camera!

So what we get is a kind of after hours portrayal of a competitor and his involvement with a young lady, Meeting her at a party.
Seems she is a little mixed up hence one of the warnings on the rating box of the DVD, but the reason of her let's say state, don't really come to light, nor does any further contact with this lass really make any sense.

The '18' rating must be for some reason that I did not see, but will no doubt encourage some to purchase this, what appears home movie of dubious intent. Certainly not entertainment.

Hopefully, another customer who purchases or views this, may be able to explain further?",1343088000,,1297,4.338842975206612
