1238328,5,B00000JSJ5,"This 6 volume set is a continuation of the exploits of veterinarian James Herriot who began practice in the Yorkshire dales of Great Britain in 1939.  It follows the books written by Herriot and carries a first rate cast including Christopher Timothy as the english vet and Robert Hardy as his partner, mentor, and occasional tormentor.
The subject matter, acting, and settings are first rate.  For those who have read Harriots books, these videos (produced by the BBC) will NOT be a disappointment.  It is, of course, helpful to have viewed series 1 since the program was filmed in the chronological sequence of Harriot's life, from his graduation through his marriage and later life.
I heartily recommend this series to anyone who loves animals or has an appreciation for english humor.  The films are laced generously with both.",974419200,47,831,5.0

1238331,5,B00000JSJ5,"ACGS Vol 2, like its predecessor, is a classic. Building beautifully on the opener, James and Helen grow into the practice, Tristan comes of age, and Siegfried keeps everything humming with his feverish energy.  And once  again, the delightful folk of the Dales provides the perfect supporting  cast.  My family is savoring this series like a choice meal.  Please  Amazon, where's #3?",949017600,7,384,5.112903225806452
1238332,5,B00000JSJ5,"Outstanding! Our family is long time fans of the James Harriet stories (books, TV, audio tapes and videos)and we have been patiently waiting for another set of videos to come out. When they arrived, we vowed to spread  out viewing them over a week or two and not all at once. Well, that didn't  happen. Once we started viewing, we just couldn't stop. The stories are a  unique mixture of humor, compassion and sometime sadness. It is hard to  imagine anyone not enjoying this set.",948585600,5,480,4.6117647058823525

1238334,5,B00000JSJ5,"This second set of All Creatures Great and Small videos is wonderful, just like the frist.  Robert Hardy's Siegfried is one of the greatest of all television performances.

1238341,5,B00000JSJ5,"Love this show which was on British tv and on US public tv. Not seen as much so the series is something you might want to have to review again and again. About English countryside veteranarians covering a period from before WWII and afterward. From the book of the same name by James Herriott, and his life taking care of farm animals, dogs and cats, and all sorts of pets, his life wth his employer, his wife, and various associates, as well as the countryside folk who have all sorts of unusual personalities. Wonderful.",1455494400,2,522,4.5638297872340425
1238342,5,B00000JSJ5,"Warm, witty, and charming stories, of  English country vet and rural setting. One of the things I enjoy the most about English television, versus American, is the production value, which lies in the wonderful stories, relationships, and characterizations. The way of life, of the English farmer in the Dales, at the time the stories are set (1930's-1950's) lends endless variety and adventure. I have also read all of Mr. Wight's books and thoroughly enjoyed them!",1454025600,2,464,5.1866666666666665

1238349,1,B00000JSJ5,"I'm sure that we would enjoy this DVD set just fine, assuming that the nicely packaged sealed set of DVD's were actually included within the plastic case.  Having ordered this season 2 collection for my wife who loved the season 1 series, I thought this would be a lovely Birthday gift.  Everything was going great until she opened the case to find no DVD's inside.  One would have thought that Amazon might check on these things prior to shipping.  So although my wife's Birthday surprise was a bust, I at least get to look forward to re-packaging the item, then finding a UPS drop box to make my return.",1429747200,,605,4.522935779816514
1238350,5,B00000JSJ5,"Read the books and although the series was made some 30 years ago, it is still funny, sad and heartwarming. It brings the people of York,and their animals to life, as well as the hardships of the times.",1428278400,,202,4.342105263157895

1238372,5,B00000JSJ5,"My sister and I have always loved this series. I can relate so well to the circumstances James faced day by day, the good and the not so good. It is so well done and the characters are so common to life. The married life of James and Helen is such a loving and tender story. The scenery is a delight. The picture quality is great. I don't think there is another series like it. Give it a try!",1392076800,,392,3.9746835443037973
1238373,5,B00000JSJ5,"Unfortunately, no subtitles, and the sound production could be better.  The video and sound production is not up to today's standards, so you might be a little disappointed in that, but this is the real thing, the actual episodes as broadcast all those years ago.  If you've never seen these, view one on line first before buying, if you can.  As I said, the production is not per today's standards.",1388880000,,399,4.671428571428572

1238376,5,B00000JSJ5,"Awww,  this is just the b.e.s.t.!  Have loved ACGAS since they first appeared.  It's so, so good to finally have them around to watch whenever I want.
A very good season.  All the characters have settled in and are comfortable with each other.  Building solid relationships with each other and with their community.  The laughs and tears are both tender and dear.  It's a great season to have because you won't have missed much and pick right up from the start of this season.
They'll never be another series like this one.  To be cherished.",1380758400,,541,4.621052631578947
1238377,5,B00000JSJ5,"For fans of James Herriot, this series is delightful! My only complaint is that it disappeared from availability before I could finish watching it. Perhaps an Amazon tactic to stimulate early purchase. If you have a chance to watch this series,you'll be pleasantly surprised and entertained!",1380412800,,291,5.3478260869565215
1238378,5,B00000JSJ5,Great acting and heartwarming stories. Continues more of the same terrific stories as the characters are further developed. James and Helen's relationship grows stronger.,1379548800,,170,6.125

1238380,5,B00000JSJ5,"Same review as for season 1. Just repeating as the feeling is the same. As today 9/12/13 only seasons 1 and 2 are available for viewing ion Amazon Prime,
Started reading these books in high school and fell in love. I have a love of animals, especially dogs. Finding these books as a young person pulled me into a wonderful world and culture I'd never experienced before, but somehow I felt I knew them. I followed the BBC series on PBS when ever I caught it on tv. I was delighted to see the series on Amazon Prime several weeks ago! It was wonderful and caught up on season one and then season two. The actors portrayal of the characters follow the books very closely and I love the chemistry of the ensemble. The books made me laugh and cry and always uplifted me. The programs have done the same.  So here is the sad part for me. Amazon shows seasons 3 through 7 in Prime however, they are not available for viewing. Ispeaking to customer care I was told that the BBC has the rights to the series and have pulled the remaining seasons 3-7. and probably had other plans for the seasons (whatever that means, the rep really had no other answer than that). You can BUY the series on DVD for around $250.00 however.",1378944000,,1214,4.348017621145375

1238384,4,B00000JSJ5,"I watched this series years ago, and have watched it several times over the years when I found it available.  The quality of the film or tape is fairly poor, but not unwatchable.  This is a warm, uplifting show with characters (based on actual people) we can like or respect.  It is nice to see shows where people aren't being cutting or disrespectful or viciously ""funny"".",1376611200,,373,4.621212121212121
1238385,5,B00000JSJ5,"All Creatures Great and Small is the quintessential escapism from a much too hectic, too busy world.  Finding something that elevates the concept of work as vocation, human failings and strengths, a simpler time ... perhaps ... perhaps not, is an antidote to the hurried world in which I live.  I was originally smitten by the characters, so beautifully drawn, and find them to be as strong as they were when I first watched the series.
The series, though not a copy of the books, is a faithful reproduction of their spirit.",1376265600,,524,4.684782608695652

1238393,5,B00000JSJ5,"In Series 2, the excellent cast of characters were firmly cemented in their individual roles and the interaction of those characters in the storylines is nothing less than perfection.  The Holiday show is especially touching and one that should not be missed.  I was very grateful to find this on DVD and the moment I saw it on Amazon, I bought it.  An interesting combination of British humor and drama showing the daily lives of those involved in a truly realistic and very human manner.

Great casting, great acting, great scenery, great writing and great characters.  If you're looking for action or bright lights, play a video game.  For good entertainment, this show has it all.  For fans of British television and Harry Potter, look for Dr. Who (Peter Davison) and Cornelius Fudge (Robert Hardy) as the Veterinarian Farnon brothers.",1369785600,,454,4.857142857142857

Fillmed in the late 70's, part of the original series, the cast brilliantly creates the world of James Herriot, a new veterinarian in a tradition-bound rural setting so lovely it becomes one of the viewer's favorite places he or she has never visited, but would like to!

The heavy local dialect made the series sometimes difficult to follow when first broadcast, but the excellent closed captions make the new viewing more meaningful than the first. In time, regionalisms start to make sense, the accent more understandable since you can read what they say, too. I recommend it even if you don't have a hearing impairment.

It must be unless unlike in the US actors can have the same first and last names.  If not then it must be him.  And of course Peter Davidson as so many of us know will be the Fifth Doctor in the Doctor Who Si-Fi show.  Anyway I recommend this series to others.  It's a nice cosy TV series.

Beautifully filmed in Britain the series takes place just prior to and into WWII. The life of a country vet with rich characters. Compelling stories of tragedy, Humor, compassion, and love of the animal kingdom as well as the harsh reality of controlling disease and the difficulty of raising livestock in pre war Britain. I grew up with this BBC series broadcast on public television, the only place you can get great programming. Truly a wonderful family show to watch together. No violence, obscenity, or innuendo to be had, I always feel better after watching an episode or two.",1265932800,,709,4.772357723577236
1238459,5,B00000JSJ5,"When James Herriot's first book came out decades ago, I was a neophyte book reviewer for a big city newspaper.  At the time, I predicted that the book would be a smash hit.  It surpassed any expectations my imagination could have conjured up.  Later, the British TV series picked up the ball and ran with it.
Whenever I'm down-in-the-dumps, I pick up the Series 2 collection and put on the Christmas at Skeldale House episode, which comprises all that is so heartwarming about the series, including the finding and bringing home of the Christmas tree, the healing of a little girl's beloved pony, and the gift of the mistletoe. If I were marooned on a desert island, this is one of the collections I would want with me.  One never tires of the evocative opening musical theme, nor of traveling to England's pre-WW II Yorkshire Dales to once more be in the presence of the irascible Siegfried, the dedicated James and his patient wife, the hormonal Tristan, and the Darrowby regulars, including Tricky Woo and Mrs. Pumphrey.

The series belongs in a space capsule so a thousand years from now, if civilization has survived, viewers can discover some of the best of times that existed before some of the worst of times.

Having grown up on a farm, I well recall the veterinarian's visits, so I should add a warning -- Be prepared: Impressionable young children may ask a lot of questions, such as, ""Why does that man have his hand inside the cow?"" or, in the birthing scenes,  ""How did that baby lamb get inside the mother?""  There is a scene of a horse being gelded, and also a few scenes of animals being euthanized.  They are low-key and not sensationalized, but could easily disturb a sensitive child, so parents may want to pre-view the series and decide whether they find such scenes suitable for child viewers, especially those prone to nightmares.  Aside of that, I can't think of a better introduction to the rewards of helping animals and being kind to them than the Herriot series.",1263686400,2,1990,4.692528735632184

The characters are authentic to the geography and I've been able to learn a lot about their particular dialect for a novel I'm writing. The scenery is incredible since outdoor scenes are shot on location. There is a good mix of humor and drama and I admire the fact that unlike so much Yank TV, the characters seem like people we all might know and aren't perfect looking model types (boring).

One of the things that impressed me most about this series is how authentic it seemed. No effort was spared to re-create the era before World War II. I was, however, deeply disappointed when Carol Drinkwater who played Helen, left the series later. Most reviews of this series fail to mention the characters of the dales, they are all outstanding. Although I have watched most all these episodes several times I am still entertained by these glorious stories.",1185148800,3,600,4.9504950495049505
1238468,5,B00000JSJ5,"Set in preWWII Yorkshire, this is the continuation of a series that generated 87 (!) episodes and three specials, and came back after an 8 year hiatus. If you are into action sequences and special effects, this is not a series for you, but if you enjoy beautiful scenery, fine acting, and are not troubled by the pace of a different age, these are the most satisfying examples of story-telling about real people and their animals. There are no scenes of existential ponderings, but the problems faced by the veterinarians of the day were not trivial, since livelihoods could depend on proper treatment. The attitude of these characters toward their vocation, and the prevailing disquiet in Europe as the war clouds mount, are about the only serious issues treated here, and I for one, found this to be balm for a viewer otherwise inundated with the crime, quiz and situation comedy shows of the time.

Though this be heresy, I enjoyed the series more than I enjoyed reading the books, which are not presented linearly in time, but as a series of disconnected episodes. There are also dozens of scenes in which the author does not appear and cannot have been a witness, so the mechanism for conveying this in the books is much less natural than in the teleplay. Having seen nearly every episode, the consistency of the cast and the presentation are a tribute to the painstaking production values, since there were numerous personnel changes behind the scenes (as well as the death of one cast member) over the long life of this production.

This series was transferred from 1978 era film, so I noticed a slightly greenish hue to shadows, blacks and lighting blurs that I noticed when I saw them originally (ca 1979-80). These were broadcast on Sunday evenings on PBS in my area, and they filled the time slot where Disney and Sullivan had held sway for many years. These are perfect for family viewing UNLESS you are 1) squeamish about seeing actors with their arms up a cow's backside, or 2) bothered by alcohol consumption. A character rarely enters the drawing room without a gin, whisky or sherry being poured, and many scenes are in pubs. This seemed perfectly natural to me, but I had seen plenty of period British TV by then. These are based on memoirs and the author was on hand to correct anything wrong, so I am happy that the series was not ""Disney-fied,"" and such scenes are proof (no pun intended). I cannot comment on the accuracy of the set decoration but I assume that it is scrupulous, since this is all within living memory of many of the participants. Except for the automobiles and brief references in dialogue, the time setting for this series would be difficult to determine; costumes would not look out of place on the streets of these villages today (maybe the occasional ""plus-fours"" would raise some eyebrows today). This gives this particular 2nd series a timeless quality.  The illusion that you are in homes and villages (as opposed to studios and ""location"" shots) was perfect for this viewer, especially the natural lighting.

This series does not carry the angst of the postwar episodes, but it does feature some of the most irritating clientele, as embodied by Mr Dimsdale and Miss Dooley. Mrs Pumphrey and Tricky Woo are back, and the explosive Robert Hardy is always fun to contrast against the otherwise subdued cast members. Sound quality is acceptable, but the 'Dales accent may be incomprehensible to some viewers and there are no captions, so the use of actors (and non-actors) with true Northern English accents can be a challenge for some ears. Fortunately the context is so clear that it seldom interferes with enjoyment.

If you love this series as much as I did, you will want to get ""James Herriot's Yorkshire,"" a walking and driving tour with Christopher Timothy, which was produced just after Herriot's death, as well as the longer ""specials"" (three) that spun from the show.",1170806400,5,3922,4.804444444444444

Now with 3 kids of my own it has been great to introduce them to my own children.  We bought series one and my 11 and 9 year olds were really eager to see series two.  For those people who want great family entertainment which showcases lots of countryside, animals, unusual characters and situation comedy with no swearing, sex or innuendo, then you should view All Creatures.

Series 2 is probably better than series 1 as the characters are all developed.  The acting is superb, especially Robert Hardy, who is by far the most accomplished actor as Siegried.  Peter Davison, as Tristan is the comedian of the group.

If you haven't seen All Creatures, buy Series 1 first then get series 2.  If you have seen series 1, then order series 2 now!",1142380800,14,888,4.432098765432099
1238473,5,B00000JSJ5,"Once again, BBC did a splendid job adapting James Herriot's books to television.  I cannot emphasize enough just how wonderfully done these shows are.  They're subtly funny, without that absurd need for exaggeration upon which most American shows depend for ""laughs.""  The lead actors -- Christopher Timothy (James Herriot), Robert Hardy (Siegfried Farnon), and Peter Davison (Tristan Farnon) -- play their characters so well, and stay true to the descriptions James Herriot gave in his books of each, that one immediately becomes fond of them.  There are also the fabulous performances of Mary Hignett (Mrs. Hall) and Carol Drinkwater (Helen Herriot), both of whom bring a warmth to their characters, and by doing so, create and immediate sympathy between actors and viewers.  Each of these shows is worth watching again and again, because each time they're watched, a subtle bit of interpretation, on the part of the actors, pops out, creating a richer experience for the viewer.  I heartily recommend the shows (at the very least, the first three seasons).  If one has any love for animals, England, nature, or pure, gentle comedy, these are certainly some of the best shows one can own.",1140220800,7,1190,5.103092783505154

1238476,5,B00000JSJ5,"This is the second series charting the life and times of vetenary surgeon James Herriot, based on the popular books. Charming, humourous, superbly acted throughout, and highly evocative of life in the Yorkshire Dales during the late '30's. Robert Hardy's towering performence as senior partner Seigfried and his sparring with younger Brother Tristan went a long way to making this series the gem it was.

With James now established as a partner in the practice following his marriage to Helen, this collection contains a hunt for a sheep killer in Lambing season, James meeting Granville Bennet, a successful small animal vet with a taste for the high life, James being tricked into taking part in a local cricket match against a terrifing fast bowler, Seigfried and Tristans hilarious attempts in a local quiz night, and many other magic moments.

1238477,4,B00000JSJ5,"The Production: The TV series ""All Creatures Great & Small"" started in Great Britain on January 1978 with no nonsense photography with the typical grain of that time period. This DVD box set is from the second season, which played in September through December 1978. Some photography scenes were taken direct off Yorkshire farms. There are very little special effects, the only ones I can think of is either drugged or fake animals to act out certain quick scenes. Were some of the animals trained to act like they were sick or dying? For example: This set shows a horse dying of lockjaw with the finishing effect of lying on the ground shaking. Sometimes certain operations were preformed with a human hand, checking the rear of certain animals for pregnancies or intestinal problems. At times when the actors themselves are seen performing inspections on the animals, their hands were either hidden behind the animals or the actors makes facial expressions with the lower parts of their bodies off the screen. Very down to Earth & as real as possible with great effect.

The Actors: Christopher Timothy plays James Herriot, a Scottish newly qualified Veterinarian as co-owner with Veterinarian Surgeon Siegfried Farnon, played by Robert Hardy, in the Yorkshire farming community of Darrowby during the 1930's. Veterinary student & Siegfried's younger brother Tristan, played by Peter Davison continues to miss things up, for example: blowing up a cow in one show. The housekeeper is Mrs. Hall, played by Mary Hignett. James wife & secretary for the entire business is Helen played by Carol Drinkwater.

Commentary: The second season is more even in plot & characters than the first season. Most shows deal with the brothers Siegfried & Tristan tricking James into volunteering for something they don't what to do. The whole Veterinary household will become a part of your family with their joys, sorrows, & adventures. As with the first season this box set comes with 4 DVD's: at three to four 50 to 55 minute programs per DVD.

There are two other DVD box sets, the first & third seasons, & a single DVD of 2 specials short in the mid 1980's. ""All Creatures Great & Small"" did return to British TV in the late 1980's with 4 seasons, & are now on DVD. A good buy if you're into real life comedy.",1073606400,45,2297,4.8396946564885495

The blessing of technology today has allowed me to ""catch up"" on this classic courtesy of the DVD's. I really found this ""world"" relaxing and mildly fun. It is the type of world I remember of sitting in front of a fire, smoking a pipe and perhaps some liquid refreshment at hand talking with friends for hours on end. That is what this show emulates among many visitations to professional veternary emergencies. The characters are lovable, memorable, and reflect a part of the ""polite world"" which unfortunately today no longer exists. The unhurried atmosphere and the natural beauty of the Yorkshire countryside combine with the lives of rich and poor and animals on the dales. I suggest you read the account by James Herriot first. There is a very good Reader's Digest edition with great illustrations that efficiently condenses and contains the best parts of Herriots original series of ""All Creatures Great and Small' books. This will aid you when you see the series because there are a lot of ""old world"" things that the book will aquaint you with (complete with illustrations that explain what the 'gadget"" was used for) and you will see in the show. So you will appreciate the effort of the producers of this series all the more. Robert Hardy is memorable there are also spot characters that make it a very entertaining and wonderful production. You will love this work if you like animals or nature. Well recommended.",1056585600,19,1557,4.79182156133829
1238480,5,B00000JSJ5,"My husband and I watched this many years ago. We read the books and loved them. Now that this is available on DVD I bought this for my husband as a birthday gift. We weren't sure the kids would like it, it isn't full of action and adventure, but they all LOVE it! They are 12, 13 and 7. Every night they all ask to watch another show or two - heartwarming, funny, interesting - what more does a family need in a show??",1038614400,8,418,3.988095238095238
1238481,5,B00000JSJ5,"I have been watching this show for many years and have never seen an episode I didn't like. The episodes in this series are some of the best. Each actor is wonderful! Christopher Timothy is great as James, Robert Hardy is super as Siegfried, Carol Drinkwater is terrific as Helen (as is Lynda Bellingham, who replaced her later on) and Peter Davison is fantastic, not to mention adorable, as Siegfried's ""little brother"", Tristan. The episodes are, as you might guess, full of animals - all of which also come under the heading of adorable. I cannot recommend ""All Creatures"" strongly enough!",1034553600,6,592,4.871287128712871
1238482,5,B00000JSJ5,"Having been born and brought up in the North of England around where the Herriot series is set I can attest to it's authenticity. Every village had a Gobber Newhouse, no one wanted to part with their hard earned cash but everyone wanted the best for their pets whatever size they were. We watched the original series in the U.K. and re-watched it on PBS while living in Massachusetts now we can watch the antics of Siegfried,Tristran and of course James whenever we want to. I shall purchase all four series when available and enjoy every minute.",1033344000,11,546,4.639175257731959

They are superior in their entertainment as well as their deeply moral message regarding family, friendship and personal responsibility.

I own series 1-5 and can't wait for series 6 to be released. I live in upstate NY and went to school in Sheffield England. One of the biggest reasons I went to school in the lower part of Yorkshire was the feeling I got reading James Herriot's stories. These are some of the best stories ever told.",1001635200,5,446,4.137931034482759
7913434,3,B00000JSJ5,"I am writing this review merely to bring attention to a matter which I find distressing, as I want to believe that if Amazon say, and if it is printed on the box, that these disks have closed captions, then they DO have closed captions. My wife and I love this whole series.  She spent six months at the beginning of WW2 in a tiny village of Keld, in Swaledale. And I have spent many summers in that most northern of the Yorkshire dales.  I bought this box of DVDs in the belief that we would have the help of closed captions.  In particular we find Robert Hardy, albeit he was a renowned actor, most difficult, now, to follow.  We watched the first hour yesterday evening and I was annoyed to find it has NO captioning.  The blurb on the box says it DOES have such captions.  I will retain these disks. It is too much bother to return them.  But others should be warned that, in a sense, the marketing of this box of DVDs is a cheat (probably not intentional, but the result of sloppiness).",1520812800,,991,4.267379679144385
