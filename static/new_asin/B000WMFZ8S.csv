But this UFO-DVD is ultimatic, not to forget was a fantastic gig in that ZOO... to be proud they should arrive in London next month.... For you and all your pleasure: Start at The Concert of Tom Mega in Cottbus/Germany 1994. Come for a sign to The Karies/Maki "" Leningrad Cowboys "" on Holsten Stage for free next weekend. And think about the Golden Age Pieces of Holsten. Drink Permanent Beer and think of: The nice taste without 0% is from Germany, a drink of its future. You can drink Beer in your car, even its forbidden in the US. But it`s a melange without Alcohol but substances going on waves. Believe! Original Aloe Vera is from Canary Islands/ Europe. BEER without a drug from Germany. Hey. Mr. Steven Drozd: Are You Alcoholic? Take other drugs beeing free. It`s necessary having the Flaming Lips for 40 years goin`round ... Don`t Drink, Smoke and use Drugs but be yourself. Steven... Wayne: Give him an Ellenbogen-check!!!",1306368000,,1028,4.653846153846154

that I did. Amazon says that it is no longer available, which is a shame as it might be the definitive Flaming Lips DVD (although I have not seen all of them.)  It documents a terrific 2006 performance by the band in their hometown of Oklahoma City, complete with more aliens, Santas,
confetti and balloons than you've ever seen at a ""rock"" concert, not to
mention a Paliament/Funkadelic-like UFO that the boys emerge from and depart in.  The songs and performances are excellent, the fans are well represented and the DVD really documents what a wonderful guy bandleader
Wayne Coyne is.  Grab it while you can.",1247270400,,686,4.60655737704918
