5186973,2,B008WAM2N8,"Picked up my copy of the Attitude Era early as my friend work at the video store, here's a summary of my thoughts, for the full review check out Tribalwrestling website.

The Attitude Era was great, but the DVD/Blu-Ray is average. My original rating was 3 star, but upon second viewing I decided that it did not justify that rating.

Updated Rating : I'll give it 2 stars because WWE pick poor matches and the boring documentary was too short at under an hour ( just 57 minutes to be exact). The documentary at only 1 hour, for one of the most dramatic era in history...very lazy and poor.

The irony is that the recent release WWE13 Video Game had better coverage of the best moments and matches during the Attitude Era, most of which are totally missing from the home video. (Rock vs Mankind I Quit Match, Undertaker vs Kane feud).

In the documentary, they often had comments about how the product was too edgy and not suited for children. It became annoying and felt like WWE was burying the Attitude Era to a certain extent. Maybe the WWE didn't want to put over how much better the product was, because it make their current product look inferior.

In fact there's not enough emphasis on how important the Attitude Era was to the company, saving the WWE from near bankcrupty in 1996 to become a public listed company in 1999. That's a pretty major transformation.

So what about the matches then?  The WWE failed to deliver the goods here too, with a mediocre selection of matches that was not wrestling classic or memorable moments. (Jeff Jarrett vs Dlo Brown?  Rock vs Val Venis? etc etc)

The classic matches that define the era that are missing (Triple H/Cactus Jack 2000, Undertaker/Mankind HIAC, Rock vs Austin).  How could you have an Attitdue Era Video without Kane/Undertaker, Austin/Rock ?

""You people have been led to believe that mediocrity is excellence""-Y2J August 1999

A summary of the good, funny and bad.

The Good

- No blurring of the WWF Logo! It is a more enjoyable experience.

- It's still fun and better than what's on WWE nowadays. There are some good matches debuting on DVD (Owen Hart vs Ken Shamrock)

The Funny

- Y2J Debut Segment promo where he shoot on the WWF (in character) is virtually what is really happening with the current WWE Product.

The Bad

- As mentioned, the documentary is just an hour long. Very lazy considering the great documentaries on recent release (CM Punk, Rock vs Cena). The lack of effort is clear.

- The match selection, many tag team matches that are not even that memorable.

Matches with lower card wrestlers nobody cares about (example are crash holly has two single matches featured. Plus Oddities vs Headbangers. )

Matches where I was thinking ""there's better matches involving these guys."". Example: Rock vs Val Venis, Stone Cold/Jim Ross vs HHH/Chyna were not the best showcase.

As a big fan of the Attitude Era, I am underwhelmed by the content. Thus my updated rating is 2 stars out of 5. I do not think the product is value for money as it was sloppy.  I will be selling my copy off on Ebay, not keeping this.",1353283200,56,3091,4.608775137111517

Overall, it's a mixed bag. The good is that all of the content here will be shown with the original WWF scratch logo and the word ""WWF"" will not be censored in the audio anymore. Plus, there are a lot of tv matches I haven't seen since they originally aired that are making their home video debut with this release. The bad, in my opinion, is that several Attitude era classic matches didn't make this release. Yes, they've been released on DVD numerous times before, but some of them have never been released on DVD or Blu-ray without having the WWF scratch logo censored. I'm talking about Undertaker vs Mankind in Hell in a Cell (a match that defines the Attitude Era, for good and bad, more than any other) and The Rock vs Mankind - I Quit Match for The WWF Title, just to name two. So, while the match selection isn't worth getting excited about, the documentary will contain a lot of classic clips. So, it's worth a buy, but in my opinion the greatest boom period in wrestling's history deserved a little more attention than this. This set arguably deserved a 4 or even the 6 disc treatment to truly deliver all the great moments and matches that made the Attitude Era so special.",1352678400,29,5205,4.365344467640918

5187089,5,B008WAM2N8,"This review is specifically for the blu-ray edition.

WWE releasing a compilation blu-ray set of the Attitude Era is something that I've wanted for quite some time, and now that it's been done (twice, actually) I'm very happy with the overall output! The first disc of this set has a very brief, although painless documentary about the Attitude era which runs only 57 minutes. This works as a neat introduction to the real meat and potatoes of this set, which is seven and a half hours of various matches and vignettes of the Attitude Era.

A lot of the matches are at the very least good, but the ones in the blu-ray Exclusives section (the entire selection encompassing only 85 minutes) are woefully short for the most part and overall pointless. There are two or three good matches in that section though, even if the longest match is only 12 minutes.

One complaint I have is that on the first disc, there are 24 matches/vignettes separate from the documenary, and these are the main reason you'd buy this set, right? I don't know if this was a horrendous oversight or moronically intentional, but there is NO Play All option. You literally have to sit there and watch each individual segment with the remote in hand, ready to quickly Arrow Down and move onto the next segment. To do this for 24 individual items is tedious; not to mention the menu screen itself has an overly loud metal song that restarts itself every single time you go to the menu. Thankfully, the second disc doesn't have this issue. The ""Play"" option plays the entire main feature of the second disc, which is nine matches and two vignettes long - totaling two hours and forty minutes. From start to finish, this was a GREAT set of segments, even if two of the matches very quickly (and I mean in less than five minutes) devolved into entertaining fun as opposed to presenting a clear winner (Too Cool vs. D'Lo and The Godfather literally becomes a party, Hardcore Holly vs. Crash Holly gets ""interrupted"" by about 6-8 other wrestlers vying for the Hardcore Championship under Crash's 24/7 condition). Otherwise, the Buried Alive match was an absolute highlight, as was Rikishi vs. Val Venis, the very first Tables, Ladders, and Chairs match and the six-man Hell In a Cell for the championship.

At the $20-22 price tag for eight and a half hours of nostalgic entertainment, you can't go wrong with this set. It's also worth noting that the WWF logo is NOT blurred out on this set, nor is the ""WWF"" dialogue bleeped or cut.

Of course, not EVERY moment you remember from the Attitude Era will be presented here....but that's why there is a Volume 2 released (which I have yet to see). Heck, WWE could release a 15-disc blu-ray set of the Attitude Era and I'm sure something will be missing. Just take what's presented and have a grand time with it.",1428624000,,2824,4.64

5187179,4,B008WAM2N8,This dvd can go both ways for me i enjoyed watching it but more matches that were actually good. The Val Venis and Rikishi match in my opinion didn't belong in the dvd. I fell they should've had one more hardcore match on the dvd. At the time the hardcore championship was what kept people at the edge of their seat. The best match in my opinion is the TLC match at summerslam 2000 with the Hardy Boyz vs The Dudley Boyz vs Edge and Christian.

5187184,5,B008WAM2N8,"Before we go all nuclear on this dvd for lacking certain key moments and the documentary portion not meeting up to crucially high standards, this is actually an enjoyable better than nothing entertainment of one of wrestling's finest hours. Do I think it could have been made better? Maybe. But the dvd could be a whole heck of a lot worse. I think of it as a huge puzzle peace and then aquiring the era's pay-per-views are the missing pieces. The huge redeeming factor is the WWF logo isn't censored. Great moments and a good dvd with some obscure moments of the era and it's a nice way to get us anticipated for a possible volume 2.",1394236800,,634,4.427350427350428
5187235,2,B008WAM2N8,"The main feature of this DVD set, the documentary, was highly disappointing.  It's hardly even an hour long and hardly adds any insight that we don't already know.  There is so much material from that era that I guess it's unfortunate to see WWE attempt to cram it all into such a short documentary.  After watching the doc, you'll feel like you wasted your time, unless you weren't around for the attitude era, in which case you might learn a little bit.

But for long-time fans looking to relive some of the classic moments from that era, you're better off skipping the documentary and just watching through the bonus features.  A lot of interesting moments and matches fill up the 2nd and 3rd discs, and attitude era fans could surely enjoy watching through a lot of that.",1393027200,,775,4.627737226277373

I would have enjoyed it more if we would have heard from more wrestlers that were in the Attitude Era but still pretty cool. I thought the extra promos/matches/interviews could have been better. I felt they didn't do that great of a job choosing the matches and promos to go on the DVD but there are some pretty cool rare/niche segments that were included.

Disc 1 Extras:
Most of what was chosen here wasn't really that special especially the Goldust/Marlena int. I thought they could have chosen something else to highlight Goldust. Whom has always been underated. I can think of so many other tv segments/promos that could replace these.

Disc 2 Extras""
Better than disc 1 extras but again WWE could have chosen better matches. LOVE that they included Chris Jericho's debut which to this day is still the best wrestling debut ever.

Disc 3 Extras:
Includes a few rare matches but again nothing super special. Had Chris Benoit not killed his family pretty sure one of his matches would be on here, horrible thing that was. Love they included TLC 2 on here, wouldve rather seen TLC 1 or TLC 4. Loved the inclusion of HHH interrupting Steph/Test wedding. Godfather/Too Cool segment was a great reminder of those 3.

The first time I heard that such a product existed, I was very ecstatic and couldn't wait to get my hands on it. Now having watched it, it felt like a total let down. On the plus side, there was a good, but also short, documentary, some very iconic matches and scenes, and, best of all, the old WWF logo is intact, unlike earlier DVDs, which just adds to the nostalgic feeling. Even with all the pluses, there's just too many forgettable matches that ruin the experience. This product had a lot of potential for awesomeness, but wasted most of it.

For example, why couldn't they do the 'Best of Raw' like they did with the 'Best of Nitro', even though no Sting? I gave up buying these dvd's after I read about the disappointing NWO dvd release.

5187352,3,B008WAM2N8,"I WANT so badly to recommend this, truly I do....but I simply cannot do so on the strength of the material presented to me.  The documentary managed to cram nearly 5+ years of wrestling history int barely less than an hour (57 Minutes or so). SO much was touched on.....and not expanded upon in the Doc.  As WWE is Hellbent on reminding people of their shining moment of Cultural relevence (This Documentary, Attitude Era nostalgia acts during RAW, WWE'13) it seems like they'd want to showcase more of it in the Feature Presentation rather than relegate damn near everything to ""Special Features"".

Also a Minor issue, The Special Features are NOT in chronological order, I realize it's a nitpick.....but it's something that didn't need to be done in the manner that it was/.",1357430400,,776,4.819548872180451

5187354,4,B008WAM2N8,"For years now, majority of wrestling fans have clamored for no other DVD set, more than one on the Attitude Era, and here it is! We finally got our wish! The Attitude Era was great, but this DVD is average to that. Like another reviewer mentioned on here, WWE 13 supplies you with more information and history lessons on the Attitude Era that the set fails to supply you with.

The documentary only lasts an hour in which different stars from the Attitude Era give their intake on it and the controversy that surrounded it. Honestly, this documentary should've been at least 2 hours, minimum. There was way too much about this era for it only to last an hour, not to mention each section of the documentary only lasts around 5-10 minutes, instead of really digging in deep to the topic.

When it comes to the matches/segments, most of them are okay in their own way but certain segments/matches that are on here are questionable to why they were on the disc in the first place, over other segments and matches that should've been on the DVD. Not to mention that there are certain matches on here that have been released on past DVDs, so why transfer them over to this one? (Ex. X-Pac joining DX, Stone Cold giving Vince McMahon a beer bath, Chris Jericho's debut). Another thing is the fact that stars such as The Rock, Steve Austin, and Triple H are used way too much on this DVD. None taken from them, as they contributed much to the Attitude Era, but they also should've saved room for other stars from the A.E era such as Val Venis, Mankind, Kane, Rikishi, Lita, Ken Shamrock, etc.

PLUS there's no mention or matches from the Kane/Undertaker feud, Rock/Mankind feud, Ministry/Corporation. To make up for it, you are given a few classic matches which includes the TLC match from SummerSlam 2000, Rock vs Mankind from Survivor Series 1998, the first and only 6 man Hell in a Cell match at Armageddon 2000, and a Four Corners Match featuring Undertaker and Steve Austin, Kane and Mankind, New Age Outlaws, and Owen Hart and The Rock.

All in all this is a semi great DVD, that could've been greater had WWE actually put time and effort into making this, instead of making loyal fans of the Attitude Era seem like the set was lazily put together. Nonetheless, I recommend this DVD just to add to your collection to at least have some sort of memory from the Attitude Era",1357171200,,2371,4.5456674473067915
5187365,3,B008WAM2N8,Felt like I was watching an extended trailer.  Plus no digital copy?  WWE definitely mailed it in on this one,1357084800,,109,4.4

5187368,1,B008WAM2N8,"I have been on the fence about this dvd since it came out and turns out i was right about not wanting it but i couldn't think of anything else to ask for for christimas. The only redeeming factors were the undertaker vs austin from raw 99,the 4 way tag team match and the tag team match with austin and mankind vs rock and undertaker other than that the other matches were a complete waste of time and space and to be honest boggles my mind why anyone thought putting these matches on this dvd would appease the attitude era fans,case in point to cool vs godfather and dlo,this match wasn't even a match,the hardcore title match was just people chasing crash everywhere,jarret vs dlo once again no one cared then they don't care now,the TLC and HIAC matches have been shown numerous times on other dvd sets.the moments made no sense at all most of them were pointless then and still make no sense. There was SOOOOOOOOOOOO many other matches and moments that deserved to be on here but were replaced by the same repeats weve seen again and again. The documentary was no better only running a hour and it appeared to just be thrown together over a weekend or so. Also very very little time is given to DX on the documentary or the extras which once again makes no sense given they're impact on the era same for austin and vince who were given no time at all on the extras and not even five minutes on the documentary. Overall i wish i could give this set a no stars cause thats what it deserves im sure if you wait you will find the good matches on other sets dow the road since thats how it allways works. Very very poor work WWE but hey i expected nothing less from a company who has a amazing track record dissapointing the fans",1356393600,,1729,4.323076923076923
5187369,4,B008WAM2N8,"If you're like me and you think the Attitude Era beats out any other era in WWE, including today, than this DVD is a must.  The first disc has a documentary about the Attitude Era, plus a bunch of interviews/segments from 1997-2000.  The next two discs feature some very memorable matches from 1998-2000.

 I started watching the WWF (yes I said WWF) in late 1999 so disc #3 brought back some very fond memories for me including the first TLC match, Crash Holly defending the Hardcore Championship 24/7, Mark Henry dating Mae Young, and the six-man Hell in a Cell match at Armaggedon 2000.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I thought the documentary could have been longer and more detailed.  Also, I recommend buying WWE 13 if you're an Attitude fanboy like me.",1356393600,,781,4.58273381294964

Not going to go into detail, as others explained it pretty well in other reviews.  While its not AWFUL, you get the sense that its a WWE PG Era view of the Attitude Era.  It also didn't help that some other key figures during that phase weren't brought in to make it special.  Also, I got the DVD version, and as a big WWE fan I can tell you that the matches are NOT the best they could have been.  With so many of these DVD's by WWE, i get the sense that they literally just throw on whatever they think looks good or fits in, when in reality, time should be taken to pick out the absolute perfect matches from this era.

5187379,2,B008WAM2N8,"This is another ambitious release by the WWE, but once again falls extremely short of expectations.  The Attitude Era is arguably the most famous era in the history of professional wrestling, and it deserves to have more than a 60 minute DVD dedicated to it.  Similar to NWO: The Revolution, this documentary is unorganized, and leaves out a lot of information.  Notable rivalries such as Triple H vs. The Rock, Undertaker vs. Kane, and Mankind vs. Triple H aren't mentioned at all, and the Austin vs. McMahon rivalry only accounts for a small fraction of the DVD's content.  Rather than telling detailed stories, the DVD only briefly touches on the various feuds, and seems to bounce between time frames.  For example, while seemingly discussing topics during the year 2000, multiple match and interview highlights are displayed from 1999 and 1998.  In addition, the bonus matches are lackluster with only a few being worthwhile.  There are a lot of great matches that could have been included on this DVD that would have better showcased the top stars' talent.  Also, some viewers may notice that in WWE's attempt to improve the video quality of the bonus matches, that the content is too sharp; In essence, they went overboard in the editing process to where camera flashes and dark shades distract the viewer.

Pros:
The WWF logo displayed throughout DVD
Some noteworthy bonus matches
Interviews from Jim Ross, Road D, Christian, and other undercard performers included

Cons:
Lack of substantial interviews from top stars or worthwhile interview content in general
Video quality of bonus matches
Unorganized information & lack of detail for story lines

Overall, this DVD is subpar and receives a generous 2 star rating.  Most diehard Attitude Era fans who know their history will be disappointed.  However, many individuals who are not as familiar will gain some exposure.",1355270400,,1878,5.078175895765472

I purchased this DVD at ""Worst"" Buy for the exclusive content (only available at ""Worst"" Buy.) The exclusive content isn't all that good & just a promo hype so you buy it from ""Worst"" Buy only. On to the DVD. The 1hr documentary of the Attitude Era DVD doesn't do justice. It should of been at least 2hrs. I wouldn't say they give you the best matches of the Attitude Era, but it's better then any of the matches from the PG Era of today. The matches that they put in here are mainly from Raw Is War & SmackDown. It was nice to see the WWF logos during the matches. Normally on old WWF matches WWE would block out all & any WWF logos. I do think WWE could of gave us better matchs of the Era, A longer documentary & better special features. What they gave was matches/content that was fair to good.

Naked divas, GTV, sex and violence.

5187383,4,B008WAM2N8,"Money, worldwide appeal, positive media coverage, ect...regardless of how you measure success, this was the most successful ""era"" in the World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment history because of it's characters, storylines, and production caught up to the times where the world was having a taste of ""Attitude.""  This is WWE's story of the company during what they called ""The Attitude Era"" of the late 90's to 2000 told by such talents as Mick Foley, Triple H, Pat Patterson, Jim Ross, Big Show, Mark Henry, Christian, Brian ""Road Dogg"" James, Rikishi, Stephanie McMahon, Ron ""Faarooq"" Simmons, Vince Russo, Steve Austin, John ""Bradshaw"" Layfield and archival commens from Eric Bischoff & Sean ""Val Venis"" Morley.  The biggest bonus here though is that there's no censorship here being a TV-14 presentation just like how WWE was during that era so you saw the middle fingers, the foul language (except what was beeped during the original airing), the only major edits being due to expired music rights (like Undertaker's Limp Bizkit ""Rollin'"" theme), and no blurring of logos or censoring references to the name ""WWF"".

The documentary begins briefly talking about the heavy slump that WWE was in during the mid 90's before Mick Foley talks about how the change in philosophy started with more freedom among the talents characters along with Vince's public announcement about their change before going into the change of look for RAW such as how important the entrance music & TitanTron became.  D-Genenation X was highlighted next as far as what their mentality was when it came to the antics they did with comments from others looking back now asking if they went too far with what they did followed by looking at the Austin/McMahon feud.  The effect of long term storylines were discussed next as far as how it created character depth & allowed the fans to have an emotional investment before going into the innovations as well including some that didn't end up working out like the Brawl For All followed by how WWE was reaching a demographics among young adults & women.  A big segment came next looking at some of the more edgy characters such as divas being more sexual, Godfather & his Ho Train, Val Venis' character, and Mark Henry's ""Sexual Chocolate"" character & talking about unexpected reactions he got as far as the ""Sammy"" incident before talking about the criticism they got in regards to their programming such as the Parents Television Council & how they had to tone down certain things due to outside factors such as sponsors.  The expansion of WWE television such as Sunday Night Heat & SmackDown was views & into the idea of using more comedy in their programming with such examples like Mae Young, Big Show's impression, stinkface, and the 24/7 Hardcore Title rule was discussed before talking about more various characters from the area such as A.P.A., The Brood, Kurt Angle, and The Rock.  The impact WWE was making in the media was another big chapter of this presentation when talking about the involvement of celebrities from sports & entertainment along with how the record setting ratings with the segments such as ""This Is Your Life"" before closing out the documentary looking at the end of the era & what changed after WWE bought WCW.

Matches Include:
Sable vs. Marc Mero - This was more of a segment than an actual match as Sable officially gave Marc Mero the boot on her way to becoming her own woman.
""RAW"" May '98

Brawl for All Match: Bart Gunn vs. Steve Williams - As explained in the documentary, this wasn't an actual wrestling match more than a boxing/amateur wrestling-inspired shoot fight where the superstars wore boxing gloves & got points for things like takedowns & most punches landed in one round.  This was the most famous match from this concept as it showed how dangerous it was to the talent with an injury occurring during the fight along with the crowds negative reaction to the contest.
""RAW"" July '98

Tag Team Champions Undertaker & Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Kane & Mankind vs. New Age Outlaws vs. The Rock & D'Lo Brown - This match showed the heavy amount of star power WWE had during this era as all of the current champions (WWE, I.C., Tag Team, European) where involved this one match as there was chaos before all the competitors came out & had multiple stories being told between not only the competition but also some of the partners who couldn't completely trust each other but overall was a big main event for that time with everyone getting their moment to shine at point.
""RAW"" Aug '98

Lions Den Match: Ken Shamrock vs. Owen Hart - This was another unique concept done during this time to capitalize on the growing popularity of MMA/UFC style of fighting along with the reputation both Ken Shamrock & Dan Severn brought to WWE as this match didn't even take place in the arena (Madison Square Garden) but The Theater next door inside of a octagon cage.  Dan Severn was in Owen's corner for this match as they fought a heavily submission based style while also resorting to tactics & moves to choke out or knockout their opponent such as using Owen's t-shirt for a choke, both thrown into the cage & the steel support beams holding it together & slammed onto the mat that had no give.  I can only recall two of these types of matches happening (the other one was the next year at SummerSlam with Shamrock vs. Steve Blackman) but it was a unique concept for it's time.
SummerSlam '98

WWF Championship Match: The Rock vs. Mankind - The finals of the ""Deadly Game"" tournament was best described by Jim Ross during the match when saying ""The Rock turned it up!"" because this was one of the times you saw The Rock get real aggressive in the ring against Mankind along with taking it outside the ring including various moments such as both men using chairs including Rock repeating slamming the chair onto the steel steps which were on top of Mankind & fighting on the announce tables. In the end, Vince McMahon gets his ""Corporate Champion"" using a finish that was complete ""deja vu"" before someone else McMahon screwed earlier in the night also makes his presence known.
Survivor Series '98
[The Rock: The Most Electrifying Man In Sports Entertainment]

Mankind & Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Undertaker & The Rock - This was more of a preview for the two main events at the upcoming ""Rock Bottom"" PPV as it was mostly a fight in the ring while brawling on the outside also happened from the ramp to ringside & in the crowd but the last image you saw definitely left a lasting impression in terms of the evolution of Undertaker's character during this time.
""RAW"" Dec '98

WWE Champion Undertaker vs. Steve Austin - A forgotten match between these two that FINALLY has made it's way to a DVD set as this was the rematch from the ""Over The Edge"" PPV 2 months earlier with the stipulation that if any members of the Corporate Ministry got involved in this match that Taker would forfeit the title to Austin while this was be Austin's last guaranteed shot at the championship.  Both men went back & forth early with Paul Bearer getting his shots in at ringside as Taker focused on Austin's head with strikes & moves like the reverse chinlock while also using things like the steel steps at ringside causing Austin to fight from behind.  This wasn't as much as a classic as their more famous matches like the ""Highway To Hell"" or ""End Of An Era"" encounters but it was definitely a forgotten match in their series for not only the finish but the bloody aftermath as well.
""RAW"" June '99

European & Intercontinental Champion D'Lo Brown vs. Jeff Jarrett - With D'Lo being the first man to hold both championships (Sorry Kurt Angle) by defeating Jarrett weeks earlier, this was their rematch with both titles on the line.  Before the match, Jarrett had his problem with Debra's ""puppies"" as he had been having for weeks causing her to end up in D'Lo's corner as both men went on to have a competitive match with some big moves like Jarrett working over D'Lo's arm with a top rope DDT arm breaker while Brown recovered with his own standing sitout powerbomb.  This match wasn't anything special or relevant in the history of the ""Attitude Era"" but was a good opening contest & showcase of the lower card during this period.
SummerSlam '99

Buried Alive Match: Tag Team Champion The Rock & Mankind vs. Undertaker & Big Show - Another lost & forgotten match FINALLY making it's way to DVD as this was the first (and to date, only) tag team version of this match. This was a non-stop brawl between the teams happened throughout the match everywhere from the ring to the grave, ringside, and backstage with everyone using whatever they could get their hands on such as shovels & chairs before other parties got involved who had one issue or another with the participants here including one person making his return afterwords to get revenge.  This wasn't the heavy quality we would get from the other Buried Alive matches but still a good match that was highlighted by Big Show tossing Mankind off the ramp & bouncing into the grave.
""SmackDown"" Sept '99

Steve Austin & Jim Ross vs. Triple H & Chyna - Don't let the title fool you as this was more of a segment leading into the ""No Holds Barred"" match between Austin & Triple as they were brawling non-stop all around the arena while Chyna was just beating the hell out of J.R. before another guy she had her recent problems with decided to take care of the dirty laundry.  Not much of a match but a fun brawl.
""RAW"" Oct '99

Godfather & D'Lo Brown vs. Too Cool - This was another case of it being more of a segment than a match as both teams where more concentrated on just having fun to the point where they decided to party before a happy couple shows up with an announcement that stopped the party dead in it's tracks.
""SmackDown"" Jan '00

WWE Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. Hardcore Holly - The only purpose of this was to showcase the chaos that occurred with the Hardcore championship during this time with the 24/7 rule as ""Elroy Jetson"" had everyone coming after him yet somehow able to keep escaping earning his nickname ""Houdini Of Hardcore.""
""RAW"" Mar '00
[WWF Hardcore]

European Champion Chris Jericho vs. Eddie Guerrero - This happened the night after WrestleMania as Eddie Guerrero was chasing after Chyna for weeks who also just happened to be Chris Jericho's associate as well.  The match itself wasn't on the level of their past WCW & future WWE matches but still very competitive for what it was with both men going past paced & hitting some moves with heavy impact but this was all about the beginning of the ""Latino Heat"" character Eddie would have throughout his WWE career as far as his entertainment value from the pre-match promo & post match antics while also constantly making references towards ""mamacita"" Chyna.

[Viva La Raza: The Legacy Of Eddie Guerrero]

Steel Cage Match: Intercontinental Champion Val Venis vs. Rikishi - Their feud got so intense over the past month along with Rikishi having his problems with Tazz constantly attacking him from behind for weeks that it got settled her in the steel cage as this type of match really brought out more a more aggressive side of Val Venis has he used the cage to his advantage while also coming up with an effective counter to the stinkface followed by a clothesline that turned the big man inside out.  Both men took some hard hits such as falling off the top rope & being crotched on the ropes while Val ended up bleeding above his eye & Trish Stratus slamming the door in Rikishi's face before Trish ended up taking a ""whippin'"" of her own.  This was a good back & forth match overall but memorable overall for what happened when Rikishi when he made his way to the top of the cage.
Fully Loaded '00

T.L.C. Match: Tag Team Championship Edge & Christian vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Dudley Boyz - T.L.C. Match: WWE Tag Team Champions Edge & Christian vs. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz - This was the first ever T.L.C. match which is the same concept as a ladder match except tables & chairs were also legal & encouraged to be used as well while it should also be noted that this was a homecoming for the Hardy's with them being from North Carolina. You had various crazy moments with all three weapons being legal such as Edge legsweeping both Devon & Matt off ladder, Bubba powerbombing Christian off a ladder, Edge pushing Jeff off a ladder that caused another ladder to catapult into Matt's face, Christian getting a 3D through a table, Edge hitting everyone in sight with a chair, Christian launched into Edge who was sandwiched in between a ladder, Jeff's swanton bomb off a ladder through tables, Bubba going off a ladder in the ring through stacked tables on the outside, Lita getting involved & paying for it, Matt falling backwards off a ladder out of the ring through tables, and Devon & Jeff hanging from the tag titles. This was a ""car crash"" that took your breathe away.

[The Ladder Match; Hardy Boys: Leap Of Faith; Allied Powers: Wrestling's Greatest Tag Teams]

WWE Champion Kurt Angle vs. Steve Austin vs. The Rock vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H vs. Rikishi - This was the first (and to date, only) time that we had a multiple men competing in a cell match with Kurt Angle making himself the odd man out by attacking everyone at some point in the week leading up to this match. This match was exactly what you expected with all of these men here in that it was absolutely all over the place with all four of these men but things got even crazier with Mr. McMahon (who didn't want this match to happen) coming to ringside with a truck attempting to take down the cell piece by piece but only got as far as ripping the door off the cell. Other various highlights & moments happened throughout the match like Triple H's head bring grinded across the all four sides of the cell causing him to bleed, everyone escaping the cell & brawling all over the set with Triple H having ""the boom"" dropped on him & catapulted onto a car while Austin went headfirst through the a window, Taker & Angle brawling at ringside with the ringbell hammer being used, and fighting on top of the cell with someone getting a stunner while someone else took the fall off the cage, and action in the ring that really picked up when Rock & Austin locked eyes in the ring. This can be perfectly summed up with Lawler's comment at the end, ""Look at all this carnage!""
As a side note, Undertaker's theme music has been changed due no longer owning the rights to the song ""Rollin'.""
Armageddon '00
[Hell In A Cell]

(Blu-Ray) Ken Shamrock vs. Triple H vs. Owen Hart - This was known as a ""King Of Kings"" match as all three men here were previous King Of The Ring winners but this also had a bigger issue as Owen had his issues with Triple H for months while also put out Shamrock with injury weeks earlier when he joined The Nation causing Shamrock to start the match early jumping Owen from behind.  The action here was truly ""every man for himself"" as everyone was fighting each other with no alliances leading to some moments like a triple sleeper before it was broken up into a double jawbreaker, Shamrock's ankle being targeted by both men, and the involvement of DX & The Nation factions.  This was an action packed match.
""RAW"" June '98

(Blu-Ray) Oddities vs. Headbangers - This was short & nothing special past showing the crossover appeal of WWF at this time as the Insane Clown Posse performed the Oddities' theme song.
""RAW"" Sept '98

(Blu-Ray) No Disqualification Match: The Rock vs. Val Venis - This issue came about with Val Venis ""wearing"" Mankind's sock puppet gift to The Rock in ""Mr. Rocko"" & we got a special pre-match classic moment between Rock & Mankind.  Both men took advantage of the No DQ rule as they were fighting ringside to the stage & the front row while also being very entertaining with the ""guest commentary"" from both men during the match as well as an introduction to ""Mr. Tableo"" in what overall was a back & forth match.
""SmackDown"" Oct '99

(Blu-Ray) Elimination Match: Steve Austin, The Rock, Kane, Shane McMahon vs. D-Generation X - This was one of those matches that look star-studded on paper but wasn't the high quality match that you would expect but still overall a fun match to watch that told various stories & built towards the matches headed into the Survivor Series that year such as the interaction between Kane & X-Pac, HHH & Austin & Rock & Vince McMahon, and the story of one team fighting from behind against the odds.
""SmackDown"" Nov '99

(Blu-Ray) Hardcore Champion Crash Holly vs. Al Snow - This was the typical hardcore match that occurred during this time as it was mostly brawling with a heavy amount of weapons either being pulled from under the ring or grabbed around ringside such as trash cans, a popcorn tray, broom, chair, and a bowling ball that led to a ""strike with nothing to spare"" but was overall about the other major element involving this title during this time which was taking advantage of the 24/7 rule.
""SmackDown"" June '00

(Blu-Ray) Hardy Boyz & Lita vs. Perry Saturn, Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko - Matt Hardy said it himself in interviews that the Hardy Boyz & Lita were the innovators of the intergender mixed tag team match which was obvious here as Lita wasn't out of place during this match with her high flying & lucha libre influenced offense but the story here was that during this time that Dean Malenko had a heavy obsession over Lita to the point where he got into a shoving match with one partner when he shoved her down & showed concern after the match because she was hit with a high impact move.
""SmackDown"" Nov '00

(Blu-Ray) Chris Jericho & The Dudley Boyz vs. Kurt Angle, Edge, Christian - This happened during a Christmas episode of RAW with Kurt Angle having his brother & cousins at ringside as this was a fun non-stop match overall with someone unexpected going through the table.
""RAW"" Dec '00

(Best Buy Edition) Womens Champion Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley vs. Lita - Stephanie would be stripped of the championship if anyone from D-Generation X gets involved in what was a very short match that was more about who did end up helping Stephanie that made Triple H smile watching backstage only for it to be erased for what happened after the match.
""RAW"" June '00

(Best Buy Edition) Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz - Both teams went back & forth with their trademark individual & double team offense before various outside parties decided to get involved from someone taking offense to ""GET THE TABLES!"" to someone eventually getting put through a table but the unexpected circumstances of how it happened.

Blu-Ray extras include Mark Henry finding the truth about Chyna's friend ""Sammy"" plus the unholy union of Stephanie McMahon & Undertaker.  Best Buy exclusives include a GTV segment with Al Snow & Head & Mae Young giving birth.

Overall the documentary only lasted around an hour & was just an overview of this entire time period without going into many specifics of things but the story behind different parts of this era has already been told on so many different DVD sets that I didn't mind it here as they did talk about other things & gave the spotlight to other talents that hasn't been covered in any other DVD sets.  I have mixed feelings about the bonus material as it didn't just focus on JUST the main event talents that are remembered during this time (Rock, Austin, DX, HHH) but all levels of talent including the opening & mid-card superstars as well as featuring more rare matches from ""RAW"" & ""SmackDown"" instead of using the same matches from this era we've seen released so many times before but there are still some lost gems from this period that haven't made it to DVD yet that were better quality than some of the matches they put here.  In the end, I can't change the DVD set so I have to just take it as it is & I was able to enjoy it overall so I would recommend this for those who liked the ""Attitude Era"" as a whole but if you only liked it for certain talents or other specific things (Austin, Rock, the Monday Night War, various moments from RAW & SmackDown) then I would recommend looking for those DVD sets before this one.",1354492800,4,21258,4.636629452418926

5187388,2,B008WAM2N8,"I'm only gonna talk about the Documentary itself, because let's face it, we're not buying this for the extras. To me, this seem more like a quick review of the Attitude Era instead of a real in-depth documentary that we all wanted. Instead of behind-the-scenes interviews that reveal what went on behind the titan-tron, we get superstars talking about how great certain matches were and discussing the how great the wrestlers were at that time. Sure, you get a few behind-the-scenes tidbits here and there, but I feel that they were too scattered.

Instead of telling the Attitude Era from start to finish, they chose to talk about varied subjects in what almost seems like in random order. Throughout the entire less-then-an-hour film, the superstars are constantly saying how they were too edgy, and how they weren't for kids, despite admitting several times that they weren't marketing towards kids at the time.

Overall I feel this was a quickly put together film that's missing so much of what us fans want. I would recommend watching this to anybody who lived through and enjoyed the Attitude Era, as it does bring back fond memories, but I would wait until the Netflix release.",1353974400,20,1184,4.885572139303482

5187390,2,B008WAM2N8,"The story portion of the DVD could have been great. With the amount of footage WWE has, they could have easily put together a timeline from 1997-2001 of some of the bigger storylines, matches, and developments from the Attitude Era. Instead it seemed as if their goal was to cram every piece of 'edgy' material into an hour with current superstars commenting on it. Sure they briefly covered ""This is your life"" from RAW and the Taker/Mankind HIAC match, some of the defining moments of that era, but plenty of other DVDs have done so as well. It felt lazy and rushed, and I wouldn't recommend this DVD to anyone.",1353542400,18,613,4.581818181818182
5187391,5,B008WAM2N8,"Just got done watching this and for the most part, I enjoyed it. They covered everything that was great about this era while at the same time, leaving some great stuff out.

Disc 1 is just a documentary. But it's not as long as WWE's usual documentaries. It's a letdown for me as I expected more. They could have covered the entire era (or at least more than they ended up covering) in just a little over 2 hours. But this is pretty much like The Streak documentary where a narrator talks and then some guys give a comment. That's really it. by the way, it was great seeing Road Dogg and Vince Russo on here. I did like what they covered (I'm only gonna cover things I liked a lot or things I felt should've been included):

The Birth of Attitude

Entrance Music - The Outlaws & The Brood were really covered here for the most part. But they left some great entrances out. Most notably, The Undertaker's which is known as the greatest entrance in WWE. Edge's Tortured Soul entrance would've fit great here too.

D-Generation X - Their antics and what they brought to the era was covered extensively.

Austin vs. McMahon - This was the rivalry that really captivated The Attitude Era so I did expect them to cover some of the more memorable moments here. Zamboni 3:16, Bedpan Mcmahon, cement on Vince's Corvette car, The Beer Truck stuff, among others.

Long-Arching Stories - They really missed the boat in my opinion here. The Taker/Kane story was shown. But they missed Taker/Mankind, Taker/Austin, Austin/HHH, Mankind/HHH, Mankind/Rock, Rock/HHH, Shamrock/Nation (well Rock for the most part)

Watershed Period

Debuts would've been a nice addition (Kane had a very memorable one) as well as certain gimmicks that caught on with the crowd. Gimmicks that fans or superstars wished would last longer (Kurrgan's Interrogator is one I wish went longer), matches that would've been great to see but never happened, and the superstars giving their thoughts on when they think the era started as well as when it ended as there's still a big debate on that.

Disc 1 Extras:

Jim Ross interviews Goldust & Marlena - Raw Nov 3, 1997 - This had to be the best heel turn in the career of Goldust. Glad this was here.

Steve Austin Throws the InterContinental Championship Off A Bridge - Raw Dec 15, 1997 - A very memorable segment. Great addition.

Soldier of Love - Raw May 4, 1998

Mr McMahon Presents Mankind with the WWE Hardcore Championship - Raw Nov 2, 1998

Jim Ross Interviews Triple H - Sunday Night Heat July 25, 1999

An Evening At The Friendly Tap - SmackDown! Jan 20, 2000

Mae Young and the Acolyte Protection Agency - SmackDown! Jan 27, 2000

""The Jug Band"" - Judgment Day 2000

Triple H Trains Trish Stratus - SmackDown! July 27, 2000 - Wow. I remember this. If I remember correctly, this is when problems started between HHH & Stephanie.

Edge's Totally Awesome Birthday - Raw Oct 30, 2000 - A VERY funny segment. If you wanna laugh, watch this! Only thing I wish they included here was HHH talking to FOley about making Kurt defend the Title and after taking Stephanie to the limo, HHH tells Kurt to get his gear cause he's in for a long night because Kurt's reaction got a laugh out of me.

The Rock's Message to His Hell in a Cell Opponents - Raw Dec 4, 2000 - One of the more entertaining Rock promos. Some of his stuff with Kevin Kelly should've been here though.

GTV - All I gotta say is I hated GTV. Thought it was a waste of time. If anything worth mentioning or showing happened, they could have just recapped or shown a replay instead of having this pointless thing. I know GTV was an ""on the moment without anyone knowing"" thing, but still kinda felt unnecessary to me.

Disc 2

Mike Tyson Joins DX - Raw Mar 2, 1998 - As great as this may have been, I would have been the Austin/Tyson segment over this one.

A New Beginning For D-Generation X - Raw March 30, 1998 - X-Pac's greatest promo in my opinion was right here!

Sable vs. ""Marvelous"" Marc Mero - Raw May 11, 1998 - I was amazed when I first saw this.

Nation of Degeneration - Raw July 6, 1998

Bart Gunn vs. ""Dr Death"" Steve Williams - Brawl for All Match - Raw July 27, 1998

The Undertaker & Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. Kane & Mankind vs. The New Age Outlaws vs. The Rock & Owen Hart - Four Corners Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship - I liked this match as it did whatever it needed to do and all the guys got a fair amount of ring time aside from Kane. All he did was tag himself in and after one chokeslam, pinned Taker to become the Tag Team Champions with Mankind. But that's all he really needed to do.

Ken Shamrock vs. Owen Hart - Lion's Den Match - SummerSlam 1998 - I didn't really like this match much. But that doesn't mean it wasn't bad.

The Rock vs. Mankind - Finals of WWE Championship Tournament - Survivor Series 1998 - This is where The Rock's heel turn took place and where ""Corporate Rock"" was born. This is also where the very memorable Mankind/Rock rivalry started.

The Rock & The Undertaker vs. Mankind & Stone Cold Steve Austin - Raw Dec 7, 1998 - The infamous and controversial segment where Taker hung Austin on the Taker symbol. Taker's theme and Druid chant, Jerry's commentary, Taker's eye rolling and statement that the only thing left is to bury Austin alive made this memorable for me.

Note: Something different happened here. On the original airing, they showed the shot of Taker rolling his eyes and raising his hands again. But here, they showed Taker walking to and touching the symbol or whatever he was doing instead. If you don't know what I'm talking about, watch the original segment on youtube right after (or right before) watching this.

Austin Gives The Corporation A Beer Bath - Raw March 22, 1999 - A memorable segment. But I found the one he did the Mcmahon & The Stooges in 98 a bit better.

The Undertaker vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin - Raw June 28, 1999 - Not their best bout. Their Summerslam match should've been here instead.

The Debut of Y2J - Raw Aug 9, 1999 - Just one of the memorable debuts of The Attitude Era (the other being Kane as I feel the era began around that time)

Disc 3

DLo Brown vs. Jeff Jarrett - European & Intercontinental Championship Match - SummerSlam 1999

The Rock & Mankind vs. The Undertaker & Big Show - Buried Alive Match for the WWE Tag Team Championship - SmackDown! Sept 9, 1999

Stone Cold & Jim Ross vs. Triple H & Chyna - Raw Oct 11, 1999

Boss Mans Sympathy for Big Shows Dad - Raw Nov 18, 1999 - They went too far here in my opinion. It was hard to watch this.

The Wedding of Stephanie McMahon & Andrew ""Test"" Martin - Raw Nov 29, 1999 - This one picked up when HHH interrupted.

The Godfather & DLo Brown vs. Too Cool - SmackDown Jan 27, 2000

Hardcore Holly vs. Crash Holly - WWE Hardcore Championship Match - Raw March 27, 2000

Chris Jericho vs. Eddie Guerrero - WWE Championship Match - Raw April 3, 2000

Rikishi vs. Val Venis - Steel Cage Match for the WWE Intercontinental Championship - Fully Loaded 2000 - This is really known only for Riskishi's impressive splash off the top of the cage. I don't know how Val survived this.

Edge & Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz - Tables, Ladders & Chairs Match for the World Tag Team Championship - SummerSlam 2000 - Belongs here. But TLC II does as well.

Kurt Angle vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin vs. The Rock vs. Undertaker vs. Triple H vs. Rikishi - Hell in A Cell Match for the WWE Championship - Armageddon 2000 - Good addition. But the HIAC matches between Taker/JHBK & Taker/Mankind were left out despite being more memorable.

Blu-ray Exclusives

King of Kings Match: Ken Shamrock vs. Triple H vs. Owen Hart Raw - June 29, 1998 - Didn't find this one all that great. Would've been better of it was HHH & Owen one on one.

Chris Jericho & The Dudley Boyz vs. Kurt Angle, Edge & Christian Raw - Dec 25, 2000

All in all, most of the matches included are great. But they left out the first two HIAC matches, Taker/Kane - Inferno match, Austin vs HBK - WM14, Mankind/Rock - I Quit match, among others.

This was the most disapointing DVD I have ever seen.

I was hoping for a longer, thoughtful, insightful well planned out documentary of the best era in wrestling and what I got was a rushed, non planned out DVD.  How can they do that?

To have a documentry on the most exciting era of wrestling ever at a shallow runtime of 57 minutes is a joke. I can tell this product was rushed with little planning. The documentry was not very good at all. Did not explain much, just some random attitude era clips.

I have also watched some of the bonus features, which are good. One problem though is you can not play all. You have to wait for the disc to load back to main menu. This gets frustrating since most of the clips so far have been 2-5 minutes. I don't want to go back to main menu after every short clip. Let me play all till I get tired.
