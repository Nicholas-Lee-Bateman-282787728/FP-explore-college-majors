7857191,4,6303920659,"Billy Drago (Secret Games, Mirror, Mirror III) has been making movies since the 80's. He has been type-casted as the bad guy because of the convincing talent he shows as being a character with sensual, subtle and psychotic menace. In ""Phoenix"" he displays some of this but also gets to stretch his talents by getting more air time. He shares this with two other actors, one, the high-profile Brad Dourif (veteran of over 50 films) and once-soap-star Stephen Nichols (The Glass Cage). There's plenty of action, a good storyline and suspense in this engaging sci-fi thriller. It's worth collecting for Mr. Drago fans and lovers of sci-fi/action.",990662400,3,643,5.018691588785047
