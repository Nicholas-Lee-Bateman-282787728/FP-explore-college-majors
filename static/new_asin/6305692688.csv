1063928,1,6305692688,"Well, here it is: the one sentence review of The 13th Warrior:  ""Brave Heart (a truly fabulous film) starts East, heads North, keeps the same supporting cast, trades Mel Gibson playing a Scot who is little  less than a legend for Antonio Banderas playing a Babylonian who is little  more than annoying, has a sub-plot and love interest that go absolutely  nowhere, trades kilts for bearskins, and tries desperately -- DESPERATELY  -- to keep its PG-13 rating.""  My apologies - I must continue to  bash this film; it's just that bad.  The script is miserable the action  sequences are irritating, and besides, what's up this fetish about  decapitation?  This movie is in every possible way inferior to Banderas'  The Mask of Zorro.  The only case that can be made for the one star I'm  forced to give The 13th Warrior is the scene in which Banderas' character  learns the Viking language.  If Mystery Science Theater were stilling  running, this film would inevitably end up on it, and go down as one of the  funnier episodes.",944265600,,1025,4.76

John McTiernan, one of the best Guy Movie directors ever (Die Hard, Predator, Red October), very much improved on Crichton's book. It's the updated, adapted take on Beowulf that Crichton -- who was a good idea man but a lousy writer -- intended. Brawny, lean, no-bs, muscular -- yet smart, the way all the best McT movies are.

Wife had not seen this movie which I think was one of his best.  It is certainly violent and not normally a date night movie, but we ordered up from Prime and enjoyed it.  I like the clash of cultures and how they are respectful but wary for the first part of the movie.  A great equalizer in any cultural issues is survival and soon Banderas as a scholarly Muslim and his Viking partners forget differences while dealing with a bigger, deadlier issue.  Little things stand out - how he slowly picks up the Viking language as they travel, - the way the circle up when they sleep.  I do wish there was more detail and attention to the groups leader who is presented as a great warrior but you only see him in action a couple of times.  Would have given more depth to why they all looked up to him so much and made the ending even better.  Well cast and believable action scenes.",1515628800,3,996,4.25531914893617

An Arab (Antonio Banderas) is indiscriminate in love. Caught in the act he is exiled along with his scrawny looking horse to Viking land. There he uses his unique abilities as the 13 Th warrior to give an edge in fighting the dragon.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yep the best slices and cuts are on the cutting room floor. At least the story line must have been left there. All that is left is a series of bloody encounters. Take the Vikings out of their furs and place them in Edwardian suits and you have ""Sleepy Hollow"" (1999). This movie has no resemblance to Beowulf and if any one says it does resemble Beowulf, you can be assured that they never read it. Oh! They both say ""worm.""

There is one redeeming value and that is the presence of Omar Sheriff who was in a better movie ""Oh! Heavenly Dog"" (1980) where he did not have to sit around looking dumb while waiting for the action. Actually Antonio Banderas was not too bad in ""The Mask of Zorro"" (1998) where he had a chance to act instead of slashing quasi-mythical bears.

If you took the blood away this movie would more resemble ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"" (1949) where Bing Crosby gets to ride his pony around the larger but slower Knights.",1504656000,,1345,5.04954954954955

1064832,5,6305692688,"Since I have read Beowulf in the original, I have to count this movie as a guilty pleasure. Once the movie's Beowulf stand-in reaches Denmark in response to King Hrothgar's appeal for help, there's little resemblance to the Old English epic. Instead of the monster Grendel and his vengeful mother, ""children of Cain"", whom Beowulf kills, we have the eaters of the dead - cannibals who wear bearskins. Ironically, the name Beowulf means ""wolf of the bees"", a kenning for bear.
And instead of the abnormally strong Beowulf killing two monster's alone, we have a band of Vikings organizing the defense of the village, and going after the raiders in their stronghold, as in Kurosawa's film The Seven Samurai. And there are some glaring inconsistencies (which I won't mention for fear of spoiling the film for other viewers), though they are essential for the film's plot. So why do I like the film so much?
First, it is a rousing action film, but a film in which the characters use their brains as well as brawn (an improvement over the Beowulf epic). Second, there is some real history mixed in with the fiction, and the film makers steal from good sources. Third, the Vikings in the film have personalities, and some of them are intelligent. They even have a sense of humor. Not Hollywood stereotypes - not a horned helmet in the lot.
For another variation on the Beowulf story, try John Gardner's book, Grendel, which tells the story (very sympathetically) from the monster's point of view. Unfortunately, that book has never been made into a movie.",1501286400,2,1548,4.801498127340824

Sure, but unless you are a career historian or a very finicky history buff, these fade into the background quite easily. The story and the characters grab your attention far more effectively, and the blend of historical fact (Ibn Fadhlan's real life journeys and embassages) and classic myth (our Beowulf stand-in Buliwyf facing Grendel/the Wendol and his/their mother) is as entertaining today as it was nearly 20 years ago. Though the budget of the film was an issue during its production, it's clear that it was money well spent, and the world of The 13th Warrior feels gritty and alive in ways that some of its contemporaries failed to achieve. The score by Jerry Goldsmith (who also scored that year's The Mummy) is a thrilling and inspiring work by itself, making the film shine.

While I speak, read, and understand German fluently I am an American and prefer to do my movie viewing in English.  I reasoned that it would be available with an English language soundtrack and that reasoning was correct.  My error was that I also thought that you could turn off any subtitles that might be provided.  This proved to be incorrect and is a problem hence the three (3) star rating.  The Blu-Ray recorded version provides excellent picture quality and clarity of viewing.  The movie is pure escapist enjoyment under an odd story line but has the elements that are, for me, enjoyable watching.  It would have received a five (5) star rating if the recording firm had only allowed for turning off the subtitles.  Why they thought that anyone viewing it in English would want German subtitles is more than I can fathom.  The Germans have it in a German soundtrack so why would a German want German subtitles?",1479772800,2,1045,4.66120218579235

1066197,1,6305692688,"I am absolutely shocked that this HORRIBLE movie has so many positive reviews! It is SO goofy! My boyfriend and I had been watching the tv series ""Vikings"" and were out of episodes so we went searching for movies about vikings and this was the only one with favorable reviews so we rented it. It was obvious we'd made a mistake within seconds of the movies beginning. It is almost childlike in it's silliness and the story is weak and boring. We literally burst out laughing when the ""scary"" monsters attacked, as they basically looked like muppets! At this point we finally turned it off, marveling that we'd stuck with it as long as we had. I mean seriously, are the reviews on this written by children? I'm absolutely mistified. DO NOT waste your $3.99 renting this - you will be sorely disappointed.",1458691200,,803,4.6223776223776225
1066198,5,6305692688,"I agree with the reviewer who asked ""What happened to this movie?"". I read Crichton's ""Eaters of the Dead"" a long time ago, and don't really remember the character development. However, there are at least two major loose ends. It's evident from the ""looks"" they gave each other that the queen of the viking village under siege has had a relationship with the viking king who came to the rescue. Also, the sniveling king's son was a complete waste of a character. Was he only there to have the tall Angus fight ... and die?  His character was a waste.  That being said, I still enjoyed the movie, only:  Why is there no US format Blu Ray version?",1458691200,9,645,4.4491525423728815
1066199,4,6305692688,"This is the best interpretation of the Beowulf legend that I have seen. Yes, it makes the narrator an Arab traveler, which is not traditional.

1066200,5,6305692688,"A well-made action film. Its narrative is mixture of two stories, one historical and one mythical. This first is the experience of a Muslim diplomat, Ibn Fadlan, who is sent to the Rus, a population of Viking-Slavs who settled along the Volga river in Russia. The second and most prominent story that is woven into the narrative of the film is that of the Anglo-Saxon epic poem Beowulf. Both stories are adapted loosely. The result is an awesome, if often historically inaccurate, adventure film.",1458259200,6,496,4.916666666666667

In many ways a silly movie, Banderas' lines are mostly hilariously badly written, lots of civilized vs barbarian grossout scenes, and potentially meaty plot bits glossed over or edited out. For all that, some good scenes, impressive horsemanship, and major heroics.  Break out the popcorn, pour some mead, and have an enjoyable evening.",1434153600,,468,5.077922077922078

You can finally enjoy this movie with extra resolution.  You will have to disable the subttitles that pop up initially.  The price is also merciful for an import.

The 13th Warrior, adapted from Eaters of the Dead by Michael Crichton, author of Jurassic Park, is a speculative take on the epic poem Beowulf, as told through the eyes of an Arabian ambassador to the Norsemen.
Along with the amazing battle scenes, rich costumes, sets, and locations, there are devices used to bridge the gap between the viewer and the Viking culture, that have seldom, if ever, been used in film before.
As long as you can forgive the casting choice of Antonio Banderas as the Arabian ambassador, his performance and everyone else's will leave you impressed and immersed in this legendary tale.",1427328000,,727,4.91869918699187

1068111,5,6305692688,"HOW IS THERE NOT A BLU-RAY EDITION, AND BETTER DVD VERSION, OF THIS INCREASINGLY CLASSIC MOVIE??!!!
EVERYTHING that all the people who love this movie have said is true; that and more. Banderas is amazingly convincing as an Arab poet-turned-ambassador, and all the Scandinavian supporting cast are great, Denis Storhoi in particular; hysterically funny. And for the doubters, it's all based on Michael Crichton's brilliant ""Eaters of the Dead,"" which was in turn based on the memoirs of Ahmed ibn Fadlan about his time as an ambassador from the Muslim empire to the north. And there were indeed, at the time and later, rumors that the Norsemen had had conflicts with peoples who, based on their descriptions and other details, may well have been surviving Neanderthals; whatever the case, it's just an ALMOST FORGOTTEN CLASSIC, and it would help people to understand it better if a package-set of a good DVD and a Blu-ray disc were to be put out. WHAT IT IS NOT, NOT, NOT, WIKIPEDIA NOTWITHSTANDING, IS A ""loose retelling of the Beowulf myth."" Where the hell did they get that? If you've read ibn Fadlan's book, which Penguin still publishes and you can get on Kindle, along with Crichton's, you know this to be a garbage assertion; lessens my faith in W'pedia. RIGHT NOW IT'S A CULT CLASSIC: ONE DAY IT WILL BE A FULL CLASSIC! So those of you watching Game of Thrones for the twentieth time, take two hours off and watch a REAL MOVIE ABOUT THE REAL MIDDLE AGES AND THE POSSIBLE EXPLANATIONS FOR ""FANTASY."" WATCH IT!",1422662400,,1516,4.768060836501901

I loved this extremely masculine movie, with some gore but it's necessary as part of the story.

1068449,5,6305692688,"One of my favorite movies of all time. I probably watch this once a year. I watch: The Griswold family vacation. Rudolph the red nosed reindeer (the original of course) A Christmas story (every kid wants a bb gun) and The Thirteenth Warrior! I know, right? Weird mixture. But I'm just trying to put it into perspective for you. It's one of the best.

A young Viking Prince; bold, strong, huge, arms like tree trunks...But as of yet unproven, is given a test of his manhood. He and his group of loyal friends, are called upon to go to the far north to help his fathers brother, his uncle ( a great king in his own right, but growing old )  fight off an enemy that has plagued the north for centuries. Monsters. Horrid cannibals. They come as ghosts. They kill everybody, remove the heads of their victims and disappear. The are called...The Eaters of The Dead.

The wise woman foretells that thirteen men must go on the quest...no more, no less. Of course twelve great Viking warriors volunteer at once...But the old one stops them in their celebration...One that goes must NOT BE A NORTH MAN. Poor Antonio Banderas. He just happens to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. He (unwillingly) gets picked to be THE thirteenth warrior. Antonio is a Muslim fallen from grace by committing adultery, and banished from his lavish lifestyle...ergo, his ticket to the north is sealed. At first the Vikings seem like giant white haired, blue eyed pigs..terrible in their strength and size...And unfortunately, manners as well.

After an arduous journey, they make it to the besieged town. The villagers stories of what they have come to face are terrifying.  Antonio learns honor and courage as he comes to be brothers with the rather unrefined North-men.. In the end he does a great service to show his love for his newfound  brothers (in particular, the future king of the Vikings) by writing the story of their fierce struggle with the monsters that in the end, takes the proud young princes life. The Vikings revere the written word. And to be immortalized in writing is a gift beyond wealth.",1413763200,5,2089,4.678474114441417

Better acting than I would have expected - fast story, great story, great cinematography, and good wins in the end. Didn't Michael Crichton write this? ""Eaters of the Dead""? I did not read the book, but the movie I am betting is as good, and possibly better, than the book.

The director shows how the prince and the wild Seamen work together to save their village from destruction by the last, savage remnants of the Mother Culture.

I am a huge fan of Crichtons novels,  and really enjoyed this short simple tale of the Norse people facing battle against a somewhat unknown enemy. The movie moves away from the book at some points(as movies must) but, still keeps the feeling of the story as well as the time and place where the story is set. My only problem with this film lies with the studios, who re cut the film, and fired McTiernan(uh Die Hard, anyone!!!!), while they sill managed to turn out a very entertaining film, I would love to see what the DIRECTOR of the damn picture wanted it to look like. I would also like some extra features, maybe have Sharif come on camera to apologize as well(I wish you would have STAYED retired)! It is clear the film has fans, and fans who would PAY for more from this film as a dvd or bluray product, so get to it Touchstone!!

The king of the village sends a messenger to ask for the help of a brave king from another part of the north country. A psychic tells him that 12 warriors must volunteer to go on the quest, then adds that a 13th must go as well, but that he must not be a Norseman/Viking. That is the set up. And off they go to meet with the king and vanquish the evil horde rampaging through the countryside. It is good action from start to finish, solid actors that I've never heard of before, plus Omar Sharif in a brief role.

So naturally after a suitable mourning period , I sent her a DVD of "" The 13th Warrior"". The sight of so many Nordic pumped up chests should uplift her soul.  While I'm told Bandaras hates this movie, I think it's his best and his supporting cast was marvelous.  Based on the book ""Eaters of The Dead"" by the late and much lamentated,Michael Chrichton it was in fact solidly based on an Arab manuscript detailing a diplomatic mission from Arabia to the Rus . So Antonios' guy ""Eben""  did in fact exist and lived among the Vikings for an extented period.

The music alone is haunting and the 12 Viking warriors are a delight . This is one of my favorite movies

Please do pay attention to the ""Red "" Irish Wolfhound, his name is Connor and he's a friend of mine ! He even sent me an autopawed photograph. He had the only heated tent on the set because the red dye removed the oil from his Wheaton coat .  So the cold rainy Vancover weather insured Connor of plenty of human company in his toasty tent !

1068904,4,6305692688,"I usually read books before watching the movies. In this case, I wish I'd never read the book because it was a dog! This film is better than the book it sprang from. The 13th Warrior is grand, escapist action at it's best.

The film begins when Ahmed (Antonio Banderas) is banished from his city for looking at another man's wife. The caliph, in order to appease the jealous husband, appoints Ahmed to be an ambassador to lands of the north. Along the rivers of present-day Russia, he encounters Norse traders observing the death of a chieftain. While there, a messenger comes to the chieftain's son, Bulvine, seeking his assistance.

The messenger tells the story of a nameless evil that preys upon the people of his father's kingdom. A witch is brought into their presence and ""rolls the bones"". In her interpretation of the message of the bones, she says 13 men must leave to go north to their homeland to fight this ageless evil. Men, beginning with Bulvine, volunteer for this hazardous trial. The witch then tells them the 13th warrior should be a stranger, non-Norse. All eyes look to Ahmed, the only stranger there! He is the 13th warrior!

Thus begins a journey to the north where these thirteen men must fight and defeat this great evil all men fear. The Norsemen show themselves to be smart, inventive, strong and brave. Surprising himself, Ahmed becomes an effective warrior by the end of the film. I don't do ""spoilers"", but I will say the movie is full of action and excitement, but doesn't showcase the kind of bloody special effects that have become the norm in film.

This is a good film in the action genre and more than that, because these men show themselves to be men of honor, courage and, when necessary, guile and wisdom. Antonio Banderas gives a fine performance - as does the entire cast in my opinion. This is a solid action flick and I recommend it with four stars.",1398470400,6,1893,4.625

I don't know what Omar Sharif is so embarrassed about.  Neither is it that great.  It was OK.  I was entertained for it's 102 minutes.  The movie cost $100 million dollars.  They didn't cut corners on the sets and locations.  I actually liked Antonio Banderas in this, normally I don't care for him (except in Mask of Zorro).  They deleted and/or quickly glossed over the most brutal aspects that were in the book regarding the Viking funeral - for that I am grateful.  I liked some of the other 12 (the Viking) actors.  The leader seemed a bit subdued and less fierce than what I pictured from the book.  Oh well.  Call this high budget, high quality cheese with a zippy lack of depth and substance.  It's almost like they were afraid to really develop the characters for being accused of having a movie that drags.  (The fear of action movie directors everywhere!  Gore Verbinski is the opposite of that, he needs to learn how to edit things down.) I bought 13th warrior DVD in used condition for 4 or 5 bucks including shipping.

1069022,4,6305692688,"Actually, I ended up really enjoying this film. It was like a an epic or a story told by a bard. Very romanticized. This film was apparently an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel called The Eaters of the Dead, which in itself is an adaptation of the legend of Beowulf. Thing is, I had no knowledge of the movie before I saw it. I prefer seeing movies that way, otherwise the expectations throw everything off. Keep in mind that a story told on film will never live up to a written story if you attempt to compare the two. Theses are two vastly different mediums, so to make the comparison between book and film is a major, but common fallacy.

In watching the film, it simply looked to be a ""hero's tale"", a legend. These things are rarely complex in nature. They are often more about exciting deeds, rescues, battles against good and evil, etc... This is what I picked up while watching the film and I came away from it really pleased with what I saw.

Yeah, there were a couple of hokey moments with Banderas, but his acting was surprisingly decent here.  It was all the other characters, the Viking/Norse characters that really made this film work. They were very believable and giving the audience their language and glimpse of that culture added depth to this tale that you usually do not see or read about in this kind of story.

The story was believable, not very complex nor did it have any surprises really. Considering this was basically a retelling of a heroic tale of grand deeds, sword fights, struggle for survival and such, this was okay. In fact it was more than okay. I found myself really getting caught up in what was happening. I really wanted certain characters to survive and was saddened when others did not. At the end of the film, I wanted more. And that rarely ever happens for me. Usually when a story is done, it is done, but I wanted to see more heroic tales and battles. Ah well, to me this means the film makers did their job well.",1395619200,,1966,4.437673130193906

1069026,5,6305692688,"The 13th Warrior is not your typical Hollywood fantasy film.  It is much, much more.

This story is an everyman journey - about a man shaped by his experiences in a foreign land. He's not the hero - he doesn't kill the bad guy. He doesn't get to have soaring romance, any more than one night. But his experiences have this authentic feel to them, unlike normal Hollywood action/fantasy movies. Just because a person crosses his path, like the washing girl, doesn't mean they stick with him through the whole show and are there to congratulate him in the end. Indeed, he has no idea how the many subplots going on around him get resolved in the end, and so neither do we. We just see the parts which he experienced, and take away from them what we will, about the strange land and its inhabitants. Many movie-goers (and critics) have come to expect all the subplots to be wrapped up and resolved in the end; but that's not realistic, and that's not what this movie delivers.

To enjoy The 13th Warrior requires more observation and more thought than most other movies of the genre, which is why I love it - and explains why others don't.",1394928000,,1136,4.478260869565218
1069160,5,6305692688,"As a fan of Crichton, I get very picky about screen adaptations of his books.  This is one that I can recommend.  Highly.  Liberties have been taken in some areas.  Example.  In one crucial sequence the attack by the Warriors was reversed.  (I am not going to give away which one...).  The Arab's facility with the Norse language was expanded for story arc completion.

The choice of Bandaras was a stroke of pure genus.  Sometimes one can find a list of actors considered for a part.  Bandaras was likely the only person on the list.

So, great movie (yah, I know about that ""loser""list it is on...blow it out...) great acting with a great screen adaptation...oh, yeah...and the best Beowolf movie ever made...

1069227,4,6305692688,"Ahmed Ibn Fahlan is drafted to join the Northmen (and they are called Northmen not Vikings) to defeat an unknown threat way up in what is probably Denmark. The historical Northmen (or Vikings) did indeed go down as far away as Baghdad, so that part is factual. But the rest is fictional with a nod to the legend of Beowulf. I have not read Crichton's novel, so I only know from what I know of history and what I saw in the film. This is a heroic fantasy, a quest to destroy what turns out not to be a fire serpent as they thought but an army of cannibal bear-men living in caves. The Northmen fight several battles and are ultimately victorious, but their king Buliwyf, dies in combat. What makes the film interesting is how Ahmed learns the Northmen's language, customs, and earns their respect, though he is an Arab. Ahmed learns to be a warrior and grows in stature during the course of the many battles, a lesson common in heroic fantasy epics. The film's greatest asset is the director allows the audience to get to know the characters. These Northmen are stoic warriors, proud but honorable, not pirates or savages or marauders. However the bear-men they fight are not given any scenes where the audience can know what they are, except for the briefest of scenes, deep in the cave where the Northmen go in to wipe them out. There is much violence in this film, several dark scenes in the caves, but I like the portrayal of the Northmen as heroes and as a people, people with their own way of life, who could respect a foreigner like Ahmed. A very good, enjoyable film.",1393804800,6,1574,4.46875

And yes, once again, I must award a full 5 star review for the effort given and the pleasure received at watching this film for the 14th time! Really - it's that good. Antonio Banderas is wonderful as the Arab scholar and true believer. A great evil besieges a land far away and he is chosen to accompany a group of the most courageous, fun-loving, most bad-ass ""Northmen"" to ever sail a dragon ship into the sunset. Note the use of Northmen not Norsemen, for the makers of the film wanted not to confuse, just entertain-which they do in remarkable and constant form. Fighting hundreds of savage men dressed like bears who wear bear heads and furs, use bear claws as weapons, and never leave one of their own on the battlefield, but always take the heads of those they kill, the 13 heroes must fight and sneak past them in order to find the source of their hatred for everyone else in the world! The Northman leader is a fantastic take on Beowulf, right down to the awesome, heroic, and absolute honest refrain of ""It's a good die to day,"" though he does not say it in the movie, but it is the attitude of all great heroes. His sword is 80 pounds of sharp-edged, 5 foot long, steel that can cut a man in half length-wise, in battle and he is the ultimate wielder of that awesome weapon. So: adventure, heroism, courage unequalled, attitude, and humor not your thing? Watch something else. BUT...if they are all the things you like in a movie, PLUS enough action to make your heart think you're running a marathon, and bloodshed not seen since ""The 300"", you will be counting the number of times you've watched this title and maybe - just maybe - you will beat my record (going on 15 this afternoon).",1388016000,,1787,4.451219512195122

I found it moving how Antonio's, Muslim Dignitary character, from the turn of the millennium  goes from distaste in his ambassadorship at the beginning of the movie to reverently writing its history by the end.

From there he hooks up with North men (and some of actors are from Scandinavia) on a quest to rid a small village of a terrible evil.  There's lot of battle sequences and small pockets of battlefield humor.  This, along with Timecop, King Arthur, Serenity, Dejavu, the One and yes I am even fond of Ballistic, another Banderas film.

This is one of those films that has moment to moment action consisting of grisly fight scenes of epic proportions.  There is some historical background in the oral and written sources on the Viking Sagas and Arab Written stories.  I have to admit that I am prejudicial toward any film that Antonio Banderas stars in.  This is a tale of an Arab man's journey through an adventure with a group of Vikings.  It is an extraordinary saga of mammoth proportions which keeps the audience on the edge of their collective seats!

1069755,5,6305692688,This is a heroic tale played out in epic fashion.  That they cut much of it is unfortunate but it still succeeds on multiple levels.  The actors are superb.  The dialogue matches the acting.  You want the characters to succeed.  They are battling an ancient evil against enormous odds and yet they face it head on with strength and intelligence.

This film could have be titled, HOW THE PICKS INVADED THE CENTER OF THE EARTH,and it would still have worked because of Bandaras's many acutely affective expressions. Bandaras has a fondness for the camera...and vice versa. No wonder Melanie Griffith married him...she has the same qualities. Not a great script but very good acting.",1377302400,,396,5.203125

1069845,4,6305692688,"I somewhere saw this movie back around the time it was made in 1999, then bought the VHS tape of this as soon as it was available, then the DVD so I consider myself to be a fan.
I recently read some interview with Omar Sharif where he said he hated being involved with this film and basically did it for the money. The other actors in it were great especially Dennis Storoi and Vladimir Kulich, and it's not their fault the directors and editor's chopped this film to bits, and it shows when watching it how badly it was pieced together.
I commented on someone else's review that the only way to correct this movie was to just do it over again, but that might be the worse thing that could ever happen. Have you seen the remakes of once great old movies remade that come out of Hollywood these day's?
Also, how could you replace this cast, it would be like replacing the cast of Jaws just because that shark looks so damn stupid now.
Maybe the best thing to do is leave it be and except it for what it is, a beautifully acted B movie with a very likable cast, including Omar Sharif.

1070036,5,6305692688,"There's a fortune to be made if ever John McTiernan's original cut of this astonishing  film is released. Ifirst saw it about ten years ago on DVD. I liked it well enough, but now know that my judgement had been clouded by my own expectations. I was expecting a lighter, easier, rollercoaster-type film (Touchstone pictures). My eye had been clouded by all the talk of the production troubles, so that I watched it with an unintentional half-eye looking for a film that wasn't there. Last week Iwas lucky enough to see it in a huge cinema in Paris as part of the Free John McTiernan campaign, and Isaw it for what it was. It is a masterpiece (with two weak special effect shots and a running time shorter than it should be).
In the years between my first and second viewing Ihad probably seen a dozen CGI films with swords and horses. The difference between them and this, is that McTiernan does it all for real. Real men on real horses in real danger in a real landscape. The 13th Warrior makes everything that came after it look like a child's video game.
The thing that impressed me most is his direction of the ensemble. Once the adventure gets going there isn't a false note in any of the performances. The strength of the ensemble is such that The Thirteen Warriors (with the possible exception of Banderas) are resolutely, and at all times, in period, and that's an achievement unmatched since the heyday of Kurosawa. (Kulich's performance ascends to a Mifune-mythic dimension). The ensemble, the behaviour and reactions of the characters within the period setting, is so strong that the film will never age. Unlike its peers, Lord of the Rings, etc... it will never look like a 90s film in dress-up costume. It will always look like a fine artistic representation/interpretation of the time. I loved the wood, the carvings, the ships, the doors, the jewels, the clothes, the mud, the rain, the blood, the fire, the deer on the edge of the frame, the thunder sound of real horses running. I loved the bear skins. I liked the awed truthfulness of the little Norwegian boy whose story starts forth the adventure. Iliked the feminine strength of the nurse who fixes Banderas's cuts (the right role for a woman in a boy's adventure story) and who reaches out a longing hand when his horse goes by. Iliked the black spider art of the Earth Mother in her web, guarded by the extra eyes of the heads of the dead.
It is a film that Hollywood should be boasting about. Please release the director's cut.

The DVD itself is fine, but the French blu-ray, Le 13&egrave;me guerrier, has much the best transfer.",1370131200,4,2604,4.634199134199134

I loved the Crichton novel even before the film was made, and I think the movie is a worthy adaptation, despite the troubles it went through to get made. The Norsemen (especially Buliwyf) are sublime; Ibn Fadlan (Banderas) is terrific. The settings, sets, and cinematography are perfect. Even the plot/concept are fascinating (thanks to Crichton, RIP).

What I don't understand is... where is the love for this cult classic? It had mediocre reviews upon release and did so-so in the box office. So what??? It was a marketing blunder, nothing more. A GREAT transfer to Blu-ray, including enhanced video and sound (which were already excellent) would be a huge hit amongst fans, and would pay off big time. I know SO many people who love this film. I would pay full price for a properly restored, modern Blu version of 13th Warrior, and I know many many others would too. Everything about this film is quality.

1070351,5,6305692688,"The 13th Warrior is one of a handful of re-watchable favorites.  I long ago read the 9th century Arab traveler's original account of his journey to the Northmen's lands and his adventures (which this movie is in part based on).  It is one of the prime sources for historical information of the Norse culture, specifically the Rus..the Vikings who went down through what is now Russia as far as Constantinople, and who ended up founding Kingdoms including Russia, to which they gave their name.  The early scene where the Vikings awake and pass around the basin of water is verbatim from the manuscript, as is the young man standing so they could see he was not a figment of the imagination from the mist, and the Viking king's burial.  Even the lead characters misery on the ship, where it was the custom evidently to laugh in the face of death when faced with a storm, comes from this historical manuscript.  The rest of the story comes from the book, Eaters of the Dead, which I enjoyed, and liked because of it's inclusion of the historical manuscripts information.  And the movie is very close to the book, which I like and which does not happen often enough.  The clash of the Neolithic people, i.e. the Eaters of the Dead, here, and the new comers actually happened much earlier, during the Kurgan invasions of Europe but the Wend in the book and movie are much more primitive and almost neanderthal rather than neolithic...still, it is not beyond the realm of belief that pockets of cro magnon or neanderthal might have existed still and lasted in legend.  The Norse legends are full of what we consider mythological beings, but elves, trolls, and such could have a basis in fact, according to some sources.  In the recent past it has been common to dismiss what was termed mythological as having no basis in fact because there were no written sources, but the tide is turning here, and historians are beginning to take another look.
  The action sequences are good, especially when combined with the superstitions rife at the time.  Even the Arab ambassador, who considers himself educated and 'modern', is a believer in them.  The characters are drawn from more than Norse sources....several Celts appear as well.  And the attitude of the warriors and even some of the things they say occurs in historical manuscripts.  I tend to prefer historically based movies with a strong historical base, which doesn't often happen in American movies.  I highly recommend this movie.",1354579200,,2481,4.802352941176471

1070437,4,6305692688,"There are few movies that I will constantly argue with my film buff friends about. This is one of them.

The poor box office performance of this film was a tragedy. This is a beautiful film with many subtle, but sublime moments.

The Viking's mission to rescue a besieged town from marauding Neanderthals is the backdrop for a story about Banderas's character becoming a man after being exiled from his life of luxury in Baghdad.

At first the gruff Norsemen have little respect for the educated Arab scholar who they have drafted as their 13th Warrior. However, the Viking chief quickly realizes that the Arab is very intelligent and he will make a valuable addition to the group.

There is a very moving scene where the Viking chief asks Banderas (away from the rest of his men) if he can ""draw sounds"". The Norseman was a good leader and a brave warrior, but he was illiterate, as many Europeans were during this period. The Viking is a quick study and is quickly able to repeat the writing that he has been shown. One of the hallmarks of a truly great leader is the ability to surround himself with smart and talented advisers. (And actually take their advice!) Later in the movie, the Arab scholar figures out where the Neanderthals are hiding. The Viking chief acts on his theory with out question. It is a scene that

The Vikings become a brutally efficient team as they try to reason out just who the nighttime raiders are that are attacking the Village. One of the deeper messages that I find in this film is the selfless bravery of the Norsemen. They all volunteered for this dangerous mission to save a remote town with no reward for themselves. They undertake this fight because their Code compels them to come to the aid of the weak. There is never any expectation of a reward of any kind. I have always felt that the strong and healthy have an obligation to protect the weak or unhealthy when they can. They know that they will be rewarded for their bravery in the afterlife, where they will eat and drink in Valhalla.

One final note. This movie is also recognized for it favorable portrayal of the Islamic Faith. Recent history and the actions of a small percentage of religious fanatics have poisoned the image of this faith who even President Bush said its' ""true teachings are good and peaceful"". Before the climactic battle, when the Neanderthals are riding in for their final charge, Banderas takes his boots off in the mud and prays to Allah. Not just for forgiveness for his deeds that he should not have done, but forgiveness for the things that he should have done, but did not.

Don't miss this film.",1351036800,,2626,4.598290598290598

1070439,5,6305692688,"An Arab is outcast from his country for having an affair with the wife of a nobleman. Ahmed ibn Fadlan (Antonio Banderas) is banished and sent north as an Ambassador and when the caravan he is in is attacked by raiders they are saved by the appearance of Vikings. He and his translator meet with the Vikings. They are going through a right of burying their dead king and the selection of a new one. A fight breaks out and the decision is soon made as the new king quickly slays his opponent for the throne. Buliwyf (Vladmir Kulich) is the new king and a great warrior.

While in the camp another Viking boat appears and a boy asks for the help of the Viking warriors to return and help defend his father's northern kingdom from the Wendol. They are an ancient horror feared by all. A witch called the Angle of Death who is an oracle is called forth and she uses bones to say that 13 men must go north and 12 Norsemen volunteer. A 13th warrior must go and he cannot be a Norseman and Ahmed is selected to go. The journey is long and dangerous but it is nothing when compared to the battle that will soon begin against a horrific enemy that none of them can imagine and no one has seen for over 100 years....

This is an excellent movie and it is based on the book written by Michael Crichton titled Eaters of the Dead. I liked the story line and the acting was well done. The movie is different than the book in several ways and frankly I liked the book better as the Wendol were just as evil but also vastly different than the characters in the movie.

The movie is still well worth watching and it is a good story. The battles are epic and interesting to watch as well as the appearance of the Wendol and the fire worm.

1070536,3,6305692688,"There have been many adaptations of the oldest known Anglo-Saxon poem, Beowulf, but interestingly enough, going into this film I was unaware that it was ""loosely inspired"" by the work and so failed to make the immediate connection.

Ahmed (Antonio Banderas) has been appointed as an Arab ambassador to the Vikings in the year AD 922. His presence in their encampment along with his interpreter Melchisidek (Omar Sharif) coincides with the arrival of a child prince from a distant colony that is being threatened by flesh-eating monsters. His pleas for the Vikings to assist them in this most desperate hour of need inspire courage in the men and at the suggestion of their oracle, who promises them success in their endeavor, twelve of them volunteer for the position, including Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich), their leader. The oracle warns them that the thirteenth warrior must be a foreigner, and so Ahmed is pressed into a situation he is unprepared for. He does not speak their language, nor know how to handle a broadsword, and their amusement at his ""tiny horse"" makes him something of an outcast.

On the journey, Ahmed listens to them speak until he starts to understand their dialect and by the time they reach foreign shores, is able to communicate with them enough that he makes a friend in Herger (Dennis Storhoi). They arrive to find the kingdom ill-defended against an adversary that is thought to be demons from the underworld. They come only at night when the mist arises and their dead simply vanish. They are also known for taking the severed heads of their fallen adversaries. The locals are frightened and the Vikings determined but uneasy... that night, the main hold is attacked and two of them slain. It is on the second fatal assault that Ahmad discerns that their rivals are not unholy creatures of hell but flesh and blood... which means they can be killed.

Though a more ""realistic"" approach to the source material and quite different in various respects from most adaptations of the ancient poem, The 13th Warrior is an interesting and epic tale full of interesting characters and exciting battle sequences. It was a box office failure and I can kind of understand why -- though Banderas is well known, most of his costars are not and there is a quality to the production that hints at its limited budget. The first twenty minutes or so suffer from moving slowly but then the pace picks up and we get to see some gorgeous cinematography. The acting is quite good and the filmmakers were clever in particular in allowing the audience to comprehend along with Ahmed what his companions are saying. It is enjoyable in spite of its faults but I did have a hard time emotionally connecting with most of the characters, which means there are not too many smaller moments to illustrate their different personalities (humorous instances in which Ahmed defends his beautiful white Arabian against their jeers notwithstanding). The style of filming is impressive and the costumes are quite good. It also captures very well the gritty, difficult circumstances of that era.

There is not much romance to speak of (although Ahmed does have some sweet scenes with a Viking girl) but my curiosity toward their enemies and my hope that everyone would survive kept me watching. It is a movie that might be too brutal for some female viewers but that most guys would probably enjoy, if they like the genre of historical epics. For the material, the content was handled fairly well and it's a decent approach to a story that has been told many times, but never quite with this much realism. Making the monster flesh and blood rather than a distant, tormented creature was a stroke of genius.",1332892800,3,3697,4.844936708860759

1070538,3,6305692688,"I love this movie and never get tired of watching it. It's not perfect, but who cares -- it's a lot of fun. Funny thing: friends of mine who would probably enjoy ""The 13th Warrior"" never bothered to see it because they were tired of Antonio Banderas, but frankly, I thought this was one of his best performances. He's not really the focus of the story, except from the ""stranger in a strange land"" angle, but he delivers a fine, understated performance. The stand-outs are the excellent, largely unknown actors portraying the intrepid band of North-men dispatched on a quest to vanquish the evil Wendol (who are tormenting a neighboring kingdom). The characterizations cover the whole personality spectrum, from the charismatic men-of-few-words such as the superb Vladimir Kulich as the leader, Buliwyf, and Daniel Southern as Egtho ""the Silent,"" to the cheerful and enthusiastic, embodied by the fine Tony Curran as Weath and Dennis Storhoi in a marvelous, central performance as the aptly-named Herger ""the Joyous.""

The battle scenes are exciting, and the climactic confrontation with the Wendol is reminiscent of Branagh's ""Henry V,"" right down to the rain and mud. The locations, shot in British Columbia, are gorgeous and evocative of a misty, ominous Scandinavian wilderness. The late Jerry Goldsmith accompanied the action with a stirring score, with an appropriately Wagnerian flavor in the last few scenes of the film.

No sex, no foul language, some gore (so be careful if there are kids in the room) -- and the rousing exploits of a group of warriors who, if ever there was a Valhalla, must be drinking mead and singing battle songs in it these days....

It has so many good scenes and such interesting concepts
that I just had to add this to my collection.
This is story about an Arab being shunned by his kind and sent to
the viking lands for having a roving eye on the queen.
Next, we see the arab in the middle of a tribal meeting.
It seems a messenger has arrived asking for help
to rid their village of an unknown menace.
He cannot understand their language, but his guide
relays what they say during this gathering.
Thirteen warriors are needed for this trip.
Guess who gets to be the Thirteenth Warrior"" to go?
Yes,there are some grisly scenes involved.
I definitely wouldn't let a 14 year old watch this movie.
What I loved about this movie:
1- It has Antonio Banderas in it.
2- Loved the landscape, gorgeous.
3- A great concept of clashing religions coming together
to fight the battle of ""The Eaters of The Dead"".
4. Loved the lessons of life learned all throughout
this movie.
An example of this goes as follows:
Arab sits each night at the fire and can only listen
and guess what they are speaking about.
One night, one warrior makes fun of Arab's mother,
and lo and behold Arab throws an insult right back at him.
In their own language! They are as you can guess, amazed.
How? They asked, how""?
His reply, ""I listened, I listened!"".
Now they are all on the ""same page"" , so to speak.
5. There ain't no way I would ever be able to survive
with the conditions they lived in!!(Where's my toilet)?
What I didn't like:
 1-Movie was way too short for me.
Me thinks they cut a lot out of the this tale.
2-The ""grisly"" parts, literally.

1070619,5,6305692688,"I was 18 when this movie came out in the theaters. I went to see it twice. Did I like it? No, I loved it. (cliche', I know) I won't go into the scores or rave about who was in it because if you are in my age range you don't know any one but Antonio Banderas any ways. The movie it self was great for me and I stress ME because I loved the purely brutal style of voilence. When some one gets killed you know that they are dead. Now I know a lot of people who read this will say ""its not that violent"" but for its time it was. You didn't get to see to many movies at the time where people died by sword like this. Later we got things like Gladiator and 300. I have read a lot of bad reviews about this movie (wich made me want to write a good one) because people sit here and say the story is weak sauce, the acting is bad, complaints about the lighting... really? I read reviews that complained about why they didn't use certain actors... any ways. Lets face it, if you read the title it should give you an idea about what you are going to see. i.e. Saving Private Ryan. Leaves a lot of the guess work out of what its about. So people sit and complain about it but if you didn't know what you were sitting down to thats your problem. Its a story, based on a book, and I will say loosely, names are about the only thing the same, about an Arab who joins up with Vikings against his wishs' and heads off to help a kingdom survive and fight off an ancient threat. Now... based on that, how many of you are surprised there are a few battle scenes? Or that there are a lot of deaths? How many ancient threats are out there in cinema that go away by singing and dancing? Right, so now we get that this is a movie about violence, death, killing, blood and gore. If you don't like those things this movie isn't for you. People have also said there is no story line here. I dissagree. The story is... well see above starting at Arab. Friendships are made and lost due to a few deaths. People fall in love, bla bla bla. Visually I loved the movie because I like that gloomy foggy mountainess look. I have no idea if Viking and Arabs of the kind existed in the same time frame or not, so if your an expert of such things, try and look past that. The people in the movie are likeable enough that you care if any of them die (if they got any screen time) other wise they just kind of go away in a battle scene and you go ""ok guess so and so died"" My one complaint are the names. You know Banderas as Arab or Ebin, and Bolvine spelled Boulfife or some such thing if you look in the credits but other than that I don't think they ever say any one elses name... well there is a part where the Arab is looking for the scout and calles him something to the effect of Ethal but thats not much to go by. For those of you who do happen to know actors and actress' Dont see this movie if you are only seeing it for Omar Sharif or Diane Venora. Thier roles are little more than Cameos. The movie is fun, not meant to be taken too serioulsy and enjoyed for what it is. Decent banter, good killing and credits.",1319500800,,3084,3.9919093851132685

...Holes left in the plot that you can drive a Viking longboat through.  The evil son of the king... he gets put on notice... then vanishes... The romance will not and can not last... but instead just vanishes...

...The leader of the warriors at first blush appears to be just another ""Gnorts the barbarian"" type... but we get a hint that he is far deeper when we discover that he is interested in literacy... but so much else on the cutting room floor... including the fact that his father was a carpenter.

...A wonderful retelling of the Beowulf story... scarred seemingly forever by petty ego and jealousy...  like somebody tearing off a third of a major painting.

My whole love for this movie stems from the portrayal of the Vikings. I love it. The movie, likely without realizing it too much, was excellent in its presentation of the Vikings. Most of the time these types of movies play out the stereotypical Viking caricatures; there is usually the big strong and dumb one. The big hearted one, the funny one, and so on. Not this film. All the Vikings were portrayed as competent. That any one of them was strong enough, intelligent enough, and wise enough to lead. I was profoundly struck by this. People may just key in on the battles and the typical medieval combat, but I loved all the lead up. Each individual's contribution. There was clearly a leader, but he certainly didn't behave like one. He was completely respected by the other Vikings, but he knew that everyone's part mattered and not is just a perfunctory way either. The way the Viking group worked together. So the next time you watch this or if it is your first time, remember this and you will likely have a greater appreciation for the movie and possibly gloss over any of the films faults. A truly unique and refreshing take from this angle. Enjoy.",1302739200,2,1319,4.546218487394958

I have watched this movie more than a dozen times and still find myself excited as the battles begin, and wishing that it could be longer just so that I could spend more time with the characters.

We also see how the scribe who wrote down the story many hundreds of years later brought his own agenda-Christianity-to the telling.  Now, rather than seeing the incredible, supernatural manuscript brought to life, we see how the manuscript COULD have been written, and the facts embellished.  This is, indeed, the most realistic and plausible telling of the great epic, Beowulf.  Each battle he faces, each creature, each supernatural event is shown how it could have ocurred, and the scribe is there in person, fighting alongside of him, bringing religion, in this case, the muslim faith, to the manuscript.

The contrast of the clean, fine Arabic sensibilities with the rough, crude European sensibilities are historically accurate and well used, leading to a little humor both for ibn Fadlan, in his role as the chronicler, and at his expense.

Somehow I missed seeing this movie way back when it originally came out, but we finally got around to it a few nights ago and I couldn't help but feel that the end result was mediocre at best.

For the first half, it feels like the movie is reaching pretty far for some good material - there's a realistic air of mysticism over everything, as good scenes like the boy standing in the mist and the fortune teller picking the thirteen destined warriors out of a crowd. A good balance is struck between the realism and mysticism, and the viewer is never quite sure which way the movie is going to fall. I also really appreciate that the Muslim emissary is treated by the movie with respect and dignity, and without really calling attention to how progressive this is - I do like that.

Unfortunately, all the points I liked get tossed over for a quick and dirty second half that seems determined to tramp all the good points into the ground as quickly as possible. In one swift motion, the movie chucks all the possible mysticism in favor of a realism that is so ridiculous as to be laughable: well, *of course* there's no such thing as dragons, that's stupid. Instead, there are hundreds (perhaps thousands?) of warriors on horseback. Warriors who wear bearskins...wow, that's a lot of bears to skin, isn't it? And the warriors live in caves. With...their...horses. Wait, what? No, no, the point is that it's not mystical, even though removal of the mystical elements makes everything we've seen so far stupid (Why do they eat dead people? They've got a life-time supply of bear meat for crying out loud.) and nonsensical.

And, because this is ""realism"", and we can't possibly have monsters, we'll need a villain. So, despite the fact that we've decided to treat Islam with a fair hand, let's just royally muck that up and slap imitation statues of the Venus of Willendorf everywhere, and declare the bad guys to be a druidic, goddess-worshipping cult who eat dead people and literally live to menace the nearby tiny village.

""Fiction"" shouldn't mean that a book or movie doesn't have to explain itself. The bad guys have no motive and their actions are nonsensical at best. The local village seems to exist for the sole purpose of being menaced, which makes even less sense. And the warriors themselves seem to cheerfully accept their ""destiny"" for no reason more than that the plot (and Honor Before Reason) compels them to do so. I think this could have been a good movie with a little more polish, but as it is, it feels distinctly rough around the edges.

I think the one thing that many people miss about this movie is the character development and cultural understanding and appreciation that occurs during the telling of the story.

My favorite line of the movie is: ""Fear profits man nothing!"", and it was propably the 3rd thime I watched it that I picked up on that line - it's said so matter of factly as part of the dialog that it's easy to miss.

A rich potpourri of European actors, seldom seen on American screens, adds to the exotic nature of this work.

Crichton based his story on old folk legends, and McTiernan fills the film with almost every fantasy/action-film cliche extant. It's all here: the chase scenes, the sword battles, the wayward glance at the maiden, the flaming arrows, the ever-growing pile of corpses, the shot of the moon through the mist, etc etc. And it all starts feeling forced pretty early on.

Banderas looks like a GQ-cover refugee most of the time: his make-up is caked on, as is his eye-shadow, even during fight scenes. Other characters may get dirty (or rather clearly Hollywood-fake-dirty), but Antonio remains film-star pretty all the way, even under attack. It's hard to buy into an action film when it looks like an ad for underarm deodorant.

The ""monsters"" as such are uninspired. The dialogue is oft laughable. Banderas is not believable in this role, though his Viking counterparts do have their moments, and lift this film somewhat. But all in all it feels like a studio gave the Die Hard director many millions and told him to go to BC and shoot a film that looks like it's supposed to be in Northern Europe...but is obviously in BC. And oh yeah, throw in every cliche you can to pull in all the fans of those genres.

It was hard to feel in any of this film the magic x-factor that distinguishes a great or even very good movie, where every actor and every shot feels focused on moving the story towards its inevitable and thrilling climax (LOTR, Star Wars, etc etc). 13th Warrior felt instead like another over-budgeted and under-scripted Hollyweird film that was shot too long and ends up eviscerated by an editor who was just doing his job: cut this bird down to size before we all fall asleep watching Antonio's make-up shining in the midst of yet another battle.

It is directed by John McTiernan, director of Die Hard, and an uncredited Crichton, and starring Antonio Banderas as Ahmad ibn Fadlan and Vladimir Kulich as Buliwyf (Beowulf). The 13th Warrior was a disappointment at the box office, earning only US$61,698,899 worldwide.

The novel upon which the film is based and loosely inspired by Richard Frye's translation of ibn Fadlan's non-fictional account of his travels up the river Volga in the tenth century. The plot is largely a modernized retelling of the Anglo-Saxon epic Beowulf, with elements added from The Book of One Thousand and One Nights and Seven Samurai.

Although the film was generally panned by critics, some praised it for use of an Arab as its hero.

But ,if you are looking for something to watch in one of those evenings when nothing good is happening on the T.V, then, this is the movie you have been looking for.",1208995200,,1121,4.5
1070869,5,6305692688,"Several weeks ago, I reviewed the recently released, epic disaster Beowulf.  At that time I indicated that---among many other things the movie prompted me to do---one was to watch The 13th Warrior yet again to ""wash my mind out and refocus on a really well done telling of the Beowulf legend.""  Well, just this evening I watched it yet again.  I will NEVER tire of watching this film.  Every time I watch it, something new/never-before-seen catches my eye in terms of how the story is (re)told.  It is one of the richest films I have seen in many years: from the sheer glory of the story told to its relation to historical fact to the use of scene to create and then emphasize those details which weld the story to your heart to the adaptation of/to foreign language learning to the story-telling (diegetic) qualities of the music.  The film is rife with features that appeal to all audiences.  I have not met anyone who did not love the film.

While an adventure story par excellence, the film is consistent with creator Crichton's other works in that it provides a realistic interpretation of what has become myth and legend.  There are no monsters other than the apparently monstrous men seeking to defend what they see as their own way of life on which others are encroaching and adversely affecting; there are no superheroes other than the men and women willing to stand against what they believe to be ravenous oppressors.  And it is around this universal theme that a wonderfully ""illustrated"" story is told from the perspective of a lone Arab poet-ambassador-become-unwilling-warrior.  This is not beyond the realm of possibility: Gwyn Jones---in his work, A History of the Vikings---documents the extensive interaction between the Norsemen and the Arab cultures around the rivers and seas of Inner Asia.

It pays to be attentive to all of the film-story elements: facial expressions, dialogue, action sequences.  There are many that repeat themselves in different contexts, relying on the earlier moments to give the later ones a higher level of meaning and credence.  Consider just two: (1) the ""only an Arab would bring a dog to war"" motif which resurfaces several times over as (a) the now understood derisive remark, (b) the ""jumping dog"" moment which overcomes the derision of the earlier ""joke,"" (c) the Arab on his ""jumping dog"" leaving the stockade to rescue a child when no-one else will move, (d) the real dog which is attached to the Beowulf character; and (2) the ability to draw words and stories which (a) can later be redrawn and recited back, (a) that can make a poor warrior ""wealthy,"" and (b) which can grant immortality---which highlights the subtle implication that the Arab character, who happens also to be a poet, might well have been the author of what we today know as Beowulf.

While the film is not ""perfect, the only serious flaw, in my mind, is the computer animated sequence of the Norse ship at sea.  But for that, I find the movie wholly believable, not requiring a substantial ""willing suspension of disbelief.""",1207958400,4,3053,4.853564547206166

1070944,5,6305692688,"The 13th Warrior is definitely the best Vikings vs. Cannibals movie. If that makes it sound like a down market schlocker, it's anything but, offering instead an imaginative account of what the real inspiration for the epic Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf just might have been. Retitled (it was originally called Eaters of the Dead), re-edited, shelved and partially reshot by Michael Crichton, who replaced Graeme Revell's evocative world music score with an excellent old-fashioned adventure one by Jerry Goldsmith (part of which was used on Kingdom of Heaven's ""Rise a knight"" sequence), even in its final compromised state, it's a terrific adventure movie. It certainly boasts one of the best action scenes of recent years, with a fiery night-battle between the aforementioned Vikings and hundreds of bearskin-clad riders. On the minus side, this setpiece is so very good that the others fail to live up to it, especially the slow-motion final battle. Antonio Banderas is fine as the bewildered Arab ambassador drafted into helping a group of Vikings defeat an evil that cannot be named and Dennis Storhi immensely likeable as his translator/guide into the ways of the Northmen. Great fun, and a far from guilty pleasure.

Unlike other releases, this French DVD includes a featurette, trailer and teaser trailer for McTiernan's original cut when it was still called Eaters of the Dead, though the 2.35:1 transfer is not quite as good as the UK release.",1197763200,2,1448,5.1617021276595745

1070947,4,6305692688,"""The Thirteenth Warrior stars Antonio Banderas as an Arab nobleman.  Ahmed is living the life of dilettante and scholar in Baghdad.  An illicit affair with the wife of another man gets him a diplomatic assignment as far away from Baghdad as possible.  He becomes the Caliphs Ambassador to the North men.

Once he makes contact with his 'charges', events proceed rapidly.  An emissary arrives from another king requesting aid.  Buliwyf (a perfectly cast Vladimir Kulich)agrees to give his assistance.  But before they start their mission, they are told by a soothsayer that the thirteenth warrior must not be a Norseman.  Ahmeds translator is too old.  You've got one guess who gets drafted.

These aren't the kind of guys who take ""No for an answer.  These are hard men.  If they have a problem with someone, they fight.  They talk loud, laugh loud, eat with gusto and drink themselves unconscious.  They live life in the moment and don't seem to have a care in the world.

Obviously our effete ambassador is an odd and very reluctant addition to this crew.  But the bones never lie.  If the old lady says they had to take him, he was going.

His feelings to the contrary aren't relevant.... :-)

Anyway, they are summoned to fight an ancient evil that has besieged a remote Norse settlement.  Of course, the ancient evil is more evil than any they have experienced.  Of course we know with cunning, luck, sheer guts and a strong sword arm our heroes triumph.

That's not what this movie is about.  It's all about the journey and the change our hero goes through as a result.  By the movies end of he has traveled with men, worked in their company and fought in their company.  He started out as a wimpy stranger and grew to be a welcome, respected comrade-in-arms.

In the end he is still a scholar and a poet but he is also a warrior.  As such a worthy servant of Allah.

The movie is based on the Michael Crichton novel, Eaters of the Dead.  Like much of Mr. Crichtons work, it is better as a movie than a book.

1070948,3,6305692688,"I watched this movie because I wanted to see a fantasy story. To me fantasy means something that does not exist or has not been proven to exist in our world. I'm not sure that this movie qualifies at all. Its only claim to the genre is that it is yet another adaptation of the ancient story of Beowulf and Grendel. Some villages are under attack from a mysterious race of creatures called the Wendol, which seem to be half-human, half-bear. They quickly turn out to be just a tribe of cannibalistic cave-dwelling savages who wear bear skins to terrify and confuse their victims.

The movie stars Antonio Banderas as Ahmad ibn Fadlan, an Arab who was exiled from his homeland and meets up with a group of vikings lead by Buliwyf. Then they spend the rest of the movie fighting the Wendol, one battle after another. Some of them die, some of them survive but I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them. Ahmad ibn Fadlan was a real person who lived in the 10th century AD. This doesn't make the story any more interesting and just further dilutes fantasy aspect.

The action sequences and 'battle scenes' are down-to-the-earth raw (no CGI magic!), intelligently done, and immensely enjoyable.

I liked the ""learning to speak the same language""  and prayer sequence as well. These scenes are clever and very well done as examples. Tightly put together.

Except there are not that many movies with that theme. Based on Crichton's short novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" (Crichton reportedly had a hand in the direction of the movie), this is an old-fashioned adventure movie. Crichton made the book as a blend from the real chronicles of an Arab traveler in the land of the Norsemen with the well-known story of Beowulf. The movie blends these two sources greatly and you are likely to go through a good time watching this DVD (if you can't stomach violence, though, you might be better off skipping it).

1071044,4,6305692688,"I first saw this film in the theatres when it was first released, and I remember being disappointed at the time, as I did not particularly care for it. It was shown on television cable channel last night, and I thought, why not give it a second go around. Well, I am certainly glad that I did, as I enjoyed the film much more the second time around and can affirmatively say that I like it.

While the film is apparently based upon Michael Crichton's book, ""Eaters of the Dead"", having not, as yet, read this book, I had no pre-conceived notions about the storyline and have no idea whether or not it is or is not a faithful adaptation. All I can say is that I found it to be an enjoyable, though unusual, action film. Moreover, I do love Antonio Banderas, and I thought that he was particularly dreamy in the role of Ahmad Ibin Fahdlan, a young and exceedingly handsome, well-educated Arab, a poet made an ambassador and exiled from his homeland for having coveted another man's wife.

Ahmed, accompanied by a wily older man, Melchisidek (Omar Sharif), and a band of Arabs, comes across a ragtag group of Norsemen on a ship. With Melchisidek translating for him, Ahmed befriends them when they briefly come ashore, and while with them, the Norsemen get a bit of bad news from home by way of a messenger. It seems that an ancient enemy whose name they cannot even speak aloud, (the Wendols), are savaging their countrymen, and the Norsemen need to get back in a hurry to help. An oracle is consulted, and it seems that thirteen warriors must go back in order to fight successfully this flesh eating enemy. The thirteenth warrior, however, must not be a Norseman. Thus, Ahmed is reluctantly conscripted to fight this ancient evil.

Ahmed goes with them on their ship, heading North, and quickly learning their language. He ends up bonding with the friendly Norseman, Herger the Joyous (Dennis Storhoi). When they arrive at their destination, they see the ravages left by the Wendols and prepare for war against these beast-like beings that they believe to be supernatural in origin, due to the sheer savagery of their methods. There is a reason why they are referred to as eaters of the dead. Ahmed, initially fearful, eventually goes from being squeamish and a quivering bowl of jello in the face of attack to being a stalwart and courageous warrior. This transformation occurs when he discovers that the enemy is not a demon from the dark side but, rather, just a man, though not quite like him.

Antonio Banderas gives a wonderful performance as the sensitive Ahmed, infusing the role with both subtlety and strength. Omar Sharif makes the most of his very brief screen appearance. Dennis Storhoi is terrific in the role of Ahmed's charismatic Norse friend, the intrepid, seasoned warrior, Herger the Joyous. Asides from being an action film, it is also a sort of buddy movie, as well. The Wendols are appropriately fearsome, and some of the cinematography is breathtaking. While some of the sub-plots are not fully fleshed out and a little puzzling, this does not unduly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. Of course, the viewer would do well to suspend disbelief over Ahmed's seeming overnight learning of the Norsemen's language, as well as over the concept of cavemen riding on horseback. Still, notwithstanding some of these little bumps in the road, this is a film that those who like the action genre will enjoy.",1164844800,,3433,4.745393634840871
1071045,4,6305692688,"This film is based on Crichton's book, ""Eaters of the Dead"", an interpretation of the Beowulf Saga.
The story is from the viewpoint of Ibn Fadlan, (based on an actual historical person who represented Arab trade contracts with the Vikings in Russia). In this story, Fadlan is a disgraced court-poet from the Caliphate of Baghdad, sentenced to be a trade-ambassador to the Norsemen, as mentioned. He winds up being ""recruited"" without his consent into a special mission of Vikings to rescue a small Nordic kingdom far to the north. This kingdom is being overrun by a savage and primitive tribe of canibalistic barbarians. Although he is not a warrior, and has serious doubts about his survival, Fadlan bravely faces danger with the Vikings, and learns to fight. Being an educated man, he utilizes his knowledge and intuition as a great asset to the group, earning the respect of the Norsemen.
This is an action movie, not a serious historical film, of course. I was impressed when I saw it in the theater. There are some minor ""Hollywoodisms"" as usual, that were a bit irritating to a sense for historical accuracy: One of the Vikings uses a Roman gladiator helmet...where the hell would he get that in the early Middle-ages? Many of the polearms used by the warriors are of a type belonging to a much later era of Middle-ages. Vikings used basic thrusting or throwing spears, and a little-known long-arm nick-named ""mail-scraper"".
However, in the name of historical accuracy, the Vikings in this movie are wearing Byzantine armor, and this is believable, as many Norsemen in Russia were often veterans of service in the elite Varangian Guard of the Byzantine empire.

1071048,4,6305692688,"This story is loosely and I mean loosely based on the epic poem Beowulf. An Arab falls for the wrong woman so her husband has him sent far away as an ambasador. He meets up with a bunch of Vikings who are needed to go help fell Northmen from supernatural beasts who have been terrorizing them. It turns out that 13 men are needed and 1 of them can't be a Northman so the Arab must go. So they all go and defend the village.

One thing I like was how everything wasn't made all fancy looking like a lot of fantasy films try to do with their films. Everything looks like it would have looked like for it's time period, like the weapons, armour, clothes, homes and the wooden castle. Although some of the weapons and armour actually weren't used by real Vikings. The scenery is also good with it's green fields and forests and all of that fog. The fighting scenes were also pretty good and there's quite a bit of them too. One interesting thing is how they show the differnces from the Vikings and Muslim culture like how the Arab thinks that the Viking way of life is very dirty and barbaric. The Viking leader also shows interest in the Arab being able to write and he himself tries to write something in Arabic that the Arab had showed him.

Some things I didn't like was the ending because it seemed very anti-climatic because the leader of the bad guys dies way too early in the last battle and after that the rest of the bad guys run away into the mist. Also they should have shown a grand funeral for the Viking leader at the end. Also some of the characters really don't have that much depth so you really don't care when they start to die.

I also felt a couple of things were just a little too farfetched like when the Arab picks up Norse by just listening to them for a while. You can't just learn an entire language by just listening to it for a few days or weeks or for however long it took him to learn it but if he didn't then there probaly would have been subtitles because in the beggining the vikings are speaking Norse and after the Arab learns it they start to speak english.  Another thing that's farfetched is that the bad guys turn out to be Neanderthals, who were by this point in time extinct but in the end it works out so it doesn't really matter.

Overall there really aren't too many Viking movies out there and out of the very very few that I have seen I would say that this is the best one. So if you want to see a good Viking or fantasy type movie then you need to get this movie.",1160006400,4,2509,4.186335403726708

It has an authentic feel, despite the choppy editing and Banderas' strange acting. The actors (especially Kulich) look like real people and real Vikings, not Hollywood pretty boys with pasted-on beards. The setting is realistically grim, savage and foreboding.

And it's not often we get to see a film set in the Viking Age, which makes such movies a real treat for those of us who love pictures about that time in history.  To top it off, a first rate cast was hired, and they all turn in great performances.  So this should have been a fantastic movie.  As it is, it's only decent.  What could have been epic, is now merely entertaining.  As many other reviewers have noted, the most severe problem is that the film was chopped to bits in the editing room, and the result is a very jumpy, uneven pace.  I understand the need to keep movies down to a reasonable length of time, but this movie could have benefitted from a little extra length to flesh out some of the scenes, develop the characters, and even out the pacing of the story.

Another gripe I have is that they should have hired a more knowledgeable historical/archaeological consultant to get the period look of the film right.  A lot of people in the audience might not spot the anachronistic elements, but those familiar with the Viking Age cannot help but shake their heads to see the Viking warriors wielding swords that look like crude, barely sharpened iron bars, more primitive looking than anything seen in Europe at that time, or indeed for over thousand years earlier; not to mention one Viking wearing a solid breastplate of a type not used in Europe until centuries later, while another wears Roman gladiator's helmet(!) from several hundred years ealier.  Couldn't they have spared a little money from the budget to hire a historian who could have helped them get such details right?

It seems that an ancient enemy whose name they cannot even speak aloud, (the Wendols), are savaging their countrymen, and the Norsemen need to get back in a hurry to help. An oracle is consulted, and it seems that thirteen warriors must go back in order to fight successfully this flesh eating enemy. The thirteenth warrior, however, must not be a Norseman. Thus, Ahmed is reluctantly conscripted to fight this ancient evil.

Ahmed goes with them on their ship, heading North, and quickly learning their language. He ends up bonding with the friendly Norseman, Herger the Joyous (Dennis Storhoi). When they arrive at their destination, they see the ravages left by the Wendols and prepare for war against these beast-like beings that they believe to be supernatural in origin, due to the sheer savagery of their methods. There is a reason why they are referred to as eaters of the dead. Ahmed, initially fearful, eventually goes from being squeamish and a quivering bowl of jello in the face of attack to being a stalwart and courageous warrior. This transformation occurs when he discovers that the enemy is not a demon from the dark side but, rather, just a man, though not quite like him.

Antonio Banderas gives a wonderful performance as the sensitive Ahmed, infusing the role with both subtlety and strength. Omar Sharif makes the most of his very brief screen appearance. Dennis Storhoi is terrific in the role of Ahmed's charismatic Norse friend, the intrepid, seasoned warrior, Herger the Joyous. Asides from being an action film, it is also a sort of buddy movie, as well. The Wendols are appropriately fearsome, and some of the cinematography is breathtaking. While some of the sub-plots are not fully fleshed out and a little puzzling, this does not unduly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. Of course, the viewer would do well to suspend disbelief over Ahmed's seeming overnight learning of the Norsemen's language, as well as over the concept of cavemen riding on horseback. Still, notwithstanding some of these little bumps in the road, this is a film that those who like the action genre will enjoy.",1150588800,2,3433,4.745393634840871
1071102,5,6305692688,"The problem with a film with `13' in the title is that it makes it sound like a horror film; this film is not (this is the same problem with the film ""13th Floor"" which was even advertised as a horror film; it isn't, it's a good science fiction film).  This film is a superbly excellent Viking tale, fast paced and cutting edge.  Some reviewers have even complained that the film is too short at 90 minutes.  That's actually a complement, when you want a film to be longer.  And that's certainly the case here.  The nice flip side to that is that if you like this genre of films, adventure/action/thriller, you will not be bored.  There aren't that many (or any) good modern Viking films.  In the 1950's was a popular film called ""The Vikings"" with some popular actors of the time.  Oh my lord is that film dated.  At one point there's a Viking funeral that just seems to last forever.  Then there was another film called the Anglos and the Norse or something that also seemed to drag on for hours.  So I think Viking films are now saddled with this stigmata of loooong sequences of ruddy, shaggy faced people, singing awfully, sloshing their beer steins, and saying things like `come here you wench', etc, etc.  This film is *not* that.  This is a crisp film.  Sure enough when there are Vikings, there's drinking, but a least it lasts 30 seconds and not 18 hours.  The scenery is utterly stupendous.  It gives a feel of Norway's fjords.  It was actually filmed in British Columbia and I think it could win awards just for cinematography (if it already didn't).

If you like adventure, action, and even thriller films, it's hard to believe you won't be entertained by this film.  The Vikings are an interesting people, and traveled widely.  There's evidence that they traveled to the heart of Rus (Russia).  They would disassemble there ships carry them over to the next river and reassemble them.  The film has cross-cultural portrayal of, all things, a Muslim, making it an interesting film just from that aspect of two somewhat disparate cultures.  And it's tongue-in-check in places as well.  One could be grossed out by the beginning when all the Vikings share the same bowl of water, sloshing it in their mouths and spitting it out, blowing their snot in it, and then passing it to Antonio Banderas, but you're not; because after all, this is just one big happy Viking family.  And if a film can get away with a risky maneuver that can backfire is a sign of crisp and intelligent directing and editing.

This movie is great, I know it was based on a book that I didn't read, but I really liked it.

1071104,5,6305692688,"The 13th Warrior is definitely the best Vikings vs. Cannibals movie. If that makes it sound like a down market schlocker, it's anything but, offering instead an imaginative account of what the real inspiration for the epic Anglo-Saxon poem Beowulf just might have been. Retitled (it was originally called Eaters of the Dead), re-edited, shelved and partially reshot by Michael Crichton, who replaced Graeme Revell's evocative world music score with an excellent old-fashioned adventure one by Jerry Goldsmith (part of which was used on Kingdom of Heaven's ""Rise a knight"" sequence), even in its final compromised state, it's a terrific adventure movie. It certainly boasts one of the best action scenes of recent years, with a fiery night-battle between the aforementioned Vikings and hundreds of bearskin-clad riders. On the minus side, this setpiece is so very good that the others fail to live up to it, especially the slow-motion final battle. Antonio Banderas is fine as the bewildered Arab ambassador drafted into helping a group of Vikings defeat an evil that cannot be named and Dennis Storhi immensely likeable as his translator/guide into the ways of the Northmen. Great fun, and a far from guilty pleasure.

I guess, everyone else will scoff at the idea of 12 Norse warriors teaming up with an Arab messenger to beat back an ancient evil, as too darn fantastic.

But the camaraderie, the hard fighting, the relucatance to surrender, and the sheer strength of will power, as depicted in this movie, is some thing every guy can relate to and appreciate.

It has some wonderful acting, none of that sissy girlie stuff. No flowers and candle lit dinners (NO GUY LIKES THAT STUFF!!), when the warriors like a wench and the wench feels like it, they just go for it. And then wake up in the middle of the night with huge swords and shields and beat the living day lights out of the enemy.

Amazing scenry and depiction of the norse knorrs, and the cold northern reaches they called home. Excellent costumes and depiction of both the Norse warriors and the bear cult they fight. Excellent dialogue exchanges, and a fast paced story line. Adventure, drama and action... loads of action.

A thoroughly enjoyable movie. Get the guys over, grab a few beers and order in some pizzas... and don't forget to send the women out on a silly shopping trip or something.

1071106,4,6305692688,"The first time I watched ""The 13th Warrior"" there came a point where I started rolling my eyes because it was clear that this movie 1999 movie was a combination of the epic story of ""Beowulf,"" Akira Kurosawa's ""Shichinin no samurai,"" and ""The Clan of the Cave Bear.""  But to my surprise this movie has grown on me over the years, despite its flaw.  Adapted by William Wisher, Jr. (""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"") from the novel by Michael Crichton, it is clear early on that the primary sub-text is ""Beowulf,"" since the 1st Warrior is named Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich), leader of a band of Vikings.  Now, if you are familiar with that ancient tale (which may not be a whole heck of a lot of people in modern America), you can figure out which characters represent Grendel and which his maternal unit. But then you notice that we have a band of warriors showing up to defend a place and when the big battle at the end takes place in the rain you know the film is borrowing heavily from ""Shichinin no samurai.""  But then if you are going to borrow heavily from a film, that is certainly a great one to rip off.

The lead character is one we have seen before, although the name is not: Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad (Antonio Banderas). He's puny compared to these Norsemen, not to mention a stranger in a strange land where he can not speak the language (at first), but he's smart and brains can do what brawn can not.  Our hero is forced to become the 13th warrior because some old crone rolls the bones and declares the final member of the party, who represent the number of months in a year under the lunar calendar, cannot be a Norseman.  They do not speak Arabic and he does not speak Norse, but as they travel north together he learns to speak their language by listening.  Nice little trick and even if his Arabian pony is considered a ""dog"" by the company and his scimitar a ""toothpick,"" he proves himself to be worthy, even if he does not understand Viking politics and folk remedies.

The texture of this film comes from the dozen Vikings. You will have a hard time figuring out which Viking is which; even if you turn on the closed captioning they never refer to each other by name. You get to the end credits and you just cannot figure out who was who. The Vikings are played by unknown (and maybe even first time) actors, so it is not a conglomerate of recognizable faces and they are the best part of the film. I think my favorite is Dennis Storh?i as Herger the Joyous, but I am not sure if that is the character I think it is, which would be the one who speaks Latin at the beginning with Omar Sharif and first calls Bandaras' character ""Ibn"" (which means ""son of"") and later ""Little Brother.""  It would be nice if this band of brothers had more recognizable names.

The bad guys in this film are basically a giant horde with the collective intelligence of your vegetable of choice with a tendency to disappear every time they are on the verge of total victory. This is to be expected when you are dealing with what I guess are supposed to be Neanderthals, which is where ""The Clan of the Cave Bear"" enters into the mix). The location photography is spectacular and there are several above average set pieces put together by director John McTiernan (""Die Hard"")  that rely on that standard staple of comedy in action films, namely Viking humor. Consequently, I know think this is a solid ""B"" movie worth at least one bag of popcorn.  I just watched it again tonight and I will probably play the DVD one more time this year.  Like I said, the darn thing has grown on me.",1144627200,2,3600,4.40210843373494
1071107,4,6305692688,"To start with, I should admit to being a Michael Crichton fan, so it's perhaps not surprising that I liked this DVD a lot. It is one of the few movies based on a novel that have struck me as actually adding something to the book. Not to give too much away, it is set in the Dark Ages when Vikings (Northmen) sailed around Europe plundering and pillaging. They even reached Constantinople, and founded Russia on the way through. Banderas is a civilized Muslim Arab from Baghdad (""the world's greatest city"") who finds himself co-opted by twelve Vikings setting off to tackle an unspoken - and unspeakable - menace. After a typical Viking journey by horse and longship, they arrive at Heorot, the hall of King Hrothgar. Yes, it's the Beowulf story (although the hero is actually called Buliwyf). And that means... Grendel, the monster who attacks Heorot by night and drags grown warriors off to his lair to eat them. Well, their heads at least.

The story works on at least two levels. It is simultaneously a fairly gripping action yarn, and a fascinating insight into the way the Northmen lived. Their sharp intelligence and grasp of technology contrasts with their primitive habits, such as lack of cleanliness. And their matter-of-fact acceptance of pain and death are instructive not only to their Arab visitor, but to our present-day selves. Together with their rough and ready humour, this makes them surprisingly likeable.

Finally, of course, there is the underlying mystery of who the ""Wendel"" really are. Men? Beasts? Supernatural monsters? The movie doesn't say - if you want to find out, read the book!",1144108800,3,1612,4.87956204379562
1071158,4,6305692688,"The story of ""The 13th Warrior"" comes from Michael Crichton's novel ""The Eaters of the Dead"" which combines the legend of Beowulf with a historical account of an Arab diplomat who meets and dwells with the Vikings after being banished from his homeland due to an adulterous liaison.

Antonio Banderas stars as the Arab while the hulking Vladimir Kulich heads the Viking cast in the Beowulf role of Buliwyf (pronounced in the film BULL-vie). Speaking of Kulich, he would've made for an excellent Mighty Thor back in the day!

The plot of the film is great: Once Banderas meets up with the Vikings, they run afoul of a tribe of cannibalistic Neanderthals who masquerade as fearsome bears and live in a mysterious cave complex. Banderas is selected as the lone non-Viking to assist the 12 Norsemen in ridding the communities of the threat, hence ""the 13th warrior."" The cast, characters, story, locations (Campbell River, Vancouver Island), sets, costumes, score (Jerry Goldsmith), and cinematography are all of the highest order.

At a little over an hour and a half the film moves along briskly with a lot of action. Make no mistake, ""The 13th Warrior"" is put together extremely well -- this is a Class A film all the way -- but some story elements seem to be underdeveloped. This is probably due to the conflict Michael Crichton had with director John McTiernan. Crichton insisted on reshoots and cut at least 30 minutes of McTiernan's work, reportedly important character-developing scenes.

We see this in the very prologue of the film: The story of Banderas' banishment from his homeland due to his indiscretions is literally relayed in a matter of a couple minutes. And at the 8 minute mark we are introduced to the Vikings with very little mystery and zero suspense build-up. The contrast of the sophisticated Arab culture with the coarse, rugged Norsemen is great, but I would have enjoyed seeing these characters fleshed-out a bit more. After all, the more we know the individuals, the more we care about what ultimately happens to them.

Which brings us to the final 30 minutes of the film involving Banderas and the Vikings infiltrating the cannibal's cave stronghold and a final Neanderthal attack on a Viking village. The visuals of these scenes are awe-inspiring but they fly by so quickly that the viewer is left disoriented and strangely uninvolved, not to mention unmoved by the story's outcome.

All this reveals that ""The 13th Warrior"" COULD have been an outstanding 140-minute Viking epic, along the lines of ""Troy,"" ""Braveheart"" or ""Gladiator;"" instead we are left with a brisk, action-oriented, near-throwaway Viking popcorn flick. I would love to see a Director's Cut some day but Vladimir Kulich opines that it will unfortunately never happen.

Nonetheless, I appreciate the film as is. It's a good Viking adventure flick that's very professionally put together, despite the post-production problems. It's one of those films that gets better with each viewing, probably because everything flies by so quickly on initial plays.

Despite it's flaws, ""The 13th Warrior"" isn't too far from rivaling Kirk Douglas' brilliant 1958 ""The Vikings"" as the greatest Viking film ever made (of course, there aren't many). A Director's Cut could possibly even topple ""The Vikings"" from its lofty, coveted perch. Better than both though is the awesome TV series ""Vikings"" that started in 2013.

The film was shot in British Columbia: Campbell River on Vancouver Island, Williams Lake and Pemberton, British Columbia.

1071159,4,6305692688,"The book of course is better but this movie does a very good job of telling the story and making you feel like being in medieval Scandanavia.

The initial clash and consequent friendship between an Arab Prince from Baghdad who is exiled for 'eying' the forbidden fruit of another man's wife and his 12 Northman (viking) companions who must face an phantom threat in scandanavia (advanced, cavalry riding neanderthals) is both fantastic and believable thanks to Criton's excellent research.

One part of the movie when the Vikings are astonished to see the Arab prince ""draw sounds"" (write) and then read the back (read) is both historically accurate and dramatically effective.

The only down side to the movie is that Antonio Banderas with his thick ass Castillian Spanish accent is completly Unconvincing as an Arab Prince. He certainly looks the part but he brings the movie down a little bit. Omar Sharif's small part in the begining of the movie is a gem, which is sort of a double edged sword since it exposes Bandera's inferior acting and clout.

With that said, I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoyed other epics such as Gladiator, Braveheart, Kingdom of Heaven or any other Historical adventure movies.",1143072000,,1217,4.950980392156863
1071160,5,6305692688,"'The 13th Warrior', or 'Eaters of the Dead' which is the original title, is loosely based on Beowulf.  In fact Michael Crichton, the author, openly discusses Beowulf as his inspiration for the book. The interesting twist, however, is that a real diary written by an arab named Ibn Fadlan who traveled to Russia in 921 a.d. where he met some vikings on his journey, and in his written accounts he discusses his encounters with what he considered to be savages. Michael Crichton uses this account, as well as many other historical references, to recreate an exciting and more adventurous, romantic tale, that is more engaging and obviously more modern than the original epic. What Crichton did was an attempt at breathing new life into a classic, much like many of the modern remakes of Shakespeare plays.

I thought the movie was pretty good, and entertaining on many levels, even though it was underdeveloped in terms of many of the plot twists, such as the romance between Antonio Banderas and the Nordic woman he grew affectionate towards. This would have added a whole different dimension to the film and would have made it slightly better as a result.

Being Norwegian, I recognized the Norwegian language in the film, which was a good attempt to make it more realistic, but Icelandic is closer to Old Norse/the real viking language than Norwegian, which is more of a mix of Danish, Swedish and Old Norse.  I am glad that they used it though because most films never even bother to try to stay true to the source of the tale.

The characters were very interesting and seemed authentic in their portrayals, which was a major plus.  Character development was quite impressive, especially that of Ahmed Hamad, who learned a great deal from his Nordic friends, which I got the impression was mutual for them as well.  There was a real sense of comradery between them, which really made the movie more emotional and entertaining.  These guys would die for each other, and they saw past their cultural differences, growing as human beings in the process, which was profound.

The battles were very impressive albeit graphic and brutal.  Watching the movie I got the sense that I was a witness to a clash of titans, warriors full of fury, guts as well as skill.

I really liked the setting of the film which added to the escapism factor.  The producers did a great job on creating authentic viking homes and weapons, not to mention the costumes.

Perhaps most importantly in a film such as this were the villains, who were excellent as these cannibalistic, blood thirsty, unrelenting savages that would put the fear of god into any mortal.

I really enjoyed this film and I highly recommend it for anyone who loves films from this period as well as fans of war movies.  Exciting from beginning to end, its thrills are virtually non-stop.",1142640000,,2834,4.778688524590164

While Crichton gleefully borrows from the Anglo Saxon Beowulf, his ""historian"" is a fabrication.

The fictional author's name, in latin, means ""false"" and ""forgery"".

Be that as it may, it's a great, fun, rollicking ride. The juxtaposition between an Arab gentleman and the far earthier and garrulous Norsemen is wonderfully presented. There is as much humor as violence in this movie that certainly has its heroic moments, but which also features a scenario of cultural interchange that privleges adaptation and understanding . . . . a representation certainly worth viewing and 'reviewing' in these troubled times when all things middle eastern are seen as uncivilized if not downright ""barbaric"".",1141516800,2,1006,5.367088607594937

I have been fascinated by the norse culture for years,and YES, I actually read Eaters of the Dead, too.

It is an excelent action flick, which is what is was market as (quite successfully), with plenty of tough guys and sword fights and epic battles. But, while i very much enjoyed these aspects of the film it was something else that made me want to add it to my collection.

The story revolves around an Arab man of high society (played by Antonio Banderas, I was wary of this choice, but he did an excelent job...though his accent did grate at me a bit) who is thrown, almost litteraly, out of the world he has always known and into events that he scarcely understands with 'Northmen'(read Norse) companions that he considers, at first, to be the very antitheses of civilized company. They in turn look on him as a runtish whelp that can only be a hinderance and a butt of jibing remarks that he does not understand.

As the story progresses however, each side of this equation comes to respect the other and thier abilities. and a strong bond is formed both from this growing respect and the brotherhood born of shared battles. The jibes of the Northmen continue to be directed at the Arab but with a light-heartedness of laughing with instead of laughing at, and the Arab in turn begins to appreciate and even adopt some of the strange customs of the 'barbarians'.

It becomes, in my eyes a story of self discovery, that culminates just before the final battle, when the Arab first prays to Allah with a traditinal prayer, then joins in the funeral prayer of the northmen. It is one of the most powerfull moments on film i have seen, and Banderas (all arguements of of his casting choice aside) did a truely amazing job with the scene.

The other reason I simply had to have this movie, was that it is the first I have ever come across that does not treat the Norse civilization as a bunch of muscleheaded battle crazed brutes. It also does not shy away from the educational short coming of the Norse either. There are a series of scenes were the leader of the Northman group ask the arab about ""Drawing Sounds"" (writing), a thing that the norse mystic guarded as a sacred secret tool. but in other matters it shows a great depth of thought and perception, such as the way they set thier guards, to their use of natural medicines (yes the cow urine thing really does work, and was used back then), and particularly a scene that deals with political maneuvering that would make Machiavelli proud.

All together this movie is full of refreshing new perspectives on culture, the nature of faith, and self discovery. And best of all it does all this with out ever once sacrificing on action, plot, the fast pace of the film. That in itself is an accomplishment that makes it worthy of addition in one's collection.",1139875200,3,2773,4.547094188376754
1071166,5,6305692688,"I am still waiting for a Director's Cut on this film.  It's one of my all time favorites, the best ""Sword"" movie ever, in my humble opinion, far superior to 'Braveheart'.  No shining knights here, just brave and tough northmen (Vikings!) who do not hesitate to stand up to their worst fears and face them.  Based on the Michael Crichton novel 'Eaters Of The Dead', 'The 13th Warrior' holds up to the standards of the book but could have been a bolder, better, more sweeping epic if the makers of the film had just put a little more effort into it.

Basically, Arab Ahmed (Antonio Banderas) is forced from his country to be an ambassador to the wild northlands.  As he visits at the funeral of a Viking king with his friend Melchisidek (Omar Shariff), the northmen are summoned by a boy to aid their brethren in a fight against an unnamable evil.  The Oracle calls for thirteen men, and the thirteenth must not be a northman.  Ahmed is chosen for the journey, though he cannot even speak their language.

He learns their language on the way, surprising the Vikings, but befriending Herger (Dennis Storhoi).  To Ahmed, the Northmen are barbarians with unclean and brutal ways, but as he lives among them, he discovers their heart, courage, and camaraderie, and beyond that the intelligence behind their cruelty.

The Northmen, along with Ahmed, take on the infamous Wendol, the Eaters Of The Dead, elusive and cunning humans who have a relationship with bears and with the earth.  An old woman informs King Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich) that he must remove the root and kill the war leader.

The fight scenes in this movie are spectacular, the scenery stunning, and the acting superior.  Vladimir Kulich, Dennis Storhoi, and Omar Shariff steal the show, so even if you are leery of a Banderas film, don't sweat it.  This was a different role for Banderas that he played extremely well, but was still out-shown by the excellent performances of Kulich and Storhoi.  Honorable mentions to Daniel Southern, Neil Maffin, John DeSantis, Clive Russel, Mischa Hausserman, Ablie Woodington, and Richard Bremmer as the brutal Viking warriors who take on the Wendol.

From the bleak shorelines to the misty hills, from the wooden Greathouse to the muddy fields, this movie has 'Brute Warrior' written all over it, and the stoic, heroic Buliwyf will show you what a real man is made of.  Swords, competition, empires, real warriors, mud, blood, fear, superstition, and a bit of magic will keep your eyes glued to the candy on the screen.

Definitely a ""buy"".  If they come out with a Director's Cut, I will buy it twice, it's that good.  Enjoy!",1136764800,13,2626,4.793333333333333

1071201,4,6305692688,"I found The 13th Warrior to be a highly satisfying experience in retelling the story of ""Beowulf.""
I have always been fascinated by the fact that Vikings had travelled all the way to Constantinople/Istanbul well before 800 A.D.  That the Byzantine Emperor's Varangian guard was composed entirely of Norsemen.  That great cultures --- such as the Middle Eastern Muslims and European Christians --- managed to rub elbows and coexist (more or less) harmoniously for centuries.  (This is something that Islamists want us to forget.)
In ""The 13th Warrior,"" an Islamic Arabian diplomat joins a band of Viking warriors as they travel to northern Europe to aid a king.  The king is plagued by flesh-eaters, and thus the story of the Anglo-Saxon epic, ""Beowulf,"" is retold through the sensibility of the Arab narrator.
Is the armour utterly authentic to this period?  Nope!  Fifteenth-century plate armour sticks out like the proverbial sore thumb. *But*... does this film capture the character of Norse and Anglo-Saxon warriors?  Yes, plus it captures the feral qualities of some of the tribes who fought with the Norsemen. (I kept thinking of ancient Celts, who collected severed heads, as I saw the flesh-eaters of this film.)

We have a Crichton story and McTiernan directing, two very promising ingredients indeed, and they both deliver on their promise. There are various criticisms of the movie to be seen in some of these reviews and some of them are spot on. Yes, too much was edited out of this movie, far too much sadly, and yes the DVD included no deleted scenes or anything extra except for the cheesy trailer. BUT......c'mon, the musical score is superb, the scenery absolutely breath-taking, the bad guys are interesting, fantastical, and scary, the Viking heroes are complex, interesting, very heroic and culturally accurate (an almost mind-blowing feat for Hollywood), the acting is extraordinarily goood (where the heck did they get the guys who played the Vikings? They're perfectly cast and great actors to boot), the story is exciting, and there is a goose-bump inducing funeral chant I could listen to about 7,000 times and still shiver every time I hear it. Altogether, WOW!!!!!  Yes, I pray that there is a director's cut some day because I would like another hour of character development but what was left of this movie after some savage and unwarranted editing, is still enough to make my all-time favortite, top-ten list of movies and of those on the list I watch this one as regularly as any.

1071245,5,6305692688,"`The Thirteenth Warrior', based on a book originally entitled `Eaters of the Dead' by Michael Crighton seems to have gotten a reputation as a very weak movie, certainly not in the same league as `Jurassic Park' or `The Andromeda Strain'. I am writing this review to suggest that this movie is better than the book and eminently rewatchable, an important aspect of whether or not you want to buy a movie on DVD.

It is better than the book in that the book is written in the form of a journal by the principle character, an Arab who is serving as an ambassador from the Caliph in Baghdad to some distant northern country bordering the distant marches of the Islamic empire sometime around the twelfth or thirteenth century. The movie is still done from the Arab's point of view, but not to the exclusion of other characters' thoughts.

One sure way to evaluate any work is to compare it to other similar works. In this case, the closest match is the classic western `The Magnificent Seven'. In both movies, a group of elite fighters are summoned to a village to protect it against some menace. As each movie develops, there are interactions between the warriors and the townsfolk, mostly unfortunate and a brake against the fighters' achieving their principle objective.

There are certainly a lot of differences. In `The Magnificent Seven', the primary subplot is in the closing of the western wilderness and the disappearance of opportunities for hired gunfighters. In `The Thirteenth Warrior', the most important theme is the nature of the threat to the village. It is not even clear whether the opponent is human, animal, or phantasm. A theme running through the story is the contrast between the culture of the Northmen and the single Arab, the thirteenth warrior, played so well by Antonio Banderas.

While the most important character in `The Magnificent Seven', played by Yul Brynner, is the leader of the group of hired gunmen, the most important character in `The Thirteenth Warrior' is comparable to the role of Horst Bucholtz, the amateur outsider. But even while the leading Northmen have relatively small roles, their appearance and business is so well designed that you have no difficulty telling them apart, even though they are all played by relatively unknown actors.

An interesting contrast to the quality of these two movies is `The Last Valley', a Michael Caine / Omar Sharif vehicle which follows a similar plot line in that a band of soldiers finds their way, uninvited, to a hidden village, untouched by the turmoil of the 30 Years War. While there are many parallels, it is instructive to see how two of these movies work and the third does not, in that you simply have no concern for the fate of the characters.

While many things do not work in `The Last Valley', everything seems to work to good effect in `The Thirteenth Warrior'. A fine example of this is in the scene depicting the friction between the visiting warriors and the locals when the Northman in a role comparable to Steve McQueen's part in `...Seven' must take out a follower of the local prince in a way which demonstrates that the visiting troops are not to be fooled with.

The central energy driving the plot in `The Thirteenth Warrior' is the mystery of the nature of the `Eaters of the Dead' and how to defeat them. This plot element bears a strong similarity to the problem posed to Schwarzenegger and his crew in `Predator' and the steps along the way are almost as satisfying as when Arnold goes one on one with the alien hunter. This also happens to be similar to Creighton's plot in `Congo'. And, I for one happen to think the device works a lot better in `The Thirteenth Warrior'. It is much more plausible that a small group of 12th century Northmen can have a tough time with a very shadowy, strong enemy than it is to believe that a well armed 20th century mercenaries would have trouble with a bunch of gorillas. The proof of the pudding is that when a similar group of soldiers are faced with an invisible, heavily armed alien, the story becomes much more interesting.

Since I first saw `The Thirteenth Warrior', I have seen it at least three more times and I am as interested in watching it again as I am in the prospect of watching `The Magnificent Seven' again.",1112745600,5,4275,4.705882352941177
1071246,4,6305692688,"I don't know why this film didn't do well at the box office and was pretty well savaged by most critics (the notable exception being ""Entertainment Weekly"", which gave it a great review), but its an underrated gem.  On the surface, its a rather obvious rehash of every film that features a small group of men going against overwhelming odds to prove their courage (""Magnificent Seven"", anyone?), but there is so much more to the film.

From its impressive cinematography to its solid performances, intriguing plot, well-orchestrated action sequences and driving score by the great Jerry Goldsmith, its still essentially a comic book fantasy, but an expertly executed one.  If this is shlock, then Hollywood should make more films like this.

Some other highlights:  Antonio Banderas is very likeable here and he excels in his performance, providing a nice mix of machismo with light comedy as he did to near-perfection in films such as ""The Mask of Zorro.""  His effete performance plays well against the hulking Nordic characters who look like they stepped right out of Kirk Douglass's ""The Vikings"" (not necessarily a bad thing.)

The plot's mix of mystical fantasy with brutal, realistic violence might put some off, but the more violent moments are mostly filmed at night, in dark shadows.  There are also lots of beautiful backgrounds in the film as well.  Another nice touch is the pseudo-supernatural elements of the film which are introduced subtley and effectively.

And then there's the great score by Goldsmith, a thundering, primordial opera that fits the film perfectly.

Give this movie a try.  You might be surprised at how entertaining it is.",1112227200,3,1657,5.07380073800738

1071248,3,6305692688,"I happened to turn on the televison and see the beginning of this film. I have not read Michael Crichton's novel, nor had I even heard of this movie. I had, however, heard of the book of Ibn Khaldun, a medieval Arab poet and historian. A man of learning and curiosity, he travelled throughout the known world of his time, and even beyond. He wrote a vivid narrative of his journey out of the orderly Islamic world into the wild darkness of the far north. Way up near the location of modern Kiev, he met some of the Swedish vikings who ruled the inland waterways of Eastern Europe, setting up trading posts and founding some of the major cities in the region. Imagine my surprise at seeing a vivid enactment of one of the most famous scenes from Ibn Khaldun's book taking place in an obscure movie on the Sci-Fi channel. The Viking funeral, the human sacrifice of a young girl to accompany her master to the next world,  and the opening scenes in the king's hall were very close to the original description, although some of the more brutal details were left out. Although this film is a work of fiction, it contains many authentic details of ancient life that can be even stranger than anything invented by a modern novelist.

I thought the movie was visually convincing, and free of obvious anachronisms in costumes and weaponry. The story was simple enough, but gave a good sense of the fear and wonder the traveler must have felt upon encountering people whose world was so strange it might as well have been another planet.  I hope that seeing this film will encourage more people to take a journey into the strange and wonderful world of Medieval travel narratives.",1110844800,4,1670,4.597315436241611

The cast is quite good and with multiple viewings they will make you appreciate them. Antonio Banderas turns in a wonderful performance as the 13th warrior. As an Arab he seems out of place with a group of Vikings in search of a group of raiders that are destroying their villages. At first he thinks they are gross braggards that he can barely tolerate to associate. In time he begins to appreciate them for the warriors and men they truly are. The sets are dark and well done. The music is magnificent and blends with the action perfectly. Fans of movies like ""The Seven Samurai"" or ""Conan the Barbarian"" should enjoy it. My hat is off to the directors McTiernan and Crichton for bringing out the right traits in the characters and keeping the action at a good pace. This was not a box office hit but seems to be gaining appreciation with multiple appearances on TV. I for one plan to pick up the DVD since I have seen it three times on TV and I realize it has great replayability.",1110844800,3,1133,4.4
1071281,4,6305692688,"I first saw this film in the theatres when it was first released, and I remember being disappointed at the time, as I did not particularly care for it. It was shown on television cable channel last night, and I thought, why not give it a second go around. Well, I am certainly glad that I did, as I  enjoyed the film much more the second time around and can affirmatively say that I like it.

While the film is apparently based upon Michael Crichton's book, ""Eaters of the Dead"", having not, as yet, read this book, I had no pre-conceived notions about the storyline and have no idea whether or not it is or is not a faithful adaptation. All I can say is that I found it to be an enjoyable, though unusual,  action film. Moreover, I do love Antonio Banderas, and I thought that he was particularly dreamy in the role of Ahmad Ibin Fahdlan, a young and exceedingly handsome, well-educated Arab, a poet made an ambassador and exiled from his homeland for having coveted another man's wife.

Ahmed, accompanied by a wily older man, Melchisidek (Omar Sharif), and a band of Arabs, comes across a ragtag group of Norsemen on a ship. With Melchisidek translating for him, Ahmed befriends them when they briefly come ashore, and while with them, the Norsemen get a bit of bad news from home by way of a messenger. It seems that an ancient enemy whose name they cannot even speak aloud, (the  Wendols), are savaging their countrymen, and the Norsemen need to get back in a hurry to help. An oracle is consulted, and it seems that thirteen warriors must go back in order to fight successfully this flesh eating enemy. The thirteenth warrior, however,  must not be a Norseman. Thus, Ahmed is reluctantly conscripted to fight this ancient evil.

Ahmed goes with them on their ship, heading North, and quickly learning their language. He ends up bonding with the friendly Norseman, Herger the Joyous (Dennis Storhoi). When they arrive at their destination, they see the ravages left by the Wendols and prepare for war against these beast-like beings that they believe to be supernatural in origin, due to the sheer savagery of their methods. There is a reason why they are referred to as eaters of the dead. Ahmed, initially fearful,  eventually goes from being squeamish and a quivering bowl of jello in the face of attack to being a stalwart and courageous warrior. This transformation occurs when he discovers that the enemy is not a demon from the dark side but, rather, just a man, though not quite like him.

Antonio Banderas gives a wonderful performance as the sensitive Ahmed, infusing the role with both subtlety and strength. Omar Sharif makes the most of his very brief screen appearance.  Dennis Storhoi is terrific in the role of Ahmed's charismatic Norse friend, the intrepid, seasoned  warrior,  Herger the Joyous. Asides from being an action film, it is also a sort of buddy movie, as well. The Wendols are appropriately fearsome, and some of the cinematography is breathtaking. While some of the sub-plots are not fully fleshed out and a little puzzling, this does not unduly detract from the overall enjoyment of the film. Of course, the viewer would do well to suspend disbelief over Ahmed's seeming overnight learning of the Norsemen's language, as well as over the concept of cavemen riding on horseback. Still, notwithstanding some of these little bumps in the road, this is a film that those who like the action genre will enjoy.",1108857600,3,3441,4.745393634840871
1071282,4,6305692688,"The editorial reviewer compared this film unflatteringly to Braveheart, i actually think it is better.

What i love about this movie is the feel of it, the darkness and gloominess of the movie does an excellent job of transplanting us to those harsh times. I also enjoyed the stark contrast between the two different lands, the Arab kingdom looks warm and civilised and  well ordered whereas the Norse kingdoms are harsh, rugged and cold. It is no wonder that Banderas' character accepts his mission to venture into Northern Europe with 12 wild norse warriors to slay an evil enemy somewhat ruefully. I enjoyed those parts of the film which dealt with ancient rituals and superstitions (such as the readings given by the two elderly witches at different points in the story), and the short description of the self sacrifice of a woman who's husband? has died, she falls into the flaming boat to be consumed with him. Together with the credible portrayal of feudal infighting at the Lords castle all these things do much to bring the story to life.  An interesting thing this film tries to do is blur the boundary between myth/fantasy and reality, Ibn's amazing ability at learning languages quickly is one such event, another revolves around the story of the companions' nemesis, ie the act of killing two special members of the wildmen's tribe leading immediately to total defeat of the tribe (surely the tribe have other leaders?), such contradictions allow us to more easily be seduced by the atmosphere of the film and the director handles them well. Banderas does a good job with the Arab ambassador's role, nothing special, competent. His fellow actors do a good job with the roles of the Norsemen, particularly the guy who played their enigmatic, shy yet brave leader.",1108598400,3,1775,4.91

All of a sudden the Vikings are speaking English, obviously for the benefit of its audience since translator Omar Sharif wasn't going to be around to translate.  Michael Crichton is a gifted writer, but I don't consider this one of his shining moments.

I have heard some complaints from well-known movie critics regarding such things as ""he wasn't a warrior but could suddenly fight"" and ""he learned the norse language very quickly"".  The thing is that this movie gives us all of the information that we require to reconcile everything that happens.  We are told at the beginning that he is a minor noble working as a poet.  This means that he is educated and has been trained in swordplay but (as he says) he is not a warrior, meaning that he has never been in actual battle.  I took it that his gift with language aided him in learning the norse dialect.  The movie was historically accurate right down to the Arabian horse that he was riding which, at that time, would have been a distict cut above any Eurasian horses in terms of speed and agility.

1071340,2,6305692688,"The idea of a culture clash between Moslem and Scandinavian civilizations is nothing new. ""The Longships"" with Sidney Poitier and Richard Widmark covered a lot of the same ground, even though it was campy and ridiculous. However, as laughable as The Longships was, it was actually a better movie and (believe it or not) more historically accurate! That's pretty sad.
Back in the 10th century, Ibn Fadlan (a real person) wrote an account of a Viking funeral he witnessed. In the 6th century, there was a Geatish hero named Beowulf (who was probably a real person: his uncle Hygelac was definitely real) who slew two ogres (Grendel and his mother) who stormed a king's hall and ate the inhabitants. Beowulf later became a king in his own right, but was killed by a dragon, but not before he slew the beast. Michael Crichton melded the two stories (in spite of the 400-year time span -no big deal) and in order to make it more plausible, changed Grendel and his mother into the ""Vendol"", a group of late-surviving Neanderthals who had had superhuman strength (Neanderthals were MUCH stronger than homo sapiens) and domesticated ponies. Crichton also changed the fire-breathing dragon into a column of torch-wielding horsemen. These ideas are so original and intriguing that I for one thought it would be nearly impossible to screw up even if the book was rather lame. It's a truism that bad books make better movies than good ones. Crichton and John McTiernan proved that a bad book can make a bad movie, too.
Unlike some people, I don't get all caught up in languages and accents when it comes to movies as long as there is some sort of consistency. I don't fault movies made in the English-speaking world for using English as the common tongue. If all the people in a village speak with more or less the same British accents -even if the movie takes place somewhere that English isn't even spoken, I don't have a problem unless (as in Dragonslayer) the main characters speak American. That sort of thing ruins the suspension of disbelief. The accents in 13th Warrior didn't bother me. After all, contrary to popular belief, ""Viking"" refers to a profession -NOT an ethnic group. Many Vikings were Slavic, German, English, Scottish, Welsh, and especially Irish. So the diversity among the thirteen warriors rings true in a way.
The problem for me came with the sets, costumes and props. Of the thirteen, only three or four wear the sort of clothes, armor and weapons the Vikings would have worn. The leader wears 15th century plate armor (which would be like depicting George Washington in Kevlar!). Another wears Conquistador armor and carries a Spanish-style two-handed sword. Another wears Gladiator armor! This movie had a large budget, so there's no excuse for this kind of nonsense. I just hope these people don't make a Civil War movie: They'll show the troops at Antietam wearing chainmail and armed with M-16s! Just stupid.
The movie actually starts out promisingly. When the warriors (who are played very well, which is why it gets two stars) volunteer one-by-one, it is a great scene. But once the 13 warriors get on the boat, it's all downhill. Not only does the movie degenerate into a half-hearted rip-off of The Seven Samurai (right down to the last battle being fought in the rain), but it seems to have been chopped down to get the maximum number of showings per day at the multiplex. Why have thirteen heroes when only four get any kind of attention? Most of them have one or two lines and I kept thinking ""Is this guy one of the group?"". Too many characters + too little time and attention = bad moviemaking. Akira Kurosawa isn't just spinning in his grave, he's clawing his way out!
A great premise, a first-rate cast, a great score from Jerry Goldsmith and beautiful scenery in the Pacific Northwest are all wasted in the hands of hack moviemakers like Michael Crichton.
If you want to see a band of heroes save a village, watch ""The Seven Samurai"" or ""The Magnificent Seven"". If you want Muslim/ Norse culture shock, watch ""The Longships"". Sure it's bad, but at least it's bad enough to be unintentionally funny. The 13th Warrior is just plain bad.",1079740800,2,4167,4.772853185595568

I suppose because the movie doesn't give the underlining story or all the customs going on, etc., that it doesn't come across as good as it did when I'd read the book and understood what was going on.
While the movie didn't follow the story exactly, it was pretty close and I'd give the adaptation a much better grade then I gave Timeline, which wasn't all that great in my opinion.  The movie does have some gory scenes, thus the R rating, but it leaves all the  male/female stuff  found in the book out.  All in all I'd give the movie a recommendation to watch, I'm not all that sure it's one to buy, watching it once (or perhaps twice) is plenty, it just doesn't have the strength of action and message as say Braveheart or Gladiator.

1071344,5,6305692688,"The 13th Warrior stars antonio banderas in an unusual role, yet he flawlessly manages to convincingly portray an arab of the times. Actually based upon a book by micheal crithon , it is no wonder this movie is so compelling in it's story. The movie begins with Banderas narating and laying out the plot. The year is around the 9th century if I remember correctly, and the islamic sultans are at a height of power, leading a civilization that is much more ""civilized"" and technologically advanced than the western european kingdoms of the time. Banderas is a poet from Bagdad who falls in love with the wife of a powerful man. Out of jeolousy, Banderas's character is made ambassidor to the ""barbarian"" lands of the north. As he makes his way with his envoy through the caususus mountains to the vast steppes of what is now russia, he and his caravan come under attack by the tartars, only to be saved by the apearance of a viking longship which scares them off.
It is here that the story really begins. An arrogant Arab, Banderas is introduced to the strange and ""barbaric"" world of the norsemen. This cultural variety adds depth and an unusual element to the story, as arabs and vikings ussually don't sit side by side on the silver screen. While attempting to learn about these northmen, who seem so strange to banderas and his more conservative arab customs, the unexpected happens. A young boy shows up from scandanavia to ask for assistance combating a great evil which is attacking his homeland - an evil ""which must not be said"". A norse oracle calls for 13 warriors to be dispatched to fight this evil. After 12 big vikings volunteer, the oracle informs them that the 13th warrior must be no norsemen, and all heads turn to bandaras. Thus bandaras is caught up on this strange quest and is in for a good deal of adventure.
The action of the movie is enjoyable and intense and the story is original enough to gain my applause based on setting and characters alone. The 13th warrior really succeeds in creating familiar enough adventure story, with a very healthy dose of creativity. The relationship between the arab and the norse is particularly interesting. Eventually this gap, is closed and these two very different cultures learn respect and admiration of one another. Banderas last naration in the film illustrates this beautifully: ""Praise be to Allah, the Merciful and Compassionate. May his blessing be upon pagan men who loved other gods, who shared theirfood, shed their blood, that his servant, Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan, might become a man and a useful servant of God.""
The 13th warrior is a great adventure film, with plenty of originallity, and while some aspects of the plot are left to our own imagination, it leaves just enough to give you something to ponder once the credits role. The cinematography is excellent, and the director should be commended. Acting too was excellent, and scripting and diologue was top notch integrating just the right about of witty discourse, epic naration, and a touch of humor at times. All together, the 13th warrior is a great movie and a welcome change from the repetative plots and settings of similar films.",1075161600,2,3162,4.782449725776965

For me, ""The 13th Warrior"" lacked the interest and appeal of Crichton's novel.  The rewarding aspects of this film are the battle scenes and the interesting interplay between the North Men and Banderas's character.  Another interesting scene occurs near the beginning when Banderas's character is trying to pick up the language of the North Men.  The audio in the film slowly melds from a foreign language into English-slowly fades into understanding.  While the characters of the mist are intriguing and the battle scenes in this movie are up to par, the rest of the script lacks depth and sincerity.

Antonio Banderas is a descent actor and I like him to be in the Zoro show, but he should not be the selling point of this movie.  He's totally awkward there--the viking venture is not his business at all.  The producer tried to attract audience using his stardom, but only make me loose my fandom.  His face every second on the screen is simply too much, and only makes him a clown--all we can see is his startled looks--that's not what I expect from a viking saga.  On the contrary, all the other warriors are elegant, confident, and exudes charisma, especially Vladimir Kulich (short for VK), who plays the chieftan of the 13 warriors--Buliwyf (Beuwulf, the hero of the oldest English epic poetry--the beginning of English lietrature).  I can never say too much good things about this fine artist--yes, not just an actor, but a real artist!  It's so hard to attract attention when the editor just cuts his scene blatantly to show another startled looks of Branderas, but still VK quietly steals the show.
The movie missed a great chance to be as big as Lord of the Ring because of an executive mistake--instead of focusing on good story and resounding characters (all those warriors have their own great characteristics, if developed appropriately), the movie just attempt to squeeze in an irrelevant role, making up reasons for an Arab to be there so they can sell poor Antonio Banderas.  Have they ever realized what they have missed? Stars are important to make a big hit, but charismatic chracters are more important.  Without good story, the star will be a victim instead of a hero.  If this movie shows a little deeper studies of the original Beuwulf, and focus on Vladimir Kulich and other warrior players, it CAN be better!

Based on the novel ""Eaters of the Dead"" by Michael Crichton (my personal favorite), this film follows a muslim who gets 'volunteered' to go with a group of Norsemen to serve as the, you guessed it, 13th warrior. Being that he's not a warrior it comes as a bit of a shock.
He reluctantly agrees, and ends up traveling back to the Norsemen's home, in the meantime learning their language.
When they arrive home, they find that their town has been attacked by a creature so evil, that they dare not even speak it's name. They begin to investigate a homestead that had been attacked, and bring the wrath of the enemy down on their town. They begin to build their defenses, and the attack comes....
The cinematography was excellent, and the battle sequences were tremendous. They remind me of sequences from Braveheart, so they are a bit much for children. Banderas did a good job in this film, as did the rest of the actors, most of which I had never seen before. I think by using few well-known actors, it made the film feel that much more foreign (we're supposed to be following Banderas, the enlightened one into the home of the barbarians).

1071402,4,6305692688,"Film director John McTiernan's ""The 13th Warrior"" is such a frustrating film. There's much to love about this robust viking epic, including a handful of terrific actors with an appealing presence, excellent period detail, memorable battle sequences and a fantastic musical score by the always-dependable Jerry Goldsmith. But why did the studio editors have to cut this film to pieces?!
When watching this action movie, any viewer with half a brain can tell that multiple scenes must have been left on the cutting room floor. Supporting characters disappear without a trace, continuity is fragmented and illogical, the ending is abrupt and unsatisfying. At one point the vikings are traveling by ship, the next they are riding cross country on horseback.
So it's a pleasant surprise that even after such annoying studio interference, ""The 13th Warrior"" still succeeds on several levels. Based on Michael Crichton's novel ""Eaters of the Dead,"" a whimsical interpretation of the Olde English tale ""Beowulf,"" this film (like the book) changes the dragon into a cannibalistic horde of viscious warriors terrorizing a remote village. A ragtag group of vikings, in the best tradition of ""The Magnificient Seven,"" soon come to the rescue with unwitting Arabic ambassador Ahmed (Antonio Banderas) in tow.
Several great scenes will stay with the viewer, among them Ahmed's touching dalliance with a willowy viking maiden (who disappears by the film's end), Ahmed's humorous camaraderie with his new viking friends, Bulvine's (Beowulf's) fatal stand prior to the final battle, and Omar Sharif's brief cameo at the film's beginning.
Bulvine's viking burial, which should have been one of the ultimate highlights of this film, is shown as if an afterthought during a far too brief montage. The relationship between Bulvine, aging warrior king Hrothgar and Hrothgar's wife (played by the talented Diane Venora), also appears to have been a victim of impatient editors. With the recent success of the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, it's obvious viewers have no complaints about sitting through a finely detailed epic fantasy, so it comes as a rather sad note that what could have been an equally superb fantasy film has been so severely butchered.
I would love to see a Director's Cut of ""The 13th Warrior,"" with the missing scenes added. John McTiernan has proven his action muscle in the past with the underrated ""Predator,"" and the creative ""Die Hard."" ""The 13th Warrior"" is a good film, and I enjoy watching it repeatedly.

Interesting stuff for a literary novel, and perhaps for a film on a more epic (or more subtle) scale.  But in actionfest format, it fails.  Whole slabs of plot and character development seem to have been excised to make way for action or trifling, insignificant scenes.

While journeying to the North, Eban and his companion Melchisidek (Omar Sharif) come across a Viking encampment. There they are celebrating the ""funeral"" of their late King. At first, Eban finds the Vikings rowdy and sometimes unpleasant, however, in time he develops an understanding and respect for the Viking warriors and is welcomed into their society by their leader, Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich). Word reaches the group that Buliwyf's homeland is being ravaged by The Wendol, an invading force monsters/men that will destroy and eat anything in their path - including the flesh of the men they have killed.

However, before they leave, an oracle informs them that 13 warriors must be chosen to return to the North. Just as the 12th warrior volunteers, they are told that the 13th Warrior must be an outsider. Now whom can they get to accompany them on their quest?

The film builds a nice bit of suspense and atmosphere around the Wendol by not revealing their true nature until late in the film, while showing us some of their handy work early on. There is also plenty of gore and decapitations. The film uses very natural lighting, which gives The 13th Warrior a more authentic feel. While some of the battles take place at night and are hard to see, this helps add to the confusion caused by the Wendols' attacks. The battle scenes are definitely the film's strongest point, though, and the action is really good. If there is a failing, it's the fact many of the characters are underdeveloped. The film features 13 warriors (duh) and believe me by the end you'll be hard pressed to remember half of them.

Antonio Banderas stars as an outcast Arab poet who falls in with a band of Viking adventurers.  When word reaches the Vikings that one of their castles is under siege from a legendary foe too terrible to be named, their shaman dictates that Banderas must accompany the Norsemen on their relief mission or it will be doomed to failure.  And so, the lucky number 13 in the flesh, Banderas embarks on an incredible adventure in which he must learn to fight or die, and comes face to face with the ultimate taboo:  cannibalism.
This movie was not a blockbuster, but it should've been.  The script is intelligent , the performances realistic, the sets lavish, and most importantly the action is just incredible.  Moreover, the story is noteworthy for its largely credible depiction of Viking life, which may have been barbaric to some but which had its own unique and inimitable charm--which Banderas comes to slowly appreciate for himself, particulary Viking mead and Nordic women.  The intense Norse belief in heroism and honor is prominent in this movie, and the Viking leader's last stand is both moving and powerful.

Antonio Banderas plays an Arab who joins up with twelve Viking warriors recruited to fight what seems to be a band of cannibalistic monsters who are wiping out whole villages in the Norse land. Along the way, Banderas learns their language and begins to help the warriors, who doubt his fighting abilities because of his small horse and smaller sword.  After repelling an attack, the warriors decide to track the cannibals back to their cave, where they kill a priestess. After making it back to their adopted village, they wait for the climactic, gory, and vengeful battle.
I think I liked this movie so much because it jumped feet first into the mayhem, and yet kept the picture centered around Banderas and the warriors. ""Jurassic Park III"" jumped into the mayhem, but then started killing characters off so fast, you did not care. Here, Banderas provides a solid anchor to the film, and his compatriots are very likeable.
Another plus: no forced romance. Banderas has a purely physical fling, but we do not have a Viking fall in love with a cannibal (ouch!) or Banderas discovering his paramour in his saddlebag at the battle so she can prove even women can fight people eaters. The story is very straightforward, think of it as a remake of ""The Magnificent Seven"" crossed with ""Quest for Fire."" Another plus is the fact that the Vikings do not suddenly invent the world's first grenade or a machine gun that shoots horse dung. They have swords and arrows. They fight with swords and arrows.
The location filming in British Columbia is breathtaking. The movie is very cloudy, dark, and grim, and this works. Jerry Goldsmith's score enhanced the creepiness of every scene, and McTiernan proves he can direct some excellent action film that have more behind them than just explosions (like the first ""Die Hard"", although avoid ""Nomads"").
I think the studio marketing department screwed up this film. I expected a weak comedy about peace lover Banderas trying not to fight in a war. The ad campaign never mentioned who the enemy was, or even what time period this took place in. I think action and Crichton fans will be impressed with this film. I know I was. I highly recommend ""The 13th Warrior.""
This is rated (R) for strong physical violence, strong gore, mild profanity, and adult situations.",1023235200,14,2414,4.830917874396135
1071490,5,6305692688,"If you enjoy mythology and folklore then you should see this movie. Though Crichton changed the story a little and the characters names(example: Beowulf to Buliwyf) slightly the story remains loyal. If you have read some viking/nordic stories like Grendal or Beowulf then you will enjoy this movie more so than other people. Heck, I've had a friend of mine ask me who Joan of Arc was when we saw the messenger, but that has nothing to do with this...
Anyway, I would have wished The 13th Warrior was a longer movie, it would be great to see more of Vladmir Kulich preformance as Buliwyf as well as the other important characters(not to be bias or anything). Which brings to my main disappointment: there is NO extra footage, NO interviews, NO behind the scenes, sort of goodies on the DVD! No goodies what-so-ever, nada, nein, nyet, none at all! That's what DVD's are for, right? (might be because the movie was on the shelf for two years before it was released, there is a long story behind that but I won't get it to it; I'm sparing you the headache *too late* LOL)

1071493,4,6305692688,"I just watched this movie again-my 8th viewing-and I'm compelled to upgrade my rating.  The 13th Warrior just gets better each time I see it.  Buliwyf (Vladimir Kulich) is a man's man, wow, this guy is the hero every little boy wants to grow up to be.  Herger the Joyous (Dennis Storhi) is how every class clown visualizes himself, and then remembers himself as, once he becomes a senior-citizen; and Antonio Banderas as Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Rashid Ibn Abbas Ibn Bashirevery has to be the graphic every romantic scholar has as his desktop.
  The religious view of Herger regarding ones fate is pure: ""The Old Father wrote the end of your life long ago, go and hind in a hole if you wish, but you won't live one moment longer: your fate is fixed.  Fear profit man nothing.""
  You want an adventurer's prayer, well here's the Norsemen's prayer before battle:
""Lo there do I see my father.
Lo there do I see my mother.
Lo there do I see my brothers and my sisters.
Lo there do I see the line of my people back to the beginning.
Lo they do call to me;
 they bid me take my place among them in the Halls of Valhalla,
where the brave may live forever.""
  Wow.  Where's my sword?
  I have to admit that Ahmed's prayer before the battle he believed he'd die in had me scrambling to find where it came from.  He was asking the ""Merciful Father,"" for forgiveness for ""all we aught to have thought, but never thought; all we aught to have said, but never said; and all we aught to have done, but never done.""
  Whether in print or on film, it's lines like these that make a great Romantic Adventure great.  They make you want to be more, to strive for more.  Maybe even to acknowledge that there is something outside of you, as Jean-Pierre (Michael Lonsdale) pointed out to Sam (Robert De Niro) in Ronin, that is worth making a stand for, fighting for, even worth the ultimate sacrifice.
  And it's lines like these that make a movie eminently rewatchable.

1071542,1,6305692688,"The 13th Warrior proved to one of the most troubled productions in recent years. ... The movie has a couple of saving graces, which I will get to later.
The time is 922 AD, and the date may be part of the trouble. We're in the Dark Ages. Those are the four or five centuries they skip over in high school. Even so, it doesn't feel historically accurate, though it looks it. While the story is purportedly based on the writing of an Arabian named Ahamad Ibn Fadlen, I suspect that that ancient writer had a very vivid imagination.
Ahamad is played by Antonio Banderas, who, though a fine actor, is wrong as the hero of this testosterone-driven epic. In an all too quick prolog, Ahamad is driven from the court for having an affair with the sultan's favorite wife. He winds up in a desolate land where he is pursued by Tartars. He is saved by some friendly Norsemen and winds up going back to Scandinavia with twelve of them who are called to save a kingdom from some truly horrid creatures. Thus, he is the 13th warrior. From that point on, it is one bloody battle after another. There is enough carnage to fill four or five other movies, and if blood and guts are your thing, then this is your movie. I found it all a bit tedious. It was as though time were being filled in a rather thin story. Nothing makes a lot of sense here. There is a subplot about the king's son trying to undermine the warriors, but why he does this is unclear. It's an excuse for yet another fight, perhaps. Then, there is the enemy. There were such ugly beings still around back then, but it beyond belief that they were capable of the feats we see them perform in this movie.
And the saving graces? The 13th Warrior is handsomely photographed. Some of the shots are breathtaking. The costumes and the set designs are first rate. The Scandinavian actors who play the other warriors are quite good. None of these elements are enough to save the picture.
While watching this movie, I had a thought. Today, there are basically two groups making movies. There is the hip, cutting edge group which makes films like The Matrix, The Truman Show and Being John Malchovich. The other group is the formula crowd. Their movies are often brilliant, but they are in a style perfected over half a century ago. The 13th Warrior is definitely derived from the latter formula. I bring this thought up because you would think that, after all these years, it would be impossible to get the formula so wrong.",1016582400,8,2465,4.467849223946785
1071543,5,6305692688,"I liked this film and the bad reviews came as a surprise after having already watched it. What I like most about this story is the fact that the narrator, a nobleman who comes from a highly sofisticated society, is not a macho-man dare-anything hero, but a poet who has never in his life seen a battle. His cultural shock when he finds these barbarians --the Vikings-- is enormous and we just see everything through his eyes and from his point of view. The fact that he doesn't know the Viking language and needs first a translator (from Latin, which he doesn't speak either) and then to learn the Viking language is one of the difficulties that he finds and link us to him: we (us and him) don't understand anything. Another big problem that makes us sympathize with him is that he goes unwillingly on this adventure. When he is thrown in the middle of chaos and bloody fight, we see what he sees, that is, we don't realise that the enemies are men and not beasts until we see it through his eyes.
The clash of cultures is the main theme of this adventure movie: there is the clash between the Vikings and the Arab traveller; but, most importantly, they really begin to respect each other and to find out what they have in common when they must fight against the terrible Wendol, who are different and illogical to the point of being incompatible as neighbours, and must be destroyed.",1014681600,2,1385,4.5
1071544,5,6305692688,"Unfairly savaged by the professional critics, THE 13TH WARRIOR is easily one of the best films in the genre.  I enjoyed it far more than I did GLADIATOR.  Most critics seemed to review the budget and the films troubled history rather than giving an objective view on the movie itself.  This movie has more  atmosphere, a better soundtrack, likable characters and more interesting locations, it's a far better movie all round.  The scenes where they infiltrate the enemies haven are amazing.  Something else that I found pleasing is that for a movie where a group of people are thrown together to fight an evil force they haven't just drawn the characters as say, the smart arse guy, the nasy guy who won't take orders from anyone, the nice and sweet guy, the nervous guy as in films like ALIENS which I think is overated in the extreme partly for that reason.  In this film they all know they have a job to do and they work together to try and get it done.  That's not to say that the characters don't have personalities, it's just that they are more subtle and realistic without every charcter being some obvious stereotype.  The battle scenes are bloodthirsty, brutal and chaotic, which is the way they should be, although this is in no way the all action no story crapfest some have said it to be.  I have recommended and shown the film to many people and literaly no one has been disappointed.
The DVD is another story, while the picture quality is excellent the disc no extras of any note, hopefully John McTiernan's longer cut of the film will see the light of day sometime and be put out in a special edition, but i'm not holding my breath.

The acting was excellent, the action scenes were very exciting, and it still has enough gore for those purists. See this if you like those mid age action flicks!

Worth the price 'of the ticket' are actors Dennis Storhoi and Vladmir Kulich, who steal the showcase from Banderas, with strong performances as the Norsemen who lead the band of fearless warriors against the horde of near supernatural menace.

In the genre of historically-based movies such as Braveheart, Rob Roy, The Messenger, and Elizabeth, it was about time a decent Viking movie came out.
My only complaints were this:
Antonio Banderas' performance was good, but not convincing enough to portray himself as an Arab. There was also insufficient lighting in certain scenes (the darkness may have been a deliberate attempt to represent the chaos of nighttime battles), but this movie is WELL worth watching nonetheless.

1071617,4,6305692688,"This movie got a great deal of flak from ""professional"" movie reviewers, so I put off seeing it for quite some time. I found much of the criticism unwarranted.
The film is one of the better book adaptations I've seen, and it should be - The Eaters of the Dead's author, Michael Crichton, also penned the movie script. Though the first few sequences seemed rushed, the overall pacing and tone of the film are very effective. The scenery is lush (it's so nice to see a movie that's filmed primarily on location for a change), the sets remarkable, and the costumes excellent. Though Antonio Banderas seems miscast as Ibin Fahdlan, he does a decent job with the part. The real stars of the movie, however, are the mighty Norsemen. Vladimir Kulich, Dennis Storhi, and the raucous but noble host of others embody every boyhood dream I had of what Vikings should be. The only distraction from this party of merry warriors is their various nationalities lead to various accents. Oh well.  They sure look the part and look as though they're having the times of their lives.
The ""monsters"" are effective, but somewhat underwhelming. The battle scenes, choreographed well by director John McTiernan (Die Hard), are engrossing, and they are the reason I rented the movie in the first place.  Overall, it's an engaging film, full of action and suspense.  Enjoy!

That is the spirit of their formidable leader, Beowulf, King of the Geats.  Only in this movie Beowulf is a chieftan of the Rus, the Viking invaders of Dark Ages Russia.  The author took considerable license with Beowulf's saga, whether for good or ill let another judge.  As I see it, the result was a great action/adventure story.

Some striking features of the story:  The prayer/poem recited by the doomed maiden at the chieftan's funeral, repeated by Beowulf and his thanes before the final battle.  The growth of Ibn Faladan from a foppish dandy to an accomplished fighting man.  The Vikings' exuberant, lusty love of life juxtaposed against their nonchalant willingness to kill and die.

My favorite scene came when the witch was called in to take the auguries and advise on a course of action.  She threw some bones and made some passes and decreed that thirteen warriors must embark upon a quest which would end in almost certain death.  Twelve went eagerly and the thirteenth, Ibn Faladan, reluctantly.

Antonio Banderas plays an explorer who is exiled from Baghdad and sent to the North to serve as ""ambassador"" ... although he knows why he is sent, and is resigned to the idea.  When he is named by a seer as the 13th warrior who must join the Norsemen when they go to the Saxon territories (at the request of a lord/prince) to fight the ""monsters"" (who turn out to be, essentially, a neolithic culture), he gains a new understanding of life and of himself.  There is only one jarring moment in the film, and that is when Banderas finds himself, as if by magic, suddenly able to understand the Germanic tongue of his hosts without appearing to have studied the language at all.  This is a significant departure from the book, in which one of the Norsemen helps him to learn a bit of the language and he slowly begins to comprehend.

The movie is however not without its loopholes. Arabs, even today, are rarely without facial hair. In 922 A.D., a clean shaven Banderas would have been branded a ""kaffir"" in Baghdad and stoned to death or punished in a way similar to those lines. Another misrepresentation is that of the Vikings. Bulwiyf.....a clean shaven dude??? The Vikings were unkempt and uncouth, and yet a few shaved and kept themselves Gillette smooth. Now thats some misnomenclature. Also,according by Ibn Fahdlan's description, the Viking women were sexually wanton. Did we see much of it??? Well, Banderas had a roll in the hay (literally) with one, but then, for the sake of the book, a few wanton scenes could have corroborated to that fact. Furthermore, Diane Venora looked so plebian, it was hard to believe that she was the white shrouded, be-jewelled Queen Weilew. These and more facts somewhat contradict whats' in the book, but the movie is not bad at all. The music is very chilling and apt. The performances by Storhoi (Herger)and Kulich (Bulwiyf) are paces ahead of Bandera's. The climactic battle is very passionately fought, albeit a short one.

1071625,5,6305692688,"The 13th Warrior is, without a doubt, the most underrated film of 1999 - and perhaps one of the most underrated of all time, for that matter. It came and went at the box office and has also received a lackluster DVD edition that includes very few interesting features. However, the film itself is top notch. It is a thinking man's action picture, a historical fantasy, an intriguing mystery, a Braveheart-style epic, and a brilliant retelling of Beowulf all at once.
The plotline revolves around Antonio Banderas who portrays a refined but very exiled Arab courtier who by chance encounters a band of Vikings on their way to rid a King's lands of an evil that they will not name. Banderas is chosen to accompany them to the King's realm and assist them in their battle against this nightmarish enemy who feeds on the flesh of its vanquished foes. From there, this passionate and thrilling adventure begins. All of this is, of course, based on the novel ""Eaters of the Dead,"" by Michael Crichton. Though the film adaptation and the novel part ways at several points, they are excellent companions to one another - not unlike Banderas and the Vikings. I recommend both novel and film equally and highly, and one only furthers the enjoyment of the other.
The 13th Warrior is such an overwhelming experience that it racks up an amazingly lengthy list of praises. The cinematography is breath-taking and captures a mysterious, beautiful, and ancient landscape in a way that film seldom can; Jerry Goldsmith's score is rousing, inspiring, and very worthy of notation; Banderas and the film's other key players give wonderful and convincing performances; the battle sequences are first rate, as are the rest of the film's production values... The list goes on and on. Truly, the film's only weakness comes from the fact that sometimes it seems to presume that all those who are viewing it have read the book beforehand, and therefore gives less description to certain cases and places and things than it probably should. The pacing is somewhat quick and jerky near the beginning as well. None of this detracts all that much, though, from the resounding experience that is The 13th Warrior.  The 13th Warrior belongs next to the likes of Gladiator, Braveheart, and Conan the Barbarian, and it is a crying shame that the movie seems to have drawn so little attention to itself. This is absolutely one of the best fantasy films ever made - and for those who do not like fantasy, it has all the makings of a ""what-if?"" war picture of epic proportions.

1071694,5,6305692688,"Have you ever read Beowulf, the 12th century poem written by an anonymous poet?  You want to get a Hollywood version of Beowulf's tale? I suddenly realized that this was truly his tale after I finished The Tower Of Beowulf by Parke Godwin, and only because I remembered one scene at the very end of the film that was remeniscent of the final scene in the story.  It's The 13th Warrior. It is told from the annonymous poet's point of view in the movie, but Bulwyf is Beowulf, and he truly does go to help King Hrothgar with his demon problem, although in the movie, it's the Wendor trying to make you think they're bears, whereas in the story, Grendel is really a demon haunting the great hall. After reading the story and watching the movie, I can see where they combined all the characters into one story to condense it a bit.  For example, Edgetho is Beowulf's father in the story, not Hygelac, and in the movie Edgetho is one of Bulwyf's sword companions.  Prince Wigliff is actually Beowulf's successor when he becomes King of the Geats after King Hygelac's son is killed in a raid instead of King Hrothgar's son as in the movie.  And Wigliff in the movie is boastful, distainful of Bulwyf, and said to have killed his brothers, which means he's filling the role of Unferth the boaster, who is contemptuous of Beowulf at first and accidentally killed his brother, and Hrothulf, the nephew of King Hrothgar and the murderer of his two sons after he dies.  Confused yet? Let me tell you more.  In the original story, Beowulf travels to King Hrothgar, the Lord of the Danes, to help him defeat Grendel and stop the demon from ruling the great alehall, Heorot. Then Beowulf returns home and much later when he's old and gray and King of the Geats, he takes on the dragon in the underground cave with twelve other young warriors and the thief, a foreign slave, who disturbed the dragon in the first place.  I have a feeling that the Arab in the movie was supposed to represent that thief/foreign slave who had to show the warriors where the dragon and the hoard was.  Anyway, Beowulf ends up dying from wounds given to him by the dragon over a great treasure. He dies sitting up against a tree and looking out over the world in front of him with his sword stuck into the ground beside him.  Wiglif, his second cousin twice removed, succeeds him as King of the Geats and buries him on the pile of treasure that had created greed, strife, and ultimately, the dragon itself.  You see, the northern peoples believed that when you were so consumed with avarice that you took on the shape of that evil; hence, the dragon.  Clever, eh?  Well, the movie brought all these things together, got rid of the dragon altogether, made Grendel the Wendor, and had the final real fight in the underground sea cave.  I didn't figure it out that it was the Beowulf tale until I read the book and remembered Bulwyf sitting down at the end and thrusting his sword into the ground next to him, to die of fatal wounds while staring out at the world.  Very clever indeed.  I don't think very many people realize that Michael Crighton took that poem and rewrote it in a more modern tale to tell it to people once more.  I was just lucky that I read the story after I saw the movie.  No one knows that they are getting that story that was written so long ago no one remembers it but those who grew up with it. Very cool.  I recommend this film not only because of the cinematography and the well written script (there are some great lines like:  ""What do I do?""  ""Keep your teeth together and go back to work!"", but also because it reintroduces a beloved story in a form that modern audiences can really enjoy.",993513600,5,3683,4.442793462109956

Most of Michael Crichton's other work that has been made into movies didn't turn out very well. At least not if you had read the book before seeing the movie. As always, this movie was not as good as the book, but it was a pretty good attempt. Surprisingly, Antonio Banderas was almost perfect for the lead role.  I'm obviously not a big fan of what Hollywood usually does to books that I enjoyed, but this was actually a pretty good adaptation. I can see where if you just saw the movie without having read the book, it might seem a little weak and shallow.  But if you read the book first and get all of Crichton's asides and research into the time period and cultures that are represented, then the movie will make a lot more sense and be a more enjoyable experience.",991267200,,863,4.3875

This is, essentially, a tale of good versus evil with a good deal of action, suspense and a minor love interest. The film makes a serious attempt at depicting medieval warfare (the ships used were built for the movie) and portrays life in this period as something close to what it was: grim and dirty. It does point up how that Arabs were much more civilized than the barbarians from the North and there are some amusing moments when the cultured Banderas copes with the ways of the barbarians.

Antonio Banderas turns in an excellent performance that takes him from an inexperienced, accidental warrior who can barely hold a Viking sword to a turn true fighting man who keeps up with his bolder companions.

The Supposedly Terrifying Bad Guys are also non-existent; they have been replaced by a bunch of Bear Skins on Horses. The Best acting the film has to offer is given by every actor who has to pretend these things are Scary, give them all an Oscar.
Omar Sharif and Diane Venora are Criminally Underused; together they have about 15 minutes of Screen time. The film is stocked with Giant Viking Warriors who are actually Nice, Funny and Interesting Characters. It's a Real Shame that the film wastes these Characters by never letting them Develop or have a moment to shine.

Its fantasy, not reality. Banderas then becomes-you guessed it, the 13th Warrior, after a fortune-teller wanrs them they won't last without him.

It's not so much the Arab among Vikings part that I'm worried about, because it was in the book EATERS OF THE DEAD. I HATE the other title, it sounds boring. Eaters of the dead is so much more exciting-sounding. Anyway, I've been around many Saudi Arabians in college so I know how they look like, and personally, I thought those Hollywood casting gurus could have done a better job. With so many people out there wanting to be actors they should have had no problem finding an ARAB for the part of the ARAB. Duh! While you watch this movie you find yourself saying, ""isn't that that charming romancy guy from Zorro?"" Banderas is not near as charming in this movie--thank goodness!--but I didn't find him come across as very violent. The battle scenes are full of blood and gore, but could have used more. The Vikings were casted very well, but they looked too clean at times. In the book I visualized them as dirtier, the women were uglier, and the book made them sound FAR more violent. The scene where Beowulf-equivalent kills the Grendel-leader is not all that great. Slow motion and you don't get to see much of the action. Guess the camera-man was asleep on the job or something. The movie follows the book about half of the time. But there are some parts where I felt that the book was better. The ending in the book was better, the part with the dwarves was neat. I didn't find the Grendel all that scary, either. In the book they were far more hairy and violent and I'm not sure they were even human. I'm more than sure that the Momma-Grendel was very hairy and ugly, not hairless as in the movie. Overall an okay movie, worth seeing once or twice.

1071746,3,6305692688,"Hmm....this one is a real toss up.  First, let me say that the DVD is nothing special. The only bonus is the trailer, which is very unfortunate.  What's the point of releasing a movie on DVD, especially at that price, without adding anything interesting?
As far as the movie goes, I enjoyed it, it was interesting, and when it was over I felt it was time well spent.  I loved seeing a movie with Vikings that actually has some accuracy in terms of Vikings being more than grunters and hitters.  The fight scenes were amazing, and being set at night, the lack of lighting really puts the viewer into the midst of the confusion that battle is.  I also like that very little of it is cliched.
However, that said, this is a story and a film that could have been so much more.  Apart from Banderas' hit-and-miss acting style, that's my only real beef with the movie - it falls short of it potential.  The guys playing Vikings, who may or may not have acted before (I don't know) are so natural and so good, and Banderas, the Big-Name-Star of the movie, isn't as good as them.  The plot is great - an Arab poet who ends up being chosen the 13th in a group of 13 warriors to go battle the mythical northland Wendol, learns the languages, teaches the leader how to write in Arabic, and they end up saving the people, but not before having a lot of their people killed.  The Arab, a poet, also learns courage and confidence on the way.  But, still, it doesn't deliver the goods it is constantly promising.  Another 30 minutes worth of scenes, to let us know who these people are, and to offer some more development in between the battles, would be an immense help to this movie, and would have taken it from a great fantasy movie to an incredible epic.  The cinematography was there - great landscape shots, fantastic battle scenes, simply some wonderfully creative and impressive film work.  The acting, mostly, was topnotch and natural.  You have mythical beasts of an almost mythical time and a story of one man coming to learn he is much more than he ever thought he could be, learning from a foreign people and an win-or-die situation, and those people also learning from him.  Beowulf and other stories all mixed together.  Enjoyable, fun, really cool movie that really should have been, and easily could have been, a lot more than it ended up being.
And please stop comparing it to Braveheart - the subject material is so different, and the stories are so different, that to say ""It's no Braveheart"" is meaningless.  Please don't think that just because a movie has swords and guys with long hair that it must be ""Braveheart-like"".",984614400,3,2629,4.536016949152542
1071747,1,6305692688,"I know I'm going to get shot down for this one, but I just have to disagree with all the people who think this is an excellent film.  Antonio Banderas plays an Arab poet who joins a group of Vikings to slay some beast in the north.  Taking leaps and bounds, Antonio's character suddenly learns their language almost instantly (although it's hard to tell, there's very little sense of time throughout the film).  That's not the last giant leap, either; this movie plays out like a bad Dungeons and Dragons game with the dumbest person in the world running it.  The other characters in the film are completely uninspiring, and much like ""The Cell"", I just wished everyone would die so I could leave the theater.
The cinematography is good at some points, but horribly murky at other times.  The costumes, especially the armor, are laughable, and the filler scenes between the gratuitious battle scenes are just that, filler.  They are supposed to give the characters ""depth"" and ""emotion"", but it's about as deep and emotional as a kindergarten play.  No explanation is ever given as to why the creatures Antonio and company are out to slay have started attacking the local residents.
This is a horrible rip-off of the Seven Samurai, as someone else pointed out.  Long, dull and contrived, the only way you'll like this movie is if you actually thought ""The Cell"" was a good movie too.  Don't believe everything you read others, and avoid this film!",984528000,5,1447,4.756

Crichton has written a really cool story that postulates that the oldest known written-English language story, BEOWULF, (whose author is anonymous) may have been written by an Arab adventurer (Antonio Banderas' character).  The character names are slightly off (eg. Buliwyf is Beowulf etc.), but this would be a result of the translation from the Norse language to Arabic to English.  The movie does a fantastic job of showing us the Fireworm, Grendel (they call them the Wendol in the movie) and pretty much stays true to the legend.  The big thrill for those who have read Beowulf is how Crichton finds plausible ""real-world"" ways to explain the more mystical aspects of the Beowulf legend.  eg. The monster (The Grendel), is actually an army of savage warriors.  I won't spoil how they explain the Fireworm.  This is an underrated movie.  I will admit that it really helps if you are able to view it with Beowulf in mind.  I wish they could have shown this to us in high school when we had to read it.",982800000,2,1112,4.661538461538462

What I did get was nearly two hours of a decent, entertaining, hack and slash adventure story and I was happy with that.
I think because it takes place in the Middle Ages and has lots of sabre-rattling people compare this film to Braveheart. C'mon folks, Braveheart was a one of a kind, sweeping, romantic epic. Hollywood rarely makes those anymore. 13th Warrior is a genre piece, an action movie. Hollywood makes dozens of those a year.

The movie is dark; the filming is exceptional at times.  Most of the scenes are captivating, though they won't stand the scrutiny of multiple viewings.  Particularly weak are the scenes in the cave.  On the other hand...the scene where Banderas learns the nordic tongue is as well-done as any I've seen in this sort of film...and alone is worth the price of rental.

1071837,4,6305692688,"A Nice retelling of the old Beowulf story. In Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, the samurais and the peasants are very different in their nature. The peasants wanted the samurai's to guard them from the bandits, but at the same time they regarded the samurai's as another kind of exploiters. And the samurai's were mercineries. But In this movie and in the Beowulf epic, the warriors are kinsmen of the king Hrothgar who sent for rescue from the Wendol, or Grendel. Though some tactics with which they deal with the adversaries resemble that in SS, it's really the retelling of Beowulf and I find some people here have the same idea. When I first read Michael Crichton's novel I didn't realize, but slowly the old story of a Danish hero I read twenty years ago, and the movie 'Beowulf' starred by Christopher Lambert struck as the parallels of this title. So far for the comparison.
 This is however, more feasible, ripped off of the color of legend. Not a single hero, but teamwork and cooperation do the job. Surely Crichton must have taken great pains figuring out what monstrous fiend had so much terrified the warlike and fierce north men. Was it just another more warlike tribe like Huns, or was it the last remnants of Neanderthals? Read ""Eaters of the Dead"" or now retitled as ""The 13th Warrior"" by Michael Crichton for such questions.

This movie lacks that feeling, but then this IS an action movie, not a horror flick. And it is a very good movie too, especially the 1st hour. A well done intro sets the frame for the story, and off we go. Banderas is very good, but the vikings are truly magnificent - laconic, raw, violent, they are simply an excellent cast.
 Ok, the here are the gripes:
 the premise in Crichton's book... well, let's not give anything away here, let's just talk about the Enemy. Anyway, the Enemy uses horses, and a lot of them. Not only it is extremely unlikely that this would even have been possible, there wasn't probably that many horses in the whole of Norway at that time. Stupid, stupid, stupid. In another scene you can see a corn snake (or likewise) hanging around the neck of a tribal shaman, again a completely idiotic ""add-on"". I can't even imagine why somebody invented stuff like this, especially since almost all other props, clothes & stuff were quite authentic-looking. And Crichton's strength lies in his believability, constructing a ""real"" world by joining facts and potentially true facts. If I remember correctly the book was published as a translation (from arabic) of a ""autentic"" diary recently found somewhere. The movie doesn't live up to this feeling of autenticity, and thus loses one dimension (like: what if the Enemy still is around somewhere...). You also get a feeling that either money or time was running out (unfortunately not an uncommon occurence in action flicks, either that or it was badly cut), since the last part can't really keep up with the first, excellent hour.
 However, the battle scenes are great, the cast is fantastic (I really like those fatalistic norsemen) and generally it is simply a good movie. The reason I am nagging is that it could have been a really great movie. Add 30 mins, remove all the horses (<grin>) and this could have been an epic. And as compared to Braveheart, Braveheart is better, though the supporting cast of vikings is better than all Wallace's scotsmen together.",974764800,2,2190,4.819148936170213

Diane Venora (who played Wigand's wife in The Insider), Omar Sharif (from Laurence of Arabia) were underutilised here as they only showed briefly on the screen.  Despite the name, 13th Warrior, the movie simply concentrated on mainly 3 Warriors ie. the Norseman's leader who's brave, wise, & a man with few words; the Arabian (who's intelligent & given the most talking part, to whom the Norsemen called him little brother, played by Anthonio Banderas who's got the top billing), & another Norseman (who was light hearted & rose to the ocassion in the battle).  Otherwise, the battle scenes were superb especially the little adventure to the lair of their adversary, the poking of horses with spikes (reminded me so much of Braveheart).  What separated this movie from Gladiators & Braveheart would mainly its shortage of drama or tragedy (revenge, betrayal, etc. that featured so prominently in Shakespeare's plays or even Greek tragedy).  Overall, a satisfying 2 dimensional movie on a rainy night.

Having read the book, I'd like to have seen the movie delve a bit  more into the Viking lore, to show how these people were not the outright  barbarians that many thought. However, this movie is not meant to be a  documentary. It's goal is to show big men hacking things to pieces with big  swords, and in that it succeeds.
One of the things I liked about this  movie was the main character's reliance on reason and common sense -- the  Viking's don't run screaming when they see the fire dragon, nor are they  overly impressed with the Wendel's supernatural abilities. The barbarians'  philosophy is simple: if it bleeds, it can be slain. This reliance on  real-world observations allows them to triumph where the more mystical  minded and/or cowardly could only cower in fear.
The DVD, however, is  utterly underwhelming with no extras to speak of. It's worth getting if  you're a big fan of the movie, or just love a good swordfest, but don't  expect to get a lot for your money.",968112000,4,1128,4.597989949748744

The leader of the Vikings,  Wolfgar comes accross as the epitome of Norse valour, he exudes strength  and an indomitable spirit whilst at the same time conveying the fatalistic  outlook of the vikings.
I hope we see more of Wolfgar in the future as  we learn't far too little about him and his men in the film.
This film is  just begging to be released with ALL the bits that were cut out put back  in.....the cuts have made this epic into a short action film and this is a  great shame.  The film is also begging for another Saga, one in which I  would have Wolfgar once more lead the warriors.
I give 3 out of 5 for  this film because of the editorial cuts and not any other reason. What is  left is fantastic.",967939200,3,1131,4.214953271028038
1071844,4,6305692688,"At first glance the obvious sub-text for ""The 13th Warrior"" is the epic story of Beowulf. If you are familiar with the story (which may not be a whole heck of a lot of people in modern America) you can figure out which characters represent Grendel and his maternal unit. But halfway through this film things look familiar from another perspective-and then it dawned on me: this film is borrowing heavily from Akira Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai."" Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing. ""The Seven Samurai"" is one of the truly great films and what is happening in ""The 13th Warrior"" is not blatant enough to denounce as ripping off. I can qualify it as an homage. The important thing here is that this is an excuse for you to go rent Kurosawa's epic (hint, hint, hint).

The full name of the title character, played by Antonio Banderas, is Ahmed Ibn Fahdlan Ibn Al Abbas Ibn Rashid Ibn Hamad.  He is puny, not to mention a stranger in a strange land where he can not speak the language (at first), but he's smart and brains can do what brawn can not. The texture of this film comes from the dozen Vikings that make up the rest of the titular company . You will have a hard time figuring out which Viking is which; even if you turn on the closed captioning they never refer to each other by name. I got to the end credits and still could not figure out who was who. I knew thta Vladmiri Kulich was Buliwyf, the 1st Warrior, but it was only recently that I finally found out that my favorite is Herger the Joyous, played by Dennis Storhoi.  Thanks to the IMDB the rest of the merry men are Edgtho the Silent (Daniel Southern), Roneth the Rider (Neil Maffin), Ragnar the Dour (John DeSantis), Helfdane the Fat (Clive Russell), Rethel the Archer (Mischa Hausserman), Haltaf the Boy (Oliver Sveinall), Halga the Wise (Asbjrn ""Bear"" Riis), Skeld the Superstitious (Richard Bremmer), Weath the Musician (Tony Curran), and Hyglak the Quarrelsome (Albie Woodington).  In other words, the Vikings were played most by unknown actors, at least on this side of the Atlantic, so they are not a conglomerate of recognizable faces.

The comparison to ""The Seven Samurai"" probably underscores the biggest weakness in this film, which is the ending, which employs the old Western gambit that entitles the hero (or heroes) to survive overwhelming odds (versus the climatic final battle in the rain in Kurosawa's classic where the goal was to kill every last one of the bandits). When you are dealing with heroes versus villains the effort usually hinges on the quality of your villain. The bad guys in this film are basically a giant horde with the collective intelligence of your vegetable of choice with a tendency to disappear every time they are on the verge of total victory. This is to be expected when you are dealing with what I guess are supposed to be Neanderthals but certainly you would expect better from director McTiernan given his track record. We can only speculate as to what happened between the end of filming and the arrival of this film in theaters two years later.

The location photography is spectacular and there are several above average set pieces that rely on that standard staple of comedy in action films, namely Viking humor.  When I first say this movie the cinematic reference points really bothered me and I originally gave it three stars for a rating while railing about the lack of originality.  But I have to confess that since then this movie has really grown on me and I ended up buying my own copy.  My final verdict would be that ""The 13th Warrior"" is a solid ""B"" movie and at least worth a rental and a bag of popcorn.",967680000,,3644,4.611111111111111

However, I was soon lost in the dark, and nightmarish  world that John McTiernan had placed before my eyes. The action was very  fast paced, and there were plenty of sword fights and beheading. Of course  this film was not made on par with Braveheart, but so what! This film is  not Braveheart! I found this to be more of a Conan movie, which is fine by  me, because those are great films. Antonio Banderas was really well cast as  Ahmed, and the men who played the Norsemen were really great as well. I  heard the name of the king to be Hrothgar. And, if my literature memory  serves me correctly, then this tale could be said to be loosely based upon  the tale of the great Dane Beowulf. Although Beowulf was a good tale it was  boring at times and not an easy read. ""The 13th Warrior"", on the  otherhand was a great movie, and a fine entry to the swordsmen epics. This  is a must see for fans of Conan films, and those who liked Braveheart's  action scenes. ""The 13th Warrior"" can be really gruesome at  times, but for the most part most of the fighting takes place at night so  not alot of blood could be seen. Anyhoo, this is a very fun film to watch,  and I promise that when the Wendol's begin their nocturnal assualts on the  small band of heroes, you will completely forget about Braveheart.....I  did!",966988800,,1477,4.324817518248175

But really,  the only good thing about this movie is the new battle scenes, battles we  haven't seen before by Norsemen on horses wearing bears' heads.  Quite  scary to see a horde like this coming at you!  And a wonderful restraint  from doing fantastic things.  What you see is what really might have  happened.  Good guys get killed as well as bad guys.  The movie is a bit  slow between battle scenes, and the incipient love interest goes nowhere  (nor should it).  Further trimming down might have helped, but the scenery  was so well filmed that it kept your interest (like the first technicolor  Westerns).  Bottom line: a solid three-star movie, worth seeing but not  worth writing home about.",966729600,2,832,4.732394366197183
1071888,1,6305692688,"Having read a couple of the other reviews here before I got onto my own I was AMAZED at how many people actually seem to love this film.  I saw this in the cinema and walked out wandering what ...  I had just seen.  It seemed like a patently ridiculous waste of money which could have been spent on worthier ideas.  Then, reading the reviews, I hear that it is based on an original historical myth/event and I wonder whether this makes up for it being such a bad film...hmmm....
Why do I think the film is bad?  Well, let me count the ways... poor acting, sketchy plot, dull and predictable dialogue, lack of any humour of worthy merit, bad costumes, set design.... I could probably go on but I think you can see my general opinion here already.  Frankly, if I were to be channel surfing and it was on TV, I wouldn't even waste the 90 odd minutes of my life that it would steal from me in my watching it.
However, this returns me to my original quandary... does the fact that it is a 'true story' legitimise the plot, especially if (and I am taking other people's word for it here) it is an accurate interpretation of Michael Crichton's translation, as being something you must accept.  I say no and the reason being that I still don't think it is a good film.  Just because it might make a good book or a good legend doesn't mean that it naturally translates to film.  In fact, that was critical to my dislike because the feeling you had as you watched the film was that it was moving far too fast through far too many events, not allowing any time for us to get involved with any of the characters or to create any kind of emotional bond with them.  I simply didn't care about what was happening.  As someone who has not read the book (I am not a Crichton fan either) this film on its own is no way in the slightest going to make me want to look any further... sorry guys",965433600,3,1873,4.218487394957983
1071889,4,6305692688,"Ibn Fadlan (Antonio Banderas) has made the mistake of falling in love with the wrong woman and is thus sent as ambassador from the medieval court of Baghdad to the furtherest reaches of the known world (along with Omar  Sharif in a cameo role). At a river in Russia they come across a band of  fierce, hardened Vikings, so fierce that even Tartar bandits fear them.  Banderas and Sharif join these Viking warriors during a funeral for their  king. The Norsmen are soon called upon by another Viking kingdom for their  help against an 'ancient enemy'. It's a tale not unlike the old westerns or  even 'The Seven Samurai'. 13 warriors are chosen to go help this distant  kingdom but only 12 warriors can be Norsmen. The 13th warrior is, well, you  know....
When they arrive, they discover that the kingdom is under attack  by a large tribe of ferocious cannibals who dress up like bears. The goal  is to destroy this mysterious tribe and save the kingdom - and that's  pretty much the whole movie. Sure, the plot is simple and the dialogue  spare. But the images are strong with its fire lit chaos and authentic,  heavy weapons. Director John McTiernan did well using the narrative power  of the story to evoke a world where human settlements are fragile but human  solidarity is not.
Based on the Michael Crichton book 'Eaters Of The  Dead' (and the epic poem Beowulf) The 13th Warrior is a good old fashioned  blood and mud war film. A primal tale of stoicism and self-sacrifice. Worth  checking out.",964742400,3,1500,4.638783269961977
1071890,3,6305692688,"This movie was pretty fun to watch but after thinking about it a little bit, it seems they left out a lot of detail. For one thing, they just kind of gloss over the whole part of the main character being kicked out of his  kingdom. Could have used a little bit more info here... Next, the battle  scenes are cool, but why is this group killing the Norse people? Was it  just for their heads? Or was it something more. Got me. Also, what happened  to the prince? After his buddy gets killed, he's gone from the film.  Anyway, if you turn your brain off and enjoy the action, you'll like the  film.

1071891,2,6305692688,"Credit the makers of ""The 13th Warrior"" with at least trying to revive that moribund genre of the late 1950's and 1960's - the truly wretched, utterly inane warring-barbarian epic, wherein hordes of badly  dressed huns, tartars and Vikings smash away at each other with swords and  scimitars to no discernible point or purpose. That such a film is even  attempted in this day and age speaks volumes about either the box-office  bravery (should the folly succeed) or financial foolishness (should it fail  - which it did) of the movie's corporate backers.
Antonio Banderas, who  will assuredly not count this as one of the finest hours of his already  mediocre film career, stars as a foppish, weak-spined Arabian diplomat who  is exiled from Baghdad for an inappropriate dalliance and finds himself an  unwitting and reluctant member (the 13th warrior) of a band of Norsemen who  have been sent out on a rescue mission to help defend a northern village  from attacks by a mysterious malevolent force that comes charging out of  the forest on misty nights. In typical '90's fashion, the filmmakers are  not content to play straight with the subject matter but must imply all  sorts of supernatural elements, presumably to keep skeptical and more  sci-fi oriented modern audiences from hooting the material off the screen.  All those scoffers who deprecated ""The Blair Witch Project"" for  not providing enough of a glimpse of the horrors implied therein get their  comeuppance in this film since the mysterious terror in the woods here  turns out to be literally a bunch of guys dressed in snicker-inducing bear  suits. The screenplay is a confused mess, replete with important characters  that are dropped without any explanation and actions that seem, at times,  entirely lacking in motivation.
About the only new ground this tedious  action film manages to break can be found in Banderas' main character who  emerges as rather a cowardly ninny at the beginning, but who, alas in more  typical fashion, ends up rallying with the other boys to help save the day.  Still, credit the film with trying to smash the mold of pure blue heroic  protagonist at least part of the way. And, perhaps, far from incidentally,  the film affords an opportunity for an aging Omar Sharif to hoist himself  back onto a camel and roam the desert as he rediscovers his ""Lawrence  of Arabia"" roots after all these years. It is a sadly nostalgic  sight.
All of which only goes to show that even the most minor diversion  shines forth in a major way in a film otherwise utterly devoid of all  interest as ""The 13th Warrior.""",964310400,3,2600,4.8764302059496565

1071893,2,6305692688,"I watched the 13th last August with my ex-girl friend, who greaduated as a BA of English Literature. Having studied _Beowulf_ when she was in college, she loved the film. But I was conservative about it.
The most visible  difference between the movie and the novel was the viewpoint. The book was  composed as two parts: ibn Fadlan's 1st person narrative, and the scholar's  voice in footnotes that acts as a 3rd person omniscient (or smartass)  viewer. The movie only follows ibn Fadlan's line. Its viewpoint was closer  to _Beowulf_, many of Crichton's inventions were removed, something as the  Neanderthalian hypothesis.
The movie was designed to be a  testosterone-rich saga. Ibn Fadlan turned to be a he-man in nearly no time.  You can see him display his masculinity in front of the Vikings shortly  after he was kidnapped. You just don't have the idea why and when he became  stronger, and was willing to fight for these babarians. (Hint: watch for  the quickest language lesson in the history of movies.)
To sell the movie  as a superhero film, they omitted some flavorable parts in Crichton's  original. Say the whale part. Why should these Vikings fear a whale? Wasn't  a whale supposed to be a kid's best friend? Didn't you see _Free Willy_  before? But the whale part was one of the most interesting part in the  _Eaters of the Dead_, and came straight from the first paragraph of  _Beowulf_ (whale-road as the ocean). It made the film less tasty to skip  the whale part.
As the movie's title implied, the show was focused on the  13th warrior solely. Throughout the film, the rest 12 of them were  neglected, including Buliwyf, the one created by Crichton as his own  Beowulf. You didn't know much about him, not to mention the others. Some  warriors remained faceless and nameless until they died. Then you learned  about their names postmorten. And after the show, you still didn't have a  clue about how many of them survived. All you could see was Antonio,  Antonio, and Antonio. That's why the movie bugged me most.
Otherwise it  was viewable. And I'll very probably see it again. It was entertaining. But  that was all. It could be better if the film was more complete. I mean the  edition showed in Taiwan was only about 95 minutes long which was 20  minutes shorter than the US edition. It was rated R in the US while PG in  Taiwan. So it was clear that I did not see the whole picture.",963964800,4,2408,4.65083135391924
1071894,3,6305692688,"This movie begins like any true epic should.  An outcast (Banderas) is forced to join a tribe/clan of post Celtic warriors (the Norsemen) who have to prevent a herd of beast-headed men from decapitating and destroying  their homeland.  As an adaptation of Crichton's ""Eaters of the  Dead"" I was prepared for an intense and action oriented tale.
Well,  it was action oriented that's for sure.  In fact, I hesitate to say this  but, I think that the film actually was too burdened with all of the action  sequences that were crammed into the movie.  Of course the film was created  and designed to cater to a younger primarily male audience to sell tickets  and make sure that the theaters were packed (which we know did not happen.)  Unfortunately this catering left too little room to thoroughly develop the  characters.  Banderas started of as the anti-hero thrust into a situation  where he didn't belong.  He was the underdog, the weakling that everyone  roots for (like in the movie ""Lucas"", weird reference, but it  fits...) When all of a sudden his character creates his own weapon  (scimitar) and becomes a ferocious warrior.  I don't buy it.
The battle  scenes and decapitations are very well done, and gory at that.  The film is  worth viewing if you enjoy a good fight and the whole good vs. evil theme.

1071976,5,6305692688,"Call me crazy, but I loved this movie.  Antonio Banderas is Ahmed Ben.........(to long to include the whole name) who is banished from his homeland by the Caliph and (because of his family's position) given the  position as an ambassador to a people in northern Europe.  Where he was  actually assigned is not real well defined, but he winds up in Scandanavia  with the Vikings.  From there he is chosen by a witch to be the 13th of a  group of warriors that will continue north to battle an ancient and unnamed  enemy that has a habit of eating their dead (Based of course on Michael  Criton's ""Eaters of The Dead).
While I have never been a huge  Banderas fan, I think he does a good job of portraying a somewhat meek,  learned ambassador turned warrior.  While his accent may not hit it right  on, I thought it well casted (the charectors playing the North Men were  great).  This the first Banderas movie that I've seen that does not have  some beautiful women to carry him, and I think he did a good job.
It's  been probably two years since I read Eaters of The Dead, and I've probably  forgotten more of it then I remember.  While The 13th Warrior does not go  into great detail of this mysterious people (the Vendor-the eaters of the  dead), I don't think it detracts from the movie, and, in fact, makes every  thing a bit more mysterious.
In short, I really enjoyed this movie and  have watched it more then once.  On the other hand, if you have a DVD  collection, and are not sure whether you want to add it, rent the movie and  decide for yourselves.

The main reason why is because it just keeps you  interested. First, it starts with you wanting to know: Who is this Ahmalad?  Who is this Arab? What's he all about? Then, you want to know, what will  happen to him in the North? And then you get introduced to the Vikings, and  a whole new set of characters is introduced. I think it's great how they  make you interested in the characters.
Sprinkled with light humor (for  the comedians), Filled with gory violence (for the guys), and an  interesting story (for the bookworms), this movie succeeds on every level,  plot, characters, cinematography. It's an entertaining film.
There are  just two warnings before you go see the movie:
This is essentially a  character film. It's about the characters and it's basically centered  around them, so don't see the movie expecting an epic (like The Patriot or  something).
This is an entertaining film. It's not to be taken very  seriously. It's just for kicks. It's not a war movie either, so don't  expect ""Saving Private Ryan: 1354 A.D."" (But there are certain scenes where  it could be classified with that title...)
All in all, this a gory movie  with strong characters and a believable story. I suggest you rent it soon,  and get some popcorn.
And, last but not least, I must give credit to  Michael Crichton (one of my all-time favorite authors) for creating a great  novel on which this movie was based. Enjoy the movie!

1071979,4,6305692688,"This is the film version of Michael Crichton's book EATERS OF THE DEAD.  Told through the eyes of  a young Arab ambassador Ahmahd ibn Fahdalan (Antonio Banderas) this is basically a retelling of one of literature's  classic epics, Beowulf.  Fahadalan is banished from his homeland for  loving the wrong woman. On his journeys he meets up with some Norsemen and  joins their encampment (look for Omar Sheriff in a small part as  Translater.)
When they hear of trouble on one of their lands, the  norsemen consult their oracle who tells them that 13 warriors must confront  the evil (and of course the 13th chosen man must not come from the north).  Thus Fahdalan is coerced into joining their ranks.  What follows is a  thrilling action/adventure Beowulf style as the group tries to battle  against insurmountable odds to defeat the cannabilistic ""Eaters of the  Dead"".
Besides from being well written adventure, it is a  wonderful glimpse into norse culture and mythology.  John McTiernan shows  us a time filled with brave but very human characters where fealty to your  lord and land meant everything -- where fighting for the greater good was  more important than any one man's life.  This is a story of courage and  survival that is at times mesmeririzing to watch.
It's main weakness is  that it was unanble to fit in all the nuances and relationshop complexities  that the book described so well.  Many key definative moments and  characterizations (most notably the cultures of the norsemen and their  relationship with their new arab ""little brother"") are lost or  edited out.  This I believe was not so much the fault of the director but  of the studio who rushed to get the film released.  My other complaint is  with the DVD version of the film, which SHOULD have included an audio  commentary of some kind, and preferably some of the deleted scenes which  would have developed the film more thoroughly.  This it is worth seeing for  fans of epic adventure and mythology.  Here's hoping for a Director's cut  of The 13th Warrior to be released soon.....",963014400,111,2064,4.844380403458214

Not everything is  understood but not all is not understood in the story, theres a certain  mistery in the movie that keeps you coming back to watching it again. Its  one of those movies that get better the more you see it, Antonio Banderas  plays the part of a participative narrator, not the main role, the main  role in the movie belongs to all the 13 warriors, to all the environment  that surrounds us. Could it be better? I don't think so, the story is short  enoigh for the movie lenght, and to strech more here and there or to  explain more this or that would ruin its mistery. I think its a very good  movie and not at all a ""the 7 samurai"" copy, its kinda dumb to  compare all movies ""go to village and rescue habitants"" to the  ""7 samurai"", this story has much more than that to be compared  like that.

1071981,3,6305692688,"You have the feeling watching this movie that the makers had intended to do more with it, but just gave up.  Plots are started and then dropped at the drop of a hat, and they go off and do something else.  Romances,  succesions are mentioned or started, and then they seem to get tired of  that theme, and start running with something different.  What they do go  with isn't so bad per se, but when you imagine how much better it could  have been, you start to feel cheated for what you did get.
  The  beginning of the movie redefined the term slow for me, taking fifteen or  twenty minutes for anything to really happen.  Actually, I wish they had  done more with the way that Antonio Banderas' character is chosen for this  mission.  To my mind, there was hardly enough conflict there.  What man in  his right mind would let himself be dragged along on this adventure when he  had no stake in what was happening without putting up more of a fight?
  To be fair though, the fights themselves were impressive, and I thought for  the majority that they were well handled.  The end fight was a bit  ridiculous though, as no explanation was really given as to why the men  would retreat just because their leader was killed.  They still outnumbered  the Vikings by probably as much as 3 to 1 or so, so that didn't quite make  sense to me.
  All in all, I'd say this movie is worth seeing at least  once, either on a rental, or waiting for it to come out on HBO.  Judge for  yourself.",961977600,,1481,4.311355311355311

This movie is just a big adventure, nothing more nothing less. It has so many flaws and  at the same times there are many little details that haven't been missed. I  was waiting for Banderas to start speaking with the vikings despite the  fact that he didn't know their language four scenes before, but we are  shown how he learns it. I was waiting for him to go into a battle  armorless, but we are shown moment before it how he's given an armor.
Then the details that you will definitely miss without some basic  knowledge in history and Scnadinavian mythology. Those little things thrown  after the duel, the statue of the little fat lady left behind by the  `demons', the Valhalla what they're all speaking about. At the same time,  although, Banderas as an islamite only prays once in the movie, he never  shaves but is always clean-shaven, despite the furious fighting he gets  only some (very) minor wounds.
There are many funny scenes about the  differences between different cultures and a lot of killing, but that's the  idea of it. Banderas plays the way he always does and the rest of the gang  is surprising at times. Battles are pretty spectacular and the story goes  the same path as ""Indiana Jones"", ""Tombrider"" and all the usual heroic  stories go. Music is a little annoying.
All in all I can suggest it to  only those who enjoy fantasy in all its forms and surely not to a  historian, cause he'll definitely have a hart failure.",959990400,,1581,4.546099290780142
1072071,4,6305692688,"Okay, first off I always felt that Antonio is completely overrated.  I asked for an action film, my wife provided Antonio.  Needless to say, I was not pleased.  Yet, as I watched the film, I was impressed.  Large portions  of the film are unrealistic, but what action film hasn't been (including  Braveheart).  The fact is you get considerable action with a few ""men  of honor who won't give up"" scenes that always get the blood pumping.  A little romance has been included to keep you significant other involved  (granted it's dark ages style, but it's something)  For the film nuts,  there are some great scenes to enjoy.  One of my favorites is the scene of  Ahmahd ibn Fahdalan learning the language of the Norsemen he travelled  with.  That said, one of the weaknesses of the film is the lack of depth in  the plot.  There are many subplots that were just dropped to the side  without much closure leaving the movie feeling less than complete.  In  addtion, I would have liked to know a little more of the supporting cast.  Quite a few of the actors who portrayed the other warriors did alot with  very few scenes to work with.  Yet, in spite of a few misgivings, I must  encourage you to see this movie.  It's fluff, but it makes for a nice night  curled up on the couch.  Enjoy.",959817600,,1285,4.469565217391304
1072072,3,6305692688,"This is a very interesting movie. It is kind of religious, in the part at the end when everyone is praying to Allah. It is full of gore, but it is a really dark movie, full of darkness. I enjoy the beginning where he is in  Arabia, and he goes and runs away from the Tartars. I don't think that is  the best combo for a movie- Arabians and Vikings. I enjoy also when Ahmed  teaches the Vikings his skills from before, with his swords and such.  Finally, I like the battles probably the best, because there are a lot of  them, and they often last for long, and they all happen in kind of the same  sequence, where first mist drops over the villiage, then an injured child  comes out of the mist, then torches appear, then the battle begins.

1072075,4,6305692688,"While not quite of the epic proportions that it aspires to be, ""The 13th Warrior"" is nevertheless a rousing, entertaining action adventure, spiced with well orchestrated battles and director John McTiernan's (Die Hard, The Hunt for Red October) unique view of how an  action film works.  The film follows the adventures of Ahmed (Antonio  Banderas), an exiled 8th century Arabian ambassador.  Banished from his  homeland for having an affair with a powerful rich man's wife, Ahmed is  sent to the northern lands, to act as an ambassador to the barbarians who  dwell there.  Shortly after he arrives at his new ""home"", Ahmed  is selected by an aged oracle to accompany 12 seasoned veterans, led by  Buliwyf, to destroy the evil Wendol, an ancient evil threatening the lands  of King Hrothgar.  Ahmed, by no means a man of action, eventually finds his  own identity as he and the 12 defend Hrothgar's realm against the evil  enemy and, eventually, seek out and destroy them in their lair.  This is  one of Antonio Banderas' finer roles: though the part doesn't demand a lot  of acting talent, Banderas seems comfortable in the role, and even manages  to escape the ""hunk"" persona he created for himself in  ""Desperado"" and ""The Mask of Zorro"".  Aside from  Banderas, the film is made up of Swedish character actors, with the  exceptions of Diane Venora and Omar Sharif (always a delight to see) in  small supporting roles.  While ""The 13th Warrior"" doesn't  quite hit the ""epic"" mark, in terms of either its scope or the  presentation of its numerous battles, it is still one of the better films  of this genre to have come out in quite some time.  One interesting aspect  of the film, based upon Michael Crichton's ""Eaters of the Dead"",  is the way in which it deconstructs both the Beowulf legend and the  conventions of the fantasy adventure genre.  ""The 13th Warrior""  is not, contrary to initial appearances, a fantasy film, though some clues  left earlier in the film report it to be: tales of a great dragon, the  assumption that the Wendols are demons, etc.  Once all is revealed, the  Wendol are simply a hostile, cannibalistic tribe of barbarians who take to  the shadows.  While the idea of the Beowulf legend is hardly touched on in  the film at all, it is still an interesting subtext for those familiar with  the legend or with Crichton's novel...The battle scenes stand next to McTiernan's other fine  action sequences: well staged, complex, and a bit confusing on a first  viewing (all of McTiernan's films deserve at least a second look).  The  bombastic score is sweeping, just the right tone for a film of this sort,  and the art direction and cinematography are stunning.  It may not be  a masterpiece, but considering its flawed history ""The 13th  Warrior"" is still one of the finest ""sword & sorcery""  type pictures to hit the screen in quite some time.",958521600,,2873,4.786885245901639

I had no ideal what this  movie was going to be about when I rented it, the only thing that I knew  was that the sexy Antonio Banderas was going to be in it.  So having no  expectations for the movie and wanting to see Antonio is a big influence on  why I enjoyed the movie as much as I did.
  It started off very  interesting with 12, big, strong, norsmen warriors volunteering to help a  kingdom in need and a reluctant Antonio becoming the 13th member of their  party.  So they head out on their mission and start to encounter some  pretty unbelieaveable, and frightening things about their enemy.

The  film is increadibly accurate, mixed with a little mytholigy in the form of  perhistoric men, who are Cannibals that ravage a local king's lands.  Beautiful movie, lovely local.

1072153,4,6305692688,"I had the pleasure of catching this movie immediately after watching Akiro Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai"" (familiar to many Americans in its remake, ""The Magnificent Seven"").  The parallels between the two  cannot be overstated.
In ""The 13th Warrior,""  12 Vikings and  an Arab envoy (Antonio Banderas) are recruited to aid another Norse tribes  struggle against a horrible foe, the ""eaters of the dead.""  As in  ""Samurai,""  a handful of fine warriors are charged with  protecting a hapless village from an overwhelming foe, relying almost  entirely on individual bravery and cunning.
While the story is fairly  straightforward, it shines in the way it portrays the cultural differences  between Arab and Norseman without demeaning either.  The combat is bloody  but not excessively so, the camera does not dwell on gore.  The  cinematography is terrific, portraying the muddy hues of the far North's  landscape in an appropriately somber fashion.
One could pick away at a  number of little inaccuracies (""Beowulf"" written in the original  Arabic?) but why bother?  This is a great action movie which is accurate in  a more significant fashion than most Hollywood movies---there are no sex  scenes.  Period.

1072155,5,6305692688,"I am a reasonably conservative old-man film lover, who has little time for the buckets of gore action genre, and often complain, with senile raputure, about how superficial plot development and fast-cut editing have created a  generation of impatient illiterates who couldn't read a whole classic book  -- how many of you have actually read Ivanhoe? -- if their lives depended  on it.
I should have hated this movie.
But I loved it. Why? One of the  earlier reviewers ""got it"". This movie is all about mood and  evocation of place and emotion. It is much much better than Crichton's  ""Eaters of the Dead"" on which it is based, a book which is often  panned as a pale reconstruction of the Beowulf saga. The movie  actually IS  successful in that it captures the spirit, the savagery, the action and the  intention of the Beowulf legend. THAT is the point!  Do regius professors  of medieval English literature at Harvard give Beowulf only one star  because it has plot gaps, character anomalies, or even a fundamental  contradiction in sliding back and forth between heathen and christian  worldviews? Of course not.
People who slam this movie for unexplained  connections, fast jumps, an unconventional balance between the characters  absolutely do not get it. This is an incredibly well crafted film, a subtle  film, and probably the best approximation of the structure, style, and  spirit of a Norse saga ever attempted. Naybe Chrichton and McTiernan  intended that, and simply shot over the head of the teeny-bopper audience.  I'll give them credit for having tried for that structure and effect.  Whatever - this is a better film than most of you realize. Go out and buy  Haney's new translation of Beowulf, and you will see the point.",957398400,4,1740,4.903780068728523

Antonion is always value for  money, and the cast of relative unknowns is surprisingly compelling.  Set-pieces are nicely executed and there is some genuine menace in a few  scenes.

The juxtaposition of two wildly different cultures was interesting--and provided nuances you  rarely see in your normal hack and slash movie. Banderas was effective as  an Arab poet-turned-warrior who earns the respect of his Viking cohorts  first when he learns their language by sheer observation. If you're  expecting highly intense psychological portrayals of the characters, and  great witty dialogue, you WILL be disappointed!  But that's not what this  movie is about--I think every movie should be honored in the spirit it was  intended.  This is a movie about MOOD--a creepy, dank mood, filled with  great atmospheric cinematography and good battle scenes with fairly  inexplicable bad guys.  I like how there's silences in this film, as well  as plenty of unexplained things. (after all, the protagonists don't know  what the heck is going on either!)Citizen Kane it is not, but this is a  highly satisfying piece of entertainment--to use a food metaphor, not fine  cuisine but not junk food, either.

The much-maligned failure to resolve the subplots is a big key.  It gave the film a jerky feel, kept characters from developing, and  generally left me feeling let down at the end of the film.

This is the problem.
""The 13th Warrior"" gives the very  strong impression of being a film that has been edited nearly to death, and  given the careful attention that is given to the remaining portions, I  strongly suspect that the director had little to do with the butchering.  There are several subplots which are introduced and never resolved.  Allusions are made to pre-christian Nordic culture and religion, but these  are unsatisfactorily developed. When the film ended at approximately one  hour and forty minutes, I watched the rolling credits with a growing sense  of disappointment. This film could and SHOULD have been much longer, giving  time to flesh out the rich history and culture which served as the film's  setting. The casting and direction are excellent, and could easily sustain  audience attention for another hour and half (or more).
I do recommend  that the film be viewed, but until a director's cut (hopefully one replete  with some obviously missing scenes) is released, I would not recommend  actually purchasing it.",952819200,19,1272,5.227722772277228
1072332,4,6305692688,"It was like the stealth movie.  Antonio Banderas (Zorro) starring in a movie based on a Michael Crichton (Jurassic Park) book and  . . . nothing.  Most people never even heard of this film that inexplicably slid right  through the box office with barely a whimper.  But they missed a good  one.
The 13th Warrior is loosely based on the Crichton novel Eaters of  the Dead.  Banderas plays an Arab of high birth who is banished from his  people for falling in love with the wrong woman.  He is sent as an  ambassador to the barbaric people of the North where he meets up with a  dangerous, yet fairly affable group of Vikings.
The plot gains speed when  a child seeks out the leader of the Vikings to help defend a different  Viking kingdom from an evil force.  When an oracle determines that 13  warriors must go to combat the evil, Banderas is drafted because the 13th  warrior must not be a northman.  The thirteen ""volunteers"" head  north to combat the evil force  that decapitates and eats its  victims.
Make no mistake, this is a violent, bloody movie.  But in the  best tradition of classic fantasy, it is engaging and exhilarating.  The  battle scenes seemed to be filmed from the midst of the action, and the  blows appear frighteningly real.  The sword play is direct and brutal.  This movie aims for a dark, serious tone and largely achieves it.
Though the action scenes are terrific, the most appealing part of this  film is the Viking characters.  Though many of the roles are filled by  unknown talent, the performances are right on.  The Vikings are violently  repulsive, yet decidedly brave, noble, and loyal.  They, like the movie,  are decidedly smarter and more subtle than they would initially appear.  Banderas' Arab character goes from outsider to warrior as he slowly adopts  the noble courage of his Viking companions.
I'm sure most critics  dismissed this film as meaningless violence.  But it's much more than that  if you take the time to look.",952214400,26,1969,4.6932153392330385

The only flaw is  the fact that everyone in the movie is supposed to be speaking in, what,  swedish or something I guess, but instead of subtitling it, they go the  easy way and let you appear to be understanding it in english.  If it  sounds weird, you'll see when you watch this flick.  One of the things I  liked, and I was a little surprised after having seen many epic medieval  pieces where the main character is a lesser warrior than his companions, is  that it's not up to Banderas to battle the vicious Head Warrior.  Rather,  this story is told more from Banderas' point of view as a novice soldier.  One thing I don't understand, though, having never read the book...why is  Banderas in his obvious lack of experience deemed a warrior?

To start off, the central character played by Banderas is not the main hero of the story.  I was actually slightly disappointed by his role in the escape from the cave, someone else should've led the command. The hero is the chief Viking, just as it should be.
A lot of details, often subtle enough to be skipped by the subplot researching Hollywood barons but to be found by a keen viewer, illustrate the culture of the age. The code of honor, the strength and bravery, the tradition and the superstitions - all of it needs to be taken as a whole.
Whoever found a love interest in there? Mutual curiosity and search of comfort in the face of fear, nothing more. And the dishonorable prince disappeared from the scene like he must, to save his life, after integrity of the warriors beat his intrigue. All in the spirit of time, don't try to see more than there is.

1072379,4,6305692688,"Hollywood takes another chop at making a Viking epic. Will the 13th Warrior be the ""Braveheart"" of Viking epics?
The 13th Warrior chronicles the journey of an outcast Moor (Antonio Banderas) who becomes  involved in a mission to save a Viking village from the onslaughts of some  bloody thirsty cannibals. Originally entitled ""Eaters of the  Dead"" and adapted from the Michael Crichton novel, this film has taken  one and a half years to get to our local multiplex. Rumors of a $150  million plus budget and numerous scenes being reshot, I was beginning to  wonder if this film would ever surface. Director John McTiernan was  extremely upset with the film and the studio pulling the plug pre-emptly.  There are reports that the studio pulled the plug then asked the angered  director to reshoot the ending and various fight scenes. Let's just say  this film was a behind the scenes mess.
What's so incredibly amazing is  this film overcomes the plagued behind the scenes mess. The sweeping Viking  mists, the longboat overcoming thirty foot waves, blood thirsty battle, and  scenic highlands are just some of the mystique that have enchanted our  minds on the views of Viking lore. What's really rich and never been done  in Hollywood is the thought of an outsider entering this mystical world and  letting us see it through his eyes. Banderas' Muslim outsider is kind,  sensitive and passionate until he becomes embroiled in the honor of being a  man of the North. He is among very few Hollywood heroes who are disturbed  by the blood and gore associated with Viking civilization. But when he  finds that the ""unnamed"" evil is only a man, his anger engulfs  him and he begins to see a new vision of what man is. This is an epic in  the greatest sense of the word.
The only ever evident flaw in this film  is the ending itself. Why is it so short? Why is the climax not on a major  scale? I know the symbolism associated with Vikings dying in battle and why  didn't they take that to next level? The ending is only about 3 minutes  when we should have been in the 10-20 minute range. On a positive note,  this is the first Hollywood venture I have ever seen that takes Vikings  seriously and I have wanted to see something in that nature all my life. I  just hope because of all its problems they don't stop making Viking films.  Previous Viking films have been on less than 10 million dollar budgets and  looked like men dueling in woolen overalls. Anybody out there remember  ""Lee Majors"" in ""The Vikings"" or ""Tim  Robbins"" in the funny ""Erik the Viking""? Well these were  about the only Viking staples until ""The 13th Warrior"". So go out  and see this epic but when its done think what it would have been like if  the final war scenes were 10 minutes longer. I hope Hollywood can hear me.",951091200,6,2792,4.580971659919029

On his journeys he meets up with an  encampment of Norsemen who's King has just died. Fahadalan (Banderas) is  swept into becoming the 13th man of a group burdened with having to travel  back to their homeland to confront an evil threat that's bound in such  superstition they're forbidden to speak its name.

1072603,5,6305692688,"Don't believe all the critics, The 13th Warrior, while not a perfect film, provides a level of satisfaction that I hadn't exeperienced in the movies in a long long time.
I had read the book a couple of year's ago, and when  I heard that a movie was being made, I approached it with a mixture of hope  and trepidation.  I had in my mind an idea of what live action version of  Eaters of the Dead (The original title of the book) should look like and  was afraid that it would get mangled by the director.
My fears were put  to rest however, the film follows the book very closely, perhaps the  involvement of Micheal Crichton in directing had something to do with it.  The sets in this film a absolutely phenomenal, they are beautiful, awe  inspiring and authentic.  It really looked like Scandinavia 1200 years  ago.
Antonio Banderas, if you're willing to buy the idea of him playing  an Arab, turns in a solid performance.  The actors portraying Vikings do a  good job also, with the right mixture of toughness and humour.  The battle  scenes in this film were incredible, and make the film worth watching more  than once.
I agree with the other reviewer that some intersting plot  elements that could have been followed, were not.  But that is about the  only criticism that I have of this movie.  This one is definitely a  keeper.
PS:  The soundtrack of this movie was so good that I bought it,  Amazon.com may have have it, check it out, you'll love it.",948672000,,1457,4.473282442748092
1072604,4,6305692688,This was an excellent movie!  In the same style as Brave Heart but not as long.  I hope that other people don't expect too much from it though.  Holes in the plot must be forgiven in order to get a good feeling out of  the film as a whole.  The characters are powerful and the message of past  culters can still be heard.  The action draws you into the story and then  you have to read the book to get the rest.  A must see if you are a person  who reads the book afterwards.,948585600,2,475,3.905263157894737
1072605,5,6305692688,"This movie portrays the story of Beowulf better than anything short of the old english version.  The stereo-type of the Vikings is truly shattered in this story.  The cunning and all-out magnificence of these characters show  Vikings to be flawless warriors.  The Vikings seem to be more of a cross  between the galant Knights of the Round Table and the spiritual Native  Americans.  But even beyond both, they know the lands science, the Gods  hope, and the idea of showing others what to believe, to make them  stronger.  Without telling you the story, I have to say, I have never seen  a movie I wish had been the length of a weeklong documentary other than  Braveheart.",948585600,,673,4.706896551724138
1072606,5,6305692688,"I must admit, there were a few flaws with this realistic interpretation of Beowulf - most notably, the abridging of some subploting and character developement for the sake of brevity - but it didn't matter. These elements  are not missing from the story; rather, the film's editing makes them  subtle. It's left to the imagination. Try to think of the last time a  hollywood movie did that - and this is an action film!
The best aspects  of it were in the interaction between the characters - the clash of  cultures between Arab and Viking is just terrific - and the developement of  the Beowulf character, Buliwyf. The character is extremely dynamic as he is  viewed from the Arab's eyes, moving from an intimidating barbarian to a  hero the Arab both admires and even reveres. The end is incredibly moving.",948499200,2,808,4.7214285714285715
1072607,4,6305692688,"Having not read the book on which this film is based, I can't adequately review the translation from written word to the screen.  However from what I saw it seems that this movie was the victim of near fatal editing.  Many  events in the story, (ie: the rebellious prince in the village, ahamed's  love affair with the girl in the village, ect.), are never quite filled  out.  In many instances I felt that there should have been a major effect  on the story that these numerous events should have had. However they are  just left there, untouched for the most part by the movie.  The vacume  created by the lack of sudstantial plot is filled by numerous, impressive  battle scenes.  These are slightly ""Brave Heart"" remeniscent, and  provide enjoyment to a certain extent.  However swords, mythology, blood,  and testosterone does not an epic film create.  The lack of a good plot  does hurt this movie, but doesn't ultimately kill it.  The battle scenes  are fun to watch, and the mythology of the Norse culture is interesting  enough.  This alone would make it worth buying to fans of the action  genere.  On the other hand, if you prefer a steady mix of action and  in-depth story it might be best to avoid this title.",948412800,,1222,4.629107981220657
1072608,5,6305692688,"I think this was Antonio's best movie yet.  It is packed full of suspense and non-stop action.  It has it's gory moments, but hey, what action movie doesn't.  This movie is set back in time to the Viking era, but with a  twist added by Antonio, who is from the Middle East.  Antonio is asked to  be the 13th Warrior, and they go to the north and help out their family  against an unknown enemy.  Considering some of the latest movies that have  just been released I would say this is a 10.  It is definitly a one time  must see.",948326400,5,528,4.128712871287129
1072609,5,6305692688,"I originally heard pretty bad stuff about this movie -- Roger Ebert, for instance, said it was exciting yet plotless.  After renting and seeing this the other night (which incidentally, prompted me to buy it) I have to  disagree heartily.
What does the movie have?  First, it has good  character development.  Most of the characters that matter (Buliwyf, Ahmed,  etc.) are shown in detail and have growth and development.  It is very well  acted for the kind of movie it is.  It is very interesting for it's  portrayal of the Germanic heroic culture, and the values that infused it.  I think this is where many critics fail to see the shine in the movie.  Because they are unable to get themselves out of their modern cultural  frame of reference, the actions of the characters sometimes seem  unmotivated and the plot seems to suffer.  As a student of ancient heroic  societies and their literature, I understood right away what was going on  with the characters.
For some flaws with the movie, some of the more  interesting potential plot lines were alluded to but not followed through  with.  Banderas' romance, the intrigue with the son of the king, the  possibility of the wendol as Neanderthals, as hinted in the book -- all  would have made the movie *more* interesting than it already is, and would  have, perhaps, given it a plot that had a little more relevance to modern  audiences.",948326400,87,1393,4.756302521008403
1072610,4,6305692688,This is a great movie. The details of the Viking culture is exremly accurrate from their costums to their religious beliefs. Great acting. Inspires courage and bravary. Battle sences were full of action. Only  problem with the film is if you miss any part of it you will be lost for  the rest of the film.,948326400,,305,4.428571428571429
1072734,4,6305692688,"All the greatest vikings came from Iceland and some came from Norway. We have to read stories of vikings in school, so Icelanders are the best people to judge a Viking story. Michael Crichton has done a good job making  the 13th Warrior... some people say that the plot is not deep enough... it  takes about 500 pages to tell a good story... I would love to see a movies  which will be about 10 hours long... I have seen lots of viking films, and  this is the best I've seen!
++ 13th Warrior gets 4 stars... I would have  wanted to have some extras on the DVD disc... like a commentary or deleted  scenes... it would be perfect that way ++",948326400,3,639,4.19672131147541
1072735,4,6305692688,"I really liked Die Hard, which McTiernan also directed, so I expected this to be somewhat better than a typical action movie.  It is a technically impressive film, with beautifully constructed battle sequences and very  high production values throughout.  The plot is either mythic or terribly  formulaic, depending on how much innovation one expects from a movie about  a bunch of Vikings.
I felt that the film's greatest weakness was the  sketchiness of the Vikings' enemy.  McTiernan's films have included  interesting, engaging villains, most notably Alan Rickman's character in  Die Hard, so I though he could have done more to make the bad guys in this  movie a bit 3-dimensional, or at least more threatening.
My biggest  complaint with the final product, however, is the lack of a director's  commentary.  This feature, which is quickly becoming standard on DVD's,  would have been a particularly useful complement to such a technically  complex film, and could have greatly increased its replay value.",948240000,,1010,5.225

I was expecting a long and moving story like in Braveheart,  but all we got was a para-normal episode with Beowulf doing some mercenary  work for a besieged village by some mountain dwelling barbarian  tribe.
Oh, don't get me wrong, the film had an interesting wardrobe and  good battle scenes along with some distinguishable characters, but lacked  the ""What for?"" that Braveheart did.",948240000,,540,5.160919540229885

I think Banderas gives a great performance  and every Viking plays out their roles fittingly - but it felt I was  wandering aimlessly from one battle to another.
The DVD transfer is  excellent, and the sound quality is great too, but the disc offers no  extras, and certainly doesn't pump life into such a disappointing film.",948153600,5,503,4.670454545454546

1072743,2,6305692688,"Finally, a year after it was finished, we can see John McTiernan's long-awaited ""The 13th Warrior."" But alas, it's nothing but a cheap gore fest. It's one of those movies where the action and special  effects were payed more attention to than the screenplay. In fact, it feels  like it was speed-written with McTiernan or one of the producers saying  ""more action scenes! More action scenes!"" Yet, it could have been  fascinating considering it's based on Michael Crichton's book, ""Eaters  Of The Dead,"" which was inspired by the poem, ""Beowulf"" and  the true story of Ibn Fadahland. But ""The 13th Warrior"" falls in  the trap of being dumb, and by not having a smart story and only action  scenes, making us lose interest. There's a difference between an action  movie that has lots of action, but also a smart story that keeps us  watching and one that only throws in lots of cash, but not lots of thought  and we just think of it as dumb. I do want to point out that the  cinematography is rich, the score by Jerry Goldsmith is exhilarating but  sounds too much like his previous score for ""The Mummy."" What we  end up with here is a film that chokes in its own blood-baths. In fact, I  was getting bored of so much gore because there wasn't an interesting  story. The characters are plain like the plot, the whole screenplay itself  needs more detail, more intrigue and medieval lore. This looks like a cross  between ""Braveheart"" and ""Conan The Barbarian"" (which  is a much, much better movie). There's too much that's never explained  here. Like the fact that one of the bodies disappears in some mystic way,  but in the end, the villains turn out to be simple cave dwelers gone mad,  and if they are cave-dwelers and nothing more, how could they devise such  complex, well-planned attacks on the viking heroes? It makes no sense. I  would rather ""Conan The Barbarian,"" made with less money, ten  times over this, at least that was a real mythecal adventure. ""The  13th Warrior"" promises, but doesn't deliver.",946857600,3,2014,4.666666666666667
