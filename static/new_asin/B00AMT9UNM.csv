5455575,5,B00AMT9UNM,"As a pastry chef it look like I was just back to school, Anne is real great in explaining how to decorate a cake with butter cream, her technique is nice, clean and
any one that doesn't know anything about decorating cake makes the job real easy; its obvious that each one of us has different technics but Anne made it very easy with good tips and a very nice and clean enviroment, the reason why I bought this CD to my sous chef as a gift.
Highly recommend you to give it a try.",1370390400,,479,4.052631578947368
5455576,5,B00AMT9UNM,This DVD is very informative and shows you exactly how to fill and square off a round and square cakes. It really helped me to get a better understanding of the process. especially for the square cakes to get perfect edges.,1366243200,,223,4.463414634146342
5455577,4,B00AMT9UNM,nice. something to learn from. very neat. hope more videos of flower techniques can be on video. would highly recommend.,1364774400,,120,5.05
5455578,5,B00AMT9UNM,"Hi Anne,

I have been completely inspired by you and your team. Your cake decorating techniques takes it to another level.
Thank you.",1364774400,,133,4.782608695652174
5455579,5,B00AMT9UNM,"I love Anne's cakes and although I have a bake shop, it's always useful to see how the real pros do it.  I've already utilized some of her techniques very successfully and am thrilled.  You can see the difference in my cakes already.",1363737600,,233,4.395348837209302
5455580,1,B00AMT9UNM,"It was super slow, I  suppose what people are calling ""step by step,"" but it did not teach me anything I didn't already know, and she only teaches one method-her method. No real variations. In any case, it should not take that long to perfectly ice a cake unless you have no cake decorating skill set whatsoever. If bakeries took that long, how would they be able to make hundreds of orders a week? Definitely not worth the money. I saw a video like this online for free.",1361923200,,471,4.3522727272727275
5455581,3,B00AMT9UNM,"I did enjoyed the video and learned some new things however, some of the techniques expressed on the video have already been on the web and YouTube for quite a while. I really do feel that it was just adding one or two little things extra to pre-existing techniques to make it seem ""unique"". The freezer will be your best friend for sure but what will happen with all those hobby or home bakers that don't have the freezer space?? When she inserted wires into the cake, I could hear cake decorators around the world gasp in horror, lol! Like I said, I enjoyed the video but I think that Sharon Zambito's ""Art of Buttercream"" is much more detailed and buttercream problem solving than this video.",1359676800,2,695,4.523809523809524
5455582,5,B00AMT9UNM,"I recently purchased cake 101&102, and they are exceptionally great and informative! Anne Heap is a great teacher- clear and precise, providing the detailed information that makes the difference between a polished, perfect cake and one that is merely okay. Her easy ""fix it"" tips for fondant flaws are fantastic, and very generous of her to share...so much great information - I loved them both!",1358899200,,395,5.092307692307692

8554333,5,B00AMT9UNM,I love these two discs (101 & 102). Anne Heap is a great teacher. I have seen many lessons on covering cakes and still got some new and very useful/helpful information from these that I haven't seen before.
