8353873,5,B002748SRE,"Clear explanation of the function and methods of playing backup on the 5-string banjo.  Thoroughly detailed, always manageable, wonderfully effective coaching on how to begin developing the skills necessary for playing with others and finding the pathways to more complete backup capability.  I avoided the Murphy Method at first because I needed the tablature.  Then I gave it a try and found out that I don't.  Hooray for the Murphy Method!",1395705600,2,442,5.183098591549296
