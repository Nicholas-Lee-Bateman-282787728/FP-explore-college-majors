All of which are very boring and uninteresting to anyone not named Jacqueline Du...ect.",1461196800,,252,4.382978723404255
7855682,4,6303874541,"I don't know what possessed 2 different companies to release 2 titles of Jackie biographies simultaneously. Nonetheless being a Jackie fan, I purchased them both. With hindsight it would probably have been better to have stuck with just the other release, ""Jacqueline du Pre In Portrait"" (on BBC/Opus Arte). Not that this present documentary is worse in any way. Both films were shot by Christoper Nupen. And that's exactly what makes this release from EMI less desirable. Seeing how Christopher Nupen is supervising the release of all his documentaries under the BBC/Opus Arte label, it would have been better to wait for the release of this documentary under his imprimatur. Especially so when you consider the generous supplements included with the current Opus Arte release (155mins) and the total lack of extras on this one by EMI (56mins). In either case the restoration and remastering of the vintage material is exemplary. It helped that they were all shot on film and not video.

For the completist, Christopher Nupen shot 6 films featuring Jacqueline du Pre.
Jacqueline
Jacqueline du Pre and the Elgar Cello Concerto
Remembering Jacqueline du Pre
The Trout
The Ghost
Who was Jaqueline du Pre?

Both The Elgar Cello Concerto and The Ghost have been released as part of Opus Arte's ""Jacqueline du Pre In Portrait"".
Remembering Jacqueline du Pre is the sole feature in this present EMI release. The one fans are waiting impatiently for is the all-star recording of the Trout quintet. Hopefully Opus Arte will pair that with another du Pre documentary to make another double-bill feature. So if you're interested in getting this documentary, perhaps it'll be wiser to wait till it re-emerges under the BBC/Opus Arte label.

Update (Aug 2005): BBC/Opus Arte has released the Trout Quintet as part of a Franz Schubert double-bill DVD. It contains the 55min long documentary, ""The Trout,"" which includes the rehearsals and complete live recording of Schubert's Trout Quintet made in 1969 with Itzhak Perlman, Pinchas Zuckerman, Jacqueline du Pre, Zubin Mehta and Daniel Barenboim at London's Queen Elizabeth Hall. It comes together with Nupen's 80min long, award-winning, 1994 documentary on the life and music of Franz Schubert, titled ""The Greatest Love and The Greatest Sorrow.""",1112572800,47,2284,5.184281842818428
7855683,5,6303874541,"We have two DVDs on this world famous English cellist available in Amazon, and even though they have much in common, each supplements the other. In case you want to have just one only and unless you prefer a fuller account of her musical upbringing or the details of the wake of her performing career, you should probably go by this one.

We have more music here in the sense that the excerpts are longer and often of better quality (e.g. in colour), giving us a fuller flavour of her playing and of the music. Her duets with her teacher are much longer and are as such much more interesting. More clips like ""The Trout"" are in colour and the sound are beautiful. Other than the cello, Du Pre also played a movement of Kuhlau Sonatina on the piano.

Many of the clips were not intended for commercial purposes.  They were taken with much intimacy, affording us a much fuller picture of great performers off the stage. The running time might be short but they have offered the best of the musician Du Pre. It is well worth your time & investment.",1111622400,5,1045,4.432291666666667
7855684,5,6303874541,"It took me 4 months to get this VHS. I had never heard of Jacqueline du Pre until the movie. It was hard to understand such talent cut short at 28 years old with MS. Having just watched the Jerry Louis Telethon and having a form of MS myself (Myasthenia Gravis) which fortunatly is under control - I simply had to watch this remarkable ""EMI Classic"" again. I have to agree with other comments that it was to short - but remarkable non the less. Probably the greatest Cellist of the century or at any time it is a marvelous tribute. Needless to say I have the book and several CD's. I wish there was more to see.",1062547200,7,611,4.186440677966102
7855685,4,6303874541,"Having just recently gotten hooked on Jackie, her music and her life, I found this video to be an amazing time capsule of some of her performances.  My only complaint is that we aren't able to see complete performances of the pieces.  Another reviewer mentioned the odd use of freeze frames, which I also found oddly disturbing.  But the video is definitely worth it, if only to see her playing Iztak Stern's violin like a cello backstage and to see her working out a piece with William Pleeth.  The footage of her and Barenboim is also outstanding, especially when we get to hear Jackie play a Clementi piece on the piano, Daniel at her side.  The other complaint I have is that overall it's too short!  I'd love to see more of Jackie and hear more interviews with her.",1037145600,15,770,4.503597122302159
7855686,5,6303874541,"I have been an admirer of Jackie's ever since I heard her play her famous rendition of Elgar's Cello Concerto, and I believe that this movie is a real credit to her memory. It has wonderful, loving interviews from Bill Pleeth, her cello teacher, as well as Sir John Barbirolli (who conducted her first recording of Elgar), and interviews from Jackie herself, telling about her early cello experiences and studies with Bill Pleeth. The movie features clips of Jackie playing the Brahms Sonata in F Major, the Beethoen Sonata in A, Offenbach duets with Pleeth, The Elgar Concerto, Schubert's Trout Quintet with husband Daniel Barenboim, Itzhak Perlman and others, Beethoven's Ghost Trio, and short songs written for her by her mother Iris. It is a beautifully done and affectionate memory to, in many opinions, the greatest cellist of her generation. I am a cellist myself, so  I know music pretty well, but I know that someone with limited or no musical knowledge will get a lot out of this movie, because it is done with a tenderness that can get through to all people.",1001635200,21,1069,4.809782608695652
7855687,5,6303874541,"I did want to see this so much. And today at last I became to see this. Oh! I became to know Jackie is so beautiful and her music is also beautiful again.  In the some part of this I was dispressed a little,because that is  similar to the film,<<Jacqueline>> by Christopher Nupen. But it  doesn't matter.  I love this film,<<Remembering Jacqueline Du  Pre>> so much!!!!!!!",927072000,4,372,4.575757575757576
7855688,2,6303874541,"As a classical musician and lover of the cello, I first became aware of Jacqueline Du Pre as a college student. Upon hearing a recording of the Haydn Cello Concerto in C by Du Pre I was astonished and transfixed, and  have loved her recordings for many yrs. This video does not do her artistry  justice. It seems like it was thrown together from rarely seen footage of  her and released without much regard for the overall effect. On the  positive side, it shows interesting in ""behind the scenes""  glimpses of Du Pre performing, rehearsing and generally horsing around with  with several performers including performers Daniel Barenboim, Itzak  Perlman, Zubin Mehta and her teacher, and ""cello daddy"" William  Pleeth (with whom the great mutual admiration is very evident). These  scenes show a playful and fun loving side of her that is quite enchanting.  There is a very funny scene of her horsing around in rehearsal of the  ""Trout Quintet."" She is playing Perlman's violin as a cello and  Perlman playing her cello (as a cello). Unfortunately, the scenes of her in  actual performance are not satisfying. The performance of the Trout has the  camera annoyingly fixed upon her with no variation. Any focus upon the  music is lost. A scene of her rehearsing the Brahms F major cello sonata  with Daniel Barenboim in a recording studio is throw away footage that  should have stayed on the cutting room floor. A performance of the slow  movement of Beethoven's Ghost Trio, while musically interesting, is very  dull. A scene of her performing a small slow segment of the Elgar Concerto  with Barenboim conducting also manages to come across as very dull and  frustrating as you want to see more! Interviews with performers who knew  her are limited to William Pleeth and Sir John Barbirolli. The reflections  from a variety of performers would have added interest. Overall, this video  will be sure to disappoint all but die-hard Du Pre fans.",926726400,19,1944,4.874617737003058
7855689,5,6303874541,"This video which displays Ms DuPre's enthusiasm for music, the cello and her life has inspired me to begin to learn to play the cello.  My two young sons (6 & 9) also have chosen the cello.",918950400,4,189,4.108108108108108
