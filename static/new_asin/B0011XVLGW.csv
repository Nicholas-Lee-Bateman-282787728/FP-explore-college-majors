8242897,5,B0011XVLGW,"A realistic depiction of the cultural atmosphere of the years after the second world war in Greece.  Melina Mercury so alive in her role; although an embarrassment to the middle and upper classes of that society that (still prevailing) thought it unbecoming.  A very ""feminine"" feminist beginning of asserting one self as a woman.  Recommend it full heartedly.",1389744000,,360,5.172413793103448
8242898,5,B0011XVLGW,"The film Stella is one of the Masterpieces of greek Cinema. Very well acted,written and a storyline with many twists and turns. Dated back in 1955 this a story about a man loving a woman and the woman not having the same feelings for him. This film brings to the surface as too the meaning of relationships fro  a social-psychological perspective.",1381708800,,347,4.688524590163935
8242899,3,B0011XVLGW,"Early Mercouri film...could not compare with Phraeda or Never on Sunday.
Her acting had not yet developed; the acting was rather hokey; the story also had not much substance to it.",1371859200,,180,4.838709677419355

17 December 2003: I had never seen a Greek film before, and Stella made me realize how that was my loss.  In one of the most lovable characters ever depicted, Melina Mercouri plays the boisterous character of a night-club singer who's spirit cannot be curbed.  The film is light years ahead of its peers and compares with films such as Cabaret which was made decades later.
* Even though some of the filmmaking is technically crude, the Director's vision shines through and Stella's motivations are painstakingly established with the skill of an auteur. Greek culture with its boisterous cacophony is showcased with pride, as we discover that Stella despite her frolicking ways sets herself the highest standards of integrity and is one of the most honest people you will ever meet.
* The plot is in no real hurry, and ambles along primarily because there are few sub-plots to drive the narrative. But even as we come to the end of the film, a gloom palls over as we realize that we're headed into a deadlock and the film cannot end in hunky-dory fashion, even though we wish it to.
* The interaction between Stella and her would-be mother-in-law is particularly heart-warming because of the honesty of their mutual distaste for each other.
* The character of the footballer is well etched out and as the narrative progresses, we get the sense that the same stubbornness with which he so successfully woos Stella is at some point bound to boomerang on the couple.
* I found the camera angles particularly maverick and avant garde for 1955, and there's a particular scene near the climax whether the inter-cut close-ups of the two characters build up a rhythm.  Here's where the technician's skills are on full display as the pace works its way up, and we have a sequence way ahead of its time, what with hand-held POVs and wide close-up giving that crazy world feel.
I highly recommend this film to any student of film history and to film-lovers who are driven by watching some of the great cinema of its time - for that's what Stella will always be - cinema way ahead of its time.",1073433600,4,2113,4.672043010752688
8242901,5,B0011XVLGW,"The story of a rebellious young Bouzouki performer named Stella (Mercouri) who abhors marriage, defies the rules of conventional morality, and pays for a freedom denied her by the men who love her...
Based on the play, Stella with the Red Gloves by Iakovos Kambanellis. Melina Mercouri stars in her debut film role as a bouzouki singer and dancer who abhors marriage, defies the rules of conventional morality and pays for a freedom denied her by the men who love her. Michael Cacoyannis' second film. ""Melina Mercouri [is] beautifully controlled...There is a pervasive sense of atmosphere that allows the characters to become an organic part of the streets and the houses used for location (the scene with Stella triumphantly riding an open truck to show the neighbors her lover's gift is among the funniest and best observed) and the folklore material (chiefly bouzouki dances and music by Manos Hatzidakis) is dexterously used to enliven the plot"" (International Film Guide).Excellent soundtrack! Music by Manos Hatzidakis, played by a folk orchestra conducted by Vasilis Tsitsanis.",1028764800,5,1085,5.277456647398844
8242902,5,B0011XVLGW,"One of the most sought-out movies is finally out on DVD!!! I do not  understand why a B&W DVD with MONO sound and NO digital remastering  should cost that much. ""Stella"" is probably the best Greek movie  ever, Melina Mercouri is breathtaking but surely something could be done  restoring it! The copy looks like a good VHS recording. We've come to  expect far more from DVDs - just look what has been done in ""Gone with  the wind"" and other cinema masterpieces. And no extras (except  filmographies of the main actors), even the chapters could have been more!",965865600,14,559,4.642857142857143
8242903,5,B0011XVLGW,"Stella is probably considered, as  the best Greek film of all times! Based on J.Kampanellis theatrical play ""Stella with the red gloves"" this movie  gave a new direction to Greek cinema at 1955 , not only because of  its  subversive story but also of its fresh and inventive filming . When every  woman's dream was to get married,  settle down and accomplish  a petty  bourgeois life  Stella went  right the opposite way. She wanted to be  free and  live a non conformist life ,with  the man she loved as long as  their  love was  still alive.  This happens till she meets Miltos the  definite man of her life. Although, she only wants to live in passion with  him, he finally ,like all the other ordinary men  demands from  her to  marry him. She accepts his proposition against her will  but at last, the  day of her marriage, she leaves him, leading the end of the story towards  an ancient Greek tragedy's closure. Metaphorically Stella represents her  country in the decades of 40's and 50's , always wanting to be free but  constantly being suppressed by foreign forces. In this movie marriage and  family life represent the rape of  social  freedom. The magnificent  direction of M. Cacoyiannis is very much close to Italian neorealism.  The  wonderful score and the songs of the film are written by Manos Hadjidakis.  But above all there is ""the last Greek godess"":Melina Mercouri. Melina  Mercouri is not only  excellent as Stella but I think that she  is Stella  herself !  Even though, she lost the first prize for an actress  in a  leading role at Cannes film festival of 1955, she won ""a better one"" by  meeting there the man of her life : Jules Dassin. Together they made :NEVER  ON SUNDAY",963878400,22,1703,4.611486486486487
