183147,4,1561589578,"A good basic introduction to the selection, preparation and turning of timber. Green and seasoned wood is dealt with and many aspects of spindle, face plate (bowl) and cup-chuck turning. Richard Raffan is a world renowned master of the lathe and has an engaging and easy to understand manner. Close up shots and clear focus of the turning process is a feature of the DVD / lesson material. This is a sound, well prepared and presented introduction to the craft of wood turning, tools and timber. I have been turning since 1982 and purchased this to brush up on some bad habits and found it most useful.",1265846400,5,602,4.635514018691588
183148,5,1561589578,"Brilliant DVD ,well put together for beginner to advanced turner. I have most of Richards other DVD'S and they have been well worth the money.
(My wife will disagree as she is fast becoming a woodturning widow but I'm learning to live with the earache!)Missed Richards latest visit to Ireland,Pity i could have spent more money on tools etcetra. I have given in to the ""Shiney tool Syndrome"" recently , oh alright again! and eventually will get around to using them, you all know what its like. And if you don't you haven't been hiding in the workshop long enough",1246838400,5,563,4.64
183149,5,1561589578,Richard Raffan's books are so clear and easy to understand that you feel like he is right there with you. For a beginner they are a great start. I would also recommend the video because even the best drawings are not as good as seeing it done.,1242518400,14,243,4.191489361702128
183150,5,1561589578,I bought this for my husband & he says it's extremely helpful.  I'm pretty sure he watched the section on sharpening your tools about 8 times in the first 3 days.,1433376000,,162,4.225806451612903

183157,5,1561589578,"After buying and using this DVD, I elevated my turning skills substantially after years of spindle work as a self-taught turner.  In fact, I bought this DVD before attempting bowl turning and it has proved invaluable in that respect.  Raffan has been a professional turner for many years and his approach, while not the only one out there, is time tested.  I found his demos and accompanying narrative to be clear, concise, easy to follow, and thorough.  The Taunton video production is first class; it covers all the basics, is well lit, the camera is clearly positioned from many different and useful angles, the pacing of the instruction is neither too fast nor too slow for someone learning to turn bowls, and the various spindle and bowl techniques are broken up into modules (DVD sections) that make sense.
I bought Raffan's two related Taunton Press books, Turning Wood and Turning Bowls, at the same time that I bought this DVD and they supplement the video instruction, but I found the hands-on demos on the DVD far easier to follow and to learn from.  I set up a DVD player + 16"" TV in my shop that allowed me to switch back and forth between the DVD and turning on my lathe.  You can repeat any module or section of a module over and over until it is burned into your brain.  The next best thing to live instruction.",1405296000,,1327,4.550420168067227

183160,5,1561589578,"I have a number of Richard Raffin's books and dvd's and all I can say is that he just gets better and better.  Not only does he present both basic and sophistcated technicques in an easily understandable format & progression, His attention to detail is masterful.  If one simply observes how his shop is set up by looking around his shop as he's teaching, there are many lessons to be learned.  I have a good dust collection system and when I saw how Mr. Raffin did it, I wanted to slap myself in the forehead!!  He has ducting tubes arranged iaround the headstock of his lathe s so that there are multiple intakes for chips dust and all the other waste that develops when one is turning.  The ducting set up was a lesson in itself.  I learn something new everytime I watch his DVD's.  In his early DVD's  he doesn't have a dust collecter in his shop, but in this one he does.  So, I hired my plumber to come in and modify the four inch duct work and add more intakes on my system to reduce the amount of sawdust in my shop.  It took a while to do it, but I can already see the difference.  My shop is cleaner and I and my friends who work with me aren't breathing in as much dust.  Thanks so much, Mr. Raffin!!!  God bless!

183161,5,1561589578,"This is a great companion to Raffan's books. Some things are difficult to understand by reading (though Raffan does a very good job of explaining!), this is where the video comes in and makes things clear.",1391212800,,205,4.722222222222222
183162,5,1561589578,Great training video for the beginner who needs to learn the basic fundamentals of the lathe and tools for turning.  Got my first lathe yesterday and used the techniques demonstrated in the video.  The safety points taught are spmething I needed before operating a lathe for the first time.,1389830400,,290,4.8979591836734695
183163,5,1561589578,"I found this to be a very good review of stuff I knew and great teaching video for stuff I didn't.  I know I shall be replaying this video quite a few times.  I bought the ""streaming"" form and have found I really like that option.  I can view this video from my computer, my laptop or my Roku/TV.  I will look for this option on just about any video I buy from now on.",1371772800,,368,3.8666666666666667
183164,4,1561589578,"I've turned a lot of pens and am looking to expand my turning projects. This DVD is a good way to broaden your skills by being able to see turning being done. Nothing like the real thing to get a feel for something.

However, Raffan goes quickly through aspects that I certainly could have used more instruction, such as when to choose a particular tool over another, more detail on how to cut with different parts of a tool's edge, and even sharpening, though to be fair I suppose I just need to find a system that works for me and practice it.

Watching him whip out several projects is amazing. For me, these were more of a demonstration of his skill rather than functional information that I can use. By the end, I felt that rather than being more skilled myself, or at least have the information to progress in my turning, that what I really need is to take classes somewhere and this DVD established goals for me to strive towards. Maybe that's the actual point here.",1370476800,4,973,4.430167597765363
183165,5,1561589578,"as a new turner it was most helpfull
if i knew i needed 12 more words it would not have been filled in",1368230400,,102,3.4782608695652173
183166,5,1561589578,"The original ""Turning Wood"" video with Richard is what I would describe as ""painfully low-def"".
This one is better, certainly not awful to watch, quality wise.
Richard does a great job of explaining basically every basic turning technique your going to use (save some advanced things). He shows common mistakes (catches, etc) and how to fix them and how to avoid them. He goes through sharpening various tools and turning projects from goblets, to eggs, to bowls.
Whether you're a veteran turner, or just getting into the addiction, you should take the time to watch this video.",1367884800,,578,4.969072164948454

183169,4,1561589578,This is a very informative DVD and something that I will refer back to as I learn to turn bowls.,1357171200,,96,3.85
183170,5,1561589578,I am new to the lathe. You can read alot of books on use of turning tools and technique but being able to watch is much better. It is like someone present teaching you.  I would almost like to put an old TV/dvd player in my shop and watch this video at the lathe.  The only  thing I question is his shapening on a grinder rather than exclusively on his Tomak water cooled stone!,1356048000,,378,4.081081081081081
183171,5,1561589578,Richard Raffan is impressive to watch at a lathe. This DVD will help beginners and the intermeadate turner although Bowl Basics by Mike Malhoney might be better for beginners just starting out. Be prepared to pause and rewind. There is a lot of technique to study.,1351468800,,264,4.760869565217392
183172,4,1561589578,"For a new Wood-turner like me, this gave good visual basic procedures for turning with the different turning tools. After watching this video, I was able use the skew chisel very well.",1349481600,,184,4.78125
183173,5,1561589578,"This book is very informative, it covers all the basic wood turning tools and know how. I would recomend this book to anyone starting out on a wood lathe or just to get a refresher course.",1331251200,,188,4.25
183174,5,1561589578,"Richard Raffan is without a doubt a leading light in Woodturning, and this is almost as good as having attending a private class with him.  He covers all areas of woodturning, from basics of the lathe, tools, sharpening, and of course, turning.

I found the first part to be a bit pedantic, as he went a bit into the background of what makes a good lathe, dust control, sharpening.  Not bad material, but perhaps just a bit excessive.

All of that changes once the wood is chucked up and the lathe is spinning.  He does an excellent job of explaining HOW a cut is made, lots of very clear shots at various angles make it clear how the job gets done, what goes wrong, and how to fix it.

I loved the part where he turned an egg, had a catch at the very end, and then showed how you would simply rework it to fix it.  The section on facework and bowl turning was very helpful to me also.

If you want a good guide, presented by an individual who knows what he's doing, and presented in a very approachable way, this is the one to get.  I rented it, but am seriously considering a purchase, so that I can keep watching it, picking up fine points, building my skills.

It serves my needs well, with advice about lathes, advice on sharpening chisels, advice on the purposes of various chisels, how to advice on using various chisels, and how to advice on many different kinds of turning projects.  I highly recommend this video especially for those NEW to turning wood.  Happy Turning to You!",1325376000,7,387,4.647058823529412
183176,5,1561589578,"Raffan is one of the better wood turning instructors in the world and he has a very famous series of books on the subject.

For those getting started in turning, like myself, a book can only help you so much.  Being able to see him use a bowl gouge or skew chisel is much better in action than a still picture.

He is very instruction, personable and can definitely turn wood.

Highly recommended for beginners.",1313020800,5,411,4.44

183179,4,1561589578,"This was a great DVD to watch. I also have the book. It was nice to watch and learn how to turn bowls on a lathe. Sometimes you need to be able to see it being done instead of just reading about it.

I highly recommend this DVD to anyone interested in bowl turning. The book is also well written.

7796222,5,1561589578,Great video professionally done. This guy is a real pro who has made thousands of things and wastes no time in doing it. The speed he uses scares me but he is a master. I learned some good tips and a little about the guy. He lives in Australia. Worth the money to me but if you are an advanced wood turner it might not be for you.,1456099200,,330,3.8676470588235294
7796223,3,1561589578,"First of all this is more of a complaint about the delivery process than the video content or the author itself. This was my first streaming/download purchase of a video from Amazon and my last I have to say.
I initially downloaded the video to my android 10 inch tablet, somewhere in the order of 2gb. I also selected 'best quality'. Unfortunately the video quality is below par for paying so much, if this were a $5 purchase I might be more forgiving. It certainly does not meet the described quality of SD being 'DVD quality'. Imagine a second rate youtube video of around 240p and you might get the idea. Trying to discern finer details of what was being done was a complete waste of time.
I also was under the impression by the statement 'download to 2 of your devices' that I could put this on my PC, possibly using a player that might improve the artifacts on the video. No such luck, apparently PC's aren't supported, only tablets and phones. Something about the anti-piracy measures. So once again, the paying customer cops it in the neck. I paid for it, Amazon says I own it, so let me play it where and how I want! Knowing this I would have saved some money and simply rented it,
I then tried streaming it on the PC, thinking that a fast connection might somehow deliver the 'dvd quality' video I had purchased, exactly the same I am disappointed to say.
I think this is my first and only negative review of an Amazon purchase ever.
My only issue with the content is that the last section on bowl/faceplate turning, was a direct copy of what I have on a DVD by Richard Raffan called Turning Bowls. Bit of a cheek to reproduce what's on another DVD in my opinion.
That being said, there's some good advice and instruction for the starting turner but I would recommend buying a physical DVD than this poor representation.
I am bitterly disappointed with Amazon over this and the price does not reflect what you end up with. As stated earlier, my last purchase of an online movie from Amazon if this is the expected output. If this helps save someone the grief I'll have to find some solace in that.
Buyer beware.",1454025600,,2121,4.455012853470437
