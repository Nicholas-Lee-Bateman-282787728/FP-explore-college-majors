8217227,2,B000V8W39M,"I purchased this product before I was set to photograph my first wedding of this year. I have photographed weddings before, but I really believe there is always a lot more you can learn... I was hoping there would be some of that in this video. I would say my personal Kryptonite when it comes to wedding photography is lighting. I was hoping that I might be able to come up with some new ideas, especially for this particular wedding I was about to work on that had more harsh fluorescent lights (without covers) than a typical school classroom.
  So for the very low price of about $4.50, I received this video along with ""Learn Wedding Photography"". Both of the covers show up to date pictures and for the price, I really felt like I could not go wrong. Now for someone who has never photographed a wedding this video (for the price of $4.50) may not be that bad of an idea. Here is where it gets a bit sticky. I mentioned above both covers are up to date giving you the illusion that they are as well up to date... this is not the case. On the back of the DVD case it states, ""Graphics and pictures shown on DVD packaging may not appear in this DVD video"". I can assure you that the cover picture did not appear in the video. Amazon lists this video as first being available in 2004, and on the back of the DVD it says the artwork is from 2007.
  Now the video itself has some useful tips, but a lot of the time you are watching things that aren't really necessary. The video looks like it was shot on a old camcorder. The next problem is there is one video camera... this means there is no editing pieces together to make a cohesive easy to watch instructional video. The different sections are shot straight through at the same time you are listening to the man ramble on, which made it feel more like he was trying to make sure I was still listening than telling me something informational.
  The other big issue for me was that the pictures he took were taken with an old larger format film camera. The pictures that I am shooting are with a professional grade digital SLR camera. Though a lot of people interested in this video may not have professional equipment, I can imagine most would be using a digital camera. As much as I miss the darkroom, digital pictures are now the ""norm"". The reason I bring this up is newer digital cameras, even nonprofessional cameras come with settings and software to adjust the pictures afterward.
  This video was very hard to sit through. It did have some helpful lighting information, but most of the pictures were taken outside, so there was very little on any light source other than natural daylight.
  I gave this video two stars because I believe there is information that is useful if you are BRAND NEW to wedding photography, at least at this price. However, remember that there is no digital pictures, and the cover picture does not at all resemble the content of the DVD. Feel free to ask me any questions if you want before purchasing this video.
