8058610,5,B0009A3HJ2,"This movie is killer. Two full length features on one dvd, awesome soundtrack, goofy 90's clips stuffed into the riding footage. I love this movie so much that it made me run out and buy a '91 RM 125 to ride along with my modern 4 stroke bikes. This is the perfect movie to get your through rainy/snowy weather until riding season comes back around!",1424217600,,349,4.384615384615385
8058611,1,B0009A3HJ2,"Haven't even watched it yet, but I was under the impression that this was a new item. True, it did arrive in sealed packaging, but the box is scratched and broken, and covered in dirty stickers (some of which were written on with pen). Since this is for a gift, I'm not real happy. I'll keep it because I'm too lazy to return it.",1417996800,,329,4.15625
8058612,3,B0009A3HJ2,"Several good camera shots, but mostly mediocre.  Seems to be the same type shots throughout the video over and over again.",1397865600,,122,4.809523809523809

8058614,5,B0009A3HJ2,"It's kinda old school, but good.  I got a kick out of seeing all the 2-strokes and chrome-moly frames haha.  Good music from bands I've actually heard of.",1300752000,4,154,4.464285714285714
8058615,5,B0009A3HJ2,"they sent it quick, got it in maybe 4 days or so.good place to go to.",1215648000,,69,3.375
