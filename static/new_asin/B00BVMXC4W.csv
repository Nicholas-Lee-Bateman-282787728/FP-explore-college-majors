5677769,5,B00BVMXC4W,love the series and very sorry there will be no more,1409184000,,52,3.8181818181818183
5677770,5,B00BVMXC4W,"Have watched all other seasons on BBC iPlayer, but this one was not shown.  Am delighted with the DVD . . . good quality production.  Would highly recommend ""Waking the Dead"" as a ""must watch"" series!",1409184000,,200,4.527777777777778
5677771,2,B00BVMXC4W,Too much emphasis on women detective and the main character does nothing but scream all the time.,1407715200,,97,4.764705882352941
5677772,5,B00BVMXC4W,Loved the entire series.  So sorry it ended.,1404518400,,44,4.5
5677773,4,B00BVMXC4W,I have hooked on waking the dead from the moment that I saw the first one. They are very good and it keep my attention,1401148800,,118,3.76
5677774,5,B00BVMXC4W,"Great action and suspense mixed with more than a few shockers. All the old favorites are back and a new member joins the team while another grows restive and plans to leave.
Michelle Dockery as one of the principles is a nice surprise for those of us Yanks who are accustomed to having seen her only as Lady Mary (Downton Abbey). Her role here gives her an opportunity to expand her range in a role that is a broad departure from Lady Mary; though I can't say I liked the ending, it was skillfully done / written, placing her character in a ""role"" she'd never imagined for her (character's) self. As close to a spoiler as I dare venture.
The return of my favorite villianess in this series, Linda Cummings is a very apt end to the season, filled with rapid fire action and machinations as she spars with Boyd in a game of wits and evil cunning (on her part, natch). Great stories / writing.... can hardly wait for Season 9 to arrive on my doorstep!",1396828800,4,948,4.361581920903955
5677775,5,B00BVMXC4W,This series gets better with each season.  I love the development of the characters and of the plots.  Can't wait for season 9,1395360000,,126,4.434782608695652
5677776,5,B00BVMXC4W,"The premise of the series has always been grade A beats any of the Cold Case series from the U.S.
Many of the endings are quite unexpected which adds to the high quality of the production.",1392940800,,188,4.25
5677777,5,B00BVMXC4W,this is a very good show about old forgotten criminal cases in U.K looking foeward for the new one let me know when the come out,1390003200,,128,3.9615384615384617
5677778,5,B00BVMXC4W,"I have always been a huge fan of this show. Of course we all watch it because of the lead actor in it. His character is very abrasive and abusive to his coworkers , but they love him and they know he's a good man.  This season was 8 eps long and we get it on standard dvd here. It was shown in hd in the uk. WHy we can't get more uk shows on American tv is beyond me.  It's a good way for a network to get good programing and fill in gaps when other shows are not on.  Still this one is now gone , so it's a moot point. this one is from 2009. And we get a return of the evil mastermind serial killer , who is a female no less; and quite a good villain. One of the eps was weak in my opinion. And it is probably the weakest in the history of the show. It's about body parts selling.  But it's still a good ep; as this show never made a bad ep imo it is just weak for this great show.. Still for some it may leave a bad taste in their mouth because of the ending.  THe rest of the show are typical two parters and fit into the waking the dead mode.  There's one more series left to come out on this hit show which could have lasted more years , but tt's network cancelled it due to their desire to put new shows on. regardless of the fact that this was a hit for 11 years. (two of which had no shows on though).  On dvd looks as good as tit can in spite of the fact it was shot in hd.  There are NO extras , but for many of these tv shows from the uk , that's normal. At least we get to see them finally.",1386374400,,1502,3.671875
5677799,5,B00BVMXC4W,"THIS SERIES NEVER DISAPPOINTS
JUST WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNEW THE CHARACTERS....YOU DON'T
LOADS OF TWIST AND TURNS
IT IS HARD NOT TO WATCH THE WHOLE SERIES IN ONE GO",1383004800,,162,4.433333333333334
5677800,5,B00BVMXC4W,"It is my understanding that there is only going to be one more season of ""Waking the Dead"" which makes me very sad, I've grown to love this series with its very intense stories and characters--such great acting, direction and stories.  Season Eight (8) certainly has all of the aforesaid attributes that has caused me to adore this series.  Once again, in Season Eight (8) Boyd, as leader of a brilliant British ""cold case"" team, solve some very intense and frightening cases that have gone ""cold"" but with ""tie ins"" with current murders.  Boyd is still very ""short-fused"" which leads to many battles with his team--the psychologist Grace (wonderfully acted by Sue Johnston) , the very good detective and sexy Spence (greatly acted by Will Johnson), other detectives and a pathologist.  All of the members of the ""Cold Case"" team are more than willing to go ""toe to toe"" with their leader Boyd when they disagree with his ""methods"" in solving  a case.  Those heated battles are the prime reason I have admired this series for so long.  Season 8 is filled with those ""battles"" involving the lost of a team member and also featuring the pathologist Eve--the actress that plays pathologist Eve truly gives  an overwhelming performance in one story really proving that she is a superb actress. In that two part episode,  Spence (as acted by Will Johnson) also shines as an actor!

Yes, there are only four (4) episodes that run about an hour and forty minutes each in Season Eight (8) instead of the usual six (6).  However, because this season is so superbly written, directed and acted, I was greatly entertained.",1382745600,9,1611,4.800724637681159
5677801,4,B00BVMXC4W,I enjoyed this but not as much as season 7 and some of the previous ones.  But still I am anxious for the next season to be available.,1382572800,,134,3.7857142857142856
5677802,4,B00BVMXC4W,Very freightening and riviting; it's so scary that we don't look at these stories before bed. It's not for children however.,1382486400,,124,4.9523809523809526
5677803,4,B00BVMXC4W,"Same great show, same price but only 4 stories compared to previous seasons. Each story has two 58-minute episodes. Don't get me wrong, this show is very much worth watching and if you enjoyed previous seasons you won't regret the effort.  I just want the usual ~6 stories if they are going to charge the same price.

SPOILER ALERT!
The team is whirling with change and potential change as they move into a new location, a team member dies(this was shocking and unexpected) and another leaves.

5 stars for the show minus 1 for fewer episodes/price.  Please indicate if this review was helpful.",1379894400,13,594,4.737864077669903
5677804,5,B00BVMXC4W,"I noticed a 1 star review and wanted to counter it.  Yes Waking the Dead is one of the premier TV series from the UK.  It is thoughtful and intelligent.  Series 8 and it final season 9 are excellent.  I have seen the UK versions of it.  The criticism is not the content or the series, but release schedule for a series that already completed.  Come on.  Finish the releases and the series.  How come the US versions are delayed by years.",1375920000,13,437,4.2439024390243905
5677805,5,B00BVMXC4W,"My husband and I were fans of the earlier series of Waking the Dead and were very disappointed when the later DVDs were not Region 1 compatible any longer.  Finally, I realized that an all region DVD player would solve our problem and we are back enjoying Boyd at his almost at tantrum throwing best.

Interesting new member of the team adds another interesting dynamic in the latter series.",1374364800,5,391,4.6521739130434785
5677806,5,B00BVMXC4W,"Waking the Dead: Season 8 is a preorder and won't be released until September, so I won't have any opinion until then. I have all seven of the series and I love the series very much, so I am quite sure I will be rating the season eight with a 5 star as well.  I do feel that being asked to rate a series that hasn't been released yet is unfair.  I usually don't respond to the requests, but they just don't stop coming.",1372636800,,419,3.9761904761904763
5677807,5,B00BVMXC4W,"We will soon run out of this series and that is too bad.  These characters, Boyd, Grace, Spence, et al, are the most interesting and complex characters since Hill Street Blues.  We will feel like family is missing and will be reduced to watching something much less satisfying and interesting.  If you haven't seen any of Waking the Dead yet, start with the First Season and prepare for a bumpy ride!",1353801600,7,400,4.605633802816901
5677808,3,B00BVMXC4W,"It's a pity, but this Dutch Pal import has all episodes shortened by approx 10 minutes. The cutting has been done ""gently"", but leaves some strange ellipses.
No subtitles other than Dutch ones.
Otherwise good quality.",1338595200,6,217,5.055555555555555
