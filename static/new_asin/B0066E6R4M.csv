4962201,5,B0066E6R4M,"The series is great, and recommend this to all history students. I also believe the series is accurate and the best part are the battle scenes. I like the one in the Egypt Campaign. The ending is also great, but it did not explain the main reasons why Napoleon was exile to St. Helena, after the loss in Waterloo. The end is not really the complete saga, its just the beginning of the myth, Napoleon.",1329609600,7,400,4.346666666666667
4962202,5,B0066E6R4M,"I first saw this when I was 14 yrs old.  Not knowing anything of history, mainly preoccupied with cars, trucks and tractors.  Then I saw this on TV with my parents and it opened my eyes, to the French Revolution, Marie Antoinette, the British Regency and Napoleonic France.  This TV series is made best by the amazing array of stars and their talent set against the backdrop of some of the most beautiful palaces in France.

I have waited a long time for this TV series to be released on DVD and I was so impatient to get it that I paid for the next day delivery, which is something I never do!",1328486400,10,594,4.230088495575221
4962203,5,B0066E6R4M,"I was delighted to find out that ""Napoleon and Josephine: A Love Story"" is, 25 years after its original airing, finally on commercial DVD. I taped this to VHS way back in 1987 when it first broadcast, only (much to my dismay) to accidentally tape part of it over with something else. Over the years since, I've hunted down and traded for VHS and DVD-R copies of varying qualities from video collectors. That this classic has finally gotten an official release gives me a lot of hope that another great 1980's TV costume epic, Simon Langton's ""Casanova"", will soon receive the same treatment.

This miniseries is sumptuously produced, with affecting performances by Armand Assante (Napoleon) and Jacqueline Bisset (Josephine) at its core, fittingly so since the film is, after all, about the relationship of this legendary couple. The movie is overall quite accurate in its depiction of the story, reproducing many famous events both from Napoleon's life and that of the duo. This is really, I think, Jackie Bisset's movie, and she makes one of the best Josephines I've seen - though, to be sure, she's quite a bit more attractive than the real-life Josephine de Beauharnais, who made up for what she might have lacked in looks with tremendous charm and allure.  Armand Assante makes a commanding, passionate Napoleon, and Stephanie Beacham, one of my personal favorites, does well in her supporting role as Josephine's closest friend Therese Tallien. The disk is rather Spartan in its setup (no extras, no closed-captioning) but the video transfer quality is excellent.

UPDATE/NOTE: As is the case with many of the ""Archive Series"" DVD's produced by Warner Brothers, these on-demand DVD-R's are guaranteed only for DVD players and might or might not play in certain drives, as specified on the packaging (usually PC DVD drives or DVD recorders). Disc 2 (which contains parts 2 and 3 of the miniseries) wouldn't load in my desktop's DVD writer drive, but did load and play in my laptop's DVD writer drive. I think this may be because of the way the disc was recorded to fit more video material on a single disc (Disc 2 is over 180 minutes total); certain devices, especially if they're older, might or might not be able to decipher the recording format.",1328313600,38,2253,4.908136482939632
4962204,5,B0066E6R4M,"I am so excited to find out that this movie is now on DVD.  I had recorded this myself about 12 years ago on VCRS.  It is wonderful!  I love Armand Assante, he is  so masterful in this, and a perfect Napoleon.  I was a member of the board of the Napoleonic Society of America, so I am in a position to know how well he was depicted. and.it is very accurate.  Also loved Jacqueline Bisset in this...she was a perfect Josephine.  I went to Malmaison on a Napoleonic tour which is beautifully depicted in this movie.
Even if you didn't love Napoleon, this is a passionate story of love, seduction, and some betrayals.  Armande Assante brings Napoleon to life.
This movie is a MUST for Napoleonic fans, and also for those who are into love stories...this is the best ever!  I highly recommend it..and thanks to someone for putting it on DVD's",1326585600,23,838,4.42483660130719

4962299,5,B0066E6R4M,This movie does an excellent job of recreating the relationship of Napoleon and Josephine. The events are historically accurate and their chemistry works well!,1394668800,2,159,5.666666666666667
4962300,5,B0066E6R4M,"I have watched this production over and over and still love watching it each time.  It is so well done and so beautiful as well.  Tells the story clearly and shows just how much Napoleon was obsessed with her.  Unfortunately they gave each other the greatest love of their lives but also hurt each other tremendously.  Their story is complex as they each find they love each other at different times in their relationship and remain in love despite not being able to meet each others needs.  Armand and Jacqueline give the best performances of their careers and yet this movie was never popular, and that escapes me as I have no idea why.  It is brilliant and if you love this time period you will not be dissapointed.  It is one of my favorite period pieces.  However, remember it was created in the 80s and moves slower than todays movies.  Hang in there though as it really is worth it despite the pace.",1394150400,2,906,4.475609756097561

I'm so happy to finally have it in my DVD collection!",1390089600,,404,5.2153846153846155
4962302,5,B0066E6R4M,My favorite version of Napoleon and Josephine. He was great and a believable Napoleon and she was beautiful and a graceful Josephine. This was a story well told of one of world's greatest love story.,1383696000,,199,4.714285714285714
4962303,5,B0066E6R4M,This was a tv mini-series. I think Armand Assante is an underated actor.  He brings me to tears on this movie. He never disappoints!,1377993600,,132,4.5
4962304,5,B0066E6R4M,Armand Assante is the best Napoleon I have ever seen playing the role. He was magnificence. Very convincing performance. Now they should make a movie showing how Napoleon was slowly poisoned by his wine steward on St. Helena because of orders from the King of France.....Read Ben Weider's book on how this was done.

4962305,4,B0066E6R4M,"I watched this series when it first came out and I enjoyed every minute of it.  I think that there will never be a better Napoleon than
Armande Assante. The writing is good and there are some laugh-out-loud moments as when Napoleon answers Robespierre's demands with a simple and terse ""no!""  The settings and costumes are beautiful.  But the series has aged some and seems a bit contrived with made-up sub-plots.  Still, I think It's well worth having.",1375574400,,453,4.769230769230769
4962327,5,B0066E6R4M,Great series about the relationship between Napoleon Bonaparte and Josephine.  Provides some good historical background on the period and the eventual rise of Napoleon to Emperor of France.  Story is basically true to historical facts surrounding the relationship between Napoleon and Josephine.  The series focuses mostly on their relationship with a healthy does of military campaigns thrown in.  Fun to watch and you will learn something too!,1365897600,2,445,5.597014925373134
4962328,5,B0066E6R4M,"I was never a fan of Armand Asante but he is perfect for this role. I've never seen it better played. And, I always thought that Jacqueline Bisset was only a so so  actress but she does a wonderful job in this.  I taped this when it ran on t.v. many years ago and still have it. I've ordered the DVD and am looking forward to seeing it without all those horrible long commercials that have to be fast forwarded over.  Before going to France the first time I did a long study of the history of France which, of course, included a study of Napoleon and Josephine.  I visited Malmaison while I was in France the first time just to see where so much of their story took place. Nothing like standing where they stood so to speak.  As I have said, this is my favorite of the movies I've seen about Napoleon. Asante never puts a foot wrong in his portrayal and the same may be said for Bisset. Later: I have received the DVD and checked the end. One reviewer had said that only half the movie was on his DVD. This one is complete and seems to be excellent quality.",1365465600,3,1057,4.161764705882353
4962329,5,B0066E6R4M,"Fans of lush programs like Dynasty will enjoy this miniseries. No expense is spared in showing the detail of the French bourgeosie striving to live like the aristocracy they replaced. The acting is very good, especially the two leads, Jacqueline Bisset and Armand Assante. In my book, Josephine was one of the smartest women in history. I'd like to see a new movie done about her as they did Marie Antoinette. If Marie had been as intelligent as Josephine, she probably would have survived the French Revolution.",1363996800,2,512,4.896551724137931

4962332,5,B0066E6R4M,"A made for TV movie from 1987 about one of the greatest (and perhaps tragic) love stories of all time; the Corsican upstart and impoverished, but ravishing and aristocratic Josephine. The story line is a bit campy (especially the battle scenes), and not exactly historically accurate (besides, a brown eyed Napoleon? Oh well). Filmed largely on location in all its opulant grandeur with exquisitely designed period costumes. This one of the better made for TV movies made during the 70's and 80's when these type of movies were popular. The video quality was very good.

If you're into the Napoleonic Era, enjoy beautiful costumes and settings, or simply enjoy a good love story, this two disc video is a good buy. Armand Assante stars as Napoleon Bonaparte with Jacqueline Bisset as Josephine. Anthony Perkins, Stephanie Beacham, Patrick Cassidy, and Ione Skye round out the cast.",1350864000,4,881,5.075862068965518

As soon as I saw this was by Warner Brothers, my excitement dwindled to despair.  And yes, in checking IMDB, this miniseries is missing 10 minutes of footage.

How can it be that movies are being released and there is no note that they are not complete?  Shouldn't this be (dare I say it) ILLEGAL.  Why does Warner Brothers keep doing this to beloved miniseries that we wait and wait for? The prices are set high enought that they shouldn't have to scrimp.

The period of the so-called ""Great Terror"" was instituted by the fanatical acting king Maximillien Robespierre in an attempt to squash internal dissent. It came to an end on July 28, 1794, when he was guillotined. His execution was not a day too soon in sparing the life of Josephine and the release of the jailed Napoleon. Josephine was widowed with a 14-year-old son and 12-year-old daughter when she became acquainted with Napoleon, a neophyte with little experience or appeal to women (until he became well-known). He fell in love at first sight and within days proposed marriage. She was frank in her decline, telling him she did not want to be possessed or dominated by any man as she was with her late husband. She told him she did not feel love for him as he professed for her. He said he could accept that; it didn't matter; that it was more important to give love than to receive it. She, a female Casanova type, wanted to be at liberty to have casual liaisons with whomever she chose. She was pressured by the influential French Director Paul Barras, a former lover, to placate their illustrious brigadier general. So on March 9, 1796, they were married.
