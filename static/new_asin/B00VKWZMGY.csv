8710494,5,B00VKWZMGY,"A marshall and his deputies come to town to arrest a respected citizen on his wedding day for the murder of the marshalls brother. This a great western with tension from beginning to end. Its focus is mob mentality. Good acting, a good story, and plenty of action. If you're a western fan or just a fan of good movies, this is must see viewing.",1491004800,,344,4.3076923076923075
