4647026,5,B005BSQ2XA,"As an LMT, I am always looking for ways to improve my client's outcome.  Many times clients want the ""ooohhh"" of a relaxing massage, but they also want relief from chronic or acute pain or discomfort.  I have found Dr. James' Thai Acupressure Massage DVD a great way to meld both goals in a way which still does not disrupt the relaxation of the client.  The techniques are shown and taught clearly, and are simple to include into a traditional massage. I started off with just a few for the feet, and have added more for the face and hands as I have become more adept.  This DVD is very well made and shot, and my clients have loved the additional touches I can easily incorporate into their sessions.",1398729600,,702,4.4186046511627906

8464227,5,B005BSQ2XA,"I am a licensed esthetician and am always interested in updating my skills. I have bought videos from Aesthetic Video Source before and I have found them to be top notch in education. Thai Acuppressure Massage: Hands, Feet and Face For The Mat is no exception. Dr Anthony James is not only incredibly well qualified (he wrote the first English Thai massage book back in 1984) but he is also an amazingly natural teacher. I am able to confidently apply what I have learned from this video already. Throughout the video (over 2 1/2 hours long!) Dr James clearly explains what he is doing and why. The camera work is exceptional and it is so easy to follow along. The video begins with information about Thai massage and Dr. James's credentials. He then moves on to how to add this massage to your practice, then on to foot reflexology, then hand and then face. All three are interesting and easy to apply to an esthetics practice. The video ends with several extra methods such as hands free and chair massage. I really can't recommend this video any more highly. I had no knowledge of this type of massage before watching this video and now feel confident enough to incorporate this into my facial treatments. He has also piqued my interest in his technique and am thinking about taking some classes at his school.",1433203200,,1313,4.639484978540772
