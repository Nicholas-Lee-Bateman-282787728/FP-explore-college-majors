8107635,5,B000E98428,I struggled with the problem of how to tell my 8 year old daughter that she has aspergers.  This DVD solved that problem for me.  My daughter watched it with me and realized on her own that she has aspergers.  The descriptions the lady on the DVD gives of what it is like to be autistic are very accurate.  My daughter watched it several times and was stunned that everyone didn't see/feel things the way she does.  It's a very good DVD to watch if you want an autistic view of life.,1225152000,,483,4.206521739130435
8107636,3,B000E98428,"This video only scratches the surface.  It was pretty well done, but did not go into enough depth with ABA THERAPY.  I found a few things that the girl said to be very interesting.  It allowed for a better understanding of why hand flapping and other movements is needed.  I hope to see a sequel.  If you have a someone you know with Autism, any info is golden.

thx,

8107637,5,B000E98428,"I am on my second year of teaching children with autism. This video is a must-see for anyone - parent, teacher, therapist - who wants to delve more into the world of autism. The therapist, Kelly, was very insightful into her world of autism. I have always heard how important diet is in autism and Kelly tells you why. I would have loved to see her work one-on-one with her students, but overall it was an excellent video! This would be a great video for mandatory teacher inservices.",1202169600,3,484,4.511363636363637
8107638,5,B000E98428,"I learned many things about autism watching The Autistic ABA Therapist DVD.  I was amazed to learn about the gluten and casien free diet would help with language abilities. The therapist described how she has heightened senses, for example, how her clothes would feel on her body.",1202083200,,280,4.957446808510638
8107639,5,B000E98428,"As a teacher of students with Autism, I always wondered what is it like to have the disability.  I also wondered how would I describe it to other professionals who are struggling to understand the phenomenon.  The ABA therapist's description of what someone without Autism would have to experience to feel Autistic.  This scenarios helped to put my questions in perspective.  Her description of the three radios on static channels, the essay being read aloud and the disco bulb spinning all at the same time, made it easy to understand their  world.  I could only imagine going through this experience and becoming frustrated with all the distractions.  This video also helped me to understand even further the need for persons with Austism to have lifelong support.  It was refreshing to see that the young lady in the video could share her experience with the parent to help him understand his child's world.",1201910400,,910,4.940789473684211
8107640,4,B000E98428,"As a person pursuing my Master's in Special Education, this documentary still opened my eyes to aspects of autism I had never learned about or encountered. Interviewing a person who actually has autism gives such honest insight into the details of daily living with such sensitivity to the world around them. The autist ABA therapist answers intimate questions that wouldn't be answered by a doctor or someone who wasn't well-acquainted with a person with autism.
The documentary was short, informative, and left me with a sense of hope knowing that people with autism can adapt to living in a sometimes over-stimulating world.
Thank you for this video!",1201737600,,653,5.11214953271028
8107641,2,B000E98428,I had expected the interview would explore how the therapist worked with children labelled autistic and what she thought was most helpful in what she does.  Perhaps she will make another dvd going in to detail about children she has worked with.  The interview focussed a good deal on dietary issues.  I would have been very interested in specifics of what the therapist does in sessions with individual children.,1194825600,,413,4.956521739130435
8107642,5,B000E98428,"Until I saw this video, I didn't know how functional an autistic person could be.  I was amazed when Kelly (The Autistic ABA Therapist) said that she didn't know she had a headache every day of her life until she stopped eating certain foods.

I have a daughter with Autism and it gave us greater insight into her life.  The interviews were informational and encouraging and made me feel hopeful for our daughters future.",1167436800,5,421,4.662162162162162
8107643,3,B000E98428,"This DVD was a disappointed in several ways:  (1) The sound quality wasn't what it should have been given the price of the DVD.  I could barely hear the interviewer who seemed to be off screen at a distance when questioning Kelly, the autistic ABA therapist; (2) I expected more focus on Kelly's work with other children beside's the interviewer's son; (3) I thought that she would be should in varied settings with different children/families; (4) The overall production had a home-made feel to it, though it was good that commentary was provided by a pediatrician who briefly spoke about introducing the GFCF diet to his son.  Also, Kelly's mother's comments added another human element.  The DVD jacket design is fine and it was one of the reasons why I bought it.  Still, I felt elements were missing that would have made it a first-rate production.  I wouldn't recommend this video to anyone expecting something more than a second-rate interview overall.",1164499200,7,959,4.925465838509317
