8343485,4,B001UEFHLC,"A concert video Tangerine Dream performing music from Edgar Froese's solo catalog, with music going back to his second album, Epsilon in Malaysian Pale, was very appealing to me in concept.  In actuality I wish they had done it differently.  Oh, the music is excellent and the late Edgar Froese, who died suddenly earlier this week, has a vintage Mellotron M100 to play in addition to all the modern electronics.  Some of the pieces are very close to the original; others have been ""Tangentized"" (revised to a more modern sound) but not drastically.  I particularly enjoyed the performances of Maroubra Bay and many of the tracks from Ages and Stuntman.  Iris Camaa finds ways to incorporate drums and percussion into pieces that originally had drum machines only or no percussion at all, and yet it sounds like it all belongs.  Sadly, neither she nor the rest of the band is playing all of it.  Some of it is obviously preprogrammed.

My one quibble is that the performance segments are in black and white while the background video is often presented full screen in color.  I would have rather had real life color images of the band playing.  Oh well... four stars instead of five, but still an interesting performance.",1421971200,,1221,4.7990430622009566
8343486,5,B001UEFHLC,"Again this is in PAL so you need a player like this one

http://www.amazon.com/Magnasonic-MAG-MDVD500-Portable-Widescreen-Function/dp/B003LT8OPU

for $74 which then plugs into your TV. Sure wish these would play on regular US sets, but they don't. This player plays US Dvds, European DVD's, CD's, flash drives, camera SD cards, without any drama, plus radio and a 7"" LCD screen, with 3 jacks to output to your TV. I'm sure it could probably rub your back if you took the time to read all it can do. It works on 12 volts or 110

This DVD has a lot more of Linda Spa on wind instruments & a little less Iris Camaa. It seems there is very little duplication of music amoung the 2007 to 2009 TD DVD's so each is different. This one has a lot of shots of Edgar from the past thrown in, like the cover. But the music is new. It is getting hard to pick a favorite TD concert, they are all worth having.",1357257600,,895,4.379518072289157
