3162410,2,B0016OM3TK,"This movie has a great premise and story--too bad the director couldn't make it work. I wanted to like this movie, with its noirish cinematography and jazz storyline, but it falls short of being a good film. It has a good cast of character actors from the '40s, and the cinematography of some scenes is excellent. But it misses in the telling of its story--it's too thin and the melodrama is forced, and the story seems to keep making sharp turns without providing a smooth narrative.

(Spoilers follow.) There's no allusion to the emotional feelings the main character, Jigger, has for Kay Grant, the sharply edged would-be singer, until he tells her he loves her, which seems to come out of the blue. And this storyline could have made for a dramatic love triangle (with the gangster played by Lloyd Nolan) if it were better developed and conveyed in the plot. Leo and Ginger's loss of their child is just casually sloughed off for something that should have been more dramatic. The gangster's murder is also ignored and another sharp turn puts the band back on the rails. The film has too much of a slapdash feel.

The scenes dramatizing Jigger's fall into mental illness were excellent, as well as the noir-like setup of several scenes. Overall, this film had a lot of potential that was just ignored. It also seems as if the studio didn't want commit major stars to the film, and the result is a pedestrian handling of material that could have been better.",1224460800,,1461,4.680933852140078
3162411,2,B0016OM3TK,"I had high hopes for this one, especially since the reviews were good and Warners made some great films during this period.  I tried my best to like it, but the acting was melodramatic, and script was not very good, and the story not very original.  Obviously, the title song is a classic and the big band music was great, but that wasn't quite enough for me.  The extras are the only reason I'm keeping the movie.",1221091200,,414,4.35064935064935

3162413,5,B0016OM3TK,"Blues in the night is a dynamic edge of the seat Thriller.

I bought it on the recommendations of previous reviewers and I was not dissappointed one bit.

Its in the film Noire catergory... a splendid well put together film that always has you wanting more, its cast of actors, where from the old school
who later in years became legendary leads in their business... but even in these earlier movies . they all had superb screen charisma.

The plot is very well scripted, and moves along at a great pace, ducking and diving and all the time giving its actors the chance to display there individual talents... Jack Carson for me is a superb favourite of mine, as too is Howard da Silva... who both went onto huge acclaim as time went by in the movie business.

Lloyd Nolan : he is terrific as always in any situation :he had a chequered career in Hollywood that span 50 years.. and the lead players Boy & Girl...Priscilla Lane very dishy, playing the romantic interest
of both her husband, and the main character player Richard Whorf the crazy mixed up musician  were perfect casting.

Its a story thats got grit... intrigue... and romance... thats a sure fire recipe that would give a movie buff "" The Blues in the Night ""

They just cant make films of this calibre any more... which is a pity.",1219190400,3,1294,4.504273504273504

3162415,5,B0016OM3TK,"This is a very offbeat kind of film that is not well known. You'll either really love it - I do - or you'll not care for it at all. Anatole Litvak, who directed so many womens' pictures, directs this odd little film that starts out as a kind of ""small town band does good"" picture, takes a turn into gangster territory, and then gets really dark with a venture into film noir and mental illness. Nobody in this film was a big name at the time, and I get the feeling it was one of those films that Warner's liked to grind out like sausages in the 30's and 40's that just happened to turn out to be rather special. Great performances are turned in from everyone involved, which includes Priscilla Lane as a good girl with depth, Lloyd Nolan as a gangster with a touch of the entrepreneurial and even a bit of a mentor, Jack Carson as a heel with a large bag of excuses for his behavior, Betty Field as the gangster's moll who aspires to be a singer and also ruins men as a hobby, and Richard Whorf as the musician and bandleader who falls for the moll and also into temporary insanity. Also note that future great director Elia Kazan shows up playing a small part as one of the bandmembers.

Released just three weeks before the beginning of World War II, it provides a snapshot of how the Depression and the era of the gangster were receding into memory just as an age of optimism was beginning that would go on hiatus during the war effort, and restart and peak after the war was over. Great atmosphere and great acting - highly recommended.",1207267200,64,1541,4.313793103448276
3162436,4,B0016OM3TK,"Having seen this film on TCM a few years back there were things about it that stuck with me. Definitely not an MGM film, as much of the action takes place in jail cells, boxcars and roadhouses, more in keeping with a Warner Brothers product, which it is. Not exactly a musical either, this in spite of the fact that music is the focal point of the film. Most of the characters here (incidentally, one of the characters here is actually NAMED Character, lovely Priscilla Lane) are down and out musicians, none of whom have two nickels to rub together most of the time. The lead musician is Jigger (Richard Whorf), a gifted pianist who is also something of a tortured soul, someone who lives for his artistry but tends to make bad decisions, particularly when it comes to women. BLUES IN THE NIGHT possesses a great cast, which includes Jack Carson, Lloyd Nolan, Elia Kazan (yes THAT Elia Kazan), Wallace Ford, Billy Halop (onetime Dead End Kid), Howard Da Silva and Betty Field (as the bad girl who sends Jigger off the rails). There's a lot I like about this film, brisk pace, snappy patter, vivid characters and an earthy lowdown ambiance that lends a noirish flavor to the proceedings. And the music's not bad either.

3162439,5,B0016OM3TK,"This is a very good film about people who love making music in it's raw form, performing live.  They work hard and run into some successes and some troubles.  Tremendous acting by Priscilla Lane and Richard Whorf (who looks amazingly like Victor Mature).  Betty Field is a great ""bad girl"" without over playing the role and Priscilla Lane plays the opposing nice, cute girl, also without overdoing it. The director must have really done a great job working w/ all the actors to get such fine performances.  Many of the roles would have been easy to over play or become parodies of themselves, but they don't allow that to happen.  The storyline isn't complex, but the scenes and characters are so interesting that the plot doesn't need to be complex in order to entertain.  You don't have to be a music fan to like this, but it doesn't hurt.  This is one of my favorite films from this era.",1294876800,4,890,4.559748427672956

3162443,2,B0016OM3TK,"If your taste goes to rosy, thirties-style musicals and, if you don't mind weak cinematic tea, this movie might be palatable.  If you're looking for the black or bluesy, however, this aint no cuppa strong joe.  The cadence, mood, and pace are reminiscent of the happy-go-lucky fare of films featuring the Dead End/East End Kids, of which one of this movie's actors, Billy Halop, indeed portrayed a character.  The protagonist musical troupe has nicknames like Character, Jigger, and Peppi.  They sometimes set up housekeeping in boxcars and emerge as though from a band box.  Even the yard bulls seem to be their buddies.  They're really swell kids, ya see.  They barely earn enough money for food, but they gleefully relinquish it to people like reckless gamblers and hardened robbers, who purportedly probably need it more than they do.  See, all they care about is jazz and each other (to a degree that the viewer could easily construe as unsavory).  They have such a pollyanna attitude that when manipulative harpie Betty Field touches their lives, two of them salivate like Eve at the sight of forbidden fruit.  Field possesses neither great beauty or sensuality and certainly no charm.  She attracts losers and men out for an easy make.  Even bad-guy Lloyd Nolan has soured on her, but the gang wants to make her one of them.  Oh, well.  All will come out in the mix, for the only real danger in this puzzling plot is to those who threaten the sweet cohesion of the merry band.",1247356800,,1483,4.764705882352941
3162444,4,B0016OM3TK,"You can't say too much about the film as it stands in the way of enjoying the ride. I found it slightly askew in the story line and for the better. It is refreshing seeing a different take on what is really only a limited number of plots according to James Cagney. Boy meets girl, boy gets girl, boy loses girl. Boy meets girl, boy doesn't get girl, boy finds another. This one rips at the core of how stupid can be about their life when they give into emotions that blind them to the real world. A world grounded in true happiness and not just the momentary desires of one's self. See it and all this pseudo-crap will make sense.",1245024000,,630,4.214876033057851

This picture screams life with spectacular montages and sweet and lovely playing and singing . The acting's uniformly superb and dynamic . See it if you can friends . See it if you can .",1395446400,3,841,4.569536423841059
