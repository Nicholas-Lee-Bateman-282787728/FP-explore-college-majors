8584261,5,B00CP4S8DK,"Who would have thought a complicated looking animal like a dinosaur would be easy to draw?  Using basic shapes of a circle, rectangle, square and triangle, this DVD of a Day with Dinosaurs make it easy.  It teaches drawing while entertaining children of all ages with fun facts about dinosaurs.  Using animation, education, on site settings, and Mark showing how easy it is, it's the perfect DVD primarily teaching drawing, but also overall entertaining.  There's a good reason as to why it has one so many awards.  My grandchildren loved it!
