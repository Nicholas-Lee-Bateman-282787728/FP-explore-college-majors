Recorded Live at the Universal Amphitheater in Los Angeles in 1986.

The words and music were composed and arranged by L. Ron Hubbard on his Creston ranch where he spent his last years.  The Road To Freedom album, concert and video were released posthumously.

Performers included known musicians and big names like Peter Schless, Frank Stallone, Leif Garrett, Gayle Moran, Chick Corea, Karen Black, Gloria Rusch, Rory Kaplan, John Novello, Lenny Macaluso, Rick Shaw, Ron Moss, Tommy Brechtlein, Jim Cowger, James Grinta, The Golden Era Musicians: Rick Cruzen, Tamia Arbuckle, Charlie Rush, Fernando Gamboa and Ron Miscavige, Celebrity Center Vocal Artists Association with Julia Migenes-Johnson, Michael Roberts, Jeff Pomerantz, Lee Purcell and Misha Segal.

Remarkably, after L. Ron Hubbard's death, a rough demonstration tape was discovered in his desk featuring his a cappella performance of Thank You For Listening.  This recording was fastidiously handled by Golden Era Productions where they remixed it with music.  It is an appropriate coda for the record and this live performance and features a video tribute.

Thank You For Listening is the ONLY musical perfomance EVER recorded of L. Ron Hubbard, and it is from his mid-70s!  If you have listened to any of the Advanced Clinical Courses you might have heard him relate stories of his professional balladeering over the radio in the 30s and 40s.  The Alaskan Radio Experimental Expedition led him to host a time slot on Radio KGBU where he was dubbed the ""Voice of Alaska"".  He would answer questions and then to round out the hour he sang ballads of his own composition.  Singing was part of LRH's life.  He was also perfoming while attending George Washington University in the 30s.  People related to his ballads as they were about real life events of the time.  One of his time slots was later filled by Arthur Godfrey.

The Lyrics for The Road To Freedom are based on key life-enhancing Scientology concepts.
