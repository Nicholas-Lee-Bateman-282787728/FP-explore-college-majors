7815019,5,6301761367,"The nice thing about this 1990 VHS recording is the absence of narration.  All you are getting is all you probably want... live footage of Crosby, Stills and Nash in the studio, on stage, and in sound bites culled from interviews.  The music and the performers tell their own story.  Here's how it all breaks down:
Of the twenty tracks listed, there are eleven complete performances.  `Long Time Gone' opens the tape, live from their 1977 tour.  This track includes some archival shots of the artists from performances not featured on the rest of the tape, and the credits are rolled over it as well.  An acoustic `Marrakesh Express' follows from the 1969 Woodstock Festival.  Next up is an interview/performance with Stephen and David from The Dick Cavett Show in 1969.  Joni Mitchell and others are present as Stephen debuts `4+20' with a miscue in the opening verses (no one notices though as `Deja vu' was yet to be released).  Later in the tape we have `Helplessly Hoping' and `Teach Your Children', two pristine studio performances sans audience.  Further into the tape we have more tracks from the 1977 tour, `Wooden Ships', `To The Last Whale: Critical Mass and Wind On the Water' complete with the large screen video footage of dolphins and whales that supplemented the stage presentation on the tour, `Just a Song Before I Go', `Dark Star' and `Wasted On the Way'.  `Suite: Judy Blue Eyes' can also be considered a complete track, two-thirds of the song drawn from the 1969 Woodstock Festival, spliced together with one-third of the 1989 Bridge School performance.  The best track is the intense `Dark Star', which at one point transforms Stills into a lead-guitarist-whirling-dervish, and the two studio tracks.  All of these recordings are of excellent sound and video quality. Stephen introduces `Wasted On the Way' as an autobiographical song about the band, and the Bridge School (run by Neil Young's wife, Pegi), benefit performance, though quite inspired, reveals that both Stills and Crosby had ascended to a critical mass of poundage by the late 1980's.
There are a number of fine tracks that are incomplete.  Among them are The Byrds lip-synching a black and white `Mr. Tambourine Man' on the Hollywood A-Go-Go television show from 1966, an excellent live `Carrie-Anne' from The Hollies on The Smother's Brother's Show in 1967, and the classic `For What It's Worth' from Buffalo Springfield, also from The Smother's Brothers in 1967.  The Tom Jones Show kicks in a visually and audibly beautiful `You Don't Have To Cry' from 1970, with Dallas Taylor on drums, Greg Reeves on an upright bass, and Neil Young adding a second acoustic guitar, but no vocals. The intro is cut from Neil's `Down By the River', performed by CSN&Y in 1970 for The Music Scene television series.  Perhaps there were some copyright issues with showing these television performances in their entirety, but the 'Cavett' performance somehow made it.  Aside from the hokey Byrds track, fans will certainly want complete copies of the other performances.
There are also snippets from various sources that really don't deserve to be credited as featured songs, most of them running less than a half minute.  We have a home recording of Stephen performing `Black Queen', probably the lowest quality recording on the entire tape, but there is no questioning its historic value.  There is a recording studio segment featuring `Find the Cost Of Freedom', and the tape concludes with a portion of `Carry On', the officially released version, playing while the credits roll.
As noted the tape also features interviews with the band members (and one brief segment with Joni Mitchell) discussing their origins as a band, their conflicts, their thoughts on composing socially relevant music, and their personal integrity as artists.  Obviously if you are a fan of the band this tape is precious.  You simply cannot obtain such a diverse selection of material from the three decades this tape traverses anywhere else.  The only drawback is that so many of the tracks are not presented in their entirety.  The tape will undoubtedly leave fans wanting more from the vault of studio performances and concert recordings.  It would only make sense to release the available material as the CSN fan base is aging out.  Remember, producers... fans can't buy a DVD from their grave, at least not given the limits of today's technology.",1085270400,9,4404,5.0
7815020,5,6301761367,"Perfect overview of the CSN (and sometimes Young) career, in a personal and musical way. very good concert footages from different periodes and very nice interviews with mainly Graham Nash and David Crosby. Their vocal and musical qualities are appearant throughout the tape, as Nash sums it up: ""We are as honest as rock and roll can be, sometimes painfull to watch but thrilling to hear!"" God bless them.",1085011200,2,406,4.898550724637682

After viewing this nice collection of music and hearing their own  words of making music together, I came away feeling like I know so much  more about these story telling legends. It puts a smile on your face as you  watch them play.",940636800,6,387,4.347222222222222
