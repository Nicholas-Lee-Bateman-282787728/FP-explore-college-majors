421038,5,6302053692,"This simple, beautiful cartoon, based on the Russian symphony, is sweet and innocent and can be enjoyed by all ages.  Little Peter goes wolf-hunting with his friends, the cat, the duck, and the bird, and they find him!  The kids will enjoy the animation, you'll like the music...this is a classic!",1024012800,11,297,4.803921568627451
421039,5,6302053692,"This is one of the most endearing and enduring Disney cartoons ever! Serge Prokofieff's timeless music orchestrates the Russian folk tale of little Peter and his ""hunting party"" who go off to trap the big bad wolf. Sterling Holloway's voice is perfect as narrator. Each character in the tale has his/her own theme played by a different orchestral instrument - teaching the viewer to distinguish sounds and themes while enjoying the show.  Warning: As a child (many, many years ago) I found Sonia the Duck's encounter with the snapping, snarling, hungry Wolf much scarier and distressing than Oz's Wicked Witch of the West and her Flying Monkeys - so you might want to pre-view this before showing it to a very young child.
Also included on the video are the cute and funny ""Silly Symphony"" a non-verbal lesson in international harmony and ""Music Land"" featuring favorite Disney cartoon characters.
If you like this video, I recommend you also try the CD ""Heigh-Ho! Mozart.""",1016236800,39,973,4.969325153374233

421117,5,6302053692,"I loved this story since I was a young child. Would listen to it on a vinyl record for hours, over and over. Years ago I found this on VHS.

4) Disney's characterization of the animals is brilliant.

421137,5,6302053692,"Wow I had a hard time finding this origina version!
As a gramma, I'd like my four Grandchildren to experience
the older stories! I was telling my 8 yr old g.s. about how the music
Is used to tell this story! Each instrument is easily connected
To the character. I had him guessing about what he would choose
Or expect to hear.  Fun for both of us.  Then Iwent looking and couldn't find much.
Some of the newer versions are very dark and scary .... Great for adults.
Once I got this used copy, I told my son!  He has planned to make it a special family night
Date to see it together.  Thank you for this service,

421151,5,6302053692,"This is a very old story, set to music by Prokofiev. It was adapted by Disney as one of ten segments of the animated feature film, ""Make Mine Music"" in 1946. Narrated by Sterling Holloway (the voice of Pooh) it is the story of a young boy who goes with his pet cat Ivan, duck Sonia, and bird Sasha to catch the wolf. The music has always been a popular way to teach people the value of classical music, and how music can be expressive and teach a story. Each animal and person in the story is expressed by a musical instrument, such as Peter by a string quartet, Grandpa by the bassoon, and the hunters by kettledrums. The piece is hilarious and very well animated. It was edited into a short featurette for the first time in 1955.
Also appears on the Make Mine Music DVD.",1257379200,,772,4.258503401360544

421155,5,6302053692,"This is an awesome film.  The musical score, narration and animation blend together beautifully in telling Prokofiev's classic story.  My only warning is that some parts of the film are quite frightening.  Unless you know they won't get overly scared, I wouldn't recommend showing this to your kids until they're at least 8.  I first saw it when I was 5-ish, and the wolf absolutely terrified me.  Afterwards, if anyone did so much as hum the music from the film, I'd freak out.  I'm 18 and I still haven't totally gotten over it.  So just use good judgement when showing this to young children.  Otherwise, its fantastic.",1163203200,6,622,4.747663551401869
