Socialism was practiced in all indigenous societies, but when colonies were formed by the northern powers, the land was given to the rulers of the colonial countries. Currently, more than the land is taken by the wealthy societies, but also the jobs.
I agree with Chavez.",1369526400,3,355,4.836065573770492
8240393,5,B00114XM2M,"While Americans did focus on the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina during the disaster, little has been told about the aftermath.

Alex Lemay's ""Desert Bayou"" is a real look at why Hurricane Katrina will go down in history as the worst natural disaster ever to hit an American city. Lemay focuses the documentary on Salt Lake City, where 600 evacuees were sent without their consent after Hurricane Katrina. The film tells the story of two families sent to live at the abandoned Camp Williams National Guard base in the outskirts of Salt Lake City, a state who's population is 1% black.

Desert Bayou will wake you up to the reality of this devastating disaster. This is a film I highly recommend. It's a very important part of American history that cannot be lost.",1199404800,2,768,4.8106060606060606
