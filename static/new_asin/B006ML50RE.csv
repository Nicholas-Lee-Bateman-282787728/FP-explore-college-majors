5005795,5,B006ML50RE,"Criterion, who probably makes more film fans happier than any other company, has just released David Lean Directs Noel Coward.  An odd pairing, at first glance---the man who directed such epics as Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago and The Bridge on the River Kwai---with the premier light comedy actor/author/composer of the twentieth century. Even odder is the choice of material: A world class war story about the sinking of a ship; a world class romance about lost love; a world class picture of the British lower-middle class; and the world class comedy fantasy of the last century, respectively In Which We Serve, Brief Encounter, This Happy Breed and Blithe Spirit. Perhaps even more surprising is that all four were made during a period of about three years, from 1942 to 1945.
  Briefly, all four films are extraordinary examples of propaganda at its best. Lean and Coward were both fervently patriotic, and England was the underdog at the time in a war.  Lean was just beginning his astonishing career; Coward had just finished a dozen or so years of incredible success on the stage, but considerably less success, or even attempts, at a film career. In 1941, Germany bombed London for 57 consecutive evenings.
  Coward wrote and Lean directed these films, with Coward playing the lead for In Which We Serve. Coward also produced, wrote the screenplay, composed the score, and officially codirected, though he handed the reigns to Lean in his directorial debut.
  Coward was entertaining the troops during the shooting of the other three films, yet his mark is clearly visible in each films. The cameraman for the quartet was Ronald Neame, perhaps less a household name, yet later the director such gems as The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, I Could Go on Singing and The Horse's Mouth.
  In Which We Serve is the story of a ship, sunk off the coast of Crete during the war.  Based on incidences in the life of Coward's great friend Lord Louis Mountbatten, flashbacks tell the story of the few remaining survivors, clinging to a lifeboat, waiting for rescue.  In lesser hands, this narrative technique would be worse than banal, but the creators, relying so very strongly on flashbacks, allow the audience to see war through the eyes of the women left at home, waiting, not knowing when or if their sons, husbands or boyfriends will return.
  Brief Encounter is based on a slight one-act play Coward wrote for Tonight at 8:30 entitled Still Life.  A man and a woman, both more or less happily married to other people, meet quite by accident in a train station.  To the overused strains of Rachmaninoff, they fall hopelessly, helplessly and enormously in lover. Again, in lesser hands, this stiff-upper-lip-do-the-right-thing sort of drama could be cloying and irritating, but the moral quandary this couple feels somehow slips into the audience's brain, and the horrible realization that although love is usually just nifty, it can cause extraordinary heartache and pain. Parenthetically, Andre Previn has just turned this text into an opera.
  This Happy Breed, an ordinary story about an ordinary family living an ordinary life just before the war, grabs the audience with its specificity and universality, until the ordinary becomes extraordinary, and the small pains and pleasures of everyday life insinuates into the audience's psyche. Based on an early play of Coward and drawing on his own lower-middle class background, the triumph here is really Robert Newton and Celia Johnson as the father and mother experiencing the trials and triumphs of everyday life.
  The final film, Blithe Spirit, is perhaps the most well known. Rex Harrison stars as an author, re-married after the death of his first wife, hiring psychic Margaret Rutherford to perform a sance so he can learn the lingo of the telepathic trade for his new book.  Alas, Madame Arcarti, Rutherford's character, somewhat ineptly brings back the ghost of his first wife, with hilarity and confusion ensuing.
  Criterion's restruck prints are wonderful, the extras are pretty astounding, with the complete South Bank show on Coward and some lovely interviews with author and critic Barry Day who has made Coward very much something of his own cottage industry. Day resembles someone who might be in an unexpurgated Alice in Wonderland, but has that fuzzy British charm which can be so endearing.  All in all, we owe a deep debt of gratitude to Criterion.
  Now, if we could get them to clean up and release the nearly unavailable films Coward acted in,  such as The Scoundrel, The Astonished Heart, and perhaps even the television version of Blithe Spirit?",1333411200,36,4628,5.015686274509804
5005796,5,B006ML50RE,"The Criterion Collection has released DAVID LEAN DIRECTS NOEL COWARD, a four-disc boxed set containing the quartet of films that the two artists made together during the first half of 1940s.  The collection is being released in both Blu-Ray and DVD editions.  This reviewer's remarks are based on the DVD set.

All four films, two of which are in Technicolor,  have been magnificently remastered.  The colors are brilliant and balanced; the black-and-white images sharp and solid.

I'm not going to use much space talking about the individual movies, since anybody who decides to purchase this collection will, undoubtedly, be well familiar with them.

IN WHICH WE SERVE (1942) was co-directed by Coward and Lean and deals with a ship of the Royal Navy, sunk in the Mediterranean during the early days of World War II.  This event occurs at the start of the picture, thus most of the narrative is told via flashback as the survivors cling to a life raft, being strafed by German planes while they await rescue.

Coward plays the ship's captain, and we follow his story, as well as the histories of several crew members.  Among the cast in this stirring film, nominated for a Best Picture Oscar,are John Mills, Bernard Miles, Celia Johnson, Kay Walsh, Michael Wilding and Richard Attenborough.

THIS HAPPY BREED (1944) is the story of an average middle class British family seen over a period of twenty years, from the end of The Great War to just before the beginning of World War II.  It is a tale of the vicissitudes of life.

The Technicolor film stars Robert Newton, Celia Johnson, John Mills, Kay Walsh and Stanley Holloway.

BLITHE SPIRIT (1945), also in color, is a sparkling comedy about a man (Rex Harrison) who must explain to his present wife (Kay Hammond) why his late wife (Constance Cummings) has decided to haunt them.  Margaret Rutherford plays the wacky medium who has brought the poor fellow's problems about.  The players are all in top form.  A delightful fantasy, adapted from Coward's popular stage play.

BRIEF ENCOUNTER  (1945) is one of the finest romantic films ever produced, an absorbing love story, adapted from Coward's play, STILL LIFE.

The plot is very simple.  Married doctor Trevor Howard and suburban housewife Celia Johnson happen to meet on a train platform and enter into a quietly passionate, ultimately, doomed, love affair.

This collection includes a fabulous cornucopia of extras.  Among them are new interviews on all the films with Noel Coward scholar Barry Day, a 2010 interview with cinematographer/screenwriter/producer  Ronald Neame, documentaries on the making of IN WHICH WE SERVE and BRIEF ENCOUNTER, a 1971 television documentary on David Lean, a 1969 audio conversation between Coward and Richard Attenborough, a 1992 British television show about the life and career of Coward and much more, including a 46 page booklet filled with essays about the various movies and the talented men who made them.

5005797,4,B006ML50RE,"""I want too much."" ""I hate living here. I hate living in a house that is exactly like hundreds of other houses.""  ""And, what's more, I know why I hate it; because it is all so common."" So says Kay Walsh as Queenie Gibbons to her father in ""This Happy Breed."" To which he responds: ""One of these days when you know a bit more, you will find out that there are worse things than being just ordinary and respectable and living the way you've been brought up to live."" ""We don't like doing things quickly in this country,"" Robert Newton's Frank Gibbons explains later. ""It's like gardening. Somebody once said we were a nation of gardeners. They weren't far wrong. We like planting things and watching them grow.  It suits us alright. It always will."" ""It's up to us ordinary people to keep things steady."" And that's what Mr. Newton and Celia Johnson (who plays the wife and mother herein) so effectively accomplish herein, as we watch their lives evolve in an ordinary row house in anywhere Britain between 1919 and 1939.

Is there anyone there, is there anyone there? One rap for yes, 2 raps for no. So asks Margaret Rutherford's eccentric representation in Coward's ""Blithe Spirit.""  Unfortunately for Rex Harrison, somebody is there; his ex-wife, or rather her ghost.  But he instigated it himself and then has to deal with the consequences in the lively word and sentence fest that is ""Blithe Spirit,"" in large measure (like This Happy Breed) still a stage play albeit filmed for the screen.

1940s wartime Britain is also represented herein, particularly when that island stood alone. That is a hard mood to capture, but ""In Which We Serve"" succeeds herein. It presents the gravity of the era (1939-1941) in which it was shot (1942) in almost real time; when Britain was hanging on precariously as the Royal Navy kept it afloat, so to speak. Showing bravery, British mettle, and presenting British resistance against Hitler's Nazism is patriotic sure, but this is a British film, made from a British perspective, made during the war. ""In which we Serve"" is consequently a film which captures an era well & for anyone who wants to understand the British perspective of that era (viscerally even) one would be well served by giving it some of your time.

Self-respect and decency, or rather the fight to uphold them against the wind, against happenstance and simply time is also the subject of ""Brief Encounter."" We get Celia Johnson again, this time to battle the notions of decency and carry ""Brief Encounter"" with almost just the expressions and countenance of her face.  Sentences like this, though, also help: ""She talked and talked and talked. I wanted to strangle her. Still she meant to be kind. Isn't it awful about people meaning to be kind.""

Comedy, love, romance and the stiff upper lip of the happy breed that makes Britain great and makes the British Navy what it is are all here thanks to Noel Coward. These films accomplish what so many films fail to---reflect the era in which they were made (or the era that they are supposed to represent), and far from being horribly dated, still resonate.

This Happy Breed shows us  an idealized family living in England from 1919 to 1939.  This film ends at the start of World War II.  Blithe Spirt has some great actors in it-only one problem.

5005808,3,B006ML50RE,"Criterion's massive (4 disc) DAVID LEAN DIRECTS NOEL COWARD
is a worthy addition to anyone's art film collection.  These four films are very early
Lean, when he began his association with Noel Coward.  I must admit
I purchased this mainly because I wanted to see IN WHICH WE SERVE,
an excellent film about British naval warfare: a very workmanlike
piece of cinema).  BLITHE SPIRIT was a surprise: with
its lush, almost over-ripe color, it seemed somehow sinister, ably contributed to by
the cynical performance of Rex Harrison's dead first wife (Kay Hammond).
THIS HAPPY BREED, a slight tale of Brit life, was a revelation:
a much subdued Robert Newton spark as the head of household,
""seeing it through"" as times changed.  And finally, there was BRIEF
ENCOUNTER which I'd never seen, but had been led to believe,
over the years, was a devastating emotionally-wrenching romance
of two people who chance to meet and ""fall in love"" at a railway station.
Well, sorry folks: I found this worthy of Woody Allen's Academy
of the Over-rated.  Celia Johnson stands out as the tempted wife;
but why she would fall for a wooden Trevor Howard is beyond me.
(I kept seeing him as Captain Bligh!)
(Then again, I once fell instantaneously into and out of ""love""
at a train station myself, so...)

Criterion's usual quality impresses.  I thought the color for BLITHE SPIRIT
strange, but it fits.)  Nice supplementary features on
each disc.  Lean's association with Coward certainly gave him
experience for his next classics GREAT EXPECTATIONS and
OLIVER TWIST which deservedly belong in any collection.

Quite well priced.  (And I enjoyed seeing a surprisingly
trim and approachable Noel Coward spending most of IN WHICH WE SERVE clinging to
a lifeboat.)  Try it.",1353801600,8,1748,4.989655172413793

5005812,5,B006ML50RE,"he Criterion Collection's release of ""David Lean Directs Noel Coward"" is possibly one of the most exciting box sets that I have been wanting to see in America for quite some time.

A legendary playwright, writer, filmmaker, actor, you name it...Noel Coward has probably done it.  And it's one thing that has made fans of his work so appreciative of this individual is because he brings so much life into his work.

As for David Lean, he's already considered a legendary filmmaker.  From directing ""Lawrence of Arabia"", ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"", ""A Passage to India"", ""Doctor Zhivago"" to name a few...  Both Noel Coward and David Lean are legendary for their highly acclaimed work in their oeuvre.

But you go further back to when David Lean first became a filmmaker, it's because of Noel Coward, he was given the opportunity.

For both men, it would begin during World War II.  Noel Coward who wanted to do something for the British public during the war and the fact that he was raised with a grandfather who was a Captain of the Royal Navy, Coward so much wanted to do something during wartime.  Having worked with British Intelligence, there was no doubt that Coward wanted to do more.

And that opportunity would come in 1942 with the release of his British patriotic (and propaganda) film ""In Which We Serve"".  The film would feature Noel Coward as a lead actor but since he is a man that was only focused on directing certain parts of the film and action wasn't his forte, what best than to bring highly regarded editor David Lean.  David Lean got his first opportunity to co-direct the film with Noel Coward and both managed to create a film that was well-liked, praised very well not just in Britain but also in the United States and it earned Coward an Academy Award for ""Outstanding Production Achievement).

And this would be the beginning of the working relationship between Noel Coward and David Lean (there is also a third man included in this and that is cinematographer Ronald Neame).

The two would once again reunite for ""This Happy Breed"".  A film adaptation based on Noel Coward's 1939 play and for those who were enamored with Noel Coward's 1933 film ""Cavalcade"" (directed by Frank Lloyd) about an upperclass British family from 1899 through 1933 (which covered the family through the Second Boer War, the death of Queen Victoria, the sinking of the Titanic and World War I), ""This Happy Breed"" would feature on a working class British family during 1919 through 1939.

As Coward was busy with his plays at the time, it gave David Lean the opportunity to direct his first solo film.  ""This Happy Breed"" would also give Lean the chance to work (and experiment) with three-strip Technicolor and once again, the reception was favorable for this second collaboration.

The third collaboration between David Lean and Noel Coward was not as smooth as the first two films.  Noel Coward wanted his comedy ""Blithe Spirit"" to become a film and David Lean, known as a serious person was reluctant in directing a comedy. While the film at the time was criticized for a film about ""death"" (or deceased love ones reappearing as ghosts), not many were wanting to see a film about that subject matter while many were dying during World War II.

Needless to say, both men have differing opinions on both films but both agreed that they should work again for another, more realistic film and that would ""Brief Encounter"".

The film would captivate audiences as it would win the Grand Prize, the ""Palme d'Or"" at the 1946 Cannes Film Festival.  The film would also earn Celia Johnson an Academy Award nomination for ""Best Actress"".  Recognized as one of the top 100 British Films of All Time (#2 in the British Film Institute Poll), ""Brief Encounter"" would solidify David Lean's filmmaking career (Noel Coward was already well-known worldwide).

And this popularity would lead David Lean to work on Charles Dickens' ""Great Expectations"" and ""Oliver Twist"" and many other well-known films for the next three decades.  But the popularity gained from ""Brief Encounter"" would lead both David Lean and Noel Coward to bigger things and the film would be their Magnum opus and their final collaboration together.

These four beloved films would receive new restoration in 2008 courtesy of BFI National Archives and in 2012, receive a special high definition remastering for Blu-ray release.

The Criterion Collection will be releasing these four films as part of the ""David Lean Directs Noel Coward"" Blu-ray and DVD Box Sets featuring many special features paying tribute to Noel Coward and also David Lean but most of all, paying tribute to their collaboration for these four films.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""In Which We Serve"" is presented in a brand new high-definition digital transfer courtesy of the BFI (British Film Institute) National Archive's 2008 restoration. With that being said, because this film has been restored, if you want the best version of this film to date, you definitely want to pick up the Blu-ray release of the ""David Lean Directs Noel Coward"" box set.

As for the DVD, ""In Which We Serve"" is featured in black and white (1:37:1 aspect ratio) and for a film that was created back in 1942, this 70-year-old film looks absolutely fantastic on DVD.  Grain is noticeable, contrast is wonderful. Black levels are nice and deep, whites/grays are vibrant and clear but I can only imagine how much sharper and pronounced the quality is in HD via Blu-ray.

As for the picture quality, according to Criterion, the picture has been slightly windowboxed (for the DVD version) to ensure the maximum image is visible on all monitors. The new restoration was created in 4K resolution on an Oxberry 6400 liquidgate scanner at Cineric, New York, from the original nitrate negative and sections of the nitrate fine-gran master.

""This Happy Breed"" is presented in a brand new high-definition digital transfer courtesy of the BFI (British Film Institute) National Archive's 2008 restoration. With that being said, because this film has been restored, if you want the best version of this film to date, you definitely want to pick up the Blu-ray release of the ""David Lean Directs Noel Coward"" box set.

As for the DVD, ""This Happy Breed"" is presented in technicolor (1:37:1 aspect ratio).  It's important to note that while this film was shot in three-strip Technicolor, director David Lean did not want this film too look like a standard Technicolor film.

""Blithe Spirit"" is presented in a brand new high-definition digital transfer of the BFI National Archive's 2008 restoration. With that being said, because this film has been restored, if you want the best version of this film to date, you definitely want to pick up the Blu-ray release of the ""David Lean Directs Noel Coward"" box set.

As for the DVD, ""Blithe Spirit"" is presented in technicolor (1:37:1 aspect ratio). It's important to note that the film was shot in Technicolor.  Picture quality for an early Technicolor film is very good.  There are some specks that do show up a few times but for the most part, for something this old, it looks rather good on DVD and no film warping or any major blemishes.

As for the audio, the audio is presented in Monaural.

According to the Criterion Collection, the monaural soundtrack was restored from a sound print made from the original nitrate track negative. Click, thumps, hiss and hum were manually removed using Pro Tools HD. Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.

English subtitles are presented in English SDH.

JUDGMENT CALL:

There is no doubt that fans of Noel Coward and David Lean have been highly anticipating the ""David Lean Directs Noel Coward"" box set release.

These four films look absolutely incredible thanks to the restoration effort by BFI National Archive and watching these films today, no matter if they are over 70-years old they look fantastic.  And if it's one thing to look so great on DVD, I believe that the Blu-ray release of the ""David Lean Directs Noel Coward"" box set is fantastic.

But video and audio quality aside, the reason why I enjoyed this box set is because not only do you get four magnificent films but with each disc down to the booklet, the entire set pays its respect to both Noel Coward and David Lean.

From Barry Day's insightful knowledge to the collaboration of both men, to documentaries featuring both men, interviews with cinematographer Ronald Neame who worked on all four films and many other special features included, the ""David Lean Directs Noel Coward"" is the definitive collection for any cineaste who enjoyed these four films.

5005813,5,B006ML50RE,"I purchased the ""David Lean Directs Noel Coward"" set mainly because it included Blithe Spirit which has been unavailable on DVD or Blu-Ray. It is a very funny comedy and just as good as I remembered. Margaret Rutherford is priceless as the medium.

The set also includes the not very well known This Happy Breed and also the very famous Brief Encounter, both excellent.

But for me the revelation was how great a film In Which We Serve is. It is certainly one of the best WWII films ever.

The Special Features include wonderful interviews with Noel Coward that are as entertaining as they are informative about the films and how they were made.",1335571200,3,645,4.640350877192983
5005814,5,B006ML50RE,"These four David Lean/Noel Coward films are definately worth the upgrade from the non-remastered editions.  The color in ""This Happy Breed"" and ""Blithe Spirit"" is especially a big improvement from earlier editions.  It's well worth the price!",1335398400,4,242,5.513513513513513
5005815,5,B006ML50RE,"I have been waiting for this set (particularly This Happy Breed and Blythe Spirit which were out of print) for a very long time.  This wonderful set (I have the DVD, NOT Blu-ray) does not disappoint.  As stated by two other reviewers, the remastering is gorgeous.  This Happy Breed was rather a shock, in fact, as I have a very old VHS copy, taped from TV which is not bad for what it is, but rather faded and dusty looking.  Again, as stated by others, the extras are very fine... intelligent, informative and the commentary by Bruce Eder on Brief Enounter is almost like taking a seminar in Lean and Coward and actually touches on the other films as well.  If you are interested in these films at all, don't miss this beautifully done set!",1334188800,4,741,4.45925925925926
5005816,4,B006ML50RE,"In comparing this to the Image Entertainment version, the colors and details are more vibrant, but it still has the look of having been mastered off of a 16mm print. The film ""sparkles"" throughout. This is probably the best they could do within costs, but it would have been nice to have had a CGI enhanced version that would bring it up to the quality of when it was first issued.",1334188800,,381,4.380281690140845

8501033,5,B006ML50RE,"I found this group of movies great to watch. In Which We Serve, The Happy Breed, and Brief Encounter were all astounding pictures that touched me deeply. Each film is full of feeling and none were tearjerkers. In Which We Serve follows the story of sailors on a lifeboat after their ship has sunk. I witnessed the simple life of the sailors and their families. There is no jingoism in their stories. These are people who love, get married, party, quarrel, and simply go to war because it is their duty. I find it amazing that the film can present to us the internal turmoil of these sailors without having to show too many graphic details about the brutality of war. We don't see it. We experience it through the anxiety of sailors missing home, wives awaiting sailors, and occasional losses. Although the Happy Breed is between wars, I also felt the same way about it. This time it focuses on the lives in one simple working class family readjusting to society after WWI. Husband and wife, a spinster aunt, the nagging mother, two daughters and a son. While the Gibbons see their children get married, lose a son to an auto accident, see a sister become a spiritualist, and their daughter run away with a married man because she can't tolerate their poverty, important historical events in English history during this period evolve into what will be WWII. Many of these events are hints of what is to come. This second film is done in beautiful technicolor, but it isn't the Hollywood technicolor. The color is more like the one I enjoy from The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp, Black Narcissus, and The Red Shoes by Powell & Pressburger which is quite beautiful. Brief Encounters, which I had seen already is also another great romantic film of a couple who come close to adultery. Once they see the danger, the married man makes the decision of moving far away. This one is set in black and white that resembles a noirish atmosphere. The film I didn't like much was Blithe Spirit. Also done with the same technicolor technique seen in The Happy Breed, this story concerns an author who invites a spiritualist to conduct a seance in his home to see if he can get some good ideas for his next book. This story takes a wild turn when the seance has brought to the author's home the spirit of his first wife. The movie wasn't boring, but it didn't awaken my interest in it. I did enjoy the presence of Margaret Rutherford as the medium Madame Arcati. She was quite hilarious in her role. I thought she was the most refreshing presence in this movie.",1500422400,,2548,4.565502183406114
8501034,5,B006ML50RE,"This is an edited, updated review of Blithe Spirit only.  The reason is, I bought this set of four movies because I've searched endlessly for a copy of Blithe Spirit that included subtitles, mainly because I've never been able to understand everything Rex Harrison says in his weirdly incomprehensible British accents.  I get most of the other actors' dialogue, and I already know exactly what happens anyway, but I still wanted a copy with subtitles.  The reason I'm making such a big deal is, the product details state that all four movies are subtitled, but when you play them, there is no subtitle menu on the screen, and the subtitles do not appear.  HOWEVER -- I was just informed by a very helpful viewer that there are in fact subtitles.  If you press the subtitle button on your DVD remote control, they will appear (on mine, a menu pops up, you select on or off).  I'm very indebted to that viewer.  I love Blithe Spirit.  It's a wonderful Noel Coward play, and the movie is just as good (although you can quibble about the different endings).  This was the first ""grown-up"" play I ever saw, performed by a university theater group, and it remains one of my favorites.  And now that I know how to expose the subtitles, I can actually enjoy it.",1499299200,5,1253,4.57847533632287
