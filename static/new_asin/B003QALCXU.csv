8402235,1,B003QALCXU,Let me start off by stating that I am not a fan of Joe E. Brown so that greatly influences my review. I had considered purchasing this DVD - as it is a pre-code- but am so glad that I did not. The pre-code stuff is cute but the rest of the film is beyond lame.,1469750400,,260,3.6607142857142856
8402236,5,B003QALCXU,I love Joe E Brown & his films. They're fantastic,1439683200,,49,4.0
8402237,3,B003QALCXU,OK but not as good as some of his other films,1421971200,,45,3.1818181818181817
8402238,3,B003QALCXU,"Only one song survives in this film, which apparently was made as a musical, but were mostly removed because of changing tastes.
The film therefore is a little strange with musical comedy stars doing comedy without much music.
However it is still very watchable with Joe E  Brown and Winnie Lightner working well together in this wrestling story from WARNER Studios..",1356048000,,367,5.016393442622951
8402239,5,B003QALCXU,"It seems strange that anyone would make a movie musical about wrestling. Thus, the music was jettisoned (with the exception of one song). What remains is an energetic comedy that shows off comedian Joe E. Brown's athletic prowess at a health sanitarium. Naturally, Joe gives off some of his trademark yells, which are always good for a laugh. And the film is climaxed with hapless Joe having to fight some ""wrestler's kid brother""--which turns out to be gorilla--until the calvary arrives to save him.
A fun & funny Joe E. Brown vehicle!",1349568000,2,537,4.8478260869565215
