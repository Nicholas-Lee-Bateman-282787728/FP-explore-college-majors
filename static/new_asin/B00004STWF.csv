I use to watch this cartoon all the time when I was a child. I loved seeing all the good monsters battle and stuff. I liked how they looked like animals of our world just not the same. The story was really good but also super cute too. I really do miss this Cartoon so much but I seen all of it.",1343520000,,414,3.8823529411764706
7922034,5,B00004STWF,I absolutely love this show! Anyone who is into anime should definetly see it! All the monsters are sooo cool!,1081987200,,110,4.55
7922035,5,B00004STWF,"i really like this show.  i haven't seen it in a long time, but it is one of the best shows aimed for a younger audience that i've seen.  monster rancher may not interest those who are way into the major bloody fight seens, but it is perfect for the younger viewers out there.",1081209600,,276,4.092592592592593
7922036,5,B00004STWF,"Monster Rancher, yet another Pokemon/Digimon clone?  Not hardly.  Monster Rancher stands by itself and isn't a clone of anything.  Genki wins a contest and gets a new game for his PlayStation in the mail.  He plays the game to watch a girl and a monster run away from the Black Dino troops.  She enters a shrine (although, the game calls it a ""ruined temple"") and unlocks a disk.  Instead of unlocking a monster, Genki is pulled into the weird world and makes friends with Holly and her monster!
I haven't heard of the Monster Rancher video game until I saw the series. I watched it on TV...but soon lost track of it.",1047772800,2,617,4.464285714285714
7922037,4,B00004STWF,"I must say, I originally thought this series would be yet another Pokmon/Digimon clone.  I was wrong.  This series teaches the fundamentals friendship along with the obvious good versus evil.  The best part about Monster Rancher is that is actually a 'closed' story line with a great conclusion.  Not all of the episodes are available for purchase yet, but they are worth collecting.",1019606400,3,383,5.031746031746032
7922038,5,B00004STWF,"Okay, so mabye this show *IS* like Pokemon and Digimon combined, but like  those other shows, it starts out the same go's on a compleatly different  and fun plot!  Plus I think it should be noted that this is the first show  that actually shows the Playstation in it!
1. In The Begining (5/5)
In  this episode we find out that Genki wins a special CD-ROM from a  ""Monster Battle"" contest (This WAS called something else in  Japan) at the beginning of the show!  But for some reason this CD-ROM disk  pulls him into the game!  To make matters worse, he came at a point where  Moe (The bad guy) is capturing goodies (Good guys) and turning them into  baddies (Bad guys)!  But the funny thing is, no one know why!  Later  durning a mystery disk transfer (The unlocking of whatever monster was  trapped in that thing) one of the dino guys says that Moe will find his old  body!!!  Not alot, but we at least something to get us to watch episode  two.  After unlocking Mocchi from the mystery disk ours hero's travel to  the next adventure!  Not bad for the first episode!
2. I'm Mocchi  (4/5)
Not to much happens in this episode.  Genki and the others find an  old couple living outside the forrest in a cabin.  Feeling tired and hungry  they ask if they could stay for the night.  The couple really love Mocchi  (And Mocchi loves them) and spend all night with him playing!  They explain  how they never had a chance to have children with the war that's been going  on, so they treat monsters as if they were their children!  The next day  the gang go to the temple to unlock another monster and decide as a thank  you to the couple, they give the monster to them to take care of!
3.  Guardian Of The Disks (5/5)
The gang stumble upon a garden with nothing  but mystery disks!  Problem is that they're all dead mystery disks because  they were killed by Moo and his men!  But the guardian of the disks Golem  tells them if someone were to find the Phonix (I don't know if I'm spelling  that right) all these disks would dissapear, and all the monsters would be  restored into good healthy monsters!  But the garden gets attacked and  Golem must defend the place!  After defeating the dino's Golem decides to  go with Genki and the others!
Over all not bad!  The story doesn't really  start to pick up till later on in the show, but this is a great show  none-the-less!  Highly recomended!",969062400,10,2384,4.377880184331797
7922039,5,B00004STWF,"But it's still a terrific DVD.  A young human boy from Earth (Genki) is transformed to another world.  In Digimon, humans are ""digitized"" into a digital world.  Genki travels with another human, Holly, and a bunch  of monsters.  In Pokemon, Ash travels with humans and his ""poket  monsters"".  In Digimon, the humans travel with their Digimons.  In  Digimon, they fight evil.  In Monster Ranger, they fight the evil Moo.  Monster Ranger monsters do not transform like Digimon or evolve like  Pokemon, but they are stored in ""mystery disks"" and converted to  monsters at a shrine.  Pokemon monsters are stored in Pokeballs.  I don't  see how you can't make the comparison to the other ""Mons"".  Sure  it's another ""Mon"" type show, but it's different enough and fun  enough to make any seven year old happy to watch it.  Mine enjoys the show.",960854400,5,838,4.808510638297872
