2731014,5,B000MGBLFK,"I love Drew Carey.  He is a Class Act and is a comedic genius.  His show, replete with a top notch group of highly talented and VERY funny people makes me laugh until it HURTS!  I can't wait until this comes out on DVD - talk about a treat.  If you want good, honest comedy and just plain fun, Drew Carey's the one you want to see.

You might also want to check out ""Cleveland Rocks"" and his funny spoof, ""Geppetto.""  You will be wiping tears of laughter out of your eyes!",1121644800,7,472,4.076086956521739

2731066,5,B000MGBLFK,Someone had mentioned that the video quality was horrible... I honestly don't know what they were talking about. My copy looks just fine. It's certainly no HD transfer. But it isn't pixelated at all. I wonder if its got something to do with your DVD player / tv resolution.,1499990400,,273,4.591836734693878
2731067,5,B000MGBLFK,I think this is one of the funniest shows that used to be on tv.  This is how it all started.,1497830400,,93,3.4285714285714284

2731097,1,B000MGBLFK,why buy season one when no other season is available. People buy either one season at a  time until they get them all or they buy a boxed set. Not to sell any more seasons of a very funny show is stupid and an apparent loss of a great chance to make money. I am not buying season one because it is an unfinished series without the rest and I'll spend my money on shows where you can get all the seasons.,1482451200,2,403,3.9146341463414633

2731167,5,B000MGBLFK,"I watch this show in syndication every chance I get! There is a not a single episode I've seen that hasn't been funny. It never faltered even, towards the end of the series. The cast is amazing and the back and forth between the characters is hilarious.",1473811200,,253,4.404255319148936
2731168,5,B000MGBLFK,Such a fantastic show. It's a shame there arent. more seasons available.,1473724800,,72,5.083333333333333
2731169,5,B000MGBLFK,Drew Carey's show is a fast paced nonstop ride on the Ha-Ha train. The show is a gattling gun barrage of one liners from the cast members and they are outrageous  almost every second of the show. Drew Carey has been described in the past as a human cartoon  and he truly is. Each cast member is a parody in their selves. This is Carey's  baby because  his name appears  as being one of the creators and it shows in the show's handling of the comedy. A laugh out loud  and entertaining  show.,1473724800,,491,4.21505376344086
2731170,5,B000MGBLFK,"Several of the jokes are straight from Drew's stand-up comedy performances.  During the show, a few of the jokes really didn't fit the scene - they were just trying insert jokes wherever they could.  With that said, I love this show!  The show matures to be much better but this is still a good episode.",1473465600,,303,4.472727272727273
2731171,5,B000MGBLFK,The absolute best. Highly recommend. Still cannot understand why they never produced the rest of the series. One of my all time favorite shows.,1473379200,,143,5.0

2731183,5,B000MGBLFK,"My favorite comedy series of all times are: The Drew Carey Show and the Mary Tyler More Show. I am happy to be able to see the first year's episodes of the Drew Carey Show on the internet (I didn't find about them when they were on TV until Season 3). It is really funny how the main character copes with the zany personalities in his life. Thank you, Amazon!",1469232000,,359,4.142857142857143

The good, solid shows that may not be megahits but are popular are being shoved aside and forgotten, like this one. I really miss this show and I hope that one of these days I will see the rest of the seasons on DVD, and then I'll be able to buy the set.",1446854400,,422,4.096385542168675

2731260,2,B000MGBLFK,ok,1438041600,,2,2.0
2731261,5,B000MGBLFK,"Great show with a fantastic cast, that will have you laughing non-stop with each episode! There is such chemistry between all of the characters that not only are they entertaining, but we care about them as people, with whom we can identify in terms of situations we all face on a daily basis. The jokes are hilarious and the interaction between the characters Drew and Mimi will have you rolling on the floor! I will echo what most if not all of the other reviewers have stated: WHERE ARE THE REMAINING SEASONS????????????? It would be a crime if the other eight seasons were not released! What are they waiting for! I know season one left me wanting more! Wish I could give the show more than five stars!",1437350400,,706,4.5234375
2731262,5,B000MGBLFK,"I was a huge fan of this show when it was on TV, I'd completely forgotten Moon Over Parma was the theme song for the original season.  The original season of course shows the viewer how Mimi came to become Drew's arch nemeses at Winfred-Lauder after Mimi applies for a job in the beauty department.  In the extras it's interesting how we learn Mimi was supposed to just be there for that one episode (the pilot) to give that episode's plot a reason for Drew to not give someone a job that would still make him come across as a nice guy, we also learn from the actors who play Lewis and Oswald that they think it was her character that spread word amongst viewers and made the show popular.

The first season of course doesn't have Mr Wick in it, instead Drew has a boss who apart from being seen when dressed as Santa, we never see him at all, and just hear his voice until we see him in the final episode where he makes a joke about it.  Similar sort of ongoing gag to the Howard's mum in the Big Bang Theory, the neighbour in Home Improvement.  There aren't any extras that explain why this was done unfortunately. As the season episodes get higher, no doubt to the show becoming more and more popular, there are more special guest actors such as for example Tim Allen hanging from a tree and Jamie Lee Curtis as Drew's hairdresser who Drew asks out.  Like all older shows it's always interesting to see actors in minor roles that went onto to become much more successful such as the waitress in this one (Megyn Price) who would of course become one of the main stars of Rules of Engagement.

Most of the iconic memories you have of this show are probably from later seasons but season one has some big memory episodes such as Drew is made the personal assistant to the elderly Mrs Lauder where of course Oswald casually mentions he might be required to service the old gal. Drew also has a girlfriend for most of this season, well sort of that he can't ever really hang out with her, due to a workplace rule that management can't date store underlings.  Kate and the other store employees go on strike in one episode, of course Drew is part of management and on the opposite side.  We see inside Mimi's house and what's inside a cupboard in another.  Drew and Mimi even team up against a common enemy in one episode we're Kate and Oswald walk in on them in Drew's kitchen saying something like ""well Drew we were going to ask you if you wanted to come drinking but I can see you two have already started"".

I think this show was more believable than most that the characters were lifelong friends, especially Kate with the guys. Sometimes good shows like Seinfeld for example, Elaine didn't really come across as plausible as only being friends with the guys, you wondered why she didn't hang out with other people.  Whereas Kate, you believed that she'd grown up with them and didn't need or want any other friends.  All the characters have flaws and are very likeable people, even Mimi to some extent for a villain was really only giving back what Drew gave her.",1437177600,,3067,4.416666666666667
2731263,5,B000MGBLFK,"The Drew Carey show is the funniest and most heart warming show I have ever seen.

They are excellent DVD's. I was a fan of the Drew Carey show myself. I thought it was really funny and enjoyed the cast. There was one thing that bothered me, though. It was when the woman, who worked with Drew, would constantly make fun of his weight, even though she was obese herself. That never made any sense to me. But I didn't buy it for me. So that is kind of a moot point.

The seller shipped the DVD's quickly.  I like the way Amazon has it set up to put in addresses so you can choose who to send gifts to rather than having to add the information each time you buy a gift for someone. It makes a transaction quick and easy.",1424649600,2,714,4.014084507042254

2731305,5,B000MGBLFK,"5 Stars for the Show and Drew Carey!, but 1 star for the video rendering. This is the worst transfer I've ever seen. It isn't even SD (480i), looks to be somewhere in the 300's. It's as if they pointed a video camera to a TV set. Some episodes are better than others, but I'm really shocked about how poor the resolution is. I have quite a collection of 60's - 90's TV shows on DVD, and this is the worst I've seen. Warner really dropped the bomb on this one. Glad I only paid $9.99 for it. What a shame Warner didn't want to invest a little more is such a classic show. I still love watching it, but the video is of bootleg quality (actually, I take that back, I've seen some bootlegs that are better quality than this).
P.S.:  Just to make sure I didn't get a set from a ""bad batch"", I purchased an episode from iTunes, downloaded it and watched it, and yes, it's the same poor resolution as the DVD (however, it looks great on small screens like your iPhone or iPad).",1422489600,5,970,4.159574468085107

The show itself is about this Dudley Do-Right guy Drew Carey.  He works for a big department store in Cleveland.  He is tortured by Mimi, this (ahem....) large overly made up woman who has a desk directly behind Drew.  He has a core of 3 friends, who are with him through thick and thin.  Drew drinks beer, shoots pool in his backyard, fights with his red-neck over the top neighbors, pursues a girlfriend he can't officially date (he's management, she's works for the store), and has an interesting life.

God forbid that a Cleveland show outshines a New York show (because New York is soooooooooooo important!). It is clear that The Drew Carey Show got brick-walled from syndication and into any kind of media release (so far, only Season 1 on DVD has been released). I know most of you will vote for ""Seinfeld"" only because it is splashed all over TV re-runs to this day and released in several media formats (however, not on Blu-Ray or UltraViolet/Digital download). But to appreciate The Drew Carey Show and its wacky characters, you must be able to see it. Apparently, we cannot do that. Why? Again Cleveland gets snubbed.",1388880000,2,780,4.916666666666667

2731404,5,B000MGBLFK,"I first watched the Drew Carey show from the beginning episode back in 1995.  The first season is the only one so far released on DVD, and it is great!  Never content with being just another sitcom about working class buddies, the Drew Carey Show pushed the bounds of humor and occasionally good taste in its nine seasons on ABC.

The original opening music, ""Moon Over Parma"", is the only opening music in this season, and brings back fond memories every time I see it.  This season introduces the whole gang, and Drew's nemesis and foil, Mimi Bobeck, in the office working for Drew's boss.  Drew's frustration with his almost meaningless job, troubles dating, and his attempts to claw his way up the corporate ladder provide much of the humor, but his friends Kate (who has dating troubles of her own), Oswald (who just gets odder as the show goes on) and Lewis (who may be criminally insane...or not) all have their share of the spotlight.

A three episode arc in the middle of the season has Drew and his employer being sued for sexual harassment over a funny cartoon.  As is often the case, he's his own worst enemy in the run-up to his day in court, but throughout it's funny, very very funny.  Look for Penn and Teller as weaselly attorneys in the second ep of the arc.  Watch any episode of this season, and you should find yourself laughing loud and hard, and looking forward to the next episode on the disc.

Most pilot episodes look like a work in progress, and don't always hit the mark.  The pilot for The Drew Carey Show is both hilarious and consistent with later episodes.  The cast already has chemistry, and honestly are the kind of people I'd love to hang out with at a tavern just like the Warsaw that is their watering hole.

Bottom line is that this is one hilarious show.  If you're easily offended, watch a couple of episodes, and  you'll probably get over it.  Excellent inaugural season, and the ones that followed were also very good for the most part.  This is before the epic musical numbers that made their way into the show, or before the contest episodes.

Can't wait for Season Two!  Hope it won't be much longer...",1373760000,,2148,4.532467532467533

2731406,5,B000MGBLFK,"When this series was on, it was one of my favorite sitcoms of all time. So unique, stunning killer one liners, improv comics not only doing there lines but doing their own. This was a tremendously entertaining show. For this show to be hidden for so long, politics MUST be involved at the corporate level. Hugely successful, the actors in this series went on individually as well. (Just watch Scrubs, Cougar Town, Whose Line Is It Anyway, Price Is Right and others). In my area, the reruns have disappeared.

For the price? It is a no brainer.

In my opinion, this show racks up there with all the greats, and the show kept on getting better every year. Yet the only episodes available are the first season and a compilation. A shame. With all the other TV crap that is out there only a week after a show is cancelled, there is nothing on this show?

The first season is a thrill to watch..watching the show develop and the characters get to knw each other better, what works, etc. I still laugh watching the one liners and insults between Mimi and Drew, (""your makeup looks like the backside of a Mandrill"").

It was at one time one of the best shows on TV and the some of the jokes and pranks they had on that show were awesome!

I order this on a wednesday and got it by the weekend which was great because I did not add on any special delivery options. The condition of the case was perfect so I am glad that I did not have to deal with any return issues.

If you have never seen this show, it is very funny. The first season doesn't really show just what those actors were capable of doing because they were still getting used to the show itself but by the middle of their run, it was just one great joke after the next.

Drew himself pretty much remains the same as he does throughout the series, but others, especially Mimi (Kathy Kinney), evolve.  The series focuses on life of the working stiffs who live for the weekend and work at dead end jobs.  The pilot episode finds Mimi applying for a job in the cosmetic section and although she has some heavy application of eye shadow, her character isn't as garish both fashion wise and cosmetic wise as she would become.  She accuses Drew of discrimination and calls him a pig which would become a staple of the series.  Drew eventually gives the job to his best friend Kate (Christa Miller) and the series is set in motion.  Other notable differences in the first season is that there is no Mr. Wick, the store manager is an unseen Mr. Bell (voiced by Kevin Pollock) who torments Drew via intercom.  Lewis (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald (Dietrich Bader) are along as Drew's friends.  Buzz Beer doesn't make it's debut until the final episode, but it will become an integral part of the show.

I am disappointed that many shows are coming out in thin-packs as of late, although the packaging is nice for certain shows. For some reason, when I first heard that this show was coming to DVD I figured it would be in thin-packs. Not sure why.

Anyway, the colors on the box look great. It suits the show without being too flashy. On the other side, it's not too cheesy (like the Charmed DVD covers). There are 2 thin packs, each with 2 discs.

The front and back art for the individual thin packs has episode descriptions along with a couple stills from the episodes. Inside the thin pack is a picture of the cast along with cast listing and which actor plays which character.

The actual DVD's each have a picture of one of the main cast... except Mimi. Overall then, the box, discs, and thin packs are pretty decent looking

MATERIAL/QUALITY

The audio and video look pretty decent. It's definitely better than broadcast, but nothing special. I suppose it's just as good looking as any other sitcom.

The menus are nice, part of the theme song plays over them. There is a play all feature, or you can pick whichever episode you want.

The retrospective video was better than I expected, but I didn't expect much. It's nearly 20 minutes and recaps how the show came into being, how the characters came about and how they developed. I figured there'd have been maybe a 5 minute conversation between Drew and a couple of the other actors, so it was a nice surprise to see this show get this kind of retrospective.

I'm glad this show was finally released. It's strange that it took so long, and it's nice to see that they didn't just slop together a release in order to appease the fans. It seems as if the studio actually cares about the release, which is nice in these days where lots of shows get chopped up, music gets screwed, the video is left alone (on older shows).

2731529,4,B000MGBLFK,"Comedian Drew Carey shows the ups and downs of middle-management in the long-running ABC comedy sitcom ""The Drew Carey Show"". Lovable loser Drew Carey (Himself) lives his middle-life years in Cleveland, Ohio as the mild-mannered assistant director of personnel of the multinational department store chain Winfred-Louder. Drew spends much of his days dealing with his cranky cosmetics-challenged co-worker Mimi (Kathy Kinney) and hanging out with his close friends Kate (Christa Miller), Oswald (Diedrich Bader) and Lewis (Ryan Stiles) in the local tavern. ""The Drew Carey Show"" is the very funny comedy sitcom that debuted on the ABC network in the fall of 1995. The first season features some amusing episodes with a terrific comic cast and side-splitting laughs. Adult viewers might relate to the characters mid-life issues. The onscreen rivalry between Carey and Kinney is utterly hilarious. The first season of ""The Drew Carey Show"" also includes Kevin Pollack (The Usual Suspects) as Drew's sexist and unseen boss Mr. Bell, and guest appearances by David Cross, Tim Allen, Jamie Lee Curtis and Penn & Teller.

Experience again all the laughs from one of the funniest comedy shows in recent television history with ""The Drew Carey Show: The Complete First Season"". All 22 episodes of the first season are presented in their original full screen format. The picture quality is quite good and certainly sharper than your average television rebroadcast. Its 2.0 Dolby Digital audio is well balanced and rather enjoyable. The only extras in the 4-disc set are the 19-minute ""Life inside a Cubicle"" featurette and the ""1-900-Mimi"" parody. Though somewhat weak compared to other television DVD box sets, ""The Drew Carey Show: The Complete First Season"" offers hours of enjoyment and earns a ""B"".",1177027200,5,1793,5.291228070175438

2731531,5,B000MGBLFK,"The premise of an everyday guy living a lifestyle that the majority of people can identify with is the soul of the show. Drew has a job with no educational requirement that anyone could have, he has morals, good friends and the typical circumstantial and personal adversaries that everyone has in one form or another. It's what we all have been through or are currently going through and it offers a view of all this that lets us know that you can only take life seriously to a certain extent without requiring some sort of medication or therapy.

This review is not so much about specific episodes as it is a synopsis of the show from it's beginnings to it's untimely demise. I can honestly say that I found enjoyment and laughter in every single episode and I look forward to buying all the seasons for this show.

I'd like to see some outtakes and cast interviews added to future releases. The cast was a great combination of people who were as funny off the set as they were on. Personally, I feel Ryan Stiles has a lot of room to grow from this series and show creators/producers/writers are missing the boat on this highly talented comedian (as long as they don't write him into a box; his creativity would be an asset to any script) and what he could do for their show(s).

While I'm on it, there should be a show that brings Ryan and a couple other incredibly talented individuals from ""Whose Line"", namely Collin Mochrie and Brad Sherwood, together in their own sitcom. I believe, with the right sitcom/script, that they could definitely have the next top comedy since The Drew Carey Show. The improvisational possibilities would be outrageous.

Other shows that have shown similar qualities since Drew Carey are ""Two and a Half Men"" and ""Scrubs"". If you liked The Drew Carey Show, these would be welcomed additions to your sitcom DVD library.",1175731200,14,1852,4.637195121951219

""I [would have] wanted to have some crummy, white-collar-type job where I COULD be in charge, but I'm not,"" Carey said.

Although unfulfilled professionally, Drew is sustained by his longstanding friendship with pals Oswald (Diedrich Bader), Lewis (Ryan Stiles), and Kate (Christa Miller). While the four pals all find humor in being losers - a fact typically pointed out by Drew's cosmetics-challenged co-worker/arch enemy Mimi (Kathy Kinney) - only Drew cares about getting ahead on the job, but his prospects are few and fleeting.

Like the rest of us, according to producer Bruce Helford, Drew's trying to juggle a life and a career and get through the day with a bit of dignity left.

It's good to see the show finally packaged in a season set DVD release. Hopefully, the first of many to come.

The Drew Carey Show - The Complete First Season is a 4-disc (489 min.) set featuring all 22 episodes in Full Frame (1.33:1) video, plus the following Special Features: ""1-900-MIMI"" and ""Life Inside a Cubicle"" featurette.

Episodes include:
1. ""Pilot""
Between best friend Kate and hostile Mimi (who threatens to go to his boss), pressure to fill a cosmetics-counter job has Drew a shade irascible.

2. ""Miss Right""
Drew finally finds ""Miss Right"" (Katy Selverstone), only to discover she's also just right for the window-dresser job he's trying to fill.

3. ""The Joining of Two Unlike Elements Is a Mixture""
Drew vows to throw Kate a surprise shotgun wedding after she laments that one of the few states she never entered was that of holy matrimony.

4. ""Nature Abhors a Vacuum""
When Drew fires his boss's inamorata, Mr. Bell (voice of Kevin Pollak) forces him to employ all his resources to find him a new girlfriend. Unfortunately Kate is the only other woman who rings Bell's chimes.

5. ""No Two Things in Nature Are Exactly Alike""
Drew's painted into a corner when a female co-worker misconstrues an off-color cartoon he distributed at work and files a lawsuit against him.

6. ""Drew Meets Lawyers""

2731547,5,B000MGBLFK,"....with this show! I am living in Germany at the moment and I watched the show every single day when I lived in the U.S., and even taped most of the episodes so I could watch them over and over again! I loved it so much and was so disappointed when we went overseas and I couldn't see it anymore (I moved right before the finale) and now it's FINALLY out on DVD and I can have it - I am so happy!

I quickly lost interest in most popular television shows because the humor was very fake and forced. This show is about your average every-man and a kaleidescope of hilarious friends and colorful nemesis, and all the ""adventures"" they go through together. I have yet to meet someone who has actually sat through a full episode of this show and not adored it; everyone finds the humor fresh, unique, and very real. Oftentimes they will have outtakes from the episode playing during the credits (although I'm not sure if they do in the first season) and you can see that even the actors can't get through it without laughing - everything is SO funny and enjoyable!

This show is also more than great laughs. The casting is also genius: you can't help but love Drew Carey because it is all too easy to relate to his problems and sense of humor - a very un-romanticized portrait of what it means to have a mundane job! His buddies Lewis (Ryan Stiles) and Oswald (Diedrick Bader) brilliantly adopt silly, idiotic characters with charm and perfect comedic timing. Mimi (Kathy Kinney) is his rival - and don't judge a book by its cover! She is a ruthlessly funny enemy who gets the biggest kick out of playing pranks on Drew; or as she calls him, ""the pig."" Her excessive makeup and outlandish clothing only add to the hilarity of her character. As for HUGE super-fans of Mr. Wick (Drew's second boss who stays for the remainder of the show's run) don't despair - he isn't in the first season, but he arrives in the very second episode of the following season. He is fantastic as well.

Fans, please buy this show so the rest of the seasons come out all the quicker! Non-fans, check it out - you will NOT be disappointed!",1169856000,7,2113,4.398976982097187

2731549,5,B000MGBLFK,"I was 15 years old when The Drew Carey Show debuted. I laughed my butt off watching that show for about 6 or 7 years. I always made time on Wednesday night to watch this show. I even watched the syndicated reruns every day for quite some time. The first few seasons of this show were hilarious, but the show slightly went downhill and got carried away with goofy promotions like their April Fools ""Spot the goofs"" episodes.

Drew Carey works as a middle-management drone (officially assistant director of personnel, a job he would never escape) at a Cleveland department store. He is harrassed by his unseen boss, Mr. Bell (Kevin Pollak, hilarious dialogue only heard on intercom). He keeps his sanity at home with his three friends Kate (Christa Miller), Lewis (Ryan Stiles), and Oswald Harvey (last name learned in a future season played by Diedrich Bader). You could see these actors really put in a lot to their character. Numerous times over the course of the series, you sometimes see them ready to lose it and laugh only to keep it together. Drew, who feels his job can't get any worse, gets stuck with a co-worker from Hades named Mimi Bobek (Kathy Kinney). Please be advised that Craig Ferguson, the actor who plays Mr. Wick, is not part of the cast in season 1. I found his character unappealing, but since Kevin Pollak probably didn't realize the show would be the hit it would become, he probably opted out of future seasons. You finally see him in the flesh, although I can't remember if it was in season 1 or early in season 2.

This set is an easy recommendation from me being a huge fan of the series. For more comedy, also check out my Men Behaving Badly review. I give this DVD the full 5 stars, even with the few extras.",1169769600,3,1739,4.517460317460317

for some its a classic cd...others a movie...a book  etc

Well this is my 1 and probably only review and i only do this because this show to me deserves to be recognised

ill keep it as short as possible

Where im from (London) the british televison network is more or less garbage showing only the primetime (BAREABLE) american shows (friends, dawsons etc) yawn

Fed up with the 5 Channels uk tv has to offer (yes u guys in US 5 channels!!) i purchased cable and found this little show called the drew carey show (season 1).

If it helps i was 19 at that time (Audience)

The Drew Carey Show twists the irony and sarcasim of evryday life into comedy.

Drew is a 35+ year old man in a middle management dead end job

hes overweight, unlucky with women, never gets his promotion and has dumb/trailer park type friends.

Its was running 1995 - 2004 a whole nine seasons.

Scrubs is more or less an evolved version of The Drew Carey Show, with its witty/borderline comedy/drama (to add

to this the actress that plays perrys wife in scrubs was originally in the first 8 seasons of TDCS but left for scrubs).

Only recently due to the magic of the internet (hint ""rents"" Hint) have i managed to watch all 9 years of drew carey.

It is a crime that its not on DVD at the moment and its even bigger crime it didn't get the fame it deserves.

i went throught all the motions watching this series its a very versitile/flexable one at that.

It was a privilage watching this series and although i personally don't like buying tv series on dvd (just movues) i feel i owe the cast and creators for making such a well rounded comedy/drama.

If i haven't yet sold this series out to whoevers reading this let me just add this last statement.

This is one of them series that when you finally see it you will

most definetly say

""where the hell was i when this was on tv

I guarantee it

One for the ages catch an ep if u can

2731552,5,B000MGBLFK,"What's WRONG with you people! Don't you reconize a funny, smart, brilliant, over-the-top hilarous TV show when you see one?! I can't believe people praise ""Seinfeld"" for being inventive and revolutionary when this show kicks it's A*S!

Jerry Seinfeld is about as funny as a bag of toenail clippings! The Drew Carey Show blows Seinfeld out of the water, and then some! Everyone on this show is hilarous, and it's not a comedy all of the time. Sometimes there's drama when Drew has just been dumped by a women, or when he loses his job, or any of the miscellanious things life throws at us. Here's info about the show and the characters you're going to love and relate to:

Drew Allison Carey (Drew Carey) - The protagonist. Forty-something assistant director of personnel at a department store in Cleveland. He's very much the lovable loser, though it should be noted that he's the most successful of his group of friends. Original founder and owner of Buzz Beer (a special brew the gang makes containing coffee and beer. The brewery is in Drew's garage). A perpetual ""nice guy."" Has a long-standing feud with Mimi Bobeck, aspects of which include: Destroying Mimi's clothes, shredding her vacation requests and masquerading as Antonio Banderas to taunt her.

Lewis Kiniski (Ryan Stiles) - Forms a double-act with Oswald. Lewis is the tall, lanky, blond, insane one. Lewis can be counted on to nonchalantly say bizarre and offensive things. He possesses an IQ of 180. He's a janitor in his forties that works for a company called DrugCo. He notes in one episode that due to accidentally releasing a virus into the population he was busted down to janitor from a position that required he wear a labcoat. It's uncertain if he was a scientist or lab assistant, though it's possible he was joking. At one point he posed as Drew to take his physical for him, and inadvertently ended up taking a psychiatric exam as well. The results showed him to mentally unstable, possibly criminally insane.

Oswald Lee Harvey (Diedrich Bader) - Lewis's slightly shorter, dark-haired friend, is the dumb one of the double-act. That tends to be his only distinguishing characteristic. Lewis described him once as a ""man-child stuck in a state of prolonged adolescence."" At one point he was training to be a nurse, but he proved unsuitable. Oswald was a deejay in the first season, but later he became a delivery driver for Global Parcel (a UPS ripoff made for the show).

Kate O'Brien (Christa Miller) - Friends with Drew, Lewis and Oswald since they were kids. Kate's main characteristic is that she's a bit of a tramp, and a hothead. She and Oswald almost got married at one point, but she called it off just after Oswald threw her a surprise wedding (essentially leaving Oswald at the altar). Kate found out about Drew's long-standing crush on her at their high school reunion, and realized that she had feelings for him too. They dated for a season (even becoming engaged), but broke up when they disagreed about having kids. Drew and Kate were married for a short time in a later season, although this was illegal, as Drew had just become married to his old girlfriend Nicki. Eventually, Drew's sham was discovered and Kate felt incredibly betrayed. It took Drew a long time, but he eventually regained Kate's trust and they went back to being friends. Kate left at the begining of the eighth season, marrying a Marine and moving out of Cleveland.

Nigel Wick (Craig Ferguson) - Drew's boss after the first season, replacing the never-seen Mr. Bell. Crude, boisterous and offensive. He was also a cocaine addict before he was forced to go into rehab. Wick dominated every scene he was in and was the focal point of the show for a while. For some time, he and Drew were in a homosexual marriage (technically a civil union) in order for Mr. Wick to get his Green Card and Drew to get his job back. When he first appeared on stage in guest episodes in the last two seasons he was greeted with thunderous applause. Wick always had unusual methods of firing employees (and always fired someone named Johnson.)

Mimi Bobeck (Kathy Kinney) - Mr. Bell's, later Mr. Wick's, assistant. She is an overweight woman who wears a lot of make-up. However she has very high self-esteem and is Drew's arch-nemesis. Mimi vowed to make Drew's life a living hell after Drew denied her a job based on her makeup. Mimi's pranks included gluing Drew's hand to a porno magazine, covering Drew's desk with garbage and eventually sending Drew to China. Her character can be seen as an attack on societal norms of beauty, much as the main character of Rosalie Goes Shopping is. Later on she becomes more of a friend to Drew (they agree to put their feud on hold while Mimi dates/marries Steve) and a good, if unconventional, mother to Gus.

Steve Carey (John Carrol Lynch) - Drew's crossdressing brother. He came to Cleveland and got a job in the cosmetics department in the same store Drew works at. He falls in love with Mimi and they eventually get married. In later seasons the concept of Steve being a crossdresser is abandoned entirely with little explanation (though it is hinted that he gave it up to make Mimi happy). He leaves, along with Kate and Wick, during the early seventh season.

Kellie Newmark (Cynthia Watros) - An old friend of Drew's from high-school. She was a housewife who was left by her husband. When Drew met up with her again she was working as a stripper. She took Kate's place on the show, but the character was much different. Kellie was probably the only genuinely nice person on the show, and was horrified at many of the goings-on that our characters had come to take for granted. She was also the only liberal character on the show, the others either being libertarian (as is Drew Carey), South Park Republican, or completely oblivious to the world of politics.

The Drew Carey Show ran for nine years. Like many shows with long runs, the show's run can be broken down into several generally-agreed upon ""eras"".

""Moon Over Parma""/Chemistry Titles Era (1995-1996)

The first season of The Drew Carey Show was significantly different from the rest of the series. Drew and Mimi worked under a Mr. Bell, who existed only as a voice on Drew's speakerphone. Other characters who appeared exclusively in this era were Drew's hillbilly neighbor Jules and his family. Drew's first girlfriend Lisa was introduced in this season, though she stayed with the cast for the early episodes of the next season. Many of the episode titles were related to chemistry in some way. No explanation for this was ever given, and the tradition was abandoned at the end of the season. Buzz Beer, beer that had caffeine and tasted like coffee, was invented by the main characters in the last episode of the first season. The concept stayed with the series until the very end.

Wick Era (1996-2002)

The second season was notably different from the first. The opening theme ""Moon Over Parma"" was replaced by ""Five O'Clock World"" by The Vogues, which itself was later replaced with ""Cleveland Rocks"" by The Presidents of the United States of America. This also introduced the concept of the music video-like opening as the cast danced and sang around the various sets of the show. In the first episode Mr. Bell was fired, in the second episode he was replaced by Nigel Wick. Nigel Wick was one of the show's most outrageous characters. Like Lewis he had a tendency to slip truly bizarre or patently offensive things into casual conversation. Nigel Wick, however, was nowhere near as staid as Lewis. Nigel Wick was probably the first British character to appear on an American sitcom who wasn't an upper-class, refined stiff. That is, he was crude, boisterous and offensive.

Lisa and Drew moved in together early in the second season, but it didn't work out. But this allowed the introduction of Speedy, Drew's dog who stayed throughout the end of the series. Steve, Drew's cross-dressing brother, was introduced during this period. He quickly fell in love with Mimi and they had a child, Gus.

Drew was promoted several times, taking away Wick's job. However Wick always managed to return and take Drew's job back from him. At the end of this era Wick and Drew were co-managers of the Winfred Louder department store. Drew was also fired once, but got his job back by ""marrying"" Wick in Vermont, allowing him to get his green card. This was also the era in which series regular Kate and Drew got romantically involved. They were on the verge of getting married, but they called it off when they realized they didn't feel the same about the prospect of children.

This era of the show is generally considered to be the show's best era, and the most recognizable. This era of the show was also known for its special events episodes. Virtually every season had two such episodes: ""What's Wrong With This Episode?"" and ""Drew Live"". The first contained a large number of mistakes, the person who could compile the largest list and phone them in would win a prize. The second was a live show that was recorded four-times over for each time zone, heavily featuring cast members from ""Whose Line is it Anyway?"" because of their improvisational skill. There was also the season 5 finale ""A Very Special Drew"" in which the cast indulged in manipulative and syrupy melodrama in an attempt to get an Emmy nomination.

By far the most extreme was the Drew Carey's Back-to-School Rock 'n' Roll Comedy Hour which was shown a few weeks before the first episode of the 2001 season. The show was a series of sketches which was far closer in content and tone to Saturday Night Live or MADtv than The Drew Carey Show.

Neverending Store Era (2002-2004)

In the fall of 2002 the show returned, but it had become obvious to the producers that the formula was wearing thin. The concept of Winfred Louder and the characters' jobs there was abandoned completely. Show openings alternated with remixes of the previous theme songs, credits, and logo, however the opening was still a montage of various moments from past seasons of the show. The new concept involves Drew getting a job at the company that rented the building occupied by Winfred Louder, an internet start-up department store called ""Neverending Store"". Mimi gets a job as well, and Mr. Wick gets the only job he's qualified for -- janitor. However, Wick stopped appearing all together after a few episodes; Steve was also phased out in the same way. The most notable change, however, was when Kate O'Brien, one of the show's main cast, left. She was quickly replaced with Kellie, an old high school friend of Drew's who had been working as a stripper.

Drew's bosses were a set of twenty-something internet geeks. The combination of high intelligence, low social skills, and hacker naivete created a very different sort of humor for the show. However they weren't the main focus. Like in the first season, Drew's life outside the office took center-stage once again.

Tony The Bus-Driver became a main fixture, appearing in virtually every episode of the last two seasons. He typically played a role similar to a smart-alecky bartender that Drew could tell his problems to. (One of the first lines he uttered in the series: ""There's only one reason a man doesn't want to go home at the end of the day: ugly children."")

In the eighth season Drew decided that he would get married a year from the date he set; a day which would coincide with the last episode of the season. Drew wouldn't make the deadline, but he would realize in the process that he was in love with Kellie. The eighth season was put in a dead timeslot on Monday nights. It was yanked mid-season and the remaining episodes were shown during the summer. In what was almost assuredly a unique event, ABC was forced to finance a ninth season, even though they had effectively canceled the show. The ninth season did not show during the fall of 2003, but ended up getting shown in the summer of 2004.

Drew's last season felt very different from the rest of the show. ABC left the cast and crew alone as they made the season, since it seemed they never intended to show it. The directors started experimenting with one-camera set-ups, showing that the sets were completely built, there actually were fourth walls in most rooms, and the rooms were actually linked together. The writers were equally brazen, as they had Gus burn down Mimi's house, forcing her to move in with Drew. Drew and Mimi's mutual hatred of each other finally vanished and they became true friends.

The season ended with Drew getting Wick's help to open up a department store, using the vacated building that Neverending Store left behind. However, Drew is quickly kicked out of his job as store manager by Wick, who has been given his job by the project's sole investor: his father-in-law. Mimi is also relieved of her vice-presidency and made Mr. Wick's assistant, Drew becomes the assistant director of personnel. Drew goes and sits at his desk, the surroundings are now the same as the Winfred Louder set that hadn't been seen for two years, and Barry Manilow's ""Looks Like We Made It"" starts up.

The actual final episode follows as Drew and Kellie's first child is born, scant moments after the two are married. The final scene is Drew playing pool on his backyard pool table in the rain; the same scene that ended the first episode. He looks up at the camera and thanks the audience, saying it has been fun. The series ends with a montage set to ""You Can Still Rock in America"".
