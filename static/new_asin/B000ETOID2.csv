2533584,5,B000ETOID2,"As a Mother of four children I have searched out many developmental DVD's and ""The Baby Society"" is a real winner and one of my children's favourites!  My 10 month old daughter loves the music and is totally engaged in the DVD.  My older children (2 1/2, 6 & 8) always stop to watch ""The Baby Society"" when it's on and take great delight in trying to have the baby repeat the words on the screen.

All in all, I would highly recommend this DVD!",1153699200,3,444,4.2
2533585,5,B000ETOID2,"It seems the professional speech therapist that put together this dvd took great care to make sure it would not only be very entertaining for your child but also give that child a head start in developing outstanding language and speech skills. My three year old watched the dvd several times when she was younger and both my wife and I are so surprised at the high level of expression she delivers through her speech, using a much more sophisticated vocabulary at such a young age. Currently my 3 month old daughter loves to watch it. We will look for great things from her as well! I highly recommend this dvd for your own children and as a gift to any expectant mother.",1152489600,4,672,4.471544715447155
2533586,5,B000ETOID2,"I purchased this DVD for several friends with babies as well as for my daughters in home day care.  All the children that watch the video love it. Compared to the other baby videos that are out there, this one is our favorite.",1152403200,2,226,4.255813953488372
2533587,5,B000ETOID2,"What a delight to finally find a language based DVD for babies and children! As a former special education teacher and counselor I am always in search of quality products that can educate and interact with my children.  First, the music is wonderful, playful, and soothing.  I can actually listen to it over and over.  Second, babies can listen and practice their emergent language skills with common phrases like; Ready, Set, Go;  Good Morning;  Bye, Bye;  All Gone;  Up/Down etc...  Lastly, the developer has included language guides and tips for parents to use with their babies.  How wondeful!  This has become our favorite video in the family.  My three and five year old will also watch it with our baby and like to repeat the words to him.  I can't wait to see what this specialist comes up with next! Definitely a must buy!",1149724800,3,831,4.694444444444445
2533588,5,B000ETOID2,"We LOVE the dvd ""The Baby Society"". Our 18 month old daughter is mezmorized by the variety of animals toys and images. She always reacts with laughter and sounds as she tries to interact with kittens, ducks, cute wooden pull toys and stuffed animals on the screen. Everything is familiar to her, so I feel it really holds her interest. The music is perfect(not annoying to parents) and seems like it was made for each scene. It has a really simple, sweet feel to it, too.

It is such a joy to see and hear my daughter's reactions and sounds as she watches her favorite dvd and tries to imitate. As a nurse and mother, it makes me feel so good to know that it's actually teaching and  language development each time she watches it. What a joy!! I also really like the fact that the dvd is made to be interactive with parents and babies!! There are tips for parents to use while watching with their child. This video has become my new standard baby gift for all my expectant friends!!",1144281600,3,982,4.3901098901098905
8114079,2,B000ETOID2,"After reading all the overwhelmingly positive reviews on this product, I went ahead and purchased this DVD.  Another factor that convinced me to try the product was the fact that a speech/language pathologist was involved in its production.  I agree with Daddy T, that Baby Society is practically identical to the Baby Einstein DVDs.  My 13-month-old babies were totally bored with it.  What HAS piqued their interest and spurred language growth are the Baby Signing Time DVDs.  I highly recommend those instead by a hundred fold!

8114080,5,B000ETOID2,"My husband and I really love the Baby Society. The DVD is very sweet, simple and soothing. We initially borrowed the dvd from a neighbor who's son really loves it, so we purchased our own and our 1 and a half year old daughter watches every minute of it! It reminds us of a board book or a ""See & Say"", the way the animal or object is shown & then has some really nice sound effects and music. It seems to make our daughter want to name the animal or object! We think that this is better than anything else we've seen for babies and it's not overstimulating at all. Our daughter LOVES the animals, baby and toys This would be great for a baby between 5 months and 2 years. Buy this one for sure!",1204588800,,695,4.08029197080292
8114081,5,B000ETOID2,This is a wonderful DVD. It held my 6 month old son's attention. He really seemed to love it!! It seems to be really well thought out and designed. I think what makes this so good is that it doesn't seem to be over produced. I hope that they make more of these. Great Product!! Keep up the good work!!,1203638400,,301,4.033333333333333
8114082,5,B000ETOID2,"I love this DVD. It's far superior to anything else like it - I've tried a lot of them, including Baby Einstein. This wonderful DVD held my infant son's attention, as well as my 3 year-old's. Whoever made this product should make another one - she really knew what she was doing. It really targets the proper components of language development and in a way that's entertaining for young ones. If you're looking for something to help your child who has a language disorder, or for something that's educational for anyone I highly recommend this product.",1197849600,,552,4.760416666666667
8114083,2,B000ETOID2,"Very surprised to see so many high ratings for this video.  The video says for 3-36 month olds.  I would say 3-12 month olds is more appropriate.  Additionally, I don't see much difference between this video and the Baby Einstein collection.  A little more focus on vocabulary, but still a lot of distracting images.  If your child is having speech delays, based on other peoples reviews I guess its worth forking over the $19.99 to see if it is of some help.  Otherwise don't bother.",1196467200,,484,4.635294117647059
8114084,5,B000ETOID2,"I received this DVD as a gift from one of my day care mothers.  I have many educational type DVD/videos to choose from, but when given a choice, the children in my day care choose this DVD over the others.  They love the music and anticipate the changing scenes. clapping when their favorite ones appear.  Highly recommended.",1196208000,,325,4.666666666666667
8114085,5,B000ETOID2,"I have a three year old daughter who has loved this DVD since she was a baby. When she watched it she reacted with giggles and smiles.  I now have a 4 1/2 month old baby who reacts in much same way as my daughter did, and the bonus is my daughter has fallen in love with it all over again. She always shouts ""what's next, what's next"" and laughs out loud when the scenes change.  I've played this DVD during playdates and have found it to be totally irresistable to babies of different ages and diverse temperments.  You will enjoy watching your child/ren learn from this simply and sweetly crafted gem.",1184976000,,603,4.366071428571429
8114086,5,B000ETOID2,"I received this video from a friend for my 14 month old who has a language delay.  I was skeptical that he would even watch it because we've tried other baby videos and they didn't hold his attention.  I was amazed at how captivated he was from the very beginning.  He sat with me and watched the entire thing!  Several times the video had him cracking up, clapping his hands in excitement, and signing for ""more.""

This video is genius, in my opinon. Many of the videos that we've seen are down right annoying to adults and my children didn't care for them either. I was plesantly surprised at how much I enjoyed watching the video too!  The music is awesome!  I don't know who wrote the music but I have never heard any of it before, it wasn't the typical classical music you hear in every kid video. My 5 year old was very delayed in his speech as a toddler and I wish we would have had this video for him back then.

I am going to start giving this video as a baby shower gift.  I think all children will benefit from it and really enjoy it, not just children with a speech delay.",1173225600,2,1084,4.1980676328502415
8114087,5,B000ETOID2,"I recently purchased this DVD for my two boys, aged 3 and a half and 16 months. My 3-year old has a moderate expressive and receptive language delay, so I was looking for something to help improve his vocabulary and language skills. This DVD is wonderful...it teaches short phrases and single words, has beautiful scenes and music, and the voice over is a very friendly and soothing voice. Both of my boys were instantly captivated, and admittedly so was I. My 3-year old immediately began repeating all the words and throughly enjoyed it. I think this will become a new favorite in our house, and I love it because I can use the video in so many ways to improve both the boys' language skills. If you are looking for a great teaching tool, as well as a very enjoyable DVD, then you won't be disappointed with this DVD.",1168560000,2,819,4.503355704697986
8114088,5,B000ETOID2,"I did not allow my 1 1/2 year old to watch TV programs, ""baby"" DVDs, etc. based on reports I've heard/read.  Yet when I received this DVD as a gift and reviewed it, I fell in love.  The product provides a variety of interesting, moving images, accompanied by diverse sounds and music, as well as one or two words per frame.  Each frame comes on slowly, states a word(s), gives you and/or baby a chance to repeat and then concludes.  There are sunrises, kittens, bubbles, birds, babies, ducks, trains, cars, dogs, and many more images to watch and talk about with your baby.  The DVD also includes suggestions on how to view it with your baby.  I have reviewed other baby DVDs, which, in comparison are loud, very busy, and overstimulating.  I highly recommend the Baby Society as a great alternative.",1164412800,3,800,4.631205673758865
