4525770,4,B0051QS1OK,"Forensic Files is an American documentary-style series which reveals how forensic science is used to solve violent crimes, mysterious accidents, and even outbreaks of illness. The show takes a ""whodunit"" approach, making each case a mystery to be solved. Every 22 minutes episode follows one case from initial investigation until conviction, acquittal, or some other legal resolution. Pathologists, medical examiners, police officers, detectives, prosecutors, defense attorneys, friends and families of victims or sometimes even the suspects themselves are all interviewed about their roles.

This set is about Sex Crimes. All 12 investigations are very interesting. Here are the 12 episodes you'll find on this set:

1. Bad Blood: The case of John Schneeberger is related. The Saskatchewan doctor was accused of sexually assaulting female patients. Although initial DNA tests cleared him, he later admitted to circumventing the testing by inserting a plastic tube filled with another man's blood into his arm.
2. Badge of Deceit: For more than a decade, women in a small Louisiana city lived in fear of a serial rapist. Fortunately, computer technology and behavioral science combined to give police a new forensic tool: geographical profiling. Police narrow their search to one man, but to prove he's the perpetrator they turn to an unlikely piece of evidence - a discarded cigarette butt.
3. Double Cross: A Virginia apartment is the location of a terrible scene; a robbery interrupted, two people - the intruder and the homeowner's wife - killed in the process. But police soon discover this is no random burglary, as evidence surfaces that suggests the homeowner's wife knew the intruder, who had plenty of motive for murder.
4. Palm Print Conviction: How investigators managed to lift a handprint from the body of a murder victim using superglue fumes, and so gained enough evidence to catch her killer
5. Pet Rock: A woman is bound with electrical cords from a reptile tank heated rock, and murdered. Investigators are able to match forensic evidence to the owner of a boa constrictor living nearby.
6. Photo Finish: The murder of model Linda Sobek is detailed. Police identified a suspect from photos discovered by a traffic scofflaw picking up trash. The suspect, Charles E. Rathbun, claimed Sobek died during consensual sex and that he panicked, but the forensic evidence proved otherwise.
7. Quite a Spectacle: Police in Canada received a chilling 9-1-1 call from a woman who was just attacked in her apartment, but by the time they arrived, she was dead. Little evidence remained at the scene, except for a pair of eyeglasses and a shoeprint in a squished tomato.
8. Smiley Face: A woman was sexually assaulted, stabbed, and left for dead. She survived and provided a description of her attacker. When someone who fit the description came forward, police were sure they had their man... until the DNA evidence proved them wrong.
9. Soft Touch: Fingerprints extracted from fabric are used to identify a young woman's killer.
10. Telltale Tracks: In Philadelphia a woman`s car was found abandoned on the side of a busy highway... still running. But the driver was missing. At the scene, police found several clues. But was there enough forensic evidence to solve the mystery?
11. Unmasked: A serial rapist is on the loose in a Texas town.  No one knows where he'll strike next, but the audacity of his attacks and the escalation of violence against his victims make finding him imperative.
12. Window Watcher: A woman's story seemed far fetched - A man wearing only underwear and gloves broke into the house, stabbed her boyfriend to death, and raped and terrorized her for hours afterward. But the evidence at the scene supported her story, and investigators turned for help to the FBI and their criminal profilers.",1352160000,5,3826,5.108626198083067
4525771,5,B0051QS1OK,"FORENSIC FILES [SEX CRIMES] is the second DVD i have watched in this wonderful series. Showing how they have been able to solve almost impossible cases through Forensic Science. One interesting episode showed a womans body wraped in a blanket, and tied with a cord that had two blocks on it.  Detectives didn't know what it was, as they had never seen an object quite like that befor, also on the blanket were black hairs. Through the examination process they discoverd the black hairs were dog hairs, and the cord with the two blocks on it were heating pads, used for reptiles in glass cages to keep warm on.  They then knew the killer had a black dog, and a pet reptile, which could be a snake, or a kind of lizard.  Guess what......they got their killer.  Thanks to this great advance in FORENSICS, its  putting these killers away where they belong, I intend to watch all the FORENSIC FILES DVDS they are a very interesting series. It puts you with all the Detectives, and the Forensic people too. Almost like you are helping to solve these crimes with them.",1342396800,5,1061,4.563157894736842
