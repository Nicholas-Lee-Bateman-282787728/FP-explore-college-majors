I would have liked a longer routine, tho.  More choreography, with a little less instruction, would have made me feel like I got my money's worth.",1515110400,,313,4.288135593220339
8237900,5,B0010JMFXA,"This quickly became one of my favorites, I've had it maybe 2 months and have done it many times already.  Great choreography, rather complex but Petra is a great instructor.  Once I got the hang of it I was really proud that I got down these really fun combinations.  Love this video, highly recommend for intermediate/advanced steppers.",1426204800,,337,4.87719298245614
8237901,5,B0010JMFXA,"Her steps are interesting, but she goes over them enough for me to catch on. It's a good workout, and the step sequences keep my mind engaged as well as working out my body. It's step like I have known and loved for years now. I'm thrilled to be able to do it in my own home.",1389484800,,275,3.8421052631578947
