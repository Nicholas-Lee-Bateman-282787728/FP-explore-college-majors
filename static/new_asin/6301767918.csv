357484,5,6301767918,"This is one of the best British military films I've seen.  First off the film was shot on location in Natal (South Africa).  The Producer Cy Enfield is himself a Zulu War historian, so this film is true to actual events.  The film has a lot of action in it ( the battle takes up nearly half the  film).  And the portrayal of the officers and men is remarkable.  This film  shows the true courage, dedication, and loyalty that most British solders  had during this war, even if he didn't know exactly what he was fighting  for.  The battle seens are as accurate as I've ever seen.  I am extremely  proud to have this film in my  private collection.",915753600,,647,4.336134453781512
357485,5,6301767918,"In January, 1879, a column of British soldiers comprised primarily of the 24th Regiment of Foot, South Wales Borderers, was wiped out at the base of the mountain, Isandhlwana, in Natal, South Africa.  A large contingent of  4,000 Zulu warriors then moved on to the undermanned expedition base at  Rorke's Drift.  This movie tells the incredible true story of the  subsequent battle, and of the victory of the 90 some British soldiers, many  of them sick, who held their post in the face of overwhelming odds.  See  Donald Morris' definitive book, _The Washing of the Spears_, against which  this film account compares most favorably.
This neglected classic was  filmed at a time when it was still just possible to associate the word  ""glory"" with military victory-- without a sneer.  The makers of  the film avoid preaching and just let the battle tell the tale of the men  of both sides.  The British soldiers are not the ""good guys"" nor  are the Zulus ""bad guys,"" and the lone derogatory comment about  the fighting ability of the Zulus is instantly rebuffed by a tough Boer  cavalryman who says, ""And just who do you think is coming to wipe out  your little garrison, the Grenadier Guards?""  This is a soldier's  story about a soldier's fight.
Did the Welsh really sing ""Men of  Harlach"" as they manned their mealie-bag barricades?
Did the Zulus  really render a warrior's salute as they broke off the action on the second  day of the battle?
It doesn't matter.  The film is accurate in the  historical basics that really count.
Beautifully filmed on location, with  an outstanding, stirring score by John Barry, this film features solid but  appropriately understated performances by Stanley Baker, Michael Caine, and  Jack Hawkins.
I hesitate to mention the hideous, politically correct  pre-quel, _Zulu Dawn_ which was released almost 25 years after _Zulu_, but  any viewer who has the unhappy experience of seeing _Zulu Dawn_ should not  be put off from seeing _Zulu_, which shines in comparison.
Whether one is  interested in military history or a ""movie for men who like  movies,"" _Zulu_ is a worthy addition to a film library.  From first to  last, it is a compelling, superior film.",915667200,185,2193,4.896174863387978

357832,2,6301767918,"Review of Zulu
Hot Toasty Rag, November 23, 2017

While Zulu is one of the most famous war movies to come out of the 1960s, and there are many reasons to watch it, if you don't usually like that genre, you probably won't like it. Similar to the plot of 55 Days at Peking, one of my all-time favorite war films, this movie follows a small group of British soldiers, grossly outnumbered by the enemy, who try to hold out as long as possible.

Among the soldiers are Lieutenants Stanley Baker and Michael Caine, as well as Nigel Green, James Booth, Neil McCarthy, Ivor Emmanuel, Paul Daneman, and Glynn Edwards. While sometimes Stanley and Michael differ in their views of how to command the troops, Jack Hawkins rants and raves of the virtues of peace because hes a missionary. Jacks daughter Ulla Jacobsson tries to help among the wounded men, but since shes the only woman in the movie, sometimes she doesnt get treated very fairly.

It wasn't Michael Caines first movieI saw him in a movie from 1957it was his first major role, so the studio gave him a large introducing credit. If you're a Michael Caine fan, and you can tolerate a long, tedious war film, you might want to see him two years before his overnight stardom from Alfie. Even if you're not particularly a fan, but you want to see him in an extremely handsome role, he looks particularly dreamy in Zulu.

All in all, I was pretty boredwhen I wasn't drooling over Michael Caine, that is.  The film wasn't nearly as interesting as other war flicks Ive seen, and even Richard Burtons official sounding narration wasn't able to save it.",1511395200,,1595,4.582456140350877
357833,5,6301767918,"This must stand as one the very finest war movies ever made. It is also one of the few movies about the European colonial presence in Africa that treats the native Africans with respect and shows their warriors as possessed of unbelievable courage and discipline. The movie is a fictionalized version of actual events that took place in the 1870's. The plot focusses on the defense of a small outpost by 120 British, mainly Welsh, soldiers as the Zulu rear guard repeatedly attacks them following the utter defeat of a British army numbering 1500 the day before. Although told from the British point of view, the movie gives the Zulu warriors recognition as equally capable soldiers who are even more valorous than the British troops as they stand up to the superior weaponry and firepower of the British. The movie is nicely framed by scenes of victorious soldiers stacking the weapons of defeated enemy troops. Baker and Caine are portrayed sympathetically as reluctant battlefield heroes who rise to the occasion in spite of their relative inexperience as leaders in deadly combat. And in keeping with the movie's respect for the Zulus, the very last scene presents the Zulu soldiers as human beings of compassion and dignity. The production values of the film are excellent, and the combat scenes are effective in conveying both fear and courage in the face of almost certain death. There are many memorable scenes, but one that stands out comes near the end. As the Zulu prepare for their final attack, they engage in ritual chanting which is both defiant and inspirational. The Welsh soldiers answer with a rousing version of ""Men of Harlech,"" equally defiant and inspirational as the two groups of soldiers engage in vocal combat prior to the impending one. The only thing that is obviously unrealistic is the depiction of wounds suffered by both sides as clean and producing death quickly, without the gore of actual battlefields. But the combat sequences work well without the depiction of actual disembowelment. For me, this movie rivals Ted Turner's Gettysburg as the best depiction of a specific historical battle. Recommended highly and with enthusiasm.",1511308800,,2166,5.036211699164346

Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded as a result of this defense, one of the highest number for single actions in the history of the British military. Since the battle was about 10 hours, I'd think it would certainly be the most per hour!

Michael Caine (in his ""introductory"" role) and Stanley Baker are outstanding, as is pretty much the entire cast. The location filming is stunning, and scenes of indigenous life seem to come straight out of National Geographic.

You'll never forget the last charge of the Zulu, or their final tribute.

357936,5,6301767918,"I have always loved this film since the first time I had seen it.
Here we have a story, where against all odds, simply by sticking to order and discipline in the face of what appears to be a no win situation, a very small group of solders, stands up and survives against an numerically superior force, and comes through it alive.
Say what you will about the British, but these men went down in history as true heroes who valiantly repelled assaults from wave after wave of Zulu attacks.
The movie really captures the gravity of the situation, and drives home the value of military discipline, and perhaps just darn good luck in the outcome. Another must have for any serious movie collector.",1507766400,,691,4.580645161290323

358314,5,6301767918,"The Blu-Ray version of the movie brings in all sorts of details that I could not see before. Unfortunately, not all of them benefit the movie if you happen to be knowledgeable about firearms. The biggest one has to do with the rifles used by the actors.

I can forgive the armorers using Webley Mark VI revolvers instead of the Webley-Pryse revolvers Chard and Bromhead would have carried. Visually, they are very similar, with the main difference being in the longer hammer spur. But the rifles are another matter.

The production company was unable to obtain enough Martini-Henry rifles to equip all of the extras, and had to fill in with No. 1 Mark IV Enfields disguised with socket bayonets as used on the Martini-Henrys. In the scene at 1:37:30 where Chard orders a walking advance and volley fire by ranks, the cocking pieces can be seen moving forward as the men shoot, and one kneeling man can even be seen working the bolt on his rifle. As a rule, throughout the movie in any scene shot from the soldiers' left, the rifles being used are bolt action Enfields.  In any scene shot from the right, they are using tilting block Martini-Henrys. You can see the Enfields again in the climactic battle where the company is half in front of the mealie bag redoubt and half behind it. The troops out front have Martini-Henrys; the troops behind the mealie bags have Enfields.

The rifle anomalies only will bother gun guys. But aside from that, and ignoring character changes made for a more dramatic presentation (for instance, Private Henry Hook, VC was a teetotaler and an exemplary soldier, not a drunken troublemaker), it is a compelling movie about soldiers who stood up against 20 times their number -- and prevailed.",1491436800,2,1724,4.7558528428093645

358650,5,6301767918,"Zulu is one of the few war movies that I treasure. It was made while South Africa was suffering under the yoke of oppression known as apartheid. It tells a story of a battle fought in 1879 between a small troop of British soldiers numbering in the hundreds and a force of about 4000 Zulu warriors in Natal Province. There are remarkable battle scenes which live in the memory as examples of perfect use of superior technology, military discipline and tactical know-how on the part of the British and the amazing power of the vast Zulu army headed by its superb generals which had already defeated a much larger British force. It's a Hollywood version of events. One should realize that as the drama unfolds. That said, it is a classic that is totally engrossing to watch today as it was when it was released in the 1970's. It also doesn't really ignore the complexities of the political situation that existed between the Boers and the British that resulted in the Boer War.",1479686400,3,974,4.635838150289017

358854,1,6301767918,"A great story about an epic battle befouled by the inherent nature and beliefs of the screenwriters, interjecting their own bitter bile into an historic event.  But don't take my word for it, watch the movie.  Think you're getting a true portrayal of that drunken sot Reverent Witt?  He wasn't even there!  He left just before the battle to be with his wife and daughter.  What about private 'Hookie'? Private Hook, who was depicted as an insubordinate malingerer under arrest in the hospital, was actually a teetotaler, Methodist PREACHER, and model soldier.
The screen writers were John Prebble and Cy Endfield, both associated with the communist party, and true haters of anything religious, which they managed to convey beyond question in the movie.
If you look at the movie from the combatants point of view like Private Hook and many others who fought and died there, the screenwriters praise their bravery out one side of their mouths and defile their beliefs out the other by interject their own bigotry, bias, and prejudice.
Incidentally, this is why Congress held the HUAC hearings. This kind of propaganda is why Cy Endfield was blacklisted several years before.
The movie is very entertaining, but then, it was meant to be.  Nevertheless I really really despise this kind of propagandistic crap and mental fornication, and I'm not even religious.
addendum:  His family was devastated by his (Hook's) portrayal as a lazy soldier and his elderly daughter, Letitia Bunting, walked out of the film's premiere in disgust at her father's treatment.",1473897600,4,1554,5.070588235294117

358940,5,6301767918,"'Zulu' has been one of my favorite war films since I was a teenager. I was inspired to buy it on Blu-ray after watching a biography on Michael Caine on Amazon Prime video the other day.

While not 100% historically accurate, Zulu truly is a miraculous achievement when one considers its limited budget and the fact that it was mostly filmed in South Africa at the height of apartheid in the early 1960s. Producers Stanley Baker (Lt. Chard) and Cy Endfield (who also directed) are to be commended for pulling off what looks like a big-budget widescreen extravaganza on the screen. The Battle of Rorke's Drift was actually an example of unabashed British colonialism, but the creators of the film succeed both in portraying the Zulus as courageous opponents and showing the downside of expansion of the British Empire at the end of the 19th century.

The extras included on the Blu-ray are very enlightening. In the film commentary track, one of the primary assistant directors and a historian specializing in the era detail how 200 Zulu extras were used to make viewers believe there really were 4,000 of them opposing the 100 or so British  soldiers defending the mission/hospital at Rorke's Drift. In addition, star/producer Stanley Baker's wife Ellen provides a personal touch that only one very close to a man who was instrumental in creating the film can provide. Several members involved in the extras give interesting takes on how Michael Caine managed to get the role of Lt. Bromhead on the film, and give opinions as to how good his upper-class accent was when he actually came from a lower-class cockney background (of course, today we know that Caine went on to become one of the most versatile actors in the world, able to do almost any accent).

'Zulu' is an extraordinary movie. It has excellent pacing, superb cinematography (the incredible South African vistas are characters in themselves, much like John Ford's classic westerns), a tight script, and marvelous acting--especially from a very green Michael Caine and Stanley Baker. It is indeed a shame that Baker died of lung cancer a little more than a decade after this movie was released... 'Zulu' is indeed a tribute to him, as Lt. Chard is the role for which he is probably most remembered.

It has often been said that great movies don't age, and this one certainly fits in that category.",1470009600,4,2360,4.8606965174129355

Clearly the African native force was extremely brave, and had strength in numbers, but was using spears against rifles.  At the same time, the movie depicts tremendous bravery and discipline on the part of the British.

I have very mixed feelings about imperialism and colonialism.  But I thoroughly enjoyed the movie as a work of dramatic art.  I plan on watching it again.  Thank You...",1470009600,,490,4.914634146341464

359105,5,6301767918,"50 year old films about imperial battles can often be very dated.  However, I'm glad to say that Zulu continues to be as relevant and excellent a film as I remember it.  It concerns the battle of Rorkes Drift in 1879, when a group of 100 British soldiers held off a powerful Zulu force of 4000 warriors, which had just destroyed a column of over 1000 British soldiers.  Rather than a jingoist film celebrating the empire, it shows the fears and horrors of warfare and portrays the Zulu culture and bravery in a very sympathetic light.  Considering this was filmed in apartheid South Africa,under the wary eye of the government that was a considerable achievement.

Featuring excellent performances by Stanley Baker (who also produced), Jack Hawkins,Michael Caine (in his first major film role) and a first class cast, this is a great action movie.  The music by John Barry alone is worth the price of the disc - a score he developed using Zulu songs and rhythms.  However, it is much more than an action movie as it examines war, bravery and the clash of cultures (Zulu, British and Boer).

This Blu-ray edition is a multi-region version but played perfectly well in my machine and the quality of the picture was excellent, really highlighting the magnificent scenery.  The special features include a number of interviews with the surviving cast, crew and family about making the film that give a lot of interesting detail on the difficulties involved, including working under (and around) apartheid constraints

with several hundred native soldiers back-packers and guides, the 'Zulu' forces turned
their attention to the mission at 'Rorke's Drift'
There were around 100 regulars at 'Rorke's Drift' mainly Welsh recruits of the 24th regiment,
who were about to face around 4000 'Zulu' warriors.
The 100 prevailed against overwhelming odds.
'Lt John Chard'(Stanley Baker) a military engineer took command of the small force with
'Lt Gonville Bromhead' (Michael Caine) (in his first film-role) second in command.
Neither had any experience of military action prior to the events at 'Rorke's Drift'

359172,4,6301767918,"They don't make em like this anymore! Though more than fifty years old this film still offers an incredible viewing experience. Its based on the epic defence of a small post by 150 British soldiers against a Zulu force of 4,000. While they had guns against the Zulus spears, this hadnt helped a much larger British force which was wiped out the day before. It is a clash of Empires and while the Zulus themselves were hardly the Red Cross both sides here are shown as incredibly brave. Indeed the Zulus are depicted in quite a positive light. They are superbly costumed and their charges are a thing to behold!
While the events are fixed firmly in the days of the British Empire, there is a notable nod to the changing sensitivities regarding such things in the 1960s. There is a clear anti-war tone, to the point that several characters are considerably misrepresented. There are other fictions too but the depiction of young men in bloody combat is surprisingly affecting. The violence is less visceral than that common today but there is a LOT of bayonet and spear stabbing. It is all done with the stunning scenery of Natal as back-ground. There are many highlights, from Nigel Greens performance, to the brilliant theatre of the sing-off. Highly recommended!",1461888000,2,1263,4.798165137614679

This blu ray is so keen that you can actually discern the various shades of red in the soldiers' tunics, as well as heretofore unnoticed facial characteristics such as Michael Caine's freckles and fair, fair skin. This is one dvd that never disappoints.  The sound is equally excellent. This is the story of the British ""Alamo"" that took place in 1879.  The British under General Chelmsford were waging a war against the Zulu chief, Cetshwayo in South Africa.  Chelmsford underestimated the prowess of both the chief and his thousands of strong warriors.  Chelmsford's main contingent, numbering several thousand British troops and service personnel, were ambushed on the plains of Islandwanda where the Zulus made short work of the redcoats, leaving no one alive.  Zulus then went on a forced march to a place called Rorke's Drift where they knew a missionary church and a small British infantry unit were posted. At Rorke's Drift, a unit of Royal Engineers had been sent ahead from the main body to build a bridge so that the troops could cross a river.  A Boer scout told the two commanding officers, one an engineer named Chard, (Stanley Baker) and the other, an infantry officer named Bromhead (Caine) about the slaughter and the two men started defense preparations. The Brits were aided by advice from the Boer officer who described how the Zulus attacked. Based on that knowledge Chard used his engineering skills to fortify the location while Bromhead's knowledge of field tactics enabled all the troops to fight off the numerous waves of attacks. In the aftermath, this group of British soldiers received the most decorations of any group before or since. The movie is exciting and there are so many great character portrayals that Caine and Baker seem to just blend in.",1458518400,20,1917,4.990595611285267

This is not fiction, but the telling of a real battle in South Africa.  The political correctness of the British presence in South Africa is not an issue nor addressed in this movie.  Nor are motives for being there.  A straight forward telling of how a particular battle evolved and how the men behaved during he fight.  The interaction between the engineer and the infantry officers is very interesting.  Conflict between them with respect and no degrading or name calling.  And of course the ability of the British to wear their uniforms well - even in a battle.  (The British armed forces do a ceremonial parade extremely dwell - not a point in the movie but an observation.)  You have to love the propernes of the Color Sergeant during the final roll call.

It is a shame what they did to the memory of Harry Hook, who in reality was the exact opposite of the character portrayal in the movie.  A diligent soldier, a non-drinker, the reason he ended up as part of the hospital defense was that he was the assigned hospital cook.  After the battle, when he was called to report to the general on what he had witnessed, he had already cleared out the bodies in his cookhouse and was making tea for the company.  He richly deserved his Victoria Cross.",1443744000,3,542,4.4
359740,5,6301767918,"British Officers Chard and Bromhead prepare their company of 140 men against an impending attack of 4,000 Zulu warriors.  The men are camped inside a former trading outpost, just within the borders of Natal, South Africa.  Two soldiers arrive at the station to warn the garrison that the Zulus are on their way to attack.

There were many sick and injured men among the garrison.  This made escape impossible as the column would move too slow to outrun the Zulus.  The only choice was to stay and defend the outpost.  The movie was actually based on the events that took place in Rorke's Drift, in 1879.

Stanley Baker is the senior officer in the camp.  Michael Caine is Lt. Bromhead, in one of his earlier big screen roles.  The production is of very high value, as well as the acting.

360005,5,6301767918,"I've enjoyed reading the historical background in these reviews of Zulu, and agree that it is a great picture.  However, my take on it seems to differ from most.  It seems to me the earliest anti-war, anti-colonial film I can think of, and though the extraordinary true-life courage of the British soldiers is without question, what stands out just as much to me is that the British were invading colonists and the Zulus were defending their homeland.  As such, I'm relieved that the Zulus are portrayed with sensitivity and respect.  It is impossible to watch this film without being touched by the beauty of the Zulu chants, the aesthetics of exotic costumery, the courage of facing firearms with only spears and shields.  Three scenes that make the film:  the tension of the distant thunder of the approaching Zulu army, the juxtaposition of morale-building songs on both sides before the last battle, and the Zulu salute to the British soldiers as they voluntarily retreated.  I think it should be remembered that, if accurately portrayed, the British didn't win.  The Zulus had the humanity to forfeit rather than continue a slaughter.",1435190400,,1140,4.994708994708994

It is more accurately a very focused look at the one early success of the British in that war, a battle called Rourke's Drift,  and a tribute to the extreme courage displayed. I was very surprised and disappointed to learn that this was not available through the Amazon Fire TV service, offering instead a very bad movie from the same period and some more modern monstrosity which is apparently a biography of Chaka Zulu, one of Africa's most active mass murderers. The cover sets the tone with Chaka looking like some Voo-Doo demon. Appropriate I suppose but still not especially attractive.

Of course it goes without saying that it WAS the Zulus land and the British probably had no business there anyway, just as the Europeans had no business kicking Native Americans off their land.

360243,5,6301767918,"Director Cy Endfield and actor Stanley Baker conjured up a box office winner with this stirring account of a small British garrison's defence of the Rorke's Drift mission station against an overwhelming force of Zulu warriors in colonial South Africa. Since its theatrical debut in 1964 ""Zulu"" has received widespread popular acclaim and is rated among the top one third of the British Film Institute's 100 greatest films.

Misconceptions would be easy in our era of political correctness. So, be assured, a jingoistic, flag-waving paean to colonialism this film is not. There's a strong anti-war message here. From the young private who asks, ""why us,"" to the garrison commander asserting that he came to ""build a bridge,"" the British soldiers are shown to be homesick outsiders in a strange country they find at once fascinating and perilous. For their part, the Zulus are magnificent. Their chilling war chants and shield-beating (""....it's that damn train again"") are so effective that both Peter Jackson and Ridley Scott later borrowed the idea for their own work (""The Two Towers"" and ""Gladiator"").

Above all this is a film about valour. The heroes are warriors who share a common bond forged in battle. At its climax the surviving defenders grapple desperately with the proud and mighty Zulu army as each side comes to respect the bravery and prowess of the other. Driven by John Barry's inspiring score, we are presented with a splendid and unforgettable cinematic experience.",1426291200,,1485,5.132231404958677

360246,4,6301767918,"I saw this movie when it was released in 1964 and several times since then, but recently had the urge to see it again so I went ahead and bought the DVD from Amazon.  ""Zulu"" is a Cy Endfield / Stanley Baker account of the battle of Rorke's Drift, in which 140 British foot soldiers withstood a series of attacks by a Zulu force numbering around 4000.  While the acting, costumes and cinematography are first class, there are a few historical inaccuracies in the film that should be pointed out:

1.  The annoying Swedish missionary and his daughter fled the scene long before the battle began, as opposed to the movie's version of them being locked up on the post during the first series of Zulu attacks.
2.  In determining which of the two lieutenants would assume overall command for the battle, the date of Chard's commission was actually 3 YEARS before Bromhead's, not 3 months as stated in the movie.
3.  The portrayal of Pvt Henry Hook is very inaccurate.  Hook was a fine, obedient soldier -- not the drunken malcontent shown in the film.  He in fact received the Victoria Cross - the highest battle award for a British soldier - for his heroism during the battle.
4.  The portrayal of Lt Gonville Bromhead is not entirely accurate.  Bromhead was not the flamboyant, aristocratic dandy as shown in the first part of the film.  While he did come from several generations of high-ranking officers in the British Army, he himself was not highly regarded, as evidenced by his low rank (Lieutenant) for his length of commission (7 years) at the time of this battle.  Also, Gonville Bromhead was nearly deaf -- a fact not brought to light at all in this movie.
5.  The film barely mentions one of the real heroes of Rorke's Drift:  James Dalton, Assistant Commissary.  Dalton, who had - unlike Chard and Bromhead - actual combat experience, was instrumental in setting up the defense of Rorke's Drift.  Chard and Bromhead took advice from him in laying out the mealie bag walls and overturning the wagons to complete the barricades.  During the battle, Dalton performed heroically and was severely wounded.  He was one of the 11 recipients of the Victoria Cross.
6.  In the movie, the actor playing Color Sergeant Bourne was middle-aged and quite tall (over 6').  In reality, Bourne was only 5'5"" tall and just 24 years old at the time of the battle.
7.  The actual battle was fought from about 4:30 p.m. until  2:00 a.m. -- a majority of it after sundown.  In the movie, almost all of the battle scenes are during daylight hours.
8.  The final Zulu attack after sunrise the following day never occurred.  The hostilities had ended at around 2:00 a.m.  The Zulus did appear on the horizon after sunrise, but they soon left after seeing a large British force off in the distance headed toward Rorke's Drift.
9.  The movie was filmed 60 miles away from Rorke's Drift in an area much more mountainous than the area around Rorke's Drift.  The hill behind the post in the movie is much taller and steeper than the actual one at Rorke's Drift.
10.  The British lost only 17 men during the battle.  The movie leads one to believe that they lost at least half of their force.
11.  350 Zulus were killed outright by British bullets and bayonets during the battle.  After the battle, approximately 500 Zulu warriors lay wounded on the battlefield.  All of the Zulu wounded were executed by the British (shot, bayoneted, or hung), perhaps in retaliation for similar treatment of British wounded at the nearby battle of Isandlwana (over 1300 British soldiers were slaughtered at Isandlwana).  The movie makes no mention of how the wounded Zulus at Rorke's Drift were dealt with.

Despite these inaccuracies, the movie is well-made and a worthwhile watch.  Some would criticize its lack of realism in many of the battle scenes (not enough blood and gore, bayonet ""kills"" that obviously miss the mark, ""spears"" that can be seen wobbling and obviously made of rubber), but the movie was made back in 1964 -- well before the advent of CGI and other cinematic tricks.  If you are expecting to see eviscerations and decapitations, you will be disappointed.  If, on the other hand, you want to view a fairly accurate, well-made reenactment of the Battle of Rorke's Drift that focuses on the bravery and tenacity of both the British and the Zulus, this movie is highly recommended.",1425945600,7,4362,4.720899470899471

Out numbered and smack in the middle of enemy territory surrounded by thousands of ZULU warriors against a couple of hundred brave British soldiers, a miracle-of-miracles takes place.

A multitude against a handful of soldiers, a mere garrison, against 4,000 ZULU natives on ZULU soil. A spectacular cinematic achievement that's superb.  And an action packed battle thriller that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat with anticipation of what else, the courageous British Garrison will do next, to fend off the fierce ZULU warriors. Phenomenal battle scenes that will leave the viewing audience in amazing, awe. History buffs, this is not a documentary.

These men hold off the 4,000 Zulus for 3 days, when the Zulus decide to move on ans salute the courage and fighting spirit of the white men.

This depicts a struggle between races but it is by no means a ""racist"" film.  The Zulus are depicted as magnificent warriors, worthy opponents for the British Empire.

Like all great war films, it is an anti-war film as well.

Essentially a Stanley Baker production, it reproduces in a South African setting, the kind of struggle long a staple of the American film industry, the outnumbered Troops against the Indians. The difference, however, between this and the American-scene epic, until recent decades, is that it shows the virtues, courage and skill of each, and the role of advanced weaponry in defeating less well equipped enemies, no matter their numbers and leadership. Both Baker and Caine perform ably as commanding officers in a beleaguered outpost, and there are a host of well done vignettes by the actors portraying subordinates. The battle scenes involve both sweeping masses and hand-to-hand struggle, both quite well handled. The human weaknesses and strengths of the troops are brought out as are the less individualized shrewdness and courage of the enemy.

360801,5,6301767918,"A gripping portrayal of the events at Rorkes Drift, January 1879.

A small force of 1350 British soldiers was overwhelmed by 22,000 zulus at Islandwana.

The next day, an even smaller force of British troops repeatedly repelled an onslaught of 4000 zulus assaulting a missionary station converted into a field hospital. Here is their story gloriously portrayed on film! One of the greatest war-movies ever!

Against all odds, Lieutenant John Chard and Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead organized 139 British soldiers in a desperate improvised defense in the face of wave after wave of zulu tribesmen. Armed with nothing more than the standard single-shot breach-loaded Martini-Henry rifles and bayonets, this small garrison held out despite being hopelessly out-numbered and completely surrounded.

Nearly over-run on numerous occassions, under heavy fire from enemies shooting at them from the hills above, fighting at close-quarters and hand-to-hand in every engagement, ...this stubborn band of Redcoats made every shot count, and doled out plenty of punishment with cold-steel, rifle-butt, boots and bare-fists.

With such limited arms and numbers, defending such a dubious make-shift position against vast quantities of enemy fighters, it would seem inevitable that these brave British soldiers would eventually be overwhelmed like Chelford's troops at Islandwana...

This is a primary lesson in the matter of quality over quantity.
Advantages are one thing, ...but war is ultimately won in the will of the combatants...
Throughout the 19th. century British fighting-men found frequently found themsleves enormously out-numbered on the battlefield, ...but NOT out-classed!

In the aftermath of this battle, ...eleven Victoria Crosses and several other awards were earned at Rorkes Drift.

This spectacular resistance was the result of two worthy battlefield-leaders collaborating to lead a number of disciplined, well-trained professional fighting-men who were determined to make a good showing of themselves, despite what seemed to be an inevitable violent death. What is unfortunate to mention, is that the two junior officers who so ably guided the defense of Rorke's Drift were very badly treated by their commanding officers after the event. Obviously, these were the typical garrison-types whose careers and advanced rank were entirely due to family connections and social status. Their names are not worthy to be mentioned here, and deserve to be forgotten.

No one who studies military history will ever forget the names of Chard and Bromhead!",1405641600,,2551,5.639686684073107

360805,5,6301767918,"I am not going to write much here because there are already some brilliant reviews listed that actually describe the story, pacing, acting, and artists involved with this masterpiece. There is only one point that I really want to add to what has already been stated concerning ""ZULU.""

The TENSION of impending attack upon a fortified position is better portrayed here than in any other release that I know of.  This suspense lasts throughout almost all of the movie, and it is electric!  Stanley Baker is as good in this show as Lawrence Olivia is in Richard III, or maybe Bogart in ""Casablanca"" ...maybe better.  Michael Caine is perfect in his role, and does a great job as do all of the other primary performers.

In ""Saving Private Ryan"", there is a moment near the end when Tom Hanks and his squad is about to defend a small French town against a possible assault of German resistance.  Hanks and his men are waiting, and then the sound of approaching panzers is faintly discerned in the distance.  The ominous roar of the overwhelming Axis force slowly becoming visible as they march across a large, sparse area of land in the distance begins to send shivers down the spines of the American troops, (and viewers of the show), who then realize how they are about to be swamped by such a massive force, ...  It is this ""moment of realized horror"" that exists in the Hanks film that is literary amplified within the wonderful ""ZULU"" performance.

I first saw ZULU at a drive-in theater in 1964 when the previews were all over the media as it was a big, new movie then.  I still remember the shivers I got when the Zulu army appeared on top of the mountain range, or when they ""trilled"" war cries.  Those sensations still come to me now, ...still when I watch this presentation, as I have many times in the years since.

Spielberg, Hitchcock, or no other director in my experience has ever topped the majesty of ""ZULU"" for me.  I seem to never lose the excitement I feel whenever I sit down to experience it over, and over again.",1403827200,,2032,4.549450549450549

360880,5,6301767918,"I'm not going to regurgitate the story or background to this movie as many reviewers have already covered it extensively but I wanted to highlight a few areas which give me a lot of  pleasure when I watch this film.

Firstly, there is the acknowledgement that the Zulus are magnificent warriors - facing the most modern army in the world in terms of firepower yet still managing to win a great victory at Isandhlwana through superior numbers and strategy against the poorly led and organized British - and looking as though they might do the same at Rourke's Drift. Despite the age of the movie the Zulu is respected throughout and I feel that the movie shows that, if not better led and better deployed than the soldiers at Isandhlwana, the British  would have suffered the same crushing defeat at Rourke's Drift at the hands of the indigenous people. There is really not much in terms of character development of the Zulus but really the story is focused on the small contigent of British and local levies

There are a few scenes that I particularly like - the way Stanley Baker has to tell the young bugler to spit as fear has dried up his flow of saliva, and the way Michael Caine's voice cracks as he tells his men to ""Hold them!"" And who wouldn't want the calm Colour Sergeant Bourne, played so admirably by Nigel Green, at their side when things get tough. Really there are so many characters worth watching and I think the fear and desperation of the defenders and the tenacity of the attackers is well brought out. And of course the bravery of both sides - relentlessly attacking guns when armed with spears in the same way that soldiers charged fixed machine guns on the Somme in 1916 and defending against a never ending horde. The roll call at the end gives some idea of the toll on the British whilst the piling of bodies, spears and shields does the same for the Zulu.

Let's not forget the fact that Michael Cine was playing against type in his portrayal of an upper class officer which was not his background at all and of course this was at the start of his career.

The scenery on the Blu ray is breathtaking and the soundtrack is great too complimenting the action and who can forget the chanting and shield banging as well as the rendering of Men of Harlech as a counterpoint.

360883,4,6301767918,"The only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that the battle scenes are a little on the hokey side. By that I mean that they are not very realistic. I recall one scene in which a Zulu warrior falls dead before the soldier even fires his gun. The scenes where Zulu warriors stab the British soldiers with spears are even worse. It is painfully obvious that the actors just thrust the spears off to the side and the soldier falls dead.

360927,5,6301767918,"I saw this film at least five times and every time I liked it more. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.

1. The battle of Rorke's Drift

On 22 January 1879 the central column of British Army which just invaded Zulu kingdom was divided in three parts. The main force under Lord Chelmsford (2500 men) advanced deeper in the country, searching for the main Zulu army with intention to engage it and conclude the campaign early with a decisive victory. In order to advance faster Lord Chelmsford left his train under protection of approximately 1700 men (roughly 700 regular British soldiers and 1000 colonial and native auxiliaries) at an unprotected camp at Isandlwana. Further south a smaller detachment of roughly 300 men (half regulars, half native auxiliaries) was guarding a supply depot and field hospital at Rorke's Drift.

On that fateful day the main Zulu army of 24 000 warriors skilfully avoided British main force and attacked by surprise the camp at Isandlwana. A little bit later the same day Zulu reserves counting around 4000 men attacked also the post at Rorke's Drift. At Isandlwana the battle ended in a total defeat for British, who were overwhelmed and lost 1300 killed (including almost all regulars). At Rorke's Drift however, where the Zulu had an even larger numerical superiority, things turned out very, very differently

This little British garrison was composed of a company of regular infantry, a small group of engineers and a handful of colonial and civilian auxiliaries. There was also a company of Native Natal Contingent (indigenous auxiliaries) and a cavalry company of Natal Native Horse who managed to escape from Isandlwana, but all those men fled (commanding officers and NCOs included) before the battle was joined. What remained was a force of 140 regular British soldiers (infantry and engineers) and 15 colonial and armed civilian auxiliaries  a grand total of 155 men. As Rorke's Drift was a field hospital, possibly as much as ten of those men were from the beginning too sick or too badly wounded to fight Against them advanced a force of 4000 well trained and disciplined Zulu warriors, mostly armed with traditional weapons but some of whom had also various firearms - even if those latter were mostly smooth bored flintlock muzzle loaders

The battle began at 4pm on 22 January. Zulu commanders launched a series of charges against British positions, which by moments had to be fought off by bayonets - when in the same time those warriors who had firearms (possibly as many as 200) maintained a harassing fire from neighbouring hills. The battle ended on 4am on 23 January and soon after the exhausted and disheartened Zulus retired. The butcher bill was heavy for both sides with 17 British defenders and no less than 351 Zulus lying dead. The retreating Zulus carried also away hundreds of wounded with them - when at the post almost all defenders suffered some kind of wounds, 16 of them very serious.

In both battles British troops fought hard and well, fully aware that there was no escape, that their enemies didn't usually take prisoners and also knowing, that Zulus willingly tortured wounded captives before murdering them. But the defenders of Rorke's Drift did much better when facing even worse odds and survived, when their comrades at Isandlwana, who were more numerous and even had two field guns and a battery of Congreve rocket launchers, were almost all destroyed. The main reasons why it happened are the following:

- unlike at Isandlwana, at Rorke's Drift the defenders were NOT surprised  they learned around 1pm about the disaster at Isandlwana and an advancing Zulu army and therefore they had about three hours to prepare themselves to battle; those three hours made a lot of difference

- unlike at Isandlwana, where the camp was in the middle of an open plain and there was not even a circle of wagons available, at Rorke's Drift the defenders have prepared a defensive position; it was of course NOT MUCH of a defensive position, as it was composed of a grand total of two buildings, a small enclosure for cattle (a kraal) made from low (easily climbable without help) stone walls, couple of reversed wagons and a barricade made with biscuit boxes and bags of grain found in the depot; but still it was much better than nothing

- unlike at Isandlwana, the Zulu commanders committed their troops piecemeal, with different ""regiments"" and ""companies"" attacking SUCCESSIVELY from different directions, allowing the desperately outnumbered and very hard pressed British to defeat them nevertheless one after another; this incompetence of Zulu commanders which prevented them to launch a simultaneous all azimuth attack with their whole force was possibly the decisive factor in this battle

- unlike at Isandlwana, where at the crucial moment of the extremely intense battle there were problems with opening the tightly packed munition boxes, which resulted in an interruption of fire, at Rorke's Drift there was not even one moment of problem with munitions; all men received an ample supply before battle and more munitions were carried and distributed during the battle, mostly by those sick and wounded soldiers who were not fully able to fight themselves.

- finally, unlike Lt. Col. Pulleine and Lt. Col. Durnford at Isandlwana, Lieutenants Chard and Bromhead and Assistant Commissary Dalton (civilian working for the army) who commanded jointly at Rorke's Drift managed to organise their limited resources in their improvised diminutive redoubt in possibly the optimal way, not only mounting an efficient all azimuth fixed defence but also creating a mobile reserve used successively in those sectors where a crisis developed.

Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to the defenders of Rorke's Drift, which was an exceptionally high figure for such a small engagement - although not, as commonly thought, the most awarded in a single action or the most in a day, as 16 were awarded at the Battle of Inkerman, on 5 November 1854 and 28 were awarded during the Second Relief of Lucknow, 1422 November 1857.

2. The film.

Made in 1964 ""Zulu"" is a quite faithful reconstruction of this incredible battle, although, this being a film and not a documentary, the director changed some things. Possibly the most significant change concerns the ending of the battle, as in the film the departing Zulus salute the defenders with a song  such a thing of course didn't happen but it makes one helluva beautiful scene! Also, in the film the Zulus are ordered to attack Rorke's Drift by their king Cetshwayo himself  such a thing didn't happen and in fact the attack of this small British position was the own initiative of two ""idumas"" (princes) commanding Zulu reserve force.

We are also told in the film that Zulus used at Rorke's Drift numerous modern Henry-Martini rifles captured at Isandlwana  well, it absolutely DIDN'T happen and it is a very fortunate thing for the British defenders, because then they wouldn't survive the battle. The low quality of fire arms and especially munitions used by Zulu shooters at Rorke's Drift was the main reason why their prolonged harassing fire killed only five British soldiers  with Henry-Martini rifled breech-loaders that would be a completely different story

The role in the defence of Rorke's Drift of Acting Assistant Commissary Dalton, a civilian from Commissary and Transport Department, was diminished in the film  in real life he was actually amongst those who received Victoria Cross for his part in the battle, a rather rare thing for a civilian, even under military command

Finally, the film devotes a surprisingly large part to the character of Reverend Otto Witt, Swedish missionary who warned British defenders about the approaching Zulu army and encouraged them to flee. Not only this episode is given too much time, but it also portrays this courageous and respectable missionary in an extremely unflattering way I admit that this part of the film is actually the only thing I don't like about ""Zulu"". At all.

There are some other changes, like the age or character of some participants, but I don't want to give too much spoilers.
The most important characters were of course Lieutenants Chard and Bromley, who are played here respectively by the greatly regretted Stanley Baker (he was not Sir Stanley Baker yet) and young Michael Caine, for whom it was the first major role and THE big break which launched his great career.

The film has also three main supporting characters: Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne (Nigel Green), an extremely impressive NCO, Private Henry Hook (James Booth) who begins the film being under arrest and Private Owen (Ivor Emmanuel), who is not only a darn good soldier but also a gifted baritone Bourne and Hook are real characters  the former was the last defender of Rorke's Drift to die (in 1945, aged 91) and the latter was amongst those who received a Victoria Cross. Private Owen on another hand is a fictitious character  but I am very glad the director created him)))

""Zulu"" mixes a lot of drama and extraordinary tough fights with a lot of top quality humour. Also, the music is simply AMAZING!

Bottom line, this is one of the films that EVERYBODY should watch at least once in life. One of the greatest and best war films EVER. To buy, watch, keep and pass to children. Enjoy!",1396310400,,9366,4.981422165278667

360936,5,6301767918,"In 1879 a small contingent of 140 British redcoats held a Natal mission station against a determined attack by nearly 4000 Zulu warriors. They won the day and, in the process, received 11 Victoria Crosses.

Zulu was released in 1964, directed by Cy Endfield and produced by the film's leading man, Stanley Baker. In the intervening 50 years it has come to be regarded as a classic war movie and a bit of a lad-flick, to be enjoyed with one's mates and a six pack of beer on any semi-special occasion. The depiction, by Michael Caine, of the stiff-upper-lipped Lt Bromhead is one of it's most memorable moments. It is hard to believe that the film was Caine's big-screen debut (well, sort of) and that he originally read for the part of wide-boy Pte Hook. However, if you're looking for classic performances, it's hard to choose. Baker is perhaps a little understated as Lt Chard, but try Nigel Green's patrician CSgt Bourne or James Booth's Hooky for size. Great stuff.

The story is all there in it's rousing, inspirational glory and, while there may well be a few historical inaccuracies, it's a fine, fine piece of story telling. Good too that it doesn't stray too far into the trap of waving the imperialist, jingoistic flag (well, not too energetically). There is a strongly expressed anti-war sentiment when Bromhead confesses at the end of the battle to feeling ""sick and ashamed"". Perhaps too strongly expressed as, earlier in the film, a tommy, dying in the doctor's arms, cries that eternal cliche ""Why? WHY? WHYYY?"" One needs to remember that the film IS, after all, half a century old and the emotional  reaction against several big wars in the preceding decades must have loomed large.

One might also forgive the producers their depiction of the ""baddies"" as little more than a faceless, relentless horde for much the same reason (and of course it was barely more than 10 years since another generation of tommies faced a literal yellow horde on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/a-hilside-in-Korea/dp/1845135334/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">a hilside in Korea</a>). While Zulu does its best to treat the them with respect and awe, they are, in the end, mostly little more than a brown sea to be cut down with seemingly unlimited supplies of 577/450 Boxer-Henry ammunition. Nevertheless, the film does try its best and the mass wedding ceremony at the opening of the film does try to remind us that here are 'many brides who may soon become widows'. A remake would certainly give the home team a more decently human aspect. Hopefully it would teach the extras to act a little better - there are some classic, heart-clutchingly melodramatic deaths to be seen here, along with one or two wrist-watch bearing spear-men.

All that said, like many costume dramas, this film ages very well indeed. It still looks good and, hopefully, will continue to be enjoyed by lads for many more years to come.

The Zulu are magnificent! Michael Caine, Stanley Baker, and Jack Hawkins lead a superb cast. Richard Burton narrates the opening and closing of the film -- what a voice. If they gave an Oscar for voice -- he'd have gotten it for this one. John Barry's excellent score and the Zulu chanting give life and gravitas to this epic story. Outstanding cinematography by Steven Dade. The extras are plenty and all worth watching. The commentary with second unit director Robert Porter and film historian Sheldon Hall is worth the price of admission. A true film classic of the highest order. Most highly recommended!

361152,5,6301767918,It's very simple.  If you want the best quality version of ZULU then buy the UK Blu-Ray.  It's amazing.  I had an old copy of this movie on VHS.  I wore it out.  I then bought it on DVD.  I watched it many times and each time I wished the quality was better. Finally I decided to upgrade to Blu-Ray as this film is truly worth it.  A great film.

You'll also admire the courage of the Zulus fighting for their land. Let's face it: if the British had just honored their treaty with the Zulus - see the prequel, ZULU DAWN, which gets 4-stars - none of this would have happened. But it did, so sit back and enjoy it. Superbly shot and acted, and the second half is pure adrenaline. And if you are buying the Bluray, the ONLY version to buy is the one pictured here: the red jacket, the title in white letters. It is, without question, the best transferred Bluray I have seen of an older film (and I own some of the best transfers: LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, HOW THE WEST WAS WON, BEN-HUR).

For its time it was an excellent historical re-creation of one of the bloodiest periods of 24 hours between a 'modern' rifle-armed force of soldiers vs. 4000 zulu warriors.  The bit with the missionaries could (and probably should) have been dropped but the rest of the movie is accurate and compelling.  Not surprisingly this battle got a movie made long before the events that lead up to it.  The 'complete' Zulu set in historical order should be Shaka Zulu, Zulu, then Zulu Dawn.",1371686400,,551,4.829787234042553

The Zulus were perhaps portrayed one-dimensionally, almost all the inner action was on the British side, it would have been quite interesting to learn more about how the Zulus lived, but it seemed to to me the Zulu people were otherwise honestly treated. The acting is first order. Amid the carnage and suffering, there was a fair amount of humor presented. It did seem like the film played loose with some of the facts. It's hard to believe all those Zulu warriors could survive in the middle of nowhere for several days the way portrayed in the film. It is known the Witts were rather different from what was shown in the film. But that's the nature of poetic license, I guess. The moral of the tale was reinforced by some of the fictions.",1369612800,,830,4.54

There are bloodcurdling moments in this film and the pace of the movie picks up about twenty minutes in and doesn't let up until the end of the movie.

The ""Zulu (Blu-Ray) - Remastered (Amazon Exclusive) is a completely bogus product.  I'd ordered it before reading prior reviews of it.

Of special note, I attempted to access the ""[...]"" website moments ago (May 3, 2013) and my Norton anti-virus wouldn't let me access it, labeling the website as a known ""malicious"" website.

  The letter from Lord Chelmsford that opens the film with narration over it IS NOT THE PROPER RATIO! It is streached out. Then the film starts properly.

  At 0:52:00 after the cavalry has left the sounds gets VERY quiet until after the Colour Sergeant finishes talking and the preacher starts speaking for a while. It is not long, but it is annoying since the rest of the transfer is great. Even the old Diamond DVD (not a bad copy) does not bleed out like the BluRay does.

Minor problems, admittedly, but annoying none the less because the rest of it couldn't be better. If not for these problems it would easily get 5 stars plus!

2. There is no disc Menu.
3. There is no Pause.
4. There is no Scene Selection.
5. The movie must be viwed beginning to end. The movie can not be re-started where it was stopped.

Went ahead and got this despite the fact that there was no official word of this release in the USA nor were there reviews. Received the disc 3/14/2013 and here's how it stacks up:

General observations:
1. The cover is a cheaply printed artwork that has an undeniable a bootleg quality to it
2. Its a single layer region free disc (says Region 0) released by a company called Inspired Pictures
3. the UPC Code is 007108370011 - from feedback elsewhere on the net, this seems to be the same UPC used for the UK release - and I don't know how that can be pulled off as its a different company altogether
4. the artwork on the disc too is cheap and screams knockoff
5. the playing side of the disc is a professionally pressed disc, not a BD-R

Disc:
1. opens with a FBI warning that means nothing
2. immediately followed by a 'Inspired Pictures' animation with sound following which the feature begins
3. chapter stops don't exist - pressing next or previous chapters during playback present a 'cannot operate during playback' message on my Sony BDPS570 BD player
4. There is no disc menu. Hitting the disc menu on the player's remote takes you back to the FBI warning message from where you sit through the whole sequence again
5. There are no subtitles
6. There are no extras

Video quality:
1. the PQ is remarkably free of blemishes/scratches etc - but there's more to this than just this.
2. resolution is at best upconverted DVD and little else, explains the single layer BD. This is no 1080p presentation and nowhere on the artcover or disc does it mention 1080p resolution. THIS SHOULD BE THE SOLE REASON TO AVOID THIS PRODUCT
3. Image on the screen appears to be digitally scrubbed to oblivion - the colors and contrast pop but there are no details on faces - as they appear waxy

Audio Quality:
1. No 5.1 or any other surround sound
2. Sound is limited to a limp mono English track that is sourced into the center channel.
3. The sound is clear but not remarkable

Verdict:
Avoid big time. I can't tell if its a bootleg. But why would any studio worth its salt produce a disc like this without any of the above mentioned features ? Am still deciding if I should return it (on principle of not owning inferior discs and/or bootleg) or just swallow the cost and learn a lesson.

OK... so it is a movie and besides if one wants to get picky the assegai's and isihlangu's are ""1964 pattern"".

There are no Chapters you can scan through. That's right. When you start the movie, you better be ready to watch it straight through without even a bathroom break. NO PAUSE!

The photography is spectacular! All of the exterior shots were shot on location in South Africa. If you are looking for a splatter film look elsewhere, this was shot in 1962 and they still had censors then. BUT it doesn't matter imo, the story is told with care and skill. ALL of the Zulus were actual Zulu tribe members in the stuff done on location in SA, (all of the interior shots were done in studio in London). This is a sweeping film of major scale. I loved it when I first saw it as a kid in the theater, and this Blu Ray version makes me remember  that feeling I had as a kid. Honestly, films like THIS film are the reason I own a HD system.

This was also Michael Caine's first film role.

361610,5,6301767918,"In this epic's opening titles, Michael Caine is billed with ""introducing"" despite his having been in many previous movies, including five credited roles.

ZULU is the true story of a garrison of less than 140 British (Welsh) troopers who in January of 1879 successfully stand at Rourke's Drift against an army of 4,000 South African natives. Once they begin, attacks are relentless and terrifying. Commanding officer John Chard (Baker) later gives credit for their not being overwhelmed and decimated to the Henry short chamber rifle, but the truth is, it was the stout heart and determination of these soldiers that prevailed, when previously 1,500 of their comrades had fallen.

One of the greatest war movies ever made, this is an unforgettable tribute to some of the bravest men to ever take up arms for Queen and country.

The other reviews do an excellent job of describing the plot, so I'll leave that be.

My only question has to do with how this version was cut. I actually saw a VHS version of the film which cut out a lot of the non-action scenes, which are essential to the fact that this movie is actually anti war. I guess I'll have to get the dvd to find out.

The movie starts out a bit slow, but once the battle scenes begin, I felt like I was right there in the midst of it all. It's so intersting seeing different time periods and cultures clash. I kept thinking if this was now, one 50 caliber machine gun and a massive amount of ammo would have taken care of the entire battle! Things were so much different back then! As for the quality of the picture, it was absolutely ASTOUNDING!!! I don't think I've ever seen a movie look that amazing that is that old! The crispness, clarity, colors, and sharpness were part of what made this movie so much fun to watch.

I know that this sounds a little over-the-top, and I know that the other reviews which say likewise also sound a wee bit gushing - but it is true.  Regardless of the format which you currently own, the upgrade to Blu-ray is worth every penny (or cent). Absolutely brilliant!  (I now live in the U.S. and this Amazon Blu-ray does indeed play on N.

The zulu nation was a huge empire and it's downfall was brought about by the british empire. THis movie has outstanding performances from all the aotors involved.

The real life minister at whose station the battle took place, was nothing like the psycho in the movie, with a noble, attractive daughter; who actually was two years old at the time, and no where near the battle.  Early in the film there is a long scene of massed Zulus dancing, nearly naked, males and females; accurate, but porn.  The scenes of Zulus and Red Coats battling were good.

In Jan. 1879 about 1,500 soldiers of 24th regiment of foot, the Welsh Borderers where wiped out by thousands of zulu warriors, who then went to Rorkes Drift to attack the small group of British soldiers there. Against all odds ( the odds would have less against survival if the soldiers had loaded up & left ), 90-142 British soldiers fought 4,000 Zulu warriors. The British fought off several attacks over a time period of about 30 hours or so. They held off the Zulu's in one of the greatest stands by any soldiers in history. After the battle 11 Victoria Crosses were awarded. As for the movie, it was great! It was filmed on location & the uniforms, equipment ( even the Martini-Henry rifles ) & costumes are very accurate. The movie was written from reports of the battle & this shows in the accuracy of the battle scenes. A fantastic movie & I highly recommend it!",1343088000,3,1101,4.5376884422110555

The performances of Stanley Baker and Nigel Green as Colour Sargeant Bourne are simply remarkable, especially Green. He has so many great lines, but the best, I think, is when a young soldier asks why is it that they have to face death at the hands of the Zulus, he replies, chin down, with no sense of sarcasm ""because we're here, lad.

The Blu-Ray is listed as an import which it may well be, but it is produced by Paramount Pictures rather than some off-brand like some of the DVD versions. I can only guess that they were able to locate an original print or negative to work from because the picture quality is stunning!  I have other BD films that are more recent that don't look as good as this. It is regrettable that the sound couldn't have been re-mixed into 5.1 surround instead of stereo, but the picture more than makes up for this. Every detail is razor sharp and the color is superb.

It was also a breakout role for one Michael Caine.  The movie features a great soundtrack with both orchestral themes made for the movie, traditional Zulu music, and English songs.  The costume design is great, with Zulu men and women shown in their native dress, the British army in their field uniforms, and the Boer settlers in their traditional dress styles.  What probably carries the movie is the dialogue among the British soldiers.

361969,5,6301767918,"Zulu was one of the great war movies ever made. It is an old-fashioned one without the ""darker and edgier"" flair of Blackhawk Down(which it faintly resembles in some ways) and can be accused of glorifying war. Some have called it racist because the enemy happens to be black. This shows a misunderstanding. The Zulus are treated as worthy opponents and fellow warriors who happen to be on the opposite side, and the movie does nothing to denigrate how bravely and vainly they defended their homes in this war, any more then it denigrates how bravely and successfully the Welsh defended their personal survival. As an amateur historian I note that the movie gives nothing about the larger issues around the war: that would have complicated the movie as even a Victorian-admirer like myself would, looking back, say that the British were in fact in the wrong. But of course no one asks soldiers about that, on either side.

What the movie does portray is a gallant action by a single unit that is cut off and defending itself against overwhelming numbers. It shows a rag-tag bit of soldiers, some young, at least one a criminal, people who are soldiering because they can't get a better job, coming together to make a name for themselves in history.

The best scene is the ""singing contest"", the famous Men of Harlech scene. First we are shown the Zulus singing a war-chant while the camera goes across them showing a dissonance between the martial splendor and the blank faces of the Zulu warriors, some of whom are obviously young men out for the first time and feeling out of place. Then the camera shifts back to the Welsh camp and shows young men of the same kind, now intimidated by the chant. Then, to lift up morale the commander orders them to sing Men of Harlech. The effect reminds one that for all the cultural incomprehensibility, at this one moment they are mirror images of one another. Both forces are composed of ordinary people who would rather be almost anywhere else at the moment. And both are drawing strength from tradition. For while the Welsh may come from a great technological empire, they too have a ferocious, martial mythos to live up to, and as they sing they are becoming the mask they have made for themselves. In that time you get the feeling that they are not all that different from one another. Or as Kipling said, ""There is neither East nor West, nor border nor breed, nor birth. When two strong men come face to face, though they come from the ends of the Earth.""",1330128000,2,2500,4.628378378378378

361974,3,6301767918,"Zulu tells the story of the defence of the Oscarberg Mission at Rorke's Drift in Britain's Natal colony on 22 January 1879. Over seven hours, about one hundred British defenders held off wave after wave of determined attacks by 4,000 Zulu warriors bent upon ""wetting their spears"" in the bodies of the defenders. Eleven Victoria Crosses (VCs) were awarded to the defenders of the mission and this action became famous as the Battle of Rorke's Drift.  This much is fact; but much of the film Zulu is overlaid with fiction and distortions of history. Two leftist producers, Stanley Baker and Cy Endfield, made Zulu and what could have been a fine action film is diminished by serious distortions of history, especially in relation to the characters of people associated with the Battle of Rorke's Drift. The worst examples of these distortions are Zulu's depictions of missionary Otto Witt, Assistant Commissary James Langley Dalton VC, Private Henry Hook VC, and Lieutenant James Adendorf of the Natal Native Contingent (NNC), and I shall return to explain the nature of these distortions for those who don't like to see history turned on its head by film-makers pushing an agenda.

One of the flaws of Zulu as a story is the failure to place the film in its historical context. Surely we have to wonder what a British army was doing in the independent kingdom of Zululand in 1879! Producers Baker and Endfield do not tell us. The British acquired Capetown and Cape Colony from the Dutch in 1814 for two million pounds. The original Dutch settlers, called Boers, were harsh masters to the native people and when the British abolished slavery in 1833, many Boer farmers left Cape Colony and trekked north where they settled the Orange Free State, Transvaal, and drove British settlers out of Natal. The Zulus found themselves effectively surrounded by hostile Boers and the two races engaged in constant warfare until the British reoccupied Natal and annexed Transvaal with the consent of the bankrupt Boer administration. There had been good relations between the Zulus and British in South Africa from 1814 because the Zulu kings were aware that they had good friends and support in Britain, particularly from the powerful missionary lobby and liberals. Two men were responsible for producing warfare between the British and Zulus in 1879. Zulu custom denied men marriage until they had ""washed their spears"" in human blood. With British territory now surrounding Zululand, warriors had limited opportunities to ""wash their spears"" without entering friendly British lands to kill Boers. The Zulu king Cetshwayo had an increasingly restive army of 40,000 warriors and many of them were young men who could not marry until they had ""washed their spears"". The British High Commissioner for South Africa, Sir Henry Bartle Frere, was made aware of the concerns of settlers in British colonies bordering Zululand who feared Zulu attacks. Frere was warned by Cetshwayo that peace was causing his army to become restive, and Frere reacted by ordering Cetshwayo to disband his army and abolish the Zulu custom that denied marriage to men until they had ""washed their spears."" Cetshwayo ignored the order, and Frere responded by ordering his army commanded by Lord Chelmsford to invade Zululand and destroy the Zulu army. Because the tracks into Zululand were very narrow, Chelmsford split his army into three columns which entered Zululand along separate tracks all leading to Cetshwayo's great kraal at Ulundi. Chelmsford commanded the centre column which set up a base supply depot at the Oscarberg Mission which was located in Britain's Natal Colony and only half a mile from a ford crossing the Buffalo River known as Rorke's Drift. The Buffalo River provided a border between the Natal Colony and Zululand. After crossing the Buffalo River, the weather became foul and Chelmsford's column made slow progress over roughly ten miles to the mountain called Islandlwana. Here Chelmsford established a forward camp and split his column. He left Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Pulleine in command at Islandlwana while he went off to track down rumoured massing of Zulus elsewhere. Unknown to Chelmsford, a massive Zulu army was hidden close to Islandlwana and preparing to attack his camp. Pulleine's defences were scattered by the reckless behaviour of Lieutenant Colonel Anthony Durnford who defied orders from Chelmsford to remain with Pulleine at islandlwana and took a force out independently to hunt for Zulus.  When Durnford's force was cut off by the Zulus, he called on Pulleine for help and Pulleine felt obliged to weaken his own force by sending reinforcements to Durnford. The dispersed British at Islandlwana were no match for the massive Zulu army. The combined forces of Pulleine and Durnford at Islandlwana amounted to 1,774 all ranks. Of these, 1329 died at the hands of the Zulus who showed no mercy.

The Oscarberg Mission at Rorke's Drift should not have been attacked after the massacre at Islandlwana.  The mission was located in Natal and Cetshwayo had forbidden his regiments to enter the British colony of Natal. He had also forbidden his regiments to attack any fortified place such as the Oscarberg Mission at Rorke's Drift . The three regiments that attacked the Oscarberg Mission, numbering at least 4,000 warriors, had been required to circle around behind the mountain at Isandlwana and when they finally arrived at the British camp the massacre was complete and they had no opportunity to ""wash their spears"". These three disgruntled regiments hunted for survivors, crossed into Natal, and followed the Buffalo River down to Rorke's Drift. They were led by Dabulamanzi, Cetshwayo's brother, who was so anxious to distinguish himself in battle that he was prepared to disobey Cetshwayo's orders not to enter Natal and not to attack fortified buildings.

The Officer Commanding at Rorke's Drift on the afternoon of 22 January 1879 was Lieutenant John Rouse Merriott Chard, Royal Engineers. Producer Stanley Baker plays Chard in Zulu. Chard had been at Rorke's Drift for ten days preparing to build a fortification to protect the vital crossing and keeping an eye on the work of a fatigue party from the column securing cables for the ferry crossing. Chard did not meet Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, Officer Commanding B Company, 2nd Battalion, Twenty-Fourth Foot at the Buffalo River crossing as depicted in the film Zulu.  Michael Caine plays Bromhead in the film. They had known each other for ten days and were on friendly terms. As the senior officer by three years, Chard had been left in command at Rorke's Drift by Brevet Major Henry Spalding who had gone off to a nearby farm known as Helpmakaar to bring up another company to strengthen the garrison at Oscarberg Mission. Chard was at the Buffalo River supervising his ferry working party when he was informed of the massacre at Islandlwana by Lieutenant James Adendorf of the Natal Native Contingent (NNC) who claimed to have escaped the Zulus on horseback. Chard immediately ordered a water cart filled and returned with his working party from the Buffalo River to the mission and set about strengthening its defences with the expert advice of Assistant Commissary James Langley Dalton, an experienced soldier who had retired and then volunteered for the Commissariat service when war against the Zulus appeared imminent. Adendorf is depicted by the film-makers as a critically important adviser to Chard and Bromhead on Zulu warfare tactics throughout the battle at Rorke's Drift. Historians disagree concerning Adendorf's role, if any, in the defence of the Oscarberg Mission. Michael Glover claims in his book ""Rorke's Drift-A Victorian Epic"" (1975) that Adendorf quietly slipped away before the Zulu attack and was later arrested in Pietermaritzburg. Apparently based on Chard's listing of Adendorf as one of the defenders of the Mission, and without citing any other evidence in support, Ian Knight assumes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rorke-s-Drift-1879-Pinned-like-rats-in-a-hole-Campaign/dp/1855325063/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rorke's Drift 1879: 'Pinned like rats in a hole' (Campaign)</a>&nbsp;that Adendorf was present during the Zulu attack.

Zulu opens after the titles with a spectacular mass marriage ceremony at Ulundi witnessed by King Cetshwayo (played by Zulu Chief Buthelezi), Pastor Witt (Jack Hawkins) and his adult daughter Margareta (Ulla Jacobsson). Pastor Witt is heard to describe the Zulus to Margarita as ""a great people"". This description appears to be intended by the film-makers to cause us to forget the historical background and to question the morality of the British invasion of Zululand. The ceremony is interrupted by news of the massacre at Isandlwana. Amid Zulu rejoicing, Cetshwayo allows Witt and his daughter to leave.  If such a mass marriage ceremony actually took place at this time, Pastor Witt and Margareta were not there to see it. At this time, Witt was standing on top of the mountain Oscarberg which overlooked his mission and he was acting as a lookout for Chard. When he sighted a large mass of Zulus heading for his mission, Witt reported this fact to Lieutenant Chard and then left the mission to join his wife and three young children who had left some days earlier. The drunken, raving, and obstructive behaviour attributed to Pastor Witt in the film is an invention of the film-makers. Margareta's presence at the time of the Zulu attack on the mission is also an invention. The desertion of 100 native NNC soldiers from the mission at the urging of Pastor Witt is also an invention. The native soldiers deserted in a body when a troop of one hundred well mounted and armed native cavalry, known as the Sikhali Horse, refused to stay and assist in the defence of the vital mission stores and galloped off to safety.

The three Zulu regiments began their attacks in human waves beginning at about 5 pm on 22 January 1879. Having provided expert advice on the fortifying of the mission, Assistant Commissary Dalton VC played a gallant role in the defence of the hospital both as a rifleman and in rallying the hard-pressed defenders. While defending the hospital, he was wounded by a Zulu sniper on the Oscarberg. In the film, Dalton is depicted as an effeminate character who does nothing more useful than drag a box of cartridges from soldier to soldier before he is wounded. The film viewer is left wondering how Dalton could have earned a VC. This demeaning of Dalton's crucial contribution to the defence of the Oscarberg mission is an appalling reflection on producers Baker and Enfield. However, the film-makers scale new heights of crass historical distortion in their depiction of Private Henry Hook VC.  In the film, Hook (James Booth) is depicted as a patient in the hospital, a thief, a malingerer, and an insubordinate soldier who only reluctantly assists in the defence of the hospital when the Zulus break in. In fact, Hook was a model soldier and nothing like the man depicted in Zulu. Hook was one of several soldiers assigned by Chard to defend the hospital and its patients. His gallantry in defence of the hospital and its patients earned him his VC. His descendants were so deeply offended by the depiction of Hook as a scoundrel that they walked out of the theatre.

The last Zulu attack was beaten off by the defenders at about midnight and the Zulus then left Rorke's Drift and did not return. The film suggests that the Zulu attacks started much earlier in the day, continued throughout the night, and that the final attack was beaten off after sunrise on the morning of 23 January. This did not happen, but we can make allowance for this artistic licence because night attacks are difficult to film and repeated night attacks would be likely to bore audiences.

The film-makers underline their anti-war credentials with implausible comments attributed to Surgeon Reynolds, and Lieutenants Chard and Bromhead. During the Zulu attacks, Surgeon Reynolds is heard to say to Chard: ""Damn you, Chard! Damn all you butchers!"" There is no historical support for such an attitude or comment. At the end of the film, Chard is heard to declare his disgust at what the British have done in defending the Oscarberg Mission. Bromhead then makes the unlikely comments that he feels ""sick"" and ""ashamed"" by what has happened at the mission. The historical distortions in Zulu go well beyond artistic licence and young viewers deserve to be told about these distortions.",1325203200,12,12565,5.126403123474866

However, the context of the British being the ""good guys"" is off.  It just so happens that the British started the Zulu war by attempting to forcibly annex Zulu territory and the Zulus were attempting to hold on to what was rightfully theirs under a treaty with the British.  The movie reminds me very much of the old west movies where the cavalry and the cowboys are the good guys and the Indians are the bad.

361977,5,6301767918,"After giving this movie a bit of thought and and having spoken about it with a university professor friend of mine, who called it ""profound,"" I cannot help but think of the deeper, more underlying consequences of this movie and what it is trying to say. I will try to grasp some major points in a nutshell:

1) Us Welsh would rather be singing than fighting for King and Country any day. Yes, that is subtly portrayed here, but when duty calls, well, we fight.

2) The Zulus are portrayed as a proud people, who will listen to and obey their leader. (Here, in this movie, an old man/chief on top of a mountain, basically directing the battle below.) And they fight bravely most likely to defend their homeland, their dignity, and their self-respect. (Does that sound like any other battles of which you may have heard?)

And 3) That despite our differences: racial, cultural, spiritual, please name any divisive element, as you well know that humankind can, that human beings can, may, and will transcend their differences, if they are able to unite in song. It sounds rather simple, doesn't it? Or perhaps even a little naive, but, I think, after multiple viewings and thinking about what the message of this movie is really trying to convey, perhaps it is just that: we can unite, we can be brothers, if maybe we could listen to what we each of us have to offer each other. And here in this movie, that message of brotherhood and understanding is conveyed by the medium of song. At least, that is how these ""warriors"" come to a conclusive ""truce,"" that is, at least a cessation of their hostilities (and then, most likely, a return home to the wife and kids). The Welsh regiment stands strong with a rousing version of ""Men of Harlech,"" and the Zulus sing one of their songs, which, I am sorry to say, I cannot describe by title.

This movie IS British. It does have a message to say. Anti-war? Yes! Anti-futility? Yes! Pro-song? A double yes on that one!

There is some fine ensemble acting here. Michael Caine in his first cinematic role; Welsh actor Stanley Baker looking and acting like a more serious John Cleese; James Booth as the representative English malcontent, Hook, bitter and caustic on the outside, fighting spirit on the inside; the late, great character actor, Jack Hawkins, and some other fine (and non-British) acting talent. How can one be disappointed with such acting? And, of course, who else to ""wrap up"" a seemingly, more-or-less, Welsh saga, than to have Richard Burton provide final commentary as epilogue?

And, of course, there is the stunning scenery of South Africa filmed on location. No, it's not Bala, arguably the most famous lake in Wales, as one Welsh regimental soldier laments, with the ground ""not good enough to hold a man in his grave,"" but nevertheless stunning.

And, music by John Barry, too (of Bond/007 fame). Can't beat that with a stick.

I have watched this movie a number of times, on TV and on VHS. Blu-ray is much, much better (I have not seen it on standard DVD, though). I recommend it as a great war film. As history, it is Hollywood. If it weren't so deficient in that respect I would give it five stars.

The scenery, and the photography in general, are breathtaking. The Zulus are portrayed with respect, by Zulu actors. The British are mostly realistic army types, individuals with complex motives and not a few ""characters"". (I am partial to Nigel Green as Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne, although as portrayed he is mostly fictional.) Two scenes are as stirring as anything I have seen in cinema; the defenders responding to Zulu chanting by singing ""Men of Harlech""; and, the Zulu salute to the British before they abandon the siege for good. Unfortunately, neither actually happened.

There are other significant historical inaccuracies, some of which are central to the plot. A representative few:  The actual defenders of Rorke's Drift were not predominately Welsh (32 of the 97 whose nationalities are known). ""Men of Harlech"" was not even the regimental song at the time, it was ""The Warwickshire Lad"". British casualties were caused by gunfire, not the Zulu iklwa (short spear); however, the attackers could not have had rifles captured at Isandlwana, although they did have older firearms. There was no conflict between Lieutenants Chard and Bromhead over command, Chard was formally left in charge by their superior. Lastly, most of the key characters are the victims of artistic license, in some cases altered beyond recognition. That includes Bourne, who was actually the youngest colour sergeant in the army and short. The missionary Witt resembles the real man only in name and occupation. Private Hooks' daughters famously stalked out of the preview in 1964, because their father was filmed as a drunken malingerer when the actual Hook was a teetotaler and a model soldier.

The movie is rated PG (2008). I would not show it to a child under 10, but by today's standards it is pretty tame. There is a lot of violence, of a sanitized variety common in early 1960s films. Women dance bare breasted in a Zulu mass wedding. The missionary Otto Witt remarks to his (fictional) buttoned-up adult daughter that it is something she needs to get used to if she is to stay in Africa.",1318982400,5,2612,4.8475336322869955

 I saw this movie first at a drive-in when I was all of 9 years old. I have watched it tens of times on TV, purchased 2 VHS, and then 2 DVD versions. I thought the copy quality was outstanding on the last DVD version only to be stunned by the level of detail and additional footage in this blu-ray.

 I can honestly say that there are things in this movie I never saw in any other version and that the picture quality makes it seem like a brand-new movie.

 Here's the story:

 Start with the year 1879. Britain is flexing its Imperial muscle in South Africa by invading the lands controlled by the Zulu. Because the Zulu are Blacks, the British commander, Lord Chelmsford, split his force into three columns. One of the columns, comprised mostly of the 24th Regiment of Foot, is attacked and annihilated by a supposedly inferior force of Zulu warriors that carry only a shield and two spears.

 The Zulus then turn their attention to a supply depot and crossing point called Rorke's Drift garrisoned by roughly 140 men, commanded by a green lieutenant Bromhead, played by Michael Caine. When the attack comes, a more senior lieutenant of Engineers, Chard, played by Stanley Baker, who was trying to build a bridge for the destroyed column takes command.

 A telling remark is in reference to the Blacks and Zulus made after Lt. Bromhead damns them as ""cowardly"": ""And just who do you think is coming to destroy your little command? The Grenadier Guards?""

 Think that a horde of spear-bearing half-naked ""savages"" would be no competition for the British and their rifles?

 You're making the same mistake that Chelmsford did historically and Bromhead's character did in this film.

362034,5,6301767918,"I am a 64 year old American who, luckily, has never been in a war, let alone a battle of the magnitude and one-sidedness of the one at Rorkes Drift (If my spelling is incorrect, I sincerely apologize
!) in 1879 - fought by extremely brave soldiers on both sides!

But, I have made a life-long hobby of the study of great battles, war films, and military history...and, I can tell you straight out that ""Zulu"" is one of the greatest, if not THE GREATEST recounting
of a battle to ever grace the silver screen (The Alamo notwithstanding - in fact, no version of THAT film even comes close to giving us an insider's view of what just a few men in the direst of circumstances can accomplish, given the proper leadership and motivation of their superiors, and their own will to survive - their
""just plain guts"" attitude when all seems lost and one's back is not just against the wall, but partially inside it!

I have watched this film on VHS so many times, I cannot give you a reasonably close count, but there were very many...and not once, NOT ONCE!, did I ever grow bored with this movie, with the actual history of the period, of the cultural clashes made so vivid and brutal and uplifting by this beautifully filmed and directed movie!

Even for those who don't like watching battle movies, this one is a must-see, because it is a historical accounting on film of a real event, filmed nearly on location in what has to be one of the most beautiful landscapes ever to grace a movie screen.  Perhaps, that
great clash of Rommel's and Patton's forces in North Africa during WWII, so wonderfully re-enacted in ""Patton"", with George C. Scott,
such a superior actor!, comes fairly close to the one in ""Zulu"", but
is way too short a scene to compare to the long-running clash depicted in South Africa in 1879!

The acting is superb!  Michael Caine's first movie role is brilliant!
Anthony Baker and Nigel Green are absolutely wonderful.  Hooke's character, whether true-to-life or partially made-up for the film,
is incredibly moving!  And all the actors, from my man Jack Hawkins,
to the Zulu king, from the brave Welshmen privates to the cook doling
out ammunition with a bullet in his chest, to the doctor railing against war while dealing with the dying over a very bloody put-together surgical table while a raging battle is going on at his very doorstep...all this and more make this film one of the most compelling in the silver screen repertoire!

Even ""Saving Private Ryan"", so powerful and moving and right for the times, acted with such monumental force by Tom Hanks, Matt Damon
and a host of very fine other actors, except at the very end of the film, doesn't come near to what goes on during much of ""Zulu""!
And, that's saying a lot - because I absolutely loved SPR and Patton!

See this film!  See it twice!  And, if you are a movie buff, I would bet the house that you will still be watching it over and over and over as the years rush by!  It is that good!

Were all battle movies made so well, without the politics, without
the flag-waving, without the John Wayne-ish or Ronald Reaganish
baloney added to cover up the death scenes which almost equate to
having a stale kitchen breakfast while still yawning from a poor night's sleep!

Yes, there are other great war and battle films out there - see ""Gladiator"", as another example to the three mentioned above - but, ""Zulu"" is and always will be my favorite!

Great picture quality and great sound. This should be what buying a high def blu ray is all about.

So when I see a movie where the task at hand is to build a bridge over a river, only to see in camera angles that the river consists of a tiny stream, damned by some rocks to make a small pond... and the fighting scenes don't look real, with actors looking at the camera. Yet this film works because of the splendid acting and directing that came with this film. I have seen this movie in many formats... but the Blu-ray copy lays bare the naked simplicity of special effects of that time with the amazing quality of the film stock used. When you watch this movie remember it's not about the special effects but rather a reenactment of an actual event ""employing"" hundreds (perhaps thousands) of actors playing in the ""open"" under unpredictable conditions.

362106,5,6301767918,"I may not be able to add much to the reviews, whose praise I agree with wholeheratedly on the content of this magnificent film, but I still felt compelled to offer my two cents on the BluRay, which is equally fantastic. With the full measure of the gloriousness of the sheer granduer of the backdrop for this story now rightfully restored in HiDef, the inherent drama of the storyline now, finally, at long last, has an equally worthy canvas on which to be presented - a fact that's been perpetually lost on every other video presentation of it I've seen before. It is actually an awe-inspiring revalation as to the intended impact of this film and, from any and all previous video editions of it, indeed a transformation from a first-rate adventure of otherwise acceptably good scale to a first-rate adventure and overall a remarkable spectacle! I dare say it didn't approach looking this good to me when I recall seeing it in my local theater all those years ago. For that matter, it looks so good, I don't think anyone would dream, from its appearance here, that this film is in fact closing in on its 50th anniversary. From the opening credits, I see that the film was originally shot in 70mm, thus with far more detail than the more common 35mm films films have. You can expect similar performance in HiDef with other films of the 65 or 70mm variety, like 2001: A Space Odessy or Lawrence of Arabia - IF the disc transfer is good - and here it certainly is. The image within the frame on this disc is always, and utterly, as steady as the Rock of Gibralter. There was only the very most minor amount of flicker, as seen on my setup, but, again, only rarely and scarcely noticable when it was seen - still not sure if the disc was actually to blame or not. Not a hint of moire, anywhere.

The sound is quite good and far better than I had any reason to hope. Although John Barry's superb score was apparently originally in mono, it's by far the best I've heard from it before - it even has a better impression than the original (mono) soundtrack available on CD, if my memory serves. Yet, the sound effects track on this disc is either true stereo, or, more likely, was derived from various isolated sound effects elements and then ""panned"" during post production. There are even some nice extras: more than two documentaries on the making of the film, film commentary, the theatrical trailer and even a brief, but interesting, interview with John Barry himself, pertaining to the origins of his ideas for the score. But, all in all, I do love it so when such a majestic and monumental movie as this gets the royal treatment that it does here. Sometimes, presentation is everything! Highly, highly recommended!!",1306108800,10,2715,4.58641975308642
362156,5,6301767918,"This movie, Micheal Caine's first starring role, will probably come across as outdated to many younger first time viewers.

Those killed in the battle scenes don't bleed when speared, bashed on the head or shot at point blank range. And the mortally wounded people falling down dead tend to do so in a way that is clearly contrived. That alone will probably amuse many people brought up on today's more realistic, graphic special effects.

The script is also quite dated in places. There are quite a few lines that will no doubt amuse or exasperate younger audiences. There are other lines that will have the political correctness police out in full force.

But despite those limitations, this is still a first class war movie.

The plot is based on a real event at Rourke's Drift (in present day South Africa) during the 1879 Zulu War. The attack by over 4000 Zulus against an isolated outpost manned by about 100 British troops is an historic fact. 13 Victoria Crosses were awarded to the defenders.

My favorite scene is toward the end, on the morning of the second day of battle, when the two sides are preparing for battle. The Zulus warriors are lined up along the crest of a hill overlooking the British positions and are singing Zulu war songs (real Zulu battle songs, sung by real Zulus; this movie was quite accurate in that respect) while the Welsh troops in the British positions are singing the old Welsh battle song Men of Harlech (actually a version of Men of Harlech written specifically for this movie; the original Men of Harlech is much longer than the movie version) to counter the Zulus` singing.

It`s a great scene. No other war movie I`ve seen has the two opposing sides singing at each other before the final battle.

Great movie, despite being somewhat dated.",1303862400,3,1785,4.720257234726688

Shot on location in Natal, ZULU has all of the requisite elements one would expect from a historical epic.
Spectacular locations, sweeping vistas and a huge cast. Starring Stanley Baker and the newcomer Michael Caine, it also has thousands of the local Zulu tribesman in the film- with Mangosuthu Buthelezi playing his great Grandfather Cetchwayo, son of Shaka Zulu.

Historically accurate- with some liberties, of course- ZULU is  beautifully shot-  the Criterion remastering done on this years ago holds up beautifully on the BluRay, and is a well acted, extremely convincing film.

Every shot is like a picture postcard.

You could not beat Michael Caine as the arrogant Infantry Officer, nor the support of Jack Hawkins, Stanley Baker, the other characters. Personally, I could easily Identify with Color Sergent Bourne who was played by Nigel Green-he was the quintessential English solider and reflected well the British Army of 1879.
The acting by all was superb.
Not that the writers ( Cy Edenfield and John Prebble) lacked either.
Reading the original account ( It's a real story folks!) left little to the imagination, but seeing the movie made you feel the desperation,fear, and smell the gun smoke. I know that there are some inaccurate portraits and artistic license taken , but those viewing should note that this is a movie, not a history lesson. Further, until the movie came out, I doubt that any American had heard of Rorkes Drift, much less the battle that ensued there.
It was a great story-telling experience when I first saw it in a movie house in England, and again on the Television.
So I bought it-this time in Blue ray. Seeing it the third time was just as good as seeing it the first....and worth seeing again.

362159,5,6301767918,"METACOM was a minor VHS company that specialized in operatic and ballet performances. They also had a small catalog of public domain motion pictures.

In this epic's opening titles, Michael Caine is billed with ""introducing"" despite his having been in many previous movies, including five credited roles.

ZULU is the true story of a garrison of less than 140 British (Welsh) troopers who in January of 1879 successfully stand at Rourke's Drift against an army of 4,000 South African natives. Once they begin, attacks are relentless and terrifying. Commanding officer John Chard (Baker) later gives credit for their not being overwhelmed and decimated to the Henry short chamber rifle, but the truth is, it was the stout heart and determination of these soldiers that prevailed, when previously 1,500 of their comrades had fallen.

One of the greatest war movies ever made, this is an unforgettable tribute to some of the bravest men to ever take up arms for Queen and country.

Those who have a fascination for Africa in general and southern Africa in particular, will yield even more pleasure. Those who rejoice in the rhythmic chanting of African warriors will feel their spines tingle. Those who have been in the British military, especially as a private soldier, will recognize that the humour they often experienced, particularly in the face of danger, has been available for a long, long time. The other revelation of course is Michael Caine's first starring role and a terrific debut it was. The Welsh dimension is quietly significant. It's a wonderful film.

The music and the African battle chants are a rousing part of this epic.
The chanting/singing exchange between the soldiers and the Zulu warriors makes this movie one of the few classics that is inspirational
I was pleased with the quality in comparison to a DVD I had purchased a few years ago. A very bad transfer to DVD
The Blu Ray is excellent with good color and detail. Only one thing annoyed me a little but I overlooked it later. Jack Hawkins appearance was too soft in detail and the wrinkles of his face were smoothed out giving it an artificial plaster look that could pass for too much make up.

362229,5,6301767918,"I had purchased the Paramount dvd release of ""Zulu"" a couple of years back. I think it is one of the best dvd presentations of an older title available.  There were several articles reviewing a blu-ray release of ""Zulu"". A search of Amazon products listed under ""Zulu"" revealed a blu-ray disc of the film.  It was only available through ""sellers"" in the ""Amazon marketplace"". I was dubious about buying an imported blu-ray disc.  I took a chance and purchased the UK blu-ray ""Zulu"" for $17.31. ""Zulu"" arrived one business day after another disc, purchased directly from Amazon,and ordered at the same time. At least I had gotten a disc for my money. However, would it play on my American OPPO blu-ray player? Yes, the disc played. Yes, the quality is better than any movie I have seen from that time period including the wonderful blu-ray disc of the 1st James Bond film, ""Dr. No"".  There are also extras including a commentary audio track.

Did I really need to spend another $18.00 on a film that I already owned and considered an excellent transfer?  I have good a/v equipment.  I want to see all films I admire in the very best presentation available.  With the Blu-ray version of ""Zulu"", my expectation, for the most part, were met.

This is especially evident given the marginal quality of the previously available DVDs.  My copy was obtained from Amazon UK.  I had been concerned that because it was PAL format that I might have some difficulty viewing it in North America, but after reading several threads on Amazon.com where people said that region-free Blu-rays from Britain worked fine on North American equipment, I decided to give it a try.  And sure enough, there was no problem at all with playing Zulu on my Panasonic BD60 player and Panasonic plasma television.

The sound quality on Zulu Blu-ray is very good, considering that it is just a stereo track.  The disc has several extras that are of interest to film history buffs.  One minor quibble is that visual effects suffer from the increased clarity of the picture on a large screen, especially the numerous but almost bloodless charges of the Zulus into the rifle fire of the British defenders.

The acting is wonderful and Michael Caine is just superb as Lieutenant Gonville Broomhead. You have 139 British soldiers against 4000 Zulus in a war setting and you, the spectactor, are on pins and needles. You can't wait to see the outcome.  There is suspense, great action scenes, heated battle and bloodshed, but it's the pathos of the men in the thick of it all that keeps you on edge as does their very PROPER British conduct in the midst of the most improper of circumstances.

This WESTLAKE ENTERTAINMENT version is very high quality.  A  pristine PERFECT negative! No scratches or defects whatsoever.  The colours and definition are exquisite and this is the widescreen, ""letterbox"" edition, so you get to see the version director Cy Endfield intended.  Richard Burton provides an excellent, albeit brief narration. The music, by the way, is absolutely inspiring and brilliant, composed by the legendary John Barry (""You Only live Twice, James Bond Theme""). It's a mix of Zulu tribal dance and triumphant British Victorian. All in all an uplifting movie of great heroism.  I thoroughly recommend this exciting 1964 Joseph E.

To this end, and the fact that the movie stands on it's own merits, it is in no need of further praise as a movie, so my review will specifically talk about the Blu Ray version, and the sound and picture quality.

IMPORTANT NOTE - This disc is region 0 and will play on ANY Blu-ray machines ANYWHERE. Is is however PAL format and will require a compatible TV (most modern TV's can do both NTSC and PAL)

Many movies transferred onto Blu-Ray look good, often better than the original DVD release, which one would expect.
Not unlike last years James Bond re released frame by frame restored movies, Zulu on Blu-Ray is one of the best transfers I have ever seen (and I watch a lot of movies).
The rich colors and clarity of detail are awesome, but the picture shows incredible depth as well.
Compared to the MGM regular DVD release it is framed at 2.25:1 and has some signs of slight cropping at the very edges, aside from this there are no real differences, except the that the improvements are immense.

Consider for a moment that this picture is over 45 years old, blink, look away and then look again.

For those who like numbers the feature takes up around 35GB of the used 40GB space.
The bitrate is 35.1, which is almost 5 times that of the MGM DVD region 1 release.
Sound is crisp and clean but only 2.0 due to the original soundtrack being transferred across.
Commentary, two featurettes, and a couple of trailers round out the extra's

It truly was inspiring to watch as the British did not begin fighting until the Zulu warriors were within one hundred yards of their lines.  The hand-to-hand combat definitely favored the visitors.  At the end, only a handful of British soldiers were left standing because the home team appreciated their fight and determination in trying to win.

I opted for standard shipping, and received the disc in the mail ten days after I placed the order. As for playback, the disc is Region-free and plays fine on U.S. Blu-ray players. I was enthused by the reviews I'd seen on the Amazon U.K. site and I was not disappointed-- the picture quality of this Blu-ray transfer is superb!

In fact, the running time of the film on this Blu-ray disc is the longer 138 minutes, something I confirmed by observing the time code on the on-screen display. Rest assured that you are watching the full, unedited version of Zulu when you purchase this disc!

In addition to the film, there are some special features on the disc:
1. A commentary on the film by Second Unit Director Robert Porter and film historian Sheldon Hall (author of a book on the movie)
2. A short piece on the music of Zulu, featuring an interview with composer John Barry
3. A retrospective on the movie, featuring the aforementioned Sheldon Hall
4. Two documentaries (actually one documentary in two parts) on the making of Zulu, featuring reminiscences by surviving cast members and the widows of star Stanley Baker & co-screenwriter John Prebble
5. The original theatrical trailer

It is one of those classics that you can sit through time and time again and, I believe at one point, Playboy rated this the ultimate number one ""guy"" movie while placing Gone with the Wind as the ultimate number one ""gal"" movie.

This Blu-ray version is the first version I have ever seen of an older movie that gets five stars for the transfer to Blu-ray.  I was shocked when I fired up the Blu-ray player and threw this DVD in.  The transfer is flawless.  The detail is amazing and is the best transfer of any movie I have ever seen.  I can not emphasize enough the quality of this transfer.  If you are hesitating the purchase because you are unsure the cost will be worth the quality, whip out that credit card because you are in for a wonderful experience.

362317,5,6301767918,"It's the morning of Jan. 22, 1879, and most of the British soldiers left behind to garrison the small makeshift hospital/supply depot of Rorke's Drift probably consider themselves lucky. It looks like they won't have to fight in this campaign. Their comrades who have marched on to Isandlwana will whip the Zulus in a few days and the army will march back to a hero's welcome at Capetown! Little do they know that an unforseen turn of events will have them fighting for their lives before the day is out. This turn of events, and how the men respond to it, are the subject of the movie ""Zulu"".

  As the men are going about their mundane tasks, the astounding news comes that the British force at Isandlwana has been almost wiped out. An overwhelming force of Zulus are now headed for Rorke's Drift. Next comes the realization that it's too late to try and escape. The oncoming Zulus are almost certainly so close that they'd overtake them before they could reach safety. Their only chance is to use whatever time remains to fortify their little outpost and hold out until they are rescued. If all this isn't bad enough, Boer calvary refuse their desperate pleas for help, and native troops desert en masse just as the attack begins, leaving their just completed perimeter dangerously thin. But the officers, neither of whom have seen combat before, refuse to despair. Struggling against fear and self doubt, they make adjustments in the face of the enemy attack, pushing themselves and their men to the limits of endurance. The men, though aware of the seeming hopelessness of the situation, remain resolute. The Zulus, too, press on, refusing to quit even though taking terrible casualties from superior firepower. As the battle continues,truths about human character are revealed. Some of the most unlikely individuals show themselves to be capable of extraordinary heroism. Others find out how stupid and superficial their biases are when judging a persons true character. One or two find that they can't stand up to the situation.

  In the end, the British are rescued. But the movie isn't really about victory or defeat. ""Zulu"" is a visual hymn of praise to courage, unselfishness, and dogged determination in the face of mortal danger.

362410,5,6301767918,"_Zulu_ (1964) is an epic film depicting the battle between the British and the Zulus, a black tribe in South Africa, in January 1879 in South Africa.  The film begins with a mass Zulu marriage ceremony watched over by a British missionary and his daughter.  In this ceremony, each woman is wed to a brave warrior.  However, during the ceremony a messenger appears and informs the Zulu king that there has been a great victory in which the Zulus have killed thousands of British.  With this, the clergyman and his daughter ride off back to the British hold-out.  It is here that the British captains plot their last stand against the Zulus.  The British only have 100 men while the Zulus have thousands.  And, one of the British soldiers point out that the Zulus attack in the form of a water buffalo.  One of the men held in the brig with several others is known as Hook, a malingerer who is later to show great courage.  The film then shows the British preparing for battle to the protests of the clergyman.  While the battle becomes imminent the clergyman begins crying out that ""Thou shalt not kill!"" and thus it becomes necessary to lock him away.  The Zulus first appear as sharpshooters having taken the guns from fallen British soldiers.  Following this initial attack, a group of Zulu soldiers appear carrying spears and shields.  However, they are quickly dispatched by the British army.  Then, it is suddenly noted that the Zulu king has only unleashed this group to test the firepower of the British and that they gladly die.  Instantly, appears a second wave of Zulus much larger than the first and the battle commences.  The film shows some of the ridiculous and silly features of the British army (part of the reason for their lack of success) and thus is unintentially funny.  To begin with the army appears to be excessively caught up in minor regulations.  While they could certainly use the men in the brig (having only 100 men to fight thousands), it is noted that ""this is against Queen's regulations"".  Secondly, the British appear in ridiculous looking red coats dressed more as if they are in a parade than a battle.  Thirdly, the British carry bayonets; however, these must be re-loaded every time they are fired.  And, finally the British are regimented in such a manner that they appear in straight lines, while the Zulus appear more as a guerilla force.  As the battle continues, many Zulus are shot, but many British begin to be killed.  Finally, Hook and the men in the brig must come out and fight.  Even one of the British captains is injured but manages to live.  Eventually the British manage to defeat this wave of the Zulu army.  However, they are left with very few men.  However, it is just at this moment when victory appears imminent that the Zulu king appears leading thousands of more warriors.  The British cower believing that with so few men they will all certainly perish.  But, instead of going to battle the Zulus begin performing a special dance.  In fact, they are saluting the British.  The film ends thus, noting the men who received the highest medal of the British army, the Victoria Cross (including Hook) for their courage that day.

I'm going to do that now, because it warrants heavy mention.

I have not yet seen the movie, but I have skimmed through several chapters.

This Blu Ray is indeed All Region.  It will play on American blu ray players, including all the bonus features.

Most notably of all: I've only seen The Dark Knight, Stargate, and Star Trek Season 1 on Blu Ray.  Zulu thus far has the absolute best picture quality of them all.

Whatever was used in digitally mastering this movie must have involved either an insanely high budget in the highest technology remastering, for the footage is almost perfect down to every inch of the screen.  A scene of a British officer against a clear blue sky has the sky looking as perfect and clear as through your own eyes.  All faces are clean and clear, nothing looks fuzzy or hazy or slightly staticky and/or slightly scratchy at all.

It's sad that this seemingly went out of print, because it is truly a credit to the Blu Ray Disc.

Movie Review:

Like almost any historical epic, painstaking effort is taken into accurately portraying the Zulu people.  Real Zulu are used as extras, in Zulu garb and gear.  We get an elaborate display in the start of a Zulu wedding ritual, being overseen by two Dutch missionaries.

The acting is decent enough, not at a level that can be criticized.

One of the major problems I have involves the obvious one of historical accuracy.  The two main characters (one played by Michael Caine) are heroicized vastly contrary to historical reports.  The drunken cynic soldier in the hospital tent was in reality, an honest man and a very disciplined, almost prudish figure.

The one thing that was really jarring in terms of jerking me out the immersion of the movie was the battle scenes.  Far unlike battle scenes I've seen from other movies, these were done with great heart, but with almost amateurish execution.

Scenes of blood and bullet/spear/sword penetration are almost completely averted by simple camera tricks and positioning, to cover the rather obvious fact much of the time that no one is actually firing or stabbing anyone else.  There are NO bulletholes and NO stab wounds at all.  Blood, when it does appear, is so bright red, it's almost pink, and looks far more like paint than blood.

Many of the stabs seem lazily done, with individual fights showing the two men awkwardly standing off and exchanging low-speed thrusts and parries, only for one of them to lunge sheepishly at the other, and push the ""blade"" quite obviously under their armpit.

This is a problem for about 90% of the battle scenes, although the up-close confrontations for the most part seem and feel quite real, especially in terms of stabbing.",1247616000,4,2865,4.762677484787019

362419,5,6301767918,"""Can a small British force withstand the onslaught of thousands of fearless, battle-hardened Zulu warriors?"" That's the question that this classic war film will answer.

Here's the situation that the Brits face at the outpost known as Rorke's Drift in South Africa. A force of about 90 British soldiers and combat engineers are ordered to defend a small missionary outpost in the heart of Zulu country during the Zulu War of 1879. The British forces at this remote outpost have received word that 1,500 members of a crack British regiment have been masscred by an indomitable force of Zulu warriors.

Besides the 90 or so able-bodied Brits at Rorke's Drift, there are about 35 sick and wounded soldiers who are being cared for by the missionaries there. When the Zulu warriors arrive, the British are stunned to discover that they are outnumbered about 40 to 1.

This film is arguably one of the best battle movies made.  It features a star-studded cast headed by Stanley Baker and Michael Caine and includes such distinguished British actors such as Jack Hawkins, Patrick Magee, and Nigel Green. John Barry's stirring soundtrack is superb, and the cinematography of the Natal countryside near where the actual battle took place is glorious.  This was one of Caine's earliest starring roles and garnered him the attention of the British film industry for his later roles in The Ipcress File and then Alfie.

362584,5,6301767918,"BLU-RAY DISC REVIEW--UPDATED JUNE 12, 2009: ""U.K. Blu-ray Disc will play on standard U.S. Blu-ray Disc players""

This review should be placed under the Blu-ray listing of ""Zulu""--but as per Amzon's rules, I have to place it here.

This is a review of the Blu-ray version of ""Zulu"".  I will not review the plot--although it is truly a masterpiece, a classic with an A-list cast, based on the true story of a small group of British soldiers defending a remote outpost, against thousands of Zulu warriors in colonial South Africa in 1879. If you have never seen this great movie, you will not be disappointed with the plot, the acting, the directing, or any other aspect of this dramatization of actual events.

For some reason, this Blu-ray was only released in Europe as a ""region-free"" disc. I was skeptical that it would play on my U.S.-sold Sony Blu-ray player (that I purchased in Nov. 2008 and in which I have not installed any software updates).  The seller assured me that it would play OK--and it did!  No problem whatsoever with the video or audio playback.

And what a picture!  The video quality is as good as any other Blu-ray that I have seen--even including the new blockbusters on Blu-ray--crystal sharp details--almost a 3-D look to the vistas and other images. The redcoats are fire-engine red.  There is no evidence of grain and the outstanding images are remarkably consistent throughout the film.  There is simply no comparison of the Blu-ray image to the previous DVD version of ""Zulu"". The audio is fine (other reviewers have complained about the sound--but, the original was mono--it's perfectly fine, in my opinion). If you are as picky as I am about upgrading your movie collection to Blu-ray, you will not be disappointed with this upgrade.

Unfortunately, this item is only for sale on Amazon through a limited number of marketplace sellers. There seems to be a constant trickle of offers from these sellers. I spent about $15 more on this disc than the usual Blu-ray purchase--but it was worth it.  Highly recommended!

Listed below is my previous review, based on the standard DVD release.

I almost did not purchase a DVD of ""Zulu"" based on the mostly negative comments (by other Amazon reviewers) regarding the quality of the video and sound transfer to DVD. Well, I took a chance--and wow!  The transfer to DVD is excellent! The format is anamorphic widescreen, enhanced for 16 x 9 large-screen, high-definition TVs. My comments are based on the Region 1, May 2003 DVD release by MGM. The DVD cover artwork is a painting (not a photo) that shows a likeness of Michael Caine in his British uniform.  There are apparently older versions or knock-offs that might be the source of those other negative comments regarding the picture quality.

I have a high-defintion TV and I am very particular about the quality of the transfer of old films (like this, filmed in 1964) to DVD.  I watched ""Zulu"" on a 46-inch Samsung high-def, LCD TV, played via a Toshiba 1080p HD DVD player.  The picture is crystal clear (I did not notice any grain or dirt), the colors perfect (good flesh tones--and the British red coats are their true bright red, not washed-out orange as another reviewer commented), and the sound is also good. If you have a high-defintion TV with surround sound, you will not be disappointed. This DVD edition of this 1964 classic is highly recommended!",1220400000,25,3388,4.820379965457685
362585,5,6301767918,"I still remember the first time I saw this film and sat riveted to the TV.  Everytime I see it again I think I'll be watching it for some favorite scenes, only to be - yep - still riveted to the TV.  There are so many good actors in good roles with well-written scenes, so well directed and filmed that it would be pointless to try to list them.  The film works on many levels, including an accurate depiction of the actual battle, a peek at a culture that has disappeared in its aboriginal form, filmmaking as storytelling, cultural conflict (in about half a dozen ways, actually), courage and survival, and on and on and on.  It's absolutely spine-tingling in the battle scenes.  This film has been #1 on my top 10 films list for decades.",1219795200,3,740,4.411764705882353
362586,5,6301767918,"""Zulu"" is a fabulous film based on a relatively minor action during the Zulu Wars in Natal during the 1870's.  The acting is uneven in places but the spectacle and glory carry the film to a full five star rating.  This is a story of the battle of Rourkes Drift, a crossing from Zululand into greater Natal.  The crossing is defended by a small number of British regulars who expect no action--they are building a bridge.

Things are about to change drastically, though.  Unbeknownst to them the Zulu have annihilated a large column of British troops and gained their rifles.  An induna of one Zulu Impi is humiliated that he didn't make the battle in time.  Against orders, he decides to make up for his tardiness by attacking Rourkes Drift.  5,000 Zulu bear down on a makeshift fort manned by scarcely 300 Brits armed with Martini-Henry single shot rifles.  The Zulu bide their time but make sure the English drink the last drops of terror.  The colorful impi, dressed in the differently colored cowhide uniforms of their various regiments, stay just out of range, singing and pounding on their shields in a terrifying display of power.

The attack comes frontally while Zulus armed with rifles set up an inaccurate fire from the overlooking heights.  Charge after charge is repelled by rifle and bayonet.  Englishmen die and Zulu are dead in heaps.  The Zulu make it to the burning hospital where they try to kill the sick and wounded soldiers.  The hospital bursts into flame and, again, Englishment and Zulu die.  The fight goes on all night and the English are constantly whittled down.

Amazingly, in the morning, the Zulu have had enough.  They signal their respect and trudge back into Zululand leaving their comrades rotting in the sun.  It's a great film, a testament to courage and a testament of what men can do when their backs are hard against the wall.

I am a big fan of the film Zulu, and have owned copies on VHS, laser disc and DVD.  This newest edition has the best video of any release, but there is no stereo sound.  Even a 6.99 off-brand edition I found a couple of years ago in a bargain bin had stereo sound as did the Criterion laser disc, so the tracks exist.  Historical spectacles, especially 70 mm efforts such as Zulu (with a John Barry score no less), loose much of their impact in mono.  To at last release a quality wide screen edition of this film but do so lacking its stereo tracks is a questionable decision for a major distributor like MGM.",1200614400,5,736,5.1

What comes across from watching this documentary is that ZULU is Stanley Baker's film. He was the star and producer. Without Stanley there would have been no Michael Caine. Without Stanley there would have been no ZULU.

So to my point: Why is Michael Caine solely brandished on the front of the DVD box cover art? His name is the only one that is mentioned. Have the movie going public forgotten Stanley Baker? I mean, he only made 115 movies! Michael Caine was an unknown when Stanley Baker cast him.

I feel this does an injustice to the film as a whole. I would like to see a little more respect shown to the creator of this film. As Chief Buthelezi said when Stanley died - ""He was the best white man I ever knew.""",1193184000,2,895,4.284023668639053

362678,4,6301767918,"...but not one of the greatest DVDs of all time, which is the only reason this is rated four stars instead of five. MGM/UA's transfer is a definite improvement over the atrocious Diamond public domain release, but compared to Paramount's Region 2 PAL disc, which includes new documentaries and original trailers, it's a poor show.

Zulu is one of those films that left an indelible impression of the unique power cinema can have on those of us who saw it on the big screen as children. Intellectually and emotionally other films may have the advantage over it, but as a purely cinematic experience Zulu is unbeatable.

Siege epics were curiously popular in the Sixties - 55 Days at Peking, El Cid, Khartoum, The War Lord, The Alamo among them - but perhaps none have quite such a hold on the public's affections as Zulu, particularly in the UK. It's a celebration of national courage (but not nationalism) with its eyes wide open. The besieged men aren't there to build empires but because it's their job - ""Because we're 'ere. There's no-one else,"" as Nigel Green's memorable Colour-Sergeant puts it to a young soldier.

It's a film with dignity on both sides of the conflict but no self-importance, it manages to extol heroism without glorifying war. It's also one of the few films to show the sheer physical arduousness of prolonged battle - it ends not with triumph and jubilation but with sheer exhaustion.

The narrative construction is deliberate and belongs to the days when films built up to a climax instead of throwing them in every ten minutes to keep the audience awake. John Prebble and Cy Endfield's script is strong, its subtle clash of egos between Stanley Baker and Michael Caine never over-emphasised and surrounded by memorable vignettes among the rank-and-file that gives the film a depth beyond the superbly handled battle scenes - Nigel Green struggling to maintain his composure as he takes the final depleted roll call, drunken missionary Jack Hawkins' truly irritating Bible-bashing unnerving a young private, Neil McCarthy's concern for a sick calf taking precedence over the ongoing battle.

Co-producer Baker was never to get (or give himself) so good an opportunity in a mainstream movie again, and nor were Endfield and Prebble (the three had previously collaborated on the terrific 1957 thriller Hell Drivers). Mention in despatches to Green, making the most of the part of a lifetime as the steady Colour Sergeant, and Gert Van Den Bergh as a Boer fighting alongside the Welsh too among a splendid cast from the days when you could still fill a regiment with memorable British character actors.

John Barry's epic score perfectly sums up the heroism and bloody turmoil without lapsing into jingoistic cliches, while Stephen Dade's superlative photography benefits from a good widescreen transfer (that said, the first appearance of the Zulus loses some of its impact even on a large widescreen TV). Definitely one to add to your collection, but you might want to go for the Paramount PAL DVD if you have a multi-region player instead. If you are stuck with Region 1, go for the MGM/UA disc.",1189036800,,3123,4.939047619047619

Two scenes always stick in my mind. One is where the Welsh out sing the Zulu with ""Men of Harlech"" and the other where after the battle, the Colour-Sergeant tells Lt. Chard that it was won with ""a rifle and bayonet with a lot of guts behind it!""

There are a few things about the real event that aren't portrayed in the film correctly.  For instance, it was not a Welsh Regiment at that time, but an English one as the 24th Regiment of Foot in 1879 was the 2nd Warwickshires, not becoming the South Wales Borderers until nearly two years after the Anglo-Zulu war ended.  Only approximately 11% of the men at Rorkes Drift were Welsh.  The cavalry didn't abandon the men at Rorkes Drift, but had initially fanned out to intercept any Zulu's but then were sent back when it was realised they were hopelessly outnumbered and their presence gave no tactical advantage.
There was no 'Men of Harlech', there was no warrior salute but that was added in to the film at the request of the Zulu chief whilst the film was in progress.
Last, but by no means least, the character of Hook in real life was not the ne'er do well portrayed in the film but was actually quite a decent character, as was the Church minister Otto Witt who had initially stayed to assist the men and kept watch for the Zulus from a nearby hill, but then had to leave, as he was concerned for his wifes safety and went to be at her side, taking a wounded officer with him as well.  Reading the mens personal accounts of the battle is quite revealing, and those accounts are freely available on the Internet now.

Even so, it is still a superb film.",1178755200,4,1614,4.410774410774411

362744,5,6301767918,"The 1964 movie was shot in such picturesque mountains, blue sky and serene countryside. The first half of the movie was a successful creation of the quiet, cozy air where 139 Welsh Infantry enjoyed one another's company in Natal, building a bridge, raising cattle and choir singing. Their blue-blood lieutenant Bromhead (Micahel Caine) could trace to his great grandfather for bravery and was amazingly laid back, induldging in hunting evry now and then. The amatuer but practical lieutenant, Chard of Engineers, could not be more different, he sensed the urgency when they received news that 1500 of the Britsh troops was killed by Zulu warriors nearby.

The Welsh characters were warmly portrayed - the brass, the tenor, the 4 Jones, the drinking thief who finally turned a valiant soldier...... How they prepared under Chad's leadership and waited for the imminent attack kept me anticipating in baited breath. Jack Hawkins, as the peaceloving reverend, was simply in the wrong spot at the wrong time.

The battle comprised a series of attacks, day and night, and was even more intriguing to watch. Chad was bold and decisive, a fast runner metaphorically, while Bromhead was watchful and tenacious, a marathon man. Each needed the other to ward off the Zulus. The Zulus were runners and true warriors. They knew war strategies and their songs, as prelude to war, both emboldened their spirits and weakened their enemies'. The beating of the shields and stomping of the feet, the echos among the warriers were a spectacle itself. It was true that the Welsh, outnumbered by the 4000 Zulus, were brave and fought off fatique and thirst. Yet the Zulus were formidable enemies who, outnumbered by machinery, stopped the bullets with their own bodies.

The last two major attacks were spectacular and ending excellent. 5 minutes before the ending you thought everthing was settled and behold, look beyond the mountain for a twist! This is a brilliantly war movie full of suspense. It was neither bloody nor brutal to watch. Before your eyes stood two different cultures whose peoples met the same destiny. Very watchable.",1170460800,10,2119,5.065902578796561
362745,5,6301767918,"This movie was released in 1964 and the first time I ever saw it was last night.  And I was stunned.  This is without a doubt one of the most spectacular movies ever made.  It's certainly now in my personal top ten.

Zulu is set at Rorke's Drift just outside of Natal Province in South Africa in 1879.  British forces had invaded Zulu territory and the previous day an entire column of roughly 1500 officers and men had been completely wiped out by several well disciplined Zulu ipmi's (roughly equivalent to an infantry division).  The next day 100 British officers and men were besieged at Rorke's Drift by another Zulu impi numbering roughly 4500 men.  Rorke's Drift was a hospital and church complex set in a valley just outside of Natal Province, and the British knew the Zulu were coming.

The movie captures the battle at Rorke's Drift just incredibly.  Although it focuses on the British side, the Zulu warriors are not portrayed patronizingly as ignorant savages as one might expect from an older film.  They were portrayed as they actually were historically, as a great people, with a very dangerous and disciplined army.  The defenders of Rorke's Drift fought heroically and an astonishing 11 Victoria Crosses were awarded among the survivors.

This was well directed by Cy Endfield.  The cinematography is stunning, great care was taken to make the Zulu chants, equipment and tactics as historically accurate as the British uniforms, equipment and tactics.  The Zulu chants preliminary to yet another charge must have psychologically crippling to their enemies and it's unbelievable hearing them in this film.  The British command was shared jointly by  Lt. John Chard of the Royal Engineers, played admirably by Stanley Baker, and Lt. Gonville Bromhead of the 24th foot, in a role in which Michael Caine first became known to the world.  Caine is phenomenal in this movie.  The other great performance, was Nigel Green's portrayal of Colour Sgt. Frank Bourne.  My only complaint with the movie is the part of Pvt. Henry Hook. played by John Booth, was just bizarre.  It's almost like he was invented as an unnecessary afterthought to provide some kind of comic relief, but fortunately that doesn't detract from the film all that much.

The movie is long, but it has to be.  Most of the first part of the movie is the men of Rorke's Drift preparing for the onslaught they know is coming.  Not since Seven Samurai have I seen a movie that does as good a job laying out the tactical situation for the battle to come.  And when the British hear the Zulu forces long before they ever come into view, the tension that builds in this part of the movie is just exquisite.  It's almost a relief when the battle finally starts.

And yes, when the battle does start, you realize this is a film made in 1964.  There's no exploding heads, severed limbs flying through the air, or great gouts of blood spurting all over.  Maybe that's not as realistic as the battle really was, but you get the idea without having to watch all the gore.  It's obvious that this was a gory battle, there's really no need to glorify that aspect of it.  The desperation of the British defenders and the bravery of their Zulu attackers is accurately portrayed without the slaughterhouse effects so common today, thank you.

And in the end, when the Zulu retreat, saluting the British as warrior equals, and the British bury the dead, comes the emotional release and human reactions from the two commanders.  Really a poignant scene at the end when they discuss the hell they just went through.

This movie will stay with me for a long time, it is truly a masterpiece.",1169769600,12,3645,4.744038155802862
362746,5,6301767918,"'Zulu' opens on January 22nd, 1879 with a pacifist missionary Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins), and his blonde daughter Margareta (Ulla Jacobsson) attending a Zulu mass marriage ceremony...

The impressive dancing and chanting takes on a different tone when the preacher discovers that Zulu forces have massacred hundreds of British troops at Iswandhlwana and are determined to destroy Rorke's Drift, an army outpost, in addition to being Witt's mission station...

The shaken reverend arrives and explains the situation to the British officers, advising an immediate evacuation... To his horror, the officers decide to withstand and defend their ammunition dump with 139 Welch infantrymen, a mixture of committed soldiers and complaining malingerers...

The haughty arrogant Lt. Bromhead (Michael Caine) is in charge, but Lt. John Chard (Stanley Baker) of the Royal Engineers - on assignment to build a bridge - takes command actually by strict seniority...

The situation becomes dramatic by the fact that Chard has had no combat experience and, on a distinguished level, he is obviously not from an aristocratic background... But urgency obliges the two officers to set up the defense of the station, deploy their men tactically, and prepare for the attack...

Then thousands of Zulus, armed with short spears and captured rifles, arrive on the grassy hilltops... Their unseen advance is announced by a threatening chanting...

And then they come into sight...

Long lines of black figures descending the green slopes of the hills, promising with the terrible clash of their shields and spears that soon they are going launch a fearless attack...

Their techniques of tribal warfare fashioned an efficient and terrifying fighting force... They begin to test the British firing power with the life of their warriors...

The British rifles cut them down and they retreat... But they come again-and again and again-each time getting closer to the station, cutting down the distance...

Every withdraw is followed by a deathly silence... It seems obviously that any of them will survive... In every disciplined attack they are less in number and ammunition...

After a long night, and at the rise of the sun, the fearful noise suddenly alerts the redcoats to another charge...

Most of the men in the infirmary were too sick or injured to help... Few are malingerers, like Private Hook (James Booth), who decides much later to take his bayonet and fights heroically in hand-to-hand combat with dozen of black warriors inside the burning building...

Outside, the exhausted soldiers prepare for what must be the last charge, but instead they hear a massed yell from the Zulus--a salute of acknowledgment to the braves as they withdraw from the scene...

The battle at Rorke's Drift was a decisive one in the British campaign to pacify South Africa for European settlers who came to force their culture upon the angry natives... As a page in British history it has the distinction of being the battle which produced the Victoria Crosses in few hours - to eleven defenders for their extreme courage - an all-time record for one military engagement...

Stanley Baker is solid as the engineer who is forced to become a combat commanding officer; Michael Caine splendid (in his first major role) as the pompous aristocrat; James Booth good enough as the guy who can easily find a reason to check himself into the hospital; Patrick Magee excellent as the calm surgeon; and Nigel Green, a sergeant of the old order, sternly watchful and understanding of his men but compassionate, as in the last move when he lines the tired and dispirited survivors up for a head count... He looks at them and quietly advises: 'Keep your voices down!'

The film is a superb account of that bloody engagement, and the fighting is shown in realistic detail... It salutes the heroism of the Zulus and the extreme courage of the redcoats...

Cy Endfield's direction gives emphasis to the physical exhaustion of nonstop killing, and the effect it has on men, making some tremble with great fear... More significantly, he avoids any explanation about the racial nature of the conflict, keeping out politics and history...

With John Barry's menacing musical score, ""Zulu"" was filmed in Natal, South Africa and Stephen Dade captured the luscious colorful landscapes and the sense of strange isolation... But the most arresting moment in the film is when Enfield's camera pans over a field carpeted with black corpses, gathered side by side or one on top of the other...",1168905600,4,4529,5.1138211382113825
362747,5,6301767918,"I remember James Booth as Private Henry Hook in this film. I think he left the greatest impression on me. There was a character for you and a most unlikely hero to boot! James Booth died in 2005 and his last film was KEEPING MUM. Where have all those years gone since ZULU was released?

This film is based on a true story about an undermanned British army outpost in nineteenth century South Africa facing an advancing force of Zulu warriors forty times greater in number.

Stanley Baker as Lt. John Chard, an engineer sent to the post to construct a bridge, takes command. Much out of his element, he commands the infantrymen relying on his dormant leadership qualities and self-doubting fortitude. How he manages that task and if he succeeds or fails is the essence of the story.

The battle scenes of the outnumbered British against the Zulu warriors are spectacularly and excitingly filmed as they try to overrun the compound. From a filmmaking standpoint, it is interesting how the Zulu warriors are portrayed in an almost more noble fashion than their counterpart British soldiers who are portrayed somewhat in a cynical manner called upon to fight for their own survival. Yet, the common British soldier comes around and demonstrates what it takes to not lose one's nerve in the face insurmountable odds and stand his ground.

John Barry's excellent score brings the intensity of the battle sequences and heroics to an almost euphoric frenzy.

362748,5,6301767918,"Umm - have just read the review by J Michael on Zulu - what film was he watching? Falling asleep watching Zulu? This would be possible only if you were raised watching films with the subtlety of a housebrick and constant, overwhelming action - tell me J Michael are Arnold Schwarzenegger movies your ideal of film pacing and action?  Zulu is a classic military action film, even handed, dramatic and with a brilliant score - and yes there are historical inaccuracies - but then if you watch American movies, Americans won every war singlehanded and didn't have aggressive, colonialist excursions into Mexico, Phillipines and Cuba.  As for Zulu being a ""western"" - guess what, the rest of the world don't need to recast their history in the terms of a simplistic film genre - this misrepresent the pyschological impact of some battles and some victories everywhere but America.  The news of the victory at Rourke's Drift came on the heels of the dreadful bloodbath of Iswandlana - where a British column was slaughtered to a man by supposed ""savages"". No wonder the press and people of England lauded the successful defence.  There is something in the British pysche that glories in defence over offence - even at Waterloo, it was the British squares that stood against the French attack that got the tears rolling and the heart swelling. See Zulu and be stirred.",1167004800,7,1362,4.832618025751073
362749,5,6301767918,"First, as an American I'd like to apologize for those reviewers taking the British Empire to task for their empire and colonies.  What nonsense in light of what U.S. troops were doing at the same time British troops were fighting at Rourk's Drift and such: pacifying the American West.  You know, Indians.  I guess it's different when it's 'your land'...

Which leads me to the first striking realization I had watching this film.  Cinematically, it's a western.  The warfare looks the same, the gap in military technology the same, and Natal looks similar to parts of Wyoming.  That said, this stands in a short list of great Westerns, inflected as it may with Union Jack accents and the old stiff upper lip.

I appreciated the relative even-handedness in acknowledging the bravery of the Zulu warriors and a couple lines suggesting the British had no reason to be there.  Reading a little on imdb, I discovered the director donated the livestock to the Zulu tribes that gave an assist, as a way to by-pass payment restrictions to people of color under apartheid; it is sad realizing that apartheid might not have been in effect had battles like Roark's Drift hadn't been consummated.  And, of all the historical inaccuracies and omissions, I wish the filmmakers would have mentioned that this Zulu contingent was an off-shoot lead by the leader's son, who was rashly disobeying the edict not to attack entrenched British units.

As an American, I can only imagine what size this battle has in the British psyche.  I imagine something like the Alamo to us (which has an almost comical regard to all but Texans in general), although the Alamo was largely a slaughter and intential martyrdom rather than a successful defense and display of tactics.

The acting is wonderful - no complaints anywhere, with the non-professional Zulus registering even more than the white actors at times.  The pacing is impressive, with the lax doldrums of a colonial assignment giving way to the awesome extended battlescenes.  And, with Halloween coming up, I'm not sure I have ever heard anything creepier than the sound of the Zulus approaching from beyond the hills (the 'train' sound).  Creepy, creepy, creepy.

A great movie.  I had the fortune to watch this the same week I saw Powell and Pressberger's The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp.  I cannot imagine two other films informing me so well about the British heart and its empire.",1161561600,10,2422,4.892156862745098
362750,3,6301767918,"The characters were wooden, the historical innacuracies myriad, and the violence not overly realistic. The only things they got right were the Zulus and the time frame. The Zulus were descendants of the actual warriors who fought in the Battle of Rorke's Drift. As for the time frame, I believe this movie must have lasted the length of the actual battle, at least 15 hours. You wouldn't believe that you could fall asleep during a Zulu attack but you can while watching this movie. So many of the battle scenes were almost completely identical- Zulus attack, Brits repeal, over and over again- that you won't lose much if you keep your finger on the fast-forward button. Still, it has its moments- I particularly liked when the Brits started singing ""Men of Harlech"", even though that not only didn't really happen, but they weren't even singing the real lyrics to the song. I was glad to see a historically significant event like the Battle of Rorke's Drift brought to film, but it left a lot to be desired. I might see this again some day, just to make sure that my initial reaction was justified. I don't expect to change my mind though.",1161043200,3,1141,4.653465346534653
362751,5,6301767918,"AN HISTORIC VIGNETTE THAT TAKES PLACE WHERE A LARGE NUMBER OF VICTORIA CROSSES WERE AWARDED  - Rorke's Drift in Natal, 1879:

In 1879 the British army was having a tough time maintaining its dominant position in Africa. 'Zulu' is a testiment to that difficulty and the typical imperialistic solutions of the time. 'Zulu' thrusts the action upon the viewer rather viscerally and the result is a memorable event.

'ZULU' IS ALL ABOUT OVERCOMING DESPERATE OBSTACLES AGAINST ALL ODDS!

In much the same fashion as at the Alamo, about a hundred British soldiers dug-in at Rorke's Drift in Natal, Africa to stand up against a superb Zulu force of about 4,000 warriors. The Zulu's had already destroyed a British force of over a 1,000 soldiers to the last man, and the much smaller Rorke's Drift outpost was next. Lt. John Chard, [Stanley Baker] a Royal Engineers officer who had been assigned to construct a bridge, assumes command of the Rorke's Drift outpost, and is determined to hold the British position there.

Lt. Gonville Bromhead, [Michael Caine] is at odds with Chard's command decisions at first, believing that a retreat from their fixed, exposed position, followed by a series of mountain pass ambushes is the way to defeat the Zulu's. There is tension, and anxiety between the two officers, and indeed anxiety is the mood everywhere among the outnumbered British defenders. Everything we see and hear shouts: LOST CAUSE! Nevertheless, the British are staying and fighting.

Reverend Otto Witt [Jack Hawkins] with his daughter Margareta Witt [Ulla Jacobsson] are first seen witnessing a Zulu mass marriage ceremony where they find out about the defeat of the large British column. They rush to Rorke's Drift to evacuate the sick and wounded, but manage only to make a drunken spectacle instead, which only increases the growing tension around the outpost. After the missionaries are physical expelled from Rorke's Drift by Chard, empty-handed, the siege and battle begins in earnest. The rest, is history: extraordinary, dramatized, and exceptionally well-played.

Richard Burton does an excellent job narrating, and his Welch accent and origin appropriately matches the soldiers. At the end, Burton states that 11 of the 1344 Victoria Crosses awarded since its inception over 100 years earlier, were earned at Rorke's Drift.

THE DVD & SPECIAL FEATURES: FRONT ROW ENTERTAINMENT - WIDESCREEN EDITION

An outdoor epic like Zulu benefits from being Widescreen, which this DVD is. The sound and video transfer are quite good, and a big improvement over the VHS edition. If you can, be sure to select the Widescreen edition which highlights the huge outdoor, on-location panoramic scenery that in full-screen mode seems reduced into the background, and with the reduction goes also some of the scale, and scenic grandeur of the natural settings. Special Features are absent, but this edition is remastered.

 >- 5-STAR CLASSIC WAR EPIC

'Zulu' is a rapidly paced, fictionalized account of the historic incident in Rorke's Drift in Natalaccount in 1879. Suspense, action and the unknown fills this film from beginning to end. The big question boils down to, will anyone survive the night? I have seen this film countless times since its release 42 years ago and I have found it gripping and exciting each and every time.",1160265600,5,3829,5.120772946859903

362866,5,6301767918,One of the best action movies I've seen.  Michael Caine's first role I believe and he is great as an engineer in the British army who is by default pressed into service to lead his men in defending a British outpost in Zulu country. The battle scene at the end of the movie should be the template for all battle scenes and Jack Hawkins boozy performance is top notch.  Highly recommended.,1153353600,3,388,4.450704225352113
362867,5,6301767918,"Zulu is arguably one of the best movies ever made. Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are the main stars in this true story. The main reason why I liked the film is because of the battle scenes. Furthermore, the character development was excellent and the acting by Caine, Baker as well as the extras playing as Zulu warriors were superb. In short, if you like war movies, this is a MUST buy but if you prefer romantic ones, stay clear of this.

362868,5,6301767918,"Zulu is a great old action movie.  It's great for a lot of reasons, but it's definitely a 40 year old movie.  It was made in a simpler time for Hollywood, back when a movie could be made to provide viewers with a good time without any real political agenda.  This is the kind of film you can sit back and enjoy while still appreciating the work that went into this film.

Michael Caine does a nice job in this film, and I think it was his first major film.  However, he doesn't play a John Wayne type of role, he's just a guy who does his part and gets the job done.  The other actors basically do the same thing; all do it very well.

There is no love story at all and the friendships are never really developed.  The commander of the British forces isn't very likeable, and Michael Caine's charisma is held in check for the most part.  Still, you get lots of action in an unusual setting.  For example, we've all seen 100 films of each of the following scenarios: WWII, knights & castles, submarines, cowboys and indians, etc.; but how many movies have we seen with this setting?  To top it off, this is based on a true event.  And from a book I read on this battle, the film is reasonably accurate.

Don't expect modern special affects.  You will see guys shot at close range and fall dead without 1 drop of blood anywhere.  Still, the action is very good.  This is definitely a ""guy's film"".",1145836800,6,1395,4.267175572519084

Be that as it may,I loved it! When Lt. Chard orders the pitiful remainder of troops to form 2 lines for the next attack of the Zulus,I was ""blown away"" how they orchestrated firing,then kneeling to reload,while the line behind advanced and fired,and they kept repeating this manuever. It was AWESOME to watch. I have been enjoying purchasing and watching the older war films,as it is such a joy to watch such well-made films,with fabulous actors and without the filthy language of the war films since the Vietnam era. Even my late husband (a Vietnam Vet,BTW) could not stand the movies about and since that war for the language/gore Hollywood wallows in.

I have one thing against the desription on the DVD case where it says  ""As a terrifying war chant echoes across the majestic African plains,4,000 Zulu tribesmen rise up from the tall grass that hides them.""  This never happens! They are never hidden in tall grass,and in fact there is no tall grass around!  When I read that,I thought it surely was the film I remembered from my childhood,because I seem to remember such a scene,but it is not in this movie! So unless this movie is dratistically different on DVD than the one I recall,I am thinking of a different movie,but that does not explain a description for a scene that is not included?

In reality both were relatively old for their respective ranks and it could be considered that they had both been overlooked and left behind at Rourke's Drift by the Main Briish force as it was considered an unimportant position. However both were professionally trained and this together with the profesionalism of the other soldiers is what allowed them to succesfully defeat 4000 zulus.

Who doesn't like routing for the underdog and coming out on top? However, this film does less for this `epic episode' in its two hours than the shining reviews found on this website. The opening scene is by far the most interesting as the Zulus prepare for a mass wedding. Dancing and singing cuts back and forth to a British father/daughter duo who are in South Africa to preach the word. They figure out that a Zulu army is headed for a British military post and they run off to warn them. From there the story unwinds painfully slow as the Red Coats demonstrate their pomp and lack of sincerity. The stilted dialogue and lousy fight scenes (when the Zulu's finally arrive)  do prove entertaining, but not how they were intended to, I'm sure.

At Rorkes Drift, the defense was by disciplined British infantry, and the defensive position was laid out by a military engineer who knew what he was doing in fortifying the site.  Discipline and good planning ensured success.

There are a number of films about historic, last stand, defenses including ""Khartoum"" and ""The Alamo,"" where defenses failed and the defenders were massacred; and ""55 Days at Peking"" and ""Zulu,"" where the defenses were successful.  Perhaps there is a message in this, i.e., succeed or die.  If failure is equated with death, there is a high incentive to do your utmost.  These were ""take no prisoners"" type situations.  There were no non-combatants.

I remember someone asking once about the significance of officers commissioning dates.  In this case it made a great deal of difference and resulted in the engineer officer having overall command.  He obviously had better training in designing and building defensive works, even ones that used walls, fences, wagons, and sandbags (or grain bags).  The final redoubt was a do-or-die last line of defense.

It is crystal clear and wide, wide screen best viewed on a wide-screen monitor. As for the film, it was certainly one of my favorites as a youngster when it first came out, and I still need to see it at least once a year, but it does have the pace of an older film with a bit too many histrionics to stand up well today(as if the sergeant and his men would have the time to stand around spouting verses with the Zulu hordes just over the horizon). But that said, visually it's a sumptuous film. If you've never seen it, it is well worth a visit. If you've seen it before, it's a great transfer and you can always fast-forward through the over-dramatic bits (""The Lord sayeth you shalt not kill...!). I think my favorite line is by the above-mentioned sergeant while reading off the company roster: ""Say 'Sir'... officer on parade.)",1128988800,17,1296,4.426778242677824
363033,5,6301767918,"""Zulu"" is an epic action film with thousands of Zulu warriors running across large fields to attack those nice straight lines of outnumbered red coated British soldiers. This is not men trying to buy time as in ""The Alamo"" and ""The 300 Spartans"" or trying to hold a strategic position as in ""The Bridge at Remagen"" or ""A Bridge Too Far."" I n ""Zulu"" these British regulars are troops in the wrong place at the wrong time, fighting neither for Queen nor country but simply to save their lives. If in doing so they do their duty, then that is just a bonus as long as they are still alive at the battle's end.

If ""Zulu Dawn"" is about the arrogance of the British military in assuming that native troops could never stand up against the ""modern"" military might of the British empire, than ""Zulu"" is about the simple nobility of its common soldiers.  There is not a finer depiction of the British regulars in their resplendent redcoats in all of cinema.  There are over 100 men from the South Wales Borderers 24th Regiment Of Foot at Rourkes Drift, a third of them wounded, under the command of Lt. John Chard (Stanley Baker) of the Royal Engineers, in charge only because he has seniority. Chard came here to build a bridge. On the other side there are 4,000 Zulu warriors who missed out on the glorious victory earlier in the day at Islandwana and see Rourkes Drift as a chance to make amends.  The action at Rorke's Drift was fought Wednesday 22- Thursday 23 January, 1879, as tjese soldiers defended the supply station, aided by the Martini-Henry rifle ""with some guts behind it.""

This is also Michael Caine's first film and it pretty much shows except when his dandified character is caught up in the actual battles. However, this is more than balanced by Richard Burton's solemn opening and closing narrations and the impressive collection of supporting players, particularly Nigel Green as the unforgettable Colour Sergeant Fred Bourne, Patrick Magee as Surgeon Maj. James Henry Reynolds and the taciturn Dickie Owen as Cpl. Frederic Schiess, NNC.  Among the regular troops James Booth is given the most to do as Pvt. Henry Hook, but Glynn Edwards as Cpl. William Allen, David Kernan as Pvt. Fred Hitch, and Peter Gill as Pvt. John (612) Williams deserve to be commended as well.  Between the landscape and the cast, director Cy Endfield (""Mysterious Island"") has most of his work done for him before the cameras start to roll.

In addition to John Barry's memorable and stirring score, ""Zulu"" has a very interesting use of music in the film's best sequence. As the Zulu warriors begin singing before their charge, the Welshmen start singing a stirring version of ""Men of Harlech"" while manning the barricades. The counterpoint between the two songs, the two cultures, and the two sides, is quite stirring, especially as the singing continues once the charge has begun. I never miss an opportunity to watch that particular scene, especially now that I have the lyrics and can sing along (be aware that the lyrics are not the traditional ones to the song and appear to be have been written especially for the film).",1126915200,2,3117,4.748613678373383

363035,5,6301767918,"Bursting with action, ""Zulu"" can easily be considered a fine war film.  Personally, I feel it is one of the best of its kind.

  Set against beautiful Africa vistas, ""Zulu"" guides the audience through a small British garrison that's in the process of being beseiged by thousands of bloodthirsty Zulu warriors.  However, the Brits don't budge an inch, for they are well-disciplined.  The Zulus respond with constant attacks(in the form of wonderfully-filmed action sequences), hoping to break the spirit of their enemy.  What follows is an exciting look into events with historical significance.

  This was, I believe, Michael Caine's first film, and he does well as Lieutenant Bromhead.  Stanley Baker, who produced and acted, is equally good as his superior officer.

This film also manages to convey not only the tedium, the endless waiting and the buildup of fear the soldiers must experience while waiting for the eventual confrontation, but it also humanizes the enemy.  It shows you the enormous differences between the two cultures, yet manages to portray both groups of soldiers as people, respecting each others abilities.  I have read a few reviews by some stating there are a few inaccuracies with some of the characters, which is an unfortunate disservice to the audience.  I will confess the my knowledge of the exact events at Rorke's Drift is limited so I can't nitpick at its shortcomings, but the intensity of this movie is just unsurpassed, that I have to give it 5 stars.

 The Zulu warriors were magnificent, frightening, human and so utterly in contrast to the British, that you couldn't fail to question the relevance of these two peoples needing to confront in the first place.  The anticipation of the coming battle kept me on the edge of my seat like no other movie has been able to do (amazing considering there was about an hours worth of daily military life, and updates on the advancing army).  I think this is far superior to any of the newer war films in that it deals with real fear: the emotional tensions and the sheer ugliness, yet courage and duty in the face of all these things (not to mention the pointlessness and the lives destroyed).

 The shinning moment in these events, as portrayed in the movie, is the Zulu chanting.  To find such beauty in the midst of the battle is beyond comprehension.  I'm sure it would be near impossible to duplicate in today's films, but I am grateful to the makers of this film to show us this part of Zulu culture.

The true story has it that the commanding officers Bromehead and Chard were not actually in command, one of the inferiors took over but that's not the point. The fact is that this is a brilliantly cast film with a dialogue that beats the hell  out of all the Hollywood films made today.

363095,5,6301767918,"When I saw this I was completely surprised by how well done this was, considering it is about 40 years old. What I noticed was that at times the British soldiers were the ones who had to retreat several feet in their battles with the Zulu warriors, unlike other movies we see where the African natives are the ones who are usually being mistreated and beaten by white explorers.

But don't take this as a race vs. race type thing, this is just about 100 soldiers fighting to survive against 4,000 Zulu warriors, and the ironic thing is that the soldiers were only sent to build a bridge near their fort.

The movie stars great actors like Stanley Baker, and Michale Caine, who some of you should know or at least heard of. I think this was one of his first major roles in a movie.

The movie takes place in Africa, and the British soldiers were sent to just build a bridge [actually they were engineers, the soldiers were already at the fort] Meanwhile they are soon going to figure out that an army of Zulu warriors have declared war on any white person they see after a battle with 1000 British soldiers a few days earlier.

The fort is where the movie takes place, the men turn over wagons, and prop up sandbags to make walls to defend the open spaces between their buildings. Any man that can walk and carry a rifle is ordered to fight, even if they are injured. The main rule is that if you have an arm, you need a gun and you need to fight.

Now as far as the fight scenes, some people might find them too violent, but believe me, if you've seen the Passion of the Christ, or even Saving Private Ryan, this is nothing. I'm not the type who likes to see guys kill each other, bullets and spears flying everywhere, but I will admit that they were exciting to see.

There are a few surprises in here as well, including the Zulus getting their hands on rifles off of dead soldiers, and when a stampede of cows stops another Zulu attack in its tracks.

The scenery is great, especially when the army of Zulu appear at the top of the edge of the hills, very breathtaking if you really look at it.

This is a great movie, and if you haven't seen the ending I won't ruin it, but believe me, both sides went through hell to try and stop the other. I would totally reccommend this to anyone who likes action, suspense, or is even a fan of Michale Caine, who gives a great performance I might add!",1098489600,9,2392,4.2765486725663715
363096,5,6301767918,"""Zulu"" is  a movie about one of the many far-flung battles that took place in the British Empire during the 19th Century.  In this case the battle was in the south African country of Natal in the 1870's.  A small outpost of British soldiers find themselves in the path of an army of native African warriors.  The numbers are overwhelming in favor of the natives but the armaments favor the British soldiers.  The battle scenes and the essence of sacrifice and bravery in the face of such odds are the strength of the movie.

The movie starts out a bit slow and there are characters involved that are of limited importance to the overall focus of the movie.  However, once the issue is clear, the film moves along at a steady clip.  In the prelude to battle and in the pauses in between fighting, a certain amount of character development takes place.  The writers seem to have set up one Private Hook for a good deal of their attention.  I guess this was to help us see the common cause to battle among British soldiers in even the shirkers in their midst.  The acting is of a generally excellent quality.  I especially liked the sergeant major whose name slips me.  This is either the acting debut of Michael Caine or close thereafter.  Both his talent and inexperience can be appreciated in ""Zulu"".

The native warriors are generally pictured as a mass of humanity which might bother some viewers.  However, I suspect further development along this line would have detracted from the pace of the movie.  This is the era of British Colonialism and the movie makes no serious attempt to discuss this phenomenon.  That would likewise have detracted from the impact of the movie.  I felt that the warriors were dealt with in a respectable manner but it was the over-matched British who were the subject of the film and this perspective was never lost.

This is a movie that I enjoy seeing over and over whenever I can.  It appeals to the emotions in a postive way so long as courage, stamina and determination are seen as positive traits.",1098057600,5,2036,4.6

Just from a cinematic experience alone one should watch this film. Some people might be squeamish about the death and carnage, but it is a fascinating slice of human drama.

Together,they'll show those incompetent Brits a thing or two about real fighting and the the true meaning of loyalty while Timothy Spall will be excellent as the likable but bumbling Brit Bromhead... oh hang on, that was ""The Last Samurai"" wasn't it. OK, enough nonsense.

""Zulu"" may well be the greatest war film ever made. Apart from the shear exhileration of the battle sequences which are at times almost unbearably tense without having to resort to lots of blood, what stands out for me is the screenplay itself. It's flawless and there is simply not a single dull moment. The script is just brilliant. I just love the scene when the malingering Pte Hook is told by Surgeon Reynolds that ""Brandy's for heroes"" only to be seen taking a swig from a bottle in defiance after proving himself in battle later in the film. It's scenes like these of which there are many which make this such a memorable film.

Sure, the film has taken a few liberties with the facts such as the singing of ""men of Harlech"" towards the end (they would probably have been too dog tired and thirsty to do anything but grunt) but essentially it sticks to history. I've read many articles and books on the subject and I still maintain that it is a hell of a lot more accurate than just about any other called ""historical"" films made in Hollywood over the last few years.",1097107200,2,1697,4.578947368421052

Everything about it is first rate and it is very easy to utter the trite saying "" they don't make movies like this anymore"" after having seen it. The film basically follows the events leading up to and concerning the attack on a small British detachment in late 1870's Africa by Zulu tribesman. The scale is GRAND and you will marvel at the on location scenery, great rousing score by John Barry, the brilliantly staged combat scenes and the excellent acting by Stanley Baker, Michael Caine, Nigel Greene, James Booth and the fine supporting cast. The pacing of the film is very well done, slowly increasing the tension of the troops as the Zulu warriors draw near.  The characters are "" fleshed out"" well and the viewer learns a lot about them to the point that there is a sense of loss when some do not survive. There is a brilliant "" cliffhanger edit"" where one character comes VERY close to death and there are many moving moments that bring a lump to ones' throat, particularly a private dialouge between the 2 officers ( Stanley Baker and Michael Caine) towards the end that is shattering.  What makes this film so amazing is to realize that the events depicted actually happened: the courage and tenacity displayed by the British must have been virtually superhuman just for them to stay alive. In summary, Zulu is an excellent drama/action-adventure film that will appeal to a wide age group due to its sticking to the basics: it tells a great story in a very professional great way. It is without doubt one of the 60's greatest films and arguably one of the best dramas ever made. I recently had the privledge to view a 35 mm print of Zulu on the big screen and as expected, it was AMAZING. If you get a chance to do the same, don't pass it up!

Although the film style and acting is somewhat antiquated, the film's great scenes along with its faithful represenation of 19th century british military life and Zulu culture more than makes up for its other shortcomings.

  Michael Caine is in his first feature film as Lt. Bromhead, a mild-mannered aristocrat whose laissez-faire command approach comes into conflict with the views of Lt. Chard (Stanley Baker), the military engineer who outranks him in seniority by only a few months. Having heard of the nearby Zulu massacre of 1200 British troops at Iswandhlwana, Bromhead and Chard try to set their differences aside for the sake of defending the delapidated mission outpost from the certain onslaught to come. Their leadership is further compromised by the mission's owner and missionary (Jack Hawkins) whose predictions of doom and divine vengeance threaten the morale of the garrison. Inevitably, the Zulu leader, Cetewayo, arrives with his 4000 proud warriors who expect to make quick work of the small and vulnerable garrison. Onslaught after onslaught, hordes of Zulu warriors bravely charge against the British but are repelled each time with horrific causalties. Fighting barely 100 well armed and trained men, the Zulus lost over 1500 warriors.

  Again, some of the dialogue and film styles are rather dated but the plot moves at a steady pace. The actors are top knotch and the action is great. This film is very faithful to the customs of the time and portrays the brave Zulu warriors with the respect they deserve.

This makes Zulu an original and different movie.  However, the quality of the acting is generally low, although Michael Caine delivers a splendid performance.  The script, direction and special effects are also deficient.  Zulu was made on a low budget and it shows.

363164,5,6301767918,"I've watched this film a couple of times and am always impressed.  It is based on the factual story of the 1879 decimation of the 24th Foot Regiment of Welsh infantry at the battle of Rourke's Drift, a small station in Natal, Africa, during the Zulu war.  More Victoria's Crosses (the British version of our Congressional Medal of Honor) were awarded as a result of that action than during any other battle.

Michael Caine made his debut in the film, and Stanley Baker also does a great job as the engineer in command of the operation.  Caine portrayed a diffident young lieutenant of infantry, a  product of generations of soldiers.  Baker's part was that of a lieutenant of engineers, there to build a bridge,  who was slightly (months) senior to Caine, and thus assumed command of the troop during the action.

After a great victory against a British army of over 1,300, the small supply station at Rourke's Drift is attacked by the Zulu nation, and successfuly defended by less than 100 men over a couple day period, after which the Zulus withdrew, having suffered terrible casualties.

One gets the impression that this is the British military as it might have been portrayed by Rudyard Kipling at his best.  A thoroughly riveting movie.  One of the best I've seen.

It is riviting to watch because it is almost too much to beleive as you watch the battle at Rorke's Drift unfold.  They say that sometimes true history is more exciting than fiction.  In the case of the stand by the British against the Zulus, it most assuredly true.
  I am a history instructor and I have written several papers and delivered numerous oral presentations regarding this historical battle.  Producer and star Stanley Baker has done his homework on this subject.  The two hours you will devote to this epic tale will thrill and amaze you.  Why? Because it is almost exactly depicted as it really happened in 1879.
  In a period of about 30 hours on the 23rd and 24th of January 1879, 142 British soldiers held off over 4000 Zulu warriors in a battle for survival than will live forever in the annals of history.  These few British soldiers killed or wounded approximately 2000 Zulus while losing only 17 of their own.  There were eleven Victoria Crosses and three Distiguished Service Crosses awarded for this action.

363169,5,6301767918,"Let me preface this review by noting that this refers to the movie itself, not the quality of the DVD/its special features or lack thereof.
The movie begins by showing the aftermath of a battle between Zulu tribesman and the British Army on the slopes of Isandwhana in the Natal province of what is now the Republic of South Africa, 1879.  As Richard Burton narrates: the British were massacred by an overwhelming force of Zulu warriors in a trained and highly disciplined attack.  The remnant of the British have retreated to a mission, while the Zulus prepare another assault.
There are less than 100 British soldiers fit for duty, and 4000 Zulu.  Moreover, some of the Zulus took firearms off the dead bodies of the British soldiers from the original battle to complement their sheilds and spears.  Lt. Chard (Stanley Baker) an officer of engineers, overrides Lt. Bromhead (Michael Caine) due to less than half a year of seniorirty and comandeers the defense of the mission-turned-fort.
This is a truly great movie.  While not flawless (it suffers from the historical errors commonplace to historical movies) it a superlative action/adventure movie, but is meritorious for one further, perhaps most important reason: It is almost entirely devoid of rasicm.  This may not seem like much today, but in 1964 it was commonplace to portray the enemy, be they blacks, native americans, or Germans as mindless savages.  Zulu, on the other hand,  portrays the African Warriors as intelligent fighters and noble warriors, and the only person to make a somewhat racist comment is quickly shot down.
Even if you're not a history buff like myself, please do yourself a favor and watch this movie.",1069027200,8,1687,4.9786476868327405
363170,5,6301767918,"Zulu is one of the finest historical dramas and war films ever made. With excellent performances by Stanley Baker, Nigel Greene, Jack Hawkins and (at the time) newcomer Michael Caine, you feel the anquish, fear, desperation and exhiliration of men thrust into the brutality of a hopeless situation yet emerging triumphant. The costumes and weapons for both the British and Zulu warriors are stunning and accurate and both sides are portrayed in very human terms. The locations are also quite authentic. The John Barry soundtrack, written before his later awesome soundtracks for the early James Bond pictures, is terrific and will carry you along, both up and down, with the action in the film. Richard Burton does the brief narration at the beginning and end. There are many exciting and dramatic scenes recounting true events from the battle of Rourke's Drift. The scene where the Zulus sing their battle song and the British respond by singing ""Men of Harlech"" as a sign of their own courage sounds stunning and is filled with real tension.

363251,5,6301767918,"This movie is a familiar classic and the historical (and miraculous) event upon which it is based is even more well-known.  Therefore, I will go straight to talking about this DVD's technical merits.  Compared to VHS and earlier DVD versions, this MGM release delivers great video quality.  The image is sharp, the colours solid, and great adjustments in brightness and contrast.  Not all of MGM's war classics in DVD are so well done, but I was very glad that this one, ZULU, was.  There's a fairly long trailer and a very good scene selection menu.  Of course, there is no fancy Dolby 5.1 sound or other redundant ""extras"" found in DVD versions of more contemporary (and easily forgettable) movies.  My only disappointment with this MGM release is the sub-titles.  If there are a lot of words to appear, some of them may appear above the bottom black bar and into the lower portion of the movie image.  Because of this, I turned on my TV's closed captioning option and learned that this DVD does contain closed captioning for the hearing-impaired, with all the captioning staying at the bottom black bar.  ZULU has become even greater in this MGM DVD incarnation.  A must for every war/history buff who finds nothing politically offensive about watching throngs of spear-wielding Zulu warriors being gunned down by a comparatively handful of British soldiers.",1065657600,3,1361,4.925438596491228
363252,5,6301767918,"Watch Zulu enough and you'll see the warrior stab the wall instead of the Welshman; you'l see one man defend the perimeter from about 60 Zulus on the other side of some mealy bags (the Zulu actors seem to be just milling around). However, these things aside, for a 1964 production, this is an epic effort.
Firstly, the producers chose to film on location the in Kwa-Zulu Natal area of South Africa, near to where the actual battle happened. This beats many movies of the current era who think driving a few miles in to the hills of Southern California will do for almost any 'on-location' shoot.
We have the rookie-in-charge Bromhead, played by Michael Caine in his first movie, Stanley Baker as the Officer of Engineers, both firmly supported by such greats as Jack Hawkins, James Booth and Nigel Green (who was surely born to play the tough-but-fair colour-seargent).
Based on a true story, Zulu recounts the before, during and aftermath of a 4000-strong Zulu assualt on a small garrison of just over 100 British & native soldiers. The Zulus, armed now with the Britis soldiers' dead comrades Martini-Henry rifles, pour from the hills and attempt to overrun the makeshift corral at Rourke's Drift. It's up to the Brits (mostly Welsh to be specific) to fend them off.
Richard Burton also lends his voice to the narration, giving a sombre yet regal sound to both ends of the movie. A great battle movie, great soundtrack with the Welsh privates singing Men of Harlech liable to get your hair standing on end.",1063843200,3,1508,4.759541984732825
363253,4,6301767918,"This is a very fine action film that is based on a real battle in January of 1879.  The names of many of the characters are real because eleven of the soldiers won a Victoria Cross and many more won other decorations.  150 soldiers defended a supply station against something like 4,000 Zulu warriors for two days.  And these 150 aren't the ""real"" soldiers - they were left as bridge builders and quartermasters and such.  The fighters had gone out and gotten largely slaughtered by another army of Zulu.
The story as told here is full of vivid characters.  Of course, the real life characters were almost completely different than their portrayal here.  For example, the battle didn't break off because the Zulus wanted to honor the brave English, but because they saw off to their flank that reinforcements were coming.  But it is true enough for a movie.  Just don't take everything here as gospel (as you should avoid doing on anything from Hollywood and almost everything on film).
Michael Caine is glorious as Gonville Bromhead who was second in command and from a well-known military family.  Stanley Baker is very fine as the engineer who finds himself in command of a military operation.  There are many other fine and memorable performances, but my favorite is Nigel Green as Colour Sgt Frank Bourne.  In any fight it is the Sergeants that keep everything together and the discipline necessary to continue the fighting.  This is a wonderful portrayal.
It is a movie that could not be made today, but I am glad that we have it on DVD.  I wish we had it in a better transfer with some more background material, but this is certainly worth having.  Maybe we can get a restored version someday in the future.",1062288000,7,1714,4.688963210702341
363254,4,6301767918,"This 1964 film is based on a real incident in 1879.  It's set in Africa where the Zulus have just massacred 1500 British troops.  Word spreads to a different small British outpost that the Zulus are about to attack the 140 men there, many of whom are sick.  After a day of ferocious fighting, they have pushed the Zulus back.  The Brits have guns, of course.  But so do some of  the Zulus because they have taken guns off fallen British troops in their first attack.
Stanley Baker and Michael Caine are cast as British lieutenants who disagree on tactics.  Jack Hawkins is cast as a pacifist preacher.  There is a lot of bickering among the men, some of which provides comic relief.  There's fear here too as most of them assume they will die.  It is all filmed from the British point of view.  No mention is made about why the Zulus want to attack the English.  And no history is explained other than the fact that the Zulus are intent on a massacre.  Clearly, this film was made well before anyone thought about political correctness.
The battle scenes were impressive but yet boring.  Hundreds of ferocious Zulu warriors just keep attacking and there is no individualization or background attached to any of them.  The Brits die too and the bodies pile up.  But as the film was made in 1964, all the deaths are clean.  The actors just clutch their chests and fall down.
The acting is uniformly good.  There is real drama in the plot.  And the African landscape is well filmed.  But the film just doesn't translate into more than a paean to the bravery of the British soldiers who managed to hold off the savage Zulus.  It is interesting to see the changes that have occurred in filmmaking over the past forty years. So film buffs might enjoy it.  But for everyone else, ""Zulu"" has just not stood the test of time.",1057449600,2,1816,4.489296636085627
363255,5,6301767918,"I well recall the first time I saw this film. It was during the summer of 1964. My family and I were vacationing with another family, sharing a rental house on the New England shore. Zulu was the only film available to see at the village theatre. My friend and I could not convince our wives to join us so we went alone. (The title deterred them.) After the deliberately slow introduction of setting, circumstances, and characters, director Cy Raker Endfield begins to accelerate the plot developments and soon our emotions became wholly engaged in the subsequent action. Later, the more we raved about Zulu, the more reassured our wives became that they had not missed anything special. They still think that and I could not disagree more.

The film recreates an especially important segment of British military history: the siege of the Rorke's Drift outpost in Natal, South Africa, in January of 1879, when a company of 120 soldiers (29 Welsh, 50 English and the rest made up of Scots, Irish and other nationalities) defended the outpost against more than 4,000 Zulu warriors. Their commanding officer (a lieutenant played by Stanley Baker who also produced the film) and one other officer (played by Michael Caine) had no prior combat experience. Fortunately, they are supported by Color Sergeant Bourne (masterfully portrayed by Nigel Green) as they and their comrades beat back one ferocious attack after another. The carnage is substantial and graphic but never gratuitous. As some indication of the defenders' courage, the viewer later learns that from 1856 until 1964 when the film was made, only 1,344 Victoria Crosses had been awarded...eleven to men in the Rorke's Drift contingent. (Of special note is the fact that the voice-over narration which includes this information is provided by Richard Burton.) Aside from the combat itself, the film offers so much else. For example, the relationship between the two officers which proceeds from initial discomfort to mutual respect. Also the sub plot involving the Reverend Otto Witt (Jack Hawkins) and his daughter Margareta (Ulla Jacobsson) who are allowed to depart a Zulu camp in peace, arriving at Rorke's Drift before the Zulus do. Witt tries but fails to convince Lt. John Chard (Baker) to avoid a military confrontation. Finally, special credit must be given to James Booth for his indelible portrayal of Private Henry Hook, a malcontent and malingerer who (in the crucible of ferocious hand-to-hand combat) becomes transformed into a reluctant but admirable hero, one of the eleven Victoria Cross recipients.

As my friend and I departed the village theatre almost 40 years ago, we said nothing to each other. Only later, in response to our wives' inquiries, did we express our reactions to what we had experienced, albeit vicariously. Then and now, we agree, although the film celebrates courage among both the Welsh troops and their Zulu adversaries, it does not celebrate the circumstances at Rorke's Drift which require it. Endfield and Baker leave no doubt about this point at the film's conclusion. Nor do I wish to when completing this brief commentary.",1056585600,8,3127,5.093567251461988
363256,1,6301767918,"First off let me say that I absolutely LOVE ""Zulu"" however I was greatly disappointed with the latest DVD version.
First of all there was no insert with the case.  Would it have killed MGM to provide some additional background information on the film?
Second, and most importantly, the sound quality is PATHETIC.
This DVD is presented in Mono and the whole thing sounds as if you are trying to listen to it underwater.
A truly shabby treatment of a great film.  MGM should be ashamed.
Personally I suggest sticking to the VHS version until a better DVD becomes available.

363257,4,6301767918,"It obviously doesn't take much effort to write a movie review here.  The reviewer of ""Zulu"" on June 8th proves my point.
She entitles her piece ""Not very realistic."" She goes on to say ""I expected to see some kind of standoff and battle that might have taken place in the real world. Instead, I was treated to a spectacle that had no relation to reality."" After making a comment like that, you'd expect to hear why the movie has no bearing to the real world.  We'd then be treated to a point by point refutation of where ""Zulu"" erred, backed by the author's foray into historical research.
Instead of this however, we are treated to inanities like: ""The whole premise of this movie was absurd. The British contingent was on a mission to build a bridge across a ""stream"" the flow of which was no wider than if you drained your bathtub. My first question was, ""Why are they building a bridge there?"" No sane person would build a bridge there. You don't need a bridge to cross a trickle of water you could walk across without getting your shoes wet.""
The river in question is the Buffalo River, dear.  It formed the border between Natal and Zululand. While the river as shown may have been a ""trickle"" at the time, rivers DO flood. Ah, well.  A little mistake, you say.  But wait, there's more...
""Then, the Brit commander was totally dense. Everyone was telling him to pack up and pull back; but no, he had to make a stand. Against all odds. What was the principle involved? Sheer stupidity. Anyone with half a brain could see there was no value in making a stand. Is there value in watching a half wit do something that any sane person would reject outright? That's what this movie is all about. Watching some dense military commander risk the lives of his troops for no good reason. You want to jump out of your seat, grab him by the throat, and ask him why he's being such a dumba--. In Viet Nam, he would have been fragged by his own troops for pulling a stunt like that.""
Here, in delivering her opinion of standing fast versus retreating, the reviewer shows her total absence of military skill. The commander of the garrison at Rorke's Drift had about 140 men total; 105 effectives and 35 sick men.  Even if they loaded the wounded into wagons and marched off smartly at the first inkling of trouble, they wouldn't have gotten far.  The rate of wagon movement was about that of the normal British march rate: c. 2 1/2 miles per hour or 12-15 miles/day.  Contrast that with the normal Zulu movement rates (circa 5 mph or 40 miles per day), and its easy to see that the Zulus would have quickly caught the fleeing column and massacred them.
So perjoratively accusing dead heroes like Chard and Bromhead leaders of the garrison) of being ""stupid"" and 'insane' is not only unkind, it's downright foolish.  In this case having ""half a brain"" might be better than having a whole, unused one.
'Standing fast' behind fortifications (however makeshift) where the barriers offered protection from shot and spear was the only prudent thing to do. It ultimately saved the small garrison, and allowed them to hold over about 40 times their number.  In real life this course of action was recommended to the commander by Commisary Dalton, a veteran retired NCO who quickly recognized the 'sanity"" behind digging in. For the key role he played at the battle in offering this advice and for other actions, Dalton was later specially recognized by the Crown. (Alas, in the movie he was reduced to a somewhat weak characterization.)
Are there historical inaccuracies with ""Zulu?""
Yep, plenty.  There's no evidence the British troops sang, for example. Some of the tactics are flawed.  There was no cattle stampede. But what movie has ever been made that's been totally realistic?
Is Zulu a great war movie?  Yes, it is. Can information on the battle at Rorke's Drift be easily researched on the internet? Yes, as this rebuttal review proves.
Is Lauren a seemingly lazy, self-absorbed reviewer who fails to properly research a topic before offering her staggeringly ignorant opinion?

Think about the old silent films of the '30's where wave after wave of Indians would attack the small wagon train and 10,000 Indians would be repelled by a contingent of 50 or 60 settlers. That's Zulu, only set in Africa. By my count, the thousands of Zulus killed 250 to 300 Brits, even though the whole Brit contingent comprised roughly 60 to 70 soldiers. Amazingly, after suffering significant losses, the Brit contingent seemed to increase in size. Time and time again, half the British contingent would be wiped out in a Zulu surge. But afterward, in looking at the number of Brit soldiers still alive, there was no noticeable loss of soldiers.
The whole premise of this movie was absurd. The British contingent was on a mission to build a bridge across a ""stream"" the flow of which was no wider than if you drained your bathtub. My first question was, ""Why are they building a bridge there?"" No sane person would build a bridge there.

This project was a labour of love for producer/actor Stanley Baker, and the result is an unforgettable depiction of one of the most famous battles in African history.
The credits say ""introducing Michael Caine"". This was not really his first film, but it was certainly his first major role, and he made the most of it. You do witness the birth of a major star, who is still turning in terrific performances to this day.
At the same time--and notwithstanding the picture on the DVD cover--it is Stanley Baker who has the lead role, and he is very fine indeed. His character is a vulnerable man, forced to command in an impossible situation. Stanley Baker succumbed to cancer some years ago--he was knighted by the Queen just before he passed away. Whether playing a villain, or in the case of ""Zulu"", the hero, he was a real professsional. He was also a proud Welshman, and I'm sure that the role of brave Welsh soldiers who fought at Rourke's Drift, was an aspect of the plot that he was pleased to emphasize.
Acting kudos also go to James Booth, as an unethical coward, Jack Hawkins as a fanatical and alcoholic clergyman, and Nigel Green as a sergeant no soldier would want to annoy !
The DVD is beautiful--the colours are clear and vivid--with all those red tunics, you don't want colour that is pale or washed out. This is also a film that absolutely has to be seen in widescreen, and this DVD captures the battle scenes and the gorgeous African panorama beautifully. It does indeed have a ""cast of thousands""--no digital tricks here--just real people. I must agree with another reviewer on the sound--only mono ? Why ? Some extras would have been nice--there is not even a booklet inside the case. On the other hand, the price is right.

363315,4,6301767918,"In 1879 a British column was nearly annihiliated by a large ""impi"" of Zulu warriors near Isandhlwana.  Afterward, a small British force encamped at nearby Rorke's Drift (a trading station and mission) consisting of 104 fit soldiers and a number of invalids in a makeshift hospital became the next target.  For two days the station was attacked by waves of Zulu warriors.  The total number of attackers was about 4500.  In the end, nearly 400 Zulus were killed in comparison with only about 20 of the defenders, the hospital was burned to the ground, and 11 Victoria Crosses were awarded to the survivors.
The movie itself is a reasonably faithful re-creation of the events at Rorke's Drift, with good acting by Michael Caine, Stanley Baker, and a large supporting cast of Zulus.  The ferocity of the assault, the stubborn, desperate defence by the small garrison, and the chaos of hand-to-hand combat at the barricades can all be felt through the cinematography.  One wonderful aspect of this film is that the battle scenes were shot using huge numbers of actors in the role of Zulu warriors, who were obviously able to re-create the tactics and movement of the real army of 1879.  Their war cries, synchronised clashing spear-on-shield movements, and in-formation advancement create the sense of a real army moving to attack the apparently doomed garrison.  This is one of very few films that gives the viewer a sense of what combat must have been like in the days before mechanised armies appeared on the scene.",1050796800,8,1513,4.905882352941177
363316,4,6301767918,"I love this movie. A young, sexy beast Michael Caine in full droll mode, and beautiful brave Zulus. I think that's the remarkable thing about this film, both the British (technically it's a Welsh Division) and the Zulus come off as being outstandingly brave. And considering this film was made during the height of Apartheid in South Africa, I'm surprised the producers got away with such a favorable view of the Zulu people. The scenery is stunning, glorious locations. And the Zulu people themselves, their remarkable culture... if the scene where the Zulu warriors stop and sing in front of the Brits doesn't move you (talk about shock & awe!), something is wrong with you.
The acting is better than average. Michael Caine, arguably the greatest living actor now, is superb in one of his earliest outings. And Oh My is he wonderful to look at. Stanley Baker is also excellent, as is most of the ensemble cast. Nigel Green as the salt of the earth Sgt. keeping the men on their toes is a stand out.
Certainly there are moments of cheese, but they're few and far between. This is a very good war picture that sweeps you up and makes you care about the Brits (even though they had no business in Africa) and the fate of this tiny garrison. And it's based on real events, which makes the bravery displayed even more moving.",1050710400,14,1322,4.6059322033898304
363317,5,6301767918,"This has remained over the years one of my favorite guilty pleasures.  The plot is exquisitely simple:  a small contingent of British soldiers in 1879 in Natal, South Africa withhold a ferocious attack by thousands of Zulu warriors.  The film is an adrenaline rush from beginning to end.
Several things make this film an enduring classic of the genre.  First, the magnificent location for the filming.  I haven't been able to verify that the film was shot on the precise location of the battle of Rorke's Drift, but I strongly suspect that it was.  Either way, it is a marvelous setting, and the huge expanses of landscape add tremendously to the effectiveness of the film.  Second, the thousands of extras used in the film, played by actual Zulus, added enormously to the film's veracity.  Third, and perhaps most important, the primary members of the cast were nearly all exceptional.  I'll start with the exception first.  Jack Hawkins is one of my favorite character actors, and in films like THE CRUEL SEA and THE BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI he more than managed to portray magnificently men of action in the best British tradition.  But his role as Rev. Otto Witt just isn't very effective either dramatically or as a character.  But the rest of the cast is extraordinary.  Stanley Baker dominates this film, not just in his performance as the engineer who accidentally has the command of the troops come under his responsibility, but as the driving force to get the film made in the first place.  Much is made of this being Michael Caine's first significant film, but not many note that instead of playing a Cockney, he plays a product of the upper class, so that he is actually playing against type.  He acquits himself well, but his best performances would be in the future.  Nigel Green, who only a year later would costar with Caine in THE IPCRESS FILE, dominates nearly every scene he is in as Sgt. Bourne.  No matter how crazed the action around him, his character is an absolute rock.  James Booth is superb as Pvt. Hook, a shifty and lazy soldier who feigns injury to avoid fighting, but when the fighting comes to him manages to fight as well as anyone in the film.  Although his character seems to be the kind who is always on the verge of being thrown into the brig, according to the closing credits Pvt. Hook was actually one of several soldiers during that battle to be awarded the Victoria Cross.  In fact, according to those same credits, the defenders of Rorke's Drift won an extraordinarily large number of awards for bravery.  One would imagine that the number of citations surpasses that of any other military engagement in British history.
This is not a deep or complex film.  But that doesn't in any way keep it from being an enormously enjoyable one.  I can recommend it in the highest possible terms.",1049500800,3,2829,4.693711967545639

Michael Caine in his debut film, 3) it really happened.
The constant action is riveting even though it was made in the early 1960's and there's virtually no blood and gore.

It is a pity that  the film fails to mention one of the real heroes of Rorke's Drift - the Padre. According to contemporary accounts, the Rev Smith was as inspiration as he ran from man to man, carrying ammunition, roaring encouragement and powerful biblical texts. Back in Britain, he was known as one of the heroes of Rorke's Drift, and was 'mentioned in despatches.'
He became known as 'Ammunition Smith' because of the stirling work he did, handing out the ammunition. He was depicted as a very large, red-bearded man, slightly wild in appearance, in a painting of the seige.",1041120000,,847,4.722972972972973

Well-acted and masterfully directed, this DVD is one not to miss for military action fans. Unfortunately, the director took liberties with some historical facts. This in no way detracts from the film's enjoyment and will probably not matter to action buffs, but military history fans should be warned. As another reviewer has pointed out, the portrayal of Pvt. Hook as a malinger is dead wrong. In addition, the drunken missionary and his busty daughter were not at the scene as portrayed. Furthermore, Lieutenants Chard and Bromhead were not the clean-shaven, handsome and decisive leaders as portrayed in the film. Bromhead was close to stone deaf. This plus his generally assumed less than competent command presence led him to be left at Rorke's Drift while his regiment marched on. Lt. Chard was an engineering officer with little or no combat experience. In the film, Chard especially and Bromhead to some extent, are seen as making all the crucial defense strategies. In fact, it was a grizzled senior sergeant whose ideas were employed by the officers that led to the successful defense.
Again however, this film still manages to stir the soul and present a realistic view of the nightmarish defense of Rorke's Drift and the heroism of desperate men.",1040169600,7,1403,5.0257510729613735

363386,5,6301767918,"The massacre of nearly 1,500 British soldiers of the 24th Regiment of Foot on January 22nd, 1879 at Isandhlwana, Natal Province by warriors of the Zulu Nation is on record as the worst disaster ever inflicted on a modern army by a primitive one. After the battle at Isandhlwana, the Zulu warriors turned their attention to Rourke's Drift, a lonely Missionary station where the 24th had set up a supply depot and hospital. It is the desperate and courageous defense of this remote station by 140 British soldiers against the determined attacks of 4,000 Zulu warriors that is the subject of this film.
 Zulu is a historically accurate reproduction of the Defense of Rourke's Drift. Every detail is painstakingly accurate: the uniforms of British Infantry and Engineers, the Martini-Henry rifles and Webley revolvers, foil sealed cases of ammunition, and the tactics that were used by the besieged British to fight off the Zulus.
 Extraordinary acting performances are given by Michael Caine as Lieutenant Gonville Bromhead, the arrogant, aristocratic officer who is humbled by his experience of the battle, a performance made even more impressive by the fact that this was Caine's first film; Stanley Baker, the Officer of Engineers who takes command of the detachment and leads the heroic defense; Nigel Green as the brave, correct Colour-Sergeant Bourne, the rock-solid pillar of Britishness; and James Booth as the rebellious Private Hook who turns hero and saves many of his comrades.
 Narrated by Richard Burton and featuring spectacular cinematogrophy filmed on location in Natal, Zulu is a masterful telling of one of the greatest stories in the annals of Military History, and a shining moment in the history of British arms. Eleven Victoria Crosses were awarded to defenders of Rourke's Drift, and this film is a worthy tribute to their heroism. It should be in everyone's DVD library.",1035849600,43,1892,5.156351791530945
363387,4,6301767918,"Some time after seeing ZULU in theatrical release, I found Morris' *The Washing of the Spears* and learned that some significant details of the film were in error. For one thing, very few of the defenders of Rorke's Drift were the beardless young soldiers depicted in the movie, most of 'B' Company, 2/24th, being regulars of long service. For another, the depiction of Assistant Commissary James Langley Dalton as a fussy ""old maid"" type was unspeakably unfair. (Dalton was in fact a former Sergeant-Major with a Line Regiment, the 85th [Kings] Light Infantry, and was the individual responsible for convincing Lt. Chard to fortify and stand against the Ulundi Corps at the mission station.  For his courage and the role he played in the defense of the Drift he was himself quite justly awarded the Victoria Cross.)
In the 20th Century, we've become accustomed to seeing the ranks of infantry companies filled with young conscripts, usually 18 to 20 years of age, and we've lost touch with the fact that most of the ""Little Wars"" of Victorian England were fought by battalions of regulars wherein private soldiers were commonly in their late 20s and early 30s, with eight or ten years' service in their respective regiments. Moreover, we're inclined to think of noncombatant support troops like Commissary Dalton as ""civilians in uniform"" when in actuality they were likely to be hardened military veterans ""double-dipping"" in secondary careers (when they weren't active-duty NCOs or commissioned officers seconded to support functions).
Finally, there are the romantically heroic depictions of Chard and Bromhead with which ZULU has to contend, the characterizations of these officers being very much at odds with historical record. In reality, Rorke's Drift was almost entirely a Sergeants' fight, with Colour Sergeant Bourne and ex-Sergeant Dalton largely responsible for the successful organization and execution of a skillful and tenacious defense against incredible odds.
ZULU is an excellent action/adventure film, and stands up well even today, but it could have been even better had it been done with greater historical veracity, paying overdue tribute to the career enlisted men who made the British regimental system of the 19th Century the exemplary organizational model it was.",1035849600,30,2291,5.293956043956044

The film provides a wonderful insight into the Queen's gentleman's army and the rivalry between commissioned soldiers. The men are true to form, chancers, brave soldiers and normal scared ones.

There's also a confusing bit where Baker demands to know why Caine can't identify the bodies of his men after the hospital fire.

Fortunately, they are supported by efforts of the quintessential sergeant major that hardly breaks a sweat as he fights the fierce adversaries while maintaining proper British manners and discipline.

It is multi-dimensional, in that the British soldiers are not all noble, super-competent and brilliant -- and the Zulu warriors are not pictured simply as a mob of faceless, uncivilized ""native bad guys"". The first sight of the Zulu army appearing over the crest of the hill, as the camera slowly pans across the scene, is a truly heart-stopping spectacle.
""Zulu"" presents its audience with a seemingly irreconcilable crisis of wills, the ultimate resolution of which is, well, let me just say... ""satisfying"".

363446,5,6301767918,"Zulu is one of the greatest historical action movies ever made, and one of the great war movies.  It is based on what historian Michael Glover terms ""the most highly decorated battle in British history"", the defence of Rorke's Drift during the Zulu War of 1879.  Eleven of the defenders received Britain's highest award for military valor, the Victoria Cross--the rarely awarded counterpart of the US Medal of Honor.  The movie is a landmark in the art of cinema for its extraordinary combination of location, cross-cultural engagement, a real story, good script, fine cast and great production team. This 1964 film never looks tired, despite my many years of rerunning it in 16mm, the Criterion laserdisc, later the Front Row Entertainment Inc. DVD, and then the Paramount DVD and Blu-ray discs.  Anecdotally, military colleges have used Zulu to show the power of directed massed musketry, and leadership and teamwork in combat.

Zulu is the greatest achievement of the career of British actor Stanley Baker, who co-produced with US-born, formerly blacklisted director Cy Endfield. Nothing else in the genre really measures up, including Endfield's so-called ""prequel"",&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zulu-Dawn/dp/B0009UVCR6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zulu Dawn</a>, or other epics based on British colonial wars, such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Khartoum/dp/B000062XF0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Khartoum</a>.  It was filmed on location in the grandeur of Natal, South Africa, with descendants of the Zulu warriors who took part in the original action portraying their forebears. The prominent Zulu politician and traditional chief, Mangosuthu Buthelezi, plays the Zulu leader, his distant relative Cetewayo.  Mass Zulu participation in the project guaranteed the uplifting dignity and authenticity of cross-cultural characterisations of the film. Early magnificent scenes with masses of Zulu extras show the Zulu royal kraal, with a mass wedding of warriors in progress as news arrives of the annihilation of a strong British force at Isandhlwana.  These unique scenes probably never could be filmed again because of social and cultural change.  The nearest conceptual comparison in the war genre that comes to mind is the cross-cultural aspect of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tora-Tora-Tora-Blu-ray-Book/dp/B005OOSPZO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tora! Tora! Tora! [Blu-ray Book</a>]

Stanley Baker believed so strongly in Zulu, despite difficulties in raising finance, that he sank much of his own money into it. Playing a British Army engineer officer thrust by events into leading a desperate defensive action following the disaster of Isandhlwana, he heads a strong cast, including a young Michael Caine as an upper crust infantry officer. There are wonderful cameo roles by Jack Hawkins as an alcoholic missionary; Nigel Green as the imperturbable Colour Sergeant Bourne, always ready with a calming order or a bayonet; James Booth as Private Hook, portrayed (controversially to his descendants) as a malingerer who is perhaps the least likely Victoria Cross winner; Patrick Magee as Surgeon Reynolds, continuing up to his elbows in surgery even as Zulus try to break in. The narration by Richard Burton is very fine, and in character with the Welsh origin of the British soldiers. Welsh and Zulu singing on the cinematic battlefield is spine-tingling. As John Bender says in his attached comment, the musical score by John Barry enhances the grandeur and drama.

Michael Glover's 1997 book,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rorke-s-Drift-Wordsworth-Military-Library/dp/1853266736/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rorke's Drift (Wordsworth Military Library)</a>&nbsp;is recommended reading for anyone with a detailed interest in the historical background. Amazon stocks several other titles related to the Zulu Wars that I can't vouch for, but that other reviewers have rated highly.

Alan and Peter Critchley launched in 2000 an informative 'Rorke's Drift VC, 1879' military history enthusiasts' website which can be found by online searches. The website has extensive information I've seen nowhere else about the actual historical personalities portrayed in the film. This includes a magazine article published in 1905 about the account Alfred Henry ""Harry"" Hook VC (1850-1905) gave of the battle of Rorke's Drift; an account of the battle by Surgeon-Major James Henry Reynolds VC (1844-1932) published in 1928 by the Journal of the Royal Army Medical Corps; and a transcript of a radio broadcast in 1936 by Lieutenant Colonel Frank Bourne OBE, DCM (1854-1945) - who was the real Colour Sergeant Bourne played by Nigel Green in the movie.

The filming location used the escarpment of the Drakensberg mountain range as a backdrop - a more picturesque setting than the actual battlefield. The actual site of Rorke's Drift, only about 100 miles northeast of the filming location, can be seen in satellite imagery and visitor photos in Google Earth at coordinates 2821'0.00""S, 3032'0.00""E . Although the actual battlefield was not in the film, it is a tribute to the production that fans of the movie may be surprised by how familiar and understandable the terrain appears.

This film originally was released in 70mm. It deserved the very best frame-by-frame and soundtrack digital restoration and DVD transfer that technology can provide, working from original material.

See attached expert comment by John Sellars dated Sep 29, 2011 10:10:40 AM PDT for technical background drawn from his work on these transfers. I could not now recommend any releases of Zulu other than these from Paramount and MGM. The Paramount Blu-ray release of Zulu is magnificent in every respect.

363448,5,6301767918,"There are several reasons that mark Zulu as the greatest action movie of all time. Many critics point to the realistic battle scenes, the cinematic comraderie of the Brits at Rorke's Drift, and the fine acting of Michael Caine and Stanley Baker. If Zulu had only these, it would still be a magnificent battle movie. Yet what sets Zulu apart from other action movies is that a face and a voice are attached to the swarming Zulus. Even in the midst of the most ferocious battling, none of the Zulus is permitted to blend into the faceless blackness that so often fills movies that present Africans fighting Europeans.  See, for instance, any Tarzan movie in which the ugga-mugga blacks who attack the white caravans are indistinguishable from one another. In Zulu, each black warrior is shown as a fierce and proud individual who has chosen to sublimate his individuality into the formidable discipline of the ""Horns of the Bull.""  The grizzled chieftain controls his men with the same iron control as the British officers do their own red-coated men. And then there is the singing, which forms a cultural subtext to the movie.  The Zulus had different songs for attacking the enemy before battle and praising the enemy after battle. I could sense the cohesive Zulu culture from their songs, even if I could not understand the words.  When the Brits responded with their own songs, I felt their bravery in the face of impossible odds.  The only other movie that I have seen that could sway a listener with battle songs like this was ""The Battle of the Bulge"" when Nazi tank commanders led each other in a rousing, foot-stomping rendition of 'DER PANZERLIED.' Thus, Zulu is the rarest of all action movies. It shows the viewer that in war the enemy often has a face and a voice.",1016236800,2,1775,4.712903225806452

Worst of all though is the source of this transfer.  It's clearly not from a good print of the film. Instead, it looks like it was taken from videotape.  The picture quality was significantly worse than my own VHS copy, recorded on a budget VHS machine off the BBC several years ago!

363513,5,6301767918,"Based on a true story in British History in South Africa, this is aboslutely one of the best films of all times.  The late Sir Stanley Baker (whose superb performaces are mostly lost to past few generations), same with the late Jack Hawkins (Ben Hur), James Booth and Nigel Green, it was the film that introduced Michael Caine to the world, showing what a natural actor he was from the start.  (Caine, who originally tried out for the role of Hookie but lost to Booth, was almost fired from the film because the American backer, Joseph E. Levine, did not think Caine knew 'what to do with his hands'!!  Caine was imitating Prince Albert!!).  Fortunately, Baker ignored him.
Produced by Baker and Cy Enfield (of the Hollywood Blacklist fame) and written by the great historian John Prebble (Lion of the North - he also did the screenplay for Mysterious Island, another of Enfield's productions), the main focus of the film tells the story of a small pocket of British soldiers at Rorke's Drift on the edge of ZuluLand in 1879.  These soldiers were left there for two purposes: some were sick with fever so were in hospital, the posting commanded by Gonville Bromhead (Caine), and the rest to build a bridge across the Bufalo River commanded by royal engineer, John Chard.
Just 10 miles down the road a force of over 4000 thousand  British Solders camped on the hill of Islandlhwana were slaughtered by 10,000 Zulus.  The worst defeat in British history of a modern army facing a native force.  Over 4400 Zulu arrived too late for the attack, so they turned their attention to Rorke's drift and the little band of 100 men left there to defend it.
Baker and Caine (though not close in real life) worked magnificiently together, giving powerhouse performances, with a great supporting cast of relative unknowns.  The filming of South Africa is breathtaking, the enormity of what the soldier faced having 100 to 4400 odds, and how they held out until the main force of Chelmsford's army arrived, is an epic, but also a personal story of two men who stood resolute in the face of terror with a stiff upperlip and did what had to be done.
Moving Scoring by John Barry (Bond films, Raise the Titanic), with a foreword from Sir Richard Burton (a friend of Baker's both being Welsh).
In 1979, a prequel was filmed Zulu Dawn, nearly rising to this level, starring Burt Lancaster, Simon Ward and Nigel Davenport, that tells the story of the the massive defeat at Islandlhwana.  It is a shame they are not presented as a set.
Interesting note, at the start of the film showing King Chetewayo of the Zulus at Ulundi, Chetewayo is played by the real Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who is involved in South African Politics today.",1012262400,2,2716,4.698947368421052

  This version is a decent letterboxed transfer (In fact the transfer was superior to the big-studio DVD of South Pacific I'd watched the day before) with no artifacts whatsoever.  Color was slightly faded and the sound is monaural and terrible (a shame as this is perhaps John Barry's best score), but this is a limitation of the original print.

Not only does it have the best battle scenes ever shot but it points to the simple bravery shown on both sides of the fence.  The most amazing part of the movie is it is a true story (though the hook character in reality was no wasterl.)
From the color sgt. (Who as the last survivor of Rorke's Drift survived one day longer than Hitler's thousand year reich) to the
singing welch choir leader we see men that we can't help but like fighting, dying and surviving as best they can in an impossible situation.
Even though the movie is 20 years older than the days of political correctness (which I detest.) it passes that test too.  The Zulu aren't shown as savages, (in fact when a soldier does refer to them as such he is rebuked by another.) they are shown as brave warriors with a sense of honor.
The only weakness to this movie is the minister's daughter who has no real place in the picture.  She is just there for show and adds little or nothing.  The acting in general is fine, but as every review of this picture correctly says, the battle scenes are the real stars of this film.

  As far at it being my favorite this movie has an unfair advantage over every other movie I've ever seen.  I used to watch it on Non Cable TV on fuzzy UHF channels whenever it was on with my big brother.  We would park in front of the set with Italian Bread Roast Beef , Provolone and italian wine (or root beer in my case, I was a kid.) and indulge ourselves.  Since in those days it was only on maybe once every three months we would view it as an event.  (The dance scenes on regular Tv were of great interest to a pre-teen boy at the time as well.)

363679,4,6301767918,"Thought as a accurate depiction of an actual historical event, zulu surprises by great direction from Cy Endfield, and performances from Micheal Caine (one of his first on screen), Stanley Baker, Jack Hawkins, and the great Nigel Green. Historians may find some of the events a little bit questionable, however military film fans will be pulled in by the action and superb characterizations. The story starts in early 1879, after the defeat of several thousand british soldiers by Zulu warriors at Iswandhlwana. The news flashes to a small encampment of british soldiers who are building a bridge over a tiny river. This group has two commanders, Caine and Baker, but it is baker who really has seniority. Other problems occur when a preacher and his daughter (played well by Hawkins and Ulla Jacobsson) arrive from the Zulu village to take away some of Baker's wounded. After their departure, the Zulu's appear. Magnificent and powerful looking, the Zulus strike like a force of nature, swarming over the camp several times in the movie. My only critique about the picture is the empty depiction of the Zulus. They seem almost robotic-like, fighting without fear--then immediately retreating--only to attack again. Perhaps of few scenes of them tending to their own wounded or showing them forming battle-attack scenarios could've made them seem more ""human"" in my opinion. That might not be fair to the filmmakers, who because of budget, story and time constraints could only focus on one side of the film. Still, many of the british characters are a tight mixture of hardcore soldiers and nasty troublemakers (James Booth excellent portrayal as Hook is a coward who will eventually turn hero). Director Enfield and writer John Prebble had set up shots and created sequences that make the look of the film simple but eye-catching. Enfield, Prebble and lead actor Stanley Baker (who also co-produced), whittled the film to its bare essentials...it is a war film. Nothing more, nothing else. The reasons for british occupation, the Zulu's brutality, or race and religion is not brought up. Which in my opinion was a good move on their part; they kept it fast and full realistic combat scenes. After watching the film, you'll have greater respect for soldiers and tribal warriors of that period, and a reconition that war is something to take lightly. Kudos are also deserved by cinematographer Stephen Dade (who produced great shots all on location!)and the great John Barry (the score is sweeping and quite memorable). The film is also narrated by Richard Burton. It is also sad to note that many of the Zulu actors were not allowed to see the film when it premiered in South Africa at the time.

363680,5,6301767918,"Zulu is probably the best action movie that I've ever seen. It has plot, suspense, action, and guns.
Zulu is the story of the battle of Rorke's Drift, between British soldiers and Zulu warriors. To summarize, about a hundred British soldiers manage to hold a few buildings attacked by thousands of Zulu.
The best scene in the film occurs when the Zulu shout a battle ""song"" down at the soldiers. The soldiers sing back with a Welsh song called Men of Harlech. The dichotomy is striking; the beautiful European melody against the Zulu chant. It's a very powerful scene.
I very much enjoyed fighting the Zulu vicariously through the British infantrymen.",998179200,4,651,4.873873873873874
363681,5,6301767918,"As I read throught the near 100 reviews for Zulu, I noticed only a mere handful of them were written by women. I suppose this shouldn't be suprising as this is one of the greatest adventure films ever...a real ""Alpha Male Movie"". However, there is much for a woman to appreciate here as well, which is why I'm surprised that so few women have viewed it. I saw Zulu when it was first released in 1964. My father, a huge fan of Ian Flemming, had taken our family to the Thunderbird Drive-In in Phoenix to see Dr. No. In those days you got two movies for the price of one, with the main feature showing last. As luck would have it...good luck, indeed...Zulu played first. We had heard nothing of this movie and were totally unprepared for the emotional punch it would deliver. I can honestly say, that if it were not for video I would remember virtually nothing of Dr. No...with the exception of the now famous scene of bikini clad Ursula Andress emerging from the sea...and this only because of my father's lascivious comments and my mother's jolting elbo jab to his ribs. However, there is hardly a scene from Zulu that I don't recall. For the individual who has never had the good fortune to see Zulu, the movie begins with the massacre of over 1,000 soldiers encamped on the slopes of the mountain at Islandwana, which in turn forces the tiny Mission station at Rourkes Drift...manned by only a few hundred soldiers...into what seems an impossible situation. Luckily for everyone, Lt. John Chard (played brillantly by Stanley Baker)has been assigned to Rourkes Drift to build a bridge. With his wisdom, sharp military mind and courage, he is able to turn a band of bored and untested men into British soldiers of the highest calibur...and in the process...honored as warriors by the Zulu. Although this is Michael Caines' first film, he's superb in the role of the snobbish and class conscious Lt. Gonville Bromhead who has his stength of character tested but ultimatley proved. Supporting actors, James Booth (Private Henry Hook)Nigel Green (Colour Sergeant Frank Bourne)and David Kernan (Fred Hitch) are also standouts. Now I admit that I'm reviewing this movie from a somewhat different perspective than many of the other reviewers. Although this movie is based on an actual event, I'm not overly concerned with whether, or not, the British uniforms are regulation and authentic...or, if in fact the actual Lt. Chard and Lt. Bromhead were indeed in reality much older than either Stanley Baker, or Michael Caine. It seems to me if you are an individual who is that focused on historical accuracy in your movies, you're better of watching either PBS or the History Channel...which by the way HAS shown Zulu, complete with commentary by historians who find this film, with a few exceptions, and accurate depiction of the events surrounding the siege at Rourkes Drift. From the opening voice over by Richard Burton, as well as the scene of Welch soldiers singing before a pre-battle dawn, to the unforgettable images of three level firing lines on a redoubt, this is one of the greatest adventure movies ever made...even if you aren't male. This movie has more heart and passion for all it's testosterone than most ""Chick Flicks"" It's heart pounding, nail biting, inspiring movie making at it's best.

363682,5,6301767918,"Hi everyone- Just to add to the prior and articulate superb reviews:  The most intriguing part of this film to me were the combat scenes that demonstrated the line and box firing system that the British were the first to implement that maximized the concentrated use of their firepower.  It was with this system 50 years prior that Wellington employed to defeat the Napoleonic forces at Waterloo, and the film does a wonderful and graphic job depicting it.  Being rushed by hundreds of Zulu warriors at a time- The British forces would line up in 2 ranks- (This was in the single shot Martini-Henry breech loading rifle days) After the first rank fired-They would squat down and move forward, and the rear rank would then fire and repeat the process.  As a result, the mighty Zulus were met with deadly sheets of hot lead that ultimately halted their agressive killing rushes and made them retreat in the carnage filled battle scenes.  I may be going out on a limb here- But Zulu is so action and adventure filled; I'm calling it the BEST war epic prior to the release of Platoon 23 years later.  No room for ladies here folks- This one is strictly a high testosterone offering for guys who love war movies.  Superb.",993772800,,1216,4.627906976744186
363683,5,6301767918,"150 British, 1 Swiss, and 1 Boer against 5,000 Zulu warriors.  Zulu is the true story of one group of British protecting the mission outpost of Rourke's Drift from the coming onslaught of a united force of the fearsome and brave Zulu warriors.  This film picks up right after the Zulu army swept down and massacred a British regiment at Isandwhala (featured in the prequel Zulu Dawn).  The battle of Rourke's Drift was seemingly hopeless, but these brave men held out against an army of sheer numbers - with the most Royal Crosses being awarded in a single campaign.
The first half of this film entails the preparation and seemingly hopelessness that the Brits were going through in order to set-up some sort of defensive perimeter - after the 1st hour the Zulus approach - eeiry - hearing them rattle their shields (sounding like a locomotive) and it echoe throughout the countryside - and when they break into song before the attack - you can feel your own knees shake.  The battles are realistic and brutal (very accurate - a good account of this story can be found in the book - Like Lions They Fought) - and the Zulus are very well planned in this assault - with snipers and multi-pronged flanking moves - very impressive.  After 2 days and one night of fighting - the Biritish, completely spent and nearly out of ammo - prepare for what is to be the last wave - only to hear the Zulu's break into song and chant - told to them by the Boer that the Zulus are saluting them as fellow warriors - Powerful to say the least.  Just the sight of 5,000 Zulu warriors appearing on the cliffs surrounding the fort is an unforgetable sight.
The DVD for this @ $10 or less is a real steal - with a non-anamorphic widescreen transfer, cast bios, chapter stops (only 6), and other titles available.  The sound is in Dolby Pro Logic but sounds quite nice.  The age of the film shows with some fading and washing of the colors - but overall I think it is a good deal since who knows when this will, if ever, be released in better (remastered version) in Region 1.  In this widescreen version, I was able to easily notice the monument built to commerate this battle in at least 3 scenes briefly (it looks likes a flagpole).  Also of note is - this is Michael Caine's first movie and he's pretty good in it (not too likeable though). A great movie to see as is Shaka Zulu (also on DVD) and hopefully we'll see a release of Zulu Dawn as well.",991958400,8,2429,4.401785714285714

The British had been looking for a large, decisive confrntation; unfortunately, they found it. At Roarke's drift, however, they put up a heroic stand using superb defensive tactics. The director, Cy Enfield, does an excellent job building up the suspense prior to the battle. Shot on location in South Africa, this film honors the bravery of both the Zulus and the British.

Things Wrong: Gonville Bromhead (what a name!) was not a young officer but verging on middle age, as was Chard. There is no evidence of any tension between them, (but that wouldn't have made for a very interesting movie would it?) and seniority was settled well in advance of the battle when their CO went off to Natal or wherever leaving Chard in command. Both men seem to have been very average officers but there is no question they rose magnificently to the occasion when disaster struck.  Commissary Dalton is often given credit for directing the defense, if true Chard and Bromhead deserve credit for acting the advice of an old soldier.  The missionary and his daughter are entirely fictional, (but good characters anyway).  The real Private Hook was a model soldier and teetotaler yet!

363744,5,6301767918,"Overall, this is a great movie. And by comparison with some more recent movies, pretty historically accurate.  It has great atmosphere, terrifying battle scenes and marvellous singing by both sides.
There are a number of useful books on the Zulu War that might be interesting for viewers. One is Donald Morris' ""Washing of the Spears"" which is a fairly traditional historical account and the other is ""Like Lions They Fought"" by Robert Edgerton which is written with the Zulu perspective in mind.
For the record, in real life Chard and Bromhead were both much older than they are played (oh so unflappably) by Michael Caine and Stanley Baker  in the movie and although individually very brave (as was expected of British officers of the time) were both basically incompetent as military men.  As their subsequent records show, neither distinguished himself any further and both were regarded as idiots by their military peers (men who themselves took the definition of 'idiot' to new heights). The real hero of Rourke's Drift was Colour Sergeant Bourne who rallied the men, organized the defence, supervised the fighting and made sure his superiors looked good.
In reality, British casualties at Rorke's Drift were predominantly caused by rifle fire.  One of the Zulu regiments had a large supply of British rifles (a portion of those taken from the dead at Isandhlawana) and ample ammunition. However, most of their fire went high because the Zulu riflemen were untrained in the use of the backsight. Had they been better trained, the Brits would have been blasted off the face of the earth in fairly short order.
All these points aside, the movie did give a wonderful impression of the battle.  Certainly the 24th behaved remarkably well especially given the twits who were in command.
However, my vote for courage bordering on insanity goes to the Zulus (many of whom were actually middle-aged men) who repeatedly charged a well-disciplined, well-supplied enemy armed with breach-loading rifles who were behind fortifications.  Zulu accounts repeatedly mention British bullets smashing through several men at a time and the wounded almost always died from the massive injuries caused by the .45 caliber soft lead slugs.  There were at least three charges during the course of the battle and Zulu assaults stopped because the men were too exhausted physically and emotionally to mount another attack. The whole battle was a very near run thing for everyone.
As a final historical note, the Zulus were able to inflict serious losses on the Imperial Army on two subsequent occasions. Mostly by taking advantage of broken ground and poor co-ordination between units that were supposed to be supporting one another.
The final set peice battle at Ulundi was a foregone conclusion however: British troops were arrayed in a massive square on flat, open ground with artillery, machine guns and cavalry support. There was no opportunity for Zulu troops to outmanouevre the Brits and surprise an unprepared encampment as they had at Isandhlwana, and the ammunition wagons were close by the British firing lines to avoid the problems with re-supply that may have also contributed to the earlier British defeat.
Zulu generals had implored Ceteshwayo to withdraw but he insisted on fighting for political reasons, probably also knowing that his men stood little chance against massed rifles.  The flower of the Zulu army was decimated in the initial attacks and organized resistance to the British invasion collapsed soon after. The battle of Ulundi was remarked upon by several British and other observers as sheer slaughter, but was served up hot to a British public eager for revenge for the humiliation the Zulus had inflicted on them at Isandlhawana the previous year.",988243200,29,3762,5.13562091503268

I'm very glad that I didn't.  I had no problems whatsoever with this DVD.  There was very little pixellation.  I have found very few movies that don't have a tiny bit that is noticeable at some point or another.
I ran into no problems with the first chapter of the movie not playing and I thought that for a 6 or 7 dollar DVD the transfer was very good.  Also it was presented in letterbox format.
I'm not sure why others had teh problems that they did, but they were nowhere to be found on my copy.
Keep in mind that you are not buying the definitive criterion collector's edition here.  This was a great bargain in my opinion.  There were few, if any real extras.  In the end, either I am very lucky, they have changed the version released on DVD or I have the lowest standards on earth (and I don't think the last one is the case), but I was happy with the DVD.",981676800,4,982,4.158730158730159

This movie is brilliant. It brings back so many memories of the first time I saw it, at the cinema in Sunderland with a group of friends. I was about 11 and I remember how spellbound I was. My younger brothers were too, and for months afterwards they would re-enact the battle scenes in our front room, with couch cushions for barricades and toy rifles. They even sang ""Men of Harlach"". Then I turned 18, moved to Canada, got married and had a son. And what was his favourite movie growing up? You got it...Zulu. When he was about 6 or 7 we visited my parents in England and they had this movie on tape and my son did just what my bros did all those years before. Re-enact the battle scenes in the front room in the same way. He even learnt the words to ""Men of Harlach"" and sang along with the movie every time. Some things never change. And good movies are always good movies.
The fact, too, that this is based on a true story, makes it all the more exciting as well as a good history lesson. My son is now 21, and it's still the movie of choice that he puts on when friends come over...especially if they haven't seen this film before. This is a must have...but don't get the DVD version.

For my money though, pierecing green eyed Nigel Greene steals the show as the rock-solid Colour Seargeant Bourne, the archetypal ramrod-straight British army NCO which helped the English rob a quarter of the world from its rightful owners.
As Greene's character replies to one youthful squaddie who has the temerity to question 'why us?' in the face of the asegi-waving black horde, ""We're 'ere because you're 'ere son. Just us, and no one else!""

Bromhead, and, best of all, James Booth's smoulderingly rebellious Pvt. Hook.  Zulu is a funny, gritty, and intelligent portrayal of an amazing historical event.

You get to see the characters personal querks.  It is the mark of good character developement when you can talk about a character as if you really know them.  You can do this after you watch Zulu.  The film is not biased as you see the Zulus and British points of view.  I liked this as it doesn't label any party as being 'right' or 'wrong'. Zulu is filmed right on site and this adds to the fact that it is historically correct.  When you watch a film such as this one.  It always adds to the quality to see it depicted correctly.  It is the same with the officers uniforms and the way the Zulus planned their attack.  Zulu also show the stresses and strains of the battle.  You see the intense bravery and courage of both parties.  The human sacrifice is another factor.  You see the way the soldiers think and it amazes you to think the British 'won' when it was 40 zulus to one Englishman.  It makes you cringe at the thought. Overall, Zulu is a classic and should not be forgotten.  A must for everyone to watch.  I recommend it to all.",970444800,3,1187,4.255605381165919

Nevertheless the movie does an excellent job of capturing the fear and courage of both sides. It captures the essence of being a soldier and the sheer desperation of the men involved in what seemed to be a hopeless fight. It's a classic and I highly reccommend it.

363855,5,6301767918,"January 22-23 1879 will go down as one of the greatest and bravest days in British military history.
The battle at Rorke's Drift, or as the Zulus  called it ""Jim's Place"" is magnificently portrayed in this 1964  epic filmed on location in Natal.
Michael Caine perfectly plays the part  of Lieutenent Gonville Bromhead, a gentleman and professional soldier who  along with Lieutenent John Chard of the Royal Engineers (played by Stanley  Baker) masterminded the defence of the small missionary station at Rorke's  Drift.
80 men of the South Wales Borderers 24th Regiment Of Foot defended  the missionary station and it's 36 wounded men in the hospital against  4,000 zulu warriors.
The Natal scenery and costumes of both the British  soldiers and Zulu warriors are a highlight.
The battle scenes were  graphically ahead of it's time and the narration by Richard Burton (himself  a welshman)certainly adds to the drama that would unfold.
One criticism  is levelled at the characterization of Private Alfred Henry Hook, who in  the movie is portrayed as a drunken malingerer. He was in fact a gentleman  and small landowner who was a well regarded soldier. He was awarded the  Victoria Cross for his bravery in evacuating the sick and wounded from the  burning hospital.
Overall, as an avid historian on the Zulu War of 1879,  I found this a compelling movie classic which has been watched over and  over again by me and my 3 brothers( Tom, Chris and Sam)

363856,5,6301767918,"This film is based on a true story about an undermanned British army outpost facing an advancing force of Zulu warriors forty times greater in  number.
Stanley Baker as Lt. John Chard, an engineer sent to the post to  construct a bridge, takes command. Much out of his element, he commands the  infantrymen relying on his dormant leadership qualities and self-doubting  fortitude. How he manages that task and if he succeeds or fails is the  essence of the story.
The battle scenes of the outnumbered British  against the Zulu warriors are spectacularly and excitingly filmed as they  try to overrun the compound. From a filmmaking standpoint, it is  interesting how the Zulu warriors are portrayed in a more noble fashion  than their counterpart British soldiers who are portrayed somewhat in a  cliched manner.
John Barry's excellent score brings the intensity of the  battle sequences and heroics to an almost euphoric frenzy.
However  callous this may sound, Cy Endfield's insightful direction demonstrates to  the viewer the uncommon qualities of bravery that can only be brought to  fruition through war.

363901,5,6301767918,"There has been much said of the mindset of the British Empire at this date, but it was self assured and vigorous, with gingoism many years still to run.  Here at last it found a foe valiant and numerous enough to give it  pause. This film in my opinion captures the essence of the experience of  the common soldier in an action to which his training and character are put  to the ultimate test. If you cannot save enough pennies to visit Rourkes  Drift, then go to a glen, wadi or canon near where you live - where you are  surrounded by hills and stand looking up at them around you and then  imagine hundreds of zulu warriors bearing down on you from all sides, and  try to feel the courage and faith in comrades,training,discipline,equipment  and superior officers which made the men stand and fight and survive.  Then walk to the foot of one of those hills and imagine the courage and  discipline which it took for the Impis to charge again and again into the  disciplined withering fire of a regiment - whose brothers in arms in the  not too distant future, albeit with better rifles, mauled and repulsed the  flower of the Imperial German Infantry at Mons,with similar disciplined  fire. This is the essence of the greatness of the film.  You are there -  feeling the action unfold around a band of courageous men facing almost  impossible odds.  These soldiers are no apologists of latter day political  analysts wondering as to the reason of their being there, but soldiers of  an expanding vigorous empire, sure in their faith of friend and training,  in possession of a strong point with the equipment and mettle to defend it  to the last.  Their faith in the regiment, army and the mystical Queen  Empress a background to the camaradie and sense of belonging which only a  unit under fire can really understand. It is one of the ironies of combat  that any prolonged engagement leads each side to come too value the courage  and persistance of the enemy.  We can see this developing as the film  unfolds. I found this film a moving treatment of the action, its accuracy  was impressive and it did capture the frenetic pace of combat interspersed  with the boredom and the graveyard humor of the wait until the next attack.  As far as I have been able to research the characters were portrayed with  accuracy.  It is interesting to note that the mindset of the British Army,  which would send its men into action, for some years in the future, as  brightly dressed scarlet targets and would award 11 V.C.'s for gallantry to  officers and men, but to Colour Sargeant Bourne whose calmness under fire  and courage in repelling Zulu attacks were accurately portrayed, it awarded  the Distinguished Conduct Medal, apparently the job description for Colour  Sargeant includes heroism which therefore needed no special recognition.

It is Michael Caine's first major role and his performance, combined with that of the fantastic Stanley Baker, make this  film a true classic. The quality of the conversion is less than perfect,  but it is an involving piece and the fact that it actually happened makes  it all the more thrilling. The heroism and 'guts' of the 150 soldiers,  faced with over 4,000 Zulus, more than comes across and thrills all the  way!

363903,5,6301767918,"I saw this film on the big screen when it was first issued. In those days, film-making was  turning toward ""realism"" -- a parched face, a hot desert, a bleeding shoulder --and I was stunned. Filmgoers had never  seen anything like it. I saw it a few months ago, and I am still impressed.  This is absolutely one of the best films I have ever seen -- even when  compared to the special effects of today.
The action takes place much  later than the 18th Century suggested by another reviewer. In fact, the  action takes place at the turn of the 19th/20th Centuries, when the British  Empire was at it's height -- before WWI. The story isn't just an  ""action thriller"" as some suggest, but poses a question Brits  were beginning to ask at the time, ""Why are we here?""  The film  was made just after WWII, when the last remnants of the Empire were  collapsing, and Brits were asking, ""Why were we there.""
The  film celebrates the heroism of British soldiers -- all were decorated, some  with the Victoria Cross.  And it celebrates the valor of the Zulu warriors,  a fierce proud people who wanted freedom. The Zulu Nation helped the  British film company make the film by playing themselves. I believe the  film was shot in South Africa, but it may have been shot in what was then  British East Aftica.
This is not ""The Alamo."" The film takes a  hard look at the futility and sadness of killing an enemy you should  respect. The British ""won"" because the Zulu Nation decided to let  them live -this in recognition of their bravery.
This film introduced  the Great Michael Caine to America, and although younger viewers will not  recognize the other cast members, they are all wonderful British actors.",958262400,8,1697,4.58
363904,5,6301767918,"I am a war veteran, but not a combat veteran.  People say ""Platoon"", ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" are great war movies or have great war scenes in them.  I  enjoyed all of them, and my favorite ""battle scene"" was the  prisoners ""playing"" Russian Roulette in the prison camp.  That  was not exactly a battle scene, perhaps, but it was about men who find guts  under fire and men who collapse.
My favorite war movie became and still  is ""Zulu"".  Few soldiers, even long time cambat veterans, have  ever been through anything like the battle at Rourke's drift.  It is an  interesting study in courage under pressure or perhaps it is Hemingway's  grace under pressure.
It is not as though the men were fighting for  anything other than the survival of themselves or of their mates, but what  distinguished them is in the face of overwhelming odds, they kept fighting.  Sometimes, when the threat is so overwhelming and survival seems  impossible, many men must just give up.
I think it is interesting to  contrast ""Zulu"" with ""Custer's Last Stand"", an event  that shared the 1870's with the battle at Rourke's Drift. How could three  hundred trained and well armed soldiers be wiped out without at least  killing a comparable number of Indians? The Indians had more rifles than  the Zulu, and many of them were skilled shots, but if the cavalry had  hunkered down and made the Indians come to them, how could they not have  left hundreds or even a thousand of their enemies dead?  Somehow, the  soldiers did not fight well.
Anyway, the story is great and well told.  There are so many memorable scenes - the attack on the hospital, the battle  of the choirs, the Sargeant Major calling the names of the living and the  dead.  Even though Michael Caine's teeth look a little otherworldly, the  performances were great.
Finally, it also contains my  favorite""continuity"" blooper.  Somewhere in the second half,  Baker has his pistol in his hand and he is talking to people.  He splits  the pistol so the chambers are loadable.  Then the scene becomes more of a  closeup, and Baker raises the pistol again, and breaks it open again.  Oops.",958176000,4,2146,4.728260869565218

Armed with the rifles of the dead British soldiers  their next target is a mission station called Rourke's Drift, a tiny  enclosure consisting of a hospital and a chapel protected by only 100 men  including the wounded. With only hours to spare and the knowledge of a  native Boer, Aardendorff, they prepare their defences and wait. Then the  Zulus come.

363954,5,6301767918,"From the beautiful majestic background terrain to the real Zulu's used in the Filming....Zulu grabs your attention and keeps you riveted until the end.  I found myself tense wondering how the 100 odd British soldiers  could manage to hold off over 4,000 Zulu warriors.  The volley firing of  their Martini-Henry rifles was inspiring, and except for a few stale  dramatic lines of dialogue, the movie is well made as well as exciting.
My favorite character was Colour Sergeant Bourne.  The Actor portraying  him did a great job, I'd follow him into action any day.  His facial  expressions were prefect and he had some of the best lines in the movie,  also. ""mark ye targets""....""say sir, officer on  parade""....""there's a good gentleman"" come to mind.
For  those who don't know, the British soldiers there actually suffered very few  fatal casualties....about 10 I believe.  Amazing, when you realize that  they were fighting at very close quarters and sometimes even hand to hand.  Well done, Men of Harlech.",949190400,4,1009,5.024242424242424
363955,3,6301767918,"Zulu is an excellent movie. It contains good acting, great scenery, an interesting plot, and lots of action with a minimum of gore. I would recommend it to almost anyone. The DVD is of poor quality. The widescreen  version that I have seen on PBS stations is of considerably better quality  and makes the film much more spectacular. I recommend the film highly, but  perhaps the widescreen VHS is a better choice than this DVD. Definitely a  high quality widescreen DVD would be the best.",948412800,43,488,4.705882352941177

363958,5,6301767918,"I had to think carefully about how to rate this film. One star would indicate an awful film, but, this is one of the best historical films I've ever seen. However, the copy of the film is awful. It is grainy and blurred  for the most part, but, if this doesn't bother you and you can afford $5,  buy it. I doubt a better version will be released. Although an old film,  there are some absolutely wonderful moments of dialogue in the film along  with some laughable death scenes (but, all the Zulu extras were amateus, so  don't judge too harshly). The pride and aggression of these people shines  through, along with some pointed references to the lack of right of the  British to be there. Michael Cain is outstanding as the aristocratic,  upperclass officer. If you realize that this was an actual incident and can  place yourself in the event along with the men there, you really get a  sense of the fear and tension present. From a purely historical viewpoint,  it is important to realize that the Zulu's that attacked Rorkes Drift were  not the same band of Zulu's that had wiped out 1500 British soldiers  earlier in the day. Trulely, a wonderful film.",944611200,2,1158,4.563106796116505
363989,5,6301767918,"This story concerns the battle of Rourke's Drift during which a company of British soldiers, derelicts, and misfits held off five thousand Zulu warriors in South Africa.  The movie was filmed on location at the exact  spot where the incident took place.  Real Zulus were used in the cast which  includes Stanley Baker as an Engineer officer and introducing Michael Caine  as a upper-crust British officer/gentleman. The film depicts how this band  of men held out for three days against incredible odds, after a much larger  force had been massacred at Isanlawada. Brilliantly acted, by a cast of  well known British journeyman actors the action is non-stop.  Recommended  as one of the best war movies ever made.",942192000,37,713,5.017094017094017
363990,5,6301767918,"For those of us who have never experienced the sting of battle Zulu is a wake up call. Soldiers do not choose their battles, this is left to rulers,politicians and generals. Zulu depicts the common man rising to the  defence of his brothers in arms to survive insurmountable odds and defeat  an enemy not of his choosing. It is a testament to individual courage.",942105600,3,362,4.640625
363991,5,6301767918,"Great action & great performances! The story of how a little over 100 men successfully defended a hastily re-enforced farmhouse & kraal, for a whole night, against some 4,000 Zulu warriors, is well known. This was  Michael Caine's first movie & such a fine commencement to a wonderful  career, must have made it difficult for him to improve on his maiden  performance. His role of an inexperienced, unsure, upper-class young  British officer is brilliantly under-played. Whilst an essentially  unlikeable character, Caine makes the audience warm to him. His dislike of  Chard (Stanley Baker) is slowly replaced by a grudging respect & the  interplay between the two actors is a great study. Epic scale action that  would be difficult to beat, plus fine parts played by those in the smaller  roles. Worthy of particular mention is the wonderful character of the  cucumber-cool Colour-Sargeant Major. If you only ever see one action movie,  make it this one!",936316800,7,956,5.103225806451613
363992,5,6301767918,"I have watched this movie 15 times and never tire of it.  It is historically accurate, of course.  Its real strength lies in its honest exploration of the English class system (ironic that poor boy Michael Caine  grows up to be an actor, and his first role is playing an aristocrat in  this film) and in its honesty about the English role in South Africa, and  its unabashed admiration of the strength, valor and bravery of the Zulu  people. The compelling battle scenes owe much to skillful editing.  A must  have for any collection.",927936000,,534,4.6063829787234045
363993,5,6301767918,"Zulu is one of those gems of a movie that doesn't receive as much positive attention as it should. Even though it lacks spaceships, Julia Roberts or morphing, this intense, beleiveable and cerebral offering about British  troops under attack by thousands of Zulu warriors is a white knuckle ride.  Terrific acting and great music only contribute to this entertaining movie.  A must see!",924739200,,386,5.095238095238095

7815108,5,6301767918,"One of the finest ""war"" movies ever made, this dramatizes the 1879 defense of a South African mission station by a small garrison of British troops when attacked by a much larger force of Zulu warriors. It features one of the first movie appearances of Michael Caine as the junior officer of the garrison, and the actual current (in 1964, when the movie was made) Zulu chief playing the chief in 1879.  John Barry created a memorable - and suitably ominous - score for this movie; unlike so many more recent film, the music enhances rather than intrudes on the movie itself. (Back in the 60's, they didn't habitually turn up the music volume so much it drowned out the dialog like they do today.) The Blu-Ray disc is a good transfer, but it's not hugely better than the DVD version.",1523664000,,782,4.546099290780142
