4948521,5,B0063V696O,"A truly lovely and entertaining film.
Though set firmly in the traditions of Bollywood with colour, heart-warming relationships and wonderful music, it stretches into new territory with brilliant VFX and the exploration of a new genre, namely the superhero movie.

See it for the smile it will bring to your face.  As the tag-line says 'A Superhero with HART'.",1321660800,15,360,5.084745762711864
4948522,1,B0063V696O,"Ra. One is one helluva over-hyped, glorified video game show on a big screen. That's what it's all about. Not forgetting over acting from SRK( I don't think he should attempt to be funny or do any comedy at all). The only redeeming features are the songs and thank god for that! Avoid it unless you are a kid under 10 years old.",1321660800,7,328,4.222222222222222
4948523,5,B0063V696O,"If you missed this in the theater, you must see the DVD.  This movie has taken ""Bollywood"" to an all other playing field.  It is bringing them much more even with ""Hollywood"".  In fact in my opinion HW had better watch out!  I am from the USA and saw it with my daughter who has never watched a Hindi movie, she was surprised at how much she enjoyed it.  My grandson's first words when it was over ""Can we see it again?"" Needless to say we will be buying the DVD.  A wonderful family film, with fantastic special effects, and a strong message about family love.
The reviews in America, especially ""Hollywood"" were very good. But something is very wrong with the ""Bollywood Movie System""  this movie was treated very unfairly by the Indian press, I feel very sorry for the Indian public who did not see this film.  Not only have they missed a wonderful film but they have missed Hindi film history in the making.  The people who have written bad reviews on here never saw this film ""Period""  I have watched 100s of Bollywood films, and this one ranks in the top, for story, acting and special effects.
If you are an International film buff, you must see it.  If you have kids you all must see it.  If you just love a good time, fun and want to see a new super hero you must see. I know you will enjoy it!",1321488000,35,1303,4.252032520325203
4948524,5,B0063V696O,I loved it and don't really care what anyone else has to say about it because I love all the actors.  Can't wait to have it.,1321315200,2,124,3.769230769230769
4948525,1,B0063V696O,"One of the worst movies ever created in Indian film industry. Being a big fan of Science fiction and special effect movies as well as good hindi cinema, I watched this movie first day first show with family.  I invited all the kids from family and friend as this movie was suppose to be a kid or family friendly. It was utterly disgusting.  I simply cannot believe that a superstar and good actor like SRK made such a horrible movie. Its a random mixture of scenes stolen from known Hollywood movies with Bollywood song & dance and poor language stereo type jokes. I guess they forgot the fact that even SRK movie needs a story, a plot and a screen play. Please save your money and wait for another SRK movie.  This is complete waste of time.",1321142400,9,742,4.401459854014599
4948526,1,B0063V696O,"The movie clearly lacks substance and entertainment, lets accept it SRK can't act except under some very good director and he looks artificial and melodramatic in most scenes. Effects are only average, he created a huge hype for the movie by investing tons on money in promotion. Wish he he had invested that in a better story and screenplay writer. Stay clear!",1321056000,5,361,4.838709677419355
4948527,5,B0063V696O,"I saw this in the theater recently and I look forward to owning it. Before seeing this film, I had never even heard of SRK, so the intricacies of Bollywood pop culture were irrelevent as I sat and enjoyed this outstanding film.

I should begin by saying that Hollywood superhero films like The Dark Knight have nothing to worry about from this film. Ra. One doesn't try to be gritty or dark or realistic.  It is a family film, closer to the Christopher Reeve Superman films, in that it tries to be both sweet and thrilling. As a result it comes across as simultaneously modest and, because of its technological aspects, incredibly ambitious. Compared to the family fare churned out by Hollywood, it is never calculated and unlike Hollywood superhero films, it is never pretentious. From beginning to end, it simply wants to be the most entertaining film it could possibly be. Remarkably it succeeds far more frequently than it fails.

The highlights are the two extended action sequences. The first is a car chase through London that ends in a spectacular parking lot battle. The other, an even more astounding sequence, involves a runaway train and some remarkable stunt work and trick photography. Almost as good are the musical numbers, particularly Chammak Challo and Criminal. In a lesser film these interludes might have dragged the story to a halt, but in this film, they are made integral to the plot (and besides, are filled with such delight and affection for the characters that they can be forgiven almost anything).

As for the plot itself, it borrows freely from films like Terminator 2 and The Matrix. The hero, G.One (played by Sharukh Khan) is a video game character come to life, his mission to protect the son of his creator (also played by Mr. Khan in a very funny role). The film sets up its rules on how G.One and his nemesis, the evil Ra. One operate in the opening sequences and remarkably sticks to these rules for the most part. The story is just believable enough to work, though if I wanted to nitpick, I would have had a field day. However, if I did that, I would've missed out on entertaining scene after entertaining scene.

There were some problems, but overall they didn't really bother me. There were a couple of scenes where I had to ask myself, ""Why is this happening?"" There is an extended fight scene outside an airport that might have fit well in a Jackie Chan film from the seventies, but doesn't do much but show off some inventive fight choreography. Another sequence involving G.One being controlled by a video game controller might have set up an interesting possibility for the final battle, but is instead played just for laughs. Finally, a scene set up to sell an anti-smoking message is admirable, but hardly necessary.

Despite its few issues, this film was overflowing with invention and ideas and hopefully Bollywood can top it. If they can do this with a $30 million dollar budget, just imagine what they could do with even more. Though to be honest, I almost hope we never find out. Huge-budget ""family"" films like Transformers are so overblown, and so calculated to appeal to the lowest common denominator that they completely lack in heart or inspiration. Ra. One has both of these to spare.",1320969600,15,3246,4.74645390070922
4948528,3,B0063V696O,"Unabated enthusiasm accompanied by casual dismissals have gripped the Bollywood film industry for the last few weeks as RA.One began its promotional attyachar ( torture).  Supposedly one of the most expensive films made in India - ever, for a reported but not confirmed cost of 175 crores ( USD 40 million), making most of the money back it not really the aim of the film, I think although it has, even before the first show unveiled from the satellite, distribution, music and etc. rights. At stake is something even more than money that is the reputation and the shelf life of the multinational brand called SRK. The last few years have witnessed a lot of long dead competitors roaring back and vying for the supremacy only enjoyed for a brief period by King Khan. With SRK, more than anything is the reputation and box office dominance at stake.
RA.one is a decent watch, a  South Indian stereotype Shekhar (Shah Rukh Khan), his wife Sonia (Kareena Kapoor) and their son Prateek (Armaan Verma). Father SRK tries to hopelessly bond with his son and decides to design a virtual reality game with a hero as G.One and the villian RA.one. The game takes a life of its own as they step out of the game and battle it out in real life. Every plot line has been shamelessly borrowed from past science fiction movies, but the main theme of the villain trying to kill the child is Terminatoresque. There is plenty of added gimmicks such as cameos by Priyanka Chopra, Sanjay Dutt, Rajnikanth, Amitabh Bachchan's voice to make it an entertaining watch. The action scenes and the VFX, while not that great is still cutting edge for the Indian film Industry. I liked the confrontation between Ra.one and G.one is the car lot and the efforts of G.one to stop the runaway train. The songs are great and catch, especially Raftaarein, chammak challo, criminal and dildaara, I loved them all. SRK delivers partly on his promise this movie is entertaining but not a repeat watch. The pace is fast enough that I gazed on my watch only watch when it beeped, and realized that I was about 20 minutes away from the end. SRK acts fine but with a lot of cheese and some poorly written lines and stupidity- Come one SRK, who in the world eats Pasta with Yogurt. Kareena Kapoor and Arjun Rampul are efficient. Armann Verma as Prateek is the real star and truly shines brilliantly than the rest of the cast. Anubhav Sinha, is not a good director and has not salvaged his reputation, I wonder why in the world SRK chose him to helm this project. I hope he is not going to be back for the sequel.
RA.one is highly recommended for a one time watch, I watched it in 2D, but do not plan to watch in 3D. Enjoy with a pinch of salt. Three and half stars. 10/26/2011",1320883200,3,2731,4.526315789473684

I hated the old American song ""Stand by me"" in this new Indian movie (could be avoided easily). I think these elements make the movie look like a cheat even though there are a lot of originality, nice Indian music and good effects. I liked SRK as a blue eyed robot, he did very nice job.

The characters he portrays are fantastic because you can relate to them and to the situations that are plotted in these movies; and most times you also can a dose of wittiness.  I would recommend them as family entertainment.

It was funny and awesome! SRK with blue eyes?? *sigh* something to see! Sexy!

4948575,5,B0063V696O,"I really enjoyed this movie.  I especially enjoyed the special effects in the opening scenes of the story.  This is the second movie where I've seen Shahrukh play a character with a technical background (the other being a NASA scientist in ""Swades"") and he does a good job of representing a person with that type of knowledge.

I really liked his transition into G-One (the scene with the TSA-like agent at the London airport was hilarious!) and the fight sequence at the Mumbai Airport (what a great use of a soccer ball). Kareena Kapoor and Shahrukh make a fine married couple, although I liked her scenes with G-One best of all.  Arjun Rampal did a excellent job portraying Ra. One as the  villianous game character.  The two dance numbers is the film were great, especially the ""Criminal"" dance number with Shahrukh and Kareena dancing in a way not usually seen in Bollywood films.  Also the special effects in the train sequence were brilliantly done.

I also liked the Bonus Features Disc, particularly the Making of the Songs sequence with AKON and the writers composing the ""Chamak Challo"" song (and AKON learning Hindi).  I think all Bollywood films should come in a Multi-Disc format, so that you can see the behind the scenes activities (making of the songs, dance sequences, Stars Bio's, etc.).

4948581,3,B0063V696O,"This movie has received a lot of criticism for the plot, and to a degree I have to agree. If you can shut your brain off, and not ask why something happened that way, you will be able to enjoy it. Just don't expect ""science"" to have any place in in this ""science fiction"" movie. In fact, the level of intelligence in the movie is so obviously aimed at 10 year olds, that I'm really surprised by the racy, dirty elements of the movie. The song Criminal is so adult in nature, and so are a lot of the jokes. My kids would love this movie, but I can't let them watch it. Like, ever.
  On the other hand, the acting is superb. Srk is charming, once again in a dual role, especially as the computer program/superhero (remember to shut off your brain), who obviously has a special connection to the people around him. The other acting is good, too, but as usually Srk is the heart and soul of the movie. The action sequences were often a lot of fun, and some were obviously designed to show off. I mean, he runs along the SIDE of the train instead of on top of it. Cooler? Heck yeah, just not terribly practical, do you think? Oh wait, I turned my brain back on. Sorry.

By the end we were calling it ""Troninator: Enter the Matrix"").  The first few scenes are a little weird and silly, and like much Indian cinema there's a longer buildup to the action than most American audiences are used to, but if you're looking at this movie you're probably ready for that.  If you love Shah Rukh Khan, Superhero movies, and big action set pieces--and if you're willing to leave physics at the door--give this movie a try.",1377216000,,679,4.586776859504132

I am watching this and Totally love it, yes, it's still a Bollywood movie, so still expect some tacky, but the cinematography and sound effects etc. will keep you captivated. SK, still brings humor to the movie, being silly as usual. So far some of my fave. funny fighting scenes, I know right, funny fighting scenes? YES, this movie is quite humorous, anyway about the scenes. There is a scene when G.one is at the airport fighting and he is told ""no touching"" because he was throwing bad guys left and right, he lifts his feet to kick someone, and instead of kicking them ""touching"" the force of his kick emits this strong wind the the guys face, and hair is being blown all over, its hilarious, because we all know that does not happen. A cab driver in the parking lot, says "" very cool mam, a fan under his feet"". Yah, you need to watch it. My only dislike was the song Criminal, the video was too racy, something you would see on a rap video with women shaking their half dressed backside in-front of the camera. Akon did a good job singing Chammak Challo, which is the reason I decided to watch this movie anyway, I stumbled upon the song on youtube, and Akon for that matter afterwards. Had no idea who he was and that a black guy sang it.

4948601,3,B0063V696O,"For anyone who knows a few things about Indian films, the story of ""Ra. One"" comes as no surprise. The sci-fi adventure film revolves around a genius game creator Shekhar Subramaniam (Shah Rukh Khan), whose brand new game features an invincible antagonist ""Ra. One"" (short for Random Access Version One, also a reference to Ramayana). Shekhar's son Prateek (Armaan Verma) is allowed to play the game, but the supervillain ""Ra. One"" comes out of the game, determined to finish the life-or-death game in real world. And the game's superhero ""G. One"" is the only one who can beat ""Ra. One.""

""Ra. One"" has action, musical (including songs by Akon), and comedy all rolled in one. The story is weak and direction is uneven, but the film has a few surprises up in its sleeve, including a cameo from the star of ""Enthiran,"" another sci-fi themed action adventure. The film may be categorized into the ""superhero movie"" genre, but ""Ra. One,"" which looks like a mixture of ""T2"" and ""TRON,"" is no family-oriented picture, with some characters killed in a pretty violent manner.

The best part of the film is the action sequences, a car chase in London streets and a runaway train in Mumbai (with special effects supervised by Jeffrey Kleiser, computer production supervisor of ""TRON""). Dance sections are very good, but they are few and far between. At 156 minutes, ""Ra. One"" is short for an Indian film. (Probably this is because the film was made with a 3D release in mind.

""Ra. One"" is a hodge-podge of entertainment and styles. Some part of it is really thrilling while others are just boring. Don't expect too much, and you won't be disappointed.",1356307200,3,1642,4.795053003533569

There are some great references to Hindu legends, particularly the Ramayana. But besides the fact that I adore SRK, the special effects are very very good.

4948618,2,B0063V696O,"I REALLY wanted to like this movie.  The musical numbers on You Tube looked so promising.  And once I got the movie, the special effects were very impressive.

BUT...

The plot was one of the WORST I have ever seen.

First, the premise of the movie is the dad is a video game programmer, and the mom is a writer.  The son disrespects the dad because he is a huge nerd and somewhat of a coward.  So the dad, to impress his son (the son idolizes bad guys and villains) invents a video game with the worst villain of all time.  My first problem with the plot is this:  the video game the dad invents would not entertain anyone.  Got to be the worst video game design of all time.  But the son is sufficiently impressed.

To move on with the plot:  the son MUST PLAY THIS GAME, IMMEDIATELY, of course.  So while the rest of the dad's office parties to celebrate the impending release, the son plays the game.  Second bad plot point:  when the son is made to quit the game, the villain of the game gets so angry that he ""breaks out"" of the game to go after the kid in real life.  Uh, what?  Yah, you heard me.  A lot of fake-y science terms are knocked around, a lot of wires are stripped and equipment broken, whatever.

Third really bad plot point:  the video game villain actually can KILL people in the real world.  How is that possible?

I could go on, but no, think I'll pass.  There is a very good Western-movie style car chase, and some very good special effects.  And the musical numbers are mostly good, especially the songs by Akon (Criminal, Chammak Challo).  But really, REALLY sad plot.  I will NOT be keeping this movie in my Bollywood collection!",1330214400,9,1657,4.312703583061889
4948619,5,B0063V696O,"I'm only commenting on the blu-ray transfer of Ra. One. Personally, I love the movie, so I'm not going to go into any review on what I loved about it. It's been said better by others here, and I just ignore the closed-minded haters because they don't grasp the importance of this movie to the Indian film industry as a whole.

The Indian film industry has been slow to release films to blu-ray, mostly because the technology seems to be slow in catching on in India, and the films are more expensive to buy. Also, the blu-rays never contain additional features that are available on the regular DVDs, which is annoying. Those of us who love a particular movie find ourselves having to buy 2 copies in 2 formats just so we can have the extras (deleted scenes, featurettes, etc.).

In some cases, as with this one, the quality of the transfer isn't as good as it should be. Actually, I was a little dismayed at the quality of the transfer of the regular DVD of Ra. One, so I had hopes that the blu-ray of Ra. One would be crisper. It's not, for some really odd reason. So in the case of this particular film, if you loved the movie, stick to the regular DVD because I didn't see any visual improvement of the blu-ray over it.

I give 5 stars for the film as a whole, but 3 for the blu-ray transfer.",1328918400,,1296,4.30327868852459

4948621,4,B0063V696O,"RA-One is not mind-blowing but still its good enough and not as good as Rajnikant's ""Robot"" who does a special appearance here. Though Kareena Kapoor looks fabulous here after her dismal performance in ""Bodyguard"".This is her second Diwali hit last year she gave os ""Golmaal 3"".The child actor who plays Shahrukh's son is not much good could have cast his own son Aryan here.

It starts with cheap double meaning humour. With Shahrukh fighting three Chinese Girls named ""Iski Lee"" ,""Uski Lee"" and ""Sabki Lee"".Also funny is the special appearance of Sanjay Dutt. At dinner table Shahrukh who is a Tamil here eats noodles with curd. Power Yoga and Satish Shah bit too is funny. This humour does reminds me of Jeetendra's humour in 80's South hindi flicks with Sri Devi and Jaya Prada. The villain bit may remind you of Terminator,some starting action scenes make it look like Spiderman. Shahrukh's antics in Train sequence is also similar to""Robot"".

This is director Anubhav Sinha's first release after ""Cash"" in 2007. And like ""Tum Bin"" his first directorial venture here too the lead actor Shahrukh dies in the beginning at the hands on RA-one. Vishal Shekhar's music is quite good three songs( Chammak Challo,Bhare Naina & Dildaara)are nice. Though in climax scene music is cliched. Dalip Tahil Shahrukh's co-star from ""Baazigar"" is here too as the head of his company. Arjun Rampal's role is quite short and he comes in the second half only. Kareena looks great in the negative bit where RA-one changes himself to her form also he mentally manipulates her to speed crash a train.

Shahrukh develops a video game where villain would  never loose. The villain RA-one comes out of the video game to search for his son when he leaves the game in middle. It kills Shahrukh. His female colleague brings G-one out from the video game who tries to save Kareena his wife and son. The train crash scene is done well where the train crashes into Mumbai Central Railway Station and blows it to pieces. Definitely a first of its kind. I saw it in 2D at PVR but advise you people to see it in 3D many scenes do seem to be crafted for 3D experience. I would certainly go and see it in 3D next week.

Its a good movie but not mind-blowing or even like ""Robot"".Think video-games would be in market soon and kids would make it a hit. Seems to be made for them in mind.",1327968000,,2353,4.646634615384615

The message it tries to convey about family bonding and values is simply beautiful. It's what King Khan himself believes in.
The character Ra. One was so effectively creepy and scary..just listening to the background music used for most of his scenes now freaks me out!

My only complaint: some cheap humor was used that should've been edited out to make the perfect masterpiece.

4948623,4,B0063V696O,"RA-ONE's rep for being the most expensive Indian movie to date could get a shellacking should PRINCE VAALI ever see the light of day. Both RA-ONE and PRINCE VAALI are superhero films, but until PRINCE VAALI actually hits the theater, I'm espousing&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Krrish/dp/B000HDZ96U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Krrish</a>&nbsp;as THE best Indian superhero film, of which upcoming sequel I cannot wait. RA-ONE? It's okay. It's not as awful as, say, that short film FIREMAN (which you can check out on YouTube, except why would you?). Heck,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-India/dp/B0016GOO8G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. India</a>, a 1987 film about a guy who can turn invisible, was more entertaining (and MR. INDIA is supposed to be getting a sequel, too).

RA-ONE, at its heart, centers around a father-son relationship. International superstar Shah Rukh Khan takes on three roles: as the nerdy but kind-hearted (and ridiculously goofy haired) Shekhar, as the dream sequence hero Lucifer, and as G-One. Shekhar is a video game designer toiling for the massive London-based Barron Industries. In an effort to connect with his bratty son Prateek - and because Prateek believes that villains are cool - Shekhar creates a virtual reality game in which the super-villain, Ra-One (for ""Random Access, Version One""), never loses.

Ra-One (the name is pronounced like the demon ""Raavan"") is a synthesis of history's ten most evil men. Opposing him in the game is the superhero G-One, and it's reputed that Ra-One is so mighty and invincible that G-One's chances of besting him stand at a mere 0.01%. Those who've seen the techno-thriller VIRTUOSITY can already suss out what comes next. In a world in which video game designers play god and weird science is introduced, reality and fantasy sometimes get to blurring and sentience is implausibly achieved. When a kid plays the game and threatens to beat Ra-One, is it a real stretch that Ra-One becomes so incensed that he pursues the kid out into the real world? And Ra-One out in the real world is as homicidal as Sid 6.7. ""Jackie Chan"" doesn't stand a chance.

RA-ONE, running at two and a half hours, borrows, begs, and steals from previous Hollywood films. It's a mash-up of TERMINATOR 2 and THE MATRIX and VIRTUOSITY and who knows what else. It even lifts that old martial arts move in which the hero uses the girl as a fight prop. Also regurgitated is the bit in which a gouged-out eyeball is employed to gain access thru a retinal-scanned security portal. I will say that I enjoyed the big-budget action sequences, even when they bear a striking familiarity and you can see where the wire work went in. I love the runaway train sequence! G-One and Ra-One look very cool visually, both Shah Rukh and Arjun Rampal obviously having done their reps in the gym. Shah Rukh's blue contacts are pretty effective.

There's a jarring element here, in that the film tends to shift from a cornball, comic family film to a more intense action thriller. It's hard to reconcile a goofball scene like Shekhar's getting mugged by a midget or Shah Rukh's Michael Jackson impression with Ra-One's casually brutal elimination of that old Chinese woman. I know this is the sort of masala that Bollywood tends to offer its audience. But, given its budget and its ambitions, RA-ONE should've maybe toned down the silly. KRRISH did, and was all the better for it.

What else? If you're a fan of Bollywood cinema, you may get a kick out of the opening sequence which features cameos by Priyanka Chopra (as Desi Girl) and Sanjay Dutt as the dream villain. The musical numbers are catchy and work to advance the plot. There are three really catchy tunes: ""Dildaara (Stand By Me),"" ""Criminal,"" and ""Chammak Challo."" The startling thing is that Akon worked on the last two songs. In a bit of awesome, in the irresistible, percussion-heavy ""Chammak Challo,"" Akon sings in flawless Hindi, having picked up the words phonetically. If you can spare two and a half hours, RA-ONE is worth a peek, if only to see how Indian cinema is striving to catch up to Hollywood. RA-ONE exhibits pretty decent f/x and nice performances by Shah Rukh, Kareena Kapoor (as Shekhar's understanding wife Sonia), and Arjun Rampal (who is properly sinister and gleefully takes on those villainy poses). Man, if only the filmmakers had managed to calm down those cheesy Bollywood excesses. Wherever Hrithik Roshan is right now, I don't think he feels at all threatened, especially since the KRRISH sequel is almost here. 3 stars out of 5 for RA-ONE. Maybe an extra half-star for the sheer effort and energy expended by the cast & crew in this project. Shah Rukh said RA-ONE took up several years of his life.

Disc 1 has the feature presentation with the option of an English or Arabic sub-title and the option to listen either in the Hindi, Telugu, or Tamil language. There is also an option for song selection so you can click on the banging ""Chmmak Challo"" joint. Disc 2 contains the following bonus stuff (with no English sub-titles, although people speak often enough in English that you can sort of follow along):

- 5 Deleted Scenes (totaling 00:05:30 minutes)
- Making of the Film (00:32:10 minutes)
- Making of Songs - Behind the Scenes of the musical numbers ""Chammak Challo"" and ""Criminal,"" interspersed with Akon in the recording studio collaborating with the music composing/directing duo Vishal and Shekhar (00:19:08)
- RA-ONE London Premiere - focusing mostly on the cast's red carpet walks (00:07:51)
- RA-ONE Trailer Launch (00:04:26)",1326758400,7,5654,5.112554112554113

Shah Rukh along with his VFX company and many other people associated with it have done so much for this film which makes it a wonderful experience. There are so many things that one can talk about that went into making this film. It is an extraordinary experience.
It talks about a super hero with a heart. Everyone has acted out so wonderfully in the film.
They have even printed out the locations where the film was shot at. The train station portions were a complete excellent action sequence. great achievements, great aims.. par excellence
One has to watch the film a few times so as not to miss out any small detail of it. I have to go see it again to remember everything.
Ebay has the 2 DVD -original version of the film's release.
I really like the thought process, the story behind this film. It is simple.
The first Indian film that was advertised so uniquely & differently across the world because it was a new concept. It was so expensive and had plenty of computer graphics... technology ..VFX and so on ..invested into building this film.
I truly enjoyed the experience of seeing this film.
I love Shah Rukh.. bow down to his work.. a good man!",1325462400,4,1217,4.461883408071749

4948626,5,B0063V696O,"This film is way different from what Bollywood usually does. The film has used the Hollywood effects in special fields, I would rather buy it's BluRay then DVD because it has to be watched either on Screen or on BluRay format !",1322697600,2,227,4.428571428571429
4948627,4,B0063V696O,"I watched the movie twice, once in 2D and once in 3D (imo, the 3D experience is fantastic). And I enjoyed the movie, as a whole. Some critics rip this movie apart for its poor script, but one must bear in mind the target audience is essentially kids so the plot is simple and straight-forward. Some has also criticize the use of low comedy (the groin-thingy, the airport officer ogling over G.One's piercings) but from what I noticed, the audience takes no offense and just laugh it off, even the kids (although the significance of the airport scene might not dawn on them). As for the sci-fi bit as to how the game characters can come alive, yes, it might be flawed but hey, if we can accept the fact that a bite from a radioactive spider can turn one into Spiderman, or that exposure to a gamma bomb could turn one into The Hulk, why the need to nitpick?

The thing is, the makers of Ra. One didn't set out to make this into an intelligent, gritty flick. It is meant to be an entertainer, and most importantly, to showcase the technology that was once regarded to be a Hollywood exclusive feature. With Ra. One, the aim is to create a superhero that would appeal to Indian children and to show the world stunning visual effects could be achieved at a fraction of the Hollywood price tag. I'd say the team is successful on those two fronts.

The plot is simple. A dad, eager to win his son's affection, creates a game where the villain (Ra. One) is stronger than the hero (G.One). Son is happy and gets to play the game, but when he stops the game at Level 2, Ra. One is angry because no one is supposed to defeat him. So he vows to track the boy down and comes to life. The boy and his mum are forced to flee, but not before G.One is also brought to life to defend them.

Shah Rukh Khan (SRK) plays dual roles, that of the dad, Shekhar Subramaniam, and the superhero, G.One. As the dad, SRK plays Shekhar the way the script demands perfectly - clumsy, endearing, an embarrassment to the son, but when the situation calls for it, is perfectly responsible and heroic. Some say SRK is over-acting as Shekhar but personally, I feel to bring Shekhar to life and to make him a stark contrast to the stoic G.One, SRK had to be ridiculously funny and silly, and in that aspect, he succeeds brilliantly, imo. As the superhero G.One, SRK manages to be mostly stoic with monotous speech pattern, and his posture is impeccable (straight back, restrained gait/movements) though I have to admit it is a little jarring to see G.One smile and groove in one of the song items, Chammak Challo.

Kareena Kapoor as Shekhar's wife is beautiful, and though there isn't much scope for her to display her histrionic, she is absolutely brilliant in the scenes following her husband's death and when she is Ra. One is disguise.

And the little boy who plays the son, Prateek a.k.a Lucifer (his game handle) is truly a wonderful child actor who displays ease and confidence in all of his scenes.

The action scenes are brilliantly shot and look almost flawless, and the visual effects are really quite top-notch quality (nothing as epic as Transformers, of course). I seriously love the train sequence where SRK as G.One flies/runs from/across carriage door to carriage door. Look at the way SRK brilliantly holds his posture in which the action looks real that you forget he is aided by wires.

If I need to complaint about one thing, it is the number of scantily-clad dancers in the song items Criminal and Chammak Challo. Why the need to show so much skin?

All in all, this movie is massively entertaining. You have drama, action, comedy, bit of romance all rolled into one. It is also a game changer for Hindi cinema due to the visual effects and technology employed - proof that Hindi films can retain its desi core and still stand on an international platform.",1322006400,48,3842,4.517985611510792
4948628,4,B0063V696O,"I awaited this 'superhero' film that SRK wanted to do for his son--and almost didn't get to see it in the theatre. Well, it sure was much more than what I expected. Not only did you get traditional Bollywood/Indian morals(the fight to keep Ravaan{Ra. One} from taking over the world, but the action and fun!
Pure escapism and wonderful fun--if you are familiar with Bollywood--you will get the many references to Bollywood hits(and SRK films)if you aren't just sit back and enjoy the fun!
