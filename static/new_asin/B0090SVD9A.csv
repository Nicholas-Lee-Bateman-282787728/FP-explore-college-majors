5215751,3,B0090SVD9A,"I really, really, really wanted this to be 5 stars and more.  What you get in this collection is other releases (which are sold separately here on Amazon), combined into one collection.

First, let me say this, I got this set during the lightning deals around Christmas, and for that price, the collection is worth it.  It's listed at just under $200, and for that price you would be better off buying the parts individually. (I paid less than half that)

In the box comes:
The Best of The Dean Martin Variety Show (Collector's Edition) (6 Disk Set)
The King of Cool: Best of Dean Martin Variety Show (Collector's Edition) (6 Disk set)
Dean Martin Christmas (Single Disk)
Dean Martin Variety Show Uncut (3 Disk Set)

Now, you can go find each of those items as they are all sold individually.  And, when you add them up, you can see what the ""right price"" for this collection should be.

Along with many other reviewers for the individual items, I thought these would be complete shows.  I have not been through all the disks yet, but as others have pointed out, the two 6 disk collections are just partial shows.  The Christmas one I have not yet viewed, and the Uncut 3 disk version sounds like the only ""5 star"" disks of the group.

Here is the worst part, as many others have said.  The best of Dean, in my opinion, his musical numbers, have actually for the most part been removed.  All of the songs from the couch are omitted (which are simply beautiful and can be found on YouTube on occasion).

What also is really infuriating is they show the closing credits, which roll over still shots of the complete episode.  So, you can see all of the parts they deleted in these collections !  For example they might have 25 minutes of a full 50 minute show, but the closing credits will show snapshots of scenes that are not on these disks and you find youself saying aloud ""Hey I don't remember seeing that"" or ""Oh shoot, that clip looks like it could have been funny"".

One episode in particular gets me ticked because they show the ""Ken Lane Spot"" where Dean performs on the couch...right up until he is supposed to sing, then they cut it. (he sings ""Welcome to My world"", you can find it on Youtube)

All in all, it's a very good collection that could have been so very much more.  Based on my own opinion and other reviews, if you are looking for complete episodes, skip this set and buy the 3 disk Uncut set sold separately.  I'm saving viewing those 3 disks of this collection for last, as I have a feeling they will be by far the best ones.",1357084800,53,2548,4.405982905982906

and his show was wonderful.",1356825600,,103,4.2
5215753,5,B0090SVD9A,"This show was brilliant. Dean Martin is hilarious and fun to watch in every monologue, sketch and musical number. I highly recommend this to anyone that wants to see a funny variety show filled with classic guest stars and celebrities.",1356825600,,235,4.9

5215755,5,B0090SVD9A,Have enjoyed going back and watching these episodes. Brings back such memories of celebrities who were so talented but are no longer with us.,1356480000,,141,4.916666666666667
5215756,5,B0090SVD9A,Came on time. Book was a super surprise & a good read. No problems or concern with DVD's. A laugh a minute. Great entertainment.,1356393600,,128,4.375
5215757,1,B0090SVD9A,"Lets start off by saying I love Deans Shows even though I was not old enough to see it in its initial run on NBC.These reviews are nice but no one has said if these are the complete episode from beginning to end. I keep seeing the best of the Dean martin Show. No one wants to see snippets or musical acts cut. If Time Life is listening take a cue from MPI Video who just released The Dark Shadows Complete Set.
Ifg Time Life is going to step up to the plate and do dean Martin Justice then lets put these shows in their entirety with all the music acts intact,If not you cant say that this is a fantastic Dean martin set. What Time life has done is released sets and had the public buy them now their releasing these same sets in a complete collection....Sad that someone can not step up to the plate and get deans television series released in a season 1,2,3,4 etc.sets just like smallville and other shows. SAD SAD SAD.And by the way why can NBC release the dean Martin Roasts in there entirety to...",1353715200,23,1003,4.229166666666667
5215758,5,B0090SVD9A,"It just keeps getting better!

Since Time-Life stepped up to the plate, we have been fortunate enough to have a treasure-trove of material from TV's Dean Martin Show released from the archives! Now Time-Life is amassing their past three DVD box sets (""The Best of..."", ""King of Cool"" and ""Dean Uncut"") into one huge ""Ultimate"" set to bring us 17 hours of material all under one package with a few bonuses thrown in...

As a former TV executive and founder of The Dean Martin Fan Center (you can find us on the Web), we produced a lot of TV shows back in those years, but the one show that had captured my heart and I spent my youth on, is Dean Martin's Variety Show. Watching these Time-Life DVD's takes me right back to Studio 4 in Burbank as if it were yesterday. If you're old enough to remember, I don't even have to explain, but if you've only heard about those years, all I can say is that it was a magical time

Included in the Ultimate set is the never re-released The Dean Martin Show ""Christmas"" episode from December 19, 1968 (with Dom DeLuise and The Golddiggers). What a treat in itself! Also included is a disc of episodes that was only available at Cosco stores last year, but now included to give everyone a chance to have and own.

I am glad to have had the chance to be a small part of this re-release, and I'm happy that my good friend, Lee Hale (Special Materials Person and Musical Director on the original Dean Martin Shows) had a larger hand in keeping these releases with the same look and feel as they did when aired originally.

Listen... honesty... the price may seem a little steep, but it is well worth the enjoyment you'll get from trying to straighten the smile off your face the next day! If you're still having a hard time deciding... try looking at some clips of Dean's show that people have put on YouTube, then get this set to watch it on your large screen TV!",1346976000,21,1896,4.375
