And I was so glad to find it for A.) a great price and B.) in excellent condition! It's a concert I remember watching over and over from my childhood and after losing it years ago I thought all hope was lost of ever finding it on Tape again, as well as ever seeing it. Watching it when it was delivered brought back so many memories and I was amazed I still knew the words to the songs haha!",1254441600,5,516,3.9711538461538463

In truth, if you really want to watch a good TMNT live action movie go find the 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. I thought those turtles looked more real than the ones in this film.

They have more personality, you can tell the difference between each turtle, it's cool. That's what I'm here for, character development for the turtles. Also shouldn't the turtles look as realistic as possible? I mean that's sort of the point, people would be complaining if the looked fake.

6319551,5,B00J2T18XS,"well, as some have stated, the movie isn't as good as the originals (or the  series) and i hated the origin story they gave the turtles. the one from the original cartoon in the early 90's was better and more plausible. with that said if you take the movie here as well as out of the shadows and watch them not expecting it to be like the original cartoon or movies, then this is decent. i didn't like the turtles, either they look like mutated steroid freaks. but i got used to it and now it's pretty cool.

as far as this gift set goes it is awesome. it comes with a 3 disc copy of the movie in 3D (BUT t's useless unless you have blue ray and a 3D tv( the second disc is the one with the special features and blue ray movie on it and the last disc is the movie on regular DVD + plus a digital copy and the action figure of raph looks awesome sitting on my computer desk. and if you do buy the edition with the raph figure don't expect some tiny little 3MM figure it is approx 7in tall and 6 or so inches wide and has the look of raph from the new turtles movie in a combat stance.",1500422400,,1083,3.918181818181818

6319558,5,B00J2T18XS,An outstanding movie I love both of them but you can't beat retro turtles like these companies are doing like the cartoons for example.  The digital copy worked perfectly just gotta make sure you have the right HDMI cable connected.  I would recommend this to anyone but if your getting DVD's amazon.com or else where make sure it's new not used in anyway to avoid the possibility of getting the digital code ripped off from you.  I now own both of the most recent release of the mutant turtles.  I would purchase from this company again in the future. thanks very much,1495065600,,569,4.549019607843137

6319573,1,B00J2T18XS,"I am a die-hard Ninja Turtles fan. I love their video-games, I love the 2003 cartoon with all my heart. I think that cartoon is actually the best out of everything the turtles had and I've actually been rewatching it now as an adult and it still provides a great story, acting and just stands up very-very well. But I am here to talk about this 2014 movie, right?
It's not bad. I mean, it's an okay movie that some of you, guys, can watch with friends and such, but it's nothing more. There is 0 to think about, there is 0 interesting characters or character development for anybody that is not laughable. Basically, if you want me to make it short, hear this: Turtles are kids of Batman and She-Hulk, April is a sexy chick, her co-worker is dumb, Shredder is a Transformer. Add some explosions, some generic orchestra, some ""sexy chick"" jokes and more or less bearable fight scenes. There you have it, that's your movie.
Now, the actors are okay - and that's it. They are not good or bad, they are just okay. Don't expect anything catchy or performance-worthy. It's just alright. I do have some complaints about turtles' voices. If you are like me and remember those great actors from 2003 cartoon - you are going to be pissed the hell of. Leo does not sound like a leader, Mikey sounds like he is from ghetto, Raph sounds pretty much like Leo, not grumpy at all, Donattelo is nothing different. Is this so hard to find memorable voices for turtles? They are the stars here, what the hell? Instead, they sound like your regular neighbours. Also that Sacks (sorry if I wrote it wrong) scientist-guy... oh boy, you could kinda see that he tried to make a good villain, a bearable villain, he tried, but some of the lines were just so damn stupid! What, his motives are to become ""Stupid rich""? The hell? Also another ""villain"" - Shredder. Despite the fact that he is a transformer, he also says some of the dumbest villain-stuff I've ever heard. ""Take innocent people as a bait"". What kind of a villain would admit that he takes innocent people? This is just bad writing, horrible writing. Shredder would never say that.

And I've touched the writing aspect, so I'll go into this in a moment. April is dumb. What, she really thought that someone would believe her story without anything to prove it with? More than that, someone would publish it on news? The hell? Her co-worker is even dumber. It's like he had stopped growing up at, say, 13-14 years old and stayed there. All he cares about is to dive into April's butt. I mean, sure, some people care about sex more than others, but like THIS? It's just stupid.
The story... there was none. April discovers Turtles, bad guys kill Splinter, Turtles fight with them. There's not even that much of a dialogue going on between them. Again, if you take a look at 2003's cartoon, you will see that it has actually had a lot of character development, multiple story-lines, its own unique characters, cool dialogue, nice jokes or even something to think about. What do you have here? Co-worker of April joking about her butt, while she takes photos. Great.
To the good stuff. Some of the fight scenes were pretty bearable, turtles' design is great and the CGI is pretty good on them. I really like the design of these Turtles. It has a very unique feel to it, it suits their characters and looks very-very nice. But that's about it. There was nothing more for me to like.

A disappointment. I don't know how else to name this movie. And I also sorry for those people that will have this as their first Turtle movie. It's just a generic shoot-all and blow-all type of deal. I hope there is a better future for my favorite Turtles.",1492214400,5,3673,4.521804511278195

6319642,3,B00J2T18XS,"The original TMNT (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles) was better in my opinion.  The story line was better the acting was better.  By the way it was not that the actors in this film were bad it was the direction and production that left them with a flat performance.  The original TMNT used Muppet type costumes and gave the actors a greater range of expression, emotion and a more life like feel.  This movie failed because of the technology.  They depended too much on the technology and left out the importance of a good story well told. The need for the actors to really feel their parts.  I felt like the actors were not given direction or made to do several takes with different emotion and dynamics so that the best could be used and cut into the scenes so that there was a proper feel of energy at the proper time.  The industry has forgotten that the story is more important than the technology.  It is ruining the art of entertainment.",1486080000,,940,4.456140350877193

The main negative is the nonsensical story and alternative origin story that's just beyond stupid. So we are to believe that her dad was killed in a fire but then the main villain claims he shot him? Which is it. Get your story straight. Not only that but splinter and the turtles apparently could understand English and comprehend plans while they were still a rat and four box turtles in cages? It makes no sense. April is the one who puts them in the sewer and thats how she knows who they are when she hears their names? Okaaaaaayyyy.....

Yes, 4 stars. That is correct.
But let me be clear, this is NOT a good movie.
This is a solid 4-star movie simply for its nostalgia and hilarity factors. The songs are terrible, the acting horrendous, the product placement appalling...

I knew that going in, so I knew better than to take it seriously. And I promise you if you go into it with a similar mindset you will laugh your ass off the entire time just like I did.",1484179200,,505,4.206185567010309

6319866,2,B00J2T18XS,This movie looks like it was made to focus on 3D action rather than any actual story.  Will Arnett was the only actor I liked in this movie. I did like Megan Fox in transformers but her acting in this movie was terrible I find her annoying and hard to watch. William Fichtner (Eric sacks) is usually a great villain but in this movie he is also terrible.  I don't believe any of their backstories these characters have no depth.  Can it be blamed on a horrible script or poor direction? Maybe.  Examples of bad writing/direction begin in the first few minutes.  Your telling me a reporter would interupt a conversation in which she was about to break open a story to walk over to her camera guy after he yells at her they are going to be late.  It's no wonder she has never been able to get a good story.  The scene where she is supposed to have stayed up all night can only be described as awkward.  I was really disappointed in what could have been a great movie.  If you are looking for action there is an avalanche of great scenes.  For the record I am a huge tmnt fan and have accepted multiple different origins and story lines.  Also it took my kids a while to want to watch this because they didn't particularly like the look of the turtles they are also huge tmnt fans.,1483315200,,1278,4.261410788381743

So when I first saw the trailer I was kind of upset with how the turtles looked. But I had to see it on principle. It exceeded my expectations and turned out to be a really good movie. Not like the original so much but let's face it, one of the things that movies like this do, is rewrite their story. And this one was good plus there were aspects of the cartoon included as well.

6320082,3,B00J2T18XS,"I personally love the ninja turtles! But this movie was kind of a let down...
1. Megan Fox can not act.
2. Shredder looked too much like a Decepticon from Transformers.
3. The movie jumped from place to place too much and too fast.
4. The movie's pace was too fast at times.
5. They left Hamato Yoshi completely out of the story.

What I liked was:
1. The CGI turtles looked amazing!
2. The action sequences (including the battles) were awesome!
3. The basic plot of the movie was good.

Overall; Micheal Bay and the rest of the production crew kinda messed up our
'heroes-in-a-half shell' a little too much. I was a little let down in the end...
My grade: C+ or two-and a half stars.",1480723200,,684,4.3359375

6320140,4,B00J2T18XS,"Ok i'm not going to insult your intelligence and say that this is Oscar caliber work here. If you are a serious movie-goer...you will find this movie painfully stupid. If you are someone who grew up with the Ninja Turtles back in the 80s and 90s and have been waiting for a live action adaptation that makes silly nods to the source material (i.e. use of the word Cowabunga, references to Pizza infatuation, the turtle's unique personalities i.e. goofball, tough guy, leader and nerd), then you'll enjoy this film. There isn't much story here, and the movie feels a bit short, but honestly if you're watching this its to watch the Ninja Turtles kick some butt and crack a few jokes here and there. Again some elements are just silly, and Megan Fox isn't the best pick for April O'Niel, but when it comes down to it I enjoyed the movie for what it was. If you like explosions, CGI fight scenes, and Michael Bay's live action adaptations of 80s and 90s cartoons then you'll feel right at home here.",1479168000,2,996,4.538888888888889

6320279,2,B00J2T18XS,This is the worst turtles movie I have seen. I only give it 2 stars because of the animation all the other stars are lost because of the horrible plot. Here is and example at one point they're at a mansion on a mountain outside the NYC. The fight seen leaving said house was fought sliding down the mountain for what seemed to last for 20 minutes. After all that time you would have thought it ends at the bottom of the mountain but no it ends on a massive cliff.  The mountain out side the whole city was so huge its like they were sliding down the Himalayas. Also the Shredder suit is ridiculous and the last fight ends somewhat anticlimactic.,1477440000,,645,4.286885245901639

Very well done. I found the turtles likeable and would watch it again. As a dad, I found it family appropriate. Very little inappropriate language compared to most movies; nothing harsh. Kid friendly. Will watch the second one now. Found no stupid political agenda or inappropriate hidden meaning in this movie. The moral was: Always take care of family.

My four year old and I enjoyed watching it together, and it was good enough that we both wanted to watch the sequel.  Despite some mildly inappropriate language (similar to what you might hear on TV) it was appropriate for the ten and under crowd.  The movie seemed to be geared for that age group.  Slightly younger audience then the Avengers, but still watchable for adults.  Definitely not a movie my wife and I would watch together.",1475971200,,546,4.76595744680851

For kids who never read a comic book or were ever exposed to better iterations of the franchise, this might be a pretty good action flick. Also, the acting was pretty terrible. I expected hot garbage from Megan Fox but the caliber of performance from William Fichtner and Will Arnett was significantly worse than their abilities based on evidence from previous works.

There's barely any plot.  Even the action scenes and special effects are very ordinary.  It's just flat out lazy - you can tell those who made it didn't care and didn't make any effort.

However the action was top notch even some of the acting was good, Will Arnett and Megan fox did good and funny parts. The Shredder... While I believe this is the way he should have always been..  There was hardly a need to cgi the character, mayor plot hole here, we see shredder without his suit able to break 2 inch ropes and single handledy kill a guy while still tied up...

6320727,1,B00J2T18XS,"Growing up on TMNT made this a painful movie to watch. Megan Fox's character was shallow and 1 dimensional, unable to save the poor writing and atrocious character development. Of the 4 turtles, Raphael's character was the most fleshed out, with Donatello  and Leonardo as well developed and scripted as a set of store mannequins. Michelangelo's transformation from California-surfer-dude in the original series to an embarrassingly mentally handicapped character was annoying to watch and never explained.  Is his lack of mental faculties due to an injury? Lobotomy? Too much meth?  I really wish I could get a refund on the time I spent watching this.",1472947200,,653,5.2

The character Vern, seemed too illogical to have a good actor like Will Arnett to be playing. April's relationship didn't appear to develop enough to show that they ""were like family"". The movie seemed to jump right in to ""hey you know what the ninja turtles are all about, so there is no need for explanation!""

I was impressed with the story line it was similar to the first movie but went into more detail the background of the turtles. The graphics are better. The only thing is the turtles were immensely bulkier than original movie. The turtles still had the same personalities. Good family movie,1471824000,,454,4.416666666666667

The dialogue for the turtles does a great job with their individual personalities and characters. Once when I was drinking and watching this movie Raphaels dialogue at the end honestly made my eyes water. I was really drunk though...
Point is, if you read any of the comics and watch any of the shows the turtles themselves will not disappoint you.
I particularly like the singing in the elevator part and the part where Donnie tells Raph to ""let him be the badass for once"".
As a whole, not a good movie, but if you like the turtles in other media then you will laugh at least once at their dialogue.",1471132800,,723,4.323529411764706

If you're looking for a movie that does justice to the TMNT legacy, then avoid this movie like the plague. It bastardizes most of the actual storyline, Megan Fox is atrocious, the origin story wasn't clever or original, it was poorly written, fleshed out and implemented by literal baboons at typewriters.",1471132800,,556,4.914893617021277

The story deviates a little from the origin story from the classic cartoons, but that's actually nice to see they attempted to be at least a little original.

I do not feel that Megan Fox was the right person to put into the movie because one she did not fit the description and two she is not the best actress out there by all means.  Honestly I believe that the cast makes a big impact on how the movie is and how much I liked it.

I was shocked just now to see that the female lead was Megan Fox. She's really changed; not sure what to say about that. This is obviously a movie that targets an audience of mostly children. I thought that some of the language in the movie was very inappropriate but most of what comes out of Hollywood these days seems to not show any type of moral countenance for children audiences. I've seen the same thing with even Disney; not really a surprise seeing the path they are going down. I'm sure if it was possible, Walt Disney is flipping over in this coffin and ashamed of what the powers that be have done to his family oriented company. I digress. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was entertaining, I wouldn't go out of my way to watch it again but this is just my opinion. I would recommend parents watch it first to decide if the small amount of inappropriate language in the show is okay for their children or if it would even register.",1469059200,,1058,4.430769230769231

I didn't enjoy the look of Shredder though.  To much going on with his armor, and he could have used more screen time as well.  Great to have Vern and (Mr.) Burns in this.  I of course liked it enough to have to buy it and add it to my collection of TMNT movies.  Of which I do not have the third time travel movie on my shelf (just a vhs recording).

For a kids movie, the underlying plot was a little ridiculous - huge multinational company engineering disaster for profit is too heady and convoluted for children - and the entire film is a substantially worse movie than the 1987 classic - which, here, says something about modern film making in general.

Also, I thought the CGI turtles were pretty bad compared the actors in suits in the original films.  Not sure how they pulled that off.",1467676800,,454,4.794871794871795

About 15 minutes in you realize that the miscasting of Megan Fox as April O'Neil is the least of this film's problems. Perhaps small children will enjoy this film because they have no reference point for the original series, but even then I give pause. Why? This movie is somewhat inappropriate for small children. Will Arnett's character Vernon's only role seems to be to ogle and make sexual remarks about April O'Neill. I haven't seen the sequel yet, but I only hope he has a reduced role with the introduction of Casey Jones. Hopefully the sequel gets an extra dose of Turtle Power because this film was lacking.",1467417600,,712,4.704

The turtles had a lot of fun lines and they seemed to be mostly true to the characters. Megan Fox did fine in her role... if I didn't think of her as April O'Neil. In other words, her acting was good and the character fit the story, she just didn't resemble the April that I know at all. Also it kind of bugged me that [SPOILER ALERT] they killed off the Shredder in the first movie. They did the same thing in the classic Turtles movie and it always bothers me when they kill off the main villain in the first movie so he can't come back in the sequels.

If you were to sit down with this film without any prior knowledge of the Turtles' universe, you might be able to fully enjoy it and may even say it was a rip-roaring good time. It had great visuals, good action and pacing, and a simple yet engaging story with decent jokes.
However, having grown up with the turtles cartoons, movies, and video games, it will let you down hard. Master Splinter had a completely different personality which wasn't convincing and ultimately failed to evoke empathy for his character. The other turtles were amped up stereotypes of their own characters, which created a strange dissonance that I had a hard time trying to reconcile. In effect there is really no character with which to bond.
That Shredder though, he was pretty badass.",1466553600,2,884,4.673076923076923

6322051,1,B00J2T18XS,"As a fan of the old 80's cartoon show and growing up a huge Ninja Turtles fan, watching this movie wounded my soul. I never saw it in theaters, saw it in the Prime library and thought, I'm sure it couldn't be as bad as I've heard. Wrong! I paid nothing to view this and left feeling owed restitution.

For the good guy line up, the film stars Megan Fox, who, as usual, is a pretty face who can't act her way out of a Pizza Box. The whole contrived story of April O'Neil having the turtles as pets and her dad being a Mutagen scientist is so contrived and unnecessary. She's a reporter, she finds Ninja Turtles, 'nuff said, don't need to complicate it.

The turtles themselves are okay, but underdeveloped in favor of screen time for Fox and lengthy over the top action sequences.

Will Arnett's comedic relief is the one saving grace in this movie.

On the evil side of the fence, you have a wealthy corporate bad guy whose sole motivation for doing evil is to go from really rich to ""stupid rich"" - what? And then there's Shredder who looks like a left over extra from Bay's Transformers debacle and more closely resembles an actual paper shredder than the iconic villain.

On the whole, the film was painfully generic and completely predictable from start to finish.  Only watch this movie if you need a film to make fun of, or need a reminder that not everything needs to be remade.",1465776000,2,1385,4.411764705882353

6322244,3,B00J2T18XS,It is not as bad as I initially thought it would be. I actually found it pretty funny in some parts. The only complaint I have is that they didn't show enough of the turtles. For a movie called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles you would think it would have them front and center. Still not as bad as it could have been.,1465257600,,315,4.096774193548387

6322258,3,B00J2T18XS,"Yeah, it was okay. Probably wouldn't have bothered if it wasn't on Prime. I was entertained while watching it but I wasn't expecting much based on other reviews upon release. The plot for a movie like this is basically just an excuse to get the action going. So the plot is pretty much nonsense and falls apart if you think about it too much. The action is decently entertaining though. There were a few moments though when my brain realized that I was (again) just watching CGI characters with no weight or occupying real space fighting. That took me out of it a bit. That's been a recent trend with a lot of movies though.

Final advice, it was worth the time I spent watching it avoiding doing yard work.",1465257600,,707,4.438461538461539

6322260,5,B00J2T18XS,"My 9 year old and 11 year olds loved it.  They think the cartoon version on television is cheesy, so is the movie but it embraces it.  I'd liken it to a rickety carnival ride in our small town fair.  Thrilling but ready to fall apart at any moment - good harmless fun.  The characters are strangely likable and we all laughed.  Nothing about it is ""realistic"" so the violence didn't bother me and I'm a bit sensitive to that.  The effects are passable.",1465257600,3,452,4.321428571428571

Megan Fox is enjoyable to watch. This revision does look like it is trying to incorporate some Japanime themes into it. And the Turtles at times do take themselves way too seriously. I'm not sure how suitable this may be for children. But as one who was a fan of the original cartoon when I was a kid, it does satiate my inner geek.",1465171200,,479,4.5813953488372094

Since the comics were first published when I was 2, all my reference for the series comes from the original Cartoon series. This movie reminds me more of the first episode of that series. On a more critical note, the movie lost steam towards the middle and the action sequences drag a little. This story arc includes Aprils' boss Vern, and he adds a comedic touch to the human cast, one thing that none of the movies have ever done is portray April, she is story obsessed and is pretty much Lois lane in a Jump suit(1940s and 50s Superman cartoon Lois Lane)at least in the Old Cartoon series anyway, Don't know how she is in the Comics.",1464739200,,827,4.341935483870968

This wasn't Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, it was a Michael Bay movie perpetrating as TMNT.

I guess the problem is really that the kids who grew up loving the Ninja Turtles are not who this movie was made for.  I get remaking something was popular with kids once and updating it so that it can be popular with different kids today, but I think it's lazy to aim for the lowest possible bar.  There are so many movies out there that are for ""kids"" and ""families"" that are also big hits with the grown ups, and I really wish this movie could have been for fans of the franchise, old and new.",1463529600,,669,4.336

6322858,3,B00J2T18XS,"I only heard terrible things about this movie, which actually made it easier for me to enjoy. The action scenes can be pretty fast-paced and upbeat at times, albeit not very martial artsy, and there were a few points where the turtles are suddenly bulletproof or something else impossible, but when you get to these points in the movie it's crucial that you remember a few things:

1. This is a movie about talking, intelligent turtles.
2. These turtles claim to be teenagers.
3. These turtles are also mutants from some sort of genetic experimentation.
4. Of all things, these turtles call themselves ninjas.

I've never been someone who understands much about music, so I can't really give you any sort of reliable assessment of the score. It didn't hurt my ears, so that's a plus.
  All in all, I started this movie expecting to only keep it on for a few minutes so that I could laugh at how terrible it was but ended up finishing it. It made me laugh several times and had some decent feel-good moments. If you can get past the predictability and unbelievably creepy rendering of Master Splinter, you very likely might find yourself pleasantly surprised by the time the credits roll.",1463356800,,1187,4.6923076923076925

6322895,2,B00J2T18XS,"The first two films from the 80s were silly fun, if the plot was utterly ridiculous. TMNT (the computer animated one) was probably the best film thus far. So if a ranking was given this film would compete with the third live film for dead last of the theatrical releases. This doesn't mean there wasn't some good moments or development in this film. Even though Megan Fox is known as a terrible actress, she does a decent job in this film as a mostly career focused woman. They did fall back on using her as a frail woman, unfortunately. She fainted when meeting the Turtles, even though she can handle herself with career terrorists (the Foot)? The use of Whoopi Goldberg as the head of news outlet was a good move and worked well in the film. The elevator scene is the one part of the film that I quite enjoyed.

6322903,4,B00J2T18XS,"Apparently, it didn't do extremely well at the theaters, and I had low expectations. I was pleasantly surprised. It bore little resemblance to the 90's versions of TMNT, however, for a more up to date version, I thought it was an exciting movie. It's not a movie for kids solely on the violence and the overall dark nature of the movie. It had somewhat of a Gotham feel like Batman. Overall, I enjoyed the movie. Much better than what I heard and read about as far as reviews.",1463184000,,476,4.420454545454546

Go into this expecting to have a good time and you'll have just that. The special effects are very well-done as are the action sequences.

I hope to never ever watch this one again. It just wasn't very good. The turtles were ok, their voices were ok, but there was nothing special about any of the characters, human or otherwise, in this movie. Megan Fox isn't even all the pretty. The girl in the 1990 version had attitude. And the guy that was with her (in the 1990 version) was much more interesting. The guy in this movie had absolutely no personality.

It's a kids movie, based on a television cartoon that pretty much all of kiddos watching have no idea that it used to be on TV, much less a critical view of the movie.
I watched the cartoon as a kid. Now the movie as an adult.
Simply put:
Great fun. Exceptional morals, leadership and camaraderie shown throughout.
Fantastic sfx action. Excellent stunt action. Both the live-action work and the CGI are very well done, flow pretty seamlessly for these difficult characters to render. The kids will love it; gamers should dig the gfx/sfx.

Don't miss a fun movie because some grumpy fans/critics panned this flick. Fun action and good-guys winning. Don't miss it.",1462406400,,760,4.801526717557252

The story isn't terrible and the banter between the brothers is nice. Will Arnett is kinda funny. Megan Fox might be the worst actress ever. Shredder looks like a Transformer and his dialogue isn't very good. Michael Bay loves that guy-dodging-things-coming-toward-the-camera-in-slow-motion-with-that-dumb-woo-woo-woo-sound-effect scene that is every single movie he's made. They make a couple of homages to older, better movies that don't rely on CGI and slow-motion effects to make the movie good.

6323467,1,B00J2T18XS,"Watching this movie (TMNT 2014) was a mind numbing waste of 1.5 hours of my life (probably lost a few IQ points in the process). It is rated PG-13, but most kids 13 or older would be bored with the quality of this movie. Doesn't make much sense (plot, script, etc). A movie for the sake of making a movie. Typical flash-cut action scenes. It might entertain a 5 or 6 year old child for a few hours (if you can stomach it playing in the background).",1459641600,,448,4.160919540229885
6323468,2,B00J2T18XS,"Growing up watching the original movies on big and small screen were great times in my childhood. I feel that this movie was lacking in dialog and casting. Megan fox is good in some movies, just way off the mark for this one. The CGI was good, fight scenes were great. The dialog was either stale or was so predictable it made the movie almost boring.

6323486,3,B00J2T18XS,"I still like the originals.  They aren't perfect either.  I could not buy the Shredder's robotic suit, nor the magnetic throwing knives. It was too over the top.  Maybe, in the 2nd movie. But, before the Ninja Turtles, Shredder was all of that...unbelievable.  Many times it didn't make sense that the Shredder didn't kill or seriously injure the Turtles. Where was the connection to Master Splinter vs Shredder? He trained himself by reading books and taught the Turtles to be ninja's?  The original movies had him at least watch his master and injure the Shredder.  The somewhat connection and/ or the anger against Splinter by Shredder was blah.  Raphael's cracked shell was believable...until...he used duct tape and then was launched into an armored vehicle before launched again.--Very excited to hear Rock Steady & Beebop are in the next one. And, to hear that maybe the Turtles faces are going to be slightly adjusted to the retro look.  If not for my kid, I'd give the movie 2 stars.  A PG-13 movie advertised heavily for under 13 children is not the best idea.  Even they probably didn't get the big show down of the last fight, not to mention the epic (of a fail) fall from the building. --I thought the action was alright for all members of the family, but the cussing was not needed.  Although, I still give a bravo for not making it worse.",1459209600,,1353,4.690677966101695

6323600,2,B00J2T18XS,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, suffers the same array of problems that the Michael Bay directed Transformers films have suffered. The film takes emphasis away from the title characters of the film to put an increased focus on the human characters. To the film's credit, it doesn't clutter up the film with the same degree of human characters as the Transformers film did, but those elements of the film distract from the main thrust of the narrative. Further, the rest of the film's action is so cluttered and chaotic that it can't compensate for the rest of the film's weak points.

The film follows April O'Neil, played by Megan Fox. April, like her counterparts in the first film and animated series, is a reporter for Channel 6 news in New York City, who is investigating an increase in the crime rate brought on by a mysterious criminal organization known as the Foot. This is, also, unfortunately, where everything starts to fall apart. This version of the Foot is less a ninja clan, and more a PMC, carrying assault weapons, driving heavy machine gun equipped Hummers and so on. In the original film, The Foot had managed to operate with a considerable amount of subtlety and discretion. In the original animated series, Shredder and Krang were generally operating out in the open, but they still maintained the pretense of being a ninja clan, as opposed to going full Cobra. Here, they've gone full Cobra.

While investigating this organization, April discovers the existence of the title characters, and eventually their origin - the film's second major and dramatic break from the source material. In this version of the Turtle's origin, the Turtles and Splinter were laboratory experiments worked on by April's father, a scientist, along with another scientist, Eric Sacks, played by William Fichner. After a tragic fire broke out in the lab, April saved the turtles and Splinter, but was unable to save her father. If you're familiar at all with Fichner's recent filmography, it should be clear from early on the film that Sacks killed April's father - with the real mystery for the audience being not being the reveal of his identity, but why he killed April's father.

This also means that while the turtles certainly have a connection to April, and, by extension, Sacks, their historic connection with Shredder, through Oroku Saki, and Saki's connection with Hamato Yoshi (Splinter's former owner), is gone. The writers attempted to replace this connection with a contrivance that the Shredder is Sack's master, but this information is hidden until the middle of the film, and it's not clear why. This also means that while in earlier films Splinter was written as a Japanese American, either through casting (Mako in the animated film), or the voice acting performances for the character (as in the first two live-action films). Here those elements were absent. it almost feels like Whitewashing.

This leads into April and the Turtles attempting to defeat Shredder and Sacks, and where the film's action sequences come in. These sequences are either unfortunately darkly lit, or very chaotically structured. Early on in the film, fights are shot in a way where the Turtles aren't clearly defined in the film's environments - initially to play up the stealth elements of their fighting style. However, in the middle of the film, the amount of stealth used in those sequences is downplayed significantly, yet the characters are constatly shown in shadow, as if the director and crew were not confident in their CG.

In the back half of the film, the Turtles are more clearly lit, but the action sequences are also more chaotic and more difficult to track. There's a mix of shakey-cam, and enough visual clutter and busyness on screen to make it hard to figure out geography and more than the general gist of the fight scene. There are exceptions, fortunately. In particular, Splinter's fight with Shredder and the Foot is very well done, in terms of choreography and composition.

This is still a better film than TMNT III, but that is damning with faint praise. Otherwise, the film is completely missable, and indeed should be missed.",1458259200,3,4149,4.971181556195965

I felt they did a great job that's far as casting the right characters to play everything was right on point from the storyline told of choreographed action in the movie an amazing stunt work also I also like how they went and did like a little back story on how the Ninja Turtles were originally created they went in a little different direction than the older movies but in my opinion it was still a great movie with a great storyline if you feel my review to be helpful please check it was helpful thanks,1458000000,,1003,4.2565445026178015

6323750,3,B00J2T18XS,"The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are a strong enough franchise to not only survive a bad incarnation, but also imbue an otherwise stinky one with a level of charm. Their latest movie  directed by Jonathan Liebesman (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Battle-Los-Angeles/dp/B0034G4ORC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Battle: Los Angeles</a>) and produced under a storm of fan protest by professional polarizer Michael Bay  exemplifies these points by being a middle-of-the-road action movie with a few inspired moments. While much better than I had expected, its ultimately a $125 million video game lacking emotional clout.

The story: Four ninjutsu-practicing mutants are New York Citys last line of defense against the criminal Foot Clans murderous scheme to bring both the metropolis and the world under their control.

The movie struggles to find its balance as it tries to pander to both nostalgia nuts and the PG-13 crowd. Personalities and storytelling are blunted, and mesh awkwardly with the post-modern humor. I enjoyed the scripts take on some characters - like the adorably nerdy Donatello (Jeremy Howard) - and I appreciated the relationship between the TMNTs and their papa Splinter (Tony Shalhoub), but I was turned off by the spectacularly unfunny Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) and horrified by what a socially-subnormal weirdo the movie passes off as April ONeil (Megan Fox). Theres a handful of legitimately humorous moments to even out the parts where you're just laughing at the weird ideas the film presents with a straight face. When weighed together, this all merely amounts to a dramatically staid story. No surprises, not much in the way of emotion, and not even anything in the way of pulpy charm.

The action content is a combination of fight scenes and larger environmental pieces. The latter aspect is a trademark of Michael Bay, whose crew has a knack for creating computer-driven adrenaline scenes that are very fluid but too bombastic to be taken seriously  just check out the so-cool-its-silly chase down the mountain. The fight scenes are a nuanced set, but I have to admit that there were some that I really liked. The best onscreen performer isn't one of the Turtles but Splinter, whose choreography in his fight against the Foot soldiers feels like a combination of something out of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Revenge-of-the-Sith/dp/B00005JLXH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Revenge of the Sith</a>&nbsp;and the work of Donnie Yen. The strength of the choreography sustains subsequent fights, but their pacing makes them feel less like karate encounters and more like a video game, with a ton of slow motion and other directorial gaga in place by the time we reach the showdown with the Shredder (Tohoru Masamune).

Also, I have to say it: the Turtles are butt-ugly. Though I know some die-hards who approve of these abominations, I think it looks like someone took their pre-production sculptures and melted their faces before converting them to 3D. But I got used to the design, much like I got used to the other faults, and was surprised to come away from the movie focusing more on its strengths than its weaknesses. Though theres no shortage to how much better its characters and story could have been handled, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles makes an impression with its visuals and gets my blood pumping. The filmmakers have laid groundwork for themselves, and while I won't get my hopes up too high, it would be great if they could build on it in with the upcoming sequel and fill in the organic gaps in this ones armor.",1457308800,2,3633,5.363157894736842

If you like Megan Fox, sure. Does it have Teenage Turtles? No. These are mid-20s turtles that are vastly different than the turtles that we all knew growing up.
I would not recommend at all. If you want to see the best part, watch the clip they released of the turtles beat-boxing in an elevator. Other than that, easily skip the whole thing!",1457136000,,518,4.350515463917525

I liked how the turtles were made to look like actual human/turtle mutants, not giant cute foam turtles. Many complaints were about this very fact (they liked the cartoonish foam look). Ha. I hated those cutesy foam Turtles,  these guys  definitely can emote, and looked badass. They actually acted like teenagers. Michelangelo's comments about everything "" She's hot! My shell is tightening!"".  The little number they put together on the fly  in the elevator then switch gears to fighting mode was fun. The fact that the end song Mikey used to serenade April was sung by the band the Turtles. Of course there was pizza, and one Kowabunga. It was fun funny fast action packed. I'll probably wind up buying this. Will Arnett and Meg Fox made it interesting and didn't suck, their acting was believable and not wooden.

And what's up with how some of the turtles are these weird semi-racist black stereotypes? That's not how I remember the brothers in the comics or other movies. The product placement is downright distracting, the turtles are over-flanderized caricatures, and it says a lot when I say that the only person not phoning it in was Megan Fox. It's actually kind of sad how much she effort seemed to put in for this role when no one else looked like they gave a s***.

It gets two stars because it's at least better than FanFourStic, Kind of.",1456531200,2,641,4.478632478632479

Aside from the turtles, the movie plot was really TERRIBLE and such a predictable film, and a lot of details were just bad and unexplained or poorly thought out.

6324058,4,B00J2T18XS,"I grew up watching in the late 80's early 90's and watch the oldies on dvd with my 5 year old.  My wife and I really enjoyed this rendition of TMNT.

As for this movie, based on other reviews you'd think it had shoddy CGI, terrible punch-lines and zero heart.  I would argue the opposite on every count.  Perhaps some critics were hoping for an ""adult"" TMNT that favored the storied original comics, but TMNT branding remains locked in to young boys.  As such, the jokes, action, pace and fun vibe of the movie is what you would expect, with plenty of thoughtful bonus touches.

I reserve 5 stars only for my personal all time favorites.  Considering the genre (kid flick, nostalgic, humorous action) this was easily 4.

It was a pleasant surprise.  Especially liked Mikie's personality and most of his jokes.  Enjoyed what they did with the turtles' different sizes and accessories relative to their known personalities.

Biggest negative: Shredder's costume design was the most glaring lack of subtlety for the whole show.  He came out looking like a super shredder robot in his very first fight scene.",1455580800,,1104,4.783068783068783

6324064,2,B00J2T18XS,"Giving this one 2 stars for the impressive cg effects but that is as far as it goes. Being a fan of the original books, I had high hopes for this version storywise. Clearly whoever wrote the script has never read the books and knows nothing of these characters and what makes them appealing. Just more mindless explosions and slo mo transformers type nonsense. With all the great storylines to draw from in the new graphic novel franchise reboot like ""city fall"", we instead got this cg filled disappointment. Not a fan of the sequel trailer either.

6324161,2,B00J2T18XS,"This movie was probably about 2 hours long, and I never did understand what was really going on; I believe that two hours is ample time to answer that question. In order to keep from spoiling the movie (if that's even possible with a plotless movie) I'll just say this:

1. The point of the movie is not very clearly defined. This is a must for any movie! An audience should be able to identify the plot-line of a movie, even if it sucked. In short, this movie isn't good, it's not even bad.

2. The ninja turtles aren't just out of character, but apparently they are also incapable of making other facial expressions besides ""pissed off."" I'm not kidding. There may have been three moments in the whole movie with very brief facial changes...I think it was the look of surprise. There were often times where their voices would sound excited, but they would look so miffed up, the result would be a confusing effect that cast an  overall mood where I didn't know if I should feel angry or excited, and both were inappropriate for the scene.

3. Who is Shredder?  And is it Shreddar like cheese (cheddar/shreddar?), or shredder like paper? Now I know there are some old school fans out there who know who he is (I'm one of them) but the movie really doesn't explain anything except that he exists and is evil. Sweet! So was Voldemort, so was the Green Goblin, so was Magneto, and countless other evil dudes who were far better explained in other movies. We know that bad guys are bad, the question is why? Who is he? What is he doing? Other than wanting to kill some turtles who were...created, and something about New York (you'll have to watch it....but you probably shouldn't) and more importantly (and this is where they really failed) WHY is he doing it? If you ask me...they should've just stole the plot from one of the old movies. It would have been better.

All those things came to together and made a weird and boring movie with tons of useless action with no plotline. (Also random inappropriate jokes, though not nearly as bad as the second Transformers)",1455321600,,2066,4.540322580645161

The dynamic between the characters was well built, and they even, get this, developed those characters.

It's like Michael Bay heard there was a thing called the teenage mutant ninja turtles and got bored while making it.

Shredder is basically Iron Man with that suit and all the gadgets it has, the turtles look stupid, their new background makes no sense, it's just bad all around. Maybe if I'd never seen the cartoons or been aware of the turtles before it might be slightly enjoyable.

6324231,2,B00J2T18XS,I have been a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles fan a long time. The original canon was awesome. This movie is a cgi horror show. Bad actress Megan Fox performance is laughable. The turtles are so ugly they look like four cgi alien predator relatives. This is not suppose to be a horror movie. The story was really badly done. This movie is a cgi mess. The video game makers would probably never use the ugly turtle models used in this film version for a game. Just because the film makers over use cgi does not make the film a winner. People are getting tired of computer cartoons.,1454803200,,577,4.401869158878505

Even though I would have thought they would have used a lower key actress that would have played to April's demeanor a little better. I thought Megan fox did a good job.

6324651,4,B00J2T18XS,"I am not a fan of the series.  Never read the 80s comic book or watched a single episode of the tv show from that same era.  I guess it also becomes obvious that I never watched any of the movies that were made before this new iteration.  However, in a sense, I'm the perfect person to go into a movie like this blindly as a ""newbie"" to judge this world devoted to four 6' teenage anthropomorphic turtles who live in the sewers of NYC and fight crime with their ninjutsu skills.

Color me...surprised.  While Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3D remains mostly geared for teens and younger with its juvenile humor and tamed
violence, I was quite taken back by the film's level of production. This is certainly a Blockbuster orientated release and as such, all stops have been
pulled to push the envelope on its effects and entertainment value.  It's no wonder that the film has not only been released in 3D, but has Dolby putting its Atmos brand behind it as well.  More on that in just a moment...

If you are like me and have no idea of the history behind these crime-fighting leatherbacks, don't fret....the film does an excellent job of giving viewers a complete history of how a laboratory accident allowed the mutations of the four turtles: Leonardo, Michelangelo. Raphael, Donatello and their master, Splinter, a rat who became their adoptive father and taught them the ways of ninjutsu.

As the film opens we find that New York City is under attack from the a criminal organization known as the Footclan.  It's leader, Splinter, is a
sinister, highly-skilled dark master of ninjutsu.  One evening, a young, beautiful reporter named April O'Neal (Megan Fox), who has been investigating the Footclan activities, suddenly stumbles upon a crime-in-progress that puts her face-to-face with the city's superheroes. April attempts to convince her editor (Whoopi Goldberg) to break this sensational story in the news, but soon finds that no-one will believe that these crime fighting vigilantes even exist.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is filled with cutting-edge effects thanks to the efforts of Industrial Light & Magic.  Their motion-capture system that uses actors in body suits to emulate the turtle characters, comes off with very convincing results. And, with Michael Bay's production team behind the helm, it's no surprise that this film contains some very impressive over-the-top action sequences and effects work.

The transfer, in a word, is ""fantastic.""  Colors look suitable, and black levels are deep.  There is not one digital distraction to be seen anywhere.  Picture is so crisp that the amount of detail that can be seen within the turtle faces and long hairs attached to Splinter's nose is just immense. The day-lit scenes of New York City benefit the most from this transfer. They just ""pop"" with vibrancy, as do their neon-lit signs at night.

The 3D is a mixed bag.  Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3D is not so much an out-of-display experience than it is in-display.  This is another typical film that production felt would be better upconverted than shot natively in 3D.  As all of you are aware, this greatly limits the format's impact.  Fortunately, there is an excellent level of depth represented here that saves this film from being a completely wasted upconverted effort.  New York is one of my favorite cities in the world, and I was quite pleased to see how much was filmed on and below its streets and how perfectly the
enhanced definition brings this metropolis to life like never before.  There is an absolute sense of expansive space as the camera swoops above and across the city during a climatic showdown between Shredder and the Ninja Turtles.  It's quite astounding.

I was surprised that a feature called ""In Your Face! The Turtles in 3D"" is included as a special feature.  I would not even venture to say that this film contains any impressive level of pop-out to quantify that claim.  I mean, c'mon, this is a film that was upconverted to 3D in post production.  That's one hell of a major strike against it.  There is no blatant ""In Your Face"" pop-out anywhere.  At best, some bladed objects as well as chunks of rock and snow do manage to slightly protrude themselves forward. I will tell you that this film is absolutely littered with light spots, smoke and floating debris that were purposely placed to give viewers an added sense of layered 3D effect.  Those are the elements that when combined with background depth, look very pleasing to the eye. Elements like falling snow, flying sparks and floating dust debris often place themselves just outside of the screen as if they are darting right before your eyes.  I just wish Michael Bay would stop using so much sunspot type effects in his film.  It's grossly overused here.

Absolutely no ghosting or crosstalk to be seen.

As I previously mentioned, Dolby had enough faith to attach their Atmos sound technology to this film.  While I do not have a Dolby Atmos compatible system (as of yet), I knew that the mix would automatically be reconfigured for my 7.1 setup (and subsequently 5.1 systems).
This is one hell of a powerhouse audio mix even at 7.1 level.  The overall sound design is nothing short of amazing with a precise level of detail that is craftily delegated to specific speakers across the entire soundstage.  The clanging of swords jump across channels while the swoosh of bullets whiz by your ears.  With our turtle heroes dispersed in every direction, it's not uncommon to hear them communicate from one channel to another.  LFE activity is extremely aggressive as it accents every punch and explosion on screen. Even Brian Tyler's choral-filled score gets some impressive LFE undertones.  This is certainly a soundtrack that can be considered demo material.  It's no wonder Dolby has their Atmos name behind it.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3D arrives as a 3-disc set housed in lenticular cardboard packaging.  The discs include the Blu-ray 3D, Blu-ray and DVD feature discs and Digital HD content.  Extras include the usual behind-the-scenes production features as well as a ""Shell Shocked"" Music video.

As someone new to the franchise, not not knowing any of the history behind these characters, I found Teenage Ninja Turtles 3D to be a tolerable, entertaining experience. Most of that was due to it's extremely aggressive (and impressive) soundtrack and level of depth that its 3D presentation provides.  The 3D presentation won't even make my most recommended list, but it is still somewhat satisfying -- particularly for its scenes on and above the streets of New York City.

Hardcore fans of the turtle series may not like this film as much as I did.",1453075200,,6671,4.897595725734639

I find her acting very flat and 2 dimensional.  Her main claim to fame is her looks and that only holds up for a second or two for anyone over the emotional age of 15.  Anyway, back to the movie.  The entire plot is just a reworking of the script for Amazing Spiderman.  Come on.  Isn't there anyone in Hollywood with an original thought?  The action was good but nothing spectacular.  The special fx are again good but not groundbreaking.  A real waste of the talents of Whoopie Goldberg and Wil Arnett.

It was not until I got it for free on amazon prime did I watch it. I was blown away. There were few changes that did not add to the story in meaningful ways. It made the turtles more impressive for a modern generation used to everything big.  The acting and dialogue of the turtles is brilliant.  April Oneal has never been important so I could care less who they cast but Fox is adequate. The changes to the plot make it seem slightly more realistic and feasable,  while they do still manage to like fun at the sillyness of the concept. The action is non stop.

There is a really cool snow mountain action scene that was amazing.

The CGI work is excellent.  Whether you prefer puppets, animations, or fx make-up, the workmanship on the CGI turtles were undeniably impressive.  The only problem with the CGI maybe the decision to make Master Splinter a bald wet rat.

I lopped off a star from my rating because of a few story line flaws I couldn't forgive.  I wished the story started out with the turtles and stayed on the turtles.  I felt April O'neil should have been a supporting character, not the main one.  This movie should have been titled ""The Adventures of April O'neil and the Mutant Turtles"".  My other beef with this movie were the side stories about Eric Sachs and Shredder.  Their motives for being evil felt a little flimsy.

I was also surprised at some of the adult humor in this.  It's not terrible, but it might be too racy for really young kids under 10 watch this movie.  Either they might not get some things or you'll have to explain it.

PS: It is nothing like the beloved animated TV show cartoon from the 80's and 90's.  Other than that, it is a fun light-hearted action adventure film, if you keep that in mind.",1450396800,,1388,4.405511811023622

Let's of course be fair to the negative reviews: Michael Bay and the Transformers movies appear not just in Shredder, but also in the sound effects. Pay close enough attention and most of the action scenes have audio ripped directly from his other movies.

Having said that: I came in with low expectations, but it had several funny moments, the action was far better than I was prepared for, and I thought the turtles themselves were more interesting than in the past. They seemed more nuanced, less caricatured.

And his motives are not some weird vendetta, or convoluted ideological disparity with American culture. No. He just wants more money for the sake of having more money - no crazy debt, or evil plan that needs funding. There is no reason given for going through with all this, save getting more money. Never mind that he is releasing said chemical agent from his own building, effectively destroying his company's standing in the world.

6324748,3,B00J2T18XS,"As a huge fan of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, I grew up watching the cartoons, the movies, and I have even read all of the comics done by Kevin Eastman, including the classics, the ultimate collection, and the newest series. I had the toys, the sewer system, the pizza thrower, the turtle van and about 30 different themed turtles including the originals. And when I was very young, my parents took me to Six Flags to watch the ""Coming Out of Their Shells Tour"" in which I won't go into great detail about. I feel I've read or watched every iteration of the turtle's back story. So as a kid growing up at the time the turtles were at their peak and being a huge fan still at the age of 29, I feel I owe it to myself and to others to do this review.

****Spoiler Alert**** I will probably reveal parts of the movie, comics, and previous movies in my review.

The Good:

The characters personalities are spot on. I honestly thought that Johnny Knoxville doing Leo's voice would ruin the movie for me, but he did an outstanding job with the voice of Leo in this movie. Donny is still the nerd, Leo is still the Leader, Mikey is still the party animal, and Raph is still angry all the time.

Karai is in the movie. She is Shredder's great great great...etc Grand Daughter in the comics and plays a significant roll as well. I may go into detail about that later.

The turtles are not from outer space. Thank God that was just a rumor. I would have buried Michael Bay in this review if that were the case. The ooze is still the chemical that turns the turtles and Splinter into what they are.

I like that Michael Bay didn't make this movie as long as all of his transformer movies and kept the back story to a minimum. It leaves room to reveal more later, and to answer unanswered questions in future movies. I feel as though this movie is just kind of an acquaintance meet and greet movie with the turtles for people who have never seen or read about ninja turtles to get a feel for what they who they are and who they're against. Not to reveal all details of their past, shredders past, and the foot's past. Those details could be made into a movie by themselves depending on which iteration Michael Bay is going with.

I like that Raph says why he's angry all the time in his speech as the turtles are hurled to the earth in a near death experience. It's something I think he owes fans for a long time coming.

The back story is somewhat like the comic books in that they were a lab experiment that April let's loose when she's very young, but it ends there. The comics go into how splinter and the turtles are reincarnated with the souls of a Japanese Ninja and his four sons from futile Japan that were murdered by Oroku Saki (otherwise known as the shredder, in case you didn't know). In this movie, splinter finds an old martial arts book and reads it and learns it, and then he teaches the turtles. If this is how the backstory stays, I'll probably dock another star in a few years when the second turtle movie is released. But If the story goes into any details about splinter or the turtles being from futile Japan, I am all in on this movie series because I will have a better idea of where the story is going.

This movie wasn't as bad as the movie Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 3 that released in 1993. Although it doesn't take much to be better than that one.

The Cons:

This movie doesn't even show the turtles fighting regular crime on the streets. They're crime fighters too. They're only enemy isn't just The Foot. Or at least that's what my impression has been growing up with them. This movie portrays the foot as the turtles' only enemy and there is not a single fight scene where they're just stopping a robbery or a mugging, or anything like that. It goes straight to the docks where they throw shipping containers. That's one of the flaws in the plot IMHO.

Meagan Fox is April O'Neal and she doesn't have red hair. Both of those facts are a con. Need I say More?

Shredder looks like a transformer. Yup. Thanks Michael Bay for ruining Shredders suit after you've done a few Transformer movies too many. The turtles are dressed with items that represent their personality. They couldn't just let you see what each turtle's personality was, they had to make it so obvious it's all over them. I guess whoever thought of that had very little faith in the minds of people who went to see this movie. I mean really? Donnatello...with GLASSES???? AND what seems like a backpack from the Ghost Busters. I mean COME ON.

Splinter learned martial arts solely from a book he ""just so happened to find"" ""conveniently laying in the sewer"". But as I said previously, this back story could still turn into something more complex so I'm not losing faith just yet.

A little more plot depth. I can put the plot into one sentence. Here: The ninja turtles were part of a lab experiment, learned martial arts from their rat master who learned it from a book, fight against shredder and the foot clan until shredder tracks April O'Neal to their home in the sewer, kidnaps almost all of them, and then Raph, April, and Vernon go on a road trip to save them, and in the process they just go ahead and defeat shredder while they're at it. Ok so it's not grammatically correct, but my point remains the same. It's still a very shallow plot.

Final thoughts on the movie:

The movie itself wasn't spectacular. It had it's moments that made me laugh. It had it's moments (Raph) that gave me goosebumps the first time I watched it.  It is similar to the plot from the 1990 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, but it isn't as bad as the third movie where they go back in time to Futile Japan. Although I'm giving this movie the benefit of the doubt, I'm very excited and very nervous of how the story develops from here. I will always have a special place in my heart for the turtles, but this movie didn't add any significance to that place nor did it degrade that place. It simply was somewhere in the middle and that's how I will rate it until I see each sequel that comes after this one.",1449273600,,6078,4.37322695035461

I'm embarrassed to admit that she knows who the characters are. I know their names; but, I always get mixed up with ""who is who"". She pinpoints each one and corrects me. My husband and I just laugh because she is definitely more interested in TMNT than I ever was when I was younger. Ahem, I believe I was a few years older than her when it was popular back in my day.
Honestly, I know that if you're a TMNT fan you'll be impartial to the original movie and this one won't live up to it. However, it's over 20 years later, so I understand how the studio tries to attract and appeal to the kids today and somehow tries to incorporate some old with new. My only qualms are that the turtles look too ""roided"" and Splinter looks extremely grimy (I know real rats are; but....you get the idea). I'm not going to nitpick every aspect of this movie; but, I can't remember how Splinter and the turtles learned Ninjitsu in the original movie; but, this movie depicted that Splinter learned it from a manual that was laying in the sewer and he taught himself and then the turtles. Of course, having done martial arts for a few years and for my husband who has practiced martial arts for over 20 years; this is inaccurate. However, this is a movie ie. make believe. We won't get bent out of shape about this.
Overall, the movie is definitely more ""updated"" than when I was a child.  I know I'll be watching this a few more times since this is one of my daughter's favorite movies.",1448064000,,1606,4.2655737704918035

6325044,2,B00J2T18XS,"This movie was a wonderful exhibition of CGI, and the connection between computer technology and film-making.  Unfortunately, the story falls flat.  There was never any real tension, which made the nearly obscene product placement seem even more obvious, if not desperate.  As I recall, the 1990 TMNT release actually had some heart even if it was predictable that the good guys would win in the end.  Sometimes our memories fail us, so feel welcome to take this 2-star review with a grain of salt.

Wife: Can I watch the new Ninja Turtles without you?
Me: Go for it.
Wife: Yesssssss
[15 minutes later]
Wife: So far, it's terrible.
[90 minutes later]
Me: Headed home, need anything?
Wife: An hour and 41 minutes of my life back.

Though to be fair, she kind of did this to herself, telling me ""11 minutes in I realized it was awful, but not awful enough to not finish it.""

So I feel like that's worth 2 stars. I imagine she would turn it off if it was bad enough (hopefully).",1447977600,,589,4.241071428571429

Good spfx, lively action, and decent personality differentiations between the four terrapins made for some entertaining viewing.  Meagan Fox, as pretty and sexy as she has been portrayed, is not sexed up here at all.  Shes portrayed as kind of crazy/ nave (but of course shes really not).  She and Will Arnett are affable but comic book thin concoctions.  The turtles and Splinter are more fully realized characters.  But I didn't care because I wasn't looking for a lot out of this film.

But this could have been done sooooo much better. Watch the original TMNT movies and then watch this. We've seriously taken a big leap backward. 20 years later the original movies are still classic art to me. This smells of cheapened film.

That said, had I not known how great it COULD have been I might not hate it. They changed a couple of huuuuge things from the original story though and that's just annoying.

About half an hour in, I was impressed with a few parts of the story. Action scenes were good. No complaints of course about having to gaze at Megan Fox. I would say what made the movie was comic relief and very well made action scenes. I would say what broke the movie would be the easy to predict conclusion. I easily predicted the buck buck teamwork at the end from the original buck buck scene. Overall a decent film. I would say TMNT would not approve despite the movie's pros.

6325245,2,B00J2T18XS,"The Turtles get the Michael Bay treatment.

Terrible character design - just because they can: The Turtles and Splinter look horribly unattractive. They wholly lack the delight & charm of the cartoons', the first Henson movie's or the original comics' design. The Shredder apparently carries (probably literally) a ton of metal armor, yet is supposed to be a nimble match of any of them. Whoopi looks as if she ate a whole other Whoopi.

The story is unfocused, (are we following April or the Turtle quartet?) unsurprising and unoriginal.

It's not terrible (if you go in expecting a Bay type of movie - they could film the (over edited and overly close) fights and set pieces action properly seeing how it's all computer animated, if they don't it's because the chose to,) but it's just not good.

I honestly didn't make it through that scene... It was so... I just lost interest when the story took a backseat to the flashy explosions...

6325427,3,B00J2T18XS,"Definitely not the original, but stands on its own pretty well. To compare this with the original is like trying to compare the new Star Trek films to the original cast, and misding the point. I dislike the term 'reboot', when its more of an update. Even stories like Cinderella have evolved and changed over time, you don't see people reviewing the Disney version complaining that the stepsisters didn't cut off their toes to fit in the shoe.

This is a new take on the story of the Turtles, keeping fairly true to their basic roots while better tying in April and even The Shredder to the boys. It keeps their personalities true and distinct, sets up the general dynamics, and gives some laughs and action.

Some of the humor felt too juvenile, and the explaination of things a bit sudden, with what felt like far too much focus on April trying to be a 'real' reporter and too quick of dissmissal by her boss. Deliberate loose ends felt annoying, I personally dislike movies directly setting themselves up for sequels, but seems to be something Bay in particular specializes in as a filmmaker.  Im glad the alien origin rumors weren't true.

Overall, a decent film that tried to go slow and then had to speed up to catch up with where it should have been, a not awful insert into the multiple varients that exist, and looked pretty solid visually.",1445644800,5,1349,4.608333333333333

6325522,2,B00J2T18XS,"Pros:
Some of the action sequences were great. Especially some of the major fight scenes in the middle of the movie.
Shredder was as cartoonishly ruthless as I was hoping he would be.
Will Arnett was half-way kinda decent and played a good Fenwick (the character is suppose to be as dense as a sack of door nails).

Cons:
Megan Fox.
Megan Fox.
Did I mention Megan Fox?
Seriously though I can't stress just how bad the acting is in this entire movie. Like, seriously abysmal. Not only from Megan but all the actors (maybe except for Shredder). It doesn't help that the scriptwriting was bad too. It got to the point where I thought Megan Fox's character April O'Neil was intentionally sabotaging main characters in the film due to her absolute sheer stupidity. I'm really trying not to give a way main plot points, but she is a COLLEGE GRAD (although she really should be in high school if we are sticking to lore) and she makes so many unbelievable mistakes that it makes me wonder how she got through college in the first place.

Why am I harping on her character? Cause the OTHER major problem in this film is that you spend SOOOOOOO much time on April that it feels like a movie about her life instead of the lives of, you know, THE FREAKIN TURTLES?! I know they did this as a way to tie her to their story, but when you write her in as nothing more than a cinematic equivalent of the Dodo bird (ie so stupid that she has zero self preservation instinct in the film) and pair it with the fact that Megan Fox can't act then you have a train wreck waiting to happen. She's hot. We get it. Can we move on?

I would give this movie one star if it wasn't for all the hard work that clearly went into the CG and set design in the movie.  To those guys I say thank you. To Will Arnett, your better than this. To Megan Fox, maybe stick to Rom-Coms?",1445472000,3,1843,4.257142857142857

It provided more details and a more realistic explanation on how the Teenage Ninja Turtles were mutated.  Certain scenes such as the chase in the snow kind of got ridiculous with it's Computer Generated (CG) visuals, but the characters overall were better developed and visually more heroic.  The movie was fun to watch, but the ending was poorly developed as the fall was also unrealistic even though I liked the fable-ish discussion the turtles had during the fall.  It could have been done differently to get the same results.  Overall, I enjoyed the movie very much.

It lacks the heart and soul of Ninja Turtles, which as a child I absolutely loved.  Too much time is spent on Megan Fox (whose acting in this film is WORSE than Transformers Revenge of the Fallen), I am here to watch the turtles and I don't give two s**** about her, I wanted more action on the turtles.

They give you a bit of background and a little of the story and the rest you just have to assume.",1445126400,,296,4.120689655172414
6325563,2,B00J2T18XS,"So.  Many.  Plot.  Holes.  The only thing saving this from a 1-star rating is it had just enough nostalgic in-jokes that brought a smile to my face to *almost* make me not regret the time I wasted watching this.  I'm not even going to try listing all the plot holes, as I would wind up writing out almost the entire plot.

And not only was the plot *weak*, but as others have noted, it is also incredibly unoriginal.  You know the Shredder's main accomplice from the first second he's on the screen.  We have April O'Neal playing the part of Peter Parker from the most recent Spiderman re-boot (scientist Daddy gets involved in the wrong sort of experiment, winds up getting killed, leaves child behind with Daddy all sorts of unresolved Daddy issues).  There's absolutely nothing surprising in this movie; you'll know pretty much what to expect from about 10 minutes in (if it even takes that long).

Also the clichs... my goodness the clichs.  Donatello is the smartest turtle, so of course he has to have glasses.  Michaelangelo is the comic relief so he can't have any real depth (not that they really developed any of the Turtles' characters) - he's cracking jokes even when he thinks Leonardo potentially dead from falling off a cliff.  The Shredder had enough blades integrated into his armor to make it beyond absurd even for a comic/movie Super Villain.  And so it goes - on and on and on...

Also, unsurprisingly I suppose given Michael Bay - who put out the ""Transformers"" movies with so little actual screen time for the Transformers that they should have been called ""Humans"" - is listed as a producer, there is very little meaningful screen time for the Turtles.  They show up in the fight scenes - which are also very reminiscent to those in Transformers - but otherwise they might have well called this ""The April O'Neal Story.""

Overall I would not recommend this movie unless you're really desperate for a way to waste 101 minutes.",1445126400,2,1949,4.685294117647059

The film was a debacle.  The characterizations stink. It's an over-wrought CGI-fest of implausible yet cliche action scenes.  Then again, it is a Michael Bay film, so what can we expect?

Megan Fox is lip-injected and talentless.. boring-to-watch and totally unbelievable as a news reporter.  Shredder has a thousand knives coming out of his suit, but never once uses them when he has the upper hand, instead preferring to throw or grab his opponents... who continually frustratingly get their butts kicked.  There isn't a single gratifying moment in all the fight scenes. I could go on, but would prefer not to waste any more time on this drivel.  Don't watch.",1444953600,,871,4.805369127516778

They re-imagined a number of the details, so I think it is important to look at this as its own movie instead of being upset it doesn't match what you might remember from being a kid. The turtles have 4-5 different origin stories including characters with widely different personalities / stories, so this is not unique to the movie. I also feel like this movie did a better job than any other adaptation of treating their personalities like teenagers instead of being mildly immature adults.

I think it had just the right amount of action and jokes that make you groan. I only docked one star because I feel like the turtles shape could be scary for some kids, and I wasn't really a fan of making them very strong.",1444867200,,795,4.482758620689655

The story was so predictable that I knew the bad guy and the twist in the first few minutes of the film.  Megan Fox as April Oneil? I felt like I was watching Transformers again. The character development of the turtles was terrible.  Are they tough guys or are they goofy teens? They tried to keep the goofy teen element for the classic fans but their characters were not believable because it was clearly an afterthought.  I'm not comic book junky, certainly not a ""purist"".  I just want to suspend my disbelief and have fun watching a fun film.  There were too many character and story faults for me to enjoy this.",1444176000,,701,4.4296875

The plot is strange, the acting is weak, and the world doesn't make much sense.  Rather than comment on the overall poor quality of the movie, here are some specific things that were just silly.

Why did the turtles have to be 9 feet tall with literal and explicit super strength?  They are already mutant ninjas, isn't that enough?
How come they only made one super suit for shredder? Mass producing that thing would have been way more effective and lucrative than the weird bio-weapon plan.
So your explanation for how they became ninjas is that Splinter taught himself both master level martial arts AND a stereotypical accent by finding a series of how to manuals in the sewers?
Why doesn't the NYC sewer system have any water in it, and why don't the turtles' shells seem to have any friction with the sewer walls?
The turtles are bullet proof?  Seriously?  MUTANT NINJAS!

In summary, watching this movie made me feel bad about myself and question my life choices.",1444176000,,1180,4.639423076923077

Watching this movie was like watching Saturday cartoons again only with better graphics and bigger action. The CG on this film was phenomenal.

6325915,3,B00J2T18XS,"Spoiler Alert:
I was very skeptical about this movie when I heard that Michael Bay and Megan Fox was involved. But I'm glad I gave it a shot. The turtles' personas are real close to the classic cartoons; so are Shredder's and Splinter's. The story line was a bit weak but I can forgive that since it was probably geared more towards kids. I took one star away because Megan Fox was awful in this movie (as she is in all of her films) and another one because of how she knew the turtles before they mutated. Bay didn't overload this with too many unnecessary explosions and overall did well with a few exceptions (ex. the scene while falling down the mountain was a good 5 minutes too long).
Overall, I enjoyed this movie. I won't be buying it on blu-ray like I did the past 4 but I'm glad it's on Prime.",1444003200,,803,4.254901960784314

I actually expected it to suck after reading so many bad reviews. That being said, I really, really liked this movie. The plot was well laid and well played. The characters were fleshed out and fun to get to know. The chick was a great tool for laying the foundation, getting the story started, introducing the bad guys and good guys, and tying them all together. The turtles themselves were believable, fun, awesome and tough (I totally want them as friends, now). The fighting scenes were well done and the CGI was good.
Over all, don't walk into this movie expecting a Joss Whedon epic. You'll be disappointed. And don't expect all the fighting to be Ray Parks Perfection. You'll also be disappointed. And don't walk into this movie expecting the original Ninja Turtles...... I have a feeling lots of people are already disappointed on that front.

Other than the turtles looking like the turtles I remember from the cartoons in high-res, this movie bore no semblance to what I remember of the older TMNT cartoon or even the older 90s movie. Maybe I'm being too harsh because I am now a 22 year old trying to get kicks out of a TMNT movie but man oh man if you're over 12 and like a story to go with the good looking CG, you will find it hard, very hard to sit through the movie in it's entirety.

6326005,4,B00J2T18XS,"Ok, it's not going to win any best picture nominations but this is for a younger crowd that like action, silliness and juvenile humor (ok, male juvenile humor)  which the other Turtle movies focused on too. It's no different now, so those who loved the originals should remember how silly they were too and lighten up. These types of movies are for fun and fantasy, not art and classics. This was good enough for a good time.

Also, considering the story line, I'm glad it focused on April O'Neil and that Megan Fox was given more to do than just be in a movie for her good looks and sex appeal. She did a good job and carried the film, in my opinion, which was a pleasant surprise. This movie shows she's got more talent than she's given credit for and she displayed a surprising humorous side as well. Along with Wil Arnett's own touch of irony and Whoopi Goldberg's contribution, it was overall a fun movie. It wasn't all about turtles and a rat fighting evil.

Although the story was predictable in many spots, that's the way these movies are made, so I wasn't expecting much but I didn't expect much from the originals either. However, this one added more to the story, so I'm giving it the 4 stars because of that and for all of us who still like movies to just chill out and have fun with.",1443398400,,1296,4.369294605809128

***May Contain Some Movie Spoiler Review Content***

Just watched this, I was very wary of it because of the rumors that came out during production and expected it to be much more horrible than it really was. I was pleasantly surprised for the most part.

I was a fan of the turtles growing up. Watched the originals along side other cartoons so they're very much a part of my child hood including the original movies. I enjoyed the cast for the most part but I do agree the movie focused a little much on April O'Neil. I realize for this version there needed to be backstory; however, the focus could have been more evenly divided in the fore-story so that the turtles are seen sooner rather than after a stint in the movie. At the very least there could have been some antics like in the old movies of them ordering pizza or something.

The movie was def. filled with plenty of action. There's parts of the movie I don't agree in whole with considering the turtles I remember never really had super strength. Minor detail though in the whole of the picture. I loved the nods back to the originals with the turtle van and comments of hero in a half shell.

The CG was fairly well done during the movie itself, Micheal Bay does at least have experience providing very decent and almost realistic styled CG considering the other movies he's produced. However, I still prefer the original design and costumes made from latex and the robotics of the old movies.

There's one main issue I have is a few times where there were camera wobbles and movement that made it feel like you were right there with the character. I actually fairly have a large distaste for this style of shooting film because it feels so cheap and can easily make a person motion sick if over done. Had these shots been made to look like they were another camera - like that of a film crew or some such it would've felt better to me but clearly there's places they trimmed the budget or tried a little too hard.

Over all ignoring my pop-culture original turtles fan side I say the movie is fairly decent despite it's dubious back history and is at the very least a watch once movie - unless you're an action buff then totally worth the money to buy the dvd/blu-ray for you're action collection!

After all I was pleasantly surprised with how decent it was! They are Mutants and Not Aliens and I wholly approve of that!",1443312000,,2575,4.429175475687104

6326039,5,B00J2T18XS,I'm not quite sure why so many didn't like this movie. It was a good set up to the beginnings of the teenage mutant ninja turtles. It's was funny and exciting. I thought it was very good and I grew up with the tmnt cartoon and movies. And one of my favorite aspects about the movie ( slight spoiler)............you get to see splinter fight and kick some butt. The movie was a lot of fun and I highly enjoyed it. Can't wait for part two to come out for it will be featuring Casey jones in it.,1443225600,,492,4.082474226804123

6326044,2,B00J2T18XS,"TPTB behind this movie were trying way too hard. As campy as the originals were, I felt that it was better because I felt like they were just trying to make a fun comedic movie, not do everything they could do and throw in everything but the kitchen sink to try to create some epic uber dramatic blockbuster. It wasn't horrible, although at times Megan Fox was and the guy playing Sachs was not at all believable as a scientist...just a loon. Shredder was just....meh. I feel like if I didn't watch it, I wouldn't have been missing anything... And there's two more coming down the pipeline??",1443225600,2,591,4.5327102803738315

But what I managed to watch was as much of an insult to a legacy as inherently ridiculous as the mere concept of mutant reptile youths with Kung Fu skills can be. The turtles' facial redesign was disturbing, but not nearly as jarring to the sensibilities as the horrendous dialogue and the leading lady's eye-rollingly poor delivery. It had all the soul and humor of a rock that a 12-year-old used as a prop in a fart joke. I gave it an extra star for a rather cool comic book-stylized opening scene, but it was all downhill from there.

Anyways... The movie contains that crude humor that would normally be said by teenagers, hence ""Teenage."" Lots and lots of CGI to the point it almost seems fake. but again, why look for realism and logic in a movie about giant talking warrior turtles.

The best part of the movie is that it brings the comic book and cartoon characters into a semi-interesting and semi-believable world.

6326268,2,B00J2T18XS,"Utterly mindless entertainment with far too much CGI than the brain can keep up with. Two stars simply because its fun bubblegum but you can feel the sizzling death of brain cells as you follow the ridiculous story, endless explosions and atrocious acting. I felt they kept this fairly close to the spirit of the cartoon, albeit a little more gritty, urban and violent. The CG isn't bad, but it suffers from Jar Jar syndrome in that when humans interact with the CG turtles it just doesn't look right. Megan Fox already has a vacant expression so this is only amplified when she's looking at a computer-rendered mouse that you know isn't there in the scene with her. The film gets to the point where you just have to stop trying to rationalize the plausibility of anything and just watch the flashy colors and noises placidly.",1443052800,,826,4.664383561643835
6326269,3,B00J2T18XS,"This isn't the Turtles I grew up watching/reading... I'm not saying its bad... Its just different. The looks of the Turtles have always changed, I loved the 1980's cartoons Turtles cause the Cheese was just fun compared to the actual Dark Story/visuals The Turtles were meant to be. This one does take a Darker tone but honestly it was misplaced and unfitting at some parts.

Story is just bland.

Honestly This movie could have been so much better. Its a one time watch really.. I already forgot about this movie....

.... The Shredder?!.... Really?!

If its Free.. It's okay to watch.

6326274,3,B00J2T18XS,As someone born in 1987 and grew up on TMNT this was better than expected. Not great but good. Turtles and Splinter look a bit different but I enjoyed it all the same. It's a cartoon there was enough there to keep me entertained for 1.5 hours.,1442966400,,243,4.191489361702128

Not to mention the horrible CGI that makes everything look like it's from a different, somehow worse, movie. If you are a fan of either the Cartoon Series (any of them) and/or the Original film, STAY AWAY from this. It will make you HATE the Turtle, hate April O'Neil (with Megan Fox playing her, it's already a lost cause), and wonder what the heck happened with Shredder and how it went all bad.

It was not as dark and gritty as I had thought it was going to be, which was good. It had a lot of fun humor and references to previous TMNT media. The story focused the most of Megan Fox's character (April) and her story rather than the turtles, but it was okay.

6326546,1,B00J2T18XS,"i was a huge fan of the 1990s cartoon but never saw any of the live action versions or read the comics.  After watching the movie, I don't think the writers, producers, or director even saw the cartoon.

If they existed, I think Donatello and Michelangelo would sue for defamation.  Donatello was turned from the smart but fun one to a dweeb and Michelangelo was turned from a surfer dude to a black guy or at least a white poser (considering the turtles are full siblings, this is not possible).  Shredder looks OK but it's blatantly obvious he was actually meant to be someone else and the movie makes much more sense if the other person was Shredder. Megan Fox serves as mildly perturbed set dressing and keeps creating situations she needs to be rescued from - not exactly a girl power message.  And Will Arnett comes along for the ride as a seriously creepy camera man who is never seen with a camera. William Fincher is actually pretty good but everyone else is so bad that I felt sorry for him for having to say stupid lines with people phoning in their performances. Tony Shalhoub is totally wrong as splinter and comes off as Tony Shalhoub doing a Japanese guy impression - which is offensive.

The relationship between April and the turtles is also super creepy.  They're supposedly her former pets that she ""saved"" by putting in the sewer (animal cruelty?) but a couple have a crush on her.  I couldn't decide if that makes it incest or beastiality but either way it's wrong.

Next Shredder is cross between a Megatron and an Samurai warrior. This movie was so bad that I stopped watching (and let it continue playing) just to check who the voice actors were. Also why the f is Donatello such a wuss in this movie? Aside from the horrible acting, which I really don't expect much just play the part, the story being completely redone, the villain's (the foot being terrorists and not even trained in martial arts), not an ounce of martial arts in the movie except when fighting Megatron (I mean Shredder except for the slow mo transformer sound effects)... this movie wasn't even entertaining. This is the worst movie I've seen in a long time, worse than GI JOE retaliation. It didn't even feel like a movie it felt like an episode, no story just scenes. They took martial arts out almost entirely and replaced it with roids and superhuman strength and bullet proof turtle shells???!!!! If this is what the new generation likes... umm no they didn't and good. RottenTomatoes 1 star, Imdb 3 stars out of five. DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO WASTE 1hr 41mins. Who wrote this s***? The director should be run out of town and Micheal Bay shouldn't be able to touch another Turtle Movie for at least 20years. He should think of it as the sun. He can't even look at the concept of doing another TMNT movie. If this is what the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles are gonna be like from now on then shoot them all in the head and make sure Splinter, April O'neil, and Shredder are all directly behind them so as not to waste bullets. I love the turtles. I'm an 80s baby. I gave the new story a chance and now I gotta find another movie to wash the taste of that $125 million piece of crap from my mouth. It's like someone literally held open my eyes for 1hr 41 mins and s*** $125 million dollars worth of s***, actual s***, on my face.

My problem isn't in alternations to origin stories or interpretations of characters, but just quality.  Given the mountain of source material they had to work with, I cant believe they couldn't come up with something better.  It was like watching M.

I understand the need for a refresh and a twist on the show but the characters as well as the story line is poorly reenacted. Shredder looks awful and overly hyped as the villain so this movie was mediocre and sub par at best. My two cents: Megan Fox can not act and does not have a career in the movie industry...

I know it's a ""child's movie"" but it doesn't mean it's exempt from being good. I can't recommend it, I watched the movie with my kiddo - who promptly fell asleep within the first twenty minutes so even as a kid's movie - it couldn't keep her engaged. The action scenes were long, and after a few minutes became a little boring.

The movie has a lot of dry/deadpan humor and a little, but not enough, kiddie hi-jinks. I thought Arnell and Fox were good human leads and Fichtner was a serviceable baddie.

The cinematography was very nice and the action sequences were well choreographed. The turtles looked much brighter and kid friendly in the daytime scenes.

I disliked the Transformers inspired EDM sound effects-- very distracting. I also wish that the movie would have had more kid friendly wonder (like the elevator scene).

This is quite the troublesome affliction, since everything in his life revolves around this. He started with The Nightmare Before Christmas. That night lasted 6 months. Action figures, pajamas, youtube playlists consisting of Halloween themed sounds. 24. 7.

He then spent a few months obsessed about Spiderman and, now, he's currently obsessed with our shelled heroes. Which means action figures, shell backpacks, stickers, pajamas. What a boy, eh! But what time. Except... when you have to watch this movie more than a dozen times.

I have to say that after about a dozen viewings you begin to see some of the granular film making decisions Michael made. My current verdict: Not horrible if you must watch. Just don't expect it to be Reservoir Dogs.",1441756800,,865,4.951724137931034

My wife and I just got done viewing this, and honestly found more entertainment making fun of it (a la Mystery Science Theater 3000 style) than watching it at face value. I feel the movie suffers, ultimately, from trying too hard to be like everything else lately. It seems that Michael Bay is simply trying to capitalize on his personal stylization of graphics + action x explosions = success, and to be perfectly frank, it really gives a very shallow portrayal of who and what the Ninja Turtles are. If you look at the old cartoon, it was neither super fast paced, nor was it fully action-packed; much of what made the original Turtles so endearing was their personalities. It was their good-natured humor amidst the battle that was focused on, not the battle itself. It was the dialog, and the characters, that drove the original series and made it so well-liked. A strong majority of that was lacking in this movie, though there were a few snippets where the director/producer tried to inject it during what would otherwise be filler scenes. I think if the filmmakers would have taken a step back during filmmaking, intentionally slowed the story down a bit and focused wider-angle shots instead of a series of close-ups, the movie would have naturally progressed more by character and story development... and been better. Instead, we're left with a movie that's a little too Batman (Dark Knight), and not enough Turtles. Although there were a few scenes that I thought were humorous or fun, my wife and I finished the movie only to see how it wrapped up. The credits came, we shrugged, and she expressed that she wanted nothing more than to watch the old 90s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, because it had more soul AND a better story.",1441670400,3,1983,4.798245614035087

Will Arnett as a cameraman? Perhaps.
Tohoru Masamune as Shredder, yeah OK. Works for me.

It didn't feel like ""CHILDHOOD RUINED"" to me in the slightest. So, take a chill pill and give it a chance. And no, I'm not a fan of Michael Bay.

6326866,4,B00J2T18XS,"...it started out kind of corney and very slow. It seemed to be going nowhere fast, and  I nearly stopped watching after the first five minutes. Gradually, it became more interesting and I continued. All in all, it wasn't bad. In all fairness, TMNT is based on cartoon characters, so if you're expecting ""Grapes of Wrath,"" don't bother. The Turtles-and-Master characters are adorable and very well-defined. The cinematography, set, wardrobe/costumes, and technical aspects of the film are top quality. While the script is mediocre, Director Jonathan Liebesman does well with what he was given to work. I must say Will Arnett, (""Vernon"") IS THE GLUE that holds all things protagonistic together. Arnett is what I like to call ""The Movie Saver."" Were it not for him, I'm not so sure how far down into the pits this film would have fallen. The Woodburn-Shalhoub combo (""Splinter') blends very well as a worthy opponent against the more than capable villains, William Fitchner (""Sacks"") and Tohoru Masamume (""Shredder"").  Megan Fox-- as beautiful as she is-- is no Meryl Streep, but she her efforts are sincere, making ""April O'Neal"" a likable heroine. If you can watch TMNT with a less-than-adult eye, it just might appeal to the ""kid"" in you-- it did for me.",1441670400,2,1256,4.976190476190476

I've never had such a visceral reaction to a movie, I just found myself uncontrollably swearing after I turned it off. I accept that the popular culture Ninja Turtles will never resemble Eastman and Laird's original creation because it doesn't sell toys, and I can accept the comedic iteration that existed in the cartoons and Archie comics. But they ruined the origin story that even the cartoons got mostly right, and the product placement in this movie is just obscene. They don't even try to mask it any more. Further proof that anything with the stink of Michael Bay on it is inevitably going to be garbage. I hate to say it, but I would run Jonathan Liebesman over with my car if I saw him crossing the street. Him and M. Night Shyamalan.

April is written as a useless character and shouldn't have been the focus of the movie. Megan Fox's acting is... Megan Fox's acting. The fight scenes are convoluted. Splinter was voiced well and actually I think Shredder was well cast, but the character is just not at all developed. Why is he hell bent on taking over New York? No one knows, but he's wearing a cool ninja robot suit and that's what matters, apparently.

6327105,3,B00J2T18XS,"Whoa where to start where to start on this one,ok at first when i saw the Trailer and saw that April did not have Red hair as the original and that the Turtles was much larger than original I was not big on that idea but i kept an open mind going into the movie and I think they pulled off that aspect ok. I think the movie is solid for the first hour except for lacking in identifying with each character I think an introduction by Splinter of each character and their specialties etc to April would have been good. Part that rubbed me the wrong way the most was the Semi scene at around the 1:09 to 1:11 hour mark in the movie and the lack of detail in the part,This guy hops in a Semi is like I can drive this as if anyone can drive a semi and starts driving without releasing the Brakes and Slamming in to high gears when first starting off and doing on snow. The Air Brake buttons are not released you can still see them popped out and the shadow off of them is high and also if you pause in different parts during that scene you can see the Guages are bottomed out at zero all of them. Finally when he spins the semi around you can see he only has a blue airline hooked up,anyone with ample experience driving a semi can tell you that a red air line is minimum that needs to be hooked up it is possible to use a different color line in its place but that is doubtful here. Part of what separates Great movies from others is the attention to detail in my mind. Finally at the end they thank her for not telling anyone the secret of them and she accepts as if she never said a word during the first part of movie she was trying to tell anyone and everyone about them what a joke. However overall I think Megan was better in her role than I expected and I think the Turtles design was well done. Taking in account the good and bad I give it 3 Stars and think it is worth a 1 time watch.",1441411200,4,1889,4.0

At least Megan fox, as usual, is also a joke.  There couldn't possibly be a worse combination of horrid actors, horribly offensive content, and an absurd change to the TMNT story.

6327116,4,B00J2T18XS,"This is not a good movie in the typical sense. It is generic, cliche, short, and full of Michael Bay-ness. With that said, however, I can say it is fun to watch. Skip about the first 30 minutes to get past the April slog because once the Turtles come in, the move takes off and doesn't let up. The action is loud and fun and non-stop. More importantly, you can tell what is going on during the actions scenes. You know how in Transformers, the action was fast, loud, and full of particle effects and quick cuts which made it hard to follow who was who. Turtles has all that, but the characters are unique enough to follow during the heavy action scenes. The best part of the whole movie is probably the personalities. I feel they really got the teeange part right. Sure, sometimes the lines are a little crude and cringe worthy, but it is all stuff an actual teenager would say.

If you are a die hard turtle fan that is not open to different interpretations to the turtles, just skip this movie. But if you can shut your brain off and enjoy the ride, the move is at least entertaining. Plus, it is only an hour and half, so if you hate it, it won't last long.",1441411200,,1160,4.248868778280543

And although the turtles faces take some getting used too, (sadly I never did), I did love the fact that they are all different, and not just in personality but height and build. This is something that has not been done before, but sadly it was not enough to overcome the acting...which I am at a loss for some of these actors just being...just bad.

Characters are ridiculously connected in some of the most convoluted ways for no reason other than to change the source material.

Watch the original movie or read the comics your time will be better spent.

There are some funny moments, fight scenes are ripped from the transformers movies and Shredder is now basically a transformer. Also the turtles now possess super human strength yeah this isn't what older fans grew up on.

Also Johnny Knoxville is a bad choice for Leonardo's voice. The rest of the voice overs were forgettable at best and came across as characterizations not characters.

Last thought on the film - There is not one character I could remotely have cared what happened too. The turtles could've all died and wouldn't have cared.",1441324800,,893,4.7727272727272725

6327251,3,B00J2T18XS,"I'll be honest, this is my first Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles experience. I've never seen the show, cartoon, previous movies, etc. This is the first time that I've ever actually watched anything TMNT related. So with that being said this strongly reminded me of movies from the mid-late 2000s. The writing, the directing, the lens flares, jump scares, and overall acting just remind me of the time around when the original Transformers, Spider-Man, and Iron Man came out.

The turtles weren't really the main focus it seemed. It really focused on Megan Fox's character and let's be honest, her acting is kind of stale. I felt like she really overacted most of the time. In the movie her boss says that she's crazy and I think Fox played the crazy part a little too much. I just couldn't like her character and I felt she went a little overboard with the craziness, i.e. when she's trying to convince people that these turtles exist. It was weird seeing Will Arnett in such a ""serious"" role. I usually see him with a smile on his face and cracking jokes but he wasn't making any jokes in the movie nor was he smiling much.

The overall way the movie was filmed was kind of weird. Some shots were filmed at angles while other shots had a lot of lens flares going on. There were a couple of jump scares(too many if you ask me) and there was some intense emotional scenes. It's like the movie didn't know what genre it was supposed to be in. I felt like this movie came out at least 5 years ago instead of recently. The CGI wasn't bad for the most part but the turtles were kind of creepy and extremely buff.

I'm giving this a 3 out of 5 because I didn't think it was THAT bad but it was boring at times and too serious. It was entertaining at times but not entertaining enough for me to watch it again. As I write this review this movie streams with Amazon Prime and that's the only reason why I saw it. I would have felt bad if I actually had to pay to rent it. I just don't feel like it was a movie about Ninja Turtles. It was a movie about a girl trying to convince everyone that there were live talking ninja turtles which is funny because I don't even think Megan Fox is on the movie poster.",1441238400,5,2194,4.294685990338165

6327315,2,B00J2T18XS,I would give this movie almost 3 stars for effort.  Megan Fox gets alot of crap and I want to make this clear that I have nothing personal about any of the actresses or actors in the movie.  To me the movie was forgettable.  There was something magical (probably the absence of Jim Henson) about the first two T.m.n.t that is not obtainable with CGI.  I am not a huge CGI hater or anything but you may as well just make a decent tmnt cartoon .  Maybe I don't like how the new generations of tmnt look since Nickelodeon got involved.  I like Nickelodeon but hate what they did to tmnt.  I saw this in the theatre because I saw the first 3 in the theatre over 20 yrs. ago.  I wasn't utterly dissapointed or anything The movie to me was not very enjoyable when I know there are 3 movies that are better.,1441238400,8,800,4.14935064935065

Peculiar action shots for nothing in particular and close ups that make you feel like the characters can rummage through your pockets. The movie was just a monotonous bore lacking any human emotion.

There were so few jokes, the turtles were made to look like scary ripped warriors and I only heard cowabunga once in the movie?? There were so few of the funny moments that made these movies great.

And there were some terrible choices for who voiced characters such as Splinter, but most of all I can't BELIEVE it took so long for us to even see the turtles. I did not enjoy April's incredibly stupid portrayal in this movie, and I enjoyed only seeing her for the first part of the movie even less. This isn't about April it's about the Turtles!!!

Never mind them being damn bullet proof hulks who could never fit down a manhole.  Nevermind 3 different actors playing Shredder, none of which served any purpose whatsoever in this movie.  Never mind the ridiculousness of April naming them. Never mind the rat's prehensile tale or the Pizza Hut ad.  It's the fact that it was just an awful movie.  How many snow-covered mountains are near New York city? How many liters of blood can a 9 ft turtle lose and not replenish after being drained?  Why is Will Arnett even in the movie?  Ugh ugh and ugh.  Now granted, I'm not 7 anymore, but I am a TMNT junkie.  I was very excited for this film and tried my best to pretend I had never heard of them before watching it.  Then I imagine a 7 year old watching it for the very first time and raising all the same questions.  The Nickelodeon series is fantastic, and they had their target audience right there!  To present them with anger fueled, hunch backed lizard people, was just baffling to me.  They could have just used the story from season 1 and made an incredible film.  But that's just my opinion.

If you are looking for a con though I would say that the plot kind of steam rolls and gets a little crazy but some how maintains a relationship with the viewers and the characters.

This newest movie with Megan Fox captures the spirit of the original TV program better than any other Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles movie ever has.  And that is why I'm giving it 5 stars.  Because I'm a long time fan of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and became a lifetime fan because the first TV program back in 1987.  If anyone disagrees with me, because the movie is not that good, they think, I don't Care.  I believe that this is the best representation of the original TV show, and is very well executed technically.  Plus the main characters the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles themselves are more accurately portrayed than they ever have been before, and that is what is magical for me.

Therefore, I'd like to say that I did enjoy the movie for what it presented.  The turtles were portrayed as a close knit group of teens in their actions, expressions and adventuring tools.  And I enjoyed the time with Megan Fox (as always) she works well here as in Transformers where she's interacting with animated characters (they could've been onset actors dressed similar to the figures which will be painstakenly rendered and pixelized in the labs after shooting for all I know).  But the story looked good from my point of view - it showed the streets of New York City overshadowed by the elusive Foot Clan and eventually lead to a tie in with April O'Neil's (Megan Fox) father and his involvement with Eric Sacks (William Fitchner) in their scientific research.",1441065600,,941,4.826086956521739

IT must be to do with this anglo-crap. How come you never see decent black actors. Racism. Anyways this movie is total crap like the rest of white america's s*** films.

The turtles move in a way that is very reptilian but also very clunky and un-ninja like.  There are also really big holes in the plot line.  It should have been better.",1441065600,,361,4.424242424242424

6327583,3,B00J2T18XS,"Definitely a Michael Bay movie with amazing action sequences and camera angles that is Michael's trademark as much as his action scenes.  The story is well paced while April O'Neil seems underdeveloped - we see a roommate a couple of times but I think it is more of an attempt at comedy relief than anything else (which is a little overkill since April's cameraman - Vern - is blatantly pushed to the audience as ""funny"").  Toss out the origins you have seen in other TMNT movies/shows/comics.  Without giving away the origin that was used here, it was a nice/kind way to incorporate April into this iteration of the TMNT.  While I understand that CGI is leading the way in films, I still miss the live/interactive maquettes/suits from the initial TMNT films.  As for the look for the turtles in this film, most people will either love/hate it.  I am still scratching my head with Donatello wearing glasses, I get it as a means of differentiating the character but being that they depict no clear means of keeping them in place for all of the fight scenes/etc.  If you are a fan of the TMNT, I would recommend renting this but as far as owning, it departs too much for me.",1441065600,,1172,4.552380952380952

On one hand, the CGI made the characters look very real, and the action was on par with an adult action flick, but the crude humor was geared more toward 10-14 year olds, it seems. The storyline also seemed more geared toward adults, with the shredder trying to commit mass murder with a biological weapon.

6327676,3,B00J2T18XS,"Now before I begin this review let me clear the fact that this MOVIE is aiming for the new younger audience. This movie is not focusing on aiming for the fans of the past generation. So lets look at it this way.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is directed by Jonathan Liebsman and Produced by Michael Bay. It stars Megan Fox as April O'Neil, and 4 turtles who don't look that good with the CGI. With this kind of set up, its already predictable that this would be a disaster.

As I watched this movie in a theater packed with a tremendous amount of children. I guess I could say, this movie was entertaining for me. The stars of the movie are, hands down the Turtles especially Mikey. They stole the movie in every scene they were in, and I would watch a 1 hour movie with just all of them goofing around and making jokes. However, in fact the movie often negates the fact that the turtles are the main subject in this movie, it circles it's story mostly around April O'Neil. As for her character, I found her annoying at many times. And because Michael Bay has something to do with this movie, Megan Fox had to do scenes for the ""benefit' of Bay as usual. Going back to the turtles, I think that they had nailed them and captured everything that we loved about them, the movie is worth watching because of them. The Villains are one of the weak points of this film. Shredder is a very dull, boring and predictable villain. He is only there for what I believe is fan service. Other than that, his motives are unclear and the reason he is in this movie is for the battle scenes.

As for the story, it is filled with unbelievable amounts of clich. Because of this, I had no choice but to be irritated at times or sometimes these scenes gave no effect to me whatsoever even if the main intention of the scene was entirely different. The evil plot of the villain, was downright cringe worthy, plot holes were circling from there and there. . Clichs and plot holes aside, the story is what I would imagine for children and all of us were to look it that way, then I guess I could say the plot was alright I guess. The action sequences were just OK, there were some that were interesting and some that was incredibly DIFFICULT to watch. I know Michael Bay didn't direct this, but My God. Every Michael Bay action-clich is in this movie. The Slow Motion, Explosions, Attractive Women and the incredibly shaky camera. I almost felt dizzy watching some of the action sequences.

At the end of the day, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is a great movie to watch if you want bonding times with your kids or if you're totally high or craving for some pizza. In my opinion, it won't ruin your childhood, in fact it might even remind and bring back old memories of your childhood, with the many references being made in this movie. The kids will love this movie and I recommend everyone to bring pizza while watching it.

A dull and boring villain, a mediocre plot filled with a massive amount of clichs and Michael Bay style action sequences. without the Turtles, this movie would be pure trash.",1440979200,,3076,4.417989417989418

Funny? Eh. It's so bad I can't say I didn't notice, but like others say, it's talking turtles, how real or serious do our human actors really need to be for us to sit through it to see our turtles kick ass? *cough* Transformers *cough*.

6327734,1,B00J2T18XS,"I grew up loving the turtles, so it's hard for me to untangle my reaction to this movie as a movie from my childhood love for the property.  But even when I do my level best to be unbiased, this is a bad, bad movie.  The CGI was so over the top it was distracting. The constant forced references to the original property never felt natural or organic, flowing from the action.  Instead, each was a jarring reminder that ""hey look, we're part of a long-running franchise"".  Megan Fox's acting was cringe-worthy at best, the action sequences felt like a video-game, the dialog was atrocious, etc.

I know I'm really not the target audience for this, my 10 year old kid who'd never been exposed to the turtles before loved the film, and it made a boatload of money, but we watched this ""for free"" on Prime and I definitely feel that I overpaid.

The movie makes no sense, even in a context where we accept human sized turtles as plausible.  Every element of the plot is contrived or complete non-sense.

Disney proves that one can make a movie for 9 year-olds without making it as if one were a 9 year-old.  I didn't watch this in theaters.

I don't get the hate on this movie at all. No, it's not Oscar worthy. It's a movie with CGI ninja turtles battling forces of evil based on a 1990's cartoon. You should not be expecting Citizen Kane here.

Yes, the plot is kind of generic. Who cares? This isn't about the story. It's about the witty banter between giant turtles and the excitement of seeing a live action version of a childhood favorite that doesn't look like 4 guys in rubber suits like the original live action TMNT movies. It succeeds in that endeavor.

The CGI on the turtles is very good. They look real....you know....as real as a 6 foot bipedal talking turtle can look. They have fluid motion and realistic movement. The CGI on Splinter was kind of crummy though. He looks like a cartoon.",1440806400,,812,4.436241610738255

6327766,1,B00J2T18XS,"This is a perfect example of a movie that was written in a corporate boardroom. A bunch of MBA wallstreet types sat around a long table and took turns blurting out the worst idea they could think off. I got an idea how about ""99 cheese pizza"". ""Great idea, lets put some childish fart jokes in it too and also a flying skateboard."" The flying skateboard may have worked in the cartoon but it doesn't work in a live action movie. It made the movie way over the top cheesy. The beatboxing in the elevator and making the turtles racist stereotypes of black people were terrible decisions. They tried to make the turtles into parodies of Cash Money / Young Money artists like Lil Wayne, Drake, Tyga, and all the other losers on that label that can't rap. The turtles are also supposed to be 4 feet tall and not giant bulky turtles. They're supposed to be ninjas that move swiftly like a cat not an giant bulky elephant making a lot of noise while stampeding through the fields. Making the turtles giant and bulky is the complete opposite of being a NINJA. And the worst part of all.... Donatello's hipster glasses and his giant ghost busters backpack. And Karai's hair looks like a cheap halloween wig. This movie had a budget of $125 million and they couldn't even bother to get a realistic looking wig. The casting is beyond ridiculous. Megan Fox? Will Arnett? Whoopi Goldberg? Sounds like the cast for a SNL TMNT parody. All of these terrible ideas were born in a corporate boardroom meeting at Paramount Studios.

When the movies came out they were corny, but the charters and actors were the same as the original cartoon. This movie is NOT even close. the turtles don't sound or act like the original teenage ninja brats. April in the original cartoon us a redhead. Splinter don't sound like the way Splinter is supposedto sound. The only true to the original is Shredder who has that deep, gruff oriental voice.

Why do these directors try to redo  movies and get change from the original?

6327771,4,B00J2T18XS,"So I just watched it on prime...and it I have to say it wasn't too bad. Sure, it wasn't Shakespeare by any stretch of the imagine, all the same though, it was entertaining, and for a movie starring colossal CGI walking talking turtles jumping around subduing foot clan cronies with style, I can't fault it on that level. However, the acting was a bit poor, and some scenes were a little cheesy. It was still fun though. Maybe not as good as let's say the original TMNT movie, the 2003 series, the animated feature that came out 8 years ago in 2007, or even the current animated cgi series on nickelodeon, although that is admittedly not a movie; it's a TV show that I would like to persuade everyone, fan or not, to check out (again, it's on nickelodeon, so give it a try).

Some high points, the voices were top notch for the turtles, and they had plenty of personality, which is almost mandatory for a turtles film or series. I also appreciate that one of the main themes was ""family,"" because that is always that basis of a good turtle story. Shredder was also, in my opinion, quite intimidating in this movie, and a worthy interpretation of the character just by on-screen presence alone. The complicated and sometimes complex backstory of Shredder's past with master Splinter was scrapped for the sake of time, and it was obvious for anyone versed in turtles lore, and that may piss some fans off, but the intense action scenes, humor and charm made up for a lack of interesting backstory and character development. One thing this film nailed down was how Splinter raised the turtles as sons, and the dynamic I appreciated the most and its inclusion towards the all important main theme: family, which helped the film escape being a total time waster. I also like the little rap song during the credits near the end, and it reminds me of the current intro for the ongoing turtles animated series on nickelodeon (Seriously, what are you still doing here? Go watch it.)

If you've watched the very original cartoon from the 80's, the movies from the 90's, even the notoriously slammed Saban's Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation, the animated series from 2003, the animated movie from 2007, the current series on nickelodeon that aired in 2012 -- the year the world was supposed to end, and finally this movie, then I would highly recommend IDW's current slate of TMNT comics by tom waltz, and as of now, it is currently 11 volumes in -- the 12th will be released on October 22nd. If you call yourself a turtles fan, then get off your tush and check it out. Yeah I know most people hate reading, but, you know, it's worth the time; it's worth YOUR time.

So, all in all, I think  this film stands on its own. It's not your typical turtles film, it's something different, so that may be why so many people hate it. 4 stars.

Pros:
- Prevalent family theme
- Charming turtles

Negatives:
- No inclusion of the long storied relationship/history between Shredder and Splinter
- Flat acting, although Vernon (Will Arnett) was okay.

 The opening made me think I was watching someone play Fruit Ninja.
 The animation is stiffer than the 2007 TMNT CGI feature.
 The voices don't match the bodies/characters (and the lipsync is off at times).
 The Americanization, for lack of a better termI know it's an American property, (Foot Clan turned into a CoD-inspired SWAT team, evil business man at the heart of the criminal empire) is unnecessary & only weakens the story.
 The product placement is in your face at all times. Splinter did a full 30 second Pizza Hut spot right in the middle of the movie.
 The writers worked WAY too hard to get every cliche line of TMNT reference into the dialog.
 The guest appearance by Silver Samurai/Swiss Army Samurai was complete crap.
 Creeper Vernon constantly trying to get into April's pants got old in their first sceneso of course it carried on throughout the entire film.
 Of course the villain has to reveal his entire plan to the captured hero, Bond villain style.
 Gratuitous butt-shotit is a Megan Fox movie afterall.

6327888,3,B00J2T18XS,"""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is a reboot of the TMNT franchise that was was overall fairly enjoyable but will likely miss the mark with younger viewers or die-hard fans of the originals.

Much of the focus and camera time was given to April (Megan Fox) and the action is well paced, but the chemistry between the turtle brothers really wasn't captured as well as in the comics or in the first set of movies.

This is certainly watchable but not very memorable.

This newest rendition of the Turtles meets today's technology in cinema.... CGI. The CGI in this film is so ""cartoony"", I would rather being watching a cartoon.  That aside. I am willing to forgive the CG characters... but the story? Horrendous! When I watched this film I got the sneaky suspicion that all the attention was given to the mediocre visual effects rather than an actual enjoyable story. It was so rushed. This seems to be the way of many films nowadays and sadly TMNT fell victim to it as well and fans were forced to watch this mess of a movie. Hopefully the sequel is improved.... but when you realize that your childhood-cartoons-gone-Hollywood (Transformers, GI Joe, etc) and their many sequels have failed you time and again.... it is very unlikely.

This movie was overly cheesy with atrocious acting and jokes that never landed. Mikey made me laugh a few times and I love the elevator beatbox scene but over all this movie tried SO hard to be funny and cool and it fell flat. Megan Fox is the furthest from a believable actress and she doesn't fit the April we've seen and grown up with from the original cartoons and movies.

It doesn't have the same spirit and feeling that the original movies had; it feels like the just sloppily wrote a script together so that they could justify using all of the special effects and CGI.

Megan Fox was a surprisingly decent April O'Neil, and I actually thought she tried to be believable as the turtles' only real human friend.  Splinter was insufferable; he sounded more like a 5th turtle than their sensei.  Shredder was completely ridiculous and was in no way as terrifying and villainous as the original Shredder in the movies.  The fight between Shredder and Splinter wasn't too bad, but it could have been a lot better.  What's even worse, I just read that there will be a sequel soon!",1432857600,,841,4.726027397260274

  The theme of the story is generally the same as the original with some minor changes, and the actor from ""Blackhawk Down"" and ""Dark Knight"" plays the associate villain who is working with Shredder.  I just could not get into just how super buff these Ninja Turtles were, and the constant CGI had taken away some of the cooler elements of the first Ninja Turtles movie by ""New Line Cinema"" where men in suits along with puppetry from Jim Henson's studio had been involved.

6328041,3,B00J2T18XS,"I keep seeing people bash every single thing about this movie, and I can't help but think they are blinded by Michael Bay's name being involved that they are incapable of being unbiased.

Let's be honest, this movie is just like the original Ninja Turtles movie. Everything else sucks, but when the Ninja Turtles are on screen it's awesome. Just like the original, you don't care about April's problems when she's away from the turtles, and you don't care about the other human characters. The plus side is that unlike the original, this one didn't give us a lame ""troubled youth being reunited with his father"" crap.

The turtles were awesome. They were funny, and their action scenes were great. Each turtle's individual personalities were the way they were supposed to be. Do I wish they had looked more like their comic and cartoon counterparts? Sure. But it looks like they were really playing up the ""mutant"" part of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. So it is what it is.

Megan Fox wasn't as bad as April as I thought she'd be. Frankly, she was just as good as the other two live action April's. I didn't care about her version just like I didn't care about the others.

Shredder was awesome in the movie, even though him basically being Iron Shredder did make me roll my eyes a little.

The movie was fun, the action was great, the humor worked with the turtles, and I can't wait for the second one. It was just like the original in my eyes. I was only interested in what the Turtles were doing, and couldn't get invested in the other characters.

Fun little movie, maybe not the best movie ever. But at least I know the sequel will be fun. My niece loved it, and with Nickelodeon's name attached, it seems like kids and teens are the primary target of the film, so that's why adults are taking this a little too seriously.",1431734400,,1827,4.5212121212121215

If you were a fan of the Turtles, be it comic book, the cartoon, or the older movies, do not and I mean it, do not watch this movie.  Not unless you are doing it to just see how bad it is.  This was a blatant disregard for any of the source material and added in way too much Megan Fox.  Her acting is horrid in this movie, and was on purpose placed in this movie for sex appeal.  Believe me when I say there isn't a scene that goes by that someone doesn't mention some sexual innuendo regarding her.  Don't get me wrong, she is an attractive girl, but you don't need to be reminded every 2 minutes.  You even get a butt shot and comment from a guy in a very tense situation.  I rented this one on Amazon for 99 cents, though I think I got my 99 cents worth out of it, that was about it.  If it costs more then that, don't waste the money.  To give you a little insight, the Turtles are 8-9 feet tall, are completely bulletproof, and can swing railway shipping containers like they are baseball bats.  Later on in the film they seem to be thwarted by 2 inch thick plexiglass that Raf cannot seem to punch through to save his brothers.  Well not unless they are filled with copious amounts of adrenaline.  Which of course makes Mickey even more annoying then he already was.  Like I said, do not watch this unless you really really need to see how bad it is.  However do not buy it, and do not rent it until it is 99 cents.",1431648000,56,1486,4.086505190311419

Seriously rushing the movie to an apocalyptic ending is not fun. Why not tease the audience with shredder, have him fight as a human and introduce the mechanical suit in the sequel? Why not have the movie focus on something simple but still entertaining. Its always the end of the world with Micheal Bay movies, but I could care less about the world he creates. The only reason I cared about the characters is because I saw the original two ninja turtles as a child. I can't begin to say how sick I am of movies that feel rushed and use a one minute scene to establish a character. Try using thirty minutes to establish a character, or an entire movie that requires the audience be emotionally involved. Micheal Bays movies give me a serious headache. 99 cents was a good deal though, and I loved all the actors, just rushed script. S t o p rushing the script, please stop making lame end of the world plots, a simple well executed plot works much better than some lame lines interspersed with an end of the world theme.",1431216000,2,1154,4.4739336492890995

When you have current, strong, engaging source material (or older, original material) why would you hire such hack writers to do an original script? The CG was uninspired, character scripting overdone, and for a Michael Bay film, far too few explosions by half-way through. Which is when I stopped watching it. The first fight scene between Shredder and Splinter was the final straw, but I should have known to turn it off 10 minutes in. Do not fall for the 4 star rating the movie has.

That's like telling an 8 year old child that Santa Claus isn't real. The brotherhood between them and their relationship with Splinter is what counts no matter what the plot and premise is.

The second reason was because I couldn't stand the last film and feared I was going to watch a sequel being lost from the beginning. I discovered my fears were unfounded as this story starts from the beginning with an updated mildly hip-hop version of the series.

Meagan Fox stars as April O'Neill, the froth reporter who has ties to the group. She is aided by her ""nerd"" camera man (Will Arnett) who wants to have ties to her, The Turtles are up against the Shredder, an evil Samurai robot who leads the Foot Clan intent on taking over NYC.

This is a fun predictable action popcorn film. It is not on the Avenger level of films (what is?) but one the kids can enjoy without thinking too much.

Thanks to Turtles fans everywhere (there's a lot of us -- we're worse than Trekkies) complaining, the Worst Director in Hollywood decided against his frog aliens and just ended up producing Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. What can I say? It's stupid, but it's got Ninja Turtles and Megan Fox. Honestly this movie is pretty awful, with most of it being CGI and a plot line that I can't even remember, but hey, it's freakin' Ninja Turtles and Megan Fox! YEAH! The sequel could only be made better if the Turtles fly over to Syria and fight ISIS and then meander over to Russia and put Putin in his place. TURTLE POWER!",1429833600,2,736,4.5

6328148,5,B00J2T18XS,"I loved this movie. I am big on anything originated in the 90s and 80s and I love remakes and this was a great one.
-first, I loved how unique they looked.
-Secondly I loved how different but fun loving their characters and personalities were.
Donatello (purple) is the slightly slimmer nerdy loveable bother Michaelangleo (orange) is the funniest brother in the movie at least to me
Raphael (red) is the biggest one the rebel of the four. Leonardo (blue) is like the Rapheal they are always bumping heads lol.

At first when I saw the commercial for the movie I was turned off by how big they looked but once I saw the movie I loved it.
I mean over time everything has to get bigger and better just like Godzilla 2014. I liked the story line. I really liked the history
Of how the turtles grew up and the background about Aprils father. The name the foot clan was kinda cheesey but hey what can ya do lol
The only thing I would have changed is the revenge the turtles get when fighting Shredder. It seems they are never ever a match when fighting
Not even Master Splinter and thats so annoying then to make matters worse they let April give the final kick that sent Shredder flying down to his
Non death as we know he NEVER dies!

All and all I lovedddd the comic relief this movie gives it was much funnier than I ever anticipated as I loved comedys. the action was just right
The history behind Aprils family and the turtles growth in the movie tie together was great, to me.",1429574400,,1478,4.332129963898917

6328151,2,B00J2T18XS,"If you like horrible acting, movies that completely ignore the laws of physics (talking turtles excluded), and plot's that don't make sense, then this movie is for you. Don't get me wrong, i know a movie about ninja trained talking turtles is NOT meant to be believable, but to extent it kind of should be semi-believable, like a ""yea what if these turtles existed"". This movie however, managed to make EVERYTHING not realistic.

Things i hated about this movie:
SPOILER ALERT!!! *Dont read if you don't want the movie to be spoiled*

1) When they are sliding down the snow mountain they look as though they are sliding (along with the trucks that are ""driving"" down the mountain) at least 100 mph. However, this scene is like five minutes long making this the tallest mountain in the world and also in upstate New York.

2) Plot and scenes don't make sense. Ex) there's a flashback scene where April Oneil recalls visiting her father at the lab, her father then finds out that the lab projects are being used for bad things and instead of leaving and coming back later to destroy the lab, he lights it on fire while they're both inside... and then they struggle to get out cause everything is on fire...

3) When April finally gets video footage of the Ninja Turtles, instead of showing that footage to her journalist boss who doesn't believe her, April decides to sound like a crazy woman and describe the situation which her boss never believes. Why wouldn't she just show her the video...

4) There's no history on Shredder, and why does he have an exoskeleton?

5) Megan Fox is possibly the worst actress ever.

6) Foot Soldiers are not classic martial arts foot soldiers but instead people with black masks and automatic rifles.",1429488000,4,1734,4.684210526315789

When it came out that the original plot was to make the Ninja Turtles come from outer space, instead of the ooze, every one was up in arms. (My self included) Why change the formula?  Then it came out that William Fichtner was going to be shredder everyone complained because he doesn't look the part. (Yes, he looks evil and conniving, but he is not The Shredder) But in order to please all the people The shredder that they did add was forced.  You just get that feeling that it was added last minute.  So instead of sticking to the original story that everyone knows and loves, they tried to be clever and ruined a money making and awesome franchise.  I personally blame Michael Bay.

You don't even see a Turtle until about half an hour into the movie. The Turtles are a side plot to the main story of April's life and career.

The figure in this edition isn't bad. There's some neat details. It's machine painted so the paint on it isn't perfect. The figure is better than the action figures released for the movies. The sai also were bent a little. There's nothing special about this edition of the movie. I'm pretty sure it's the same copy released outside the box. The box it comes in is nothing special.

The origin story for splinter is RIDICULOUS, i'm not even sure why they would change it. Let's hope this scrap this iteration ASAP.",1426377600,,299,4.2631578947368425
6328304,3,B00J2T18XS,"It's hard to hate on something so enjoyably stupid. TMNT is the latest version of the origin story of the heroes on a half shell and it pulls out all the iconic bits like the pizza, the hip hop and the catch phrases, if only to frame them ironically for a moment. This is a franchise that deserves to have all its iconic bits out with no irony whatsoever, so it's not a five star picture for that alone. But it's not that bad of a movie. I've seen some stinkers, and this is too watchable to be a true stinker. The story is centered on ambitious reporter April O'Neil (Megan Fox) who wants to get out of reporting puff pieces and start anchoring hard news. Her laconic cameraman Verne (Will Arnett) is content to stay with the puff pieces. One night a tip leads April to the docks, where she witnesses a vigilante putting a forceful stop to a raid by the notorious gang called the Foot Clan. The more she pursues the story, the further she is drawn into a situation that ties into her own past. Cue the turtle power. If you're a fan of the franchise and a completist, it's worth at least one view. If you're not a fan, see the 1990 film first and then decide if you want more cowabunga in your life. There are some rude jokes that will go over the heads of most children, but it still pretty much earns its PG13 rating.",1426291200,,1319,4.217391304347826
6328305,3,B00J2T18XS,"It is not the 1990 version, but one of its own. I know you ""shouldn't"" compare things, but it is hard not too since I grew up with the ninja turtles in the 80's followed by the movies in the 90's. Originally I said that I was not going to watch this since the turtles looked like they were hyped up on Steroids from when I was a kid. They also look more mean and not as personable as before... They do grow on you throughout the movie.

But, I decided to give it a chance and I am ok with the fact that I did. There were a lot of things that they could have done better, but with that being said, they kept the morale of the story and that is that they had to work together as a team to figure out who they were together. This was along the same lines as the original movie!

Your kids will love it! Those of us who are fans from long ago, there are a lot of things to be disappointed in, but there are also things that they did well. The relationship between the turtles and April was right on. The lesson that splinter and the turtles had to learn was tubular.

You can tell that Michael Bay was on this project as well. Shredder was very transformer-esque with the way that he moves and used his weapons, also in the sounds that came through during the fights. So you have that little bit of nostalgia to think back to the transformers series.

Overall it was not as bad as I thought it would be. But like everything that gets redone, will never be like the original turtles we know. Kids who have never seen the original turtles will grow up with these guys like we did, and if there is a time 20 years from now when they try to reboot it again, they will think the same thing we did.",1426291200,2,1688,4.044910179640719

They have crushes; disobey their Dad; & still get to save the world!! All while being teenage turtles and using their individual strengths to work together FINALLY!

6328370,3,B00J2T18XS,"Kids and some fans of the original TV series will enjoy, but a very average movie.

I purchased this movie as a present for another longtime TMNT fan and honestly,based upon all the negative feedback went into the experience expecting to hate it, but was pleasantly surprised. The effects in the latest Michael Bay, big budget, loud over explosive re imagining of a childhood favorite animate series was decent, but by no means stellar. This was clearly a movie aimed at children fans of the latest TMNT series that don't really care about plot or character development with enough references to the original cartoon to make it tolerable for their parents.
 My biggest gripes with this movie were that it felt less like a stand alone movie and more like a sequel and the horrid character development. The story, or as many reviewers have stated lack thereof a story, is very apparent. Warning Spoilers ahead! The story jumps right into an apparent long standing onslaught of the city. However, the culprits behind the onslaught are rather brazen and hardly a mystery or secret unlike in the original movie version. If the movie had used any plot from the original three TMNT movies this concept would have been easier to accept, but for a total plot reboot, its simply poor writing. There is no real motivation for the characters other than Megan Fox's April O'Neil. Concerning, Fox's portrayal and acting, it ranged from either trying too hard, to not seeming to care at all, with a dialogue invoking far too many breathless pants resembling auditions for a hentai anime. The second most developed character is William Fichtner's Eric Sacks. Fichtner's Sacks is the true antagonist of the movie and The Shredder is pretty much an after thought that resembles less The Shredder and more Bay's version of Megatron from the first two Transformers movies. The paper thin plot actually would have been better had Sacks been The Shredder instead of a lackey. Will Arnett's Vern Fenwick and the original cartoon series character share only that they are both Channel 6 cameramen and in name. Fans of the original show watching with their kids will recall the character as the effeminate, whiny male comic relief character whereas Arnett's version is a stereotypical macho wannabe.  Sadly, The Turtles themselves are woefully voice acted lack any depth or motivation other than simply stopping the ""bad guy"". The best voice acting performance comes from Tony Shaloub's Splinter that gets very little screen time.

If you are a parent that has young children that do not care about developed stories and simply crave a live TMNT movie, your children will enjoy and you'll be mildly amused by some of the references to the original series. However, the humor in this movie is juvenile in most places and in other places sophomoric. Others that will enjoy this movie are hardcore longtime TMNT fans and Michael Bay movie fans. Everyone else, I recommend you only rent this movie.",1425513600,2,2969,4.932

I guessed and kinda knew since Michael Bey directed it, it would suck.  Also his floozy girl Megan Fox was in it.  This was basically transformers with turtles in it.

No, it's not Oscar-worthy but it's harmless and a movie that I'd watch again without any complaining. First off, the turtles are done right in this movie. They're fantastic and they interact very well with each other. Michelangelo steals the whole movie. The acting is pretty good for the most part. Megan Fox was actually pretty good as April O'Neill and she didn't bother me at all. William Fichtner was also good. The only person who annoyed me was Will Arnett and I really wouldn't mind if he was cut out of the sequel completely. Splinter and Shredder were both well represented although I would've liked to see a bit more of Shredder. Story-wise, this movie is OK. It's cohesive enough to have fun with and the snow chase sequence is fantastic. The 3D on the Blu-ray is also very good, I recommend it. So overall, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles didn't ruin the Turtles like I feared it would and I'm happy to say that I'm excited for the sequel and I'm excited the turtles are back.",1425168000,,1118,4.432038834951456

I was worried about sexual content as well (no offense, but Megan Fox is in it, she's usually half dressed), but she is fully covered and there isn't any sexual content. (Except at the very end when credits start, the billboard V.S. scene, but not too bad). Overall, our entire family enjoyed the movie.

There's not much to the story or plot twists.  The one good thing i can say about the movie is that the Digital Turtles look great.

Main reason we did not love is we were expecting the TMNTs to be fun, cool, and crazy like they used to be but in this movie, they tried to make them more dark, standoffish, and not that fun to watch at times.  On a side note: not sure how Megan Fox ended up in this movie, but she was completely out of place, out of sorts.

It's the plot, the characters, and the lack of feeling or reason. There is little pathos in the movie. Not enough ""showing"". There is a ""tell"" at the end of the movie that feels cheap.  I know how they want us to feel, but it's not that easy. Frankly, if I did not have any previously knowledge or attachment to characters, I would not care.  There was no real development to the characters.  It was a big so what.",1424649600,,562,4.090909090909091

The story itself has some holes, but its a kids movie, so it's cool. Overall, watch the movie, don't expect much, and you'll enjoy Urself watching it.",1424476800,,458,4.810126582278481

I actually preferred the original and not just for the story (which was also way better) but for the fight/action scenes as well.

But I loved this movie! I went to see it in theaters, mainly because my boyfriend wanted to see it, and I liked it better than he did. I thought it was really funny but with a good amount of action too. I rented it the week it came out to watch it again, and have rented it again since.

There is absolutely no explanation of what the Japanese woman's connection to the Foot Clan is...it feels like there is a whole story left being untold here.  Also, apparently the Turtles stumble into all of the Foot Clan in their lair, the Foot take a few potshots, but then...give up?  They're supposedly all over this chemical plant but they're practically nonexistent in the last 20 minutes.  Heck, there's no security for the chemical plant and Vern and April just walk around all over the place, despite the fact that it's the base for an evil crime lord who wants to poison New York City.

The entire fight with  Shredder appeared very formulaic: turtles get their butt kicked, regroup, start fighting again, start winning, end up throwing their weapons at Shredder, end up beating Shredder.

And I wish they had stuck with the original concept of the Foot Clan more.  Maybe not all in purple outfits, but it seems silly to make them not ninjas when they are called the Foot Clan...or not use the idea of them being robots when one of the villains owns an entire robotic facility.

6328547,3,B00J2T18XS,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has come back again on big screen. The good news is that the big-budget reboot version has a lot of action, with the motion-captured Turtles and other familiar characters Splinter and Shredder. The bad news is, well, the new TMNT movie takes itself a bit too seriously, lacking humor and character development that those four Turtles really need.

This reboot is supposed to be an origin story of the Turtles, but if I recall correctly, Megan Fox as a TV reporter April O'Neil gets the most screen time in the earlier part of the movie. I like Megan Fox, but her character is terribly flat, and her interaction with the cameraman Vern Fenwick (Will Arnett) and her boss Bernadette  not Burne  Thompson (Whoopi Goldberg) is not funny as it should.

Being co-produced by Michael Bay, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has decent special effects, but martial arts action part would have been better with more creative choreography. But what the film needs is I think humor, something this film briefly shows in such scenes as Turtles singing in the elevator.

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is not as bad as critics may lead you to believe, but perhaps needs more humor and Cowabunga, too.",1423958400,,1208,4.844660194174757

It was not a good movie at all!!  Its hard to connect with the characters in storyline...and the entire movie is about April....Lets please go back to the old ninja turtles when April was a side actor...not the MAIN CHARACTER!  This movie should have been about the turtles kickin butt...all they did in this movie was cater to April and run from Gun fights.  When were GUNfighting EVER a part of the old ninja turtles???  too Hollywood for me.  Thankfully I got the dvd cheap on amazon and didn't waste too much of my $.,1423699200,,667,4.32258064516129

While it isn't the comic(s) book (and fanboys haven't forgotten it!), it is a nice reinvention of the fifty year old franchise. No doubt in my mind it won't make those who loved the original comics or the original cartoon series or the later cartoon series or even like the new CGI series forget about those, it isn't a total loss. There are some nice set pieces in here and the characters are spot on. The filmmakers reach back to the beginning and pick and choose their characters and plot points.

Shredder was a bit of ironman crossed with a transformer and an industrial shaver, a lot like the monstrous Silver Samurai from the Wolverine movie a few years back. They dropped the down right child like slant they had in the cartoon days and went for more teen angst this time, again, not bad just not movie of the year material. The acting from the human counter parts were what I've come to expect from all the actors involved and wasn't let down or surprised by any of the deliveries.

The Shredder's big plan is to infect the city with a virus that only he has the cure for, so he will swoop in and save the city from the virus and be the big hero that everyone will trust. The plot hole is that the cure requires the Turtles blood and it is stated at one point that the bad guys think the Turtles died in a fire while they were still little non-mutated turtles.

6328645,3,B00J2T18XS,"Some of the comedy, physical and jokes, and Megan Fox are the bright spots of this movie. The story is mostly about the origins of the Turtles and when they first hit the scene of New York City, first witnessed by April ONeil (Megan Fox). The Turtles know that there will be repercussions if the public finds out about them, but the more that April makes a connection between her and when she is younger, everything changes for everyone.

Personally I feel this new Nickelodeon series is a fabulous edition to the TMNT franchise.  Nick has taken out all the things I didn't like from the previous series and combined all the things I did like into one really cool show.  I wasn't too sure about the animation style at first, but it grows on you rather quickly and now I actually rather like it.  All in all, I highly recommend this series, particularly to fans of the previous series.",1422662400,,600,4.579439252336448

6328659,1,B00J2T18XS,"First, I shall start by saying I am a huge TMNT fan. I watched the cartoon growing up and I adored the 1990 live action movie. Heck, I've seen all of the newer incarnations and thought they were fantastic.  I cannot say the same for this movie.

The first mistake was casting Megan Fox, sorry fan boys.  The entire movie felt like she was trying too hard or not really taking the movie seriously.  She wasn't a strong female lead. She didn't have a mind of her own.  She was just dead, filler space, eye candy.

My biggest problem was not Megan Fox or her terrible acting though.  I felt like the writing was absolutely awful. I wanted to care about the turtles. I really really did... but by the end of the movie, I didn't feel anything for any of them.  There was no brotherly bond... and Splinter... I am not even going to go there.

Truth be told, I went in to this with a very biased opinion based solely on the on trailer I saw. I thought the character design would be what ruined it for me but you know what?  It didn't. I didn't mind the design of the turtles like I thought I would.  What could have been an amazing movie was ruined by poor writing, actors who didn't care and stupid special effects... plus there was no Casey Jones. That is the biggest travesty of all.",1422489600,3,1279,4.243801652892562

All I can say is Megan Fox was a HORRIBLE April O'Neil. She's gorgeous and all but if you're going to make a movie that had an AMAZING franchise already, please don't ruin it because you want to cast someone who has the looks but not the acting skills.

Again, I went into this movie with low expectations so that's why I gave it 3 stars instead of 1 or 2. I think if I would've gotten excited (being the Ninja Turtles fan that I am), I would've definitely given it a lower rating.

Conclusion: It's a nice family movie and it will be enjoyable if you are not a big fan of the original Ninja Turtles series (back in the 1990's).",1422403200,,794,4.183006535947713

6328675,1,B00J2T18XS,"The plot? Terrible AND predictable. But that doesn't matter when you pack a ton of senseless action into this movie which, by the way, makes me miss my childhood. The turtles will give your children nightmares. And if they don't, take comfort in knowing that you've exposed them to so much creepy s*** that you've failed as a parent. I won't get into Megan Fox's crappy acting as April. But in all fairness, she's limited to the one facial expression botox will allow her. Her father was killed, she originally saves the turtles, the man she thought was an ally is actually the bad guy who's in cahoots with Shredder. Their plan? Danger to the city, which only they can prevent with the TMNT's blood. Of course. Then there's just a lot of action. A LOT. You get the gist. Did you know that adrenaline just sits in a machine, waiting for you to press the button? Of course you didn't, because that's entirely too predictable to consider actually happening. You also probably don't know that it has a short duration action, and wouldn't sustain anyone that long. Nor does it sub for lost blood. But, i digress.... My point? Save that remnant of your childhood, keep it close to you at night, and don't waste your time or money. Thank you, Michael Bay.

Get over yourselves all of you trying to compare it with crime & punishment, This is a fun movie, lot's of action, fast paced, a ""cowabunga' & pizza movie.  It now has all of the up-to-date computer graphics that everyone loves in current movies.  It would be nicer if the turtles didn't look so ugly in their faces.  They've given a new interpretation as to the origin of the turtles, how it all came about.
The music often reminded me of several other popular action movies, and Will Arnett was so funny, rather reminiscent of Michael Keaton 30 years ago.  Enjoy.",1422230400,,757,4.481751824817518
6328680,3,B00J2T18XS,"Reading all the reviews that said this movie sucked I went into this with mixed expectations.
Being a lifelong turtles fan I knew I had to watch this.  There are not a ton of good things about this movie, but here they are.
The first two and a half minutes were actually quite good, the animation for those was not that bad really.
There is a cool concept that the turtles were April's pets before they were mutated, giving them a deeper connection, if only the execution was better.
Tony Shalloub wasn't as bad as he could have been as the voice of Splinter, not sure is that's one of the good things or bad things.
The turtles weapons looked sort of cool in CGI.  We hear Mikey refer to Vern as ""That old guy.""  Seeing the TMNT wired on adrenalin.  The Whoopi Goldberg moments are kinda fun.
The only real action sequence is the alpine downhill truck fight, that was the coolest part, but I have to say it, why is there a tiny hook on the side of the semi trailer for Mikey to hang on to when he falls off?  The Shredder's suit looks awesome, and I'm sorry but, the Shredder would so win in a prolonged fight with the turtles who apparently learned how to fight from a book.  One bowl of turtle soup please.
And the best thing was  Will Arnett as Vern Fenwick.  I swear he's the only thing that makes this movie watchable.  He's got that sort of deadpan funny thing going on, and he gets to nail the bad guy in the head with a microscope, except he gets shot in the process.  But he really is the best thing in the movie.

And now the bad things:
So, so much wrong with this.
April has been turned into a slightly incompetent average woman who doesn't have a brain in her head.  They removed all of the things that made an interesting and unique character, there is little to no trace left of who she used to be in other aspects of the franchise.  And then there was Megan Fox's performance, nothing special here, but this may be her third best film behind the first two transformers movies, but then again that's not saying much.
Then there's the foot clan, they turned a clan of the best ninjas in media into a group of bland useless bunch of uninteresting gun-toting mercenaries.  That's right folks the foot clan has been reduced to a bunch of generic thugs carrying guns pretending they know what they're doing.  They have become the very definition of clichd action movie henchmen who all look the same.
Karai, who was one of my favorite characters in the franchise was rewritten to be a witless, bland, cowardly, honorless, pathetic excuse for a character.  She apparently received the same treatment as April but to a higher degree.
The dialog is very dumb and it treats the viewers like they're stupid.  It might have been better if they made it a silent movie.
The animation and design for the turtles and splinter weren't very good, and what was with Splinter's tail?  The turtles were also dumbed down personality wise, and the idea that some of them wear sneakers and that they learned ninjitsu from a book is completely stupid.
The plot does have gaping holes if you think about it too much, it does indeed rip off some of the details of Amazing Spiderman and the script problems show.
The elevator scene is completely pointless, coinsidences abound which indicates writers convenience. And this is frankly, a terrible attempt at a beloved franchise by people who didn't care a whole lot about it.

If you can make it through the first half of it without having your childhood nuked to smithereens, the second half is just a smidge better than the first but not by much.
Kids may enjoy it, but I pity them.  Real fans may want to skip the experience, it may cause them deep emotional pain.  Save yourself and watch the one from 2007, or maybe Batman and Robin instead.",1422230400,,3784,4.455072463768116

6328689,5,B00J2T18XS,"I am so excited that I found this! I am always telling everyone about my obsession with TMNT from a child, and talked about the music they made. I played my cassette, then later burned on a CD, the album they recorded to my son. I knew every song by heart, word for word, and one of the songs I sang in my head all the time. I dreamed of the Turtle while hearing the music. It was the best thing ever!  And then the boy I used to babysit, his mom got us tickets to the show. I was ecstatic! That was one of my earlier first concerts I have been too. It was so much fun, and had a blast. Trying to explain the show and the music to those that don't know of it was hard. But I found this and I was able to relive something I loved whenever I want. My son, even as a teen now, enjoys watching this, and hearing the songs, even though he think I am over obsessive.

It is hard to find action movies out there that are not completely animated that make kids fee like they are watching something a bit more adult and this one fits the bill.  A lot of action and lots of comedy without too much language to watch out for or too much goriness, plus mom and dad found it really funny (have a glass of wine or two). A plain fun Friday night flick.  If you are a comic book purist or a Ninja Turtle purist you will probably hate it, if you just want to be entertained you (like my family ) will probably love it.

6328699,4,B00J2T18XS,"There are a lot of movie review sites out there as well as customer reviews here reviewing the movie so I'm going to focus more on the Raphael statue that comes with it as well as the features of this particular Blu-Ray release.

All in all a fantastic sculpt with poor paint job in some areas. It has that feel of cheap-ness in terms of material and paint which is a shame considering how good the sculpt is. The weapons are flimsy and in all likelihood would bend near the points due to the softness of the material right out of the box. Haven't tried using the warm water technique to straighten them but I suspect it wouldn't do much good. Material is pretty much the same as most exclusive statues apart from the Lord of The Rings Extended DVDs which are the best in my opinion. It is sturdy enough and won't break easily but for the price paid I think it's a bit much. Unless you are a hardcore fan, I wouldn't recommend picking it up.

As a side note, the 3D quality of the movie is really poor in most areas. The only saving grace of this release is the special features highlighting the making of the movie which focuses more on the motion capture technology which at this point can be considered old since James Cameron's Avatar and The Adentures of Tintin have already used the technology extensively. It's a shame that they don't even bother to include anything about the franchise itself which has tons of history behind it, I mean they do mention it but not in depth which to me is pretty dissapointing.",1421971200,,1517,4.414285714285715

6328762,4,B00J2T18XS,"I grew up in the 1980s, and was a big fan of the Ninja Turtles, who saw their popularity climax during the late 80s and early 90s. As an old school fan, I can say that I appreciate this newest incarnation of the heroes in a half shell. You could sit here and easily criticize all the things that are ""wrong"" with it all day, but I think the movie team did a great job of embracing the cheesiness and B-level qualities that made the original movies/cartoons/comics so endearing to fans from my generation. I actually love the new look that was given to the turtles, which further enhances their personality differences, as well as the new take on Shredder, who comes off as being truly worthy of the role of ""Saturday morning cartoon super villain"". It also helps that the human cast does a great job, with Will Arnett stealing the show with his hilarious lines and facial expressions. This movie also has what could very well be the greatest chase sequence (the mountain top descent) I have EVER seen!",1421452800,2,1001,4.535911602209945

6328776,3,B00J2T18XS,"I didn't know the TMNT cartoon at all, so I watched this film (on a flight) with a fairly open mind.

This was a fairly predictable action film, but it was fun.  The dialogue was humorous and light-hearted enough which balanced the good enough action scenes.  The story made sense, except for the part, of course, where are these big turtles running around with swords.  If there were, I think just capturing one and showing him on tv would have made the bad guy rich and famous enough.

All of the characters were rather cliche.  Whether the damsel (Megan Foxx), the Master (Splinter), or the bad guy (William Fitchner), or of course the four turtles; they all played the fairly one-dimensional role that they had.  In contrast are, usually, the Spider Man films where the bad guys always are a bit sympathetic, and Spidey himself usually faces some sort of moral dilemma.

I'm glad I didn't spend 20 dollars to see this film, but it was fine for a flight or a slow night.",1421280000,2,973,4.551724137931035

6328787,3,B00J2T18XS,"People like to give Michael Bay a lot of flak for making over-produced, juvenile films that pander to the lowest common denominator, but for what it's worth people go and see them. Even though he only produced this remake, his fingerprints are clearly visible on the finished product (which is what this is: a product). When I was a kid, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles was one of my favorite cartoons to watch on Saturday morning and I even watched one of the original live-action movies, too. However, as an adult now, the concept seems pretty silly, to be honest. Giant, mutated turtles that know karate and fight crime? It's pretty far out there, but it's something that kids can enjoy and this movie works on that level. Still, the violence might be a little intense for the target demographic and a lot of the humor will probably fly right over their heads. But for me? TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES was a slickly produced but generic action movie with little to recommend outside of the turtles. The plot was really basic and involves April O'Neil and Raphael going to save the other three turtles and stop Shredder from unleashing a toxin from one of the tallest towers in the city. If that sounds similar to THE AMAZING SPIDER-MAN, that's because it is. What worked for me was the humor and banter between the four turtles, who managed to have distinct personalities, as opposed to the Transformers. The animation on them was also pretty good. Shredder, on the other hand, was too over-the-top for me. He was definitely reminiscent of what Bay did with the Transformers, and looked like a mecha ninja suit with gigantic Swiss army knives on both arms. The human characters, sadly, were not well-done either. Megan Fox is laughable as April O'Neil and receives top billing, but she wasn't as bad as she was in Transformers. Will Arnett as Vern Fenwick was...why was he in this movie other than make passes at April O'Neil? Even William Fichtner wasn't given much to do as Eric Sacks, a scientist/businessman who worked with April O'Neil's father. However, one useful story innovation was creating a personal connection between April and the turtles (and Splinter). Overall, TMNT makes for a decent time-passer but is in no way a great film. It should satisfy the younger crowd it's aimed at, but I can't say whether or not fans of previous incarnations will enjoy it the same way. I pity the person who paid full price to see this in theaters, but it's not too bad for a rental.",1421280000,3,2482,4.721198156682028

6328823,4,B00J2T18XS,"You could've smote me with a feather when it turned out - despite its gaping flaws - that I came out of this movie not hating it. Fact is, I liked it in a guilty pleasure kind of way. It's partly because I'm a fan of the awesome current CG-animated Nickelodeon series, and this live-action movie adaptation, while it does take its liberties, does keep faith in terms of tone and and its lively characterization of the four squabbling sibling turtles. Don't twist it, though, the Nick show is loads better and is more coherent. Plot-wise, the movie is as if it's a fish market that's been swept up by a drive-by tornado. Really messy and scattered and kind of smelly. But I liked it enough.

Clearer heads prevailed and so we don't get any of that alien origin crap. And, it turns out, that white dude in the trailer isn't Shredder after all. And Megan Fox as April O'Neil could've been worse. I was okay with what she brought. I was okay with her spending tons of time cowering behind furniture as sh-- went down. I was even okay that it took nineteen minutes before the turtles manifested in full because I appreciated the build-up and the tease. And while I'm still not sure how I feel about the plot twist of - and a ***SPOILER alert*** now for the rest of this paragraph -------- April's being the daughter of the scientist who experimented on the four turtles That Turned Out To Be Her Childhood Pets, I wasn't that outraged about it. It's not as if previous incarnations hadn't played fast and loose with TMNT canon before. For example, depending on the source material or the ensuing reboots and formats, April O'Neil is either a lab assistant, a television reporter, or a teenager.

No, son, there were other oopsies in this film that were more egregious and that really nagged at me, such as Splinter's suddenly reedy voice lacking that required gravitas or the unfathomably lame fashion in which Splinter and his turtles learned ninjutsu or Will Arnett's kiss-of-death presence as a smitten cameraman who's simply there to waste space and be unfunny. Arnett is so awful that, by association, I'm now judging Amy Poehler.

And maybe I do mind Megan Fox a bit, or, rather, that she's so much onscreen. She ends up bogarting precious camera time away from the turtles. Because when the turtles are onscreen, they are fantastic! I'm totally over my freak-out over their having noses and looming at six feet tall. See Michelangelo styling those puka shells and dispensing corny pick-up lines, and the shy, nerdy egghead Donatello sporting those taped-up glasses, and Leonardo and Raphael still at loggerheads yet ultimately fiercely loyal to each other and their siblings and their sensei. The quintessential TMNT moment isn't any of those scenes in which they're wiping the floor with the Foot Clan or when they're chowing down on pizza, and it's not when Mikey lets out that one catchphrase he'd been holding back on for years. No, it's when they're in that elevator en route to a rooftop showdown with Shredder. You'll know it when you see it. Anyway, 3.5 out of 5 stars for this one. While the scatterbrained script and the acting and those loud signature Michael Bay-isms won't bowl anyone over, I'm gratified that the film did give us moments that captured the innate goofy fun of the TMNT brand. The martial arts mayhem is awesome. I easily bought into the motion-capture CGI, which, to me, is just this side of impeccable (okay, I had a problem with Splinter's design). You don't at all doubt that the turtles are present and solidly there, seamlessly integrated into the real world and convincing as real-life, in-place bringers of many asskickings and silly one-liners. So I'm down for a sequel, and I'm crossing my fingers that, next time, there'd be more heroes on a half-shell onscreen and less of cowering television reporters and none at all of that buzzkill Will Arnett guy. And I'd like some Casey Jones, please.",1420934400,,3934,4.748538011695906
6328824,5,B00J2T18XS,"After seeing this movie in the theater, my 5 year old daughter absolutely HAD to have it when it came out on DVD.  So it was a no-brainer when Christmas rolled around as to what I needed to give her!  The movie is VERY funny, it absolutely surprised me when I saw it, because I'm not a big TMNT fan, didn't even really want my daughter to be, but I am so glad I went to see it.  It kept me laughing, and the graphics were amazing.  The action in the movie was perfect and kept my kids entertained the entire movie through.  There were not any parts that I would have rather not been in there -- it was violent only because they were fighting -- but anyone who knows anything about the ninja turtles know that they fight, and it is not going to surprise you to see that in the movie.  I think in terms of bad language, there was only one or two times that we heard a word that I wouldn't want my kids repeating, but they went in understanding that, and it wasn't done in bad taste either, so it wasn't too bad.  There wasn't anything bad about this movie, and we have watched it a million times since opening it on Christmas morning.  Definitely a family favorite!!",1420934400,2,1164,4.165178571428571

I was a bit surprised as it had quite a few dirty jokes but they where not obvious to a young child. Any kid over 13 tho is going to understand the references.. So if you don't mind a bit of  dirty innuendos then you'll be fine. As for the TMNT Fan boys, if you expect this movie to follow the cartoons you're going to hate it.

6328850,3,B00J2T18XS,"There's obviously plenty of room for improvement with this insane concept but I actually liked the movie! Mostly. There were really only 2 major problems I had with the flick.

1. Near the end it got a little too corny with a bad setup of one of the bad guys trying to load-up his ""evil chemical"" when the good guys (2 humans) bust in and try to stop him. Very awkward staging to say the least. That entire series of sequences should have been cut and redone because the ending is critical for redeeming a lower caliber movie like this.

2. Megan Fox. Need I say more? Don't get me wrong she is serious eye candy but she barely registers on the emotional scale. It's like she decided against Botox injections and then took a swan-dive in a pool of Botox! She just doesn't emote. She should consider working behind the camera and be replaced as April O'Neil.

But I will say this. This is one of the best ""B"" movies I've see in a while! I still think ""Battle: Los Angels"" is the best ""B"" movie made but TMNT(3D) wasn't to far behind. I did enjoy myself in the end...",1420761600,2,1065,4.288557213930348

Sadly, this movie was mediocre.

To make a long story short, my biggest complaint with the movie is that for a movie called Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, we don't really get a good chance to appreciate the turtles and their brotherly relationship. The four brothers have always had a great dynamic with each other and this movie seemed more interested in Megan Fox scenes and Optimus Shredder than the namesake of the movie.",1420761600,2,570,4.578431372549019

I usually try to find something good to say about ever movie I watch, as I know nobody sets out to make a bad movie; however, the best thing I can say about this movie is that it ended and that I did not pay to see it in the theater.",1420588800,2,800,4.188311688311688
6328916,3,B00J2T18XS,"It wasn't like it was the greatest thing ever but coming in with low expectations, it was much better than I anticipated.  I didn't mind the turtles being super steroid turtles. I thought they were likeable too.  I thought shredder was a little too transformer (Director Michael Bay made it obvious he was the transformer movie director too)  but Shredder was the super villain he needed to be.

The movie as a whole is just ok. It's a forgettable movie in that just like transformers, the plot and characters take a backseat to action and special effects.  The action and special effects are indeed good, but they still don't make up for the other portions of film making that the movie lacks.

As far as cast.  I love Will Arnett and he was hilarious in the movie. I thought Megan Fox did a good job as April O Neal. Johnny Knoxville didn't do too bad as the voice of Leonardo either.",1420588800,2,886,4.46583850931677

6328919,3,B00J2T18XS,"I am not a movie critic, but I am going to put a lot of harsh criticism's on this movie. THE BAD: This reboot was nothing like the 90's version I grew up with , the plot was entirely different. Casey Jones wasn't in it , I was really disappointed,  which is almost like not having Venom exist as a villain in Spiderman. April had no connection with Splinter or the Turtles or at least the original didn't. They did not have bebok or rock steady. Thought the turtles accents were kind of corny, they didn't have that hardcore surf dude voices like they did in the 80's cartoon. They didn't have the brain dude in the movie. THE GOOD: I did love that they made them do real martial arts and not cheesy Hollywood fighting. I love how they made all the characters more cultural, conforming more to Japanese culture, that's what I liked the most. The computer generation was great, but that's a no brainer for 2010's. I don't know what the people responsible for this whole movie were thinking, they missed a lot of things, that's why I hate reboots.",1420502400,,1045,4.414507772020725

6328922,3,B00J2T18XS,"So TMNT traditionalist will probably be irritated by the inaccuracies in this version.  First, In this remake April O'Neil's father and some evil guy ""create"" the turtles and she is the one who saves them....so not accurate!  Then Master Splinter teaches himself the art of the ninja from a book and has no master/owner (which gives him no real reason to despise the Shredder). The movies focuses way too much on April O'Neil's life and feelings...who cares!  It's suppose to be about the turtles, not her.  The cinematography is great and the fight scene effects are really good but the accuracy is compromised so all the kids born after 1998 will love it but everyone before that time will know they cut corners. And IDK  why everyone keeps calling Mikey a pervert in this movie. He obviously has a crush and no filter so they make him the comedic relief. He's not gross or too much like the other reviews were saying. They just make him look like a funny, over confident, oblivious teenage guy with a crush.",1420502400,4,1010,4.651685393258427

6328958,3,B00J2T18XS,"The movie was okay.  I don't think it was as bad as a lot of people make it which probably is due in large part to nostalgia.  At the same time, it is a pretty forgettable movie.  Here is a quick run down of what I thought was good and bad:

Pros:
Redesigned turtles - I loved the originals but the new designs really gives them a different look for each one that suits their personalities and allows you to distinguish them aside from just colors.  Ralph is big and broad, Leo has a bit more of a normal build, Mike is short and Donny is a little gangly.  They also all have their own little things like Donny has a bunch of tech hanging off of him, Ralph has a bandana like eyeband etc.  Good designs.
Action - The action scenes in this were really entertaining and I also enjoyed how the turtles had much more strength than the originals.  It made them more superhero like with some of the feats they were able to pull off.

Cons:
Forgettable story - The whole point of this is to watch the turtles kickbutt.  The story is just there to make that happen.
So-so acting - Nothing really stuck out as great acting.  I really hated how they made Mikey, he was the super chill guy before and now he is just a pervert and always hitting on O'neal...gets really really annoying, cringey, and makes him less likable.
Foot Clan - No more cool hand to hand Foot Clan combat, it is mainly gunplay...which I wouldn't have minded, but they really needed to not do as much gunplay and more kung fu.  Also the shredder redesign is god awful, imagine a walking Iron Throne from Game of Thrones (the swords chair)...and that is pretty much his design...really dumb.
April O'neal - She is not a con due to Megan Fox (I think she did alright for the role), there is simply too much focus on her and not enough on the turtles.  It should have been titled ""April O'neal and the Turtles"".

Overall, worth a rent for some mindless action, but don't think you'll remember the storyline anymore than how you can remember the last die hard's story line...all you remember is the fighting and the explosions.  A fun, mindless romp that was made for the younger demographic...just like the old one when it was released.",1420329600,2,2194,4.382716049382716
6328959,3,B00J2T18XS,Its not a bad movie. Story line is messed up and they changed the foot clan from ninjas to a modern military group. Yet it was still fun to watch,1420329600,2,145,3.8666666666666667

6328962,2,B00J2T18XS,"Even blatantly fictional movies as this one should have the ability to draw you in to the plot & characters.

****WARNING MAJOR SPOILERS*****

Reasons why this movie sucked donkey butt

1- They completely changed the lore. They made Megan Fox the original owner of the  the turtles and Splinter. Whaaaat? She is the one that ""saved them from the fire in the lab"" and released them in to the sewer when she was a little girl ,while her father died in the lab. So she did not help her father. The turtles were ""being tested on ""genetically altered  by the lab  unlike the original lore.

2-The dialogue is super hokey and generic and I do not think the screen writers even ever watched the original TMNT before because aside from 2 ""Cowabungas"" and a couple of  ""Brahs"" uttered, the turtles were some how generic, one dimensional copies of their former selves. The bad guy who is already filthy rich (see #7) wants to become ""even richer"" he says.

3-Splinter looks creepy. His eyes are all black and they make him younger and sound younger yet when  he fights the Shredder  he gets beat almost to death right in the beginning !!!!

4-Shredder is somehow a ""sensei /master"" from Japan that adopted the  other bad guy in the film when he was a child and raised him. The problem is the bad guy looks to be the same age as Shredder if not older. Oh and Shredder has scars on his face but hmm I wonder where they are from since in the original lore it was SPLINTER who gave him those scars!

5-They  borrowed some Transformers armor for the Shredder  that made him like 8 feet tall and made him invincible. He is super strong and super fast and has these knives that he fly out of his armor .....then come back to him! ( More than meets the eye!)

6-They totally took out Casey Jones  from the movie and instead make  April's camera guy the sort of love interest ( well  just one of the guys in the movie that tells April that she is a"" hot chick"" five million times in the movie)

7-The  actual plot is good if you are a 5 year old. Basically the rich bad guy who owns a major Robotics company, a pharma company and another company I already forgot , wants to unleash this poison in New York, then sell the cure back to New York while his Sensei Shredder rules New York! ( Insert generic  evil laugh here. )

8-They changed one of the turtles in to a  eye glasses wearing computer  hacker.

9-The military presence in the movie is unneeded and unwanted  or no wait they are Shredders special Military Ninjas Black Ops Call of Doody Ninjas because that is what the kids like today!

10-The very looooong and quite boring scene where the turtles are falling down the side of the mountain on the tractor trailer and defying physics at every turn, having long conversations while falling to their deaths that are not even funny. The camera  guy staring at Aprils butt while she hangs out of the window taking pictures while she is falling down the side of said mountain . Yeah , unneeded and unwanted but worst of all ...unfunny.

11- April is the one who kills the Shredder, she is hanging by one arm about 80 stories up and she tells the turtle holding her "" swing me over to him"" She then kicks shredder and he falls to his death.  So she was not even scared to be that high or to be swung like that but I guess someone had to get rid of the Shredder because right before this, ALL the turtles get their shells handed to them by the Shredder and he  beats them all . Oh and Splinter is still recuperating back in the old sewer but he doesn't die .

Lame movie, the screen writers should be ashamed of themselves for not even trying to give  the old fans any  nostalgia. Guardians of the Galaxy was waaaaaaay better . ""Finger across the throat ....means death!!!""",1420243200,3,3885,4.31767955801105

6329022,1,B00J2T18XS,"Have to agree with several others, this movie isn't that great, even for kids/family - there are far better uses of time, and I'm kind of ashamed I wasted mine on this.  The CG was OK in most spots - in particular the detail on the turtles was well done, but there were also spots that it was really obviously CG and just looked bad.  Definitely a case of over-use, simpler would have been better.  The shredder literally looked like a little toy robot, didn't feel real.  The story was patchy at best - no explanation of the back-story for the shredder (though to be fair, I'm not sure that I recall there ever was one).  Numerous holes - particularly in time/space - for example an access tunnel not far from a new york mountain castle into the heart of the city was just too much too believe - esp. since they can slide down it the entire way - no running, no cars required, and they get there as fast or faster than a helicopter with a direct flight line. And the ending sequence (last 5-ish mins maybe) was just total crap, I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough.  The comedy aspects were way over-done and felt forced.  Megan Fox  seemed to play her part well, at least in terms of what I would have expected for an action flick and given the role she had (I don't generally judge acting ability too much, so others may disagree).

Overall, this just isn't worth the time or money, even though I thought my expectations were low enough, this was was a step below them.  It's good aspects just aren't enough to even get 2 stars.",1420156800,,1533,4.366197183098592
6329023,1,B00J2T18XS,This movie was literally horrible. I can't believe I wasted $3.99 watching it. The storyline seems as though it was developed by a four-year-old. Every line was absolutely painful to listen to. The one saving grace could have been Will Arnett's character (awkward/funny) but Megan Fox's horrible acting and the complete lack of a meaningful storyline far overshadowed anything funny that Will Arnett did during the movie.

6329057,3,B00J2T18XS,"Your age and/or movie-viewing history will likely affect how forgiving you are of this film's major flaws.

Like the ""Transformers"" franchise, this film also spends too much time with its stale human leads instead of the eponymous heroes. Megan Fox possibly doesn't move her eyebrows once throughout the entire film, yet the viewer is asked to care and root for her as the tale's true protagonist. She is especially insufferable in the early beginnings while waiting for the mysterious heroes to finally appear and command their own narrative. The plot is contrived, cliched and absurd, with numerous holes and inconsistencies.

BUT... the turtles are cool. Their fun personalities are properly intact, and class clown Michelangelo is still a blast. The villains are solid, human comic relief Will Arnett delivers, and the action sequences / special effects are all quite good, especially one madcap scene with everyone furiously fighting and tumbling down a snowy mountainside.

So if your inner film critic wants to gripe about the wooden acting and dumb story, then your inner preteen boy will miss out on an otherwise enjoyable romp.",1420156800,4,1137,5.202185792349726

When I heard about the new ninja turtles movie being made by computers, I
was kind of skeptical at first until I bought the movie and watched it. It was much better than what I thought it turned out to be and now
think this is the best turtle movie they have ever made. I would recommend any turtle fans to buy this movie asap. believe me it is worth it",1420070400,2,672,3.9411764705882355

The turtles and Splinter look great and The Shredder is an awesome villain. Megan Fox and Will Arnett also have a really good chemistry with each other and with the turtles. Definitely more family-friendly than a lot of other recent superhero films and probably a lot more action-packed and fun in general.

6329116,4,B00J2T18XS,"I have no idea why the critics panned this movie. I grant you that this was not my generational thing, I came before the Turtles. However, as a watcher of a movie...I liked it a lot. Lots of action and at times pretty funny. I particularly liked the turtle with the orange mask, he was pretty hysterical with the one liners. From what I could see each of the voicers had a firm grasp on the turtle they portrayed. You may want to know why this wasn't 5 stars.....simple...who in the name of God really thinks that Megan Fox can act!!!!!! The absolute worst! She is so unconvincing that she brings the movie down with every scene she is in. The camera man is great though.",1419984000,,671,4.333333333333333

I thought it was just some dust and it did not happen again through the movie. Then we watched it again yesterday and it skipped at the same spot and then nothing for the rest of the movie. So, I took the movie out and cleaned it and put back in and fast forwarded it to that part and it skipped AGAIN!!! Not pleased with the movie quality due to the flaw. Is it just my copy of the movie or has anyone else had issues?",1419897600,,572,3.8974358974358974

6329160,2,B00J2T18XS,Cool remake but the original is better.  Martial arts with comic relief for teenagers.  The quality of the download was great although I do not own a 3D television it appeared as if it was in 3D.  I would have given a higher rating but I feel 2 cast members were not necessary in the story.,1419811200,,290,4.142857142857143

6329171,4,B00J2T18XS,"Better than I expected. It upset a decent amount of people who wanted it to be more like the originals, but I figure if they followed the blueprint from the originals people would just have something different to complain about.

They ran out of the room at the first suspenseful part.  The fault is mine since the movie is PG-13, but I thought that there would be nothing wrong with Ninja Turtles that youngsters couldn't see.",1419811200,,346,4.212121212121212

However, the writing and plot are almost inexcusable and absolutely terrible. Releasing poison gas in the city of New York was the best they could come up with. Just go watch the 1990 masterpiece",1419811200,,368,4.676923076923077

6329182,4,B00J2T18XS,"This movie has all the structures of a good story, character development, plot, scenes, dialogue, and so on. The only thing that I found disappointing was April and Michael Bay's weird idea about innuendo. April is the main character of the plot, not the TMNT which so many others have grown irritated about.  She is an idiot, underachieving little brat. The comics and cartoons and even the original movie, she was smart, cunning, sweet, and devoted. This new April is only devoted, but even if she got what she needed to show her producer, she came as a nut job and told them everything.
The overall movie is great, now when someone rewrites a classic, the first thing people should do is forget the old. If the viewer expects everything to be like the original classic, then of course they're going to hate iy",1419811200,,812,4.638888888888889

So pretty much just like everyone else says, if your a long time ninja turtle fan this movie is horrible but if u never really care and just want something to watch with your kids i guess it would be entertaining.

6329231,3,B00J2T18XS,"I have been a fan of TMNT since watching the cartoon every day when I was younger and watching the original live action movie every day I was home sick from school. Throughout the storyline changes and knowing that Michael Bay was involved in the making of the movie and Megan Fox was in it, I tried to remain as level headed as possible when sitting down to watch this movie. Overall, it is a fun movie to watch with great special effects and carrying some of the classic turtle traits and storyline elements, but there were definitely some plot holes and dialogue that made me go ""huh?"". The quote ""We will drain every last ounce of their blood to get it, even if it kills them!"" is crazy and I laughed more than I should have when I heard it. Megan Fox's acting was better than in the transformers movies but still terrible. The neverending scene going down the snowy mountain was crazy...I mean if the mountain was that tall and they were going straight down and it took them that long to get to the bottom, it should have taken days to drive to the top. This movie is not as bad as I thought it was going to be, but it could have been a lot better. In the end, a large movie budget and bad storyline can't save the beloved turtles. I would recommend watching it once just to see it, but I would not buy it myself (luckily, it was given as a Christmas present along with a retro TMNT t-shirt).",1419724800,2,1397,4.2556390977443606

It is an interesting take on it all.  I thought it was an overall well put together movie.  Fight scenes were really cool and I did like the updated Shredder.  How majority of the movie well in my point of few was not so much about the Turtles but of April and her family.

  Again, it is hard to really like the movie because of how the Turtles looked to me.  I prefer the 90's Ninja Turtles because didn't look like they were steroids.  It was worth the rent on Amazon but to buy the movie no.",1419638400,2,671,4.0458015267175576

It took me just a few minutes to get over that dread and enjoy the newest reboot of TMNT. It was fun despite the crazy explosions and the strange situations that they found themselves in. I was disappointed about the change in their origin story, but I enjoyed the rest of the story line.

6329285,2,B00J2T18XS,"Yikes... though I will admit I watched this movie with an already familiar background of TMNT lore, but I kept on open mind. Megan Fox instead of playing a sharp strong April O'Neil that is what every TMNT show has, she played more of a dumb ditzy teenage Lois Lane. This ruins the whole character reputation for April. The only real reason to watch this movie is because of Mikey. If they didn't have Mikey, this movie would have flopped so hard it would have been earth shattering, people would have died... the world would crumble... babies would cry... no one would ever forget the black stain that Michael Bay could never wash away. Oh wait... Transformers.
Anyways, if you go in watching this ridiculous pathetic excuse for a movie without knowing any background info, you'd think it is utter crap with the lamest quotes imaginable,(Ex) Donny: ""They have tranq darts!"" Leo: ""Well don't let them touch your skin!""  The stupid action scenes that look forced and not at all properly plotted out. (Any fight scene with Shredder) And the random close up scenes when all you see is Megan Fox screaming out into the camera to try to give feeling for the scene. And let me not forget to mention a ripoff of the villian wanting to poison New York City by shooting some green stuff into the air from one of the highest towers and let the population take it in.

I don't normally give movies so low a rating but this was really really disappointing. I felt like they forced Raph to be angry it didn't come natural in the script at all at least in my opinion. Splinter was there worldy sensei and yes father figure but not what I felt mean and abusyve like in this movie. There was no real emotion.

The turtles and splinter were April's pets. Why was the Shredder even in NY? And Splinter just learned ninjutsu from a book. No, that's stupid. The story is the Shredder and Splinter's master Yoshi were in love with the same woman. Yoshi and the girl came to America and the Shredder followed. The Shredder killed the girl and Yoshi and Splinter attacked the Shredder. And he learned ninjutsu from watching Yoshi from his cage. On the streets of Ny Splinter became a sewer rat to survive. He found the turtles crawling in the ooze and rescued them. And that's how the begging story works. Other than that some comedy was good.

6329305,4,B00J2T18XS,"I've been a fan of the Ninja Turtles ever since the 1987 Ninja Turtles cartoon came out. Then I saw the live action version of the movie in 1990 and I was disappointed that it didn't feature the turtle van, Krang, Bebop and Rocksteady, however I liked the movie which still holds up to this day. Fast forward to 2014 and you get a Ninja Turtles movie that's a lot closer to the 1987 cartoon, however the only thing missing from this movie is Bebop, Rocksteady and Krang. The turtle van made an appearance towards the very end of the film, which is awesome. They also had Vern from the 1987 cartoon played by Will Arnett, which is awesome because I liked him in Arrested Development. They also casted the hottest April O'Neil ever...Megan Fox.

Now what are my gripes about this movie? They made Shredder look like the Silver Samurai and Iron Man combined. There is no mention of Hamato Yoshi. The Turtles look like they're on steroids. The turtles also look a little too weird. They should have stayed with the original design, but just change things a little with their attire. Also CGI doesn't look as good as animatronics/rubber suits, which is what was so appealing about the original Ninja Turtles. Also Donatello does not need to wear stereotypical glasses.

So I give this film a 4 out of 5, it could have been better if they fixed certain problems here and there. But it's at least better than Transformers.",1419552000,34,1415,4.58893280632411

I felt that they were animated to look repulsive, including Splinter, who was disgusting, Megan Fox was ridiculous as April, the story was stupid regardless of if it was consistent with the comics or not, the movie was slow and too dark, why would the turtles be sexually attracted to basically their own mom, and the dialogue was uninteresting and poor.

6329334,4,B00J2T18XS,"Overall, this was a pretty good action movie that is suitable for all audiences.  It is filled with action, keeps you on the edge of your seat and is hopefully the first in a line of movies that gives TMNT sufficient life and expression.

I got a good laugh out of some of the critique from other viewers, especially with regards to the plot and overall substance.  Um, it's a movie about genetically mutated turtles that talk and are adept at karate!  The plot is pretty good for what it is.  I felt it covered most of the bases -- I have the original comics -- I expect the story will become more complex as sequels are introduced.  No movie adaptation is going to be that complete.  The movie has a general sense of a introduction (or reboot) of TMNT.  Frankly, I am looking forward to more.

I highly recommend it for a good afternoon flick with (or without) the kids.",1419465600,,872,4.366459627329193

6329353,5,B00J2T18XS,"""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" is pretty good. This is how the story goes: Darkness has settled over New York City as Shredder and his evil Foot Clan have an iron grip on everything from the police to the politicians. The future is grim until four unlikely outcast brothers rise from the sewers and discover their destiny as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. The Turtles must work with fearless reporter April O'Neil and her cameraman Vern Fenwick to save the city and unravel Shredder's diabolical plan.

The cast led by Megan Fox (as April O'Neil) & Will Arnett (as Vern Fenwick) is pretty good. The directing by Jonathan Liebesman is pretty good. The story & screenplay (based on characters by Peter Laird & Kevin Eastman) by Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec & Evan Daugherty is pretty good.

The music by Brian Tyler is pretty good. The cinematography by Lula Carvalho is pretty good. The film editing by Joel Negron & Glen Scantlebury is pretty good. The casting by Debra Zane & Kathleen Chopin is pretty good. The production design by Neil Spisak is pretty good. The art direction by Miguel Lopez-Castillo & Scott P. Murphy is pretty good. The set decoration by Debra Schutt, set dressings by Jory Alvarado, Michael Bruno, Paul Camarro, Jody Del Giorno, Timothy Feimster, Liza Grant, Deneice O'Connor, Sam Rosedietcher, Marisa Umsawasdi, Travis Wright & Tim Zydel is pretty good. The costume design by Sarah Edwards is pretty good. The conceptual designs by Paul Gerrard & Steve Jung, creature designs by Jared Krichevsky & Jerad Marantz & character designs by Aaron Sims is pretty good. The stunts coordinated by Scott Rogers, Garrett Warren & Shane Yan (motion capture) & fights coordinated by Jonathan Eusebio is pretty good. The special effects supervised by Burt Dalton & coordinated by Cole Taylor is pretty good. The visual effects supervised by Pablo Helman, Edson Williams, Thierry Delattre, Joseph Kasparian, Jesper Kjolsrud, Katherine Rodtsbrooks & Philippe Theroux & coordinated by Catherine Belanger-Gagnon, Joanie Croteau, Melissa Gray, Luis Alejandro Guevara, Jenna Kerr, Martine Losier, Karina Mariano, Zuzana Mikus, Shawn Smolensky, Georgina Street & Kraig Tytus are pretty good.

This is a pretty good movie / reboot that is fun and entertaining. This is also a pretty good reboot for the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles franchise that works. Michael Bay, Andrew Form & Bradley Fuller (producers), among others, alongside director Jonathan Liebesman & writers Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec & Evan Daugherty, have done a pretty good job rebooting the franchise up. This is also a pretty good summer movie, as well, too, that helped end last summer, pretty solidly, as well.",1419465600,,2682,5.160919540229885

6329363,1,B00J2T18XS,"Look, I gave the movie a chance and rented it the other night. I can honestly say I am grateful that I did not pay $10 to see this in theaters.

I'm sure kids and early 20 somethings might find this movie fantastic, but I have some major issues with it. The Foot Clan heavily relied on guns, and were kind of pathetic compared to the Foot Clan in the first movie. Second the CGI budget. What happened?! Whoever was in charge of Splinter had a great concept, and somehow they managed to make some of the scenes awful. They just didn't blend them in like they should.

The story was okay, and the only reason I can justify one star. If you liked the movie, GREAT, you revie wit for what you want, but I didn't like it so I'm going to give it 1 star. Hopefully, if they do another one, they'll make a better effort.",1419379200,2,812,4.132911392405063

6329371,5,B00J2T18XS,"This is certainly one of the years most exciting movies, and one of the most entertaining too, I think in terms of bringing these characters to the big screen again after all these years they have done a top notch job, you will always get haters no matter what always trying to spoil the fun so don't listen, im not a massive fan of the franchise and watched this with lower expectations but totally loved it for what it is, you don't need to look at it as just a kids movie anymore, just enjoy it as a stand alone action sci-fi fantasy, this is a darker and more realistic vision of what these characters should be like due more to the fact the effects now make them look so much more like actual mutant turtles and they look badass, the action is great, some a little over the top but that's to be expected, the effects like I said are top notch, each turtle has a great personality and each stand out on their own, even splinter with modern effects was more believable and more fun, shredder of course was done really well and looks a badass in his suit, the rest of the cast was fine too, Megan Fox was a beautiful and perfectly good April character, the story arc works well with a few minor changes from past stories but who cares, I think adults can have fun with this just as much as the kids, its funny and hip and well up to date with its jokes and one-liners, and of course you still get the classic quotes that you expect like cowabunga etc but they just come over less cheesy, the movies soundtrack is good too, cool score by Brian Tyler as usual and the end credit song shell shocked is pretty catchy and is the new turtle power! any fan should be happy this reboot has been done it fits in really well with the current next gen comic book movies etc, cant wait for the sequel, like I said its funny, plenty of action, and highly entertaining and really worth checking out, you might surprise yourself, you know you want to watch it really.

Blu-ray has great picture quality (based on the USA Blu-ray) Comes with DVD version too (Region 1 only)
Blu-ray is region free and plays no problem in UK players too.
Lots of good features that cover the making of and effects etc, shell shocked music video and making of.

6329373,3,B00J2T18XS,"As a long time fan of our favorite reptilian heroes I was a bit skeptical of how this movie would do. I had read many reviews of the film and, overall, I agree with some of the finer points: The turtles do not show up for the first 15 - 20 min. of the film, but once the turtles do you are hooked. And indeed the turtles are the best part of the film, but getting to them is a struggle. The plot of the film is a mess, and the focus on April O'Neal is both unnecessary and the weakest part of the film. However, the spirit of our four green brothers is maintained and preserved. The action is great, and there is one particular scene involving an elevator you will love. Even Shredder, who's armor is a bit over the top, manages to preserve the character. I am hoping the next one will have a stronger plot, more turtle time, and less April, but until then I recommend checking out this instalment of our favorite Ninja Teenage Mutated Turtles.",1419379200,3,944,4.220994475138122

Michael Bay... if I ever see you again in person, I owe you a square kick to the balls. You suck, you have no idea how bad you are, and you have no right to take childhood stories that people love and hold in great nostalgia, and dump all over them like you do. Not everything needs CGI, explosions and all of that big-budget nonsense. If you would actually just focus on the characters themselves... you know, actual interactions, dialogue that's engaging and thought provoking, and making the characters likable (lovable even), you might actually discover that there is a talent to movie making, and not just a blank checkbook for you to vomit all over my childhood with.",1419292800,,888,4.887417218543046

They could have slowed down scenes with the turtles down in the sewer, everyone chimed in so quickly it was hard to distinguish who said what. Plus, they're so darn huge they fill the tv screen at every turn. The original turtles were cute, these ones are funky looking and they remind me of Charles Barkley, no offense CB. Shredder seemed to come right out of Transformers but was a menacing villain. I guarantee Michael Bay directed several scenes. Not a bad film but not your best slice of pizza either.

6329483,4,B00J2T18XS,"the movie was ok, i did enjoy most of it.  will arnett helped make this movie more enjoyable for me and the turtles weren't bad either.  i just wished there was more character interaction between the turtles and more scenes with them in it.  i think the all-cgi turtles film years back had more character development than this one.  for the record, for all its goofiness, the original is still my favorite(wish that one had a special edition release).

if you did like this version though, the target blu-ray/dvd special edition may be the one to go with.  you get:

*  feature film on blu-ray with special features, dvd copy, digital copy, and bonus blu-ray of extras.
*  your choice of a specific ninja turtle cover.  i thought leonardo looked the coolest, but i went with donatellos due to the extreme purple nature.
*  a target ticket rental offer.
*  a bonus blu ray disc of extras( about 30 minutes i think, haven't watched it yet)
*  a coupon for a free pizza/drink combo at target food avenue.  get it?  the turtles like pizza so they...oh nevermind.  you could probably peel this off in the store and redeem it without buying the movie, but that would probably be frowned upon by the turtles.
*  a free mask (mine was red despite me picking donatello).  i haven't torn it out of its plastic wrapper though cause this baby is going up on ebay for $200-300, so watch out for that turtle fans;)
*  that's about it.  i just wanted to see if you were paying attention or made it this far.

overall, 3-stars for movie rounded up to 4 for a very special edition which was on sale for $18 last week, and is now on sale for $15 this week at bullseye central!?!  price adjustment, here i come!",1419206400,,1692,4.425324675324675

First I was apprehensive but I thought that it would have some funny moments and so good action scenes sprinkled in...I was wrong on both notions. Let's start with what's good about this movie(silence)...Ok, let's move on to what's wrong. The most glaring negative about the movie is the appearance of the turtles. They're teenagers but for some reason look like the turtle versions of Brock Lesner. It's not only the appearance of the turtles which is off putting but it's also their costume design which comes across as just odd, they dress like walking flee markets. Rafael for instance wears sunglasses that sit on the top of his head and chews on a toothpick throughout the whole movie, yes a toothpick! But it's not just the turtles that look weird but it's also Splinter. Splinter who looks asian but talks with this weird ""Keanu Reeves doing an asian accent"" accent. The story is nonsensical and the action scenes are forgettable. I think even the people responsible for the movie knew that this was a stinker because there is no set up for a sequel at all. Believe me, this movie makes Man of Steele look like Dark Knight.",1419206400,,1177,4.636363636363637

This is still a movie geared towards kids and I expected it to be that way so in the end, I'm not disappointed. I get the feeling that the only adults who will enjoy this movie are those who grew up on the original TMNT cartoons.

Story is pretty straight-forward, with nothing majorly spectacular in terms of the action sequences or acting.  However, I loved the way that the creators worked the relationships and interactions between the turtles and their rodent master - true to the original feel of their characters and highly entertaining.  Don't expect anything great in terms of ground-breaking cinema or you'll be highly disappointed.

And the Turtles didn't have their own personalities like they did in the cartoon, they had a part of it, but something was missing. And there in lies the key. You can't change that much of the story, can't change that much of the characters and the baseline of the history of the characters and not lose to much precious gems that made the TMNT what they were in the first place.

Also splinter not being human first was a letdown for me.

Everything about this... thing speaks to a rushed writing process by people who had never read the original source material and, most likely, had no love for the previous incarnations of this franchise.

Pros: Watching Splinter fight

Cons: Megan Fox (but we already knew she was going to be bad, but if we don't cont her there's plenty of other cons)
Turtles look ridiculous (use technology, and have lips!?!)
Shredder is too flashy, looks like a transformer, has like twenty weapons on his arms?
Movie was too flashy (like Batman Forever, when it should be darker like Batman Returns)
The foot clan uses guns (They're suppose to be ninjas)
The story doesn't follow the true background to the turtles. Even the one they come up with is boring and predictable

6329614,4,B00J2T18XS,I was a kid when TMNT started in the 80s and I was excited to check out this new version.  It was a good movie but I still prefer the original when a moment of turtle nostalgia strikes.,1418774400,,185,3.8684210526315788
6329615,1,B00J2T18XS,Hot garbage. Megan Fox was a terrible choice but then again so was Michael Bay. They shouldn't be allowed to associate this with the original movies.,1418774400,,149,4.769230769230769

6329617,4,B00J2T18XS,"I liked this film, but of course it did have it's short comings. I was never a big fan of the turtles series, but they were a part of my childhood (my friends and culture fully embraced them). If you are a big turtle fan then do not watch this film, cause chances are that it will disappoint you. Yes, the writers and director changed the story around. SPOILER ALERT in this film version April has been connected to the turtles since before they mutated (her father helped to mutate them in his lab, and April fed them/video recorded them/saved them from a lab fire.). It is only after April had her first encounter (face to face) with the turtles that she ended up in their den. It was then revealed to her that she had helped the turtles and Splinter escape certain death when they were still  simple animals (before they mutated in the sewers). Another change to the traditional story was that Splinter learned how to love the turtles through observing April (who loved them while they were still in her father's lab). Also, Splinter learned martial arts through the use of a discarded book that he found in the sewers.
The acting is not the greatest. However, it is not the worst either. It took some time for me to accept the woman who played the role of April. The dialogue could be a little flat sometimes, and also a little PG. For example, Mike (orange turtle) flirts with April, and at times in a very aggressive way. One time he said ""we may be teenagers, but that doesn't mean we can't have adult conversations."" Will this bother you as a parent???? I can't say? Take this test to find out. If you would allow your child to watch the old Biker Mice From Mars TV show (for those who still remember it- 1993- how Vinnie always was flirting with the human Charlie). If you answered, ""yes I would,"" then let your children watch this turtle movie. Also, occasionally there are some PG insults. One of them being, ""numb n-ts.""
Personally, as an adult on some level I enjoyed this film. Of course, I had no expectations walking into it. I just accepted it for what it was. I have to admit, this is the first time that I really liked the design of the turtles/ and their attire. They came across as hardcore heroes, and I liked it. Although, I wish the director/ writers would have developed their personalities a little more (not so 2D at times). Also, Shreder was a little too much...too much metal...too much looking like a transformer. In my opinion they could have toned his appearance down...he looked like an intentional toy ad. However, the director had the turtle huge in size, so I guess he felt that Shreder had to be even bigger/tougher looking. Also, Splinter looked freaky weird! I could not get into his character at all, he was too ugly for my taste. He had big black shark eyes...weird.
This movie will entertain your children, and or your young teenagers. There is no s-x or major blood scenes, so that is a plus for a parent. As for a huge turtle fan, I doubt you will love this film, but I could be wrong. I would suggest sticking with the original 1990 turtle film. If you are someone like myself, who is curious about this film, and was never a huge turtle fan then watch it without any expectations. As I had said, I had enjoyed it enough where I could watch it again. It was an action adventure film without a lot of R rated elements to it.",1418688000,,3368,4.432258064516129

That movie was most certainly a kids movie but, guess what? I didn't want to gouge my eyes out every second I looked at my TV while it was on as I did with this latest TMNT movie.

6329639,3,B00J2T18XS,"Having read or watched some form of TMNT for a number of years, I can truly say this movie simply exists for money making reasons. There isn't any intrinsic value other than a cash cow situation, and in that regard, it was quite successful.

That said, I wanted to see it for giggles and grins. With that in mind, I kept the bar ridiculously low to the point I felt it was a good enough watch to kill part of my Friday night. Sure, it's terribly done with dialogue that makes the ""50 Shades,"" series seem like Pulitzer Prize written stuff. The weak plot and overall butchering of the origin turns this TMNT into a shell of their former selves.

But I digress. I am far from the pinpoint age group this is movie is aiming for, because ultimately, it's for the kids.

Don't expect substance beyond what's being flashed on screen; yeah, there's enough ADHD rummaging through the whole movie, that I am surprised I didn't go all epileptic watching it.

Despite my overwhelming reasons against this flick, I found it oddly entertaining and somewhat endearing, bad acting and all. Yes, among the piles and piles of angry reviews, you're not going to find a movie that has something that hasn't been said or written by the disgruntled.

Catch it if you happen to have a few bucks to spare on a rental night. Or, if you want to go full Jackass via Johnny Knoxville, why not bypass the coal, and use this movie as your stocking stuffer for that very naughty person on your Xmas list.

It's laughable either way.",1418515200,6,1502,4.5036764705882355

WTF!!! Putting this aside, there are some serious duds in the movie that just land flat.

6329694,4,B00J2T18XS,I grew up with the original TMNT movies and was excited to hear about this one. I preferre the original but this version was pretty entertaining. Worth watching for new or old fans.,1418083200,,181,4.515151515151516
6329695,1,B00J2T18XS,"I, for one, had no positive expectations for this film. Hearing the words TMNT and Michael Bay in the same sentence killed any hope that this film would have even the thinnest of silver linings.

And it seems I was right. This movie has everything a movie shouldn't. Lapses in plot and script, bad dialogue, dreadful casting, bad acting, lazy editing, an excessive use of CGI and an almost constant emphasis on crude humor and sexuality. It's the closest Hollywood will ever get to making a PG-13 rated porno marketed towards children.

The film may be called ""Ninja Turtles"", but it's really Megan Fox's movie and she does not make the most of it. The turtles don't even make an appearance until 50 minutes into the film, and their personalities are even more shallow than their cartoon counterparts. The villains are devoid of appeal and their presence is oftentimes superfluous. Most comic/action movies seek redemption in the 3rd act when the heroes and villains have their final battle. This movie's  showdown is poorly executed and painfully devoid of interest.

The whole experience was like having a root canal. I can't recommend this to TMNT fans because it only has the most vague similarities to the source material. And I can't recommend it for kids due to it's boring pace, length, emphasis on the wrong characters and excessive use of innuendo. As a gift, I strongly recommend buying the 1990 classic instead. It has withstood the test of time and it remains superior to this modern trainwreck in every conceivable way.",1418083200,9,1533,4.884615384615385
6329696,1,B00J2T18XS,"First off I did not like the CGI of the turtles so you have some bias from the get go. They just do not look realistic and the muscles are even badly proportioned. Not really any redeeming traits. Secondly when you finally see Shredder, well he looks like a transformer and has missiles amongst other things. In the plot he does not even make sense.

I will try to keep this spoiler free.

First off this seemed like it was going to be based more on the Nickelodeon show which I do not like. Why they had to Donatello a massive crush on April, I will never know, or why she is a teenager in that series either. This movie however is just as far off from the original story as that show.

It seems Michael Bay cannot have a story that flows well no matter what. I think he is against the idea as the plot makes no sense. During one scene they would have to have been traveling near the speed of light to get to where they needed to be next. The scene they left from was just to show off CGI and create more action. However it made no sense and was badly done.

This movie is not even all that great for kids. They might like to see a movie based of a show they watch on cable now, but the movie is a bit dark and the characters are lost. None of the turtles really represent themselves all that well in this movie. They more or less are just there. None of the jokes are all that funny either. April is also clearly there for nothing more than sex appeal as her point to the plot is a little insane. Like recognizing her lost pets after they have mutated many years later and a villain from a tragic point in her life. Most people do not remember tragedy all the clearly. Our minds are not designed that way.

The only way to enjoy this is either to be such a fan of the Turtles that you can ignore the story and not care about the plot or story which honestly pushes it away from the original story and makes it something that is no longer the Turtles. Even some character names have been changed. Or you could be someone who only wants to see action and not care about the story. Finally you could be someone who just cares if your kid thought it was a good movie or not.

While not as bad for kids say as Victoria Justice and things like Drake and Josh or most of those live action kids shows that teach horrible behavior, this still is not what I would consider a good kids film. As for action flicks I definitely have other titles and even the first TMNT film released years ago.",1418083200,3,2483,4.119834710743802
6329697,3,B00J2T18XS,"Big fan of almost everything TMNT, most of all the first 2 movies. I gave this movie a fair chance knowing that it would be different from the originals and I was ok with that fact.

The best thing about this film is the CGI. I also like the new look of the turtles and the fact that they have super human strength. Good additions.

The bad thing about this film: the story, plot and unexplained/underdeveloped characters.

Fans of TMNT will have no issues following the characters since we already know the backgrounds (with the exception of some new story additions). New to the franchise? Watch the original movies since this reboot is all over the place.

Kids will undoubtedly love this film, long time fans will not.

Giving this movie 3 stars only because I am a fan of the franchise and because I will be adding it to my collection when released.

6329732,4,B00J2T18XS,"OK..about this movie.. This movie has the SAME ISSUE as the PT(prequal Trilogy) of the star wars franchise.
NO i'm not talking about the issues with the movie we will get to those.
The problem is the fanbase...its very, VERY polarized. Either you love it.. or you hate it. Either way people seem to want to foist their opinions on other fans.
Unfortunately this can have an effect of ruining the film for others.
Now I will state that this is LITTERALLY my first exposure to TMNT. Other than the current comics. Please keep that in mind as you read this review.
Now then I will state that this IS SOLELY MY PERSONAL opinion of the film, if you disagree fine, but please try to be mature.
1) Story wise, It honestly follows whats been set forth in the new comics pretty closely with the addition of the Sacks character.
The story line with the baddies needing the blood of the heroes was established in the comics, the only change being that, in the comics they were after splinter's blood not the TMNT's. But that was established and followed the story line if not to the T, then pretty closely. This is something that most people that saw the storyline for the movie seem to not know. Granted unless you have read the comics, i can see why. It is a lil rushed seems like in some parts, but that may have been due to issues with the writers for both IDW comics, and Nicolodeon having communication errors.
There is in fact room for character development, but keep in mind Fichner, all of the mocap actors, and the girl that played April have all signed contracts for possibly as many as FOUR movies so there is room for growth and development.
Over all i can see where there is room for improvement but i don't feel that it is the glaring disaster that many claim. Again this could just be due to my being familiar with the current comics and that plot line being some what obscure.
2) the actual animation was great. They for all intents and purposes Look REAL. I can see where the folks that designed this look for the TMNT's took the time to research anatomy and did they best they could to find a design that could at least theorectically work. The size difference between the current TMNT's and the original has been an issue with many of those who saw the movie. As an artist my self, having had anatomy beat in my my own head with a stick for four years in college, i can see what the concept artists and cg artists were attempting to do and for the most part i feel that they were sucessful.
3) Megan Fox: Well ok.. i have to admit... She;s a wee bit stiff. THen again.. keep in mind that she is not acting with the turtles there on screen. OK? Shes talking to four guys in grey pajamas, with cardboard shells on their back, their faces covered in lil dots, and ping pong balls attached to their heads. the fact that shes able to keep a straight face and actually act is a testimony to the fact that she can do so at least a little bit. I would be laughing my head off and unable to keep acting at all if it were me. So i am inclined to cut the woman a bit of slack. I th ink she will get better as time goes on.
4) over all. I think its a decent movie.
It could be better but I like it and think its good. I will enjoy this movie for what it is.. a fun reboot of an old franchise.
I will give the ones that come in the future the same chance i gave this one.
I hope every one else out there can see past the polarization and give this movie the chance it deserves.

They clearly pulled a lil influence from every other TMNT Universe (original comics, 80s cartoon, new IDW comics etc) and that's my biggest reason for loving this movie.
If you take issue with the origin of the Turtles in this movie, I doubt you have read any of the current comic series. Nothing wrong with that, but I think it would add a bit of perspective. I love that they did something different for a change.
The only reason I won't give 5 stars is because they really dropped the ball on Shredder. The flick could have been 30 minutes longer for sure.  Hopefully that is something they will cover in the sequel.  Also, for the sequel, can we finally get the Utroms in a Turtles movie for Christ's sake!?
In closing- TMNT is a fun movie with more action than plot, which does Hinder what could have been a great story. It's a nice movie to watch and just disconnect from life for a hour and a half. It's funny, witty and looks amazing. Definitely recommend.",1417651200,,1118,4.396135265700483

6329756,4,B00J2T18XS,"And now a review from a guy who grew up with the original turtles cartoon and movies:

I finally got around to watching this, and I have to say that even though I have some complaints I totally approve.

As an adult I have gone back and watch every iteration of the ""Green Machine"" and I have also read the old and new comics series. So I am well versed on turtles.

The origin story is that of the most current run of comics by Image, but the movie cuts out the mystic reincarnation aspect leaving no real reason for Splinter to be at odds against the Shredder. So, no Yoshi vs Saki rivalry. I don't even think they mention those names in the movie. Splinter is just inherently good and is against Shedder because he is evil.

The voice talent for the turtles is excellent, but I have misgivings on the voice of Splinter. I like Tony Shalhoub, and he has a great voice but I just wanted some more ""Asian wisdom"" in the voice of Splinter.

The action is over the top, as is any Bay film, but it's fun and silly in the appropriate spots.

My major hang-up is on the styling of the TMNT, Splinter, and the Shredder. The turtles are just too big. In the comics and toons they have never been over 5 feet and now they are all 6 plus if not 7. I guess Bay felt the need to pump them up to compete with today's version of heroes that all resemble Norse or Greek gods. What I liked so much about them as a kid was that they were small and they could still bring down the big guys because the worked together as brothers. That being said, Bay does a good job of keeping the brotherhood important. My favorite part is when Raph gives a speech about his brothers towards the end. Nearly made me cry, and I can't say that about any of the other movies.

Shredder is just crazy over the top, but I guess if you amp up the heroes you got to roid out the villain as well. Its like he bought a life-time supply of knives off QVC latenight and had to have them all attacked to one set of armor that is itself grafted onto a mech frame. And I don't get how the blades are recalled to him without attracting every other piece of metal around.

As for splinter, Sensei needs some Rogaine. When they show his pre-mutated form he is a fully haired lab rat. After mutating it looks like he bathes in Nair, except for a patch on his head he puts into a topknot.

I was pleasantly surprised by Fox, as April. She did a good job. She wasn't asked to do much, but she did portrayed the character well. They even have her working for the right news station.

This was a good way to introduce my four green BFs from childhood to the next generation. The other three live action films weren't masterpieces, and neither was this. What they are is a good time. I welcome this addition to the TMNT world.",1417478400,2,2772,4.174157303370786

I didn't like the re-designs of the turtles and some of the ""superpower"" like abilities it gave them, but overall it is entertaining if you grew up on the original series, and if you have kids, I'm sure they will like it.",1417478400,,471,4.329545454545454

6329806,2,B00J2T18XS,"There are not too many good things about this movie. Will Arnett & Megan Fox were fine, their performances did not kill the movie. I will just mention the storyline because the ""Look"" of the these turtles has already been mentioned by so many others. The story line and the character development is much weaker when compared to original TMNT. Within the first couple scenes of the original, we had Raph and Splinter share a very powerful moment, one that distinguishes Splinter as not just their ""Sensei"" but as a wise loving father. Raph is the hot head but is also shows a vulnerable side to him.

Here is Splinter's portion, "" You will listen now. My Master Yoshi's first rule was ""Possess the right thinking."" Only then can one recieve the gifts of strength, knowledge, and peace. I have tried to channel your anger, Raphael, but more remains. Anger clouds the mind. Turned inward it is an unconquerable enemy. You are unique among your brothers, for you choose to face this enemy alone. But as you face it, do not forget them, and do not forget me. I am here, my son. ""

This dynamic, Raph confronting his anger, the bonds the brothers have, the possibility of letting go of Splinter is what makes the story great in the Original. It seems like the new Turtles movie is more focused on giving the turtles lips and CGI rather then telling a modernized story.",1417305600,,1362,4.577868852459017

Also, what was the point of changing their origin? It didn't make it any better or more believable. All the origin change did was add to the plot that was oddly similar to The Amazing Spider-Man's Lizard storyline.

6329815,2,B00J2T18XS,"Its not very good at all. Its actually pretty terrible. Especially the acting, the visual effects, the story, the fact that it rips off The Amazing Spider-man, pretty much all of it really. Shredder is about as one dimensional of a villain as it gets in this movie. The foot clan is not much of a threat at all. Nothing the NYPD couldn't deal with. They certainly aren't ninjas, just thugs with guns. The plot is predictable. unoriginal, and just bad. Not to mention all the inconsistencies in the film. For example: in the movie the turtles are now, for some reason, bulletproof (so far as I know, that has NEVER been the case) how ever, one of the villains in the film manages to capture the turtles and draw their blood for his evil scheme using nothing more than a medical needle. Shredder looks like a rip off of the Silver Samurai from the Wolverine with a little of Bay's Megatron. The CG is horrible. Some scenes look okay but others are just terribly bad to the point that its distracting. Especially the scenes involving the turtles as kids. I can't believe people actually enjoyed this cluster of poop. The CG is so bad, that a lot of the fight scenes are just blurry. You can't make out what's going on, or who's fighting who. Oh and not to mention the countless bestiality jokes....those wore thin. I literally didn't laugh once the whole movie. I mostly sad there shaking my head at the unoriginality, the painfully bad dialog, and mostly the horrifyingly bad visual effects. I understand why they went with CG instead of the traditional guys in suits with animatronic masks routine. But the issue with making your lead characters CG is, unless they're done right, it just doesn't work. Its distracting. Jar Jar Binks looks better than any scenes involving the turtles, and that movie came out about 15 years ago. The visual effects are even worse than the ones in Green Lantern. I actually prefer that crap fest to this s***. In the end, if you're intent on seeing the film, just download it. For free. Save your $$.

If you are looking to introduce your children to characters you know and love from your youth then go for it, but if you were expecting to enjoy it yourself you may be disappointed. The titular characters do not even appear for well over half an hour. This movie should be called April O'Neil (or maybe just Meagan Fox).

I do enjoy the turtles and their new look, but the story was horrible, the plot ridiculous and the acting, mediocre. This movie had so much potential to be great, even with the changes made.

The action scenes were awesome, escpeially the one-on-one fights and a scene in the mountains of upstate New York.  An overall genuinely fun film, especially if you grew up with the Turtles.

Here's what it got wrong: The storyline was weak, too many coincidences and a slight altering of the Turtles' history.  Megan Fox was an absolutely terrible April O'Neil.  I have nothing against Fox and when matched with the right role she's fine, but she gave a bad performance.

Meanwhile, fledgling TV reporter April O'Neil (Megan Fox), seeking her big break, is determined to get the story on the Foot Clan's next move when she accidentally stumbles upon a set of vigilantes in the form of man-sized, teenage mutant turtles who have been living and learning martial arts in the sewers below the city by their master, Splinter (a morphed rat with a heart of gold) ... and may be the city's only hope.  By far the best thing about the film are the turtles themselves; Michelangelo, Donatello, Raphael and Leonardo have never looked better, or been more fully-realized.  But a weak, predictable script overly reliant on outrageous action sequences via producer Michael ""overkill"" Bay, and bad casting via Fox and (even worse) Will Arnett, all work to drag down what could have been a great film to a serviceable feature ... still worth watching just for the turtles themselves.",1416873600,2,1019,4.713483146067416

I could understand if it was meant to improve it but this is horrendous!  Gone is the revenge,  gone is the brotherhood. Also gone is the loving father to 4 sons. Gone is the respect, the honor.

6329894,1,B00J2T18XS,"I Grew up watching the 80'S cartoon series of TMNT
and then i loved the film that was released in 1990, and i still enjoy watching the 1990 version actually

this remake is s*** in so many ways, and i am not surprised that it did poorly at the box office
 i think it only had a limited run at the Theaters so i'm not surprised at all
that most fans hated it
this remake is not a CGI cartoon film it's suppose to be a Movie remake of the 1990 film
and the remake failed miserably break open the champagne

first of all the Turtles in this 2014 remake, all 4 of them are all Computer Generated
with Actors doing Voiceovers
they're personality's are so stupid and silly it's insulting from a fans point of view
where is the Turtles in the 1990 Live action version had Actors in Turtle costumes
very Good actors in Turtle costumes which is massive difference in performance
compared to the Voiceover actors for the CGI Turtles

2nd reason it failed
Megan Fox as April O'neil, poor choice to cast her
the Producers only cast her for the role cause she's Hot looking really, yes she is Drop Dead Hot
But just because she's Hot Looking does not mean she can Act the role.
Big Difference.
i think Judith Hoag who played April O'neil in the 1990 version Acted the character very well
better than Megan Fox
Megan started as a model trying to be an actor
it's a matter of opinion really

3rd reason is the storyline which is average aswell
and i'm sure there are more reasons why this remake was not successful

this new remake of the film is more suited to new Generation of fans of the TMNT
that do not know any better when they see the CGI Turtles and get excited.

for me i still love the 1990 Live action version
Great acting performances in the Turtle costumes, Great Directing by Steve barron
Great script aswell
each to their own i Guess, if you like this remake i think there's somethin' wrong with you
it is a terrible remake.

Any true fan would be able to accept a bit of change see this was not a bad film. Those looking for perfection need to seriously grow up. This was not near perfection but the main characters were completely accurate within personalities and actions as well as supporting characters (though origins not explain thoroughly enough) were still accurate. The story was accurate enough though also unexplained in some matters. Like the full origin of the ooz. People don't understand the accuracy of the story really is not in question and is actually more accurate then most people assumed, its just unexplained. The movie was 100 mins long though and that's almost 2 hours. I as a fan would have liked a 2 hour at least but still not bad. Not everything was explained however this in no way makes this a bad movie. A modernized version of the turtles we know and love (shredder more then them though).

I've been raised on every media version of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and if someone is complaining that it is not like the movies of the 1990's or the show of the 1980's then they are right. Every version of TMNT did not stay true to the original comics. Instead each was its own perspective on the turtles. There are some valid points on some of the characters like Karai who is a major kick ass in her previous incarnations but not so much in this film. While I can admit that the Foot Clan was not all that the turtles certainly made up for it. The film had a combination of humor, action, and heart. And as for the other reviews saying that the only action scene was the snow scene, no it was not. In fact the plot of the movie seemed to echo some of the plot lines from the 1990's TMNT Trilogy. It was nice to see that as well as modern interpretations of the Turtles, by the way Mikey was hilarious and my favorite turtle was all of them. I didn't expect much from Nickelodeon after the disaster of The Last Airbender movie but this movie did not disappoint. The story is simple but it manages to hit the main points and theme of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Don't go in with extreme expectations, just watch it for the fun of it.

Shredder looked like an extra from the recent Transformers movies. By making the shredder armor look so bulky, it makes it ridiculous in the fight scenes. The armor makes it difficult to stay in the moment. They definitely set it up so that sequels can be forthcoming.

I am 31 and I have grown up with the turtles from the comics up to the terrible live tv show in the late 90's with the girl turtle. The turtles have been a huge part of my life. I say this easily when I say that this reboot was more than any true fan could have expected. Throughout the entire movie they pay homage to the comics, cartoons, and so on. The humor and turtles interaction was hilarious. Besides the incredible suit, you get the feel that The Shredder is a force to be reckoned with, before you ever see him in the suit on screen. The CGI made it easier for better fight scenes and action to be pulled off compared to the stiff suits and animatronics in the 90s. Megan Fox was not great but she didn't hurt the movie either. If you loved the old comics, movies, and old cartoons, then you should love this. Guaranteed that 90% of the bad reviews came from people that already decided they hated the movie way before it came out because Michael Bays name was attached to it, the 10% were people who just genuinely didn't care for it, nothing wrong with that. People need to get off of Bays back. Transformers series is very good. He also gave us Bad Boys series, The Rock, Armageddon, and the new instant classic, under rated and over looked Pain & Gain.

6329912,2,B00J2T18XS,"I went into this thinking it would probably be a little bit better than what the reviews suggest. Just based on the nostalgia factor alone, I thought this movie would at least be a 7 out of 10 for me. Unfortunately this movie is extremely dull, boring, and has bad acting.

Megan Fox is terrible. It's like she took an online acting class that taught her how to say lines convincingly, but since it's only an online class, one very essential part of the lesson was missed: FACIAL EXPRESSIONS. She can speak (I guess), but she can't emote with her face.

Let's stop for a second, I'm going to quote a line from my review of the first Transformers movie from 2007, so you can see a theme here:

""...that girl couldn't act at all. Look at the moment(s) where she encounters the Transformers. Instead of looking shocked and in complete disbelief at seeing a several story tall live robot, she has the same expression you would have if you saw someone at work, who you previously could've sworn had the day off, but you see them at work anyway. She had that SAME subtle look.""

I guess she took a couple more online acting classes since then, since she upgraded her facial expressions for this movie. This time, instead of looking like she's wondering if her co-worker had the day off, when she encounters unbelievable things in this movie that for anyone else would've been HORRIFIC, she looks like someone who's troubled at not having any vacation days left for the year, and so is pondering if they should just call off next Monday and hopefully not get in trouble.

The first time she meets the turtles, she doesn't look appropriately shocked. When she goes on that rooftop, she essentially sees a monster. That's what they are. For all intents and purposes, these turtles would appear to you as monsters. So she meets these talking green monsters, who are no shorter than 6'3'' , but she just has the SAME stupid expression of *mild concern*. She also didn't scream. At all. I don't care who you are, if you're a woman, meeting four very tall green MONSTERS with dangerous WEAPONS, you're going to scream. But not Megan Fox, she just has the face of someone who's sorry that a very distant cousin she never met passed away.

**Splinter looked weird in this movie. His eyes were a bit TOO rodent-like and realistic, those perfect black orbs that were his eyes. Very unsettling.

**I don't like the minimal amount of martial arts done in this movie. Most of the fight scenes consisted of the turtles brute forcing their way through their opponents. Off the top of my head, the only impressive shot was when Mikey did some jumping attack with his nunchucks and took out two people before he tripped or something. Everything else was just punches, and throwing bad guys against walls.

**When April is first ""kidnapped"" by the turtles, and had the mask put on her head, why wasn't she afraid?? Shouldn't she show a BIT of concern? Sure, she doesn't really see these monsters as necessarily a threat, but even then, you just had a mask put over your head by monsters, you should at the very least ask ""WHERE ARE WE GOING?"" All of Megan Fox's interactions with the turtles are just so SUBDUED, as if she's too cool to play it as a fidgety, scared person. As if she's too cool to open her eyes really wide to show fear, and move her body in jumpy ways to look like someone who's in disbelief at meeting a talking green MONSTER. When Leo put his arm around her, she didn't even care that much.

**I didn't like how in typical cartoon like fashion, all of April's co-workers mocked and ridiculed her story when she tried to explain herself. When does that EVER happen? Your close buddy might rib you, but when does an entire office laugh AT you, and not with you?? Play that out in your mind as you in your own workplace, and you'll see how ridiculous this movie trope is.

**When April called Whoopi Goldberg over to show her the ""evidence,"" why didn't she show her the cellphone picture of the turtles??? Why START OFF the explanation with a pin up picture of a real turtle on the wall and point to it and say that's the vigilante? OF COURSE Whoopi Goldberg is not going to believe you!!!! She already laughed your story off the first time, what makes you think you seem any MORE credible now??

**I hated how the ending pretty much gave April a very important role in the bad guy's defeat. I would've rather seen the turtles be able to accomplish this on their own.

Ugh, I can't see this franchise getting any better. To this day, the only good live action turtles movie was the original, I gave that a 10 out of 10, because that actually had a purposeful narrative and non-offensive acting.",1414886400,5,4686,4.526004728132388
6329913,2,B00J2T18XS,"Let's see, where do I start with this one? First off, let me just say that I have been a TMNT fan since the 1987 TV series and am espacially a fan of the original Mirage comic books, and while this movie gives some nods to those and the 90's movies I was not entirely thrilled with it. I won't say that the acting was terrible but they should have cast someone else as April. I was rooting for Jane Levy myself because, not only is she actually a red head but she is probably also a better actor than Megan Fox (and a hellova lot cuter). The turtles and Shredder look absolutly sick but I was not thrilled with Splinter's design and the CGI for Splinter and the turtles could have been done a little better because it looked kind of rushed which made it seem cheap. They should have gone with Casey Jones as April's love intrest here, I mean c'mon, how can you have a TMNT movie without Casey? (Vernon Fenwick? Really?!) Most of all there is hardly a plot to this movie: they used the newer IDW origin story for this which I don't mind to much because I just read up on it and it sounds really good, so why did they have to screw it up? (Splinter learns martial arts from a picture book? Really?!) They jump straight into the action which isn't usually a problem but they could have put in an explaination for it. There is no explaination for the rivalry between Splinter and Shredder, it's almost as if Shredder was simply thrown in for the sake of authenticity, he just...is, and he is not referred to as Oroku Saki here either. The main villain here is some guy named Eric Sachs who is supposedly Shredder's adopted son (Say what?! Since when?!?!) and was dreamed up specifically for this train wreck. Karai makes an appearance but is never referred to by name and, in fact, we don't know if she survived the chase down the mountain so, yeah, worthless. Dr. Stockman is here but only has a background bit part along with TMNT co-creator Kevin Eastman as a fellow scientist, again, worthless. The evil sceme here was lame: spreading a deadly illness through out Manhatten and offering the mutagen as a miracle cure-all? Um, whatever. Finally Mikey's humor is funny at first but after a while he just gets plain annoying. A little bit of comedy on the turtles' part is okay since they are teenagers after all, but there is such a thing as to much comedy (don't forget, the original comic book was very dark and edgy. Violence, profanity, blood, all that good stuff and usually very serious with a hint of humor from Mikey every now and then. It was perfect). There was no character development either so they didn't have much depth and there was to much script editing which should be obvious, we have all glimpsed a scene of Raph sneaking into the news van in his Fedora and trench coat disguise, so where was it in the finished movie? I did like the theme song ""Shell Shocked"" by Kill The Noise and Madsonik, it's pretty cool and the score is okay. Over all, whether you want to waste your hard earned cash on this is up to you but I would stick with the original 1990 movie, it was and remains the absolute best one so far. Let's hope the sequel to this one turns out a lot better.",1414886400,,3185,4.372681281618887

6329922,2,B00J2T18XS,"The movie's focus is mostly on April O' Neill(Megan Fox- Transformers, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen,  Jennifer's Body) and Vernon Fenwich(Will Arnette- The Brother's Solomon, Tv's Arrested Development, RV, The Nut Job) who are news reporting partners.  April is a beautiful and eager reporter who gets to do reports that are not terribly to her liking.  Vernon seems to just go with the flow, also he has an uncontrollable crush on April.  Their boss(Whoopi Goldberg) will neither hear April out nor give her any breaks.

In the meantime New York City is plagued by a crime syndicate known as ""The Foot Clan"".  April fully eager to get a good story talks to a grumpy and reluctant construction worker and Eric Sacks(William Fictner- Go, Tv's Grace Under Fire, Drive Angry) a local poitician who promises to clean up New York City.  Sacks knew April when she was a little girl and (even then) an aspiring news reporter.  He was friends with her scientist father also.  Of course, the Foot Clan is made up of Shredder and his Foot Soldiers and for some reason some random Japanese woman with red streaks in her hair, whose name and significance are left unknown.

The turtles's rat sensei Splinter turns out to be an abrasive an unlikable character who's temperament is rather strict with no sense of humor and for no clear reason he can grab whomever he's beating up with his tail.  That's just plain ridiculous!
Furthermore he doesn't even look like a rat, he just looks like a cross between a camel and a wildebeest.  Whatever happened to the more zen, wisecracking, and lovable Splinter that we know and love?  As for the Turtles well they're all too creepy looking, ugly as anything, they're kind of abrasive and incredibly unlikable(you can see where they get that from), they're charmless, they're not particularly developed as characters, and worst of all they don't even remotely look like turtles.  While their rebellious nature is still kept intact, their fun and campy stereotypical personalities are severely butchered.  Leonardo doesn't show much in the way of competence as a leader, Raphael is a cold-hearted punk, Donatello is still a nerdy scientist type, but, it's only played upon lightly and to make matters worse he wears geeky glasses with the center frame taped together, and Michaelangelo rather than being a fun-loving Southern California surfer turtle type, instead they made him a hip-hop turtle.  Also, for no clear rhyme or reason the heights of the Turtles are not all the same. For example, Michaelangelo is the shortest one.  These changes to the Turtles are both absurd and unacceptable to the point of embarrassing.

What transpires is April's first attempt at a story leads her to a dock at night where the Foot are doing who knows what and when we already know that the Turtles are beating them up and April not only doesn't get a good picture of them, but her boss is unimpressed in general.  The second time around the Foot wish to draw the Turtles out so they go to a subway, take random people hostage including April and place several bombs accross the walls.  Well, in the nick of time they answer the challenge and beat the bad guys once again.  This time April goes through alot to follow them to a rooftop and takes a coulple of pics of them.  Well, they spot April and for some unacceptible reason they threaten her.  That's not only unfunny but unbecoming of the Turtles!

Eventually April has a past childhood memory of the turtles and of Splinter.  She finally meets Splinter and is fully introduced to Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michaelangelo.  She gets their history which wasn't as well presented as in the original movie.

I'm not clear as to how but somehow the Foot Clan used some sort of computer or something and found the Turtles's lair in the sewer and wasted no time charging in with guns and some sort of cattle prod like objects.  The Turtles and Splinter fought pretty well with the Foot Soldiers but when Shredder invaded it was up to Splinter to fight with him.  That was the only exciting fight sequence in the whole movie.  As Raphael had the lair fall on him, Splinter commands the other three turtles to get in the elevator and leave and even more Shredder after beating Splinter commands them to drop their weapons.  Well after a struggle with Shredder leading to the capture of the other three turtles it's up to Raphael to come to April for help while April needs Vernon to come meet her with the news van.  No sooner does Vernon arrive that she introduces him to Raphael.

Spoiler Alert:  A plot point unknown until much later is about to be revealed.  If you don't wish to know about it before watching the movie, I would recommend skipping the following paragraph.

As it turns out Sacks was in league with Shredder the whole time, all because when Sacks lived in Japan with no family to see to him, Shredder took him in and got him on his side.  Sacks was responsible for April's fathers death which was vaguely explained.  What was clearly explained is that somehow her father knew that Sacks was in league with Shredder and attempted to set fire to his experiments and information on them so that Shredder could never carry out his evil plans.  While that happened when she was a little girl still April grabs the four turtles and rat that her father ran the experiments on to make the what they become, and redlined them to safety.  Once Sacks has Shredder beat Splinter and kidnap the turtles(which turns out to be 3 out 4 of them unintentionally)so that he could extract the mutagen from them, cause the people of New York City to get sick, and then present a cure so that he can both come off like a hero and make lots of money.  Well after April and Vernon's difficult struggle with Sacks the turtles in their weakened state inform April to turn up the adrenaline that the machine offers to save them.  She raises their adrenaline and then their pursuance of Sacks and Shredder continues.
End of spoiler.

Without giving away the ending let's just say that the Turtles, April, and Vernon have a tough fight on their hands.  Will they succeed?  All I can say is their is quite a race against time for them.

In closing, the Turtles and Splinter were changed way too much, April O'Neill is developed too much as a character, whereas none of the four Turtles nor Splinter get to be developed at all, just flat and one-dimensional, the same is the case with Shredder, of whom for some reason's real name is never mentioned once, also the bitter rivalry between Shredder and Splinter just isn't used this time, for some reason, William Fictner's performance as Sacks is lousy in that he just phoned it in, Whoopi Goldberg looked less than thrilled to be in this movie, who could blame her, I can appreciate that unlike the egotistical, obnoxious, brown-nosing, and cowardly creep that Vernon Fenwich was in the cartoon in this movie they made him much cooler and likable albeit somewhat sleazy.  Will Arnette did an amazing job in his performance all the same.  Megan Fox did a decent job as April O'Neill.  I can't help but wonder as to what was with the Foot Soldiers in this movie.  In the cartoon they were just kung fu robots with laser guns,  in the original movie they were a bunch of angsty teen kids that Shredder trains hard and corrupts,  in this version all they amount to are faceless people in dark outfits sporting blank masks, cattle prods, and guns.  That's just unacceptable, Foot Soldiers using guns?! Really?!  What were they even thinking?  The original was campy, funny, and had stronger character development, while this version spent more time on the action, 3-d moments, and overhead shots rather than developing the characters more.

P.S. I recommend just sticking with the original Jim Henson version from 1990, it's sequel from 1991, and as for part 3 from 1993, I wouldn't recommend that one, but well to each his own.  As for this version well, I would say once is more than enough.",1414108800,8,8003,4.704953338119167

6329927,3,B00J2T18XS,"They tried. Let me start with that. They did a darn good attempt. The brothers were GREAT! Splinter was cool. And Shredder was AWESOME! With that said, they did screw up some. One of my biggest problems were it was boring. The fights were cool but other than that was very hit or miss. The time with the turtles was well spent, but April was rather dull and boring. Come to think of it, that was my ONLY problem.
So let's go over the main event first, the turtles. Leonardo is very much like the original. He keeps Raphael barely under control They gave him added attire like the armored bone looking vest. Donatello is probably the farthest from the original, but still very similar. He is portrayed as tall, skinny, and shy. He wears glasses and has a headpiece with binoculars and radar and the such. I really love is lair, which has screens from cameras around the sewers. Michelangelo is still my favorite. He has this rocket skateboard and he cracks jokes and has a couple running gags and such. He has things like a beaded necklace and pins on his chest. Raphael is the focus of this movie. He is the rebel as usual. He constantly chews on a toothpick and sound real tough. He constantly clashes with Leonardo and picks on Michelangelo.
Splinter is real good. They gave him a very Asain sensei look and a good voice actor. He does tons of fighting with his tail and is just all around astounding
Shredder is baws! A lot of people complain about how transformery he looks, but that's what makes him so cool. He can shoot knives or use them as melee weapons. He constantly whips the turtle's butts and just owns on all accounts
Now the disappointments. The first was April. Megan Fox tried her best, but she is no April. She is not a red head and other than her body really has no resemblance. Plus she breaths like this: uh.... huh..... uh...... huh. It gets annoying.
The foot clan used guns and not ninja weapons, very far off from the original. They would've been so much better with ninja weapons.
And the last is Vern. In the original Vern is April's rival, trying to take her stories and be a teachers pet to the boss. In this Vern has a crush on April, as does Mikey, which leads to a love triangle. I don't much like Vern being the love intrest at all.
All in all, they came so close, but they blew it with the humans. I respect Bay for the attempt and hope the sequel is a little better.
That is my review. If you liked please like or comment. If not, sorry for wasting your time.",1413244800,4,2495,4.356223175965665

6329929,4,B00J2T18XS,"This movie was excellent in terms of pure movie quality. There was action, COMEDY, and a good story that is based more around the newer comics than the original movies. Mikey was hilarious & the best part of the movie in my opinion. My main gripe is that is was too April O'neal focused, and not enough hangout time with the turtles... The movie literally could have been called ""April & the 4 ninja turtles"". Leo also took a big back seat in the movie, I think Donnie even had more of a part than him, though it was mostly the Mikey & Raphael show in the small parts it wasn't focused on April. Still a great movie itself, which is why it gets 4 stars; not a great 'Turtles' movie though.

This movie is on par with being just as good as the 1991 TMNT 2, albeit in a different way. The original 1990 is still the best, it developed more depth in whom each of the turtles were. You spent time with them, through their ups & downs, and it provided a great range of emotional journey- Whether chillin in their sewer home eating pizza (a place so cool, i wanted to live their as a kid... whereas the 2014 one looks simply like... a sewer), see them train, or mourn the loss of their master, argue or etc etc.

Regardless, THIS is the funniest of the Turtles movies. I would've bought this preorder if they had a Leonardo bust, or at least the other turtles sold separately. Who wants a lonely Raphael? Raph & Leo are like yin & yang.",1412726400,6,1430,4.2344322344322345

I could ignore most of this movie if the turtles would have at least been kept close to the original concept.  Ninja turtles, fast agile and stealthy we were presented with nearly indestructible hulking monstrosities.  Even worse the look on all their faces gives the appearance of having downs syndrome.  I am not like many of the fans of the classic.  I don't believe the old cartoon show from the early 90s was great nor were the classic live action movies.  I am aware that I loved them because I was a kid.  Instead I think Michael bay should have picked up a comic book or looked at the elements that worked throughout both cartoon series, the movies and even the CG TMNT (such as them behaving as ninja) and scrapped everything that didn't.

For all of the people on Amazon saying this movie sucks and it's supposed to be a kids movie, you truly are not thinking common sense. First off:
Watch the trailer, you should've noticed that there was going to be lots of violence, and action. And some language here and there throughout the movie. It makes me very displeased reading all these hatred comments on such a wonderfuly made movie.

Also most of the jokes were not sexually based. Which is totally funny Bc all of you people think that!

Also April oneal did not steal the entire show! This movie would not have been complete without her! She had great acting, and was a great April o Neal in my opinion.

And look people, if you think that taking your child/children to a pg-13 movie with violence and language in it is okay then you are completely out of your minds. If your child is like 12 or 13 then yes I think It would be fine for them to watch. Any age below, not so much.

You can say well it's a reboot so they did their own story.  Ok but why did they have so many things that you wouldn't know unless you knew the original story.  Their new designs are stupid.  They carry too much on them and are too big and heavy to be ""ninjas"". This will be fine for kids in a stupid jingle your keys in their face kinda way but just go watch the original instead.

New York is under the thumb of a heavily armed gang (clan) called the Foot. Four mutated teenagers (spoiler  they're evolved from turtles) fight back and get caught up in a series of implausible events. Its worse than it sounds.

What did I think?

The new TMNT movie is a cynical attempt to position a franchise for a new younger audience. Sadly it does so at the expense of the existing fanbase by serving up a flimsy, overly childish plot that is too simple for adults and laden with positively cringe worthy dialogue.

It also pays scant regard to scientific reality and apparently Splinter is Japanese for exposition rat. The retconning of their origin simply beggars belief (and this from a TMNT fan more than happy to accept the basic premise of 6-foot-tall ninja turtles existing).

Without the entertaining one liners from Michelangelo this entire movie would be abysmal. Even so, the humor only elevates it to terrible. I only liked three things in this movie: Michelangelo, the fact Shredder is actually badass, and the very last shot of the entire referencing the song So Happy Together which is of course a 60s song released by a band called The Turtles. Sadly this unexpected subtlety is the cleverest part of the entire movie.

Theres an impressive fight scene (singular) but overall this is mindless and occasionally painful. Cowabunga.",1410393600,5,1369,4.9004329004329

6329954,4,B00J2T18XS,"Let me start out by saying that i'm not a die hard fan of the ninja turtles. I don't know all the little specs of them that other fans may know. I just know that I liked the old movies as I used to watch them when I was younger. With that said, I think this movie was a pretty O.K. movie. It wasn't ""great"" but it wasn't ""Bad"" either.. Maybe it was a bad ninja turtle movie, but a good regular action movie.

I do know Michelangelo to be the funny guy, but the comedy he was giving off in the movie was sorta funny/stupid/creepy.. If he was in a human form, I bet he'd look like an ugly smoker that also looks like a crazy stalker... Just a creepy pervy weirdo. I think the story could have been done WAY better.

What I liked from the movie:

- Graphics
- TMNT designs
- Fighting scenes

What I didn't like:

- The humor was poor
- The story was poor
- The villains didn't have a background, they were just in the movie to be in the movie...who knows why...
- Ninja turtles learned ninjutsu from a book found in the sewer (really?)
- The chemical that would cause a desease actually kills it's victims within seconds, so unless this was a zombie movie he woulnd't make any money.
- Megan fox and the camera guy that likes her - Camera guy, why was he in the movie? It doesn't even matter..he was just there to be there and drive them...that's it.
- Megan fox to me looked like she was in-love with every person she spoke to.. She had that ""i want you"" look when some guy would talk to her and it weirded me out.
- When Megan Fox starts getting into her ""emotional"" acts, (screaming) it made me laugh at how bad it was... I didn't feel anything when she screamed...

Her screams where like she was just calling someone.

Megan fox: Michelangelo!!!!!!!
Michelangelo: What!!
Megan fox: I'm just in the movie to look pretty!
Michelangelo: (Insert creepy/stupid joke here).

I'll say this though...If you can do without a good plot and cheesy acting, and just want good action scenes, then this movie is pretty good. I was just watching the movie to watch the movie, so I enjoyed it. I like action movies where it's just a bunch of awesome action.

Ever since Michael Bay announced that he was producing the new TMNT movie, all of us long-time fans shivered in fear and dread over how much he'd ruin this franchise. The feeling was felt even more after seeing the trailer a good month or two before it's August 2014 release. And while the movie IS pretty cliched and terrible, it's not AS bad as we all thought.

THE BAD:

- The turtles look ridiculous. Not exactly bad CGI, but bad artstyle. Why do they have human teeth? What's up with their noses? Same questionable artstyle applies to Transformer-Shredder.

- Megan Fox is STILL a pretty horrible miscast as April O'Neal. She's not *AS* bad as everyone thought due to how the script uses her, but still not a good April. As everyone speculated, actress Olivia Thirlby would've been a FAR better fit, here. (And likely, a better actress too, as Fox still sucks at acting.)

- The movie starts out REAL slow. The entire first half of the movie is ONLY about April O'Neal.

- The turtles are very underdeveloped and two-dimensional. Mikey is the easiest to express for obvious reasons, but everyone else has almost no personality, whatsoever. Leonardo is the ""default leader"" and that's about all you get from him. Raphael is almost non-existent until halfway through the movie (A mini-spoiler here, but all the turtles except him end up kidnapped at one point, and he and April have to team up, giving him the only real lines in the entire movie). Donatello isn't expressed, at all. He's just the ""geeky nerd in high-tech googles"" the whole time. He barely even fights. The only character with any real character development in this whole movie is April O'Neal, and *arguably* Erik Sachs, the main antagonist. Even Vernon gets more lines and screen time than the turtles.

- The plot makes little sense. Half the time, you won't even know what's going on. All you know is Shredder: Bad, Turtles: Good. But throw motivation or motive out the window. Why is Shredder even doing what he's doing other than being the 'bad guy?' How did the Foot Clan rise to power? Are any of these questions even supposed to matter?

- Speaking of plot... this very loosely follows the origins of the original 80's cartoon or comic book. April is one of the main antagonists' (Erik Sacks) daughter, Sacks is some kind of scientist...man, or something, and the Ninja Turtles were her childhood pets they experimented on. They're all loosely connected, but it doesn't even really matter, for the most part.

- Also... the script was apparently re-written so many times, there is major confusion between whether or not Erik Sacks - played by Caucasian actor William Fichtner - was the Shredder or not and just wearing power armor. Apparently, in the final version, Erik Sacks is NOT Shredder (and by association, April is NOT Shredder's daughter) as the two share separate scenes during the climax (Shredder fighting the turtles, Sachs trying to kill April and Vernon) and the real Shredder is never seen unmasked in the movie. But they never really clarify this in the film, so it's often very confusing. Especially since Sacks IS the lead antagonist in this case, thereby reducing the real Shredder to an over-powered sidekick/enforcer.

- Casey Jones isn't in this movie. Not even as a cameo. And Karai (Shredder's daughter and Foot Clan lieutenant) is in the movie, but only as a minor lieutenant character who would otherwise be unimportant if she wasn't female and fit the description of Karai. She is very underutilized.

- Splinter looks horrible and comes off like a cranky jerk in the film. He's also seriously underutilized! He serves no purpose other than to set up the turtles origin, and then surprisingly...

- There's really only one real fight scene in the movie and it's at the end.

THE GOOD-TO-ACCEPTABLE

- Most of the movie is PRETTY damn boring. But the final climax in the last 15 minutes of the film on top of a New York skyscraper manages to wake up the audience. But is it too little, too late?

- Unfortunately, there are already talks of a sequel to be made. However, at least it ought to not be as bad as this one, now that the origin stories are out of the way.

- The story is horrible-to-non-existent, but at least the action scenes are fairly decent.

- Megan Fox sucks, but at least they gave her a bright yellow leather jacket to make her somewhat realistically resemble the attire of the April from the 80's cartoon. Only without the acceptable-only-by-80's-fashion jumpsuit to go with it.

Overall, this movie wasn't as terrible as expected, but it still has tons of holes in the script, character development, and storyline. It just *barely* delivers on the action, but everything else is subpar. The first half of the movie is just ""The April O'Neal Story."" And the second half is ""the bad guy is doing stuff, the turtles have to save New York from him!"" The fight scenes and action scenes are decent, but everything else was lame. I guess the action scenes nearly balance out everything else that's bad in the film, but ""all sizzle and no steak"" isn't enough to save this one. Maybe the sequel will be better, not that this really deserves a sequel/trilogy, to begin with.

6329962,5,B00J2T18XS,"Ok, So let me start by saying I remember the original TMNT. The series and movies. LOVED THEM ALL!! I was turned onto them by my cousin. Mind you the first animated series came out in 1987. The comic I believe was in 1984. The first movie I think came out in 1990 and there were three total. Also I have no problem admitting I am a nerd. So lets break this down.

Other Reviews: I know there are people out there that will say they disliked the movie because of Megan Fox, Michael Bay, the storyline, etc. Point blank i will admit from the original April was just a reporter. I may be too young but i don't recall them ever really giving her a background. Now this movie. The new one does. I LOVE THAT!! I love getting background on her and I love seeing it. I like them taking us back and showing us everything from the beginning. It helps build the story. I know the turtles do not come into the movie until about maybe ten minutes into it. However they are in it almost every second after they make their first real appearance.

People are making it seem like this is the only movie and they should have started with the turtles from start to finish. NO. This movie helps build up for the next one. Because there has to be another one, we didn't get introduced to Casey Jones yet and I'm sure that one will be more on point with the turtles. Even though I'm not complaining.

My Review: I LOVED THIS MOVIE!! Excellent adaptation of the TMNT I loved when I was a kid. I went to see this twice. Once in 2D and once in 3D. Both were amazing. I love the action, I love the introduction to the turtles. This movie was made to get kids reintroduced to the turtles. I am glad it did not rush into things and try and combine everything in one movie. I am glad its not leaving off from the others. Splinter and Shredder were true to form. I actually was glad they showed Splinter and his skills. Everyone had a part and background and you get that from this movie. I can't wait to see what they do with the next one.

The one thing I will admit is I felt like Donnie (Donatello) did not have a lot of parts in this movie. He was there but he didn't have any big moments other than the fight scene down the hill. I will try not to give too much away if anything at all. I know in the original he was your technological genius and the least violent one of the four. I just wished they'd have shown him more with more parts. Of course there is always that one turtle that steals the show and that was ""MC Mikey"" (Michelangelo) and his character was true to form he was always the comedian and they stuck with it. I LOVED HIM! All the turtles were true to character and that is why this movie is perfect for a re-introduction to the TMNT series!

Overall, it will depend on the person. The effects were fantastic. The turtles look amazing, they were rough and real. They didn't look they had been sheltered and pretty all their lives. They looked like they had been through things and lessons learned. Shredder of course is and always will be a brutal villain and he didn't disappoint here. I liked the actors and actresses. Loved the story line. I will admit it was a little basic/generic, but you also have to remember that is all you had with the original TMNT. So i can't fault them on that. I'm sure the next one will probably be basic as well, but it will still be a good movie. Plenty of action, well suited for adults and kids. I took my baby sister and her friends and they LOVED it. They're 15, 16, and 17. I am 27 and went with my best friend and her fiance and my fiance and we LOVED it!! First thing we said was thank goodness it was more like the original than we thought it would be. If you liked the original you will LOVE this. If you just thought it was OK, You should like this. If you never could get into the turtles, well this may just be what you needed.

Sorry its long. Hope this helps. In the end its all about you as a person and what you like. If you don't like Michael Bay or Megan Fox you may not like this. I do not care for Megan Fox, but this was still a good movie!",1409875200,3,4089,4.124215809284818

Changes to the storyline were more plausible, but some of the lines were cheesy.  But the turtles have always been chessey anyway.  The action scenes were good and over the top.  It was like the turtles were in the Matrix.  They also have superhuman strength, which was a nice touch, and the shredder has been given a hell of an upgrade.  He's like, Super, super shredder, almost.  They also made nods to the original 1990 film periodically.",1409875200,,574,4.390476190476191
6329964,3,B00J2T18XS,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles

 Hollywood has treated little kids and die hard fans like myself with yet another Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles full length movie.  I could easily dismiss the latest TMNT flick as beneath the notice of either respectable reviewers or discerning movie goers.  I will not pan yet another movie whose ultimate origins derive from a comic book for two reasons.  This movie will attract audiences who deserve to be served and the movie, while silly, is loads of fun.
 Those familiar with the TMNT story know that four mutated turtles find a father figure and martial arts teacher in Splinter, a mutated rat.  They live in the sewers of NY City and emerge to battle a criminal organization known as the foot clan, also martial artists.  They acquire a human friend, a reporter named April O'Neil who is played by Megan Fox in a role with only a handful of lines but many many stunning closeups of her beautiful features.  That at least is a fair trade off.
 The amphibian quartet have the names of Italian painters, Raphael, Michelangelo, Leonardo and Donatello.  In this version of the tale it seems that April herself named the lads as tiny turtles years ago.
Remember they are teenagers, around 15 or 16 I'd say in terms of human socialization.  In one of the best bits the turtles bash a band of foot clansmen in a very active CGI aided fight in a subway station, a long fight against long odds and as they make their escape after speaking to April for the first time Michelangelo gleefully tells his brothers I totally talked to a girl.  I have a soft spot for stupid but endearing teenage boy stuff.
 Director Jonathan Liebesman gives us a lot of very fast paced but totally unbelievable action.  We can't afford to think too long about the goings on on screen, just eat our popcorn and watch the 9 year old boys around us  enjoy themselves.  Liebesman also directed the 2012 Wrath of the Titans and the 2011 Battle: Los Angeles.  Neither of these films were notable.  TMNT will far out draw any of his previous films.  World wide TMNT has already grossed $94 million on a budget of $125 million, which is why films like this are made in the first place.
 Megan Fox is joined in the cast by Will Arnett, William Fichtner and Whoopi Goldberg in slightly written roles that could have been filled by any competent actor on the planet.  Tony Shalhob and Johnny Knoxville have more difficult and fulfilling tasks as voice talent speaking for the rat Splinter and the hard shelled hero Leonardo.
 Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has been awarded a PG-13 rating for violence of the cartoon kind.  No naked people come on screen and the harshest word is Cowabunga.  This two and a half saw blade film lasts only one hour and 41 minutes.
 This version of TMNT comes in time to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the beginning of the story.

6329968,4,B00J2T18XS,"My childhood was built on FOUR things.  1) Transformers, 2) Jurassic Park, 3) He-Man, and 4) TMNT.  I seriously WOULD NOT be who I am today without watching the crap out of these shows/movies when I was a kid.

That being said, I was very apprehensive about this movie after coming back from seeing TF4 just a few months ago(coming back disappointed, I mean.  Prime riding Grimlock?  no bueno.) , and knowing that Michael Bay had made both, this and the latest TF movies.  Don't get me wrong, I was thrilled that the building blocks of my childhood were getting so much attention now, but I couldn't help but be painfully critical about every.  little.  detail.

I went to see this movie twice with two different friends, and both times was surprised.  There are some holes in the plot and dialogue, and I had the hardest time getting past Meghan Fox and the fact Casey didn't make it into the movie.  Shredder wasn't exactly the most amazing thing either.  I'm pretty sure that he was a decepticon that got confused about what movie he was supposed to be in, and it really bugged me that they made him more of a suit of armor and less of a ninja master.  Am I the only one that was bothered by this???

Needless to say, I let my super-duper-party-pooper-pickiness ruin the first experience for me.  I barely paid any attention to anything else because I was *so* annoyed by these things.

It wasn't until the second time I was dragged to the theater that I really saw the boys, and all of the details that made them actual individuals.  I mean.  Seriously.  The fact that Raph had his mask styled into a du-rag, and his shades.  Mikey and his hoodie and shoes.  Leo, decked out in the tribal quills/beads on his chest.  Donnie and his glasses (my personal fave).  And there is so much more to each one that makes them all incredibly unique.  I cannot stress how much I loved their designs, and I am so freaking happy with Donatello.  Like, he could not have been more perfect.  It was fun watching them interact in a modern live-action, too.

Megan eventually grew on me.  Although I didn't have a problem with her in Transformers (I liked her better than the blonde in TF3), I just couldn't picture her pulling April off, but I think she did okay.

I enjoyed Splinter, too.  He was really interesting, and it was awesome seeing him in action.  That tail, bro.

When I step back and look at it now, it was pretty good for a reboot.  I think that a lot of people went into the theater with an opinion already set in their mind (like I did), and let that cloud over some of the experience for them (like I did).  Another issue is that movies are becoming darker and darker (the new superhero movies, Transformers), and I was really afraid that they'd try to turn this into darker adaptation of something I watched as a kid, and twist it all up.  Thankfully, they didn't.

NOTHING Bay comes out with will EVER be as good as the original trilogy, but I honestly thought this was a good go at it, and I'll be buying it as soon as its out in stores.  To more or less quote some other reviews, It wasn't perfect, but it could have been a lot worse.  Its worth watching.",1409270400,2,3163,4.389655172413793

It had its flaws, mostly in pacing and writing (the movie suffered from late, rushed rewrites, and it showed in the plot). The original premise to use the Eric Sacks character as the Shredder was a little weak, but at least then he would have a face and a story. As it is, the movie's plot basically comes down to ""Fire bad, water good"" and we all root for the Turtles because it's their movie, not Shredder's.

Had the writing stayed true to the series' roots, given Oroku Saki and Hamato Yoshi both relatable human faces, this would have been a very safe movie to make. The decision to root it solely in New York was bold, and may have accidentally given the Turtles more heart than they had in any previous movie. It shows in the little touches like the NYC button on Leo's shoulder strap.

The movie's plot is barely noticeable until halfway through the second act, sometime after it is revealed that April as a child was responsible for saving the turtles and Splinter from certian fiery doom. Before then, it's a veritable mishmash of cinematic ruckuss that sees Will Arnett waste charm and Whoopie Goldberg waste time.

From the comic and the cartoon to the original film and the wonderful toys that came with all of the turtle power one could muster, I was a big fan of the heroes on the half shell.  I managed to get my hands on all four of the original TMNT figures (alas, but no villains, Splinter, or April ONeil) and still have them to this day.  Ive even let my son play with them a few times.  He thinks that they are boring (not nearly as cool as his shiny new versions of my beloved turtles), but appreciates them for what they are.

When it was announced that a new TMNT film was heading for the big screen and Michael Bay (while not directing) would be involved with the project, I was a bit scared.  Bays first foray into my childhood heroes with the Transformers films was terrible.  I enjoyed the first film well enough, but each film after that was wretched.  It was so bad, in fact, that I didn't even bother with the latest one and only own the first film on DVD.  I feared that Bay and company would shred yet another memory from my youth and also set the plate for the early destruction of my sons young memories.

Instead, director Jonathan Liebesman, producer Michael Bay, and writers Josh Appelbaum, Andre Nemec, and Evan Daugherty, have taken a cherished childhood memory given to us all by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman, twisted the origin story a bit, and made a very good film.

Is it as good as Guardians of the Galaxy?  No, and its nowhere near as brilliant as Captain America:  The Winter Soldier, but it is still a very fun film thats loadaed with action, humor, and expected Turtle silliness.

The plot focuses on struggling entertainment/puff piece reporter April ONeil (Megan Fox, who holds her own in the flick) attempting to report something worthwhile instead of her usual exercise craze bits.  She starts to snoop around and uncovers info on the Foot Clan, a crime syndicate that has all of New York in a state of fear.  On one particular investigation, she finds a vigilante fighting the Foot Clan and thwarting one of their jobs.

She attempts to get her story aired, but gets shut down by her boss, Bernadette Thompson (Whoopi Goldberg in a role that could have been forgettable but wasnt), who believes that April might be getting a bit unhinged.  Her only real supporter in this whole ordeal is Vernon Fenwick (Will Arnett) who thinks she should leave the whole thing alone, but has so much of a crush on her that he is willing to help her..but just a bit.

As the story rolls along, April finally runs into the Turtles, and their new backstory is revealed.  From there, its the TMNT gang and April trying to stop the evil Foot Clan and their leader, Shredder.  I won't go into too much more detail, but know that there are other players in the game that are pretty obvious once they are introduced.

The story is full of fun moments.  The turtles are very funny, ranging from the sophomoric antics of Michelangelo (Noel Fisher) to the grumpy resistance of Raphael (Alan Ritchson).  Theres also a lot of action thats usually headed up by Leonardo (Pete Ploszek as the motion capture body and Johnny Knoxville as the voice).  Heck, even the super-intelligent Donatello (Jeremy Howard) gets in a few butt-kicking moments, as well as a chance to show off his tech smarts throughout the film.

Splinter (Danny Woodburn as the motion capture body and Tony Shalhoub as the voice) also gets an excellent action sequence when he faces off against Shredder (Tohoru Masamune).

For the most part, the cast is solid.  As I already stated, Fox holds her own but does reveal a few limitations in her acting abilities in certain scenes.  The always reliable William Fichtner, who portrays Eric Sacks, does an excellent job, but editing and direction seem to stunt his work in a couple of scenes.  Minae Noji, who portrays Karai in the film, gives an excellent but limited performance.  Hopefully her character will be expanded upon in the next film.

The action sequences are nearly flawless.  There were moments in the film where I forgot that the turtles were CGI.  With Bays hand on the production, you know that there are plenty of explosions throughout, and TMNT does not disappoint in that aspect.  The action is quick, fun, and totally unbelievable at times.  HOWEVER, if you go into a film that features four mutated turtles that are teenaged ninjas and have a rat as their master and expect it to be believable, you're an idiot.  Just sit back and watch the action unfurl on the screen and check your mind out for a bit.

When the lights finally came up in the theater after watching Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, my childhood memories were still there and just as fine as ever.  Donatello is still my favorite turtle and Leonardo is still my sons favorite shell shocker.  I don't hate Michael Bay any more than I did prior to this film either.  In short, TMNT is a fun film thats suitable for almost the entire family.  The violence is pretty heavy, but it has a comical twist to it throughout the film.

I recommend checking this one out.  Its a great summer popcorn flick.",1409011200,7,5204,4.5854978354978355

6329977,3,B00J2T18XS,"EDITED AFTER ACQUIRING BLU RAY AND REWATCHING:

Before writing this I'm going to make a little mention of where I come from.  I'm a huge TMNT fan.  It all started with the 80's cartoon, but then I read the current comics, and saw the 2003 cartoon, which I also loved.  Then I got the original B&W comics and loved those even more.  I loved the first and second TMNT live-action films while I tolerated the third to a degree.  I've seen and loved all the good incarnations of the Turtles and loathed and groaned at the bad ones like Next Mutation.  Just so you know that I don't suscribe to that silly theory that a real fan should like every incarnation and I don't believe that theory that those people who don't like this film is because they don't accept change.

I accept change very well, and I think people who dislike this film have very valid reasons to do so.  That being said, I didn't hate it.  I think it has some good moments, but in general it's OK at best, and while it's definitely better than TMNT III, it's still weaker than the other two live-action films and the two animated ones.

THE TMNT:

TMNT started out as a joke.  Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird published a comic book with the intention of parodying 80's comic books, just trying to have a laugh, and never imagined the sensation it was going to be.  The comic shows the origin of the TMNT, four turtles get in contact with a mutagenic substance and transform into humanoid creatures, who are then trained in the art of ninjutsu by an also-mutated rat who learned it by watching his owner Hamato Yoshi.  They live in the sewer and later meet a human lab assistant named April O' Neill, who becomes their contact in the human world.  Eastman and Laird were big Frank Miller fans, and applied his style to the comic book (to the point where, as an easter egg, the Turtles' origin is a direct consequence of Daredevil's).

The book wasn't a huge hit at first, but it gained a cult following.  But then, the story would be adapted into a saturday morning cartoon, and that rocketed the TMNT into fame and they became a huge pop culture symbol.  The cartoon made some changes to the story, like turning April into a reporter, making Splinter actually a transformed Hamato Yoshi rather than his pet and making Shredder a regular villain (he showed up just once in the first issue of the comic, where he was promptly killed).  Incidentally, Eastman and Laird weren't fans of the light tone of the cartoon, and were much more pleased with the darker tone of the subsequent live-action film and the 2003 animated series.

THE 2014 FILM (original review):

This new film makes some changes to the basic formula (none of which are necessary or interesting) and it takes cues from different previous adaptations.  For instance, they kept April's job as a reporter and his cameraman Vernon Fenwick from the cartoon, but they kept Splinter as a rat.  They also kept the personalities of the turtles better established in the cartoon and the film (such as Raphael's attitude problems).  But that's where similarities end.  Instead of being an accident, the Turtles are an experiment, and there's no Hamato Yoshi in existence.  The foot clan are gun-totting terrorists rather than ninjas or robots and... well, it gets a little complicated.

See, the film subscribes to the quite annoying trend of having ridiculous coincidences all the time.  Characters meet and it turns out they had met long before.  An event happens and it just so happens that it's the exact thing the villain needed to happen for his plan to realize.  It reeks of several script rewrites.  There's the obvious ""Turtles were going to be alien"" that was changed, but some are a bit more subtle.  For instance, it's pretty clear that character Eric Sachs was supposed to be The Shredder, but they changed that due to backlash, and they split the character in two.  In consequence, it feels disjointed.

I don't want to spoil things, but there are major problems with the film: the villains' plan is preposterous, the Turtles personalities are exaggerated and the acting is all over the place.  William Fitchner is (like Raul Julia in Street Fighter or Jonathan Pryce in G.I. Joe: Retaliation) aware of how ridiculous the plot is, so he has a lot of fun hamming it up, but Megan Fox is impossibly bland and Will Arnett is shamefully wasted.  The action is mostly generic and the fight scenes border on the soporific.

That being said, the film does have some good moments.  There are very few, but some interactions between the Turtles and between them and Splinter are very well done, interesting and actually funny.  While I question the reasoning on turning the Turtles into hulking brutes, I'm not one of those who hate their visual design.  I actually think it's nice and original, and I like the idea of heroes who are not impossibly attractive.  Also, one of the action scenes is actually very well done and it's exciting.

The real problem with the film is that it doesn't feel much like a TMNT movie.  They could have replaced the turtles with, say, Chip and Dale's Rescue Rangers or the G.I. Joe team and they could have had practically the same plot.  They eliminated some of the things that, in every incarnation, made the TMNT unique and just keeping the same name doesn't make them the same.  So, it's a complicated thing: I think this movie fails as a TMNT movie, but it does fine as an action film.  Yet I can't help to think that people who are not already fans of the Turtles will probably don't like it.  It sounds strange, but you have to see the movie to understand.  All in all, I think it's still worth watching at least once.  But then, depending on your views, you might consider a second watch at some point or you will promptly forget about it.

THE 2014 FILM (after rewatch):

While my opinion on the film is that it's still a stupid movie, it does improve after rewatching it.  Once not constricted by expectations and knowing exactly how the plot is going to unfold, it gets easier to enjoy it for what it is.  To be fair, the personalities of the Turtles are well done, and the film is chock full of easter eggs and references to previous iterations of the franchise.  It's just a shame that they're wasted in a derivative plot with uninteresting villains.  Still, I'd give it half a star more if Amazon allowed it.

THE BLU-RAY:

Unlike most Blu Rays these days, this one takes you straight to the main menu right after the Paramount logo, not forcing you to watch dozens of sometimes unskippable clips and ads.  That's very welcome, since I like to see trailers in theaters, but they annoy me in home video, as they're always for movies I've already seen (for instance, the Guardians of the Galaxy Blu Ray starts with a trailer for The Winter Soldier, a movie that was released in home video months before).

The film's video and audio quality are excellent.  I've noticed how some new films try to exaggerate a grain effect in their home video releases, who knows for what reason, but luckily this doesn't happen here.

The film has quite a few extras, but unfortunately, except for a passing mention of the original comic, none of them talk about previous iterations or adaptations of the franchise.  Still, the ones we have are short but interesting.  The first, ""Digital Reality"" is the one talking about giving life to the Turtles and the overall visual design of the film (sets, action scenes, etc.).  As usual, it gives a lot of info in those little details that you never notice while watching the film but you'd definitely do if they weren't there.

""In Your Face"" The Turtles in 3D"" details about what goes into making the film in 3D and they do a fair show of claiming why they didn't think of it as just a gimmick (this extra can be seen in 3D, even if you got the regular Blu Ray).  ""It Ain't Easy Being Green"" takes a detailed look at the actors portraying the Turtles and all the job they did to become these characters with motion capture.  It's interesting, but it's curious how there's no mention of the voice of Leonardo and Splinter being later replaced with other voice actors.

""Evolutionary Mash-Up"" is curious.  It gives interesting information and compares the evolution of turtles in real life (i.e., the actual animals, not the characters) and the ninjas in real life, myth and culture.  It's inequivocably educational, so I find curious its inclusion here, but it's very neat and it does showcase the fact that the filmmakers actually did their job doing research about these characters.  ""Turtle Rock"" is about the film's musical score, and it's a fairly interesting view on the process, which is a bit odd for a film with such a forgettable score.

""Extended Ending"" is actually a deleted scene that chronollogicaly belongs right before the actual ending, and showcases April working back at Channel 6, which is something the finished film glossed over.  Finally, the last two are the ""'Shell Shocked' Music Video"", which is the rap song from the film's ending, and a ""Making of"" of that video.  The Turtles' adaptations have had a long history with rap music, and this one's no different.  ""Shell Shocked"" is more contemporary rap, though, so it depends on your tastes wheter you'll enjoy it or not (I don't, and I have no shame in admitting I'm partial to ""Ninja Rap"").

One more thing: this Blu Ray comes with ninja masks as a gift.  I understand it's an unexpected free, if cheap, extra (it wasn't there when I made the preorder, it was added later), and maybe I shouldn't complain.  I mean, I think their gimmick is counterproductive.  Instead of four masks, one for each color, you get two masks, which are reversible, with two colors each.  They're OK in their own right, but that reduces the number of simultaneous uses to two instead of four, and not any two (you can't be Donatello and Leonardo at the same time, for instance).  I mean, if your kid wants to play with three friends they need to get extra masks somewhere else.",1408924800,12,10030,4.630447085455574

6329985,1,B00J2T18XS,"Well here's my review of the film...

I've been an avid supporter of the film since the second trailer was released. I was openly judgmental on my opinion on the initial leaked pictures but then after seeing them in motion a couple times, I was starting to get a little more into the concepts. Sure, I still think all the goofy accessories are a bit much like Raphael's sunglasses (which I still don't know how they fit on his head) and Michelangelo's necklace but there were moments in all the various marketing materials that had me beyond excited to finally see this in the theater. All I really wanted out of this film was the same feeling that I get when I think of TMNT in my mind. Great stories, them being actual ""ninjas"" and incredible fights with Shredder. I was hoping that we were going to get some of that at least, even in small doses. I've been the TMNT guy beating my chest for this movie hopefully to get a chance as the underdog against the massively successful GOTG and for the Turtles to reign supreme once again. I won an advanced screening last night and I took my younger brother of 4 years to go see it with me who grew up with me loving the TMNT just as much. We're both avid obsessed fans of the Mirage series and the first 1990 movie but we knew we were going into something that was it's own creation while drawing the tone and vibe of mainly the cartoon. Either way, we just wanted to see this damn thing.

Which leads me to my verdict about the film. Guys, it's not a very good movie.

I originally wanted to do pro and con list but I felt I might as well just give some of my thoughts after seeing the film. The plot is horribly thin and never feels confident in the story it's trying to tell. I read a review that said that this movie is often embarrassed by it's material at times and I'd almost agree with that. It's one thing to change an origin story and add/leave out certain things because you feel it benefits the new story you're trying to tell but in the case of this movie, it doesn't add anything to it.

You can tell that this is the kind of movie that needed a director with a creative vision. Everything feels like a giant compromise to just put something out because the studio was expecting a brand new Ninja Turtle film but all of the backlash from what they were originally WANTING to do caused them to go back and add things that they didn't fully understand why people are fans of those aspects. Aside from being let down from that, my brother and I's two favorite Ninja Turtles are Raph (me) and Mikey (him) and they were probably the worst written of the Turtles. I'll never understand the desire to continue to write Michelangelo as an idiot and obnoxious. I get it he's the goofier one, but Mikey borders on a bumbling moron half the film and it was extremely on the nose. I always gave 2007 TMNT s*** for it's use of horrible fight scenes and while some moments in this new one are nice, I still feel like I'm just watching a video game cut scene with Shredder and the Turtles.

I guess if I have to give this film credit is that it's cinematography at times is very nice and the opening sequence as well as Shredder's first appearance gave me straight goosebumps but this film misses the mark on so many things. I didn't want to dislike this really, but it is what it is. I'll still love the TMNT of course and nothing will take them away from me (hyping for this movie has brought back my TMNT comic love again)....but I almost hope this franchise doesn't continue and we get an eventual re-imagining somewhere down the line. I guess I'm just not as excited to see more stories told in this TMNT universe.

And for the record, I still stand by the fact that the original 1990 film still holds up and is probably one of the best comic book adaptations ever produced. Those who think the franchise was entirely silly probably didn't read any of the Mirage comic books and doesn't understand the true source material. Sure, the cartoons were goofy but that was the KID's cartoon. If you don't like TMNT, that's one thing....but to just assume the franchise as a whole should be overlooked as goofy is assuming you can think the same thing for something like Guardians of the Galaxy. There just needs to be someone with a passion for the source material that can make it work like the original 1990 movie did.",1408665600,17,4364,4.361623616236162

6329988,1,B00J2T18XS,"Where to even begin?  Lets start with what is WRONG with this movie.

Meghan Fox - The girl  can't act. She's got one expression, and it's 'dis interest' throughout the whole movie.  When you LAUGH at her dramatic line readings, something is wrong.

Karai - She is just...there...and gone. forgotten about after the truck crashes.  dead? alive?  who cares?  obviously not the producers.

For an action movie, it really only had ONE action sequence, the Snow chase.  They already had a CGI truck from TRansformers, might as well re use it, right?

So, the Villain wants to get rich. Yet, he already has an army, a huge sky scraper, and a mansion out in the mountains that would put the  Garden State Plaza to shame.  Yeah.

So many re writes, it makes EVERYONE useless.  Fans RIGHTFULLY complained about a white Shredder, but now Sacks is useless.  Shredder is also useless, being just hired muscle.  Karai is REALLY useless, as Sacks now takes her normal roll as 'adoptive relative'.  The Turtles and Splinters only purpouse in this movie is exposition and to get beat up/captured.  None of them have ANY plot devleopment. they tried with Raphael at the end, but it comes LITERALLY out of nowhere.

The Foot Clan with Guns.  Karai with guns. all Japanese history has been erased.  presumably because of some weird rule that chinese audiences do not care to see Japanese people on screen?  What the holy Fudge? If that's you're excuse to be lazy, come up with a better one.

The Toxin supposedly kills the foot guy in 25 seconds. How was he supposed to save the city if everyone is dead?  Karai would never sacrifice one of her own men like that.  2003 Shredder might, but only after multiple failures. not just on a whim.

The turtles designs.  Needless lips, noses and costumes. Do they sleep like that?  how long does it take to get dressed? If an emergency happens, April will have ot wait till their wardrobe goes on first.

Splinter. Holy hell is he ugly.  complete with Borg Queen Hairdoo.

and most importantly, plot and music.  We don't NEED Oscar worthyness in a turtles movie. We need it to be fun, entertaining, and explore the turtle universe like never before with b ig screen money.  This did none of that.  60% of the plot was stolen from The Amazing Spiderman.  IT took THREE Writers to do that? No wonder they hardly have any credits to their name.

The music bored loosely from Thor and the Avengers (same guy) and down right stole from Terminator.  It's just as boringly generic as the movie itself.

Would I have enjoyed this if I was just a 'casual' movie fan?  hard to tell. but as a turtle fan, this is NOT what I expected, wanted, or would ever bother to watch again.  It was my  biggest fear when turtles got sold to an un caring mega corp.  at least the new cartoon gets most things right. this movie didn't even try.",1408665600,52,2843,4.557539682539683

I went into this as a long time turtle fan and was looking forward to this. The action sequences take your breath away, and I love that each turtle has distinct personality traits and also look slightly different, different mannerisms, etc.

I was expecting the story to be horrible from some reviews I read, but I was pleasantly surprised it was pretty on par with past offerings. I do think they have an opportunity to elevate things in the sequel.  The foot clan is terrorizing the city, we have April the nosy reporter (played by Megan Fox, who did a great job) who is trying to make it big by cracking the story. She stumbles on the turtles and without spoiling the plot things kind of snow ball from there. 2014 Shredder is pretty deadly. The action sequences are so well done they are definitely the highlight. The first 10-15 minutes of set up are worth it, it really takes off after that.

It seems to me they WAY over thought his look and it just came off as too much(IMO). Other than that, I couldn't recommend this more!

6330000,4,B00J2T18XS,"There is no need for the backlash that this new reboot has seen. The original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles film is still the best turtles feature, and although this is not the fan boy's dream like we all hoped it might be, it still brings an interesting dynamic and proves that the Turtles are just as fun to watch as ever.

A real fan isn't afraid of change. It happens all the time, especially when a new director wants to show his version of any project. They want to make a mark and tell their own story, and whenever a new remake happens it is almost a guarantee that it will disappoint some fans. It should be known that my previous experience with the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles has been the original three films, and before that the action figures and t.v. series, and most recently TMNT(2007). It's not likely that I have invested more than fifty bucks and two-dozen hours into the franchise itself. Having said that, I assume that places me into a casual audience perspective, however I remember enjoying the original film and it's sequel during the nineteen hundred nineties.

The original was an amazing comic/t.v. series goes to big screen phenomenon, but I'm sure they had plenty of adult critics to listen to in the late 80s. The kids that saw that film are grown people now, and I bet they don't have a bad thing to say about the original turtles movies and show, but that doesn't make them perfect.

Now we have four live action transformer movies, and they just keep cherry picking from everyone's childhood toy box. Imagine my excitement being moderate after hearing about a Michael Bay involvement.. not as director, although I'm sure a direct influence. At least we get a new turtles movie.

So when comparing the history to this new reboot, one needs to be accepting of a little of the same with a lot of the new. It was a lot different in the 80s and 90s. The turtles were going big time and popular as hell to the masses. They were a fresh commodity and the public was eager for more turtles, so how could they grumble about silly kids movies with ninja turtles.. it didn't need to make sense.

I really enjoyed this new movie so the bias is stated. I was prepared for this movie to disappoint like most modern toy films. For some reason the transformers movies don't do much for me because they had always been toys or cartoons previously, and way before my time. It was hard to care about optimus prime. But this is a reboot of a trilogy of movies that I owned and watched over a decade ago on a vcr. I have had a relationship with these brothers before. I was not looking forward to this all things considered. They could have really spun the wrong way with this one. I was ready for a bunch of movie with a lot of no turtles. I was so wrong.

Here are my reasons why this movie deserves its spot in the series and although it does rework some facts that originally generated more fan-lore, this new adaptation stands on it's own.

.SPOILERs.

AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

1. Splinter fights and its awesome.

2. The style and visuals of the turtles couldn't be better, taking into account that they stand on two feet, with six fingers and talk smack, I think a humanoid representation was expected. To put it shortly, they were scientifically modernized. Sort of modeled after the larger action figure versions, with raph sporting a total head covering bandanna. Although they do maintain their own distinct style and sound apart from anything prior.

3. The origin story and the way it ties April to the turtles is charming. April's father works with the lab that produces the mutated turtles. The idea is that the projects leader, Eric Sacks, is trying to make an airborne disease after successfully harnessing the vaccine from four mutated box turtles and selling it to become ""stupid-rich"" after releasing the disease to mold a generic movie bad guy, I'm okay with that, because I want the turtles to have a generic movie bad guy. Anyways, in a frenzy April's dad is murdered because he figures out what Sacks' plan is and tries to burn the lab down. Meanwhile April rushes the 4 turtles and a lab rat outside, dropping them in the sewer and leaving Sack's without a cure. This is something that angers the hardcore fans, because it evaporates the history of both Splinter and Shredder. If you want to be hardcore read the comics and don't watch Michael Bay's movies.

4. Shredder. I liked how they made the shredder. He fights inside of this metal shredder suit. It's well designed, with blades that shoot out to do damage and then magnetically recall. One should remember that Splinter and the brothers are mutated by the ooze into a super rodent/amphibians. The only way he would've been able to fight the turtles and splinter is in this new tranformerish suit. It is within reason that some long time fans will dislike how shredder is a robot samurai, but I like the continuity. And it makes the action more violent without the use of gore.

Fight scenes and effects are awesome. And I don't have issue with how they learned ninjitsu. Splinter finds a book in the sewers and trains himself, and then trains the turtles. I don't have a problem with it because the oozes genetic enhancing qualities are unknown. Meaning if I could jump 20 feet in the air, I bet I would make a damn good ninja.

It is a little disappointing that there wasn't more incentive behind their ninja art form and weapon choice. But we don't need much explanation. It's simple and it pleases a ""what to watch"" bug. The original explanation allowed it to root for an older audience, but never really made me feel more comfortable about their ninja capabilities.  They are ninjas, I accept it.

Another problem I did have with the movie involved the plot design. I like how it explained the reason for mutated turtles, but how many times are they going to give us a comic book movie with the same antagonist strategy to poison the world, and replace the leaders with new order? I realize that this has taken place since human history began, but there has to be something better than that overused movie bad guy motive. You see it in: Spawn(1997), X-Men(2001), The Hulk(2003), X2: X-men united(2003), Batman Begins(2005), Superman Returns (2006), The Amazing Spiderman (2012), The Avengers (2012), etc. All of these have differences, but it feels like the same thing. Some involve DNA others have gods, whatever.

Other than those annoyances, I fully recommend. It was fun and worth owning, but the next one should please the hardcore.",1408147200,64,6553,4.654844290657439

6330002,2,B00J2T18XS,"Before I rant I have to stress that I'm a huge TMNT comics fan & I'm familiar with the many iterations from the comics to the cartoons, & the previous films too. While it's not totally horrid as so many of the reviews would have you believe it's also sadly, not very good either. I'd been eagerly awaiting this movie after Kevin Munroe's 2007  TMNT & 2009's very awesome 2K animated series finale, ""Turtles Forever"". With other movies out on the horizon this past year like Amazing Spider-Man 2, Godzilla, X-Men Days of Future Past, Guardians of the Galaxy, & Transformers 4, this was the one movie that was at the very top of my list of ""must see's"". I wasn't in complete shock being well aware of Platinum Dunes' deficient filmography but still had some faith since it was being directed by Jonathan Liebesman who's also responsible for the very underrated period/action flick, ""Wrath of the Titans"". Seeing the turtles move & fight truly shines here because it show's why they're a force to be reckoned with & certainly with a lot less comedic fight choreography as in the original films. Despite some very brief action scenes & special f/x that are absolutely top notch, it isn't surprising that this movie is more a Megan Fox vehicle than a TMNT movie. Outfit designs aside, the turtles themselves look absolutely jaw droppingly spectacular as does Splinter & while many complaints were targeted at the turtles themselves as appearing too hulking with flared nostrils, this is all just total nonsense. If your a long time fan you can see right away they look like a cross between the artwork of Michael Zulli, & those incredible A.C. Farley paintings from the Mirage Studios era. This movie's flawed because it moves at such a swift pace & then it's over just as fast which would be fine if we got to know the characters a little better but the script obviously didn't leave room for any of that let alone, the reason we want to see this movie in the first place. The turtles. Also not sure why they decided to alter the turtles traditional outfits or why they played up the ""superhero"" aspect by making the turtles superhuman strong & bullet proof. Seeing one of the turtles throw a truck trailer & Raphael smashing out from the side of a van left me scratching my head. What made the TMNT special in the fist place was that they sort of broke the mold of the traditional superhero. They were basically outsiders because of their physical appearance but who also happened to be very skilled fighters. They WERE NOT ever Superman or the X-Men. The lack of character development kills any attempt at the story they're trying to tell here so everyone in the film comes across quite flat & one dimensional. Taking some liberties with the source material is fine if done right & the filmmakers are trying to create something new here but it's still a botched, celluloid mess. As a long time fan I can honestly say that many of the changes they made to the turtles origin's or Shredder & the Foot were completely unnecessary & un-innovative. In fact, this new film's origin story seems heavily influenced by IDW's current comic book series yet the film makers still can't get it quite right. Their lazy bright move? They sever any ties the turtles & splinter originally had with Japan, ninja's, Karai, & Oroku Saki (The Shredder). In the film, technically for me the turtles & Splinter aren't even ninja's just because their ""superhuman/intelligently fast learning mutation"" allows them to photographically memorize all the moves & exercises from an old ninja manual that Splinter found in the sewers. Yes, horrible alterations to their origin. Unforgivable & an insult to the source material. Not everyone but certainly most old school fan's will dislike this movie regardless if they either grew up with them through the comics books or the infamous campy cartoon that followed it. Casual viewers will see it as disposable popcorn entertainment perfect for one viewing. They should really just do all the fans a service & make a brand new movie, do it correctly, & forget this one even exists. I can't even begin to imagine what a train wreck the sequel will be.",1408060800,3,4164,4.735537190082645
6330003,4,B00J2T18XS,"Growing up in the 90s meant amongst the many cartoons you watched, there was also the live action shows like Power Rangers and watching the original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles on repeat. Fast forward 2 decades after the last live action movie and the boys return, in CGI form, and they lose some of their goofiness and sort of inherit a post-Christopher Nolans Batman world. One which has them look a bit more frightening than corny; fight scenes which not only may make you flinch a bit, but show people possibly getting hurt; but still keeping the spirit of the original through showing that, in the end, the turtles are just a bunch of teenagers trying to make their father proud.

Characters & Story
A young reporter named April ONeill (Megan Fox) is trying to transition from doing fluff pieces to serious journalism. Something that she thinks she can do if she breaks a story on this rising gang called the Foot Clan. But between a lack of faith from her cameraman Vernon (Will Arnett), and her boss Bernadette (Whoopi Goldberg) not taking her seriously when she claims to have witnessed not just the Foot Clan stealing from cargo containers, and vigilantes fighting them, she is nearly laughed out of her job.

Unbeknownst to her though, at first, below in the sewers lays a rat named Splinter (Tony Shalhoub) who has spent his life raising 4 turtles as his own, and training himself, and them, to be ninjas. One being the tech ninja Donatello (Jeremy Howard); the silly, and very comical, Michelangelo (Noel Fisher); The would be leader of the group Raphael (Alan Ritchson); and his 2nd in command Leonardo (Johnny Knoxville). Together, these brothers have to work together as Shredder (Tohoru Masamune) tries to rise back in prominence and take over New York. But with Raphael talking about going solo, partly due to his bickering with Leonardo, will the brothers stay one cohesive unit long enough to protect and save the city?

Praise
One of the good things about living in a post-Christopher Nolan Batman world is that it makes it so it feels like all your childhood favorites are growing up with you. For with Nickelodeon being the type of company which somehow balances making childrens entertainment, and yet not forgetting about teen and adult viewers, it makes this film quite entertaining. For example, unlike in the original trilogy I got an emotional response from this. For there is really a strong focus on family bonds and how the turtles rely on each other, and Splinter, and the dynamic makes some of their dire challenges something which can get you teary eyed.
Then when it to the action, this film blew me away a bit. For unlike Guardians of the Galaxy, the fighting didn't look WWE style where everything was planned and choreographed to the T. Be it because of the use of CGI or perhaps better stunt men/ motion-capture performers? I don't know. Either way, the scenes, especially when Shredder was fighting, really brought the idea that these turtles aren't some god-like force which undoubtedly were going to defeat Shredder. For moments I was actually able to forget I know the ultimate result as Shredder really took it to the team.

Leaving one last thing to praise: the jokes. Now, I only laughed 12 times but I was pretty much smiling throughout because between Michelangelo and Will Arnett to a point, this film is very comical. Most of the laughs though come from Michelangelo trying to woo April, as well as the general way people act around April because she is attractive. Reminding me, despite Megan Fox perhaps not being known as the most talented actresses out there, she does make for a decent protagonist and even feels more developed than most woman get to be in action movies. She won't make you tear up or anything like that, but she does show she is worth her salary in my opinion.

Criticism
Leading us to talk about the minor issues, for me, when it comes to the movie. Such as Splinter, for some reason, he seems to be the only one who speaks Japanese out of his whole crew, which I thought was strange. Then comes the issue of Shredders lack of ambition which reminded me of of Dr. Evil, from Austin Powers. You see, Shredders goal in the film is to take over New York with this toxin, and considering how the toxin was to be airborne and Shredder had the antidote, his ambition of taking over New York City just seemed so minuscule to me.

Overall: Worth Seeing
Admittedly, nostalgia is what tips this from being TV Viewing and being labelled Worth Seeing. For while the criticism is mostly just nit-picking, the turtles definitely do feel inspired by the times, and while the inspiration does well for the movie, I do feel like it sort of makes it so it loses its ability to be for kids in the process. Though with kids nowadays being different from when I was growing up, maybe this does fit for my current age range, and this up and coming generation. Either way, with good laughs, superb action, and a nice heartfelt story about the importance of family, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles returns to the big screen and definitely feels like it warrants a sequel.",1408060800,7,5119,4.707589285714286

6330005,5,B00J2T18XS,"I actually found some enjoyment in this movie. The action scenes, particularly a snow chase scene, we're really well shot, directed, acted, and choreographed. The turtles' personal characteristics shine in this new version, as every one of the 4 members shine and are memorable because they all had different personalities, and all of them were really likeable. Shredder was a menacing villain in this movie, and Splinter was actually very convincing as the turtles' father figure and master.

Megan Fox as April O'Neil delivered a performance that I'll right now say, is the best one she ever delivered. She really delivered emotion when it was needed, and was a very likeable actrees. His cameraman delivered some of the humorous moments if the film, even if he wasn't the funniest character in the film (that honor goes for the turtles, as they delivered a whole bunch of LOL moments).

All in all, I can say I really enjoyed this latest outing in the TMNT franchise. It had solid acting, great action set pieces and visual effects, a mesmerizing villain, and even a heart. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles comes recommended.",1407974400,6,1124,4.973404255319149

6330011,4,B00J2T18XS,"""My girlfriend Is totally the hogoshah!"" Yeah, Mikey, I know Megan Fox is in it, but put that aside for a moment. I remember how appalled Turtle fans were at the reinvention of the black & white series to make a kid friendly TV version of the Mirage comic. Then the 1990 Film that put New Line on the map which was closer to the original without alienating youngsters who knew the color-coded tv version and their Archie Comic tie-ins (although they were in for a rude awaking when our first bit of Turtle dialog is Raphael swearing... ""Damn."") 2007's TMNT was the last theatrical adaption of Eastman and Laird's  comic-book series (an homage to Frank Miller's Ronin that grew into a toy and tv empire). While the 2007 seem to build on the film continuity a bit with older versions of the characters, here we have a full reboot unrelated to the NICK series, even linking April O'Neil to the Ninja turtle origins. It may be another telltale sign of middle-age that I was ready to hate the first live-action theatrical release since 93, but I really enjoyed it. Sure there was a fart joke 20 minutes in, but the heroes on motion capture half-shells really came to life in this one, finally free from the confines of Jim Henson's creature shop & the emoting limitations of Japanese stunt men. The process here has more heart (and texture come to that) than the 2012 CGI animation currently on tv. But as cute as the Nickelodeon turtles are, I like these older Lost Boy/ urban-tribal looking Mutant Teens, especially Donny's specs and sewer-made gadget-wear. The Director Jonathan Liebesman and producer Michael Bay (the real reason I was quick to be cautious) have not forgotten the dynamic of the live-action brothers and each of their unique character quirks. Although fans had to make a pre-release fuss to keep this 30th anniversary film from becoming simply ""NINJA TURTLES"" we get a darker look to the ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" bringing more nods to the early comics and at least one of the 3 animated incarnations of TMNT (like Vernon Fenwick, a turtle-mobile, shredders ""adopted"" daughter Karai ). But, there are more departures from TMNT canon than ever, like the origins. Not the fact that the mutagen (and in effect turtles themselves) is extraterrestrial that actually is in the original comics although it isn't revealed until later in the Mirage Comic universe. What is new to the Turtleverse besides origin ties to young April, is the shocking reveal that Splinter is actually a DIY ninja! Seriously though, the matrix-upped fight sequences are cool but sometimes over busy, especially Shredder's impossible battle-suit robo-blade overkill (which may make more sense if he is revealed an Utrom as in his 2003 origin, hinted at here in Sack's mural). The voice talent is solid, Tony Shalhoub is serviceable as Splinter (although why not have Kevin Clash back as Splinter), even Johnny Knoxville pulls his weight at Leonardo. The story is equally ok, April meets the boys while trying to crack the Foot's crime wave, uncovering a greater plot that the boys must save NYC from.

Sadly there's no post credit shawarma scene here (although pay attention just as they begin) but Dr. Sack's mutagen research refs T.C.R.I (Techno Cosmic Research Institute) and Shedder's final screen moments hint at Utroms and a possible comic related arc in a sequel (which I've heard has been Green-lit already)",1407974400,3,3405,4.889273356401384

When the cartoons started ruining the turtles, I thought we would see no more of the shelled heroes and their annoying beach bum dialogue.  But Paramount and Nickelodeon had one more crucial dump to take on the franchise.  This movie.

Poor Megan Fox.  First Transformers, now TMNT.  Two franchises ruined by fecal movies.

Beloved by many children and adults the world over, the TMNT have been put to rest.  The movie demonstrates how glaringly DUMB these characters are.  If perhaps they never spoke, the movie might have been a two star.  But this film is corn-to-the-max, barely suitable for children.  Annoying personalities abound here.

6330014,4,B00J2T18XS,"I grew up a huge Ninja Turtles fan (like many children of the late 70's and 80's) and now that I have young children, I've been able to relive my childhood with the loveable turtles. My son (age 4) LOVES the Ninja Turtles and my oldest daughter (9) appreciates them as well (though she'd rather watch 100 episodes of Monster High hehe). My son and I first saw Michael Bay sneak peeks into the latest iteration of the Ninja Turtles way back in fall of last year (maybe even earlier). Once the official trailer came out, we were both pretty excited to see what they did with it.

I didn't walk into the theater expecting an Academy Award nomination for Best Picture. But if you were like me, looking for a fun, fast-paced and nostalgic experience with your favorite heroes in a half shell, then you might be satisfied. Regardless of if you like the new character designs or not (which I found them to be super cool, but that's just me), you would be hard-pressed not to find at least something enjoyable with this movie.

I took my kids to see it on the Ultra Screen the day after it was released and we all left with big smiles. The movie went straight into the action and the story was well paced. There were several lines in the movie that paid homage to the original series and movies which invoked a chuckle from those that recognized them, along with several funny moments with Michelangelo (quite the comedian) which kept the movie lighthearted and not too dark and serious.

Liebesman did a pretty good job telling the story in my opinion. He didn't spend too much time explaining the backstory, expecting his viewers to be completely unaware of the Ninja Turtles storyline, but I felt he did enough to show how they got to where they are today in an interesting way. The special effects were exceptional. The sound was loud and the voice acting was pretty good. Megan Fox as April O'Neil might not have been the greatest fit, but she was nice to look at (if I'm being honest here).

Is it the best Ninja Turtles adaptation? That depends on your affinity towards the original flicks. If you are a diehard Ninja Turtles fan who is stuck on your romanticized image of what the Ninja Turtles should be, you're likely not going to like the direction Liebesman went. But if you are willing to embrace a new take on the classic and enjoy an occasional silly, loud, exciting action flick that doesn't take itself too seriously, you will probably enjoy this. Take it for what it is and don't go into it with high expectations and you might be pleasantly surprised the way I was.

Oh, and for the product itself; this box set looks pretty awesome so I will absolutely be preordering this. Once it arrives, I will update the review to reflect the actual product.",1407888000,15,2758,4.519038076152305

I even earned myself a free ticket getting those cans. I don't really know if it was just me or not, but I was not very pleased with this movie. Don't get me wrong, it isn't really bad, film wise. The plot is executed with no problems, the script isn't horrible, and for the most part, the cast is full of some pretty good actors. All that comes into play in the downfall of this movie. This isn't a Ninja Turtle movie, this is another Michael Bay film. For about the first 45 minutes the turtles aren't really even on screen that often. Megan Fox steals the show from the turtles completely. Megan's character is the main focus of the movie and her scenes just drag on until you're sitting there awaiting the comic relief of the turtles. That brings me to another fault in this movie. It is being marketed as a children's movie, which it certainly is not. The jokes are mainly sexual and most are coming from Mikey, and directed towards Megan.

Yes, you heard me right: my daughter. Which is not to say that my son (the younger one) didn't want to see it, but it was much more passive with him. You know, sure, he'd like to see it but, if he didn't get to, it wasn't gonna kill him. Not just did my daughter have to see it, but she had to see it ON OPENING DAY! OR ELSE!

So we went to see it on opening day. It wasn't the first showing, but I'm here writing this, so it must have been close enough to it to keep me alive. For now.

Added to all of that with my daughter, I like the Turtles. The original comic series was pretty brilliant, and the first movie (1990) was so well done it sealed my fate as a fan. That said, I never liked the original animated series. I was more than a few years too old for that when it came out, and ""silly"" was probably the best description I ever had for it. Needless to say, the Turtles have undergone many changes and interpretations over the years, so I'm not going to try to compare this to any previous incarnations. As much as that's possible, at any rate.

There will be spoilers:

As with any Michael Bay movie, the story is the movie's weakest link. If you've seen The Amazing Spider-Man, you might recognize the plot device of releasing a pathogen from a tower on the top of a prominent building in New York City which accompanies a rooftop battle to stop said release of said pathogen. Add to that the rather overused (at this point) plot of having a secret stash of the antidote to the pathogen on hand to charge the unsuspecting populace for and become insanely wealthy and you'll see the lack of thought that went into the story. Even the twist, that the antidote is in the blood of the Turtles and they must be drained to retrieve it, has been done more times than I can count. Or remember.

But, hey, I suppose considering their target audience... actually, I'm not sure what their target audience is since I'm sure they're trying to get the nostalgia audience along with the kids... Oh, well, for a movie more geared toward kids, I'm sure the plot is fine. Mostly, what the movie needs is good, snappy dialogue, and it has that. My daughter loved Michelangelo because he was so funny. Honestly, there were a lot of laughs in the movie, which ought to be the case for a Turtle picture.

And, as in any Bay movie, the action was spectacular.

There's nothing to complain about with the acting, either. Megan Fox was good as April O'Neil, maybe better than good. She really was the part. Will Arnett was great but, then, it's hard not to enjoy Arnett. The voice actors did a great job, especially Tony Shalhoub whom I didn't even recognize during the movie. Possibly the only issue with the acting wasn't actually an acting issue but a casting one: As soon as I saw William Fichtner, I knew he was the bad guy because, well, that's kind of what he does. It's not fun to know who the villain is because of typecasting.

Speaking of the villain, the other villain, Shredder, although he does have the huge rooftop battle with the Turtles, is hardly the bad guy in the movie. He's just this sort of background character who seems to be controlling things, but, other than the fight, he's not really there. That was disappointing. He, as a character, was hardly menacing because of that. The only thing that made him scary was the huge cybernetic armor suit that he had. I mean, really, anyone can have a suit.

The other main issue goes back to the story, and that's having the Turtles start out as April's childhood pets. It's like ever since Tim Burton did that whole ""I made you"" thing in Batman, everyone has to have everything circle back around and be all connected and stuff. I suppose it's supposed to make it cooler but, really, it doesn't do anything for me other than cause my eyes to roll. Seriously, it's not even voluntary.

Still, as long as you buy into the plausibility of the Turtles, there's nothing really to break the suspension of disbelief. It never goes to ""Seriously!? You expect me to buy that?!"" Even the big rig scene stayed within the bounds of Ninja Turtles.

Basically, it's a fun movie... if you like the Turtles. Or if you're a kid who is going to end up liking the Turtles after seeing the movie. If you're not a Turtle fan, this one's probably not for you.",1407715200,3,4471,4.361778846153846
6330019,3,B00J2T18XS,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"" (USA, 2014)

1. This is one of those movies that doesnt suck, but isn't awesome, either. Its fun, but thats about it.

2. Its the fifth movie about the turtles, based on the classic comic series. This is a pretty big reboot. Its directed by Jonathan Liebesman, who directed ""Battle: Los Angeles"" and ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Beginning"".

3. The movie had to go through several script changes. It was originally darker and more gritty, like the original comic series. But since Nickelodeon was helping to make it, they had to change the script to make it more family-friendly.

4. The plot is generic and tired; an evil businessman wants to poison a city by releasing a chemical into the air. The four turtles try to stop it (yeah, youve seen this before, only it was Spider-Man that tried to stop it).  Dont try too hard to make sense of the story - its kind of just thrown together.

5.  Megan Fox plays April ONeil. In this version,  April is a TV reporter. For some reason, Casey Jones is not in this movie. Oh, and Johnny Knoxville is the voice of Leonardo.

6. The turtles themselves are masterpieces of computer generated characters. The special effects in the movie are pretty amazing. And its totally worth watching in 3D.

7. Its got a lot of humor - some of it is kinda dumb, some of it is pretty funny. And it has some great action sequences, although they are confusing to watch.

8.  It was produced by Michael Bay. It looks and feels like a Michael Bay film. The last 30 minutes is basically ""Transformers"" with turtles instead of robots.

9. Hardcore fans of the real, original Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles will probably think this movie cuts out all the zany grit that made them so awesome. But if you don't really know anything about the turtles, youll have a good time. And then youll go on with your life and probably forget you saw it.",1407715200,12,1923,4.539130434782609
6330020,3,B00J2T18XS,"It has been a little more than twenty-years since the `muppetish' ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III"" and I'd have to admit that with the popularity and quality of the Nickelodeon cartoon, that a reboot was warranted. The pre-criticism has been rampant and nowadays that's fairly typical. Everybody has access to computers and phones and can voice their opinions like never before. More importantly, everybody can make a better movie than those that do.

There is plenty to criticize about ""TMNT 2014"", but it may or may not have been a better movie than expected. Megan Fox was just fine as April O'Neill, the Turtles did have unique personalities and the fact that the turtles had noses wasn't a big deal in the least. On the other hand, although Michael Bay didn't direct the film (Johnathan Liebsman did), the markings of Producer Bay were all over the film, and that's not a good thing.

As with 1998's Michael Bay brain-hurter ""Armageddon"", many of the sequences are edited into hundreds of three-second shots that are tough to watch. The opening animated sequence was such an assault on the senses that I had to look away from the screen during it. It was such a flurry of shots that I was so busy concentrating on the bombardment that I have zero idea what was even said during it. Much of the film is shot with a handy-cam style and in close, making some of the darker scenes pointless in 3D and some of the scenes actually really cool. It was a mixed bag.

Another trademark of Michael Bay reared its ugly head with one ridiculous scene that didn't have to be so ridiculous, and I'm not even talking about the tower falling scene at the end of the film. A scene of cars and trucks crashing down a snowy hill was okay until it went on and on forever and just kept tumbling and tumbling further into overdone land. Not to mention, two human characters somehow survived the idiocy.

I could go on and on with the criticisms; some of the scenes were staged ridiculously and Will Arnett's character, Vernon Fenwick, was way too heroic toward the end of the movie, which was a total over-step. Yet, notice I said nothing about Megan Fox and the Turtles were, well, the turtles. That being said, the movie was fun. You can sit there all day and criticize and knit-pick (and you certainly can) or you can forget your critical eye and have fun. If you do that, Turtles is good enough.",1407715200,7,2384,4.576112412177986

Of course I've seen all the movies and I still have my SNES Turtles in Time game, but I've never watched the 80's cartoons, or read the comics. I understand they slightly changed the mythology, but I really enjoyed this movie, probably better than I was expecting. They tried to make it funny and hip by adding pop culture references and having Michelangelo be in love with April O'Neil. Shredder's suit has been extremely updated by adding knives and swords that retract back after he throws them. Other than Will Arnett's character and Whoopi Goldberg's character mocking the idea, the movie takes itself pretty seriously with the idea of ninja turtles fighting and protecting New York from Shredder and the Foot Clan. It has great action, has a lightly dark tone, but makes up for it with comic relief and one-liners by the turtles.

6330028,5,B00J2T18XS,"I grew up with the original TMNT when I was a kid.  I watched all the cartoons, read some of the comics, and saw all three of the movies.  So when I heard that there was going to be a new live action movie, I just knew I had to see it!

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

First of all, Megan Fox just isn't a very good actress.  She really is just eye candy that looks good next to a male lead actor.  However this movie is meant for little kids so I guess I shouldn't be expecting Audrey Hepburn levels of acting from this actress.

The turtles themselves looked awesome!  They didn't look like a guy in a rubber suit like they did in the original films, but they had a new and improved look.  They were taller, more muscled and they looked more lethal then before.  Their weapons looked like actual weapons rather than just stage props.  The Shredder looked totally badass!  Plus his weaponry was really cool and he looked deadly!

I actually liked the new take on the origin story!  Instead of just coming across the Ooze, they were injected with a few chemicals that made them what they are today.  And April was the daughter of the scientist who was doing the experiments and when he destroyed the lab to try and save the world, she saved the turtles and Splinter and gave them freedom.

I'll admit these aren't the kinda turtles that are always shouting, ""Radical!"" or ""Outrageous!"" or ""Righteous!""  Like they did when I was a kid, but I liked the new take on them.  (However we do get one good ""Cowabunga!"") They all had their original quirks, Leo was a kinda stiff leader, Mikey was a party/surfer guy, Donnie was a tech wizard and kinda a nerd, and Raph was an angry tough guy.  (Yes he was cool but rude!) ;-)

We also had several little nods to the original movies that I loved!  Such as ""TGRI"" on the canister of Ooze.  We had Vernon as April's sidekick.  And yes I was looking for Irma as well but she never showed up.  The Ooze was referred to several times as ""Mutagen,"" like it was in the cartoon.  And yes, we had PIZZA!!!

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

This movie was just awesome!  I loved the imagery, the fights were awesome, the voice acting was great, and the plot was very good!  The evil plan that the Shredder cooked up was something that he would have done in the original cartoon and that made me love it that much more!

If you loved the original cartoon and the movies, then you will certainly enjoy this new take on a classic franchise!

6330029,5,B00J2T18XS,"At first, i feared this was going to be a disappointment then later trailers show the goods. Give it a chance before hating. Now I'm writing this despite I'm tired of hearing people complain about it that, its not as good as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles canon of years past. So listen up, negative people think this film is a bomb, you must not know your Turtles history which some of you guys never stop to take a moment to reflect how our heroes adapt in 2014 society post 9/11 world and compare this new film to the original 1990s films and cartoon series and the original comics created by Eastman and Laird but speaking of Kevin Eastman, he consults over the film and the filmmakers on making sure to keep it faithfully not only to the original comics, but cartoons mostly 80s and 90s original and the past films and have it make sense for the now.

The haters say they won't see this anytime soon have never really paid attention to the canon well enough and/or no childhood which they never had or still in their parents' basement need to get a clue, stop judging the book by its cover. Just see the new film before you start to hate on it not before not seeing it, ITS THE TRUTH ABOUT SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ABOUT KNOWING THEIR TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES MYTHOLOGY, I know my Turtles history from the good ideas to the bad ideas they came out over the years.

One last thing Shredder is Asian, all this time not no whitewashing crap, which this movie is true to the source while taking liberties that don't ruin into a bomb at all, don't know what you people are drinking so give it a chance! Kids, long-time fans go see it!

Update: I saw the film and turns out it's far from a terrible film nor a great film but a solid re-imaging and better than expected film Turtles film for the 21th Century post-9/11 world and post-Nolan Dark Knight. It is a darker film than you would expect without being too over the top with a series of Easter eggs in the film which people should catch and stay tuned during the credits for a bonus scene that sets up the world of where these films will go now. Just turn off your brain and let your childhood be relived all over again! Despite the pg-13 rating, it's intense but think of the original film today on its level of violence and put this one on a comparison and you should see.",1407628800,4,2336,4.328767123287672
6330030,4,B00J2T18XS,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 2014 is an enjoyable fun summer movie with great action and great effects. This is pretty much a Michael Bay action movie with kid-friendly humor. The action choreography is done by real life martial  artists, and are fluid and well shot. The 4 turtles and Shredder are well done with there effects, except for Splinter who needed more polish. Transformer's Megan Fox is pretty much well... Megan Fox. But the star of the movie is the turtles who well done and well realize.",1407542400,4,503,4.781609195402299
6330031,5,B00J2T18XS,"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles is the perfect example of a movie that isn't made for me. Its main demographic is children from the age of 5 to 10 years-old, and for that group, its probably the best thing theyve seen all year. But unlike them, I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary. It looked to be a harmless, cheesy, and occasionally funny action-flick that wouldnt be a total bust. And as suspected, thats exactly what it was. Its one of those films that you won't remember 24 hours after youve seen it, but in this case that doesnt matter. For what it is and what its meant to do, its not half-bad (at least in a campy sort-of way).

A remake of the classic story, it follows a lovable group of mutated turtles who are forced to face-off with Shredder, an evil gang leader taking over New York City. And for the most part, its nothing special. Its your standard Michael Bay-type action with jokes sprinkled in here and there, the funniest coming from Michaelangelo. But the reason Im giving it a pass is because the target viewers don't really care about some of its flaws, like the acting from Megan Fox or the ridiculous writing.

Theyre simply hoping to laugh a bit and see their favorite turtles fly around and kick some butt, and in my opinion, it achieves that. As I was watching, I looked around and only saw pure joy on the kids faces, some of them even cheering when the turtles were winning. And though I may not think the film is great by my standards, I could tell they were loving it. So if you have kids, I encourage you to give this a shot. It may not be your cup of tea, but it most certainly will be theirs.",1407542400,4,1630,4.376237623762377

6330033,4,B00J2T18XS,"Having grown up with the Turtles since the beginning, I went into the theater with the hopes of seeing a fun movie that captured the spirit of the Turtles, along with their martial arts antics, knowing they may have dangerous weapons, but since it's a kid's themed concept, rarely ever use them to dismember or kill their enemies. Also with the hope of seeing Shredder and Splinter play big roles. I wasn't worried how April O'Neil was portrayed too much, since she's not the character I'm paying a ticket to see.
I was not disappointed. After hints of the Turtles leaving their mark, we finally get to seeing the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles about 1/4th into the movie. After establishing their origin from a laboratory study of a special anti virus mutagen, the Foot Clan and Shredder, now equipped in a super, high tech Armored Uniform, attack the Turtles to harvest their blood for a sinister plan to infect NY City, and then hold them hostage with the possession of the only cure.
Raphael plays a major part here, underplaying the significance of Leo, who is normally the boss in charge in the various cartoon series. Donatello has lots of equipment knowledge, but we don't see any major devices highlighted that turn the tables on the enemy other than their standard equipment, and Mikey's role here lives up the pizza loving, skate boarding, Cowabunga style he's famous for. Splinter is a tough master here, and highly skilled with his tail as a whip, which was a nice trick.
So while your exact expectations may not be fulfilled, remember that the Turtles go into every fight with plenty of attitude and the spirit of having fun, which this movie captures really well. The story plays out clearly and the action scenes, especially after the halfway mark, are a blast of high energy, great martial arts, and cool special effects. Action scenes included a fight in the sewers, a fight of Raphael vs Shredder, Splinter vs Shredder, the turtles vs the Foot Clan, the turtles in a very action packed race down a snow mountain, and a great ending fight of Shredder vs the Turtles.
The 3D was an outstanding compliment to the film too, and matches the 3D power of movies like Avatar for comparison's sake. 5/5 for the 3D for certain. Lots of stuff flying at you too.

The director and film crew got a lot of things right here, even if many diehard fans point out all of the things that didn't match the original history of the turtles and lost out on the fun to be had here because of it.",1407542400,5,2489,4.618510158013544
6330034,5,B00J2T18XS,"This movie was everything that I wanted.  Was it perfect? Not quite.  But did it deliver? In spades.

First, the producer has been extremely keen to meet longtime fans' expectations.  When rumors began to be heard that the Turtles would be aliens, they changed it and assured us that this would not be the case. When the fans complained that The Shredder was being whitewashed, they changed the script and filmed new scenes, giving us a Japanese Shredder.

I went to see this movie with my wife, who was pretty skeptical about the whole concept of TMNT but was watching it to humor me.  At the end of the movie, she readily admitted that she had definitely enjoyed the movie and better understood my love for the Turtles. And that's what this move had to do, above all.  Please old fans and create new fans.  It did both.

Leo, Raph, Don, and Mikey were great; Splinter was great; April was great; Shredder was menacing.  The fights were amazing, the humor was hilarious, and the message of fathers and family resonated.  My only complaints of the movie? 1)  Too short  2)  A little too evident that the original storyline (William Fichtner as The Shredder) had been rewritten late in production.

I will definitely watch this movie once or even twice more in theaters, and I am buying this on DVD the day it releases.  All I ask is that I get at least two, preferably three or four, sequels in return.

Oh, and don't let the trailers fool you--Megan Fox was amazing in this movie.  She is convincing in her emotions and her interactions, and is genuinely sweet as a big sister or mother figure to the Turtles.  Haters need to shut up and stop verbally abusing this woman.  It's unbelievable how cruel some of them have been.",1407542400,17,1725,4.55700325732899
6330035,1,B00J2T18XS,"This film has without a doubt definitely split the fanbase, you either like it or you hate it. I'm going to try and give my best reasons as to why this film was just not very good, if you don't agree with them i understand, but just try to take some of my points into consideration instead of ridiculing me, calling me a non-fan, calling me a hater, or any other childish response.

1. To start off, the plot is incredibly generic and basically rips off part of the plot of The Amazing Spider-man. The plot also holds very little motive for both the heroes and villains actions(more on that further down, see #3 and #4).
 The foot clan just inhabits New York city's underground, it's never really explained why they and Shredder are even there, but every now and then they steal stuff for generic evil mega rich business man Eric Sacks, who is secretly a member of their clan. The second they find out that there are these mutated turtles still alive from a genetic experiment thought lost in a lab fire a decade or so ago with mutagen in their blood, they ditch whatever they were doing to catch these creatures.
Throw out decades of established story elements and character traits-- add in an hour of generic action movie special effects and lots of destruction-- leave an opening for a potentially even more generic sequel-- roll credits---That's the plot of Jonathan Liebesman TMNT in a nutshell.

2. During the pre-production there were reports that they were having major script issues, and it shows. The films story is such a huge mess that you could just tell it had been through quite a few rewrites. It's obvious that Eric Sacks was originally ment to be shredder, but a last minute rewrite changed that, and a mysterious Japanese guy named ""Shredder"" became Shredder, but the script writers still left in a few of the building blocks that indicated to Eric Sacks becoming Shredder.  The dialogue is also horrendously bad at times; hears a good example: ""We will drain every last ounce of their blood, even if it kills them.""---if you don't see a problem with that line then there is no helping you.

3. I went into this film with a positive attitude thinking that if they could get the characters and the turtles right, stay true to Kevin Eastman's and Peter Laird's vision, that i would be ok with this movie, no mater how much mindless nothingness it contained, but for me they didn't. This is the part of my review where some of you will likely have some opinions that differ from mine, keep in mind that this is just my personal take on the characters and how i feel they compare to previous incarnations, so i don't expect others to agree.
 Hear are what I feel are some of the biggest character problems: Tony Shalhoub as the voice of Splinter comes off relatively weak and just does not do the character justice, also Splinter's CGI design is downright terrible, and i don't much care for the turtles looks either, way too big. Whats the point of being ninjas if you're the size of a small vehicle and basically bullet proof? They're essentially tanks with ninja weapons.
 Then there's Shredder, who is literally the most underdeveloped villain ever seen in a movie. You don't hear anything about Hamato Yoshi, or Oroku Saki, they essentially don't exist; Shredder just...IS, no real backstory, he just exists to kill the turtles with his very convenient battle suit. It's like the movies Producer(Michael Bay) plucked a generic Decepticon right out of one of his pitiful Transformer movies, called it Shredder, and just has him beat-up the turtles for a little while, no motive at all.
 The voice actors chosen for the turtles weren't all that bad, but Johnny Knoxville's voice as Leonardo didn't work, it just sounded like i was listening to Johnny Knoxville the whole time.
 Donatello was alright, i thought the whole tech geek approach to his character was interesting, and he could have probably really shined if only they would have given his personality a little more growth, given him more creative things to do with all that stuff he carries; think along the lines of ""Data"" from ""The Goonies"".
 Then there's Raphael and Leonardo who's personality's are somewhat weak, as there isn't enough time given to the development of their characters, and what development there is at times feels forced, example: That whole emotional scene near the end with Raphael spilling his emotions to the other turtles as they tumbled to the ground, tho it was a somewhat touching scene, there was virtually no buildup to that moment at all. I believe only in one scene earlier in the film did Raphael make a quick comment(that happened so fast that if you weren't paying close attention you'd likely have missed it) about wanting to leave the other turtles and strike out on his own. So that whole spat between Raphael/Leonardo and the subsequent scene with Raphael towards the end really felt like it was not given the time to properly develop.
 Michelangelo is really the only turtle that is somewhat entertaining, but his jokes/one-liners are more cheesy than a fresh baked Pizza, and some have to do with his very unnatural and just plain weird attraction towards April.

4. Another change that should have the fans annoyed, and annoyed they should be, has to do with how the turtles learned Ninjutsu/their origin. Simply put, Splinter as a mutated rat in the sewers finds a Ninjutsu instructional book, and he learns from that and teaches the turtles. Seriously? The extent of Japanese culture they've really ever known of came from an instructional book? Words cannot justly express how much this bastardizes everything that Splinter and the Turtles are.
 Can somebody, anybody, tell me why they didn't just stick with Splinter and the turtles original origins? For those who don't know or can't remember, hear is verbatim their original origin story: ""In the original comic book version (TMNT vol. 1 issue 1 (May 1984), Hamato Yoshi was a high-ranking member of the Foot Clan in Japan. He owned a rat named Splinter, who copied his movements as he practiced ninjutsu. He was romantically involved with a woman named Tang Shen. However, their relationship attracted the jealousy of Oroku Nagi, who also loved Shen. When Nagi was rejected by her, he became enraged and violently beat her. Shortly after, Yoshi arrived and, in his fit of anger, murdered Nagi. He was dishonored for having killed another member of the Clan and forced to choose between death or exile to the United States. He chose the latter, and left with Shen and Splinter. Years later, Nagi's brother Oroku Saki climbed the ranks of the Foot to become assigned the leader of its New York branch. He followed the two lovers to New York City and killed them both in vengeance of Nagi. However, the rat Splinter escaped to the sewers and mutated along with the Turtles. He then proceeded to teach ninjutsu to the Turtles as he himself had learned it from Yoshi, in order to have them avenge his owner's death.""
 Isn't that just a mighty fine origin story? It links all the characters(good and bad)together and gives them the driving force to make them who and what they are. Simply put, it's just better than a mutated rat and 4 turtles acting like ninjas and using Japanese phrases all because they found a book about Ninjutsu, while having no connection to their enemy's. I'm always open minded towards change, when it makes sense, or improves upon what is already there, but this change is a major part of what kills this film.

5. Eric Sacks is the dumbest evil guy to ever exist. He helps create the mutagen that creates the TMNT for the sole purpose of selling it to the good citizens of New York right after he poisons them with another biological agent (the mutagen being the cure, somehow), probably the stupidest most pointless idea EVER, given that he's already filthy rich and the biological agent kills people almost instantly, so who is he going to sell the mutagen to?
 I'm not really sure how he was planning on getting away with this plan, as later in the movie he begins to release the deadly biological agent into the air from the spire at the top of his own companies building. The agent is a deep shade of red and it's broad daylight outside, everybody in New York would have to be incredibly stupid to not noticed red ""death"" causing gas coming out of Sacks industries tower.

6. Megan Fox is a horrible actress, there is nothing redeemable in her performance. Is this her worst performance? Probably not, but she's nothing more than substanceless T&A. Seriously, she has a close up butt shot, a deliberate close up bent over butt shot in what is supposed to be a kids film.

Kids will probably not notice or care about most of these issues, so they will probably still find some enjoyment in this film, but as for you adults, or long time fans of the comics, original movies, TV shows, games, or any other form of the TMNT mythos, you will likely think this is one of the most punishingly lackluster movies you've ever seen depicting your favorite bipedal turtles. It hurts me to no end to say such negative things about a TMNT movie like this, i've been a fan my whole life, you see? The TMNT mean something to me. To those who are saying that the people leaving negative reviews are ""just haters"", ""not true fans"", or giving excuses like ""it's just a kids movie, calm down"", you're missing the point. We are not haters. We are true fans. Being ""just a kids movie"" is not justification for it to be half-assed. There are 30 years worth of TMNT fans in the world now, and they all want to see a great TMNT film, but this is not that film.",1407542400,649,9641,4.67787610619469

6330037,1,B00J2T18XS,Not impressed. I went in with my son who is a fan of the current tv show (which is actually pretty good) but this movie didn't seem to have any heart to it like the cartoon does. The movie kept jumping from place to place which made it hard to follow and a lot of the one-liners were kinda lame. I don't normally judge acting but obviously don't look for any Daniel Day-Lewis or Leo DiCaprio performances. I know everyone has a favorite iteration of the Ninja Turtles from the comic books to the cartoons to the original movies but I wouldn't expect anything worth remembering or special from this. Worth a rent or wait to buy when it's on sale. Even my son just wanted to watch the cartoon after not knowing how to take in this film.,1407456000,15,734,4.287769784172662

___________________________________________________________

New York is under threat by a powerful group called the foot clan who've been terrorizing citizens in search for a serum. A newspaper reporter by the name of April O'Neil investigates a series of attacks until she discovers vigilante turtles on scene. With her help, the pact of Leonardo, Michelangelo, Donatello, and Raphael team to face the foot clan and their merciless leader The Shredder. If not stopped, New York will fall victim to a deadly attack with millions of lives hanging in the balance.

The film is directed by Jonathan Liebesman who was involved with `Battle Los Angeles` and `Wrath Of The Titans` with Michael Bay producing at his side. Megan Fox returns to the world of action after her involvement in the Transformers franchise that saw her and actor Shia Lebouf fighting side by side. The reboot of the Ninja Turtles is in many ways a fresh start to give a darker look into the characters of the turtles while being fun and entertaining as seen in previous films. Marketed heavily and even re-teaming with Pizza Hut is sure to bring audiences to the theater and relive the magic from generations past.

Expectations going into the new film were low considering Michael Bay's involvement and having the reputation of putting aesthetics and look over the script. To no surprise, the movie is fun as there are action sequences with the turtles battling Shredder's army; especially the fight towards the end. The character of Shredder, played by Tohoru Masamune, was the best part of the film. His armor that is to be revealed after the discovery of Eric Sack's (William Fichtner) involvement with Shredder looked great and had that touch of Bay in it. The turtles themselves had cool personalities with Michelangelo topping them and builds a crush on April O'Neal.

The film has its moments of entertainment that kids will definitely enjoy but stops short of being a great experience. From beginning to end you couldn't help but feel you were watching a Michael Bay movie. From the typical slow-mo action spots to the sensationalism of Megan Fox there definitely were beats from Bay here. Not trying to knock Michael Bay but it seemed like he was directing the film and not Liebesman. Although you can say with Liebesman's previous projects it would be hard to tell since the director and producer have similar qualities.

More attention was put on the aesthetics of the turtles and Shredder's costume that we get hallow characters from a hallow script. Megan Fox's portrayal of April O'Neal at first looked uncomfortable when she first arrived on screen giving an interview to a port worker on duty. Let's get this off the bat by saying the acting overall was mediocre with Fox being the best of the worst. There's something about Fox that makes it seem like she is better suited for other roles that are more for looks. Here, the direction of her character came off as a teenage kid who can't be taken seriously.

The ending leaves it open for sequels and will surely make its money on opening weekend. But many will feel disappointed by the lack of originality that will remind them of `The Amazing Spider-Man` and how the Lizard tried mutating humans into lizards. Not boring to say the least as the film spawned great fight scenes between Shredder and Splitter it did its job of providing entertainment. Ultimately, the movie is a let down and isn't memorable after leaving the theater.",1407456000,3,3528,4.921008403361345
6330040,5,B00J2T18XS,"Very faithful portrayal of the turtles as I remember them when I was a kid, plus the dialogue is hilarious, the action is awesome and the 3D is amazing.  The story isn't much, but serves its purpose for allowing the turtles to kick some shell.  Highly recommended.",1407456000,7,264,4.595744680851064
6330041,5,B00J2T18XS,"Very Suprised by how good it really is. They treated it with respect and had some of the best action scenes I have ever seen. Great comedy, and one badass villain.",1407456000,8,163,4.290322580645161
6330042,3,B00J2T18XS,"Do you want to know just how much people still care about the Teenage Mutant Nina Turtles? When it was announced that Michael Bay would merely be producing a new film featuring everyone's favorite pizza-eating turtles it sent fans spiraling into Crazy Town. They couldn't believe how Bay, again only in a producer role, was going to ruin their childhood favorites. To be fair, we've seen what Bay did to Transformers and purists hate those movies with the heat of a thousand suns. But the worst thing that can happen is to have nobody really give a darn, and obviously that was not the case here. But Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, which is a co-production between Bay's Platinum Dunes and Nickelodeon, isn't quite the disaster many expected it to be.

So that might not be the most ringing endorsement and probably won't get plastered in TV ads (""It's not so bad""--Travis Hopson, Punch Drunk Critics), but really that is the only criteria that matters when it comes to a movie like this. We already know it will be geared towards kids and the storyline will be ridiculous. Plus, let's be really honest here, the TMNT have undergone so many changes over the years that picking one version as definitive is sorta silly. After toying with the far-out notion of turning them into extraterrestrials, Bay and Liebesman have stuck to a fairly traditional take on the Turtles, one that longtime fans can appreciate if they don't mind the kiddie tone.

New York is under attack by an evil paramilitary organization known as the Foot Clan, led by a metal-clad ninja called Shredder. Of course, this having Bay's stamp of approval Shredder looks like the spawn of Optimus Prime and a cheese grater. On the tail of the secretive Foot is lowly TV reporter April O'Neil, played by former Bay frenemy Megan Fox. O'Neil can't get anyone at her network to believe her about the Foot, but she has a more difficult time convincing them she saw four giant vigilante turtles fighting back. Fortunately, she finds a willing ear in scientist Eric Sachs (William Fichtner), a friend and colleague of her late father. What she doesn't know is that Sachs is holding on to a dark secret, one that threatens her and Turtles' future.

Chances are you'll figure out where this plot, cobbled together from dozens of other blockbusters, is headed in the first ten minutes. But getting there does prove to be more fun than expected, largely due to a script that understands the relationship between the turtle siblings and Splinter (voiced by Tony Shalhoub), their overgrown rat sensei. Raphael is a hot-headed jerk, Donatello is a dork with a bo staff, Michelangelo is a laid back beach bum, while Leonardo (voiced by Johnny Knoxville) is the born leader. Conflicts arise amongst the group, particularly between Raph and Leo, while Mikey acts like a clown. What doesn't work so well is in the physical design of the Turtles. They are freaking massive, huge bulked-up creatures and it takes away from their supposed ninja abilities. Are we truly expected to believe they were able to be stealthy all these years fighting in the shadows? They're the size of Monster Trucks! It's absurd, and it clashes against the idea of them as teenagers. Granted, watching them zip through the sewers on skateboards, along with a healthy dose of childish fart humor, does a pretty good job of establishing their immaturity. Kids will eat that stuff up. Adults? Eh, maybe. They may also find Mikey's crush on April a little too mature (and weird) for kids to handle.

Through the alien war flick Battle: Los Angeles and Wrath of theTitans, Liebesman has established himself as a director whose style resembles that of Bay in just about every way. So it's no shock that visually this looks exactly like Transformers; big chaotic action that defies the laws of physics but looks amazing. The highlight is a 10-minute chase down a snowy slope with exploding trucks, Turtles on the half-shell, and Fox hanging for dear life. It looks amazing, although it doesn't make a lot of sense logistically. Why is there so much snow there but nowhere else in the city? We're probably not supposed to notice. Other plot holes will rear their ugly head, too, as the villains' main scheme makes absolutely no sense when revealed. This was a case of the writers' going too far in wanting a huge world-threatening finale when nothing we've seen up to that point suggests it should be the case. What you won't find is much in the way of emotion except in the brotherly camaraderie between the Turtles, and that is displayed mostly in broad strokes.

Despite their hulking size, the CGI Turtles look pretty good although the effects get a little sloppy during the faster fight sequences. Fox is back to her old bag of tricks as little more than a pretty face. She gets a lot of reaction shots and not much else to do, but at least she wears O'Neil's classic yellow jacket! Will Arnett gets a few laughs as her cameraman and potential suitor, Vernon Fenwick. Fichtner is so good at playing quirky, mannered bad guys that it's disappointing he's so boring here. Sachs just isn't written to be a funny character and it's a waste of what Fichtner does best. Somebody should have shown these guys Fichtner's Drive Angry highlight reel.

So you may not be shouting ""Cowabunga"" but at least it's not 'The Secretof the Ooze'. There aren't any Vanilla Ice cameos to speak of and that's automatically a good thing. As an introduction to younger audiences and an action-packed slice of nostalgia, you could do worse than Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.",1407456000,11,5569,4.795833333333333
6330043,3,B00J2T18XS,"Spoiler Alert: Surprisingly decent,  just not too memorable. Megan Fox was actually okay as April despite not being the best choice. And I'm pleased to say that William Fichtner (Armageddon) isn't playing Shredder as it was reported. He plays a scientist named Eric Sacks.
  Shredder is in fact Asian like in the show and he brought up Sacks. But their evil plot to make Sacks rich by unleashing a virus that only he can cure is silly. Since if Shredder is Sacks'sensai why would he care about making his student rich ?
  So Sacks wasn't a necessary character in the movie. It's Karai; Shredder brought up as his own in the show. Splinter just being a rat all along and never human took some fun out of it for me. Karai not being Splinter's daughter made her pretty much just there for the hell of it.
  So the casting didn't turn out as bad as expected but the plot needed work. While  the newer Nickelodeon cartoon series has me more interested in what will happen next than this movie does. The film is some-what less cheesy than the original films but still nothing spectacular.",1407456000,4,1082,4.541237113402062

6330048,5,B00J2T18XS,"When I purchased this DVD, I knew it would come with a minimal amount of content. It's pretty much the episodes and that's it. The extras are not expanded upon in the box art and that's probably because they are really only worth a ""hmm, that's nice"" from all but the most die-hard viewers. The episodes themselves feel a little bit longer than the roughly 22 minute time stamp they receive. I think that's due in part to the high quality voice acting and CG animation throughout.

One point i would like to mention for first-time viewers is, the episodes do follow a slowly moving story arc. So, while starting on this DVD will not leave a first-time viewer scratching their heads, there may be plot points in progress that cause confusion because they were laid out in earlier episodes. I would personally recommend starting from the beginning from a plot standpoint, but most children are probably so excited to see the turtles and their antics that plot becomes a side note.

There's no blood in the show and most of the violence takes on comic book-like effects. One thing that separates this series from  the other television series in the past, is the use of universal menga (or anime) expressions. Things like the single sweat drop, beady squiggly eyes, the single popped vein and so on. These are usually found in the world of Japanese animation and are used to express extreme emotion. Nothing to be worried about and it doesn't detract from the series, it was just a new direction I thought I would point out.

So, should you buy it? I did. But I have also bought every DVD released for the series thus far. Would I pick up this disk in particular for being the best in the series? Nope. I think TMNT: The Ultimate Showdown (and end of season 1) is the best thus far, but it is mostly wrapping up the plot of the first season, so there is a lot of climax. I also wouldn't chose this DVD as an introduction because it is part 2 of season 2 and as I mentioned before, there is a slowly moving story arch. The first part of the season being TMNT: Mutagen Mayhem.

So, who is this for? People who are die hard turtle fans, those who are collecting the series and those young enough or impressionable enough to not care about being in the middle of an over-arching plot line.",1405123200,3,2281,4.4735576923076925

6330050,5,B00J2T18XS,"While the original cartoon series from the 80s had a different plot and a new Shredder henchman every week, Nickelodeon's version borrows the serial storyline from the 2003 series, while at same time bringing back a few of the characters from the 80s cartoons that only made one or two appearances. The new twist on the Casey Jones character is that he is a teenager that goes to school with April and Irma. Slash's back-story has been altered and is no longer one of Shredder's henchmen, but instead he was Raphael's pet turtle, Spike, who was mutated into a giant-turtle with an attitude problem.

Though most die-hard adult fans will complain that this is just another six-episode release instead of a complete season, it doesn't bother me at all. The new series is targeted at children and not adults, though plenty of adults do watch it. Parents will most likely be able to afford to buy a $15 DVD than a complete series between $30 to $40 dollars. Nickelodeon will probably use the same format as the first season and release the last episodes of the season on a two-disc set sometime this fall around the time third season officially starts.

Overall, the six episodes on the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: The Good, The Bad, And Casey Jones DVD are funny and action-packed.

Episodes on the single-disc DVD are:

  Slash and Destroy - Corey Feldman (the voice of Donatello in the 90s live-action trilogy) voices Slash, Raphael's pet turtle (Spike), who was accidentally mutated into a giant, angry turtle.

  The Kraang Conspiracy - When the turtles investigate the Kraang's activity at the newly-rebuilt TCRI plant, they will finally discover what the aliens want with April.

  The Good, The Bad, And Casey Jones - After appearing along side April in a few episodes, the crime-fighting masked teen, Casey Jones, is introduced to the turtles, when he fights along side Raphael.

  Fungus Humungous - When mutated sentient mushrooms spread throughout the sewers, April, Casey and the turtles start hallucinating their worst fears.

  Metalhead Rewired - Donatello has rewired his robotic creation Metalhead with several new features that will come in handy when they go out to stop another Kraang invasion.

  Of Rats and Men- The Rat King returns, but this time he has an army of mutated rats at his disposal.

6330052,3,B00J2T18XS,"I only recently found out that a tape of this entire show was released (I'd seen a making-of tape in stores when it was new) so I tracked down a copy. While it's not in the same league as HR Pufnstuf Live at the Hollywood Bowl, it's still great and a must-have for anyone into this kind of stuff. Decent songs (no songwriting credits are given), and a hokey thing with the bad guy hating music with a message at the end that music conquers all (we've seen this all before), but that's the whole point.

BIG negative however from the shoddy treatment given by Goodtimes- they were one of the first bargain-basement video companies that cut costs by issuing tapes recorded at the slower speeds, even when the material could have easily fit on a tape in SP mode. Considering this was a brand-new show when the tape was released, you'd think they'd spare a few more expenses, but even though you get a shiny tape cover with raised lettering, inside is the same awful-quality tape that Goodtimes has been famous for. It's recorded in the LP mode, and there's no Hi-Fi audio track. Luckily I have a VCR that can play linear stereo (most current VCRs can't) but the audio is still in mono. This deserved so much better- Pioneer Artists should have licensed this for a laserdisc release, I would have bought it!
