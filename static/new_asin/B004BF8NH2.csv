8421942,5,B004BF8NH2,"This is an engaging medical drama from Ireland. I saw series 1 on Netflix and became hooked but they never offered any other seasons. Found this on Amazon, the complete series. Each season is only 8-10 episodes so it is easy to binge watch. Note, these are not Region 1 DVD's so they will not play in a generic DVD player. You need a more expensive player that plays all regions or the easier way is to watch on a laptop or play on a laptop and transfer it to TV with HDMI cable or Google Chrome.",1403827200,2,496,4.123711340206185
8421943,1,B004BF8NH2,"I purchased this set because it said for all regions. This isn't true. It willnot play on any of my dd players
This is false advertising and buyer beware. What a ripoff. Amazon needs to stop saying it is for all regions.
It really should be zero stars.
I emailed this sellar on December 31st and have not heard anything from them.
Don't purchase anything from them.",1356566400,3,365,4.462686567164179
8421944,5,B004BF8NH2,Even though it is not region 1 (US region) it plays fine on my PC.  The show is AWESOME!  I am so glad I got it!,1355788800,,112,3.269230769230769
8421945,5,B004BF8NH2,"This is a great series with interesting characters and dramatic situations.  I like the fact that it's based more on the doctors than on the patients, since I'm not a huge fan of medical dramas.  The lives of the characters really suck you in.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that some of the characters disappeared without much of an explanation.  I know that not all actors choose to stick around for more seasons, but it would be nice if their departure was worked into the storyline, rather than just having them vanish with the beginning of the new season.  I highly recommend to enjoys a good series.",1349740800,2,617,4.5225225225225225
8421946,1,B004BF8NH2,"I ordered this DVD set and when it arrived it would not play on my DVD player (both of them).  On the box it said region 0, which implies region-free, but when I loaded a disc into either my Toshiba DVD player or my Sony DVD player neither of them could read it.  I live in the USA and ended up having to return the set back to Ireland (where the seller was located), and thus had to eat the cost of international postage ($16 thank you USPS!).",1348444800,4,444,4.034090909090909
8421947,4,B004BF8NH2,"My wife and I recently purchased this set and had it shipped from Ireland after reading good review elsewhere on the internet.  We have watched seasons one and two so far, and I enjoy it overall.  It really is more of a relationship drama than a medical drama.  The actors / actresses are very good.  Fiona in particular shines as ""that one psycho coworker""  that we've all had.  I must say her craziness is dead on. I have had crazy coworkers before, and I instantly knew what fiona was thinking about on the show! The show basically alternates between patient / dr. interactions with each staff member (with some returning, some new patients), and drama between the staff members.  I find the patient interactions the least interesting, because many of the patients don't return after one episode so i'm not invested in those characters.  The thing that really hooked me was wondering how badly they were going mess up their own lives with terrible decisions. And the mess-ups are epic.

All in all, this is a pretty enjoyable show, although I found myself fast forwarding the parts with the psychologist.  he is the least interesting character in the first two seasons.",1329696000,,1172,4.786069651741293
