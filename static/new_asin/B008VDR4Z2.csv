8569040,4,B008VDR4Z2,I like the DVD. It gives me a more better insight on the workings of the computer. I can say that I have gained more knowledge than I had before.,1379894400,,145,3.8666666666666667
8569041,5,B008VDR4Z2,"Overall I found this tutorial to be very informative. It offers adequate details to actually build a basic computer. I have built two computers in the past for my own use, and still learned a couple of things here - specifically regarding the types and use of RAM, and differences in packaging (OEM vs Retail)of the components. The layout of the tutorial is nice - uncluttered, simple yet delivers the details being given. Lighting and camera setup is excellent. It doesn't bog things down with too much details while still delivering enough information to actually allow you to build the system. I Also liked that he went to the web sites to show prices and where to get specs for the parts for the build. Even for me, already having enough understanding to build a computer system, this offers good information that is useful, and done in a logical straightforward way.",1350086400,4,871,4.774834437086093
