644408,1,6303439152,"I love reading Eric Carle's books to my toddler, but I found this to be very dreary.  Everytime I put it on he didn't even glance at it.",1013904000,3,136,3.857142857142857
644409,5,6303439152,"this video is wonderful! i have used it for a literature/video comparison activity for my ""children's literature class"" and it was full of details.",987638400,,147,5.166666666666667
644410,5,6303439152,"My kids are 8 and 5 and still enjoy watching this video at bedtime or just to wind down. Its five recitations of Eric Carle stories backed by wonderful music and imaginative artwork make it appropriate for anybody. I wish another video of Carle's books would be made; we've played this one endlessly! The narrators' voices are soft and calming, and the artwork is splendid, especially the last piece set to classical music. It makes a nice accompaniment to the books, but also stands well on its own. I highly recommend this video for baby, toddler, or child alike.",970531200,18,565,4.717171717171717
644411,5,6303439152,"My son and I have been enjoying this movie for over a year.  We have a wonderful time enjoying it; it even caused us to buy what has become his favorate book, ""Papa Please Get The Moon For Me"", which is  included in this video.",937958400,,227,4.022222222222222

7846720,5,6303439152,"We received this item earlier than estimated date. It plays good too! Our children liked this movie, that's cute for kids. Thank you & have a good day!",1399852800,,151,4.428571428571429
7846721,5,6303439152,"When I was very young I watched this.

Watching it again gives me a warm breath of nostalgia. Also the music is better than I remembered.",1368921600,,137,4.269230769230769
7846722,5,6303439152,"I grew up loving this VHS, especially the last one set to classical music. I'd actually like to learn how to play it, so if anybody would happen to know the title of the piece, let me know!!",1349222400,,190,4.026315789473684
7846723,5,6303439152,"The Very Hungry Catepillar and the other related stories by Eric Carle are wonderful for young children, ages 1-7.  The stories are charming, calming and soothing.  My 2-1/2 year old grandson watches this over and over and I even enjoy watching it with him.  Other stories include:  ""PaPa can you get me the Moon, The Very Quiet Cricket and The Chameleon.""  It likes reading a story book to your young child.  I also purchased the books as a back-up to read to my grandson.  He also likes to read the books ""all by himself,"" and some day soon he will be able to do so.  I highly recommend this video as welcome relief from the fast-paced cartoonish shows on TV.",1148083200,,661,4.45
7846724,4,6303439152,"I have to say that I was wary of this tape.  I had a hard time imagining that Disney would do a good job with the stylized artwork of Eric Carle.  (One only has to look at the abysmal job that MGM did with Stella Luna to be wary for life.)

BUT, this video is very nice.  The artwork is very 'Carle-esque' and they actually added some cute elements to the stories.  For example, the facial expressions on the caterpillar were very appropriate.  He smiled, he looked a little ill after he had eaten all the food, etc.

My only complaint is that the music was a little loud in places, actually making it hard to hear the narrator.  If you are familiar with the narrators of the Scholastic series, I will also add that the two narrators on this video are not as good.  Okay, but not top notch.

Still my two, boy and girl/3 and 5 years-old, certainly didn't care.  They adore this video and we watch it whenever we have some downtime.

Four stars.  Great video that is not frenetic and perfectly okay for the evening hours.  Minus one for music that was a little loud in places",1121644800,,1074,4.278606965174129
7846725,5,6303439152,"My kids, 5, 3, and 2 all are enchanted by this video.  I will put it in after a long afternoon of playing outside, or when they just need to relax their bodies.  It has a soothing, gentle quality to it, and they will all sit quietly for the whole thing.  I wish there were more Eric Carle videos available, but this is great for now.

We love it here at our house!!",1116288000,,365,3.958904109589041
7846726,5,6303439152,"This tape has been an excellent addition to our collection.  My girls have enjoyed the Very Hungry Caterpillar book, but I think they have enjoyed the tape as much or more, with the additional stories, art and music.  I agree that the ""I See a Song"" is a highlight, at least for me.  But my kids enjoy sitting through the entire tape, which is calming and mesmerizing.  When my kids need to wind down, this is an excellent choice.",1111449600,,430,4.405063291139241
7846727,1,6303439152,"I just finished watching this tape.  I have to say that the I found the endings to each of the stories...anti climactic.  ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" and ""The Very Quiet Cricket"" actually have no story.  It's just a day in the life of these creatures.  The Cricket story was the worst.  Why could he not make a noise?  Eric Carle never explains.  Your kids will ask.  In ""Papa, Please Get The Moon For Me"", a spoiled child plays with the moon...and it concludes with another odd ending.  The only story with any type of message is ""The Mixed-Up Chameleon""...the message: Just be yourself...and you will be content.  ""I See a Song"" is the highlight of the tape, but it's more of a music video (i.e. Fantasia).  I doubt my family will be popping this tape in again anytime soon.  I like stories that stimulate the mind and make you think or laugh...these stories did neither.  The odd part of this review...so far everybody has said it was not any help to them.  Why not?  It's an honest review.  Is it because it's a negative review?  Well, I hope it helps somebody make a decision.  Some may like this story...personally, I look for something better for my kid.  But, unlike some of the other parents who love it, I don't plop my kid down for hours and make them watch the same thing over and over again for hours and hours.  If that's what you do with your kids, maybe this is the video for that.",1074384000,2,1399,4.411764705882353
7846728,5,6303439152,"I love this video, and so does my 4-year old daughter. The images are beautiful, as is Eric Carle's artwork in general; the music fits the style and stories well; even the narration of the stories is great. I was actually hoping I would find more of Carle's stories on video for Christmas... I definitely recommend this one to anyone, kids and adults alike. It is really nicely done.",1038009600,10,383,4.565217391304348
