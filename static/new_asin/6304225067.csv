7867440,4,6304225067,"""La Ardilla Roja"" (""The Red Squirrel"") is a Spanish language film with available English subtitles (which I used as my Spanish isn't good enough to keep up with faster-paced dialogue; I found the subtitles to be quite well done). First unveiled at Cannes in 1993, this film opens with very complex and nuanced dialogue (""My eyes are tangled with sleep..."") and proceeds to introduce the dream world of amnesia and questions about personal identity. Jota (or Jay; Nancho Novo) is a washed up rock singer from a band called ""Las Moscas"" (""The Flies"") which has a hit named ""Elisa"" (the music video clip is great; sample lyrics: ""Elisa, dream, bird of blue iron and salt..."") After losing his girlfriend, Jota is on the verge of suicide when he sees a motorbike run off a boardwalk. He finds a beautiful girl (Emma Surez) was riding it and tells medical personnel that her name is Lisa (after his song) and they live together since she's suffering from total amnesia.

Director Julio Medem skillfully intercuts intriguing and sometimes menacing squirrel-related shots throughout the film; all of them are seemingly symbolic but figuring out how is the hard part, though it becomes easier as the film progresses. The first major squirrel diversion comes via a televised squirrel documentary (where we learn that red squirrels are stronger than their peers and have stronger and longer claws on their back legs than in front); later on there are some interesting squirrel point of view shots which I found particularly inspired. (I also never thought I'd see a squirrel stealing prawns and eating shrimp in a tree.) Lest you think I'm making too big a deal out of the squirrel footage, the next phase of the film sees Jota and ""Lisa"" getting reacquainted. After springing her from the hospital (and seeing his great music video), they go to La Ardilla Roja campsite to take a vacation. Seemingly trivial traits become apparent: Lisa, in addition to being beautiful, is an excellent swimmer, and likes to test Jota's reflexes; some of these traits prove significant while others don't (or I just missed their significance, a definite possibility). The campground is an odd place (note especially the peculiar operatic shower scene) filled with odd people (like the purple-haired staff and disagreeable taxi driver who thinks he's a race car driver) and as such proves to be a place to both enhance and test relationships as nobody there is quite what they seem (or at least pretend) to be.

Eventually reality catches up for the couple: hypnosis reveals that Lisa is actually named Sofia and she studies zoology; despite reports that she's deranged, the animals seem to symbolically turn against Jota: a squirrel even overtly beans Jay on the head with a pine cone in an aggressive act of squirrel mayhem, though he's OK despite the head injury. Ultimately the movie comes to a climax when the taxi driver turns the couple in to Sofia's husband Felix (Carmelo Gomez), and no good comes of that. Felix shows up at the campsite and in an astonishing turn of events that reinforces Medem's mastery of the visual aesthetic, cuts a hole in his face with a pair of scissors in a scene you will never forget. This leads incongruously to one of the most astonishingly odd chase scenes ever filmed with a simply unreal ending.

Although seemingly losing Sofia, what has Jota really lost? He tracks her to the Madrid zoo where he sees her in a red jumpsuit employed as a squirrel tender. As the film ends a squirrel poops on Jota and he and Sofia embrace, all the while being watched by the squirrel, which sees all. Did Sofia even have amnesia? Perhaps only the squirrel knows for sure.

The DVD has some interesting extras including an interview with director Julio Medem, production stills, a trailer, and a musical clip from the video.

I really liked ""La Ardilla Roja"" though it took me a couple of times watching it to uncover the subtleties and symbolism, and frankly there's so much here I'm sure more would be revealed to me if I watched it several more times. The film is ethereally beautifully shot, with wonderful direction, lighting, and cinematography, and the cast is masterful at playing obtuse, complex characters whose motivations aren't always what you might expect. The subtitles are good, and even though watching it in the original Spanish (which I also did) probably gives the purest viewing experience, the film shines even when subtitled. This is not light viewing, but it is eminently enjoyable and worthwhile, and definitely makes you contemplate the limitations of reality and self-identity.",1473724800,,4603,4.918918918918919
7867441,3,6304225067,"Jay (Nancho Nova) takes Lisa (Emma Suarez) to hospital after witnessing her motorbike crash, and believing her to have amnesia, pretends to be her boyfriend. Spanish director Julio Medem wants to seduce us with a thriller, with the music of Albert Iglesias, and the film opens with the camera moving underwater. Though the initial exposition is stodgy, it soon starts to become mysterious and hypnotic. However the tension dissipates when we relocate to the Red Squirrel campsite, and other characters are introduced. It's hard to accept Jay as a romantic since Nova is such a creepy vampire, but Suarez more than compensates, showing some of the sensuality Sharon Stone released in Basic Instinct, even if Medem is as objectifying as Paul Verhoeven was. The solution to the amnesia is dismissed unsatisfactorily, and when Suarez's husband turns up and we cut to a large pair of scissors, we only have to wait for them to be used grossly. The film has a few stinkers - Medem shouldn't be encouraged to make a musical, some squirrel point of view shots, and a pair of hair-dyed lesbians in the campsite who smile knowingly.",992649600,6,1122,4.910526315789474
7867442,4,6304225067,"This is a pretty good movie that evolves  around a victims amnesia. Julio Medem directs this beauty about identities lost and reinvented. Menden's roots for ""Tierra"" are here and are displayed quite nicely. There is some very good editing that gives the movie a good pace and some out of the ordinary cuts that dazzle visually. The two main characters are Lisa, as played by the attractive ""rubia"" Emma Suarez, and Jota or Jay as played by Nancho Suarez. Their chance meeting begins while Jota is about to go suey and suddenly a moto/motorcycle goes crashing over the rail for a two story plunge on to the sand at the beach. Jota, a musician with a broken heart ""helps"" her out and lies to her and authorites and ""helps"" her recover from amnesia. The story takes place mostly at a campground, the Red Squirrel, hence the name of the movie. One of the interesting things about good movies made from outside the US is seeing a portrait of other cultures. It is very interesting to see the differences and this movie does a great job at illustrating that, although that was probably not the intent. The campground is an excellent place to show these differences as is evident in the way people treat each other at the campground, almost communal in nature. The Europeans are very touchy feely and the scene where Lisa meets a neighbor camper shows the cultural differences. They hug and kiss on each cheek as an introduction, a little different from a nod or a  hand shake, if that, in the US. A friendly relationship develops, except for a reluctant Jota, between the two ""families"". From here the story takes off as the audience learns about Lisa. Many things are revealed in the movie about both main characters in the process. Overall I enjoyed this movie and felt it showed the sadness some people have after a heart break and the lenghts they will go to mend their hearts.  The movie is not one bit sappy, even a little strange in parts. There is enough going on to keep you guessing throughout the movie, which keeps you wondering and constantly trying to figure out the why. This is a good movie from a very talented Spanish director who I'd like to see more of.",980035200,11,2167,4.579896907216495
