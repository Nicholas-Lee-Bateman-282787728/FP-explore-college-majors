1636755,5,B00005NRQO,"This movie is funny! Very funny, you'll start jumping up and down, breaking every furniture your parents buy, and well kill yourself if you're absolutely insane! It's the continuation of dr.dolittle 1 which was absolutely funny. This second version is when dr.dolittle discovers the fact humans are killing nature burning down the animals homes. It was time to take action. After he visited his fello friends in the jungle, dr.dolittle was surprised to hear from his animal friends that humans were looking for trouble buy burning down trees that weren't so important for us but was important for squirells, beavers and birds aswell. So he goes up to people and tell them all about the problems happening to these animals and blabers on and on about keeping nature clean and a place for evry one to live. But that's not where the fun begins. Ofcourse, the number one laughter in this movie was when dr.dolittle was awoked by a bear in his house and when the bear was talking to him at the time his daughter was. Obviously his daughter didn't really know a huge bear behind her was talking to her dad, who was so kind enough to listen to the both of them in where i think he got confused to whom she should say what! I know, it was confusing and sometimes that's the fun of this movie. It ends up gr8 but what is more gr8 to talk about is the fact most movies are about animals which is fun especially these hilarious ones like cats and dogs. You can order this special movie with a surprise of seeing cats and dogs aswell. Before they're out of stock, buy these two or else you'll feel awfully sorry for not doing that!",1004054400,,1619,4.491525423728813
1636756,5,B00005NRQO,"Dr Dolittle 2 was one of the funniest movies I saw in 2001 so when the dvd come out Oct 23 I bought it. This sequel was actually funnier than the first one although I have both movies. This movie features some of the same characters that was in the first movie. Most of the animal characters are different but luckey the dog and the rats are in it. The disc is loaded with extras such as 2 theatrical trailers and 12 tv spots,making movie magic with Rytham and Hues,a music video by cluck cluck and a lot of other extras. It also has outakes but unless you have a dvd player with nuon feature you can't see the out takes which is unfortunate because only a few of the newer models have this incorporated. Now that I've seen this one I look foward to Dr Dolittle 3 coming out in a couple of years hopefully at least 3 and hope it will be as funny as this one.",1003881600,,858,4.0828402366863905
1636757,4,B00005NRQO,"Not often do you find a sequel that is better than it's predecessor but, in Dr. Dolittle 2 you definitely do!! (Hey, that rhymes!)
The first movie though funny, felt a bit dry and as if it were missing something. Well, this sequel found the missing part! It was charming and heartwarming. The premise was well written and Archie the bear was adorable! Trying to guess who were the many famous voice-overs kept us on our toes. And the human<->animal interactions were superb.
The DVD version is well done. The commentaries, behind the scenes look, children's game and extended scenes are a nice change from many DVD's that have very weak ""Extra Features"". This movie is geared more toward children, though it does have some dialoge and a couple of scenes that are bit crude but, nothing that should ruin a family movie night. The movie's big message is that everyone should be loved and accepted for who they are, and I think it hit it's mark!",1002844800,,942,4.6467065868263475

Also, the animal voices, many of them are very familiar (like Chris Rock and Cedric the Entertainer). If you like one and two, then you might want to check out ""Dr. Doolittle 3"".

The story and dialouge are so mind-numbing, even the animated Murphy and Raven Symone, who plays his teenage daughter, couldn't salvage it.  The story revolves around Dr. Doolittle trying to save the patch of forest behind his house from a land-hungry developer.  To do this, Doolittle must rehab a tame bear and make him wild, because this bear is an endangered species, and if he lives in the forest, the developer can't touch it.  Sounds kind of cute . . . it's not.

The bear acts and sounds like a washed up Vegas lounge singer.  His whiny voice (Steve Zahn) is so annoying that even I, a passionate animal lover, could not summon a shred of sympathy for this bear.  And talk about long.  This whole thin storyline is dragged out for ninety minutes until I writhed in pain.  And the other animals!  A sad, alcoholic French monkey, a chamelon with a horrible Mexican accent, and an abusive bear and his passive female bear.  When the bear is not whining, a dog is narrating the whole film in another nasal, bland voice with HORRIBLE dialouge.

A subplot involves his daughter rebelling and liking a boyfriend who is a complete idiot, is dropped off by a pizza delivery car and asks to stay two nights.  Murphy actually acquieses.  What an intelligent, lovely girl like Raven would see in this sorry homie is completely unbelievable.

It is hard to believe people (and animals) are going hungry when millions were wasted on this fart of a film.  It seemed like the voice actors were embarrased to be saying such stupid dialouge, and that the animal actors were embarrased to be acting such stupid roles - and I don't blame them.",1108771200,,1870,4.511904761904762

1636861,4,B00005NRQO,"The sequel to the very popular DR DOOLITTLE delivers again in DR DOOLITTLE 2.  Eddie Murphy and Norm McDonald return in this great family comedy.  You can bet that there are more great laughs and again that same cute comedy is in this one.
John Doolittle (Murphy) now a world renowned medical doctor for both humans and animals is called to action because an endangered species of bears is becoming more at risk.  It's up to Dr Doolittle to find a perfect mating pair and get them to mate.  He has one problem though, the male bear that he finds is Archie (Steve Zahn) and he's been in captivity all his life and doesn't know anything about living in the wild.  It's up to Dr Doolittle and Lucky (Norm McDonald) to teach Archie the ropes so that he can become a wild bear and mate with a female.
I thought that this one had it's share of laughs.  The little iguana is really funny and Archie the bear is pretty funny too.  Plus the rest of the animals in the forest are pretty funny.  My only problem is that as usual, a ferret is portraying a weasel.  Although ferrets are very closely related to them, It was a bit silly on why they didn't just get a weasel.  And a cameo by the Crocodile Hunter Steve Irwin doesn't hurt.
This is another great family comedy that kids will love not only for the animals but because it has a lot of child related comedy and adults will laugh at this one too.  Check out DR DOOLITTLE 2 and don't forget to get DR DOOLITTLE!",1042156800,12,1456,4.2773722627737225

1636864,5,B00005NRQO,"This was far better than the first Dr. Dolittle, although it was a good one too. Many of the one liners throughout the movie are common household one liners now. Archie (Steve Zahn) makes the movie absolutely a riot.",1020816000,,216,4.564102564102564
1636865,4,B00005NRQO,"""Dr. Dolittle 2"" was a cute movie.  It was definitely better that it's prequel and it actually had a good plot:  A logging company wants to tear down hundreds of acres of forest-- leaving the animals that live there homeless.  Dr. Dolittle (with the help of his animal friends) comes up with a plot to save the forest!  An endangered species of bears lives in the forest,  but there is only one...a female.  In order to save the forest, Dr. Dolittle must successfully mate the female with another male of the same species.  There's a catch-- the only male available is a tamed circus bear!  Dr. Dolittle has one month to turn ""Wayne Newton with fur"" into a real outdoor bear and get him to mate with the female.
  Anyway, the story is pretty cute so the film was definitely enjoyable.  What made the movie really fun, of course, were the talking animals!  How can you go wrong with talking animals?!  Steve Zahn voices the totally funny (and goofy) Archie, the tame dancing bear, while Lisa Kudrow voices Eva, the female bear.  There were lots of other talking animals (of course) but I'm not sure about did the voices.  I think Arnold Schwarzenegger was actually the voice of the Alpha Wolf, Joey Lauren Adams was the cute little Squirrel, and Andy Dick was the Weasel, but that's all I got.
  Hmmm.  I don't really have much more to say about the movie.  Eddie Murphy was hilarious as usual, what more can I say?  I love Eddie!  My only complaint: There was a little potty humor (which I don't much like) but not too much to disgust me...it was ok.
Recommendation:  ""Dr. Dolittle 2"" is a cute movie with funny talking animals and stars the side-splitting Eddie Murphy.  Unlike most movies of this caliber (talking animals and such) the plot was very interesting and very believable-- assuming you believe the whole understanding animals thing.  Let the kids see this one, it's got a great environmentalist message (save our forests!) and it's very funny.",1020124800,6,1956,4.652046783625731

1636868,1,B00005NRQO,"This entire movie seems to be orchestrated by someone with EXTREME environmental views. The good Dr Doolittle must save the poor, defenseless animals of the forest from the evil Republican forest industry...>Why does the movie industry constantly attempt to steer our fertile minded children toward their own political views?",1016064000,3,325,5.653061224489796
1636874,2,B00005NRQO,"One critic called Dr. Doolittle 2 an unnecessary sequel. What was the guy thinking? Any time a studio has a huge hit, as the original Doolittle certainly was, the idea of a franchise comes up. Sometimes this isn't possible. Titanic, for instance, ends with the ship's sinking and the hero's drowning. End of story. Still, I wouldn't be surprised if a Hollywood executive or two hasn't lost sleep trying to figure out a way to make Titanic II. Sequels are among the movie's most reliable income producers. It doesn't matter if the original itself wasn't very good. If the public bought enough tickets, then rented enough videos, that's all the reason a studio needs to try and recreate, if the magic, then the revenue.
Eddie Murphy is back as John Doolittle. He hasn't lost his ability to talk to animals; in fact, his days are filled with talking animals as well as people. I don't know how he copes. His bickering family would be enough for most men to deal with. One day a raccoon comes to his door and tells him that he needs to come to a nearby forest logging company is about to destroy. Doolittle discovers that there is an endangered species of bear in the forest. When the doctor runs across a trained male bear named Archie [voice of Steve Zahn] in a circus, he obtains a court order which allows him thirty days to see if Archie will mate with Ava [Lisa Kudrow], the bear living in he woods. Archie doesn't like the idea of life in the wild. He much prefers city life. Ava, easily the smartest mammal in the movie, doesn't think Archie can be much of a provider. Doolittle and his animal pals must persuade the reluctant couple that the other forest creatures are depending on them.
The plot is as silly as it is unoriginal, but there are amusing moments and enough cute, cuddly critters to keep the kids happy for an hour and a half.
There could have been no sequel without Eddie Murphy, who starred in the original. While he plays the part with his usual good cheer, there sadly isn't enough focus on him. He is, after all, one of the great comic actors of his generation. Here the animals get most of the attention and the laughs, giving Murphy little choice but to be little more than the world's highest paid straight man.
Dr. Doolittle 2 continues Hollywood's current obsession with jokes about lower digestion tract functions. Current thinking among child psychologists is that it's healthy for children to be open about their bodies. Maybe so, but does that mean we also have to teach them that it's fine to laugh at the crudest humor? All I know for sure is that I have become bored by this trend in movies. I hope that scriptwriter's will soon.",1015891200,2,2664,4.552083333333333
1636875,5,B00005NRQO,"I love this movie for some many reasons. The first reason is that Eddie always make me laugh. Raven-Symone and Lil' Zane and Kyla Pratt give great appeal for the teenage audience. Second the animals in the movie were hiralously funny. The best part was when the animals stike back at the land developers. You have got to see that part of the movie it is so funny.
I also like the general theme which is to protect animals because animals have feelings too. It really make you think each time a forest get destroy what happens to the poor animals. I think it is a good lesson for children to learn. To take care of the animals and the earth. I believe this film is great for the whole family and should be a family favorite at any home.",1010793600,4,735,4.257142857142857
1636876,3,B00005NRQO,"The movie opens in San Francisco with Dr. Dolittle (Eddie Murphy) and wife Lisa (Kristen Wilson) celebrating their 16-year old daughter's birthday.  Daughter Charisse (Raven-Symone) has developed an attitude about sharing her birthday with her family and also seems to be troubled by something, but won't tell her parents what it is.  While the dinner/party goes on, Dr. Dolittle is summoned first by a opossum then by a raccoon, to go see The Beaver (the animal kingdom's equivalent of the Mafia).  The doc, raccoon and opossum go to see The Beaver in the country and doc learns that the animals are upset because the humans are cutting down their home.  A bad guy named Joseph Potter is cutting down all the woods because there is money to be made in the process.  Doc's wife is a lawyer who says that one way to stop Potter is to prove there is an endangered species living in the wooded area.  Enter Archie, a circus bear raised by humans, and Ava, a wild bear living in the woods.  Archie and Ava are rare Pacific Western bears and if Dr. Dolittle can get them together, the woods will be saved as the two bears will be living there.  The good doctor sets about teaching Archie the ways of the wild in the hopes that Ava will fall for him.  There is one set-back after another with the re-training of Archie and also a pleasant surprise for Dolittle regarding his daughter, Charisse.
There are many entertaining and funny moments in this movie but I think it falls a little short of the original.  Even though I believe the first Dr. Dolittle is better, this movie is definitely worth buying, as any Eddie Murphy movie is.  Something tells me there will be a Dr. Dolittle 3 and I will probably buy that one too.",1010188800,2,1716,4.538961038961039
1636877,3,B00005NRQO,"Eddie Murphy is a very funny guy, and he holds this movie together.  He depicts the famous Dr. Dolittle, whose claim to fame is that he talks to animals.  Not just SOME animals, but to ALL animals.  As if they all talk the same language--English, of course.

The movie is apparently a frank propaganda piece for Earth First! but that's okay, because it is still funny and good entertainment.

The villain, a timber baron of course, brags that he took on the Democrats and so he should be able to handle Dr. Dolittle--  implying that he is a Republican, for certainly all Republicans are villains and all villains are Republicans.

Even so, it was a funny movie.  One must simply ignore the green garbage message and enjoy it.  As someone recently said, ""A rattlesnake loose in the living room tends to end all discussion of animal rights.""

Surprisingly, this turned out to be better (in my opinion) than the first Dr. D.
There are times when the actions of the animals don't seem to fluidly match their speech and intended emotions, but hey, it's to be expected.  As is typical with a movie intended for the younger generation, there is plenty of bodily humor, though some of the narrative almost borders on the adult when referring to sex.  It never goes overboard though, and while it may never become a classic in the sense of the book, you'll end up with a contented sigh by the time the film comes to an end.",1008806400,,764,4.404255319148936
