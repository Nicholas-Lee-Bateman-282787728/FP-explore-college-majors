8221708,5,B000W90JJQ,"COLOSSUS AND THE HEADHUNTERS begins w/ a catastrophic, volcanic explosion on a small island. This puts the tribe that lives there in great peril. Luckily, Colossus (aka: Maciste- Kirk Morris) arrives, looking smart in his fringed mini-skirt and matching boots, just in time to save many of the inhabitants. Loading them onto his big boat, he sets out to find a new place for the tribe to live, preferably without a volcano! Alas, Maciste goes out in search of water, and the whole tribe is abducted by a horde of men wearing checkered place-mats on their heads! Maciste runs into some enemy stragglers and takes an arrow to the chest. Thankfully, he's built like a heap of firewood, and the arrow does little damage! Maciste / Colossus is soon introduced to the queen of this second bunch, and she's proudly donning a sequined tea-cozy on her noggin. She tells our shirt-shunning hero about a tribe of headhunters that's been giving her trouble. Masciste / Colossus takes his tribe and leaves! The napkin-domed headhunters attack, taking the place-mat people by surprise! Oh Colossus! Where art thou?! Well, by the time he returns, the massacre is complete, the tea-cozy-wearing queen captured! Can big C rescue her, and rid the world of these nefarious savages? Have no fear! There are many opportunities for him to flex and crush things! How could anyone ever tire of watching grown men throw each other around? Make sure you don't miss the odd, somewhat disturbing, wedding dance, by a woman in some sort of tutu! And yes, saints be praised, there are bongo drums! This is transcendent entertainment, folks!...",1498694400,,1613,4.9338235294117645
8221709,1,B000W90JJQ,Really bad. I mean REALLY BAD! And not nearly as entertaining as an Ed Wood film. Grab a box of wine and a Costco sized bag of cheesy-poofs and it could be... No...its just bad. No matter what you do.,1468627200,,200,4.025

8221712,4,B000W90JJQ,"This was an interesting movie. I didn't expect much going into it, but I actually enjoyed this one. The characters were big and bold and the bad guys were bad guys, but the main character was entertaining and his supporting cast all played a good role in the storyline, However, still not a gran scale epic event, but fun to watch..really.",1440374400,2,339,4.573770491803279
8221713,3,B000W90JJQ,"let's face facts we know what we are going to get when we watch these old 1960's sword and sandal epics. So having said that as far as these types of movies go, this wasn't terrible or great either, it simply was. I think that Kirk Morris who plays Colossus is one of the better of the old time Muscle men. He had a really fine physique and actually had some small acting ability. the print wasn't bad either.",1424995200,3,409,4.189873417721519

8221716,5,B000W90JJQ,"You may wonder how can this guy give an obviously B-rate movie a 5 star rating...its simple I factor in budget & then decide if they succeeded in entertaining with a limited budget. This movie is a fun Sword & Sandal period piece, that was well written & the acting was good enough not to take anything away from the story line. Ship wreaked hero's survive with the remnants of a culture who's island sank out from under them only to reach a different island suffering from political instability. The main hero makes a very sensible decision not to help fearing he would endanger the people under his care. As Hollywood would have it he is basically forced to help save the day and put the morally stable people back in charge. If you can enjoy a little escapist fantasy this movie is for you. If your a displaced movie critic only interested in Oscar worthy material then you may want to pass. Not being familiar with Kirk Morris I was pleasantly surprised as the tall fellow with a body builders physic did a more than adequate job acting in this fantasy adventure from the Sword & Sandal genre.",1378598400,3,1097,4.517587939698492
8221717,3,B000W90JJQ,"The film involves a mythological hero-type (Colossus), much like Hercules, who saves a group of citizens when their primitive island sinks into the sea after a series of volcanic eruptions, landslides and earthquake.
They set sail on a raft and face perils at the hands of a brutal bunch in some other far away land.
I really like this film. It has a ""prehistoric"" feel to it much of the time.
Kirk Morris is good as the hero and there are many attractive ladies as well.
I purchased this DVD hoping that the presentation would surpass my old Sinister Cinema version but, unfortunately, such is not the case.
The picture quality is very soft.
If you have never seen the film but like this sort of adventure, it is well worth buying.
It is an excellent escape from the modern-day, politically-correct, dullard 21st Century.
(I'd give the film and story 5 stars.)",1201910400,5,861,4.671052631578948
