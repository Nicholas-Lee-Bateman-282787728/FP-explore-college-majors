7919473,4,B00003TKXL,"In Polish With English Subtitles, although the subtitles are occasionally misspelled and mistranslated, which was funny in itself and added to the comedic value of the movie.  Interesting comedic view of village and farm life in Poland.  The preparations and machinations for the wild boar hunt were as funny as the hunt itself, considering that there weren't actually any real wild boars available for hunting - improvisation is king!  The ""war"" between the small private farms and the massive state-owned farm was both interesting and amusing as well.

Recommended for anyone interested in Polish comedy and/or a view of country life in Poland.",1270771200,,646,5.242718446601942
7919474,4,B00003TKXL,"The story is funny, and the movie is well-directed.  They drive funny little cars, and you get good views of the house interiors. The English translation is OK - now and then a wrong word that would pass a spell check on a computer. But nothing you can't figure out right away.  The only thing I had a little trouble with was the timing of the subtitles, and maybe there could have been a few more.  At times there would be a lot of dialog I was dying to hear (see) without any subtitling, followed by a couple subtitles in such quick succession I couldn't read fast enough.  (I'm a very fast reader!) On the whole, I enjoyed it, and plan to get  more films from this cast/director.",1010620800,,682,4.296875
