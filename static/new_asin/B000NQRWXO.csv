8180957,5,B000NQRWXO,"This is a very helpful material, i've been working on max for almost 4 years, and I like the Lighting area a lot, have bought a book by Darren Brooker that is intended as an introduction to the various ways you could light up a scene.

This DVD focuses more on a production workflow, it goes a little in depth on the various types of lighting rigs, their pro and cons, but one thing that i liked the most is where Tim introduces composition workflow to avoid re-rendering in early stages, he explains in not much depth the advantages of rendering in 32 bit depths (floating point)
So if you have a little knowledge on lighting and want to learn on how to achieve better results and learn a little bit on composition, this is a good tutorial.

Also Tim works with V-ray and Fusion.",1247788800,,780,4.372413793103449
