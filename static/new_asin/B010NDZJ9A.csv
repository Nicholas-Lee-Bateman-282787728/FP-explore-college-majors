7314344,1,B010NDZJ9A,"In response to an email I found in my spam box, I pursued a theological certification to minister from an online course. Upon graduation from printing up my degree from a PDF file, I sought gainful employment that would enable me to utilize my new authority to preach. As I received a deliverance to my faith, I was fortunate enough to find a job as a chaplain for the local Christian homeschooling network of special needs children ages four to thirteen here in Tennessee. It has been essential for me to find new ways of staying contemporary so that I can effectively reach out to the youth I teaching them tried and true principles. Object lessons from our field trips have proven to be most effective teaching tools.
Recently, I loaded up I all thirty kids on the short bus (all the school can afford is a 15 passenger van so we have to squeeze in) and took them to see the movie 'The Nut Job.' Once again Hollywood has packaged a seemingly innocent kids movie glorifying the ills of modern society. Beautiful animation, endearing characters (in this case it is the little animals) clever banter, memorable music and convincingly well-intended purpose all serve as a vehicle to lure and re-educate impressionable minds.
Knowing full-well the intent of this movie, I took advantage of it by counteracting it on our field trip. Sure, people will debate on twitter or chatrooms of the Robin Hood approach to steal from the rich to feed the poor or somehow,the have nots are more entitled to take from the haves. ""Spread the wealth"" as a not so great man once said that I regretfully voted for twice, but stealing is stealing and it is something that should not be embraced. The wording may change, but the definition will remain the same.
After the movie ended, everyone was pretty excited by recalling what everyone had just seen like no one else saw it, we went down to the park. There, I lead them to a secluded area where we gathered about to hear my sermon on stealing. As I reasoned (the only way to guide the weak-minded into thinking your way) with them the follies of sin, more especially in this case, stealing. They began to see the willfully erroneous actions of the animals from the movie.
Despite how hungry the animals were, stealing was still as sin. The children began to be angry with the animals for stealing from the humans who were merely trying to make an honest living and feed their families.
From a footlocker I had just hours before the movie hidden in the bushes, I opened it to reveal an ensemble of various weapons ranging from slingshots, blow darts, BB guns, smoke canisters, one flash bang grenade (not sure how that got in there, but it was hilarious in use) to tasers. Each of the children were encouraged to take one or two of the weapons, find all the animals they could find in the park and serve the justice of their god upon them.
Never before had I felt so much joy than I did for those few hours I the park that day. It is true when they say that 'there is no greater calling than that of teaching.'
I purchased this movie to utilize on more 'teaching' trips for my ministry. It's one star rating is aptly earned due to the deceitful subject matter.",1392508800,6,3191,4.53206239168111
7314345,5,B010NDZJ9A,"The Nut Job may not be an epic masterpiece, but it's a load of fun! Featuring top-notch voice acting by Will Arnett (Arrested Development, Despicable Me, Up All Night, The Millers), Brendan Fraser (Encino Man, The Mummy, Furry Vengeance, Looney Tunes: Back In Action), Katherine Heigl (Grey's Anatomy), and Liam Neeson (The Chronicles Of Narnia), it's a fun-filled escape from the trials and tribulations of daily life! The animation is fantastic, and it even has a couple of heartwarming, tearjerking moments as well. The Nut Job might not be in the same league as films from major CG studios like Pixar, DreamWorks, and Blue Sky, but it still holds up as a fantastic movie! Glad to hear there's a sequel already planned, and there's supposedly a T.V. series in the works (that may have been scrapped, but hopefully it's still in the works). Go see it, you will not regret it!",1391904000,6,877,4.814569536423841
7314346,5,B010NDZJ9A,I saw the movie with my daughter's school.  Pre-K through 2nd grade.  They all loved the slapstick comedy.  I could see my 7 year old watching this over and over.,1391385600,8,162,4.333333333333333
7314347,1,B010NDZJ9A,"Unfortunately, for those of us that enjoy watching animated movies either for our own entertainment or with our kids, not every new feature is going to be as well received as Disneys Frozen.  To that end, whichever animated film was going to be released after Disneys latest box office success was bound to find itself on the proverbial short end of the stick (when comparing the two films).  And here we are as Open Road Films, the distributor behind such films as End of Watch, Machete Kills, and Justin Biebers Believe, has decided to dabble in the animation pool  backing the release of 2014s first animated film, The Nut Job.

Canadian animation director Peter Lepeniotis writes and directs his original story (based on his character from Surly Squirrel), The Nut Job.  Surly (Will Arnett) is an openly selfish squirrel that only looks out of his own interests  most importantly of which is food.  He is a member of a broader group of animals, led by a large raccoon  named Raccoon (Liam Neeson).  With winter approaching and their food supply dwindling down, Raccoon sends two of his most trusted squirrels, Andie (Katherine Heigl) and Grayson (Brendan Fraser) to retrieve nuts from a new nut stand.  Surly has a similar plan, but he only intention is to collect enough nuts for himself  with the help of his silent rat sidekick, Buddy.

Naturally, the plan goes astray for both Surly and his fellow group of animals when a grumpy child randomly approaches the nut vendor for some nuts.  As it turns out, the nut vendor is nothing more than a common bank robber that has been casing the bank across the street.  Mischief ensues and the nut cart eventually managers to do far more damage to Surly and the animals home  prompting Raccoon to banish Surly from his home.  Now, homeless and forced to live in the scary city, Surly stumbles upon a nut storefront and devises a plan  with the help of Buddy and Andie, to steal and share the near endless supply of food.

The Nut Job is a below average animated feature and the best way to describe the direction of the plot would be lazy.  Its storyline is easily foreseeable since (from the opening moments) the major predicament is blatantly evident, and features an outcome that everyone will already be expecting.  On that merit alone, theres absolutely nothing special about what this particular film has to offer.  There are sub-par releases, like The Wild or Home on the Range, that have much more enjoyable characters, so I feel like this film should have done more than just introduce a rude squirrel, his mute sidekick (that looks like hes straight out of Pixars 2007 acclaimed hit, Ratatouille) and a abruptly chatty dog.  The bank heist paralleling the nut heist is cute, but its anything other than a fresh idea.

Surly, the films main character  is a problematic individual from several different points of view.  For starters, hes too self-centered for far too much of the film.  In essence, it takes too long for him to become humbled.  Obviously, his ultimate change in attitude is also a central point of the story, so we all know his inevitable sacrifice is going to be for the greater good of his peers.  In this case, his about-face needed to take effect long before the climax of the film.  No matter how many times people tell him hes selfish, he openly admits that hes perfectly okay with that position.  Its almost like this character tries to make defiance cool  yet the constant defiance creates for a barely likeable protagonist and devastates the characters chemistry with his fellow animals.

Will Arnett, who voices Surly, is the definitely the wrong person to be behind the protagonist.  His voice is too deep and borderline creepy  meaning he would have been much more acceptable as Raccoon, who becomes quite the unlikable character himself.  Still, Liam Neeson was the man behind that voice and I won't dare say anything bad about the guy that played Qui-Gon Jinn (although he has had plenty of lackluster roles over the years).  In any event, Arnetts domineering vocals are standoffish and just don't work for a main character that should be beloved by viewers.

Overall, many people are far too harsh on animated films  but The Nut Job deserves the criticism.  At the end of the day though, the only question most people are really interested in is:  will it entertain kids?  And, even though this plot is old and has been recycled more times than anyone is able to count, it will still hold childrens attentions for the duration.  The characters are anything but memorable, and several of them try to be funny at the wrong moments, but the kids will likely chuckle a time or two.  Animated films are generally moneymaking machines, and The Nut Job will likely do well enough to secure a sequel  even though it already feels more like a direct-to-video endeavor.

7314348,3,B010NDZJ9A,"Yes I know the main characters are unlikeable and it's SO forgettable . But The Nut Job has some fantastic voice acting by Will Arnett and Liam Neeson and it offers a surprisingly clever story and a lot of good animation.

7314349,2,B010NDZJ9A,"My husband and I chose to go to the movies for our ten year wedding anniversary and decided on this movie. There were pros and cons to The Nut Job film that made me feel compelled to only rate it two stars. First the good points to this film:
The pros: The Nut Job contains a positive message of the happy benefits of sharing and the happiness that can occur when achieving goals as a group.
The cons: the film shows the character of Surly being banished from his group for reasons that I personally felt were not necessarily a big deal to isolate someone from a village of other animals. Additionally, the film pretty much centers around one main goal. The film could have been made stronger with the plot of the animal community working together to accomplish three to four goals instead of just one.
As a consolation to me, my husband at least liked this film more than I did.  It is just that I honestly feel that the Nut Job is a film better suited to watching once it is out on dvd rather than seeing it in the movie theaters.  It was not easy for me to rate this movie only two stars because I normally enjoy animated films and have watched and enjoyed many such as the following films: Cloudy With A Chance of Meatballs 2, Despicable Me 2, Hoodwinked, Gnomeo & Juliet, Meet The Robinsons, Tangled,Toy Story 3, Puss In Boots, Hotel Transylvania, and Rango.",1390608000,3,1363,4.404761904761905

7314362,2,B010NDZJ9A,"I was immediately put off by the main character Surly (Will Arnett), a nasty, greedy, selfish squirrel who even abuses his lifelong best friend Buddy, a rat of few words.  Surlys mission in life is to take care of himself first, tough luck to everyone else.  This includes a park full of animals requiring food that Surly is reluctant to share.  When Surly burns up the tree where the animals store their food, they banish him from the park.  I don't need anybody!  He meets a gang of rats and a bunch of crooks planning a bank heist.  On the plus side, the crooks have a lot of nuts that Surly isn't willing to share with anyone.  Did I mention that Surly is extremely nasty?

The cover art on this DVD is deceiving.  It tries to make Surly the squirrel appear cute, as though hes offering you a cashew.  Well, hes not.

I was surprised at how unpleasant this movie was in most respects.  I only found a couple of moments which provided a few chuckles.  Otherwise, a serious lack of imagination went into the story, the characters, and the lackluster animation.",1520899200,,1062,4.46875

7314376,3,B010NDZJ9A,"Nut Job is a bit darker than normal plot wise than your average kids film, not that that's necessarily a bad thing, but just something some people might like to know.  It has okay 3D style animation, but isn't in the same league as most stuff made by the big studios since Toy Story.  The orange girl squirrel looks a but underdrawn or undetailed for example.  But the movie is definitely watchable.

Basic plot revolves around a squirrel who has pretty much been ostracised by the other animals in a city park who is planning a scheme to get enough nuts for himself and his only friend a rat (a species not liked by the other park animals) to survive winter.  His target a hot dog mobile stand type nut vendor who unbeknownst to the squirrel is a bank robber scouting out a bank across the road. Also unbeknownst to the squirrel, the other animals in the park have sent a the poorly drawn girl squirrel and an up-himself squirrel to raid the same nut stand.  Of course the villains annoy a little girl who brings the police, which upsets the plans of both criminal enterprise squirrels and to end a long story short results in the other animals losing their already gathered supplies and the loner squirrel being banished from the park and forced to live in the city.  The squirrel while avoiding death from some street rats stumbles upon the hideout of the human criminals, a nut processing factory, and decides to rob it. The same girl and upitself squirrel have also been sent to the city to find food for winter, and of course the two cross paths.  Can they team up while avoiding the human bad guys as well as some animal ones?",1515542400,,1633,4.474747474747475

7314454,3,B010NDZJ9A,"CG film is big, big business. One need only look at the type of profits Pixar and DreamWorks can knock down with a single successful film to recognize the near limitless potential on tap here.  Trouble is there are only a few major studios with the budget-backing and distribution clout to turn every CG film out there into the next Shrek or Toy Story.

For the most part independent and modest-budgeted CG pieces generate very small blips on the global radar; brief theatrical runs (if any) and most of the budget-recovering coming in the form of video releases and Netflix licensing.

The Nut Job is one of very few films out there determined to navigate the cracks between an independently produced film and a major theatrical release.  Somehow, against all odds, the formula paid dividends.  This isn't to say the viewing experience is without flaw of course, but from a financial stand point, The Nut Job proves the deep pockets of Disney aren't always required to make a splash in the CG animation pond.

So how exactly did the project come to be?  Produced by Gulfstream Pictures, Redrover International and ToonBox Entertainment, it was ultimately released in the United States in January of 2014 by Open Road Films.  If this sounds like a lot of hands in the cookie jar, it certainly is.  But thats because production was split between the US with animation duties performed in South Korea.  All told the budget comes in at $42.8-million; a fraction of what Pixar usually spends ($200-million) on its feature length CG films of late but over double what LionsGate invested to make the first Alpha and Omega ($20-million).

Even at $42.8 million, it bears the distinction of being the most expensive animated film co-produced in South Korea to date.  If that sounds like an awful lot of coin to drop on a CG piece, take comfort.  In the end it would gross $64.3 million in North America alone with a worldwide total coming in at $120.9-million.  That kind of return is an investors dream and it comes as no surprise then that the sequel, titled The Nut Job 2: Nutty by Nature, is scheduled to be released on August 18, 2017 theatrically.

So whats the film all about?  Well its certainly nothing new under the CG sun; anthropomorphic critters hustling to prepare for the winter while being functioning members of a society all their own.  Weve seen it before countless times, whether from the likes of Ratatouille, the Open Seasons or perhaps most similarly- DreamWorks Over the Hedge.

In this case we follow along the aptly named Surly the Squirrel (Will Arnett) and his mostly-mute sidekick, a rat called Buddy who ends up getting himself banished from the park by his peers  led by an authoritative Raccoon (Liam Neeson).  The name of the game is food gathering and, though banished, Surly continues to find himself in situations that demand he think only of himself, the park animals that banished him but rarely both.  Fellow squirrel Andie (Katherine Heigl) appears in his exploits several times to further solidify his ultimatum while reiterating the central conflict of the film for viewers who may start to think its possible to have ones cake and eat it too in a city full of nuts.

The pacing is decent and the plentiful gags tolerable throughout though viewers expecting the type of slick storytelling of Pixar or the layered humor of DreamWorks will certainly find the experience pretty flat.  Nearly all of the humor here is of the visual, slapstick variety and sadly it feels as though the writers missed many opportunities for genuine cleverness in favor of more straight-forward & lackluster narrative.

Many critics complain that the material is simply too thin to be spread out across an 86-minute run-time and indeed, the story itself does seem to drift to the back-burner so as to allow visual silliness the spotlight.  Some light attempts at character development do pay off decently by the end, though.

Perhaps the films most ambitious achievement, however, is integrating two parallel stories atop one another- the heist being pulled off by human gangsters in psuedo-1950s noir style and the simultaneous heist the animals are attempting to pull on the gangsters.  Like most aspects of this piece, a bit more effort and creativity could have made this progression brilliant but as it stands, its simply another element that neither offends nor shines.

All in all The Nut Job is a fairly harmless and enjoyable visual romp for audiences of all ages that neither takes any chances nor fails remarkably as a result.  Rather it plods along with simplistic narrative and a heavy dose of action sequences.  Its greatest achievement by far is the success it managed given the lack of major studio support.  It will be interesting to witness how they approach things in the forthcoming sequel.",1486771200,,4820,4.884520884520884

7314530,3,B010NDZJ9A,"Will Arnett made his voice famous when he put on the mock animus of Batman in the animated The Lego Movie.  Prior to that fine film he put on the voice of Surly the self-centered squirrel in The Nut Job which is a kid-friendly animated movie that so desperately wants not to be lame but justcantmanageto escape.its gummy (I resisted saying nutty) sentiment.  You see, Surly is a squirrel whos always looking how to get that next big food score and he doesnt play nice with others in the park.  He certainly doesnt trust Raccoon (voiced by the ever-gruff Liam Neeson) and his altruistic but controlling ways of gathering and dispersing the food.  So when Surly strikes out on his own and inevitably causes more trouble than hes worth hes banished from the park.  Followed by his faithful rat buddynamed Buddywho doesnt talk and is often disregarded by Surly the two enter the land of commercial real estate right across the street and find a literal storehouse of nuts!  How convenient.  Whats not so convenient is that there a bunch of mobsters using the cleaned out store as a.you know what?  Who cares.  Youve seen this story already and know how its going to end.  And Im being too harsh on this movie.  Its decent for the kiddies, which are its target audience, but with so many animated movies being delightful for adults too this one ends up falling far short on that account.  It tries so hard to set up for escaping its own sentimentality and yet falls right into it at the end.  Why couldn't the raccoon have been an actual good guy?  Or that red Breshnev cardinal bird (him I liked)?  Whyd they have to be bad?  Why is it that the self-centered Surly learns his lesson and accidentally ends up being the good guy?  Why cant a kids movie show an egoist squirrel as someone whom you wouldnt want to model yourself after?  In short, why cant it be more clever and true to life?  Im seriously asking here.  So many of the messages of kids films aren't just about redemption or doing something bad and finding forgiveness (great messages to be sure) but they hold onto an inherent distrust of the people in charge.  Now that can certainly be healthy up to a point as a young adult on up but as a child?  Do you want your kids to distrust you?  Not everyone whos in charge is a bad guy.  Anyway, Id give this film bonus points for the character Precious the Pug as I love Pugs but Precious (voiced by Maya Rudolph) is rather annoying.  And so this film has kind of annoyed me as you can probably tell.  So there you go.",1438992000,2,2523,4.430434782608696

7314542,1,B010NDZJ9A,"This was really disappointing. The animation seemed sub-par and unoriginal (and why does it seem like there's always a skinny, neurotic rat character in so many of these animal-themed CGI films). The villians were strikingly unoriginal and looked like extra's from the ""Team Fortress"" video game. The story was completely predictable and the writing seemed really stilted and even difficult to follow, especially the gray squirrel whose character name I can't recall, but the character was so forgettable and written in and out of the story so inconsistently its no wonder. There was really nothing redeeming about this film. The young kids had a couple laughs but for the most part the film was just boring.",1433894400,,708,5.112068965517241

7314586,1,B010NDZJ9A,"This movie is nothing more than a blatant ripoff of Over the Hedge, the story is very similar to Over the Hedge a selfish squirrel Surly  accidently destroys all of the parks food supply just like a certain  racoon we all know he gets banished and finds a nut store being used as a hideout by a group of mobsters unfortunately the other park animals find out about it and Surly is forced to help them gather the nuts for the park while this whole mess is going on a mob boss recently released from prison who looks and sounds like Robert DeNero is using the store along with his crew to rob the bank next door and that's pretty much the whole movie.",1424736000,2,649,4.225806451612903
7314587,2,B010NDZJ9A,"The Nut Job looks great. Maybe this is not as great as Pixars, but the animation is visually attractive, and the animators all did a pretty good job. But the same cannot be said about the story and characters.

The central character, it seems, is a self-centered squirrel named Surly. Surly wants to live alone (actually, he has a sort of partner, a rat named Buddy), but because of a terrible accident, he is banished from the park where other creatures are living. And all these creatures want nuts (do moles eat nuts? I don't know) because the winter is coming and they have no food.

But there is Maury's Nut Shop in the city, Surly discovers, and there are tons of nuts there. Surly is overjoyed but what he does not know is that the shop is in fact a hideout for the gangsters (oh, and they are humans).

Well, the story does not sound very interesting. And it is not interesting, partly because Peter Lepeniotis The Nut Job is based on an 11-minute short titled Surly Squirrel made in 2005 by the same director. The story that is stretched for the feature film is muddled and doesnt make sense, but what is really terrible is characters. Few of them are likable or amusing, but most are simply irritating. Jokes are largely slapstick, which is fine with me, but they are not very funny.

Kids might find the film differently. I don't know. But why should they see this when there are much better films?",1424736000,,1409,4.4921875

7314591,4,B010NDZJ9A,"The only famous name that I saw from this movie is Liam Neeson. Other than him, I wouldn't be able to recognise any other actor or actresses. To my surprise, this was a pleasantly good movie, filled with the universal theme of trust and betrayal.

The flamboyant cast of characters ranging from squirrels to racoons to otters to rats will definitely resonate with kids, thus making this an enjoyable and memorable experience that the family can watch together.

With regard to the organisation of the plot, it ties in with a dual plot of the humans who are attempting a unique bank robbery while the motley crew of furry creatures inevitably save the day by ruining and exposing their dubious scheme.

Also, watch out for the ever-popular Gangnam Style theme song that is played during the movie and set to throw you out of your seats as your wriggle with laughter. The credits are somehow an ode to Psy who is portrayed in cartoon form.",1424390400,,937,4.666666666666667

7314776,4,B010NDZJ9A,"The animals in Liberty Park don't have enough food to carry them through the winter. Surly Squirrel doesn't care about the others; he's looking out for number one. He has his eye on a nut cart, but when that doesn't work out, circumstances lead him to another opportunity to fill his belly.

I liked Surly. Buddy was my favorite. Some of the humans reminded me of characters in a classic gangster movie - their look, but mostly their way of speaking - and that tickled me. Even though Raccoon wasn't likable, he had my undivided attention because I like Liam Neeson's voice.

I love to see animated cities that look so close to real. The buildings, bridge, moving vehicles, colorful trees, waterfalls and even pipes and the garden hose were well done. I guess the little red haired girl was supposed to add humor, but I thought she was irritating. But there were parts that made me laugh. And I loved the vibrant colors.

The Nut Job (PG) is an entertaining computer animated film with lessons on trust and friendship.",1408060800,,1018,4.644444444444445

The Nut Job, unfortunately, was not one of those movies.  It was filled with bad puns, poor voice acting (and casting choices), and some displays of behavior that wouldn't really be appropriate for kids.  (Main characters who start out acting like jerks, pushing other characters around, then getting into good graces with others later on while still acting like that.  Do we really want kids to think you can be a jerk, and people will still like them?)

All in all, this movie was pretty poor.  It had some potential, but just really fell flat.  I wouldn't see it again.",1405814400,,699,4.580645161290323

7314903,2,B010NDZJ9A,"Will Arnett, Brendan Fraser, Gabriel Iglesias, Jeff Dunham, Maya Rudolph, Liam Neeson, Stephan Lang and Katherine Heigl provide some of the voices for The Nut Job, an animated film that has, for its characters, an assortment of rodents and human mobsters, all fighting over a supply of nuts during a shortage.

The little ones might be entranced by the bug-eyed critters and pretty colors (though I wouldnt count on it), but a weak, humorless and confused script, along with indifferent animation, makes it an uninteresting affair for viewers over the age of, say, seven-and-a-half.

Nut Job has some quality actors including Arnett and Liam Nielson and do an ok job with their respective voice roles. The movie is loaded with action with almost dual storylines with humans and the animals. For me, the movie is a bit of a letdown with its humor and is not quite as funny as I expected it to be. Although kids will probably find this more amusing and fun to watch than adults. As an action cartoon then this does an ok job as a funny cartoon less so.

An average watch but there are other animations out there that work better for both adults and kids. This one I found to be better for the kids and less so for us adults.",1401840000,,763,4.114093959731544

7314993,1,B010NDZJ9A,"1. Character clichs - cute squirrel love interest, narcissistic squirrel, sidekick rat (goofy, but comes through at crucial moments), lots of animals working together to collect winter food. The usual bad rats and other animal baddies and bad humans as foils. Nothing creative in the animal/human expressions - bland and predictable.
2. Stereotypic storyline - outcast animal comes through in the end to save fellow animals from bad humans and bad animals.
3. Graphics were cheap - e.g. a 2D tree with no moving leaves; now extend that thought to all the background graphics for the whole movie.
4. Choosing name actors to do the voices usually doesn't work with animations. Voices didn't fit the characters and sounded rehearsed. The dumbed down dialogue didn't help. Professionally trained voice overs are usually better at bringing life to animations.
5. Some parts of the story made no sense weird e.g. the dog whistle and the Gangnam Style animation at the end (maybe payback to the Korean investors and animators).",1400889600,5,1020,5.11377245508982

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE NUT JOB is an awesome 3D animated film for all age groups. It has a lot of star power behind its animated characters with Will Arnett, Brendan Fraser, Gabriel Iglesias, Jeff Dunham, Liam Neeson, and Katherine Heigl offering their voices to the awesome 3D animation film. It has been released by Universal Studios and is a decently fun family outing that will particularly please younger children in the audience and offer up mild entertainment to anyone who is a little bit older.

The story primarily revolves around Surly [Will Arnett], who is a bit of a mischievous squirrel. Unlike the rest of the squirrels living in the park, he's gained a reputation for taking nuts solely for himself. He doesn't play that well with others and his sole friend is a rat who doesn't speak but is always by his side. Early in the film, he is confronted by Andie [Katherine Heigl], who attempts to inspire in him a need to help the community of the park and to share his nuts with other animals in need of food. Surly doesn't react to this with much thought and is keen only on keeping the nuts for himself.

After a long(ish) action sequence, it isn't long before a fire accident destroys the food that the park had saved and managed to have for the upcoming season. The finger is pointed towards Surly and the manager of the park, the formidable Raccoon [Liam Neeson] suggests that the community banish Surly from living with them.

Meanwhile, a meeting is held at the park. It is decided that someone needs to go out and look for food for the other animals because of their lack of available options following the loss of their stock. Andie leads the team along with Grayson [Brendan Fraser], who is at first a wannabe heroic leader before actually becoming one before the movie's end. The pair set out to find possible food options and they soon come to the same nut shop.

Underneath the main plot-line, there is also a somewhat generic and boring sub-plot involving gangsters attempting to rob a bank who are using the nut shop as their front to robbing. This storyline is far less interesting than the main one involving the squirrels, but the storyline is something that gives attention to both plots as an element of the animation film, but with much less screen time devoted to the gangsters.

The 3D animation in the film is something that one would expect to be one of the high points considering the $40 million production budget. The Nut Job is something one would want to deliver as good of an animated presentation as possible within that kind of framework. It's disappointing that while the whole film has a clean and vibrant colour palette the artistry is less detailed and more generic feeling. There are some nice elements to the artwork. However, nothing in the production design comes close to the work done by major animation studios like PIXAR (the best of the best), Sony Pictures Animation or DreamWorks Animation. I thought this film was a solid decent done animation film that is charming, sweet, and totally good-natured. The plot-line almost feels like a throwback to cartoons of the 70's or 80's (which is sort of nice). The Nut Job has big screen joyous aspiration with a first rate video presentation, with a totally solid 3D awesome experience and an equally amazing 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio Surround Track.

3D Blu-ray Video Quality  THE NUT JOB is presented on 3D Blu-ray with an impressive 1080p High Definition transfer that retains the film's original 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio. The animation looks as stunning as it ever will with a good clean presentation that provides the artwork with all the detail and clarity one expects from a solid digital animation transfer. But the best of this is of course the 3D Blu-ray disc, which is totally stunning, but of course the choice is totally up to you, especially having both 3D and 2D discs, but I will always watch the 3D Blu-ray disc, as it gives you so much more depth of clarity and involves you so much more with the brilliant cute animal characters.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  THE NUT JOB is presented with an amazing 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio presentation, and more than gets the job done, sinking its teeth into the more action-oriented sequences with ease. Output is big and bold when the nut cart hurtle down the street and around the park; explosions rip through concrete, or giant-footed robbers give chase to scampering rodents, even if it isn't all that remarkable beyond Surly's antics and the central heist. And the rear speakers are spry and playful, delivering ample ambience in Raccoon's park and the busy streets of downtown. Directionality is decent and pans are smooth, without anything in the way of major problems. Voices are clean, clear and intelligible too, although never really as grounded in the soundscape as they should be. Too many lines seem a tad detached from the rest of the sound field. That said, the film's sound design is the culprit, nothing more. Will The Nut Job's lossless track sweep you up into the wild hijinks of Surly the Squirrel? No. It will not disappoint you, and will blow you away! With the Blu-ray Special Features and Extras, these are presented in 2.0 Dolby Digital Stereo.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extra:

Special Feature: Storyboards [2014] [1080p] [3:00] Presents a few short select moments from the film as they were as storyboarded before the sequence was produced. There is no sound.

Special Feature: The Great Nut Heist [2014] [1080p] [2:06] This feature describes the plot of the animation film, sometimes showing the actors voicing their scenes cut next to the scene they are voicing. Everything is narrated by Will Arnett.

Special Feature: Animated Shorts [2014] [1080p] Here we get the biggest inclusion of two animated shorts, and they are:

Surly Squirrel [2005] [10:55] [1080p] Here we meet Surly Squirrel and his Rat friend for the very first time in the award-winning animated short that started it all. A discarded pizza slice becomes the Holy Grail to a pack of starving park animals.  A rat and squirrel launch a clandestine operation to get the slice, without any of the other park animals finding out, but their greed disrupts the natural order of the park once their plan is discovered. Simultaneously, across the street from the park, a bank heist turns into a huge gunfight between bank robbers and police. These two worlds collide in an uproarious farcical romp of comic cartoon mayhem. Voice Cast: Eric Bauza, Joe Giampapa, Shona Glover, Jason Groh, Bruce Hunter and Laura Rodgers. Directed by Peter Lepeniotis. Screenplay by Peter Lepeniotis. Produced by Dan Krech, Jackie Lynette, Marissa Collyer, Pranay Patel and Rob Aitchison. Animations were created by ToonBox Entertainment as a teaser for THE NUT JOB.

Nuts & Robbers [2010] [4:30] [1080p] Lets get Nuts! Robberies don't always have to be planned. In this case, they don't even have to make sense. Follow Micky as he attempts to hold up the wrong shop at the wrong time and in the wrong neighbourhood. 'Nuts and Robbers' is a black-comedy short film from the creative minds of Marty Stalker and Aidan Gault. Voice Cast: Denis Halligan, Larry Cowan and Christopher Paul Heath. Directed by Peter Lepeniotis. Music Department: Andrew Simon McAllister. Animations were created by ToonBox Entertainment as a teaser for THE NUT JOB. Awards: 2011 Animago Awards [Germany] Won: Best Character Design. 2012 3D Film Festival [Los Angeles]: Won: Best Animated Short.

Deleted Scenes [2014] [1080p] [5:00] Presents a few selected moments that were left on the cutting room floor. These are more like mini altered scenes more than they are deleted scenes.

Special Feature: Dance-Off End Credits Sequence [2014] [1080p] [4:00] Surly joins his furry friends and especially a very special guest appearance of Psy for this show-stopping Gangnam Style number, but sadly it is not shown in 3D.

BONUS: This has a beautiful designed 3D printed slip cover.

Finally, the story is more than a bit frantic, and there are no real break-out characters that make an animated film a classic, but THE  NUT JOB is amiable enough to entertain everyone. Whether the adults will be engaged or not depends on how much they like the look of things. And THE NUT JOB is brilliant to look at, from its retro-inspired style to its bright colours and attention to detail and the wise cracks are totally brilliant. Especially impressive are the individual hairs on characters and rendered textures like wood and stone. The look of the film, from the styling of the buildings and backgrounds to the whole heist scenario, brings to mind classic Bugs Bunny encounters with the gangsters Rocky and Mugsy. Alas, none of the characters in THE NUT JOB have quite the personality of A Bug's Life [1998[, but despite this, I really loved this 3D animation film and have already watched it many times, as each time you view it you seem to see something new, as there is so much action happening. But again the 3D Blu-ray disc is totally stunning and despite a lot of negative reviews, I think they must be viewing a totally different 3D Blu-ray disc and all their negative comments are out of order and do not appreciate all the animation work that went into making The Nut Job. But one very important aspect I need to warn you about and that is that you MUST definitely watch the End Credits right to the very end, as you will see some amazing 3D animation and of course you must keep your 3D glasses on right to the bitter end, as it is a joyous exuberant amazing experience and definitely the best 3D Credits I have ever seen in a very long time and I know it will give me many hours of enjoyable entertainment and will amaze your friends and is 3D reference. Another amazing bonus for purchasing the 3D and 2D Blu-ray disc combination is the amazing slip cover, as it has an amazing stunning 3D effect, which is not pointed out from any of the other 3D Blu-ray Reviews I have read. But the most important thing is that I am more than happy to have this in my Blu-ray Collection. Very Highly Recommended!

Having the credits roll to gundam style made no sense to me, however my kids loved it.  One of the shorts is very violent and uses language better suited to a PG-13 audience.

I am glad we just rented it, I would not waste money buying it.",1399852800,,382,4.338028169014085

We thought the squirrel was going to be a funny, silly, wiry little guy. He was not. Most of the movie was dry and boring. The animals had little, or no personalities. And the song at the end playing while the credits rolled, had nothing to do with the movie. They seemed to have just thrown it in so there could be silly (not really), dancing. And there was some little guy with dark glasses and dark hair dancing around? Who in the world was he? Do not waste your money or time if you are looking for a fun animated movie.

7315054,3,B010NDZJ9A,"My daughter had bugged me the entire time this was in the theaters to go and see it but I just wasn't very enthused about it. Anytime I don't really laugh during the previews it's a bad sign. First off, the animation, especially in the first few scenes? WHAT THE HECK? It looked weird and distorted. I can't tell if it got better or my eyes refocused. Either way, the story arc just wasn't all that great. Good guys, supposed bad guy, and the real bad guy. Good wins (which is great for little kids but not realistic) and bad is stuck in the harbor floating.

Bottom line: rent it on here and be glad you didn't pay to see it i the theater. Had I spent $45 bucks on this in the theater (1 adult, 1 kid for matinee/snacks in SC) I would have been ticked off.

I was out 2 cans of soda, a bag of popcorn, and some electricity at home. It's rated three stars because it kept my 9 year old in front of the tv through the entire movie even though she described it as ""mehhh,"" after it was over.

There's a collection of characters, voiced by famous people, and there is a horrible, stupid plot line trying to move the whole thing along.  I kind of thought we were past the point where knowing which stars voiced which characters was a big part of the attraction.  So many animated movies have been made since Shrek wore that idea out.

In my mind they sort of steal innocence without having to pay the going price. Also, I sense that parents who take their kids to movies like these want to be entertained and they use their children as the entrance fee.

I am still confused as to when we forgot to let children movies tell moral stories without snide jokes meant for adults in the room. Oh, I remember, it was when the movie companies remembered that children do not pay for high-priced tickets, adults do!",1398729600,3,598,4.387387387387387

7315117,4,B010NDZJ9A,"Precious the pug, voiced by Maya Rudolph, is a one of many surprising delights in the new animated feature The Nut Job. Its a 1950s heist caper in which squirrels and their friends target the nut shop where Precious is the ineffective guard dog, hilariously recruited as accomplice to the loner hero, Surly (Will Arnett).

Indeed, the movies sidekicks are its funniest bits. Other than Precious, Surlys only friend is an adorably expressive mute rat named Buddy, and the villain, simply called Raccoon (with Liam Neesons growl), has his own voiceless enforcer, a cardinal who turns out to be a very angry bird.

The main characters are more stock. Theres a limp squirrel love triangle with Surly, feisty Andie (Katherine Heigl) and the curiously cracked Grayson (Brendan Fraser) that never really clicks, and the plot  which also involves human gangsters who are using the nut shop as a front to burrow into a bank vault  runs off the rails toward the end. Judging by the 5-to-7-year-olds seated in front of us, whose questions for Mom came rapid fire as the wacky action ramped up, the movie may leave younger children befuddled.

Yet its much better than its RottenTomatoes.com ranking, which I have to assume is a function of January awfulness overload. No, The Nut Job is not Toy Story 4. But both the animation and the story (based on a short by this films writer-director, Peter Lepeniotis, an animator on Toy Story 2 and Dinosaur) are better crafted than, say, overrated Oscar nominee The Croods. It may trip over its many plot threads, but its far from the string of flatulence jokes some reviewers would have you believe.

The 3D aspect is a mixed bag  it adds little  but if you're a fan of underrated animated features like Flushed Away, The Nut Job has joys to offer: Great backgrounds and character design, lively direction, a wealth of laugh-out-loud gags with Road Runner energy  and that pug, who merits mention with such great comic cronies as Bambis Thumper and Toy Storys Rex.

If you're wondering who made The Nut Job, well, so am I. It was funded with $40-million-plus of mostly South Korean money, a fact reflected in a bizarre end-credits sequence that features a CG Psy leading the movies characters in the Gangnam Style dance. Weird and out of place, but definitely, um, nutty.",1398038400,5,2302,4.819796954314721

I mean, certain animated movies you know right away what it's about, but this one is kind of all over the place. All I know is it's about city park squirrels and other wildlife doing what they can to stay fed. But then there's a whole other story about some guys trying to rob a bank that gets mixed in with the squirrels. It's worth watching at least once so that you can form your own opinions. I had hoped for more screen-time interaction between Jeff Dunham and Gabriel Iglesias's characters (I absolutely adore both comedians and was thrilled to hear that they did a movie together!)",1397865600,,660,4.418032786885246

You know what else I love? Humor. I love to laugh! I'm sure you and your family do too. My suggestion? Pleas DON'T watch this movie! Its fine for kids under the age of five, but really you should be a good parent or guardian and show your kid something well written and humorous so they can develop good tastes from an early age. Let me tell you I have had my fill of nut related humor for a LOOOOOOOOOOONG time! You can't even make fun of it with your friends. Trust me, I tried with mine. All you'll do as it plays is carry on your conversation while periodically saying, ""is this movie still on?"" You may have had all kinds of jobs in your lifetime (either performed by you or performed on you), but a Nut Job is something YOU DO NOT WANT. TRUST ME.

I don't see it as a film he will watch over and over, but it was definitely a fun film for him. I chuckled a few times myself.",1396137600,14,363,3.776315789473684
7315141,4,B010NDZJ9A,"Was surprised when I saw this only had 14 reviews and not that great of ones, so I felt the need to give my two cents. Why? Because I never get to go see regular adult movies at the movie theater. I always see kids releases with my kid. I was not sure about this one but I was pleasantly surprised when it was over that I liked it as much as I did.

There is a lot of characters, the focus is not just on the one squirrel. The story sounds simple but gets complicated. It is very colorful and there are laughable moments. The pug is an obvious favorite, Precious is her name. Very cute and fun with no upsetting death and a nice ending. I would recommend this for sure to at least watch by renting. I personally will be buying this one when it comes out.",1394582400,81,754,4.026666666666666
7315142,3,B010NDZJ9A,"Surley (Will Arnett) is a hard working libertarian prepper squirrel. He comes across a big score with a wagon that vends roasted nuts. Andie (Katherine Heigl), the cute liberal squirrel wants Surley to share his find with the group, that haven't been able to save up enough food for the winter in Liberty Park of Oakton.

Through a series of circumstances, the park stash gets destroyed and Surley is blamed. The head coon (Liam Neeson) banishes Surley to the city where our resourceful libertarian discovers a horde of nuts which Andie butts in and wants him to share. He discovers the head coon wants to control the food supply so he can control the masses...or at least the 47% ers. Grayson (Brendan Fraser) is the puffed chest phoney conservative hero who takes credit for the work done by the libertarian. But only by working together can they get rid of the coon in power.

While they are planning an Ocean's Eleven heist of the nuts, the humans are planning a bank robbery.

Great film for the kids so they can tell their teacher they are ""getting a nut"". Also, stealing is good. Let me know how this works out for you.",1394409600,,1126,4.592039800995025

I would not recommend even renting this for anything over $1.00. Free, maybe, but that's pressing it. Sorry, just didn't like it at all, especially given the other good kids/animated movies that came out in 2013/beginning of 2014. Disappointed indeed.

7315145,5,B010NDZJ9A,"The Nut Job is a movie with a huge heart and not enough credit given for it. This film was helmed by storytellers and artists who made many amazing animated movies possible, such as Toy Story 2, and it's clear to see that they know what they're doing when it comes to making a really great movie! It may have been made be a small company, but great things come in small packages. In this story, we find a flawed character in a shaky alliance that is further wrapped up in a crazy situation. And all of this centered on a nut store, of all things :) If you enjoyed Dreamworks' Over The Hedge or Pixar's Ratatouille, you'll find similarities between the two that are hard not to love. Our protagonist, Surly, is expertly played by the great Will Arnett, who delivers a delightfully... well... ""surly"" character with a heart of gold. And his story slowly but surely begins to change him from an ""every rodent for himself"" sort of guy to the definition of a real hero. One of the story points I love most about The Nut Job is in fact that, the definition of a real hero, as he shows that a hero is not necessarily made by heroic stature and good looks, but is one who puts others before himself and does the right thing no matter what. His journey is something that many need to be reminded of in this day and age. The film's humorous moments aren't all over the place, and not all the jokes are laugh-out-loud funny, but the best jokes are right where they need to be. The characters overall are lovable and relatable (even with Surly's occasional ""jerkiness""), who add their own elements of humor, drama, and intrigue to the story. The acting is top-notch and very fun, and the animation is beautiful despite the company's small standings. With an upbeat tune carrying it along, the first feature from Redrover will make anyone smile! It's not your typical animated family film, especially considering its often intense plotline, but if you look deeper than perhaps just first impressions, you will find a truly delightful tale in The Nut Job. I look forward to its sequel and the rest of the company's films with great optimism!",1393459200,5,2127,4.541666666666667

There's a wide range of loveable characters (as well as a few detestable ones), from the selfless to the self-absorbed, from the typical (but refreshing) to the unexpected. And it's not just a squirrel's job. You'll find burly groundhogs, a crafty raccoon, a loyal rat, a quirky dog and more (not to mention a few human characters).

If you're looking for a family film for the evening, your kids will laugh out loud at this one. At the same time, they'll be getting a great lesson about what an ordinary hero looks like.",1533600000,,672,4.638655462184874
