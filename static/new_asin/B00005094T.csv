7928832,4,B00005094T,"Ranma against Shadow Ranma is a great eppie... how would you like YOUR shadow running all over the place?? I thought the animation was pretty well done, but the dubbing... let's surpass shall we? (It's even better in Italian!!!) I didn't particularly like the second episode though. While it if pretty funny, it lacks the smooth plotline that so many great Ranma episodes have.",1071532800,,377,4.90625
