8209820,5,B000TJ6PDI,I first saw this movie on the TCM channel and thought it to be very funny. I recommend the movie for a great time.,1404086400,,114,3.7916666666666665
8209821,3,B000TJ6PDI,"The movie is still as funny  as I  remember  from my days in Oz, where it came out just as I was leaving to spend a few years in Godzone, before moving to the States. It draws heavily on Strine the Australian dialect.  Barry, Bazza to his mates is an innocent Australian nincompoop, visiting England, here pictured as a land mostly filled with degenerates and perverts.  The English are very much in on the joke and there are some prominent English comedians in the film, such as Peter Cook and Spike Milligan. However the transfer to dvd is simply dreadful. Both the picture and sound are very low-fi. Hopefully someone will issue a clean transfer some day.",1389398400,2,658,4.589743589743589
8209822,5,B000TJ6PDI,Bought this for my husband who was an Australian in London at the same time as Bazza.  He loved the gift.  Though I'm not a fan of Dame Edna-I loved the one-eyed trouser snake song sung by Barry!,1270857600,,195,4.105263157894737

8209824,3,B000TJ6PDI,"Early Dame Edna takes her UK-born Australian nephew back to England to merry on a local girl of whose mother arranged this trip on her expense.

Showing the England of the seventies as seen by an Australian-bread lad and lad's behavioral features as seen by local Pomes distinguishes traditionally between Australia and mother country of England by usual made-in-Australia way.

Perhaps, Crocodile Dundee in the States ( see, for instance,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crocodile-Dundee-Triple-Feature/dp/B000QUEQ6S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crocodile Dundee Triple Feature</a>&nbsp;)is the further much better developments of this topic on one nation's diversification upon a passage of time occurred.",1191369600,4,756,6.947368421052632
