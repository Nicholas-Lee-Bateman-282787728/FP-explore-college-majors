the next release was David Gilmore's on an island CD 2007  and live CD.

The band is clearly a tribute band ""Australian Pink Floyd Show""
Pink Floyd has not been on tour except with Gilmore in 2007 - 2009 and that only included rick wright (me he rest in piece). this was the last time.

Rodger does not use the floyd name, so who could it be? LEARN YOU BANDS PEOPLE",1415318400,,473,4.175824175824176

8516894,1,B007HTPZ48,Anyone shipping bluray discs around the world know that they will only play in certain regions.  This shipper sent me a bluray at the steep price of over $50 that would not play in my region of the world.  I really wanted to enjoy this show but was extremely disappointed when i loaded the disc and received a screen message that it will not play in my region of the world.  There was no mystery - I GAVE THEM MY SHIPPING ADDRESS!  They wanted the sale but did not care if it worked.  I do have to say that Amazon was great in giving me a refund.,1388448000,10,546,4.065420560747664
