522622,4,6302877873,"The recently released DVD of There Was a Crooked Man should be a must-have for fans of its stars Kirk Douglas and Henry Fonda.  Not many movie fans know about this movie, but hopefully this DVD release will spark some conversation.  Paris Pitman Jr is a likable outlaw who robs $500,000 from a rich businessman, but unfortunately is later caught at the local brothel by the same man after he has already hidden the loot.  Pitman is sent to the territorial prison where he recruits his fellow inmates to help him escape for a share of the money.  But during his stay, a new warden, Woodrow Lopeman, comes along who wants to rehabilitate and reform these prisoners, using Pitman as his prime example.  This western has just the right blend of humor and action.  Much of the humor is pretty low-brow, but still funny, and the action is saved for the last half hour.  With a quirky musical score, including the theme sung by Trini Lopez, and a great cast, don't let this little known western pass you by.

  As affable outlaw Paris Pitman JR, star Kirk Douglas gives one of his finest comedic roles from his career.  Pitman can talk his way out of any situation, and Douglas pulls off the part perfectly.  It's not until the last 20 minutes though that you realize how ruthless he can be in pursuit of his money.  Henry Fonda is also very good as Woodrow Lopeman, the warden with a limp who tries to reform the prisoners.  Fonda is underused so you don't know much about his background, but what's there is good.  Pitman's inmates is a list of great character actors headed by Hume Cronyn and John Randolph as Dudley and Cyrus, an old gay couple who pull off con jobs, Warren Oates as Floyd Moon, a notorious outlaw who believes he has found a friend in Pitman, Burgess Meredith in a great part as the Missouri Kid, a famous train robber who's been in prison 35 years, Michael Blodgett as Coy Cavendish, the young man guilty of murder trying to prove himself, and C.K. Yang as Ah-Ping, the silent ""Chinaman.""  Alan Hale and Victor French play Tobaccy and Whiskey, two of the prison guards.

  The new DVD is very well put together.  It features the movie in a beautiful looking widescreen presentation (I didn't see a scratch till the movie's final minute), a theatrical trailer, and a 10-minute making of featurette made during filming with Michael Blodgett as the narrator.  Don't watch the trailer or making of featurette before you see the movie because it gives away some important plot points.  The featurette also introduces Warren Oates as John Randolph!  Maybe they couldn't find a shot of Randolph, who knows.  Regardless, this is a very funny and off-beat western with a great cast headed by Douglas and Fonda so don't miss There Was a Crooked Man!",1167177600,6,2755,4.621399176954733
522623,4,6302877873,"In making ""There Was a Crooked Man"" Joseph L. Mankiewicz set out with the intention of creating a cynical Western, based on the view that there is a little bit of badness even in the best of men... What emerges in this long and expert exercise is a film so thorough1y cynical, so negative in its view of the human species that the viewer is allowed no point of view of his own...

For Kirk Douglas, the very crooked man of the title, the film gave scope for bravura playing but the characterization is black and utterly ruthless... Mankiewicz would have done well to consider the view that there is a little bit of goodness even in the worst of men... but the film remains admirable in its staging and in the performances of an exemplary cast...

Douglas, wearing steel-rimmed spectacles and with his hair dyed red, appears at the beginning of the picture as a somewhat cultured bandit; he raids the home of a wealthy rancher and escapes with half a million dollars in cash...

In making his escape, several of his men are shot to death and Douglas himself kills his surviving companion... Thus the swag is entirely his... He hides it in a rattlesnake pit in the desert but he is later spotted in a brothel by the rancher and we next see Douglas on his way to jail...

In the prison wagon are five fellow felons: Hume Cronyn and John Randolph, a pair of con-men, religious fakers and implicitly homosexual; a huge homicidal Chinaman, played by Olympic athlete C. K. Yang in a screen debut; Michael Blodgett, a young man who accidentally killed his girl friend's father when suddenly interrupted in an act of love-making; and Warren Oates, a stupid gunman who shoots sheriff Henry Fonda in the leg when the peaceful, unarmed lawman tries to persuade him to surrender...

These endearing rascals are then incarcerated in a cell with a dirty old fellow called 'The Missouri Kid,' played like a ferret by Burgess Meredith...

The theme, like that of all prison pictures, is escape, and with Douglas openly proud of his hidden half-million, escape becomes inevitable and the wily bandit, a born leader of men, can take his pick not only of his accomplices but of the prison warden (Martin Gabel), a degenerate gentleman, as eager to leave, his post as any prisoner...

However, a noisy fight breaks out among the prisoners and in trying to stop it the warden is killed...

One irony leads to another and the new warden turns out to be Henry Fonda, a solidly honest, humane man who dedicates himself to penal reform... He quickly spots the officer-like qualities of Douglas and assigns him to supervising the building of a new dining hall... It is during the inauguration of the building, attended by the state governor and his guests, that Douglas elects to spark a revolt--his cover for escape...

The motion picture is graphic in depicting the sweat and stench of life in a desert prison, and the frustration and despair of its inmates... The spirit of decency, exemplified by Fonda's warden, is almost a stimulating note in an atmosphere swirling with resentment and spite...

Mankiewicz' film has some memorable moments: Douglas, in his opening robbery, commenting on the excellence of the fried chicken being served at the rancher's table; Hume Cronyn, passing himself off as a deaf mute at a church gathering, backing into a hot stove and yelling a profane curse; a pretty schoolteacher reciting Henley's 'Invictus' at the dining room ceremony, watched by hundreds of hungry eyes; and in the long chaos of the revolt, a furious montage of incidents, particularly the old Missouri Kid sitting, weeping because he has been in prison too long and hasn't the courage to leave ""home,"" and Cronyn, like a firm-minded old wife, leading his companion back into their cell and telling him they will serve out their sentence...",1162684800,10,3818,4.788753799392097
522624,4,6302877873,"Look, if you're looking for a film that'll move mountains, forget it. You cannot take There Was a Crooked Man seriously. That said, if you're looking for a fun film, with a screenplay that departs just enough from the standard conventions of the Western genre to be interesting, then check this out. Think meatloaf and crinkle fries as opposed to steak and taters. The storyline is imaginative, the central characters are likeable, albeit mostly irredeemable, and the dialogue is genuinely humorous...even the awkward and slightly bad late sixties baroque pop score somehow works, (even though you might cringe the first time you hear it open the film). There is enough entertainment value here to merit a DVD release. Take it easy...don't be a snob...you'll have fun with it if you allow yourself.",1129852800,17,798,5.053030303030303
522625,1,6302877873,"What an incredible waste of acting talent ""There Was a Crooked Man"" turned out to be.  Director Joseph Mankiewicz celebrated for classics such as ""All About Eve"" and ""The Barefoot Contessa"" should be embarrassed by this bomb.

Kirk Douglas plays Paris Pittman Jr. a charming, persuasive prisoner incarcerated in Territorial prison for ten years for an armed robbery that netted him $500,000.  He hid the loot prior to his capture.  It's presence is common knowledge among the inmates giving him celebrity status.  Newly appointed warden Woodrow Lopeman played by Henry Fonda is trying to use Douglas' influence to coax the inmates help him initiate prison reform.

Under the guise of playing along with Fonda, Douglas secretly plots his escape to be reunited with his ill gotten cash.

With an excellent cast including Hume Cronyn, Burgess Meredith and Lee Grant, I expected a whole lot more than this disappointing flick delivered.",1108598400,3,932,5.173333333333333
522626,4,6302877873,"A purposefully crass, low-brow, yet engaging Western comedy-drama featuring Kirk Douglas as a ne'er-do-well, debonnaire robber whose half-million dollar heist lands him in a miserable desert prison, which, of course, he is determined to break out of.  Henry Fonda shows up as the newly-appointed, socially progressive warden who spars with this untameable scoundrel, and the two western movie icons have a good time matching wits in this antiheroic romp.  It's not a great flick; the transgressive humor is very much of its time, but it is notable for the surprisingly sympathetic portrayal of two gay convicts who are part of Douglas's escape team... they in fact turn out to be the unlikely heroes of the film, which is as unexpected as it is refreshing.",1072569600,8,756,5.088709677419355

The acting quality of Douglas is far from what one would expect from this man. Ditto for Fonda. The script is positively stupid, though I'm really having difficulty trying to  find a proper word. Just are no words that fit  the bill. I bought this moveie because I found out Hume Cronyn passed away in June (03). He, like the others, fails to live up to past performances. The worst part of this flick is it is just plain STUPID. Wish I had seen this before spending the money on it.

522675,3,6302877873,"Released in 1970, There was a Crooked Man stars Kirk Douglas as a charismatic, but ruthless criminal in the Old West sent to a remote Arizona prison. He develops a relationship with the new progressive warden, a former lawman (Henry Fonda), while corralling his cellmates for an escape attempt with the promise of sharing his hidden loot. The other prisoners include Warren Oates, Burgess Meredith and Michael Blodgett; Alan Hale Jr. plays a guard.

I finally got around to watching this fairly well-known Western. Even though Im a fan of Douglas, I waited so long because I knew it was a comedic Western and that the story revolved around a prison, which didn't make it promising. The good news is that it was better than I thought it would be. While theres some comedy its not an all-out comedy, like Blazing Saddles. Theres just enough seriousness in the tone to take it seriously despite the (black) humor. Plus there are some interesting gems to mine here and there. Moreover Fondas character is interesting in that he extends compassion toward the criminals. But, mostly, its the all-star cast and their interrelations that entertain, not to mention you cant fault the film for being unoriginal.

Despite being a prison picture, there are a few women to enjoy, like Lee Grant and Barbara Rhoades, amongst others.

Some criticize the movie on the grounds that the protagonists are criminal scumbags, but (***SPOILER ALERT***) the ending shows those who insist on fleeing justice and spitting on the new wardens kindness getting their comeuppance while those who don't live. (***END SPOILER***)

The film runs 126 minutes and was shot in La Joya, New Mexico, Joshua Tree, California, and Warner Brothers Burbank Studios, California.

522682,4,6302877873,"Studying the other reviews posted here after viewing, there are a couple of things that threw me. One, could this be a comedy as a number of people maintain? That would explain the lightweight music, which had sounded off for a drama. But gee, a comedy about a sociopath in the person of Kirk Douglas/Paris Pittman Jr.? Prison beatings, riots and dozens of deaths? And Henry Fonda a comedian? THIS is a comedy? If it is, there sure weren't very many laugh-out-loud moments. I think I'd have to differ on this call, and classify it as a drama. As does my library. Either way, it's a difficult choice. Maybe it's a sense of humor test and I've failed it.

Surprise number two, again checking the reviews, is how little five star action there is on this one. Played straight or for laughs, the movie does have much to commend itself. The story line is laid out well, with the viewer meeting each of the future prison convicts in the commission of their crimes. Pace is excellent across the two hour film time, with no clumsy interludes. Location photography is striking, the acting excellent with plenty of familiar faces besides the co-stars. I wasn't wild about the soundtrack music, but that was about all I didn't care for outside of the offhand treatment of all the violence. But hey, watch it and decide for yourself.

Incidentally, I thought the name of the actor portraying the silent Chinaman, C. K. Yang, sounded familiar. So I checked and found that, sure enough, he's got a history too albeit an unusual one. He was silver medalist in the decathlon at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome, and a college teammate and friend of gold medal winner Rafer Johnson at UCLA.

Safe to say, the late C.K.'s English was better than he lets on here in the film.",1412467200,,1755,4.600638977635783

As much as I wanted to like this movie, and I did, I found the end somewhat disappointing.

Perhaps even more so in a early 70's Western with all of its characteristics, including rampant cynicism, blatant anti-heroism, and surprise endings.

There Was A Crooked Man features Douglas as a bank robber who has hidden his loot away, and then gets caught and sent to prison. In prison, he and the warden form a grudging respect for each other. The warden, played by Fonda, was a well known lawman who was wounded in the line of duty, and ended up taking a warden's job because he couldn't perform his old job anymore. Douglas begins to make friends with other inmates, including Warren Oates, who plays a convict with whom no one else wants to bother.

Mankiewicz 's knowing hand, a perfect cast (Warren Oates and Burguess Meredith - what a joy -  and the magnicent shots make of this film a real cult movie.
