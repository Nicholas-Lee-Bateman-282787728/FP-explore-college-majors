8206515,2,B000SR4ZRO,"First video on the DVD was very superficial and did not teach how to take a noon shot.  The second was better, but not good enough to take a noon shot by itself.  It referred to a data sheet which was not included.  Overall not as good as the Davis Manual available on line for free.",1350864000,3,283,4.017857142857143
8206516,3,B000SR4ZRO,"No views through the Sextant, No animation.  Just a guy sitting at a small desk with some paper charts on an easel, talking.  I could have learned as much by reading a book.  Not cheap either.  I was personally disappointed.",1209945600,,224,4.525
8206517,4,B000SR4ZRO,"A good DVD for the begining navigator who wants to learn about the ""noon shot"". The first part goes over theory and calculations, with some humor thrown in. The second part goes into more depth with an actal situation and discusses sextant use, adjustment and care. With the info from this DVD one should be able to successfully take a ""noon shot"" of the sun and calculate where they are on earth.",1080000000,6,397,4.527777777777778
