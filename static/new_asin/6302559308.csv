483100,5,6302559308,"I own the Greg Stump video collection and this is the first video in the series.  I had heard it mentioned in ski forums and seen it mentioned in magazines, but I had no idea as to what it was.

This past winter I received the video collection and sat down to watch this one.  This has since been named ""the best ski movie of all time"" and I agree.  What makes it the best is that, unlike other films, this movie has a storyline to it and features Glen Plake in it before he was a star.  The plot is that Greg is a guy from Maine who wants to make a movie featuring free skiing.  Because of what Stump describes as a litigious nation, Stump decides to film the movie in Chamonix but he needs one more person for the team.

Stump hosts a try-out at Squaw Valley and this guy with long skis and funny hair named Glen Plake shows up.  As Stump put it at the end of the try-out, ""I put in a call in to our office to request a passport and a plane ticket for a Mr. Glen Plake.""

Plake is funny and charismatic.  This is the film that launched his career.  This movie is special because you get to meet the man before he was a legend.

The video shows scenes from Snowbird, Chamonix, and Squaw.  It is very funny and shows some incredible terrain at Chamonix.

This is the original freeskiing movie and a must for any diehard skier.",1348012800,2,1326,4.089147286821706
483101,5,6302559308,"This is one of the best, or maybe the best ski movie ever.  The same goes for Scot Schmidt skiing on his 225 K2's.",1320019200,,114,3.75

483103,5,6302559308,"The best ski film ever made. period.  Stump was influenced by Dick Barrymore and others who had come before, but took ski films to a whole new level with this film.  It helped to launch the career of the great Glen Plake and to bring extreme skiing into the world of non-skiers.  Whether you like great bump skiing (Mike Hattrup), great precise steep skiing (Scot Schmidt) or just enjoy being with rowdy people (Glen Plake), Blizzard is a flick that you will watch again and again for the great skiers and the beauty that Stump is able to convey through his film making techniques.  Please release this title individually on DVD.",1198972800,,629,4.63963963963964
483104,5,6302559308,"This film belongs in the top ten ski/snowboard films of all time, along with the Apocalypse Snow series and The Western Front.  You can buy this as a single DVD or in a box set that includes some of Stump's other films.  Blizzard of Ahhh's, License to Thrill, Groove Requiem: In The Key Of Ski, P-Tex, Lies, and Duct Tape.  Amaz0n sellers are inflating the price, try eB@y.

On a side note, apparently Stump is living in the Grand Targee/Jackson Hole area now and working with the TGR crew.  Hey GS, did you ever find your jacket at the TP?  Keep up the great work!

See ya in the hills...",1142726400,,589,4.3
483105,5,6302559308,"i must have first seen this when i was 6 or 7. i still own it. i cannot express how much i wish that this would get released on dvd. i would buy it in seconds and i believe that most of the ski community would do so as well.

this cronicles the ski adventures of scott schmidt, glen plake and mike hattrup as they travel the globe to ""far off exciting ski places"". some of which are telluride, chamonix, snow bird, squaw valley, etc.

it also contains plenty of ""shorts"" (wheel of destruction), plenty of interviews, craziness, and some of the most beautiful skiing i've ever seen in my life.

this may sound super cheesey, but this makes me more nostalgic than just about any other thing that i own. i have almost cried on occasions when watching this. if you haven't seen this you're probablly not going to be super impressed, it's really really dated. however, if you have seen this, you know what i'm talking about!",1141171200,10,919,4.42603550295858
483106,5,6302559308,"If there is a transition period between the Warren Miller's chuckles and modern ski porn, Blizzard of Aahhhs is it. Greg Stump takes us on a ride filled with the top ski studs of the time (Mr. Plake, Mr. Schmidt and Mr. Hattrup) to cool places to make us want to ski, and ski, and ski... In an interesting transition scene, a couple of guns from Miller's stable go head-to-head with Plake in an insanity jumping contest and they loose badly. From then on, the guard has been switched and the new regime of sick lines and insane jumps has taken over. Pity that this classic has never been matched in subsequent films by Stump or anyone else.",1009756800,4,640,4.432203389830509
483107,5,6302559308,"Greg Stump defined the American ski film with ""Blizzard"".  It is the benchmark for ski action and cinematography with Scot Schmidt, Mike Hattrup, and Glen Plake ripping up the terrain everywhere from Squaw Valley to Chamonix.  This movie flows like a story, and does it better than some of his other flicks.  I personally have watched it close to 200 times (I kind of like skiing) and still enjoy it.  The soundtrack is a must have (if you can find it!). If Warren Miller is all you know about ski movies then forget everything you have learned.  No corny comedy or people falling on tow-ropes here.  You must have this video in your collection, then move on to ""License to Thrill"" and ""Groove Requiem in the Key of Ski"".",1008720000,,721,4.550387596899225

483735,5,6302559308,"I've been looking for this movie for a long time! This is a late classic for me, since my ski-bum days were in the early 1980s, but this was the first ski film that really nailed the excitement and independent culture of freestyle skiing and it did it with a great soundtrack as well. I have had the lead tune ""Snobbery and Decay"" in my iTunes since Napster first came out (couldn't find it for sale anywhere) and have been looking for the film ever since. You gotta love the 1980s outfits and eccentricities and the viewpoint is tangible, meaning I can picture myself actually doing a lot of this, as opposed to newer ""ski-porn"" films, where high risks, skill and courage are so over-the-top that it's hard to imagine doing it yourself. In other words, this film is REAL and shows top notch skiers in some of the best ski areas in the world, pushing their personal limits without risking almost certain death at every turn. The camera work is dated as hell, but I don't care. That's a technology issue that has nothing to do with the content. The GoPro cameras have changed the face of ski films forever, but this classic will never die.",1460505600,2,1138,4.502415458937198
