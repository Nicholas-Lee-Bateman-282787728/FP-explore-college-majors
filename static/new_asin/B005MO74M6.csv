4834807,5,B005MO74M6,"This is a very good collection of Disney Christmas 'shorts' from the late 1990's.

I bought these for my daughter was was about 7 or so when these first came out on VHS. She absolutely loved them then and does to this day (she's almost 23 now and a first year med student). Some of the stories are better than others - for example I thought the Mnnie Mouse and Daisy skating piece was kind of weak - but they are all at least above average for this type of short. Anamation was very good - not as good a feature but way above average for this type of production.

I thought the two with Donalds nephews in/re the repeat of Christmas (ala Groundhog Day) and the one at the North Pole at Santas workshop where they try and repair their bad boy listings were the 2 best. Mickeys and Minies take on The Gift of the Magi was very cute as well!

I would rate these a very good 8.25 to 8.75 out of 10 - recommended for Disney fans, Christmas fans and almost anyone young at heart!",1415836800,7,973,4.137566137566138

4834809,5,B005MO74M6,"I used to own the first one on VHS years ago when I was a kid & I would watch them every single year around Christmas. I just pre-ordered this movie & I am so excited, can't wait to get it!! I haven't watched them in so long. If you love classic Mickey Mouse, Donald Duck, Goofy, ect. cartoons then you will love these two movies! Great for the whole family! I am an adult now & I still love watching Mickey's Christmas during the holidays. Mickey's Once Upon a Christmas is 3 separate Christmas stories... the first story is about Donald Duck & his nephews repeating Christmas day, the second one is about Goofy & Max believing in Santa, & the last one is about Mickey & Minnie giving each other a special gift. The stories have a lot of heart & great meanings to them. The 2nd movie, Mickey's Twice Upon a Christmas wasn't as good as the 1st, in my opinion... it was cute, but too ""computerized"".",1414454400,3,898,4.288235294117647
4834810,5,B005MO74M6,"For years, people have been wanting to see Mickey's Once AND Twice Upon A Christmas as a 2-Movie Collection, on DVD or Blu-ray, and now we're getting our wish... at least as a 3-disc combo pack. This one's for the history websites, as the first movie is the 2D hand-drawn original (completely restored in HD, but very surprisingly NOT in Faux-Widescreen, like Beauty and the Beast: The Enchanted Christmas was seen several years ago on TV and on its own DVD/Blu-ray release from 2011.) and the sequel being the 3D CGI follow-up that pre-dated the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse. According to the total reviews for both movies separately, it seems I'm not the only one who prefers the CGI sequel to the hand-drawn original. With me, the middle story had a lot of pessimism about the big guy in red, until the real Santa DID come, very late. The sequel never had such a level of pessimism, and thank goodness for that; that's why I prefer the sequel over the original, even before getting cropped to Widescreen on ABC Family, Disney Channel and Disney XD; the original is in a very-natural-looking Widescreen format, just like the CGI sequel, on DVD AND Blu-ray, even better-looking when comparing it to earlier videotapes, DVDs, and footage from it in the extended version of Disney's Very Merry Christmas Songs! Both movies originally came to VHS and DVD on November 9th (1999 and 2004), and have become beloved holiday classics ever since, and now we can see them both in 1 collection. Most likely, many folks thought the DVDs would be reissues of the 2000 and 2004 DVD releases, yes even me, as low as this combo pack is and with no DVD-only option; but it turns out both of the DVDs are brand-new AND Fastplay-enhanced, and still under $25 altogether! Two-movie Collections with reissued DVDs were known to happen with other 2-Movie Collections with $25-or-less price tags, like Lilo and Stitch, Brother Bear, The Hunchback of Notre Dame, Atlantis, The Emperor's New Groove, and the Oliver and Company/Fox and the Hound 1 and 2 Three-movie set only from the Disney Movie Club; all of those contain re-issued DVDs from 2002 to 2011, commercials and all, and the discs are usually on top of each other no matter if you choose DVD or Blu-ray packaging, thus many fans calling such a thing ""cheaply put together"" for they might easily get scratched up without disc trays, and nearly all of them have no DVD-only 2-Movie releases. But I digress, both Christmas movies contain a bunch of amazing tidbits in toon history, like toon legend Jim Cummings having no less than 9 different roles in the first movie, including Pete and the real Santa, the impostor who tried to rob Pete's house AND the cop who ratted the crook out. Others include the hippos and gators from Fantasia being in the sequel and Blitzen making a reference to Burrito from The Three Caballeros, or more recently Donkey and his pixie dust accident in Shrek 1 (hence Blitzen's flying donkey gag). The first movie contains the famous band The Firehouse Five Plus Two (minus two in the movie, but all as dog-like people, like in DuckTales), and some of Mickey's dancing at the toy drive was lovingly-mimicked from his 1942 short Mickey's Birthday Party, as the sequel features Max's new girl Mona, being played by the actress who played Roxanne in A Goofy Movie and at the House of Mouse. And both movies contain Russi Taylor as Huey, Dewey and Louie, like she voiced them for DuckTales, Cartoon All-stars to the Rescue, and Disney's Sing Along Songs collection, as well as the same medley finale music if you listen to both of them closely, as they end. What's more, Mickey and Minnie's traditional ear recipe wasn't perfected in the CGI sequel, but it finally was perfected in CGI by the final season of the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse; in other words, their ears didn't stay perfectly round whichever way they turned in Mickey's Twice Upon A Christmas. It'd be a miracle if we finally saw a 2-Movie Collection of A Goofy Movie and An Extremely Goofy Movie in 2015, for their respective 20th and 15th anniversaries, as this Christmassy one celebrates their 15th and 10th anniversaries. If you can't stand the Mickey Mouse Clubhouse and yearn to see Mickey and his gang like they were, before said series was ever made, don't hesitate to add this 2-Movie Christmas Collection to your Christmas classics menageries today! I'm sure my sister and niece would love to have this in their library, alongside Mickey's Magical Christmas & Mickey's Christmas Carol (together and separate).",1413244800,5,4531,4.81025641025641

I just felt I should at least acknowledge that you get the second one too. But the first one is the good one. The second one is not memorable, and the animation is an eyesore.

I love the first one. It has the beautiful traditional hand-drawn animation we all love. And it's the finest quality of animation that we've all come to know and expect from Disney. The stories are wonderful. My favorite one growing up was the Goofy & Max one. But over the years, the Micky and Minnie is without a doubt my favorite of the three. If anything, this is worth getting because this is one of the last traditional hand-drawn animation films that Disney will ever make.",1451088000,,822,4.303225806451613
