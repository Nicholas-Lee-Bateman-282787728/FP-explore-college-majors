7452692,5,B015WO4UZ4,"Beautifully done; Even my 5 year old grandson sits and watches, almost hypnotized. Occasionally,  I fast forward through to deep scientific information. Well worth the cost.",1468454400,4,173,5.653846153846154
7452693,5,B015WO4UZ4,"This series was wonderful!  After watching it, I have no doubt that there is an intelligence behind life. I learned so many interesting things about sea creatures, butterflies, and birds. Some of the highlights for me:  Dolphins have an echolocation system to track fish similar to a radar.  Many creatures have a built-in GPS system that allows them to navigate incredibly long migrations.  A caterpillar transitioning into a butterfly is analogous to a model T Ford building a garage around itself and then converting itself into a plane. The video footage is pretty spectacular, especially for the Butterfly film.",1458432000,13,616,5.191919191919192
7452694,5,B015WO4UZ4,"I really appreciate these dvds. They offer marvelous details about just some of the marvels of nature in our world that are mind-boggling. The stated evidence within these dvds without a doubt point to an intelligent Creator. For those who believe in a Creator, you will be immersed in all the more wonder. It is difficult for me to fathom how some can view, experience, wonder about, and even learn of the innumerable facts of nature that reflect infinite wisdom, and claim to believe within themselves such design came to be by some unintelligent unguided process. I ask those: if all DID come to be via an unintelligent unguided random process then why is it when a person is 'driven' by an unintelligent unguided random process we consider that individual insane????
Consider: a crowd viewing colorful paintings of various scenes of nature in an art venue. If I were to suggest the paintings just came to be without a painter, how many would look at me like I was mentally unstable? Yet if you were to take them to view the actual scenes that had inspired the painter, how many when asked about the origin of our universe would claim a belief in an unintelligent unguided random process?
Many of these same ones DO marvel over nature then pooh pooh or worse those who believe it was the Biblical God who caused the miracle of our universe and all that is in it. Who believes the greater miracle? One who acknowledges an eternal all powerful miraculous spiritual Creator that created the material mortal world, or one who believes all they marvel at came to be by sheer 'happenstance'? In our current reality, can something truly come from NO thing? Can a lesser cause cause a greater cause?",1458345600,18,1694,4.707070707070707
7452695,5,B015WO4UZ4,Loved it. The series are jam-packef with facts and evidence. Suddenly the intelligent design argument looks more solid. Great videos!,1454544000,3,133,5.7
7452696,5,B015WO4UZ4,"This is so well done! I want more of these kind of videos! Amazing! What a testament to the Creator! There is no specific mention of ""God"" -- it is a masterfully done argument for Intelligent design -- literally dismantling evolution with visible proof for a Creator. Evolution can't explain the realities that are before our eyes. Creation is wondrous, miraculous and proves that YHVH Elohim exists! ""All nations should worship and glorify YHVH, because He made them. He alone is Elohim. No other gods are great like Him, because they cannot do works like His works [including creation]."" Psalm 86:8-10",1454371200,4,603,4.98019801980198

7452699,5,B015WO4UZ4,"As a former wildlife biologist and current biology teacher, I think this set of videos is wonderful!  It is insightful, factually accurate, very entertaining, and beautifully filmed.  I'd certainly recommend this set of videos to whomever is interested in biology, and especially to those interested in the age-old question of intelligent design vs. evolution.",1445990400,10,360,5.648148148148148

7452701,5,B015WO4UZ4,Purchased as a Christmas gift for grandchildren so haven't seen it yet.  I was glad to be able to purchase something that will counter the theory of evolution that is taught as fact in public school indoctrination.  The grandchildren have a special interest in butterflies so I think they will love this.,1503532800,2,304,4.826923076923077

7452706,5,B015WO4UZ4,"Best movie on real science in life. Stating any assumptions as just that an assumption, but with much real science to back up there assumptions not using circular reasoning. Best movie to watch with the kids for homeschooling lessons on biology and science. Very interesting, images and photos are gripping and awe inspiring.",1495411200,2,325,5.150943396226415

8734769,5,B015WO4UZ4,"Most that I speak to are ignorant on this perspective on research.  If you are intellectually honest, you need to consider this perspective to make an informed decision on how to interpret the evidence you see in the world.",1527897600,,223,4.717948717948718

8734772,5,B015WO4UZ4,Darwin's Theory of Evolution is just that a theory and boy was it a mistake that is shot to pieces by this documentary.,1510876800,,119,4.217391304347826

8734775,5,B015WO4UZ4,Very well put together. Gives the listener the ability to hear facts for themselves. Very clear that creation is much too ordered down to the tiniest observed particles for it to just spring up from randomness. Too much has to be just right.,1509667200,,241,4.627906976744186
