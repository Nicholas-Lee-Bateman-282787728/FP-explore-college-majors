8317852,5,B001LEG364,"I've been trying to acquire this show for years. It was always too expensive, like in the $40 range. When I finally found it for $9.99 I jumped at the chance to get it, and I wasn't let down at all.

All the matches had a purpose and were good in their own right. Storm vs Harris kicked ass..Roode vs Jarrett was good..Joe/AJ, you can't go wrong.",1363564800,,346,4.164179104477612
8317853,3,B001LEG364,"X Division Champion Chris Sabin vs. Jay Lethal vs. Sonjay Dutt - This was around the time Lethal started doing the Black Machismo gimmick with the story being that Dutt was getting jealous of all the attention Kevin Nash was giving Lethal to develop his character so there was tension between Lethal & Dutt throughout the match. The match was your typical X division opener with some nice ground work & high flyin' mixed together. For those who don't remember, the ending with Nash & Dutt didn't lead to anything but the birth of his ""Guru"" character.

Jeff Jarrett vs. Robert Roode - Jarrett was revealed as the personal friend of Eric Young giving him advice in his situation with Roode & Brooks leading to his match. Before the bell & in the beginning of the match, it was Roode brawling with Jarrett throughout the outside of the ring. From there, it went into a back & forth wrestling match with both men trading dueling sleeper holds & figure 4's at various times. Ms. Brooks got heavily involved at times as well before Roode eventually got the clean victory.

Rhino vs. Christopher Daniels - This was just a nice back & forth match between the two with story of Daniels focusing on Rhino's left arm & shoulder throughout the match after hitting it on a ringpost early in the match. Good match.

Basham & Damaja (the former Basham Brothers from WWE) vs. Kip James - This was a short match that was just to put over a storyline than anything else as B.G. was jumped before the match making his a handicap match with Basham & Damaja won in less than 5 mins. Dud.

Texas Death Match: Chris Harris vs. James Storm - Their first match at Lockdown was one of the worst matches this year...but after this one, you'll forget that match happened because this heavily made up for it & more. This was under old school Death Match rules where you had to score a pinfall & the loser has a 10 count to get to his feet or lose. They started brawling in the crowd right from the start and went back into the ring with both men heavily bleeding throughout the match & taking some punishment like both men going through tables, being hit with their finishing moves, dueling trash can lips, and even Jackie Moore & Gail Kim getting involved. The fans described this match perfectly...""This Is Awesome.""

Jerry Lynn vs. Senshi vs. Tiger Mask IV vs. Alex Shelley - This was more of a ground based X division match than the usual mix of wrestling & high flyin'. Each man's different type of wrestling styles mixed together to deliever another good match.

NWA Tag Team Champions Team 3D vs. L.A.X. vs. Tomko & Scott Steiner - Even before the match started, there was tension between Steiner & Tomko based off the fact that they couldn't trust each other. This match was really just average as it just never got past ""first gear."" The miscommunications between Steiner & Tomko lead to the 3D victory but the real story here was at the end with Rick Steiner coming to TNA & reuniting the Steiner Brothers.

Samoa Joe vs. A.J. Styles - This match was about Joe beating A.J. Styles at his own game as A.J. once again faked an injury to get the advantage over Joe early in the match only for Joe to do the same thing later in the bout to help gain the victory. Whenever you have a Joe vs. Styles match, you know your going to get a good quality match & that wasn't any different here eventhough this one wasn't on the same level as their previous series of matches for the X Division championship in the past.

NWA Champion Christian Cage vs. Sting vs. Kurt Angle - Most of the the match was about all three men at various times taking out one man so the other two could settle their differences as all three men weren't in the ring together until the final 3 minutes. Kurt Angle made Sting tap out while Sting had Christian pinned with a roll up. This main event was average as it only went 10 mins. which isn't long enough for this to turn into something.
As a side note, the NWA cut all ties with TNA earlier in the day, regaining control of the World Heavyweight Championship and World Tag Team Championship, stripping Cage and Team 3D of their titles. TNA just replaced 3D's NWA Tag Team Titles with the TNA Tag Team Championships while the first TNA World Champion would be crowned at Slammiversary...hense, the controversal ending to the World Title match.

In the end, the only real bomb here was the Kip James handicap match as the rest of the matches were average at the very least & with the Texas Death Match stealing the show & eventually becoming a ""Match Of The Year"" canidate. I recommend.",1278460800,,4644,4.479905437352246
