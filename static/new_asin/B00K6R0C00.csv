6403954,1,B00K6R0C00,I very much like the series - all seasons but I was very disappointed with this dvd collection - there were 5 dvds and every dvd had one episode on it that started to play and then stopped and went back to the menu and there was no way to watch the whole episode.  And you never knew when it was going to happen or in which episode - I was so disappointed.  And it was not just this specific dvd - i actually ordered this season from another company and the exact same episodes did the exact same thing in the exact same spot.  So now I have all the other seasons but not this one.,1426204800,2,581,3.948717948717949
6403955,1,B00K6R0C00,As I started to play the episodes the second disc stopped in the middle of an episode and would not go any farther so I sent it back.  It's not the first time I received faulty dvd's from Amazon. Very frustrating.,1423785600,,213,4.195121951219512

8656437,2,B00K6R0C00,"I'm very dissatisfied with the season six I received. Disc 3 doesn't play all the episodes. It cuts off after the 3rd episode starts. Since it has taken me this long to get to watching season six it's to late to return. I've purchased all the seasons and was disappointed that many episodes are missing. As an avid watcher of this show I've counted over 30 episodes that are missing so far. I'm still glad I have them but, I sure wish the episodes that are on the disc would have played. I am a true lover of Amazon so I didn't look elsewhere for the DVDs but I have heard they can be purchased at other places. But you may end up with bootlegged copies so just beware. It's best to purchase them here and watch them before its to late to return.",1500508800,,746,4.1875
8656438,5,B00K6R0C00,I have become very addicted to this series as it brings up all kinds of issues and the sheriff is wise in his decisions,1483315200,,119,4.0

8656441,1,B00K6R0C00,"Hate part no reflection on the Title, problems with the DVD's.  None would play all the way through.  It was replaced but the second was no better than the first.",1443916800,,162,4.366666666666666
8656442,5,B00K6R0C00,"All of these discs in this series were gifts...VERY well received, and STILL talked about a month after the fact!",1437436800,,113,4.7
8656443,1,B00K6R0C00,Bought this season and have become very unhappy with it after watching it only to have the episodes freeze up and skip. I believe the issues are occurring from the hand made labels on the discs as this tends to happen with these type of labels I have come acrossed in the past. Anyways I am disappointed about this issue and the fact there is an episode missing as well. I was intending on buying the rest of the seasons of this series but now I'm hesitant and will instead DVR this series as thankfully this series still airs on WGN.,1436400000,,534,4.297029702970297
8656444,3,B00K6R0C00,I am disappointed in this DVD because an important episode is missing or maybe two.  You have failed to satisfy me your customer.  I will reconsider ordering anything again from Amazon.  You create commercials on TV which do not tell the whole family.  The episodes were pivotal regarding Chief Gillespie and his Daughter.  Shame on you.,1436227200,,337,4.946428571428571
