1974295,5,B00015YVO0,"the third series of this show is just as good if not better than the first two.  At first the voice change got in my way of enjoying it, but I continued watching it, and also noticed the slight lack of care as far as  the animation was concerned.  But Once that wonderful ship got off of Earth  and that familiar Wave Motion engine sound started going, I was in the  show.  The story  is very good, Desslock as usual IS THE MAN.  For those of  you watching this, do not let the over acting get to you, later on they  work and the story is one faithful to Star Blazer/Yamato storyline.  Enjoy",958694400,10,591,4.1415929203539825
1974296,5,B00015YVO0,"Of course, it starts with ""Only one year remains before all life parishes on Earth"", cliche' just like the First Series, and finding Leader Desslock calling General Talon ""Sergeant Masterson"". But I believe it's still a decent part of the series.",1389225600,,246,5.024390243902439
1974297,4,B00015YVO0,"I have to say I like Bolar Wars every bit as much as I did QUEST FOR ICANDAR and COMET EMPIRE.  The different in dubbed voice acting didn't bother me as much as i thought since between the subtitled 5 movie box set and 2012 Space Battleship Yamato 2199 series I've gotten use to different voices coming from the characters.  I thought it was interesting in episode one that when one cadet reported to Wildstar that we see another officer in the room wearing the type of Star Blazers uniform later seen in the Yamato Resurrection movie.  Dr. Sane's (Sadto) new nurse remind me a lot of the nurse he has in the modern 2012  series.  The opening and closing credits in original Japanese is great.  I'm surprise that unlike 2012 series though that Bolar Wars sometimes  have Japanese subtitles for people and places names appear on the screen but not English subtitles as well.  Having stuff like a Cafeteria appear in new refitted Yamato remind me more of 2012 series than the first 2 seasons of Star Blazers.

The story about Earth having problem with the sun that make me think of Krypton's sun in Superman stories and search for a new Earth to live only to discover a new enemy along the way is great.  Having been made in 1980s the animation is better than first two series while still giving same feel of the original seasons.",1371427200,4,1328,4.518828451882845
1974298,4,B00015YVO0,"something new for me after all these years . but try to catch up on the first two series. It's looks good

1974299,1,B00015YVO0,"The first two Star Blazers series' are disgraced by this addition to the collection. The dreadful voice characterizations, along with the inane dialogue, ruined the already weak plot. It's not just that the voices are different from the original cast...it's that they are BAD voices period! Poorly chosen voices made this almost unwatchable. Not even worth renting!",1300579200,4,365,5.421052631578948
1974300,3,B00015YVO0,"Star Blazers - The Bolar Wars - The Complete Series 3 Collection is a DVD box set that contains six DVDs.  All twenty-five episodes that comprise this rarely-seen third Star Blazers series are included.  There are five episodes on the first disc, and then four episodes on each of the remaining five DVDs in the set.

There are a number of special features spread out between the six DVDs.  There is a spaceship database for the Star Force, the Galman Empire, the Bolar Federation, as well as Earth and Others.  There is character data for the Star Force, the Galman Empire, the Bolar Federation, and others.  There is a mecha database for the Star Force, the Galman Empire, and the Bolar Federation.  There are stellar maps and episode guides for the episodes that appear on each disc; the stellar maps show where the Argo has traveled to on each disc.  There are even ""Hidden Features"" (these are basically deleted scenes from the episodes).

If you're a fan of Star Blazers and want to get all of the Bolar Wars series on DVD, then I would recommend purchasing this set.  While the voices may be different from the first two series, this series has a good storyline going for it.",1245801600,4,1182,4.6124401913875595
1974301,3,B00015YVO0,Animation is great.  Color and detail very good.  Music good although theme song is Japanese.  Difficult to get used to new character voices.  Story line is inaccurate.  Just okay for me.,1179273600,,187,4.903225806451613
1974302,3,B00015YVO0,"The plot is sort of a rehash of the Quest for Iscandar. Two alien space fleets(The Bolar Federation and the Galman Empire) are fighting it out on the outside of Earth's solar system. Both fleets are equiped with planet destroying Proton Missiles. During the battle a Proton Missile is misfired and goes astray plunging into the sun causing a nuclear fussion reaction. This causes the heat to intensify on Earth day by day and the task of finding a new planet before the sun goes supernova has become a priority. Ready for the rehash part? Earth has ""only 1 year"" to find a new planet suitable for colonization. The Star Force led by Commander Wildstar is assigned the task. They even tell you how many days are left at the end of every episode. LOL

Voyager Entertainment Inc. (VEI) has packaged this series as being the ""Lost Episodes."" To American TV audiences who loved the first two series, these episodes were indeed ""lost."" This 3rd series was created in Japan in 1981 and was dubbed into English for American audiences in 1985 (but had VERY limited distribution). Unfortunatly the original voice cast for the first two seasons due to being non-union and uncredited for their work on those series in 1979 could not be found to return to their old roles. So, the Speed Racer cast of Peter Fernandez, Corinne Orr, Jack Grimes, etc. voiced the 3rd series. So you can imagine my disappointment when Leader Desslok spoke his first words and instead of that pompus evil Gamilon dictator I'd come to know and love he sounded more like Mr. Peabody the dog from the Rocky and Bullwinkle cartoons...

Because the 3rd series was dubbed so long after the first two (which were dubbed at the same time) there were errors in character names and continuity problems. Due to poor research Leader Desslok's aide General Talan was carelessly renamed Sgt. Masterson.

The biggest inconsistancy for me was the the use of the name ""Star Force."" In the first two seasons Desslok, Lysis, Zordar, Captain Gideon, you name it! They all called the crew of the Argo the ""Star Force."" When the Argo was appraoching a Gamilon base or a Comet Empire Fleet they were refered to as, ""the Star Force is approaching!"" Not, ""the Argo is coming."" Not the case in this 3rd season. While the name ""Argo"" was rarley heard in seasons 1+2, ""Star Force"" was always used. In the 3rd season, the opposite. ""Argo"" is used a LOT more than ""Star Force."" I think a lot of the charm was lost in season 3 because of that.

The biggest error was not so much an error but a real tacky way for them(the American company that dubbed the 3rd series) to cover up the huge story gap between series 2: ""The Comet Empire"" and series 3. Two movies were released in Japan that took place between the two TV series; ""Space Battleship Yamato: The New Voyage/Journey"" and ""Be Forever Yamato."" In these movies Earth is threatened by yet another enemy, the Dark Nebula Empire. In the New Voyage we find out the fate of Queen Starsha and Alex Wildstar on Iscandar and where the Gamilons and Earth stood after the Comet Empire was defeated. Here's the cover up; in the middle of this 3rd series when the Argo.. ahem STAR FORCE reaches planet Galman they are reunited with their former foe Desslok. A flash back sequence is shown of Desslok and the Star Force first as enemies and later progressing as allies in fighting off a Dark Nebula Gorba Space fortress. In this American dubbed version of Bolar Wars, the Dark Nebula craft is wrongfully named the Comet Empire because the comapny that dubbed this series felt that since the two movies that followed Series 2 were never shown to American audiences, they wouldn't know who the Dark Nebulans were in this 3rd series flashback. Confused? I hope not, or I'm a lousy storyteller. LOL

In fact here is the order to watch the Star Blazers/Yamato universe:

1. Series 1: The Quest for Iscandar

(you can also watch the 1st Space Battleship Yamato movie)

2. Series 2: The Comet Empire

3. Space Battleship Yamato: The New Voyage

4. Be Forever Yamato

5. Series 3: The Bolar Wars

6. Final Yamato

Because this series was dubbed by a different company than that of the one that dubbed the first two series, the violence was left alone and casualties were aplenty. But don't think that this series was the most violent. The first two just had theirs sanitized. Yet another inconsistancy... Now if they'd left the first 2 seasons uncut and used the original English voice cast for season 3 we would finally be able to have our cake and eat it too. :)",1170115200,40,4533,4.623134328358209
1974303,1,B00015YVO0,"Let me start by saying that I have watched the original US Star Blazers (series 1 and 2) when it was televised, and now I currently own all 3 series. There are a lot of reviews about Series 1 and 2 already, my summary on those is that they were as good as I remembered when I saw them televised - good drama, good story, somewhat inconsistent yet decent animation (excellent back in those days - yes I am that old). But when I started watching Series 3 and have viewed most of the episodes so far. It is BORING compared by far to Series 1 and 2. The voices of some of the main characters have changed to be more ""wimpy"", definitely not the voices of heroes that are suppose to protect the Earth. Most of the episodes are drawn out and lack any real plot. There is very little relevant story connection between this series and the others before it. You will not be missing out on anything about Star Blazers by skipping series 3, the Bolar Wars.",1149465600,19,944,4.25
1974304,5,B00015YVO0,"I resisted getting the Bolar Wars because I really didn't want to listen to English voices that were different from the ones I am used to from the first two series [also because of the negative feedback I have read on the voice acting]. So, I decided to get the original version with English subtitles.

I figured that would be easier for me to cope with, plus I was curious how the look and feel would differ in this form. Well, I love it! Just love it! Reading subtitles took some getting used to [as well as navigating the menu], but once I did, it was great viewing.

The Bolar Wars is a great story. The characters we know and love are far more developed and I fell in love with the new ones introduced. The animation is vastly improved from the first two series.

I am very happy I purchased this. Maybe someday I will also get the English version just to compare.",1141862400,6,870,4.2926829268292686
1974305,5,B00015YVO0,"The ""Wildstar"" character has matured and developed for this series.  He is now officially the commander of the Argo.  Emperor Desslok is actually a better ally than a foe.  The other main characters from the series one and two are back except for Orion, the chief engineer.  Most of the English voices are new ones, which gives the series a different feel altogether.  The Bolars initially appear to be friendly towards the Argo, which has a new look and more weapons, but the Bolars are evil.  Desslok is a show stopper in all three series and will not disappoint anyone. The mission of the Argo in this series is to stop Earth's sun from going nova, and trying to find a possible new home for the people of Earth.  Like series one it has a countdown to annihilation.  The peaceful planet Gardiana has the key which might save the day or will it?  Buy it, watch it and find out.",1123027200,11,879,4.44375

8007148,2,B00015YVO0,"Didn't like it. Different English voices, with the exception of Eddie Allen, who still does Desslock and Dash, but he can't save this season. Bad plot. Awkward animation. This third season doesn't flow well at all with the first two seasons (Iscandar and Comet Empire). Even for die-hard Star Blazers fans, this is a tough watch to wade through. After Comet Empire, I'd just go straight to the movies instead.",1515283200,,409,4.857142857142857

ABOVE ALL OTHER FAULTS.....even with subtitle there was still things that i didn't understand. why? BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SUBTITLED!!!! yes they story dialogue was subtitled but should i have to into the special features to TRY to find the names of the generals and such?to be blunt at the end of it all i said ""I am done yes!!! now that i have watched crap crap I can watch quality crap"" went to watch POWER RANGERS thank you very much. I am looking to bury this in the deepest darkest place possible in my house. To buy this is to regret it. I CAN ONLY GIVE YOU ONE JUSTIFICATION to buy it and that is to say i have all three collections now. my advice if you are not a collector then stop at comet empire.",1412640000,,1207,4.162393162393163
8007154,3,B00015YVO0,"The third season of Star Blazers--the English language version of the Yamato anime from Japan--is a major letdown after the first two. The Bolar Wars"" is probably best known as the lost"" season of Star Blazers"" and only the most passionate fans of the show will enjoy it. While the animation is better, the Bolar Wars simply feels stale as many of the same plot devices from the past--limited time for the Argo to rescue Earth, underground cities being forced into usage, a psychic alien queen who helps the Argo--are trotted out once again. Different voice actors don't help matters and it is tough to accept them for familiar characters like Derek Wildstar, Nova and Desslok. Still, the animation is better and there are some fine moments, especially when the focus stays on Wildstar and Desslok. Mark Venture, who had been one of the leading characters in the second season, rightfully goes back to his role as a supporting player. There are some new characters but they simply aren't as compelling despite getting too much focus. The villains simply aren't as interesting as they were in past seasons. While fans will enjoy parts of the third season, it fails to live up to where this franchise had been before.",1409443200,2,1215,4.818181818181818
