3493581,5,B001BKLCCS,"This was an absolutely fascinating documentary that followed 6 diabetic individuals who changed their eating habits drastically, under medical supervision.  I would have liked a little more information on how the patients were selected, and how much diabetic education they had prior to their trip to Patagonia, AZ.  It was astonishing to see the dramatic effect their diets had on their health.  Not every patient was willing to make the necessary adjustments to ensure their good health, of course.  I was extremely impressed with the results and thought the food they were eating looked quite delicious. There is an additional segment that really discusses the food.  I highly recommend this if you are diabetic or have someone in your family who is.  It certainly shows the relationship between diet and health.",1254096000,51,815,5.183206106870229
3493582,5,B001BKLCCS,This dvd is an amazing movie. It's only for those who really want to get rid of diabetes. I have cut my insulin in half and have brought my blood pressure into normal zone.,1251158400,4,172,4.088235294117647
3493583,4,B001BKLCCS,"I found this documentary to be very inspiring.  It takes you through the experiences of 6 people with Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes who decide to go on a retreat that includes a raw food diet for 30 days.  Their reactions to the food are funny, real and human.  The results are amazing!  I loved the racial, age, and ethnic diversity in the participants.  The film also gives a 6 month follow-up after they complete the program.

My only beef is that I would have liked a 30 minute section on raw food preparation. After seeing the documentary, I was all hyped up to increase my consumption of raw foods...",1246838400,9,602,4.378378378378378
3493584,5,B001BKLCCS,"With the overwhelming evidence that our toxic food/drug/health system is wildly dangerous and ineffective this timely little film not only informs but presents the human experience that any one of us would likely go through in radically changing our addictions to toxic foods and the status quo. I've eaten ""health food"" since leaving home at 18. Even 4 decades later, there is always something new to learn and try and raw foods are opening up a whole new level of health and fitness to me and those I love. As a nation we need to be seeing this type of thing on TV. Highly recommended for everyone whether you have diabetes (I don't) or not.

I have shown it to dozens of people! I personally do the Hallelujah Diet and Lifestyle for the past almost 4 yrs and as of 2009, I eat 100% Raw living foods, I am in good health, with no issues, although I used to have arthritis (The reason I changed my diet at age 41) I am now 45 and I have no arthritis! I LOVE this DVD, RAW food is amazing and if you learn from others you can make all kinds of great tasting raw foods, I have learned for every food I have loved, from pizza, tacos and Cheeseburgers and chips, I have created a replacement that tastes better and is much more nutritous for me. The Standard American Diet (SAD) diet is killing us in American. I personally have a friend who adopted the HA diet and in less than 30 days he was down from 4 shots to one shot a day of insulin. He still ate too much cooked foods, but had he went 100% raw he would have been Free from Diabetes. Watch this DVD, it is an Excellent real movie-like DVD. I have watched it many times.

This DIE-abetes DVD doc can be viewed as educational, but for me, it is a motivational tool to stay on course with a raw foods lifestyle makeover.",1228953600,8,436,4.265060240963855
3493588,5,B001BKLCCS,"All I can say is WOW.  I'd heard about this film when it was on the independent film festival circuit and couldn't wait to see it - especially after enjoying Morgan Spurlock's film 'Super Size Me' so much.  If you think tv's reality show 'The Biggest Loser' is good inspiration for getting healthier and in shape, than this journey will really knock your socks off!  A handful of 'real' people are introduced to a whole new way to approach and improve their health - and we get to go along for the ride!  It's so much fun, and entertaining too - ""reality"" media at it's best. It's incredibly inspiring to watch these folks lose weight, lower their blood sugar levels naturally and make some great friendships while learning that you don't need to be at the mercy of insulin for the rest of your life.  If you work in the field of ""health care"" (as I do) you have a responsibility to offer options like this to your patients and clients.  And if you know anyone with diabetes - and chances are, with the prevalence of this disease being what it is, that you do - you and they just shouldn't miss out.

radical diet changes such as suggested are much harder to maintain and manage long term. this is more about the vegan agenda than diabetics.

3493616,5,B001BKLCCS,"Dr. Gabriel Cousens, M.D. of the Tree of Life Centre in Arizona is one of the few medical doctors in the world who actually know how to cure people of diabetes and other degenerative diseases. Instead of merely treating their symptoms with medications, he addresses the root causes of his patients' illnesses and helps them attain a true cure. This documentary follows the healing journey of a diverse group of diabetic patients of different ages, races, ethnic backgrounds, and sexes. Dr. Gabriel Cousens places them on a raw-food diet for 30 days under the medical supervision of himself and his medical colleagues. As their blood sugar gradually approaches normal levels on the greatly improved diet, the doctors gradually keep reducing their insulin dosages. By the end of the 30 days, some of the patients are completely cured and free of insulin, while a few others are still diabetic but so greatly improved that they are on much lower insulin dosages than before.

This documentary shows not only the fascinating journey of the physical healing of these patients but also the emotional and social sides of healing. Some of the patients feel like giving up, quitting this special diet to which they are not accustomed, and going home before they've made sufficient progress - before the 30 days are up - and the other patients try to encourage them to stick with the program, in some cases successfully and in some cases not. This shows how important the emotional support of other human beings is in one's physical healing - how diet and other physical treatments are not enough - how the caring bestowed upon one by others can likewise make a huge difference in one's outcome.

This is a beautiful and moving documentary - the most beautiful documentary I have ever watched. I highly recommend it!",1393891200,4,1806,4.898692810457517

To be honest, I could not sit through this film. There is soooo much verbage about what people go through with diabetes that has NOTHING to do with curing it or changing your diet or lifestyle. After about 15 minutes I scanned through the rest of the program and found very little real information. If you want to sympathize with how people struggle with diabetes, then watch this film.",1393200000,6,484,4.5
3493619,5,B001BKLCCS,"If you thought diabetes could only be managed, but not cured, think again. This is an inspiring film even for people without diabetes. That would include me. I wanted to see how raw foods could make a difference and I also wanted to cut back as much as I could on starchy carbs and sugar. How do you do change your diet and stick to it? That's a real challenge and the film shows how at times this is so hard to do, but certainly not impossible with the right support.

It's just a great story too, with very real people who have a hard time changing their habits and their minds. I only wish they added a follow up with the people who participated to see where they are now.

Would have been better to give more indepth results on all patients. Not sure what the intent of the movie was but it certainly did not convince me that going raw was the way to go. there are much better nutrition movies out there than this- sick fat and nearly dead, Gerson Miracle, food matter, forks over knives just to name a few. I had hoped I would be able to give this to friends to watch and get them to go raw to improve their health- going raw DOES work- but this movie did nothing to show why it works, how well it works or how to make it work. Poorly done which is sad becuase it could have really helped a lot of people. This did not give any motivation.",1385337600,2,778,4.125

While this DVD does not show the exact methods used, it does show that for a lot of people with Diabetes, there is potentially hope, again, if done right.  If you have someone you know that is Diabetic, if they want to quit being one, they may want to look into this.  It might help them.

There were also people who lost 30 pound in 30 days, that in itself is not healthy. The fact that they are calling it a cure is quite false, because if anyone on this diet goes back to eating outside that diet the disease will still be there.

3493641,4,B001BKLCCS,"This documentary is very nicely made, and certainly tugs at the heartstrings with it's insightful and heart- centered profiles of
the people involved in an experiment with dietary healing for diabetes.  For that reason, and with my forthcoming point of view in mind,
I would recommend that anyone interested in knowing something more (but certainly not the ""last word"") about how diet is ultra important
and foundational to the healing of any disease, see this movie.

  However- and this is a big however- ALL OF THESE PEOPLE would have improved and gotten well with wholesome, food-portioned, whole
foods nourishing diets of other kinds.  If I could BOLD THIS, and underline it, I would.

And in fact, it is possible they would not
have lost the one participant (out of 6), nor would the other participant have felt the need to hitchhike to MEXICO to drink tequila if they
were not subjected to a raw vegan diet. Additionally, two of the women who were profiled at the end as ""keeping off most of the weight""-
that comment raised the red flag that these already very overweight women gained some weight back.  This was likely because this raw vegan
diet journey was not one they could stick to for the long term, as many cannot- but moreover, they really were not well prepared for a
reasonable transition and maintenance lifestyle outside of that narrow realm.

Cooked food is not the bad guy.  Animal foods are not ""bad guys"". Processed, industrial commercial food products are the bad guys.
 Cholesterol is not a ""bad"" substance.
That said, ALL OF THESE people clearly needed the controls of supervised dietary healing for a period of time, in this case
30 days.  In this study, they had just that, and they experienced very measurable and wonderful healing.  My point is that viewers may
go away from this dvd thinking that it was solely the raw vegan diet that can accomplish this, and this simply isn't true.

  They would have done just fine on a ""Paleo"" diet, or with the inclusion of raw milk, raw dairy, grass fed pastured meat, eggs, and
butter.  Certainly Every OPTIMAL diet should include some raw foods , although cooked foods are also wholesome and nutritious.  In many
ways this felt like a vanity project for (let's just say) the Tree of Life Center.  I want to conclude that I am extremely familiar
with this type of diet, from many sides of the fence, and extremely familiar with this issue of dietary and natural healing.  See the
dvd by all means, get inspired, try raw foods, but don't think you have to force yourself onto a path of restrictive eating to heal
and find health.  I suggest the books ""Nourishing Traditions"", Deep Nutrition (Shanahan) , and Wheat Belly as additional sources of
dietary healing for diabetes and other chronic diseases- and as balancing viewpoints.",1356566400,6,2802,4.785862785862786
3493642,5,B001BKLCCS,"I give this video 5 stars not because of it's great production value or great story, but
because it clearly demonstrates that this country, which is facing a greater fight
in diabetes than any other ""terrorist"" threat, doesn't have to deteriorate to it's demise.
Several people with diabetes are removed to the desert where they can't
access the kind of food they usually eat, and within 30 days their blood sugar is normal
and they are off insulin and other medications.

 This is accomplished by their eating only raw food.  You know, food.  One man, an American Indian, can't make it through
the month.  He says ""God doesn't want me to eat this food."" You know, vegetables. And

The message of hope that the video contains and the touching authenticity of all the 'actors' (particularly the 'participants' in the 30 Day Raw experiment)won over the audience.

Six strangers are asked to embark on a plant-based, raw diet for 30 days, and under a care of a medical doctor, stop their diabetic medications. Their stories are touching, inspiring, and ultimately prove that good nutrition works.

Naysayers will argue that such a small number of cases is not enough to discredit the traditional treatment, but this film shows that alternatives should be offered to those afflicted with chronic diseases, and diabetes in particular. What strikes me as the most true is Morgan Spurlock (yes, the guy who directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Super-Size-Me/dp/B0002OXVBO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Super Size Me</a>) saying that most people wait until too late to change their die. Why not make the switch now to prevent diseases? why wait until one is afflicted with heart disease, diabetes, cancer, etc.

3493670,3,B001BKLCCS,"I came across this video at my beloved Seattle Public Library. I have been surrounded by diabetics my whole life; my father died from a heart attack most likely linked to complications from type-2 diabetes. He would have been very similar to the bulk of the participants featured in this documentary. Shockingly, my seemingly healthy 33-year-old husband was also diagnosed as a diabetic about 5 years ago, but he is a type-1 a.k.a. insulin-dependent ""juvenile"" diabetic. Since my husband's diagnosis I have taken it upon myself to seek out potential alternatives to his current regimen of oral medication and insulin. Though he has been seeing a top-rated endocrinologist since we moved to Seattle, they were incredibly aggressive in treating him with medication rather than helping to make him aware of dietary considerations/supplements that could at least postpone the onset of the numerous health complications that accompany the disease. This is particularly important to us as he is a military officer and his job is at risk due to his condition, so I really have read up on potential cures/remedies.

The premise of this film is to take 6 diabetics of all backgrounds from across the country and put them on a strict raw-vegan 30-day diet at a retreat in Arizona to improve their blood sugar and overall health. I know that the raw food movement is gaining speed and I commend the notion of eating more pure, clean foods. I'm not even opposed to the idea of becoming a vegetarian myself but the type-2 diabetics featured in this film I give about a 5% chance of sustaining such diets based on their lifestyle prior to the film. Obviously they would experience a drastic change in their overall health when one of them used to sustain herself on Cheese Nips and desserts before converting to this raw lifestyle. I liken this film to Morgan Spurlock's documentary ""Super Size Me"" (which is also mentioned in this film), only the opposite--of course if you eat fast food all day everyday, it will have detrimental health effects, that is not a shocker of cinema.  So if you go from the largely processed standard American diet to one of vegetables and seeds, it's not shocking that your health would improve.  I just don't think this film convinced me that you have to be raw in order to improve your health; why not simply vegetarian, or vegan (advocated by Dr. Neal Barnard) or low-carb (advocated by Dr. Richard K. Bernstein, a long-living type-1 diabetic)?

I personally prefer Dr. Howard Shapiro's approach of having a food pyramid based on vegetables, proteins from legumes and soy products, complex grains, fruits and healthy fats/oils. This documentary gives little to no advice for diabetics watching the film aside from its ""eat raw"" mantra. It would be nice if they gave a detailed dietary regimen and alternatives as well as recipes and other resources on how to transition from the standard American diet to a raw diet (or at least, a more sustainable diet for diabetics) so that the average diabetic doesn't go into ""food shock"" where they fall off the wagon within a few days much as one of the participants in the film did.  Also, to say that ""Participant X's blood sugar dropped 200 points from day 1 to day 30 on no meds"" is misleading--blood sugar is constantly rising and falling.  Give me the results of their Hemoglobin A1C three months later and then I might be impressed.

Second, the film focuses very little on exercise as a proponent for diabetic health. Sure, they do a little yoga/meditating but nothing cardiovascular aside from taking short walks (which are obviously good, but could be improved upon).

From personal experience with my husband's condition, we have found that meals with legumes/beans and complex carbs have the most profound effect on lowering his sugar. That and having a lot more muscle mass have kept his blood sugar down considerably this past year alone.

I will commend the film for its message that you don't have to approach the disease as all Western medicine has and for inspiring these individuals to lead more healthful lifestyles. It clearly had some psychological benefit to most of the participants who felt rejuvenated and less condemned by their condition.  I just think its principle message, ""go raw or go home"" is a little misleading and doesn't fully encapsulate the potential remedies for the disease.

Oh, and just as an aside and personal pet peeve:  Dr. Cousens, if you want to be taken seriously, lose the hat.",1285113600,21,4489,4.8921052631578945
3493671,3,B001BKLCCS,"I was really excited when I finally bought this DVD, so it is very disheartening that I had to give this a 3 star rating. I have been wanting to watch this for almost 2 years now. At the time I was a vegetarian w/ diabetes, and assumed it might have been over my head. Now, as a raw vegan (w/o diabetes), many thanks to Gabriel, I thought this would be a great compliment to what I already know and practice. My goal was learn to some hard facts/information, recipes, be entertained, and have a staple DVD I could share with others. Unfortunately, I did not obtain any of these, and I am very easy to please.
For $30 after shipping I really expect alot more than what I recieved. The Dvd was presently nicely in a thin case and appealing cover. The start of the actual DVD was quite good and eye catching, but once the actual movie/documentary began I was often found myself struggling to pay attention (and I just had a green smoothie!!!! so I was wide awake). The guest speakers that were advertised were 10 second clips from OTHER movies. I found this really disingenious and quite lazy. Gabriel has the ""star power"" in the Raw Vegan world to get real interviews, not rip off clips from other dvds.
The documentary itself was okay, but after watching a trailer on youtube I wasn't presented with anything that I hadnt already seen or envisioned. Even if I were to watch this when I still had diabetes, I might have been mildly more pleased. I don't want to critize this too much more, because the message is great and they were probably working with a limited budget. Although, no matter how much I try I can not reccommend this movie. I would return it, but I decided to donate it to someone at work with diabetes for free.",1279584000,41,1727,4.4

I juiced for about a year and changed my vision for the better according to my doctor.  He asked me what happened such that I improved my vision.  I told him I started juicing. He was impressed because he said it was a significant change. I also lost 40lbs and had difficulty getting into my savings account at the bank because the teller said the women on the license was much older and I was much younger.  The manager had to be called and they held me for over an hour until they could verify it was me.  When I got home I looked at the old photo and it did not look like me anymore.  I also reversed many other problems through raw food and organic foods.  Everyone thinks I had a makeover.  It's just diet and exercise.",1279152000,26,1010,4.208333333333333
3493673,3,B001BKLCCS,"This is a good film to show that the raw food diet is a good way to help your body heal when it is sick and then transition into a healthier lifestyle (that doesn't need to be 100% raw).

However, before you watch this film, do some research about what diabetes is. The difference between type 1 and type 2. Stuff like that. The film gives a bit of information, but they tell it to you just as you're asking ""Uhm... what exactly does that mean?""

I liked how they filmed some of the recipes. I mean, you're not watching this film to see raw recipes, but its nice that they showed you a bit of it. I wish there were more scenes of everyone eating and the choices they made. There's a scene with them in a grocery store, but it would be cool to see what they choose to eat for breakfast or lunch.

I also would like to know who all the people are. Sometimes someone comes on the screen and you don't know who it is. You just assume that they are the camp chef or the counselour or something, but a simple ""name | position"" at the left hand corner of the screen would have been good enough.

But anyway, the message of this film is clear. And its good to see with your OWN eyes what raw food can do. I give it 4 star because of the execution. Some editting issues. Stuff like that. I mean, I wouldn't pay $20 or however much the DVD costs because of the film quality. The DVD doesn't look like it was produced with stuff that's worth paying to see it. I could have easily made this documentary on my own with my camera and imovie.

EDIT: After watching more documentaries, I must give this a lower rating. Because this documentary is incredibly boring. It is really hard to pay attention and after expanding my knowledge of these types of films, I've seen how informative and entertaining a good documentary can be. This documentary just seems very amateur-ly made.
As for educationally, there is a bit lacking here. I wish there were more details about their life AFTER this. I wonder if they waited a bit longer to release the DVD if they would have found more relapses. Also, after reading the 80/10/10 diet book, I wish the DVD was a bit more informative.

Ironically I found this after I had done about 40 days of a 90% raw diet for myself after not getting anywhere with my blood sugar for 7 months.  Raw food has helped me overcome adrenal fatigue and prevent using insulin.  I wish I had seen the movie when I started my diet, that would have been fun! Anyhow, I have to eat this way or go on insulin, but I'm so happy because it's the real way to eat, everything just falls into place. If I have to be on a diet, then this is the best one to be on.  I highly recommend this movie to anyone struggling with diabetes type 1 or 2.  Type 1 will usually make great improvements and some will completely reverse it, but not everyone.

The group they chose were the last people I'd expect to warm up to the idea of this AZ raw foodie hippie type of lifestyle but they did and they all had heart and I could just see them glow after the first week.  I was so happy for them. OH geez I think I'm gonna cry again. Anyways, thanks for making the movie, it really confirms what I have been trying to do but had no support for.

The film does prove that eating raw clean foods will drastically improve their blood sugar levels but the participants seem to barely care. They are more excited about going home and its almost a guarantee that all but maybe 2 of them went right back to eating crap and taking insulin. The film doesnt go into enough detail about what they were eating and recipes and so on. Everyones  constant whining and the pissing away an opportunity is all you will remember.

I want to show this to my diabetic friends but am concerned they will be put off by the touchy/feely (""corny""???) aspects, the brief cameos by people like Anthony Robbins, the stress that shocking dietary changes will be demanded, and the suspicion that maybe it is an infomercial for the ""camp"" they attend in Arizona.

Again, it's a fabulous message that diabetes can be cured, but I don't think that I can convince any diabetic friend to watch this through. The emotional tone will appeal to some people and repulse others.

But do not be put off by this review! Watch it anyway because it may save the life of a loved one!

There are no recipes, no ""How-To"" in this DVD. It simply introduces the concept so that you can research it further yourself.

UPDATE OCT 2013: For any diabetic (actually for anyone who eats) I strongly suggest watching the documentary Forks Over Knives and then reading the book that inspired it, The China Study. It is well known that type II diabetes can usually be cured and type I diabetes better managed by following a whole-plant-foods diet--which also slows cancer growth and reverses cardiovascular disease.

UPDATE MAY 2014: Read The End of Diabetes by Dr Joel Fuhrman!!! I now believe that type II diabetes is merely a symptom of an underlying dietary misunderstanding. Don't mask the symptom with medication, but solve the problem with diet (and find a doctor who agrees that it is possible).",1256947200,18,1622,4.73404255319149
3493678,4,B001BKLCCS,This was a great DVD!  I recommend it highly for anyone who is struggling with Diabetes or who wants to change their life from unhealthy to happy and healthy.,1255392000,4,158,4.448275862068965
3493679,5,B001BKLCCS,"I saw this documentary showing advertised at a local health food store. I wasn't able to attend. I have family with diabetes and I've been a sugar binger with weight and energy problems in the past. I purchased this from Amazon and my husband and I watched this at home. It was amazing. We didn't blink an eye through the whole thing. At the end we were empowered to take charge of our own health. We immediately started reading labels and avoiding additives, eating more raw veggies, fruits, nuts and other nutritious whole foods and feeling more energetic and downright great. My husband just lost 36 pounds on a diet plan that didn't really include healthy food. I think we will both be in a lot better shape and healthier from watching this and he will be able to maintain his weight easier.  It feels great to feel great!  I've sent it to my diabetic family members who have never been advised on diet, but have been on pharmaceuticals for years to control their symptoms. I know this will change their lives.",1254614400,6,1014,4.565934065934066

8283383,1,B001BKLCCS,"This is nothing but a series of anecdotal followings with no information of substance. I had hoped for some instructions on how to follow the meal plan, well a few?...one? ZERO.

This is nothing but an advertisement for an Arizona health spa and the title and come-on gives false hope that the DVD contains anything useful.

While the concept may be good, the DVD is worthless and so far overpriced, it borders on fraud.

I have never been as disappointed in a purchase as I am this one. At least I only wasted $25 on it from another site (same DVD).",1444262400,4,550,4.425742574257426
8283384,2,B001BKLCCS,"I found this documentary very troubling.  While it is true, I'm sure, that such a diet could ""cure"" most cases of diabetes, mainly through radical weight loss and fiber uptake, I think that the subject people of this 30 day retreat were all people that came from family backgrounds that would make it nearly impossible for someone to stay on this diet once they got back home--many of them had obese family members with bad dietary habits--too much fat, refined carbs, sugar, etc.--and backsliding would probably be the first thing that would happen.  Someone like actor Woody Harrelson, who appears briefly in the movie, could probably maintain this life because his home environment supports it.  But these same results--the subjects getting off insulin, lowering blood sugar and bp, losing weight--could also come from the Paleo Diet, or Macrobiotics, or a more standard vegan or vegetarian diet that featured cooked foods.  It all seems a little cultish, and Dr. Cousens although he has MD's on his staff, seems a little too guru-ey to me.",1443744000,2,1043,5.011560693641618
8283385,5,B001BKLCCS,"I personally do not suffer with diabetes but have friends and family who do. After watching this extraordinary documentary I alerted and or bought copies for all of my friends and family, diabetic or not. This DVD changed my life. After watching how it changed the lives of the participants, I went 100% to a vegan diet and have never felt better, I have more energy than I did when I was twenty but the most astonishing thing that I  have experienced...all of my arthritic symptoms have disappeared. My skin glows, my hair is shiny and healthy. I feel like a different person because I have lived with chronic pain most of my adult life. No more!  I wish everyone would watch this. Just think of all the things one can do when not in pain not to mention the money one can save !",1439942400,7,779,4.36551724137931
