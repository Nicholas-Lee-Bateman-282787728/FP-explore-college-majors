3880548,4,B0029QUEU4,"Yeah, this concert seems a little slow, especially in this f'd up age of living second to second, mtv b.s.  These guys never wanted to or pretended to be Paul Stanley & Gene Simmons.  If you don't like Trower or Cream don't buy this!  But if you like great freak'n music played by consummate professionals, then by all means buy this.  I own over 400 concerts on DVD and this on fits in just fine, I would buy it again in a second if I lost it, and that's about as good as any music DVD gets.

Peace, Out!",1256688000,7,505,4.0606060606060606
3880549,3,B0029QUEU4,"I think one of the problems with this DVD is the mix. I've only listened to it in 5.1, but the mix is a little too ""nice"". Instead of having the instruments up loud, the vocal dominates the mix. The issue I have with that is that the bass is mixed way down and as a result it doesn't sound full. I think if the drums, bass and guitar were up with the vocals it would be a lot more enjoyable. As it is it sounds fairly stark. This is sort of surprising since the studio CD was mixed a lot better.

Sure Jack Bruce, especially, is showing his age, but what he is playing is good. What Trower is playing is also good. Gary Husband is good, but doesn't seem to be as forceful as needed. Maybe it just wasn't their best night. I was also disappointed by the lack of older Bruce/Trower material; it would have been a lot better than Bruce's Cream hits, which were competantly done, but what's the point.

Having said that there's several nice moments on the DVD and if you're a fan of Bruce or Trower there's enough to like to buy this. If you're a casual Trower fan, then the Living Out of Time Live DVD is a better choice. For Jack Bruce fans, if you don't have the Cream reunion DVD get that first.",1255651200,8,1195,4.124463519313305
3880550,4,B0029QUEU4,"ALERT!!!The previous review is just absurd! 2 stars?! Why bother giving two? What are those 2 for anyway?...These guys have always been about subtelty, not bombast! The songs are intended to be minimalist in structure. Can you not see and hear how into it they are??? To say Jack Bruce's vocals are ""weak"" is also bizarre. ""CARMEN"" is amazing vocally!! Who pray-tell would sing this any better?..Jack Bruce is incredible! He is pitch-perfect.  Gary Husband is an amazing drummer and a wonderful choice here.(talk about the details! GREAT IS A DRUMMER WHO CAN DEAL WITH MINIMALISM WHILE MAINTAINING SUCH DYNAMICS!  If you are a Trower, or Jack Bruce fan this is a must!

The only reason this gets 4 stars is because I find the guitar a bit too low/dry/ & subdued in the mix!!  It's unusually clean and may be just the way the DVD/performance was recorded. Usually Trower's guitar is right on the edge of feedback. So, I would liked to have seen the mix a tad more vibrant, louder, especially on the guitar & bass side. Having said that, recording a live performance DVD is tricky thing. There are allot of ""funny things"" going on in the post- production stage of supposedly live DVD's these days, and this one, while being a bit ""dry"",  is refreshingly true to the performance. Nice camera work and angles. Good lighting as well!

 Unfortunately, there are no ""extras"" on this dvd which is a shame. Would love to have seen some interviews! So 4 stars for lack of extras.. and a bit too dry mix-wise. The performances are killer! 5 STARS FOR PERFORMANCE!

How can anyone not be happy to have this? Trower never was a big commercial success and to have a DVD with Jack Bruce at all is a total gift! I have seen Trower recently and to say he is somehow getting worse with age is completely inaccurate and unfair to the truth. Like Beck, Trower is one of the very few who is getting better , not worse with age!  What a shame to kick ofF this great product availablilty with such a lame and inaccurate review!""

3880551,2,B0029QUEU4,"This is disapointing. Its sad to see your heroes age. Of course aging is no sin, and of course inevitable, yet seeing and hearing the weak vocals dirge-like tempos and generally lackluster performance underscores the sad reality. There is no spark and no joy in this concert, and the songs, the new ones are feeble. The old warhorses, just, depressing. Trower attempts to breathe some life but ultimately it all falls dreadfully flat. A real drag man.",1255305600,5,451,4.87012987012987
3880552,5,B0029QUEU4,Classic rock performed by consummate musicians. Focus of DVD was on muscicians as well. Would recommend to all classic rock fans.,1368144000,,129,5.190476190476191
3880553,5,B0029QUEU4,"This is a stellar performance...I absolutely LOVE their ""Seven Moons"" record, so I was excited to have the opportunity to see many of those tracks performed live (if the Trower/Bruce collaboration interests you, I encourage you to read my review of ""Seven Moons""). The music sounds amazing...this is a true power trio, with plenty of soulful energy pouring from the stage...however, I will say that I do not love the film editing, with the camera wandering off in various directions during Trower's solos, too little camera time for the excellent Gary Husband, etc. Be that as it may, it is beautifully shot and the sound is good as well.",1367193600,,638,4.862385321100917
3880554,1,B0029QUEU4,Jack Bruce is really out of tune at this age but Robin is still great. Bruce is just not how I remember him.,1366329600,,108,3.739130434782609
3880555,5,B0029QUEU4,"This DVD is a live 2009 concert with Jack Bruce, Robin Trower and drummer Gary Husband performing the material on the studio version of Bruce & Trower's Seven Moons CD, along with some material from Jack Bruce's days with Cream.

Great stuff. This performance ranks alongside the best material Jack Bruce and Robin Trower have done individually and collectively over the decades.

There's nothing fancy about the performance. There are no ostentatious theatrics or staging. This is just three first rate musicians performing some great new material along with covers of Politician and Sunshine of Your Love, both Jack Bruce compositions from his days with Cream.

My only criticism of this album is that I would have liked to hear this band cover some of the early Robin Trower classics like Day of the Eagle and Too Rolling Stoned along with the covers of Cream material.

But that's a really minor issue.

For fans of Cream and of Robin Trower, you won't be disappointed with this DVD. I highly recommend it.",1295308800,7,1010,4.883040935672515
3880556,5,B0029QUEU4,"Excellent performances of songs from the ""Seven Moons"" album, Cream staples and Carmen from Trower & Bruce's first outing: BLT. Yes, Jack Bruce looks weathered, but what does it matter when the playing and music are this good? Jack's voice is still strong and he looks really happy to be playing on stage. Robin is obviously enjoying himself all through and his solo on White Room alone is worth the price of admission. Robin's playing continues to be very soulful and captivating. Gary Husband lends excellent support on drums. With such great music and playing by all three musicians, this is a DVD that fans will find themselves going back to, again and again. Great camera work as well, capturing the interplay between the musicians on stage.",1290556800,3,746,4.881889763779528
3880557,3,B0029QUEU4,"I love Jack Bruce and Robin Trower but this is not a good performance.
I like their CD of this band project, but the live performance made me nod off.
Jack and Robin are just getting too old to give a live ""Rock"" performance.
Audibly their work is still good, but I do not see the reason for a live concert or
live DVD video.",1279152000,,325,4.015384615384615
3880558,4,B0029QUEU4,"I gave this 4 stars because the production quality was a tad cheapish, but that detracts very little from what 64 yr. old Trower and 62 yr. old Bruce laid down in this performance.  For a couple of old farts, these guys ROCK!!!  White Room, Sunshine of Your Love, and other Cream tunes mix in perfectly with newer work from the (also 4 star, same reason) studio version of Seven Moons.",1267920000,,385,4.408450704225352
3880559,4,B0029QUEU4,"Like many, I thought that Robin Trower got back together with Jack Bruce in order to produce a cheap payday capitalizing on past glories.  After all, even the song titles were rip-offs of old stuff, right?

Well, I was wrong.  Instead of a jaded, pale imitation of what used to be, like most rockers past their prime produce, this is actually a heartening reminder that talent and true greatness stand the test of time.  I will readily agree that Trower and Bruce are not going to win any beauty contests these days; it's actually kind of heartbreaking to see how they've aged.

But, DESPITE the ravages of time, Bruce can still produce jewels like ""Just Another Day"", which is just as good as anything on his masterwork, ""Harmony Row"".  And Robin Trower plays ridiculously well for a sixty-four year old. He plays the Cream classic songs effortlessly, but he really shines on the new stuff like ""Seven Moons"", ""So Far to Yesterday"", and ""The Last Door"".

In the final analysis, there aren't that many rock musicians that you can classify as ""significantly creative artists"".  But these are two such musicians, from a generation that lifted rock music toward respectability.

Look at the people Bruce has worked with: John McLaughlin, Tony Williams, Eric Clapton, Ginger Baker, Chris Spedding, Gary Moore, Carla Bley, Frank Zappa.  Jack has the kind of musical intelligence that transcends genres.  Trower has the flowing style of soloing that can remind you of a jazz saxophonist, and he is never anything less than tasteful.

So my advice is to get past the wrinkles, and enjoy the music.  Jazz player Roland Kirk kept playing after debilitating strokes.  Johnny Cash still commanded respect when he was frail of health.

Just be glad that these guys are still around, still creative, still sharing their gifts.  What they're doing, in the face of a music industry that only loves pretty faces, is nothing short of HEROIC.

*** 2015 addition:  I am sorry to note that of the two musicians, Jack Bruce no longer is with us.  Trower is still steaming along, although his wife passed. I hope everyone appreciates the ""precious gift"" of music that these artists pass along to us.",1258675200,30,2177,4.850948509485095
3880560,4,B0029QUEU4,"Jack Bruces' style and panache  persuaded me to take up bass in 1974. I've followed his performances since the ""How's Tricks"" tour and own most of his releases, on vinyl,CD and VHS. In my opinion the ""Seven Moons"" CD is his best recorded performance, with inciteful lyrics, a smooth,fat bass sound and perfect production. While I would have preferred to see this band live, I was relieved to hear it would be released on DVD.

I find Robin Trowers' music somewhat hypnotic having seen him twice in the last few years but playing with Jack Bruce causes him to ""take it up a notch"". Their two previous collaborations ""BLT"" and ""Truce"" were entertaining. He was obviously having fun here!

Gary Husband is one of the most lyrical drummers playing today.

The sound is quite good,as is the camera work. I wish they had kept to their shared work rather than including Cream tunes. The only reason I couldn't give this DVD 5 stars is that Mr. Bruce is really showing his age. The passion is still there but the fire doesn't burn as brightly. I can understand his possible inability to tour extensively. Sadly this fate awaits us all, and should remind us to ejoy all we can while we can!

3880561,4,B0029QUEU4,"Even though I already owned the studio CD of Seven Moons since its release a couple of years ago, I was delighted to hear that a live performance of the album was being released on DVD. So I ordered it as soon as I got word it was available. What's the verdict? Its a solid performance...
On this DVD, ten songs from the album, three Cream songs, and one other are presented. And while Jack Bruce doesn't sound exactly as he did in his days with Cream, he hasn't strayed far. As for Robin Trower, well he is just superb. One of the joys of seeing Trower live is the amusement one gets from watching his facial contortions while he plays. Backing Trower and Bruce is the steady, skillful drum work of Gary Husband.
My favorites on the DVD differ slightly from what I like best on the studio album. They are Seven Moons, Lives of Clay, Distant Places of the Heart, The Last Door, the exquisite Carmen, and two old Cream songs, Sunshine of Your Love and Politician. And while there are no ""extras"", what is here gives the viewer plenty of value for money.
Don't pay any attention to the naysayers. If you like Trower and especially if you like Jack Bruce, you are going to enjoy Seven Moons Live. Order it while its cheap, you won't be sorry.",1257033600,4,1239,4.367965367965368
8358118,5,B0029QUEU4,Excellent concert DVD. To see Trower and Bruce doing Seven Moons (which was a fantastic CD) live was great. Definitely worth while!,1490572800,,131,5.0
8358119,5,B0029QUEU4,"Two of my favorite musicians together again making music together (along with the multi-talented Gary Husband on the drum kit) I still mourn the loss of the great Jack Bruce every day, but this concert from a few years back gives me a taste of the masters at work. The Seven Moons album is their best collaboration, IMHO, and to see the joy in their eyes as they are playing is priceless. Highly recommended for any music fan.",1440633600,,426,4.4743589743589745

8358121,5,B0029QUEU4,Yes we all miss James Dewar and we have to accept that Jack Bruce is nearly 70 and just doesn't sing like a 20 year old anymore- but none of us do! But the playing is superb and has an intimate feel without overly busy or artsy camera work. Sound quality is very good. Drumming by Gary Talent is also excellent; much of the material is from the Seven Moons record and there are gems from previous Trower/Bruce collaborations. Overall a thoroughly entertaining performance and nice to see 'senior' musicians still showing more chops than most pop tarts of today can dream of :-),1393804800,,577,4.5576923076923075
8358122,5,B0029QUEU4,"Jack Bruce and Robin Trower collaborated in the early 1980s, and again in 2008-9 with the Seven Moons album and concert dates. They are natural allies, in that they both can render a brawny, blues-y rock sound that appeals to both heart and brain.  Inevitably, this trio will be compared to Cream, but drummer Gary Husband is more straight-ahead than Ginger Baker was, although he has an excellent command of dynamics.  Robin Trower's mature guitar style owes a little less to Hendrix than the 1970s recordings did, and he certainly tries to maintain his own distinct phrasing, even on the 3 Cream covers.

I guess some people might feel the energy level is lower than the hey-day of the late 1960s -  early 1970s, but I hear a more mature group of musicians who know how to pace the music and how to deliver a tune.  They are less concerned with ""rockin' the house"" than they are on playing well, and to me, this comes across more as a smoldering intensity that occasionally erupts, than it does a fireworks show.

The bulk of the set is material from the Seven Moons CD, and on these, Bruce and Trower meet as something close to equal collaborators, at least as far as the arrangements go.  The tunes are mostly atmospheric and dynamic, not always blues in form, but very much blues-flavored.  Trower plays with characteristic nuance and expressiveness, but with even more subtlety than he had in the 1970s.  He struggles a bit to find his comfort zone on the Cream covers, but the audience's enthusiasm for the most classic of classic rock buoys them up. There's a moment in ""Politician,"" early in Robin's solo, where the invisible thought balloon over his head must have read, ""Oh hell, this is just blues; I'm just gonna play some blues!""

Jack Bruce retains all of his bass skill, though there's never any ostentatious skill display here.  He does play more than a few lines that defy the usual bass cliches, and of course, he reprises several signature bass riffs right where you'd expect to hear them.  Most listeners will notice that Bruce's voice has faded a bit from the glory days, but he's largely intact, even if he has had to dial back on his range and projection.  He struggles to render ""Carmen,"" the falsetto approach long gone, but still, he captures that tune's feeling of longing.  The band's command of dynamics really helps.  They give Bruce the space he needs to sing, then swell up the sound around the verses.

Audio is fine. My only complaint is that the editing is a little more jump-cut than it should have been.  I guess they want to use all of the camera angles they have, or maybe they want to keep guitarists from copping Robin's licks, but I think they should have focused more on whoever's doing the top line (i.e.: vocal or guitar solo), rather than cutting away to long shots or audience reaction shots so frequently.

This is a decent film of a great concert event, featuring a band of journeymen that delivers a mature, expansive version of blues-rock.",1392508800,2,2991,4.653992395437262
8358123,5,B0029QUEU4,"Robin Trower is my favorite guitarist/songwriter, and to see him play live with Jack Bruce (Cream) and Gary Husband (Level 42) on a collection of ""Seven Moons"", ""BLT"", etc., as well as some of Cream's greatest hits is an amazingly satisfying experience. This DVD sounds fantastic on my home theater system, and the visuals are superlative. The ""only"" disappointment I had with this great concert is that the camera work was not choreographed very well. A lot of time is spent on faces, long shots, and wide-zoom, but I would have liked to have seen more fretboard action by the legendary fingers of both Bruce and Trower, as well as some actual drumming by Husband (who is outstanding - absolutely out of this world). Otherwise, a concert worth watching over and over again...",1389571200,,776,4.842105263157895
8358124,4,B0029QUEU4,"I like Bruce/Trower (Trower/Buce?) projects because you get Trower songs with Jack Bruce bass/vocals, and you get Bruce songs with Trower guitar.  It's a win-win.

As a drummer, I didn't like the sound of the band, maybe it was just me, but I was very dissappointed with this dvd. Living out of Time is much more like the sound I expect from Robin Trower.

8358127,5,B0029QUEU4,"It took almost 40 years for an individual to finally get the music of Robin Trower on a professionally filmed DVD and we have Thomas Ruf to thank for this . I plan on buying more Ruf products because of this although I don't know him or anyone at Ruf Records . I'm just a fan of Robins music ( and Amazon customer ) and very pleased that this is available for us to enjoy. Three world class musicians who created a fine album of all original material and did a short tour of Europe where it was filmed .
Disregard some of the other reviewer comments like "" Gee, these guys are old ""  Duh , yes they are approaching 70, but still dynamic and creating wonderful music to enjoy. Segovia didn't quit when he was fifty years old and neither should they . Forget the nitpicking also , this was filmed on the first night they played live and there are no patch-in-overs , auto-tuning , canned midi music etc. like so many other artists do now .And we're lucky to see and hear it even if we couldn't be there.
As noted by others the guitar is a little bit low in the mix but the playing is wonderful. Make sure you set the sound choices properly at setup , if it's set to surround on your 2 channel system the guitar will sound pretty banjoey.
I bought the live CD also .",1370044800,3,1263,4.134146341463414
