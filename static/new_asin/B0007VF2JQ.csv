8052269,4,B0007VF2JQ,"If you love indy and weird you'll love this!
Can't really categorize it. It's an odd horror/mystery/psycho-drama with a wacky ending. I like indy films with unexpected plots so this was right up m alley... Not for everyone though...",1441411200,,232,4.9743589743589745
8052270,4,B0007VF2JQ,"Sometimes, when scrolling through the endless wasteland of horror movies and refusing to sit through another tv-ready cast of teenagers snarking and shrieking at cliche-X, you take a gamble on something you've never heard of and get lucky.  Sure, the whole film strains under its low-budget but this seems to be a case where the filmmakers chose to compensate for these shortcomings by focusing on pacing and a subtle narrative; I actually feel the film was at its weakest when mimicking some been-there done-that imagery.  What you end up with is a creepy little story told with almost no dialog that centers around a *gasp* elderly man living alone in the woods.

Certainly, this isn't for everyone - Transformers and Hostel babies will no doubt be texting within minutes - but patient horror fans will find something to like here.",1309910400,2,833,4.935714285714286
8052271,1,B0007VF2JQ,Not more than 12 words spoken during the entire movie.  Absolutely a nothing of a movie.  Do not waste your time.  Junk,1308528000,,119,4.318181818181818
8052272,1,B0007VF2JQ,"The only conclusion I can come to is that the other reviewers here are friends and relatives of the director, because this stupid amateurish movie is like a bad student film, and I can't believe I actually spent money on it. The cheesey special effects are just thrown in senselessly (a little dead girl jerking and spasming around everwhere) because the director has seen this particular thing in about a hundred other horror films from the last decade and obviously liked it. Ridiculous.",1284249600,,489,4.903614457831325
8052273,5,B0007VF2JQ,"That the protagonist of this extraordinary independent film is elderly, alone and isolated turns out to be a dividing point for viewers who want to see nubile teens mutilated ad nauseum. Director J. T. Petty knew what he wanted to do even in college when he made this film. It's what hardcore connoisseurs of horror look for: respectful of the genre, well-made (within a rigorously limited budget) and surprising. Emerging from a noir sensibility, it's a unique and worthwhile contribution.",1261612800,,490,5.1375
8052274,4,B0007VF2JQ,"If you are here reading my review but haven't actually seen the movie yet...please take the plunge and buy it, rent it, or borrow it! This is a great movie for horror/suspense/mystery fans. The movie has a certain creepy atmosphere that money just can't buy. The concept is pretty simple and there isn't much new here (excluding the very end!) but the movie itself  keeps the viewer interested.

  'Soft For Digging' does what much more lavish and expensive films, with some exceptions,  fail to do...keep you on the edge of your seat and leave you feeling satisfied.

  The film does have it's less than stellar moments, but i would have to say that they are few and far between. most importantly, they don't take away from the overall uneasiness and almost unbearable tension which make up the fabric of the film.

  Thumbs up and enjoy!",1119052800,11,839,4.7172413793103445
8052275,5,B0007VF2JQ,"I am lucky enough to have seen this creepy, weird, almost-silent film before. Using strong images and heavy atmosphere, JT Petty creates a mystery that will keep you covering your eyes and wanting to keep watching.

Not your average horror movie, this one depends on what your imagination is capable of filling in alongside some pretty creepy images.

Highly recommended.",1113436800,8,371,5.166666666666667
