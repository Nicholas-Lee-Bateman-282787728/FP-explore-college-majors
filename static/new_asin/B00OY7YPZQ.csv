6775857,1,B00OY7YPZQ,"The acting here is adequate,  actually.  But it's difficult to understand how the writer/ director received funding, or was told that he could direct (A bigwig UK studio exec as a parent?). This is 98% a ""talking heads"" / full of exposition script with absolutely no terror or horror--at all. The first five minutes include a cheesy,  bad 90s band music video (I'm not kidding)....The first interior scene between the protagonists looks as if it was filmed on a sound stage with one central floodlight on the two characters....there are 2 scenes where the boom mic appears in frame...a cameraman's reflection appears...a light mirror is evident in a porch scene...if it were fast-paced & cheeky, then perhaps it could've been a purposeful parody...but it's not.  I do feel badly for the two leads as they both seem to have some acting talent,  but Andrew Jones is terrible at both writing and directing. It feels like the first film of a first year undergraduate film student. Just so, so, so bad--but not bad enough to be ""kitschy"", & never, ever scary. How did this get any type of distribution?  It pains me to think that this film is generating profit--especially when there are so many brilliant writers & directors struggling to get their work on the screen. Musical Score? Terrible. Character Development? Non -existent. Logic/ Continuity of Plot? I won't even dignify the question. Why and how and WTF?? I'd assume if one ""loves"" this film, & is no blood relation to cast or crew, this person probably lists Nickelback as his or her favorite band as well. And I just threw up in my mouth a little. Ah...too passionate about this, I realize. But don't waste your time.",1425254400,3,1675,4.798611111111111

6775859,2,B00OY7YPZQ,"This movie sounds muffled or muzzled, not sure of the right word, but the sound is very poor when it comes to dialogue between actors. The film's picture is great, but at best this is a low grade flick. I'm a big fan of haunted house movies, but I got suckered by this purchase and it's packaging.  It's not really a haunted house movie.  It's a slow suspense movie that I actually dozed off 3/4 the way through. It's a low budget euro flick.  A lot of stuff does not make sense.  Do not even rent, maybe check it out on your local TV station if available to help you with your insomnia.",1424649600,3,587,4.168141592920354
6775860,1,B00OY7YPZQ,"Just plain bad.  Period.  Nothing new, or original.  The acting is horrifying, there are no scares, and I simply couldn't care less what happened to any of the characters.  I really should have shut it off after the first 20 minutes.  I wouldn't bother with this one if I were you.",1424649600,3,281,4.431372549019608
6775861,3,B00OY7YPZQ,"John Davies (Lee Bane) writes horror stories and suffers from writer's block. He rents a large home and is informed by the owner that Agnes (Vivien Bridson) a blind woman lives up there. She ""stares"" out the window and never leaves her room...something that seems a bit impossible considering the nature of the human body. While here John meets Cassie (Georgina Blackledge) the neighbor and they become friends. Odd things happen in the house. The record player comes on by itself. Things move about. A bottle he found on the beach appears in the home. He is also having bad dreams.

The film builds up to a climax that was so-so. The special effects were simple to non-existent, but effective. The writing wasn't half bad, yet seemed to lack a few good scenes and one great scene to bring the film home. I did like the ending which leaves the viewer with two options.

Guide: 1 F-bomb that I recall. No sex or nudity.  Okay for a Redbox rental.",1424563200,4,945,4.579881656804734

8685292,1,B00OY7YPZQ,"Amazingly dull horror film about a screenwriter who rents a house to get away from the city and focus on something he is trying to write.  A mysterious old woman lives alone, locked in the attic but the man has the run of the lower two floors of the house.  At this early point how poorly thought out Last House on Cemetary Lane is already becomes obvious--the screenwriter never asks if there is another entrance to the attic, or if food is brought out to the old woman or anything--writer/director Andrew Jones never apparently gave ten seconds of thought to the practical implications of somebody living all alone, locked in the attic of a large house.  And for the record, nobody ever brings the old woman food and the screenwriter never stops and wonders how she manages to stay alive.

Things become tedious almost immediately when the screenwriter meets a pretty local woman and strikes up a friendship with her.  Last House on Cemetary Lane largely consists of dull dialogue scenes between those two characters.  Where is the horror, you might ask?  And what about the cemetery?  Well, there is no cemetery (unless I missed it) and the horror pretty much consists of another dull dialogue scene where the screenwriter finally meets the old woman in the attic and she tells him about something bad that happened in the house years earlier when her family lived on the lower floors.  We don't even get a flashback--just dialogue delivered in such a listless manner that the characters might as well be talking about the number of calories in a girl scout cookie.

Last House on Cemetery Lane is one of those very rare movies that has absolutely nothing to redeem it--the film is almost perverse in how little effort it actually puts into trying to scare the audience or generate a little suspense--the movie is just 90 worthless minutes of your life slowly ticking away, unless you have the sense to turn it off much sooner.",1463270400,,1930,4.7343283582089555
8685293,4,B00OY7YPZQ,This movie was ok. your average ghost/ horror movie. I'm glad i bought it though. it looks nicely added to my horror collection of movies. The cover to the movie is what sold me on the reason for buying it. It's a cool cover. I got it cheap too. I don't agree with other people's comments about The Man shower scene. So what? Women are always shown in the Shower in EVERY horror movie. For once give the ladies something. It's not like they showed his junk. I think it's ridiculous that people take showers in horror films anyways when you know there is a killer out there. Or in this case a ghost haunting you. Hollywood needs to stop being sexist.,1457308800,,649,4.327868852459017

8685296,4,B00OY7YPZQ,"a  good ghost story with an ample air of mystery and suspense; written and directed with a style faintly resembling some of the ghost stories from the turn of the century. Perhaps it's a European thing, I can't say with any certainty. It seems that every culture has it's own very distinct approach to the horror genre and they're all equally terrifying at their best.

it's very well cast and the plot is devoid of any poorly costumed creature features and cheap shock value scenes; the psychological element is very tangible and a welcome change to the usual indie B approach to campfire story telling.",1430352000,,604,4.742857142857143
8685297,2,B00OY7YPZQ,"Has all of the elements you wouldnt want in a horror movie: No scares, a love story, a slow paced storyline, a man-shower scene, and much, much more. This movie was just plain boring. Hard to watch and the twist(ish) at the end is not worth the 1h 40min ride. The word cemetery should be nowhere near this film!! This writer/director/producer would probably be great at making a romance film...",1430265600,2,394,4.642857142857143
8685298,2,B00OY7YPZQ,"The problem with this little flick: Nothing happens until the very last 10 minutes. Lots of talking, walking, more talking, a nightmare scene here and there then more talking then the Horror starts and it ends.",1428883200,4,210,4.861111111111111

8685301,3,B00OY7YPZQ,"Not as bad as some reviewers claim - this is a British film, and they tend to move slower, so if you need action-packed non-stop scares, this isn't it. Definitely a B movie, but I watched the whole thing and the twist at the end is nice. Watched it on Netflix and I suggest you do the same. Good for a rainy day.",1425600000,2,312,3.9682539682539684
