7854090,5,630364046X,"Great example of obscure Russian filmmaking from a specific window of time after the collapse of the USSR but before Russia's demise into Facism.  This is Russian filmmaking in the spirit of Almodovar during Spain's outbreak of democracy but in the Russian idiom: perhaps not as loud and in your face, but gritty nonetheless.  Good choreography at times.",1409097600,,354,5.086206896551724
7854091,4,630364046X,"""The Creation of Adam"" is bold by Russian film-making standards, due to its sympathetic treatment of homosexuality.  However, I think it's a mistake to label this a true Gay film.  Androgyny and reincarnation are the  dominant themes. The protagonist, Andrei, does not have any issues with his  heterosexuality although he certainly feels trapped in his toxic marriage  with Nina. And, in his bleak and unsuccessful life, he considers himself  unworthy of love, either from his shrewish wife or his adoring coworker  Natasha. In an early scene of the film, Andrei impulsively goes to the  defense of a young victim of a ""queer-bashing"".  Although this  incident is seemingly unrelated to the rest of the plot, it sets the stage:  we are made graphically aware of the homophobic hatred common in Russia,  and we see that this bigotry is not present in Andrei. Rather, he seems to  be ambivalently tolerant of homosexuality.  But when Andrei meets Philip, a  mysterious benefactor for his failing engineering project, strange and  disturbing emotions are awakened.  He is simultaneously fascinated and  frightened by Philip's alluring sensuality and rambling reminiscence of  their relationship in a ""former incarnation"". And Philip is  definitely not what he appears.  Some rather unsubtle imagery establishes  his otherworldly nature. He has apparently returned to thislife to remind  Andrei of his worthiness of love.  The erotic scenes are dreamlike; in the  aftermath Andrei is confused, but he has ""remembered"" his past  existence and relationship with Philip.  Disturbed, he seeks out his  colleague Natasha, and asks her if she believes in reincarnation.  She  admits she does, which leads to her own confession that she has recognized  in Andrei her soulmate in a future existence.  He senses this as well and  is drawn to her.  Painfully, both realize that their future love cannot be  fulfilled in their present life.  Returning to Philip, Andrei is agrieved  to learn that his ""past"" soulmate must go back to Andrei's own  past self... but before leaving, Philip imparts a happy Message for  Andrei's present.  The problem with this film is that the supernaturalism  does not blend well with the grittier scenes of post-Soviet realism; and  the mystical allusions are frequently more confusing to us, the audience,  than to Andrei himself.  Ultimately though, I found the ending enormously  satisfying.  Whoever or whatever Philip really is, his continuing love has  wrought a miracle in Andrei's life.",958176000,5,2512,5.2748091603053435
