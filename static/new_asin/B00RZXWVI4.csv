8696668,3,B00RZXWVI4,This was pretty okay for a low-budget film. The characters weren't stupid and annoying. The plot was kinda okay and was delivered well.,1455062400,,135,4.913043478260869
8696669,5,B00RZXWVI4,"I'm not usually a fan of horror movies, but ""Blood Rites"" really hooked me in and kept me on the edge of my seat during its entire running time. For a low-budget indie film, the movie is masterfully made with energetic performances from the cast, including Karis Yanike, who gives a brave and authentic performance. The supporting cast includes a lot of standouts as well. The direction by Dorothy Booream is assured and never gets in the way of the story or suspense. The cinematography by Chad Haufschild perfectly complements the dread and suspense through his use of shadows and light. This is perhaps the best true independent film to come out of Nebraska so far, and I look forward to seeing what the filmmakers will do for a follow-up movie.",1452384000,,748,4.717557251908397
8696670,1,B00RZXWVI4,"Psycho criminals, one takes a couple hostages who look like Amish devil worshipers. Other then a secondary plot idea there is zero demons or occult involvement. Not even a cameo with a monster...... Definitely marketed in wrong genre.",1447891200,,234,5.184210526315789
8696671,5,B00RZXWVI4,Loved it nice to see someone doing Giallo again and out of Nebraska yet. I am looking forward to more from this group it like Argento and Fulci don't miss this one,1447718400,,163,4.125
8696672,5,B00RZXWVI4,"The movie isn't half bad, but add the sexy as hell Tera Patrick to introduce the movie and the hilariously satirical presence of Girls & Corpses Magazine and its a true winner.",1427760000,2,176,4.53125
8696673,2,B00RZXWVI4,"Saw this movie in the theater.  It is a low budget production but is better than that.  I was surprised.  Expecting a bad one star or less movie.  I would give it two stars.  Saw it again last Halloween in a local movie fest.  It was still as good as I recalled it.  I was surprised because I know a couple of people in the move and thought I was prejudice in how I looked at it and now that sometime had gone by, I thought I would take a fair look at it.  Like I said, I was surprised that it was as good as I remembered it.  See it, and form you own opinion.  It might turn out to be a cult favorite of yours.",1426982400,2,611,3.7401574803149606
