7923412,5,B00004U12Y,"First let me make one thing clear.  I adore Poulenc, and own his complete works.  This is a superb performance by all involved, and a rare opportunity for us in America, where such music is rarely, if ever, heard.  Serene, marvelous, it does give a taste of the peace that dwells within.  In my book, Poulenc has no peer!",1421539200,,321,4.389830508474576
7923413,2,B00004U12Y,"The performance is by a five piece string ensemble, not a band as someone stated. A band has wind instruments and no strings. So, I assume the person was reviewing something else. They also stated that the performance had a soprano and a counter-tenor. It does not. It has one soprano who appears to be singing this with no practice. She looks only at the music and never looks up, therefore, I assume it was performed without an audiance. I am in a classical choir, and none of the soloists have ever showed up at rehearsal so unprepared as this soloist.",1338768000,,555,4.5049504950495045
7923414,1,B00004U12Y,"The Boccherini 'Stabat Mater' is sung hideously (I reviewed it some years ago), the Pergolesi 'Stabat Mater' is not only sung hideously but seems to have been utterly botched by the recording technicians and editors. I haven't had the temerity to listen to the Rossini. There are NO redeeming qualities to this 'box set', since I doubt that it would start much of a camp fire.",1313971200,3,376,4.712121212121212
7923415,3,B00004U12Y,"This is an excellent performance of essential Poulenc; I would enthusiastically recommend it were it not for one inexcusable flaw: there is so much audio compression/limiting of the peak levels it completely spoils the experience, for me at least.  Ruins the dynamics, squashes the larger crescendos into mush; you can actually hear the compressor shamelessly kick in and release, like the mix engineer set it on autopilot, clicked OK, and went out for a beer.  Really sad, that music like this would get the kind of treatment you'd expect in some dime-a-dozen top-40 pop song.  I'd love to hear the unprocessed audio, 'cause it's easily a four-star performance and a good overall recording (btw, I can speak only for the stereo mix, not the Dolby Surround, which I'm not equipped to hear).",1254182400,,790,4.96969696969697
7923416,4,B00004U12Y,"Not only does this piece contain a wonderful performance of Boccherini's Good Friday mass, it marks a vast improvement over some of the other DVDs in this series.  The camera work here is stellar compared to some of the other static examples in other installments.  The audio and the performances are vastly improved as well.  Dragoni is clearly deserving of her acclaim.

Based on reviews I've read on other sites, I'm pleased that Amazon's reviewers are substantially better educated in this genre.  No, this is NOT a music video, so if you are easily bored by a musical performance that lacks pyrotechnics and dancers, move along.  But in terms of ""documenting"" a classic performance of sacred music, this is among the best.",1111968000,,727,4.918032786885246
7923417,5,B00004U12Y,"Then, this is the DVD for you.

Take heed of what the other review says, as its going to be quite an experience. In a way, this is as inspiring as Bach's music and as it is composed in modern time so the mediacy is stronger. And you just have to listen for yourself to see how good these Choirs from Cambridge are singing. Other than the sound, the sights are spectacular and the photography is excellent.",1110240000,2,405,4.259740259740259
7923418,5,B00004U12Y,"Poulenc's Stabat Mater, Litanies a la Vierge Noire, and Quatre Motets pour un Temps de Penitence are performed by beautifully prepared English choirs (plus the BBC Philharmonic in the Stabat Mater). The performances are first-rate; picture and sound quality are excellent. The disc includes an interesting documentary on Black Madonnas and a virtual visit to Rocamadour (where Poulenc underwent a religious experience relevant to the music on this program). Get this one.",1022716800,3,471,5.555555555555555
