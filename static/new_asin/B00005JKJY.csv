1458274,5,B00005JKJY,"Aside from two over-the-top gross out scenes, this is easily my new favorite comedy. Picture Zack from Saved By The Bell in a modern day version of the Animal House. Well, maybe that's a bad comparison since I never liked Animal House all that much. Really witty sexual humor and off-the-wall craziness. Get this DVD (you can always fast-forward through the donut scene and the bathroom scene)",1030147200,,393,4.880597014925373
1458275,5,B00005JKJY,"Ever wonder what it would feel like if you stayed in college for more then four years??? Well Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds) knows.  Actually he has been at college for seven years...and plans to stay there his whole life!!! Everyday he has a new girl, every night he has a new party, and every year it's the same thing.  But after everything goes wrong...his father not paying the bills, and a sexy lady named Gwen Pearson (Tara Reid), this may change his life forever! He decides he does want to graduate...but will he be able to??? Find out in the new UNRATED FILM YOU COULDN'T SEE IN THEATRES that was released on AUGUST the 20!!! One of the best movies of the year. ~~~This movie contains nudity, gross humor, sexual content, and adult language...and is not intended for children...",1029801600,,783,4.625899280575539
1458276,5,B00005JKJY,"I saw this movie, ""National Lampoon's Van Wilder"" the Spring semester of my Senior year in college.  I can't think of a more perfect, funny movie to celebrate my graduation with.  The movie was absolutely hilarious, it had original jokes, great talent and beautiful women (I LOVE YOU TARA REID!!)  The guy who played Van, Ryan Reynolds, has great comic timing and was extremely funny playing the lead role.  I also thought his assistant Taj, stole the show on numerous occasions.  My favorite scene is the one where Taj interviews for the job as Van's assistant.  The supporting cast in this movie was genious also (the principal from breakfast club, the guy who played Booger on Revenge of the Nerds, the guy who played the Sherminator in the American Pie movies).  There was many original jokes in the movie also (ie. Van throws a party in the Hillel :-)
The unrated edition should be absolutely nuts and this is the number one DVD i want to own.  Any fan of comedy and/or college comedies in particular should buy this DVD as soon as it comes out.  You won't be sorry.",1025481600,10,1071,4.594736842105263
1458277,4,B00005JKJY,"The guys at National Lampoon couldn't have picked a better person than Ryan Reynolds to fill the role of Van Wilder. Van Wilder's the man in college we all dreamed of being. He's a modern day college version of Ferris Bueller.
The movie lives up to the National Lampoon standard. It has all the laughs and witty lines you would normally come to expect from a National Lampoon series flick. The predictability isn't as horrid as many of the modern day teen comedy films (Tomcats, American Pie, etc) and isn't quite as low brow as the Scary Movie series.
Definately not a movie to watch with your teens or kids, though.
Overall a funny movie and worth watching. Not to mention worth having for the DVD Collection...",1024876800,,713,4.622047244094488

such plays / movies arrive?
The pranks in this movie if taken as an ""example""

The effect is that there are bounds outside humor of which
one walks only at the danger of extremes in retribution or vengeance.
The cream filled rolls prank is probably a very good example
of going too far.
This movie is supposed to be sophomoric humor that makes us laugh,
but instead gives nightmares like a horror movie?

 There is a return policy for this product, but I think that I shouldn't have to go through that much trouble for the price I spent.... its a waste of my time..

1459335,3,B00005JKJY,"The National Lampoon's series of films have brought us all types of comedies with varying degrees of success. From true american classics like Animal House and the Vacation franchise, to less-than-stellar (Loaded Weapon I and Barely Legal comes readily to mind). Van Wilder, in my humble opinion, is a very deserving entry to the series.

The film's title is extremely appropriate for this film as not only is the story centered around the titular character but Ryan Reynolds is the anchor that holds the entire thing together. Talk about perfect casting, Reynolds truly shines with a combination of physical(his facial expressions throughout the film are priceless) and verbal comedy. Kal Penn, playing his assistant delivers as well. This film probably earned him his future leading roles. The film at its core is all about the classic college stereotypes and one man's crusade to bring them together. If this sounds overly dramatic in the context of this film, don't think for a second that I'm somehow trying to elevate this film above what it really is. The film is a comedy and a raunchy college comedy at that. It is what it is. But in a genre drowning in imitation and cliches, Van Wilder shines because it takes those cliches and makes a really funny (and yes, gross at times but still funny)film. Speaking of cliches, I found it extremely fitting that Curtis Armstrong (Booger on Revenge of the Nerds) and Tim Matheson (Eric Stratton in Animal House)appear in the film playing straight-up, downright nerdy, older characters in the films. It is a nice little nod to the past of the genre and kind of a passing of the torch moment I really enjoyed.

As far the quality of the Blu-Ray disc, its pretty much par for the course. Nothing ground-braking here. While this is by far the best the film has looked on Home Video, (and frankly theaters as well)it falls a bit short compared to other releases of the same time. The film was released in 2002 so it is pretty new compared to other catalog titles but then again I would suspect that this film was not a priority in the ""quality transfer"" queue for the studio.

If you don't already have this on DVD and are a fan of the genre I highly recommend this release. In fact, watch in succession with Animal House and see how much (or how little it would seem at times) this genre has evolved(?) through the years.",1257120000,2,2366,4.6826923076923075

1459338,4,B00005JKJY,"Van Wilder is a movie about everything people love about college, the reasons most reminisced.  It's about debauchery, alcohol, parties, and sex-crazed young adults.  Tailored to a younger male audience, it's full of gross-out humor, genetalia jokes, and crude putdowns.

Ryan Reynolds must have been jumping up and down for this role.  It is unequivocally made for his nonchalant, cool-guy comedic delivery.

Van (Reynolds) has been at Coolidge college for 7 years.  He knows everyone.  He knows everything.  He is basically the most popular kid on the entire campus.  Essentially, he's what&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ferris-Bueller/dp/B00001MXXH/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ferris Bueller</a>&nbsp;would have been in college - a complete slacker with potential for greatness.

When Van's father finds out he's been paying for Van to go to school for seven years, the tuition payments are cut.  When faced with his lack of funding, Van, with the help of his personal assistant Taj (Kal Penn) - an Indian exchange student who desperately wants to have wild college experiences and memories - begin to throw parties in exchange for hard cash.

Meanwhile, Gwen (Tara Reid before she had all that busted plastic surgery and her before her skin began melting) is an aspiring journalist who is assigned a story on Van Wilder.  Neither she nor her pre-med boyfriend Richard are happy about it, and despite the fact that she slowly falls for Van, the incumbent is not going to just give in to the guy who has started to pay for tuition by becoming a party planner.

Possibly the grossest and cruel payback scheme in history is devised, Van follows Gwen's lead when it comes to motivation and graduation, Taj gets his experience, and just about everyone - even a well-endowed bulldog - enjoys a happy ending.  It's a hilarious movie, and if you can look past the poor attempts at a forced romantic sidebar, then you're sure to enjoy the depravity.",1210636800,2,1987,5.2834394904458595

One interesting part of this film is that it seems to get tired with the ""campus craziness"" routine and opt for a college romance movie instead.  I'm not sure whether I approve of the decision.

1459526,4,B00005JKJY,"National Lampoon brought the raunchy and raucous college world to the mainstream kids back in the 1970's with Animal House, which would go on to virtually springboard the careers of several of its stars, including John Belushi and Tim Matheson.

But for those of us who may have been born after the original release of AH and raised on films like the American Pie trilogy get a new version of Animal House for the new generation with Van Wilder.

Van (Ryan Reynolds) is the virtual definition of a slacker in the college world, having spent seven years attending Coolidge College.  He is pretty much the life of the party and he revels in it greatly.  It's only until his dad (Matheson) finds out that Van is still in school and places a halt to Van's tuition payment that he realizes that it's time to get his head in the game and find a way to graduate and pay tuition.

A story printed by the school's star reporter Gwen (Tara Reid) causes Van to become a party planner and raise the money for his tuition, along with the help of his closest friend (Teck Holmes of ""Real World"" fame) and his personal assistant (Kal Penn). When a relationship develops between Van and Gwen, Gwen's pretentious boyfriend Richard tries to put a wedge between them.  When Van learns of this, he gets a little revenge in one of the most ingenious and disgusting ways ever devised (trust me, this has the humping a pie thing beaten hands down, no pun intended...)

Van Wilder is pretty hilarious in spots and somewhat disgusting in others, particularly the classic payback Van pulls on Richard and later on when Gwen also gets a little revenge on Richard when she learns a little something that Richard did behind Gwen's back.  Also, Penn and Holmes have some gut-busting moments in support and is it nice to see Matheson deciding to continue his association with National Lampoon by bridging the gap between Animal House and Van Wilder.

A word of advice, though: if you have a weak stomach, this is not the movie for you.  But if have that type of sense of humor that thinks that letting one rip loudly in public causes you to double over with laughter, then definitely check out Van Wilder.",1098144000,13,2174,4.594315245478036

I think the director probably thought the script was strong enough, and because the movie is supposed to be silly that it wouldn't matter who played Gwen (Reid's role). However, putting my hatred for her aside, I do recommend this film for a good laugh.",1092873600,5,711,4.427480916030534
1459529,4,B00005JKJY,"Van Wilder is the kind of movie you either love or hate. It's definetly a movie thats geared toward older teenage and 20's men. Its that dirty disgusting gross out humor, so if you don't like that kind of stuff get off this page.

Van Wilder(Reynolds) has been in college for 7 years. He's loved his years at Coolidge and the students love him. Wilder is so popular he has a personal assistant Taj(Penn) an Indian exchange student that Wilders promises to get some action. Thats all Wilder really does. He doesn't go to classes, but parties. It's at one of these parties where his dad finds him at tells him he's cutting his money supply.

With no money Wilder can't pay his tutition. So he starts throwing parties for cash to stay in school. In the meantime Gwen(Reid) has been given the assignment to write a paper on Van. Gwen wants nothing to do with Van and thinks he a loser. She has to do the story and quickly finds herself falling for him. She wants him to graduate and he's not so sure on it. He likes Gwen but he's not sure if he can change for her.

I love Ryan Reynolds. This guy is one of the funniest underrated guys in Hollywood. His comedic timing is awesome and he's so sarcastic. He pulls it off like very few can. This guy is going to be huge one day.

This is also Tara Reid's best movie. She is so hot in it. She has good chemistry with Reynolds, and it's not the typcial character we always see her playing. It's really ironic to see her play this kind of character to who she is as a person.

This movie is labeled as Animal House but it isn't. It's not as good as Old School either. It is however a very funny movie. It's a fun gross out comedey. If you like those kind of movies, then pick this one up. If you don't, like I said earlier why are you here.",1091577600,4,1780,4.177842565597667

I bought it when it was first released on DVD and didn't watch it until about 2 months after owning it, but when I finally got around to watching it I realized taht I made a huge mistake waiting as long as I did, as this was truly a great movie. The emotion is very apparent as I felt like I got to know the characters and it led me to follow Ryan Reynold's career by buying ""The In-Laws"" when that came out on DVD as well. I also became an avid ""Two Guys and A Girl"" watcher after catching him on it, as he is a great actor for these kind of roles. Pretty much everyone I've watched this movie with has gone into the movie thinking ""this can't be as good as he's making it out to be"" and then after the movie is over, they go out and buy the dvd themselves, so do yourselves a favor and buy this one as well...",1082851200,,968,3.918781725888325
1459649,5,B00005JKJY,"I know you have heard about the dog scene, and probably will see the movie or avoid it because of that, but forget about it, that was one scene in the movie.  The movie in a whole is hillarious and has characters that you either hate or love.
This has to be one of the best college movie in years and the best National Lampoons has done in a long time.  They created an interesting and very charasmatic character called Van Wilder.  A man who has been in college for most of a decade achieving legendary status, but no degree.  He handles school like a politician, active in most facets, sports, art, social events, and renowned for his parties.  But for some reason is afraid to graduate.
His character is what really drived the movie.  He is funny without being mean, intruguing without being far fetched, and interesting to watch.  The humor is all over the place, puns, word plays, situational, crude, as well as deadpan.  But most importantly it creates a character that you not only laugh at and with, but actually care about.  I wish he had gone to the colleges I have been to.
so as stated before, forget about the dog scene, and just watch the movie, you won't regret it.",1082505600,2,1180,4.4511627906976745
1459650,3,B00005JKJY,"I wish my college days were as interesting as Van Wilder's were. Since they weren't, I have to rely on this movie to remind me that some people have the ability to be quite extreme, even if it's just fiction.
 This movie walks the fine line between decent comedy and crude humor. Sometimes it lingers a little too long on the crude humor side, like an entire sequence involving a dog, some eclairs, and the Delta Iota Kappa Fraternity. Even though I've been told they used creamed honey, that scene still makes me gag.
 There are a few truely funny moments, like Taj's interview for Van Wilder's personal assistant, Sick Boy, the ice hockey challenge between Van and Gwen, and the running feud between McDougal's car and Wilder's golf cart. However, there are also equally disturbing moments like the eclair scene I mentioned, Richard's Northwestern interview, and Wilder's talk with the woman in charge of tuition payments.
 Overall this isn't a bad movie if you don't mind some crude humor. Despite being a comedy there's a secondary plot that involves Van and a serious desire to not grow up, which you watch develop through the movie. It's one of those park your brain and just enjoy kind of movies.",1081036800,,1203,4.746411483253588

Good acting by Ryan Reynolds (playing a guy that so used to life at the campus he doesn't want to graduate). Even Tara Reid is adequate. You can enjoy this movie if you don't expect much from it.",1080518400,,394,4.197368421052632
1459652,4,B00005JKJY,"I found this a super funny laid-back comedy. the film makers didn't try much to make this a super-duper out of this world movie, but it turned out very kool, indeed. i think its a great light comedy which i can watch whenever, with my friends or by myself :)",1079740800,,258,4.18
1459653,4,B00005JKJY,"Oh, it's not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination. And you won't see any Oscsr-worthy performances. What you will see, though, is a funny and entertaining movie. Which are the reasons why I thought we all watched comedies. Van Wilder is still at Coolidge College. For ""the better part of a decade."" His Dad decides to cut his losses and cancels the tuition check for the upcoming semester. How Van copes with that decision lays the groudwork for the rest of the film.
We find out that Van hasn't wasted his time at Coolidge, at all. Van is an above-average student, a partier, a philanthropist, a cheerleader, an inspiration to his fellow students, and, for the past couple of years has been just 18 credits shy of graduating.  And for all of the right reasons. He just loves what he does, even if it is in college and not in the 'real' world. Gwen Pearson's (Tara Reid) job, as a campus newspaper reporter, is to find out what makes him tick. The rest of the movie lays out the ups and downs of raising the necessary tuition money ('Topless Tutors', for one) and the inevitable reckoning that it's time to move on. And it does it in entertaining and sometimes gut-wrenchingly funny ways.
""Van Wilder"" is populated with unique characters and some interesting, almost cameo-type, performances.  You'll see Erik Estrada, Curtis Armstrong and Paul Gleason in small supporting roles that still give them a chance to display their talent. My favorites are Taj, the Indian exchange student hired as Van's personal assistant, and Daniel Cosgrove as Van's soon-to-be arch nemesis. The movie is also loaded with hilarious scenes that play much like SNL skits. Examples? The entire scene on auditioning for the personal assistant's job; Van's visit to Gwen's house where he meets her parents; Hutch and the 'bong'; and Van's 'day in court.' Of course, if you haven't seen the movie none of this means much to you.
Which gets me to... see the movie. Now, I'm sure that some of you will hate it. Understood. I thought it was just a bit too sophomoric the first time I watched it. After the third viewing I was convinced there was a method to the madness and some subtle hints of genius are at work here. Oh, write that down.",1077408000,3,2223,4.668367346938775
1459654,4,B00005JKJY,"The story revolves around the big man on campus Van Wilder(Ryan Reynolds). He is the most popular kid in the school and is known by basically everyone. However, he has been there for seven years and now his dad finally decides to stop paying his tuition. Van is determined to stay in school and turns to the aid of a secretary that he hires (played by the hilarious Indian actor Kal Penn). They come up with the idea of planning parties, and soon everyone on campus wants a party that has been planned by Van Wilder. Meanwhile, a reporter for the school paper ( Tara Reid), is determined to get the scoop on Van Wilder because no one ever has before. However, her boyfriend Richard ( Daniel Cosgrove) is the head of a geeky fraternity and is very jealous. He goes out of his way to make Van Wilder's life miserable. Now Van must be able to stay in school and impress the reporter while getting even with her boyfriend.
Before I watched this film, I was extremely skeptical. From the previews, it looked it was going to be horrible. However, since National Lampoon has had a pretty good track record when it comes to comedies, I decided to give it a shot. Van Wilder turned out to be one of the funniest films I have seen in the last 5 years. In fact, by the time the end of the film rolled around, my stomach hurt from laughing so much. Some of gags in this movie really push the envelope when it comes to disgusting and raunchy comedy. That is why my advice is to watch this film on an empty stomach, because a few of the gags will make you want to throw up after you see them. They are so raunchy in fact, that they make American Pie look weak by comparison. The plot of the movie is ridiculous and borders on being stupid, which is why I can only give Van Wilder 4 stars. But the movie makes up for it by providing non-stop laughs and tons of great gags.
If you are looking for a comedy to watch, don't pass up Van Wilder. This is the funniest college comedy I have seen since Animal House. I would even go as far to say that it is the Animal House of today. The 2 Disc DVD itself actually provides for some pretty good extras. The deleted scenes and outtakes are classic!!",1077321600,,2176,4.2457831325301205

His rich-poltical father is about to cut off his party boy son and make him make his own way. Ryan Reynold is the cool guy we all wished we were in college. He's sort of the college version of high schools Ferris Beuller. Tara Reed is sexier than ever and look out for the sceen stealing Taj Mahal Badalandabad(Indian exchange student),played by Kal Penn.

1459734,1,B00005JKJY,"As an freshman in college, my roommate rented ""Van Wilder"", assuring me that it was a funny movie.  After watching it, I was sadly disappointed in not only the quality of its story/humor but also in how it portrays college life.

There is nothing innovative in ""Van Wilder"".  The story is your basic tale of the ""rich kid who doesn't work at school and therefore hasn't graduated in 7 years.""  Throw a girl into the mix, sprinkle some relationship problems, and you have a trite, meaningless film.  That is exactly what this reeking pustule of cinematic fiction is.  The humor relies only on obscenities and crass sexuality, not giving the viewer any sort of edification (aesthetically, comically, or otherwise).

In addition to this, ""Van Wilder"" promotes only the worst aspects of college life, glorifying them at at time when such aspects should be reprimanded.  The events in the movie promote the partying, obsessed-with-relationships style of life which is indicative of the introversion which will destroy Western civilization.  This is definitely not what this Nation's youth needs during a critical time in our history and the history of the world.

I'm sorry, world of Amazon, I know that this is not the type of review that you want to see.  Nonetheless, ""Van Wilder"" is definitely not a movie which deserves praise on any level.  It is neither innovative nor edifying.  It does not truly brighten the viewer's day, make them think, and most definitely doesn't promote anything remotely related to goodness or Truth.",1055808000,6,1527,5.011904761904762

It's funny, gross, rude, stupid at times, sexy (Tara Reid again), pointless, and a masterpiece all at the same time.

This movie was about Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds) has been at Coolidge College for 7 years, never passing (or just leaving.) Van Wilder is a ""party person"" who always has a good time. Geeks and others look up to him, he is a very popular kid for others. He even has own assistant for himself. Van Wilder trys to help everyone though. He's the ""nicer popular person."" And Van Wilder meets this girl named Gwen Pearson (Tara Reid) who is doing an interview on Van. They fall in love, but their not going out. Van's dad finds out that Van has been in College for 7 years, so Van's Dad isn't paying for Van's college funds. Gwen teaches Van to do something with his life, and not stay in college for as long as he is.
I thought this movie was getting way to off topic when Gwen came into this movie. It wasn't focusing on the main idea anymore, it was focusing on their relationship (which they really don't have), instead of him getting money and staying into college, like he really wants to do.
Acting wise no one was special, none of the characters were the best, but if I had to pick someone it would be Tara Reid, followed up by Ryan Reynolds. No special apperances were really made except for Chris Owen.
Over all I would give this movie 1.5 stars, which rounds up to 2 stars. This movie had some of it's moments, but really it wasn't hilarious. The begining was the best. The first like 20 minutes. Nothing was that great, the plot was stupid, I'd give it 2/5 stars. Acting I'd give 2/5. And extras, and other I'd give 1.5/5 stars. So I gave it 2 stars.

Van Wilder is a seventh-year undergrad at Coolidge College.  Having become a school institution after attending so long, he's pretty much become the master of all things collegiate.  Except for the graduating part.  Life is fun and games for Van and his pals.  He even has students queued to interview to become his personal assistant.  He ends up choosing an Indian student who craves a taste of the bacchanalian life before being sent home.  How better to fulfill that desire than with Van Wilder as your mentor!  Wha-whooo!  Van parties and remains ignorant of his situation until a school newspaper reporter named Gwen (Tara Reid) shows up because she's required to do a piece on him.  Soon enough they end up falling for each other (surprise!) and he gets serious about school.  But there's a couple small problems:  Her pre-med, frat-boy boyfriend, and Van has to actually go to class.
There's not much new here, really.  Plop this down among all the other innumerable movies of this ilk.  The American Pie movies are funnier.  They also have more characters who are funny.  This one rests on just a few.
Having said that, this movie has some humorous moments.  The best laughs come from Van's and his roommate's pet bulldog's genitalia.  (No pun intended.)  Or uncontrollable bowel movements.  These incidents did make me crack up (and cringe in disgust).  They just happen to be at the exteme end of sick humor.
Viewable for those who like gross-out humor and get your thrills from a couple flashes of female breasts.  Overall I'd give Van a barely passable grade of C- in Entertainment 101.  Write that down.",1038787200,,1803,4.813725490196078
1459860,2,B00005JKJY,"At one time National Lampoon's movies were hysterical, now they have funny moments and this is one of those movies.  Van has been attending the same college for the past 7 years.  Initially it seems that he is doing it just to piss off his father but there could be more to it than that.  When his father visits he finds Van throwing the biggest party of the year and that his fellow students look upon Van with awe.  Dad puts a stop to all that by refusing to pay Van's way any longer.  The rest of the movie deals with Wilder finding ways to stay in school, falling in love, and realizing there is more to himself than he initially thought.
This is of course a formula movie.  Unfortunately it isn't exactly a successful one.  The story is relatively weak, the humor falls flat on it's face often, the acting is average (Ryan Reynolds character of Van seems very similar to his Berg of Two Guys and a Girl fame) and you really don't care about the characters that much.  The movie wasn't bad; it just wasn't all that good.  There were some funny moments but they were few and far between.  For a good movie everyone should skip this and go to Van's father's (Tim Matheson) early work and see National Lampoon's Animal House.  That was great!

Ryan Reynolds is simply amazing. I don't think Ive seen any other of his movies, except for the small part in Dick.
Without Kal Penn, as Taj, Van Wilder wouldve been nothing. Foreign exchange students always make all the difference. Daniel Cosgrove as Richard, who also plays Bill on Guiding Light impressed me by being in this movie, with this amazing cast.
I don't usually like Tara Reid, this time she was worth watching. She was the only regular-normal person of them all. Mind you, its just in acting, and only in Van Wilder.
I watched Van Wilder 3 times, one after the other. I just couldn't get enough. So the bonuses came in handy. There was a whole other DVD full of additional stuff, deleted scenes, interviews, and all kinds of VW specials. The menu its self was defiantly different.

1460005,4,B00005JKJY,"Van Wilder is more of an average teen movie than anything else. It's not exquisite, outlandish, bizarre, subtle or dark. There's tons of movies like these, and rarely do i feel bound to them as much as i did to this one. Unlike Kevin Smith's greatness to the averageness of comedy on say Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, the few gems that surface on the average teen genre don't entirely rely on the script, but rather on the performance. Saving Silverman is a good example. Jack Black and Steve Zahn pretty much own the whole movie. They put that little something into it that makes you not care how many times you watch it when you feel like comedy rather than anything else. Ryan Reynolds did exactly that with this movie. His personality obviously transmutated into his character, which is much like that back in his sitcoms days. He is a superb comedian, and much like Will Ferrel, he knows how to say things and how to act that same expression out. It's those little details that put you at ease and eager to watch it again. He is also extremely well complemented by Taj, Kal Penn, who gives additional comic relief throughout.
Trying not to focus much on the fact it's a National Lampoon movie, and the fact that it relies so much on the tried and true boy-meets-girl linearity, it's still a very good movie. I don't even really dig these type of comedies that much, not enough to buy the DVDs.. but there are exceptions.",1035417600,3,1427,4.513513513513513

1460007,3,B00005JKJY,"Van Wilder (Ryan Reynolds, TVs 2 GUYS AND A GIRL) is a total party animal, who is so much The Big Man on campus at Coolidge College that he enlists a horny Indian exchange student to act as his P.A. But his Dad freezes his college funds, limiting his college days and his social status. (His credo is ""Don't be a fool, stay in school"" which he uses after he fails to stop a fellow student from leaping to his death). After seven years of college he doesn't want to face up to the fact that out in the Real World he'll be a nobody. But inspiration, ingenuity and sheer determination strike, which seems strange for such a lazy so-and-so; and he soon starts a lucrative business as VAN WILDER: PARTY LIAISON putting an end to parties ""that suck"". AMERICAN PIE's Tara Reid also stars. As her character notes of Van: ""Most people want to get out of school so they can make money, you want to make money so you can stay IN school"".
The movie also stars an adorable bulldog whose, um, tackle helps set up VAN WILDER's peak gross out, which tops AMERICAN PIE's ""warm apple pie"" scene. Don't say you weren't warned...",1034899200,3,1109,4.388349514563107
1460008,2,B00005JKJY,"There's a real story here - a guy who on the surface looks like a slacker and perpetual partier. But then we learn that he does tons of charity fundraisers and secretly organizes parties for nerds, who need a little help with their social lives. He even helps talk a guy out of killing himself. Unfortunately, all of that is lost in really bad humor. In particular, the Bulldog pastry-eating scene. Then there's the tired, overdone jokes: the sex-starved old-woman, the sex-starved foreign exchange student, the sex-starved high-IQ nerds. Tara Reid's character is devoid of personality, and her boyfriend, naturally, is completely unlikable. Reynolds is funny, but he could do so much better with a better movie. As best it's disappointing, at worst it's disqusting. Rent it when you have a freebie coupon.",1034640000,,806,5.067669172932331
1460009,5,B00005JKJY,"At first this movie looked like the same old American Pie theme flick. Although that sure did change in the first 15 minutes, the comedy is so unique with Ryan Reynolds playing the part of Van Wilder so well. There are some gross scenes that will have you crying with laughter...literally. This movie has by far the best revenge ideas ever portrayed in recent films. Hats off to National Lampoon.",1034208000,,396,4.671428571428572
1460010,4,B00005JKJY,"I'll begin with a confession:  I was reluctant to watch this film.  It was snobbish on my part.  A recent interview with Tara Reid in MAXIM portrayed the actress as a shallow ditz, and I doubted that the voluntary suspension of disbelief would succeed in allowing me to see her as serious college student Gwen Pearson.  This was the crux of my objection to NATIONAL LAMPOON'S VAN WILDER.  My husband cleverly defeated my opposition with the ""Yes, but she's a really hot chick"" argument, and we bought the DVD.  To my surprise, Reid pulls off the act, dropping words like ""pander"" and phrases like ""benevolent agenda"" as if they had belonged in her personal vocabulary bank all along.
The writing goes far beyond clever.  It's down right poetic, with lines dance on the ear like a butterfly on a buttercup.  Take, for example, ""That's no bong!  That's for my shlong!""  Watch out Shakespeare.
Best of all, the movie answers the age-old question:  What was Ferris Bueller like in college?  Van Wilder (Ryan Reynonds) fits the mold rather closely.  He's a philanthropist who knows how to have a good time.  He's funny, good looking, and popular with just about everyone.  Brilliant ideas like topless tutors and the naked mile run are a-dime-a-dozen with this guy.  Most importantly, he gets away with everything.  I'm glad I didn't get away with turning my nose up at this delightfully amusing film.  So even if you're skeptical, give it a try, and don't neglect to consider that Tara Reid's a really hot chick.",1034121600,8,1508,4.77906976744186

1460013,4,B00005JKJY,"This comedy is disgusting, vile, filthy, and yes, it almost made me lose my breakfast, lunch and dinner ! It involves fun, frolicking, and fluids...no other college campus comedy has made me laugh this hard in years ! Ryan Reynolds' campy and humorous role is dead on hilarious; at times his mannerisms and way of speaking almost cry out Jim Carrey (though he looks nothing like Carrey). That's the beauty of this film...it makes viewers react either with appalling revulsion and disgust or with gutbusting laughter... both in my case !
The plot and premise are short, simple,and superficial (this is not Cannes Film Festival or Academy Awards material by a long shot). It's about a college student who loves the partying and socializing college life who has been living it up for the past 7 years...That is until his pops is tired of footing his educational bill and cuts all funding. Now, he and his campus buddies/associates must figure a way to keep his educational partying lifestyle afloat...Tara Reid's character figures in as a college newspaper journalist who must get the scoop on what it is that makes the enigmatic Van Wilder so popular with the student body but not with  a certain anal retentive fraternity and teaching staff ! And, yes , ""does boy get girl ?"" also comes into play...watch the dvd for the answer!
Van Wilder is filled with various college student stereotypes which only adds to the rich humorous mix !...",1033171200,,1435,4.833333333333333

Tara Reid seemed like a walking corpse through this flick, and the characters were weak, the jokes not funny, and the story non-existant. A poor excuse of an American Pie rip-off.
The only bright spot in the film is Ryan Renolds as Van, but even he got tired quickly.",1033171200,2,396,4.438356164383562

It did almost make me sick once, so don't eat while watching... but even the sick part was sooooo funny!  I was rolling on the floor laughing...  Its true, if you loved american pie, and road trip... you will love this too.  I think those people down there that said 1 or 2 stars, and were disappointed about it not being another animal house, must have actually been in college when animal house came out. So to them, nothing beats it.  Yes, I did see animal house, and I loved that one too. So, no matter how old you are, if you enjoy a movie that is hillarious and a little nasty, watch this one, you'll be laughing so hard that you will have tears!

1460138,4,B00005JKJY,"When a film says, ""From the makers of Animal House,"" one kind of expects a movie like Animal House (maybe it didn't, but that was my impression). Van Wilder is unfortunately not Animal House. Animal House was an epic comedy that defined a generation. Van Wilder was a pathetic attempt to define a generation.
 However, I must say that I enjoyed it. It was filled with the great, endearing characters that made us love National Lampoons to begin with. Ryan Reynolds was great, but while being at times very raunchy, had a certain sweetness to him. Tara Reid was great. But the thing that carried the movie was the writing. From the opening scene, the writing enchants and enthralls you and keeps you laughing.
 The R-rating is for some SICK humor, sexuality, nudity and  language. If you enjoy sex comedies that keep you in stitches, this is for you.",1032307200,3,849,4.684563758389261
1460139,3,B00005JKJY,"In looking back, we see National Lampoon with its almost consistant track record of highs (H) and lows (L); Animal House '78(H), Class Reunion '82(L), Vacation '83(H), Ero Vacation '85(L), X-Mas Vacation '89(H), Last Resort '93(L), Loaded Weapon '93(H), Deadly Sin '95(L), Vegas Vacation '97(L)Golf Punks '98(L).  We arrive at a new Nat Lam idea (Van Wilder) and made good producing the expected high.  Plot continuity was almost dead on and never left me scratching my head. Jokes were well thought out and I only remember one ""groaner."" The cast was well picked with the exception of Reid who, under no circumstances, has ever delivered a good performance. Rating with three stars, this movie could have earned four had Tara been left off the casting list during pre-production. Van Wilder comes with my recommendation as a needed addition to your DVD collection.",1032220800,,865,5.084507042253521
1460140,4,B00005JKJY,"If you enjoyed American Pie and Road Trip, than you will LOVE Van Wilder. This movie was so outrageously funny that I had tears rolling down my face!
  Van Wilder is a student in his seventh year in college and his father has chosen to stop paying for his tuition. Van and his personal assistant come up with some pretty creative ways to earn money for his education. He starts with topless tutors and works his way from there.
  On top of all the stress of trying to come up with money to stay in school, Van has fallen in love, with a taken girl ( Tara Reed). He needs to figure out a way to get her to ditch her  ""FRAT BOY"" man.

There are some very gross moments and some very sweet. Overall I thought the movie was great and pretty funny. Ryan Reynolds just makes the movie a lot funnier with such lines like..""Are you stocking me cause that would be super!"" It's a very funny movie and if your a teenager, I'm positive you'll enjoy it as much as I did.",1031184000,,456,4.313953488372093
1460142,3,B00005JKJY,"Now here's a movie that has great potential to be a great college comedy. The movie is very funny and some great comedic moments, mostly coming from the star of the film, Ryan Reynolds. Ryan has some really good on screen chemistry and I sure hope to see him in some more comedies to come. The film has a good, although sometimes off the wall gross, script and keeps things interesting most of the way through. (Although the film is a little bit on the predictable side) The supporting cast does a great job, especially the part of ""Taj"" who provides some of the funniest moments in the movie, next to Ryan Reynolds. The only weak link I found in the cast is Tara Reid. She is simply a terrible actress. No talent at all. A monkey could act better than her. Totally listless and uninspired. It is very obvious that her acting jobs did not come to her due to her incredible acting talent. She should be thankful she's so good looking or she would be acting in some off off off off off broadway production of Our Town.
Otherwise, the movie comes off pretty funny. It drags in a few cases, but picks back up rather quickly. I gave it 3 stars. I took away 1 star because I felt that they could have worked with the story a little more. (Maybe show some more of the ""parties"" Van plans) I mean, he earned all this money for planning all these parties and we got to see, what, 2 of them?!? And I took off the other star for Tara Reid's awful as usual performance.
A solid effort from National Lampoon's. I wouldn't put it up there with the Vacations or Animal House, but A good comedy none-the-less. 3/5",1030924800,3,1597,4.308970099667774

Plot: Big man on campus, party guy, has a crisis, he is then forced to grow up and shows everybody that he is really a good guy - Oh please!  This movie was so bad.  To even imagine that the same entity, National Lampoon, brought us Animal House is almost beyond belief.  Do not buy, rent or watch this movie.  Watch Animal House again - a much better use of your time.  ... A few (like two) scenes with breast - big deal.  If you think you are going to get some benifit by watching the ""unrated version"", think again.
