8137743,4,B000H9JHN0,I am a teacher and used this for my 6th grade class at the end of a tsunami unit. We watched other video about tsunamis first and this one gave us the different view and the history of how long they have been going on. It shows actual footage of tsunamis which I really enjoyed seeing and so did my students. Great for educational use!,1402876800,,335,4.1692307692307695
8137744,2,B000H9JHN0,"My wife and I purchased this DVD so as to learn more about the science behind tsunamis. Unfortunately, this video is much more suitable for someone who is interested in dramatic video footage showing the carnage wrought by tsunamis. If you want to learn about the mechanics behind tsunamis and subduction faults, look elsewhere.",1369699200,,328,5.092592592592593
8137745,5,B000H9JHN0,"This covers the 2004 south pacific one with researchers asking how it happened, but then asks the titles question.  My DVD included the ""Raging planet:Tsunami"" program as well for more stories on such.  Their may be sections that can be skipped, but it's pretty good.  The main conclusion is if you're on a coastline, you may have just minutes before a repeat of the south pacific events can happen to you.  With that one in 2004, Japan having such in 2011, where is the next one due and when?  Hope we're ready.",1341705600,2,512,4.521739130434782
8137746,4,B000H9JHN0,"This documentary gave a lot of great information about the history of tsunamis and the why and how, but was a little too drawn out for teens, unless they are really into detail. My group has short attention spans so I previewed it and wrote a worksheet to go along with it to keep their attention.",1336089600,2,297,4.321428571428571
8137747,5,B000H9JHN0,"I turned on the Discovery Channel and caught this program half way through. It was a very interesting, informative and well put together program about where a Tsunami is likely to occur in America, and vital information from scientists who are tracking them, and just exactly where it's very likely to occur, the reasons, and also feedback on the Tsunami in Thailand. I decided to add this video to my collection and purchased it second hand through Amazon. I've already watched it twice and have lent it to friends as well, who had no idea of certain information contained in this video.
We all should have this information. It's reall food for thought!",1303430400,2,654,4.79646017699115
8137748,5,B000H9JHN0,"In this informative DVD, the very real possibility of a devastating Tsunami on the west coast of the United States is explained.  It tells us that it has happenend in the past per archaeological findings.  It is not frightening, but we need to have this knowledge in order to prepare.",1256601600,3,284,4.66
8137749,3,B000H9JHN0,"This title is just a little bit misleading: while the work does ask if Seattle and Vancouver could be hit with a destructive tsunami, it focuses just as much on describing the 2006 tsunami closest to Asia and showing researchers trying to find the physical proof of the raised ocean floor that caused it.

This work warns sensitive viewers not to watch.  That was a good idea.  This work includes reenactments showing WA state and Oregon being hit.  It also shows a lot of the footage of death and destruction in Asia.  Some of this stuff may be too horrific for some viewers to take.  The work almost implies that West Coasters cannot prepare for or fight the tsunami.  This makes me very concerned for those people I know that live in Seattle.

I really have to think the documentary makers because I am not a ""science person,"" but this work didn't scare me off.  To be honest though, the search for the raised ocean floor was a bit boring.  This work basically has an exciting beginning and ending, but a boring middle.

I wonder too if one incident would rub environmentalists the wrong way.  The scientists find this long being on the ocean floor.  I couldn't really tell if it was a plant or an animal.  They suck it up and examine it.  They conclude that it was there for 10 years and so this could not have been the risen ocean floor area in question.  Okay, so was this like picking an apple or was this like killing a rabbit testing a perfume?  If an organism is on the bottom of the ocean floor, should we be killing it?  Do we know if its numbers are prolific enough?  Is there a way to learn things without having to kill organisms?  I don't want to overstate it, but I was curious if killing that creature was like killing a dolphin or a whale.",1218758400,,1758,4.367283950617284
