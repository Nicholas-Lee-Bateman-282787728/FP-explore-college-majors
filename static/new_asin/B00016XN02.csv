1975330,1,B00016XN02,Please - a real figure skaing fan wants to see skating not Michael Feinstein hamming it up.  Very disappointed in this DVD.  This seems to be a trend - guess the real fans aren't protesting enough!!,1151884800,11,198,4.472222222222222
1975331,5,B00016XN02,"I really enjoyed the DVD.  I am a big fan of Scott Hamilton.  It also included people like Brian Orser, Ekaterina Gordeeva, and others that I enjoy watching.  The music selection from Michael Feinstein was nice and gave it an elegant touch.  I would recommend it.  I would also recommend the Stars on Ice Volumes I, II, and III with Scott Hamilton and other really good figure skaters.",1143244800,,385,4.602941176470588
1975332,5,B00016XN02,"there is something so classical about ice skating;  so clean and neat as to invigorate. now, add the EVER intense michael feinstein to personally sing the songs for the skaters routines, and its showtime ! frankly, i could watch michael feinstein all day. that smile, that energy; that zeal for his music, and for the ice artists. wow. scott hamilton skates in this production ,of course, acting more as host this time, though, to feinstein and the other skaters.he also serves as announcer throughout the show - with a good bit of song introductory as well from feinstein. another plus in this particular ice skating showcase....berlin and gershwin tunes abound! who knew you could get such a fabulous skating routine out of stormy weather ? notable in the show, also, is its  surprise guest star- the great darlene love- singing cry me a river with all of the passion that the song intended - and then some. i recommend this dvd ; its a joyful show to watch.",1139961600,,960,4.708333333333333
1975333,2,B00016XN02,"I bought this as a gift for my wife who is an avid skating and Scott Hamilton fan.  She was disappointed that a good part of the skating performance is missed because the camera keeps cutting away to Michael Feinstein and his band.  Both the music and skating are good, but the mixture of always switching from the skating to the music creates a sub par skating DVD.  She did not find this fault with the tv performances of Scott Hamilton and Friends that were done as a charity event for cancer.  In these shows, the camera kept the skating as its number 1 focus.",1075248000,53,564,4.3428571428571425
1975334,5,B00016XN02,"Scott Hamilton has always been known to dazzle audiences with his incredible skill, artistry, showmanship, and pure love for the sport of figure skating. This DVD is the perfect blend of all of those elements. Not only is the showed compiled of some of the most well-known and talented skaters in the world such as Jenni Meno, Brian Orser and Jozef Sabovcik, but the show is also beautifully accompanied and orchestrated by musical great Michael Feinstein. Feinstein is also joined by actress and sixties pop great, Darlene Love. What makes this show all the more amazing, besides the roster of incredible talent, is that it is completely live. The electricity of all the performers seems to radiate through the screen and you can just feel the energy of all of these performers, performing to a live audience. The DVD also includes special behind the scenes features such as interviews with the artists and artistic director, rehearsals and a special inside look on the creation process of the show, which blew me away.  This DVD is a must have for skating fans, music fans and anyone who enjoys good show!!!!!",1073952000,28,1111,4.878306878306878
1975335,5,B00016XN02,I wasn't crazy with the DVD. The music puts me to sleep. Love the skaters but it was just too slow for me. BUT the DVD itself was in great condition and I was very happy with the delivery from the seller. Very professional and honest. I would differently buy from him again and highly recommend him. Just the DVD itself wasn't for me.,1362355200,,334,4.234375
1975336,5,B00016XN02,I really enjoyed this video.  Very talented cast.  It was nice to see just plain skating that is so artistic.  The competitions have become jumping contests leaving  little room for the artistic portion to shine through.,1354492800,,220,5.027777777777778
1975337,5,B00016XN02,"This DVD was a wonderful tribute to skating and Scott Hamilton and Michael Feinstein.  Enjoyed every minute of it.
Amazing",1352851200,,122,5.1
1975338,5,B00016XN02,Enjoyable for anyone who likes watching pros do a great job ! A real  treat is the wonderful Darlene Love as a special guest star. Don't miss this.,1346198400,,147,4.25
1975339,5,B00016XN02,"I love ice skating, have seen Scott Hamilton live and have a huge respect for him as a skater and as a man. I am a long time fan of Michael Feinstein and have seen him on stage. I especially enjoy going to see him when he appears at his supper club, Feinstein's, at the Lowe's Regency in NYC. This DVD is the next best thing to having been in the audience for an amazing show. In fact, it is better in some ways. Along with the show, you get interviews, behind the scenes footage and some terrific camera's eye views of the skaters' footwork.

I did not even look at the other reviews until just now, because I knew I would love it. I guess I can sympathize with some of the comments, in that skating events very seldom include live music. When the musical performance is ""in the can,"" all you have to do is look at the skaters. I attended a taping performance of an ice show with some live music provided by Sarah Brightman and it was a challenge to decide between watching the skaters and watching Sarah. Personally, I bought this equally for the music and the skating (or maybe even a little more for the musical  performance) and I was not disappointed by Michael, Darlene Love or the band. However, I have never enjoyed skating more.

One thing I do not enjoy about skating shows or competitions is the butchered musical arrangements created to fit the skating program. Here, you have a perfectly integrated performance where the musical arrangements are frequently stretched to allow the skaters more scope. A special instance is one of my favorite Feinstein interpretations: ""My Favorite Year."" The song had special meaning for the skaters and they were given ample opportunity to show that emotion in their dance. Scot Hamilton's performance of ""Only One Life"" is a piece of grand theatre all by itself.

If music is just something they play so the skaters have a pattern to follow, this may not be the DVD for you. If, on the other hand, the music is an integral part of your enjoyment of the skating performance, as is obviously the case for these famous and marvelous skaters, then you need this DVD. You will laugh, maybe shed a tear and groan at the awful jokes as you would at a wonderful play. I watched the extra features first and I recommend that process. You will learn some information about the skaters and the show that will add to your enjoyment.",1335571200,5,2369,4.515151515151516
1975340,3,B00016XN02,"I personally love ice skating; I think too much time was spent on the singer Feinsteine. If he so special let him have his own show, then see how many people tune in. The singing brought an overall Blah to the whole show. I give three stars because I know how hard these skaters train for their skating. I will say this, when Michael quit singing his piano playing was very good,I respect the time he put in learning to to this. But really when I buy a video about skating a want to see the skaters. I also don't like the fact; that the person emceeing is not a skater himself.",1328745600,,577,4.160714285714286
1975341,2,B00016XN02,"I LOVE Scott Hamilton. The reason I love to watch Scott is because he is so full of energy and skates fun-to-watch programs. I was so disappointed in this DVD. I did not know who Michael Feinstein was, MOST of the music was very slow. If you like slow music, you will enjoy this dvd. But if you like high energy skating, you will be dissappointed.",1237766400,3,347,4.2727272727272725
1975342,1,B00016XN02,"The DVD would not play on my DVD player but only on my computer. In addition, you can tell it was spliced because of the poor video playback. I would not recommend this DVD.",1208044800,,173,4.117647058823529
1975343,1,B00016XN02,"I wish I could get my money back on this.  It was all about entertainment and the pianist whose personality I found grating.  A showy night club like atmosphere, not at all what I expected with fine skaters and classical music. The camera kept cutting back to the musician and the whole mood was  Las Vegas like and not world class skating.",1205280000,,340,4.451612903225806
1975344,5,B00016XN02,Scott Hamilton is a genius on ice & this shows that to perfection.  I love the others he has picked to join him as well.  I think ice skating is a beautiful sport to watch & I love it.,1194566400,,184,3.6923076923076925

8007378,5,B00016XN02,"I've always loved to watch ice skating.  I miss it on television now.  It's not advertised as much as back when Scott & all the other were competing and performing.  It's a treat when I do find some on television.  So to find that amazon has some of those shows on dvd's or tape, if possible I try to buy them.  It's such a graceful sport.",1427587200,,339,4.075757575757576
8007379,5,B00016XN02,My son is a young figure skater and got to meet Scott Hamilton.  He really enjoyed watching all of his performances on video.  It helped him incorporate some of Scott's style in his own programs.,1421712000,,195,4.542857142857143
8007380,5,B00016XN02,"This was a gift for my mother, who is a fanatic Scott Hamilton fan. The skating is older, shortly after they were winning medals, and it shows that they never lost their stuff. Mom is thrilled!",1417910400,,193,4.388888888888889

8007382,5,B00016XN02,"Take my favorite skater and my favorite singer and you have a hit.  Wonderful skating by wonderful skaters.  Great Michael Feinstein and banter with the skaters.  There were a few moments where I would have liked to see the camera focused more on the skaters, but all in all, this will be an all time favorite for me.",1396569600,,317,4.431034482758621

8007386,5,B00016XN02,It was great to see the skaters from the past - they know it means to SKATE  it's not all jumpe!  and then to have Feinstein's magical sounds to accompany them - its doesn't get any better.,1368230400,,189,4.081081081081081
