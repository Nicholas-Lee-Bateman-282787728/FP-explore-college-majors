2293231,5,B0009IW8A8,"This program is funny in a cute, almost nostalgic way.  There are gags that are repeated throughout the nine seasons (they must have done something right!) that make you feel included in an inside joke.  Definitely overacted (intentionally and in a good way)  My husband and I enjoy the whole series.",1363996800,,300,4.8431372549019605

2293234,5,B0009IW8A8,"Having lived abroad for several years, I became very appreciative of the British sitcoms. Allo Allo was one of my all time favorites. There is a large turnover rate within the cast for some reason and many of my favorite players were replaced. But the program continued to be very funny. If you like British humor, I highly recommend this series.",1336953600,,346,4.688524590163935
2293235,5,B0009IW8A8,"This is one of the funniest British comedy series of all time! We literally laugh out loud through every episode. We already owned series one and two, so three and four were eagerly anticipated. We love it!!",1209686400,,207,4.621621621621622

In addition to the screamingly funny episodes, there are extras like Cast Bios, TV appearances done by the cast to promote the show, and other items of interest.  It's a must-have for fans of the show, or fans of farce.",1155168000,,364,4.73015873015873
2293243,5,B0009IW8A8,"Wonderful and highly entertaining madcap comedy, set in occupied France during WWII, with twists and turns that boggle the mind, and keep the entire family in splits... we have watched the show OVER and OVER and OVER again and laughed till we cried and almost died. Unfortunately only series 1-4 are currently available for American consumers. Can hardly wait for the remaining series 5-9. Very well done. Extremely clever situations that lead to more complex and hilarious scenarios all of which seem to have been conceived by a brilliant mind. Excellent value for the money. The all-British cast with their French and German accents are brilliant. The German Army and Gestapo portrayals are nothing short of spectacular.",1153094400,2,722,5.17948717948718
2293244,5,B0009IW8A8,"Finally, the long-awaited comedy series is here... volume after volume. The series is a great pleasure to watch, with lots of laughter, ""kinky humor"", lots of slap-stick lines and physical comedy. Super quality television!!! a must-own DVD collection.",1144627200,2,251,5.631578947368421
2293245,5,B0009IW8A8,"This is more of the most brilliantly-written comedy series ever. From the very first episode to the last, all the characters are consistent and hilarious. The plots are clever and each builds on previous episodes. Not a single word is wasted; each is carefully chosen to add something to the story.

It is set in France during WWII. The main character is Rene, played by Gorden Kaye, who owns a cafe, and occupies his days trying to balance getting along with the Germans, the French Resistence, the Communist Resistence, his wife, who thinks she can sing, his mother-in-law, British airmen, various onion-sellers, the Gestapo, and the two lovely waitresses with whom he is having affairs. As the episodes progress, you meet additional characters, who are always consistently hilarious.

As you may have read from other reviews, the ""extras"" here do not really add much, except additional glimpses of several of the Allo Allo actors on British TV game shows. They are worth watching once, but you will prefer watching the hilarious episodes of Allo Allo.

In some ways it's like the British series, ""Are You Being Served."" If you have ever enjoyed a single episode, you'll want to see all of them.  This must be classic great humor, because you want to watch them over and over.",1139529600,7,1278,4.875576036866359
2293246,5,B0009IW8A8,"I love Allo Allo. You just laugh your head off when u see it. I have the collection  and it is worth all the money you are going to spend on it.

So if you find yourself staying in on a Saturday night, this is a great way to spend it.

So if u need a good laugh, this is the thing to watch.

Viva La France",1135382400,5,306,3.5223880597014925
2293247,5,B0009IW8A8,"Allo Allo is one the greats in British comedy.  It is classic and like the best of British it is funny without vulgarity.  The story line is based around a French restaurant owner and his exploits with the resistance (who will only say anything once, inside joke if you purchase) and the Germans occupying the French town.  Renee (the restaurant owner) has a wife that cannot sing worth two pence (pronounced tuppence) but believes she is a world class singer.  His two bar girls are madly in love with him.  A german officer (male) also believes Renee is so charming and irresistable.  Top that off with a Mother in law bedridden with a sex drive of a nineteen year old, two British airmen trying to escape from France with the help of a bungling French resistance, a British spy posing as a French policemen who cannot pronounce or speak proper French (everything is spoken in English with a French accent to symbolize French).  Finally a German commandant in charge of the town trying to hide stolen paintings from Hitler in order to pay for his retirement and a Natzi with a love for wearing womens clothing not to mention his attraction to Helga the Commandants secretary.  All in all it is great classic British comedy, I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the greats like Fawlty Towers, Only Fools and Horses, Open All Hours, Dad's Army and Black Adder.  Watch for appearances by Kenneth Connor from the Carry On movies.  Purchase and enjoy series one and two also, Jim Kindlon",1128729600,12,1491,4.67816091954023
2293248,5,B0009IW8A8,Great humor for the sophisticated viewer. Not bubble gum for the mind. Now if the rest of the series is released it will be a perfect comedy collection.,1127433600,5,152,4.464285714285714
2293249,5,B0009IW8A8,Present day writers should take lessons from this series...humor does not have to be crude and X-rated to be funny. I enjoyed the series when it was on TV on PBS and now again with our teenage children. Cannot wait for the next series!,1127260800,8,235,4.363636363636363
2293250,5,B0009IW8A8,"I first watched Allo Allo in 1996, and I was completely hooked onto it. It has the most creative and novel concept I have seen in a TV show, and the humour can extract some good belly laughs from viewers. I have bought all 3 seasons on DVD and am hoping that BBC releases the remaining 6 seasons too!

Listen very carefully, I shall say this only once...

  PLEASE BBC! Don't keep the fans waiting!!!",1126224000,13,400,4.293333333333333
2293251,3,B0009IW8A8,"This 2 DVD set is of course, as funny as I remember the TV show being.  However the second DVD contains only 2 shows and the rest of it is a chat show from England which discusses the pros and cons of trivialzing the war years with comic French resistance workers and Gestapo officers etc.  Interesting but you would only want to see it one time.  There are also trailers for other DVD's that they want you to buy filling up space on the DVD.  So I think that the set is a bit of rip off considering that the cost is almost $40 with tax for Canadians.",1124841600,15,551,4.074074074074074
2293252,1,B0009IW8A8,This is like sitting through an amateur production where they use the same jokes episode after episode - not edgy - not funny - very unclever.,1124755200,,142,4.5
8061418,5,B0009IW8A8,"""Allo Allo!"" Has been around since 1982 and has just recently become available in the USA on a decent media.

This is series three as the series progresses they take more chances and opportunity to parody just about everyone. There are six episodes that are over before you know it. The episodes are too large for one DVD so they filled the second one with the standard extras. Unfortunately the extras add nothing to the series. I am afraid that we will have to wait some time for the next series.
------------
Basic story is of a caf owner Ren; this is in France during the WWII occupation. He must balance dealing with the local Germans, the Gestapo, the good Resistance, the commie Resistance, having affairs with his female help, dealing with his wife and mother-in-law. Throw in some downed British airmen and some onion soup.
I will not go though this series in detail because for those that have not seen it or if it has been while since viewing the series, the surprise factor and the one liners are worth discovering first hand.
The series two includes the introduction of an English officer that thinks he can speak French and comes out with statements like ""she has great Fartitude""
This is the series where they also nick Helga's knickers with the little swastikas.
One nice thing about this series is that they place the name next to the actor at the end of each episode. Most of the actors are well known out side of this series. I was shocked however to find that Gestapo Herr Otto Flick (Richard Gibson) Played British Capt. Newman in Ken Follett's ""The Key to Rebecca"" (1985) and completely changed his accent.
I was surprised to see Lt. Hubert Gruber (Guy Siner.) in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl (2003.)",1504828800,,1748,4.620578778135048

8061422,4,B0009IW8A8,"If you love British humor and slapstick, this series is for you!!  The characters become more endearing the more you watch.  Love the repeated phrases each character uses in every episode.  Is a bit ""politically incorrect"" today on some issues, but I don't feel it to be insulting because of the time period of the series and filming.",1440806400,,334,4.724137931034483
8061423,5,B0009IW8A8,I only heard of this series but never saw it. I watched a few episodes on youtube and had to buy a few sets. I find it very funny in a nonsense way but it as typical British humor. Every thing they say has a double meaning and it reminds me of Hogans heros but a bit funnier. The Germans are depicted as foolish and highly suspicious of each other. The plots are run on plots and go on from one show to another. But its done well and each show has its own merits. I would recommend it for any one with a good sense of humor.,1432857600,,524,3.861111111111111

8061427,5,B0009IW8A8,"Like series one and two this is a continuation of hilarious goings on in a little French town during WWII.  More creative episodes, just as good as the former ones. I re-run this series for myself about every year and a half.  I never get tired of it.  This is the funniest Brit-com in my book.",1395705600,,294,4.214285714285714
