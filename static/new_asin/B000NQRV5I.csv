8180916,5,B000NQRV5I,"LOVE this DVD, all my 4 kids grew up watching this show. We wake up, while mom getting ready everyone for work and school,kids are watching this show. Bought this DVD for my youngest baby to watch the show in the car. My 6 years old autistic son loves the show and can name all the characters. Awesome characters, funny, plus a bit of science, just perfect for kids under 7 years old.",1462924800,,384,4.273972602739726
8180917,5,B000NQRV5I,Used to be on PBS... my kids loved it.. Im not sure what happened to it.. it was never that big in Canada.,1397779200,,106,3.652173913043478
8180918,5,B000NQRV5I,Personally these are hands down the best shows on pbs... I remember watching these with my oldest son now eight when he was a tiny baby.. The music and characters drew all of us so much I memorized that birthday song for his first birthday and to this day still sing it him. Broke our hearts when they cancelled it. Now we can show his 14 mo old brother and he's getting into then add much as the rest of the family . Truly a great find and if you do buy it!!,1393977600,,459,3.946236559139785

8180920,5,B000NQRV5I,My five and six year old children are able to describe what drives air currents and weather. This video is entertaining and quite educational. It examines ecological events as well as social and emotional concerns of young people. I really like the big world videos.,1244160000,,266,4.933333333333334
8180921,4,B000NQRV5I,"My 2-year-old LOVES this show, but when PBS in our area shifted the broadcast time, we couldn't watch it. The sale price on the videos made it easy and soon we had the whole gang at home. The songs are very catchy, and our son has most of them memorized. The plot conflicts are real, but very low-threat - not scary for toddlers, as some shows can be. The combination of puppetry and green-screen animation is seamless and visually spectacular, although the perpetually saturated colors can be a strain on the eyes after a while. I recommend equal parts of this show and outdoor play.",1222992000,3,584,4.571428571428571
