Gerald Posner and other like minded individuals can't explain the shadows in these photos.

When you look at the shadow that Oswald's body cast behind him it is obvious that the sun was shining directly in his face.  His shadow extends nearly to the fence which is more than 8 feet behind him.

Explain then how the shadown under his nose, and under his eyes, and under the tops of his ears, and every other shadow surrounding his head depicts a light source directly above as though the sun were at high noon.

This undeniable contradiction of the laws of physics tells the critical thinker that something is wrong in these pictures.  When you compare the three published pictures of Oswald and the guns, you will notice that his head is at different angles in all three photos.  Yet when you examine the shadow under his nose closely, you will see that it touches exactly the same point on his upper lip in all three photos.  When you superimpose the images of his face from the three ""different"" photos, the image of his face is exactly the same in all three.

Consider for a moment that the photos are not genuine.  If that is true, then one must conclude that a person (or persons) were motivated to link Oswald to a rifle.  And not just any rifle, they would have had to know in advance what type of rifle would be found in the TCBD on the day of the assassination.  Any person so motivated and with such prior knowledge would by definition be part of a plot to murder the President.  Their obvious motive would have been to frame Oswald for that very crime.

It is clear now why these shadows are so significant.  To assume that these photos are forged is to admit to an emormous consiracy in the in the death of President Kennedy.  It is my opinion that the photos were forged and that this is the best evidence of a conspiracy.

I challange any person to stand in a room directly under a single source of light.  Have another person arrange your position so there is a shadow under your nose as on Oswald's face in these pictures.  Without moving your feet, look behind you.  If by some miracle you see a shadown behind you as in the Oswald photos, then you can say that I am wrong.

Read this book and decide for yourself.  I consider the expert opinion of Robert Groden to be more reliable than anyone either so blindly devoted to the conclusions of the Warren Report or so completely unwilling to believe their eyes.",1219190400,,2504,4.433260393873085
7867820,1,6304290012,"Soon-to-be Presidential assassin Lee Harvey Oswald arranged for his wife, Marina, to take a series of three or four photographs with Lee's Imperial Reflex Duo Lens camera on Sunday, March 31st, 1963, just days after Oswald had acquired (via mail-order) the two weapons that are very likely depicted in these pictures.

Here's a picture of Oswald's Imperial Reflex camera (designated ""CE750"" by the Warren Commission):

[...]

The program contained on this VHS videotape makes the usual attempt to label the photos as ""fakes"" and ""composites""; and, like other similar programs which adhere to the standard ""CT motto"" of -- ""Everything Was Faked In The JFK Case And Cannot Be Trusted"" -- this program fails to ""prove"" a darn thing to advance the notion of fakery within these pictures.

The famous and controversial pictures that were taken by Mrs. Marina Oswald in 1963, which have been dubbed the ""Backyard Photographs"", show Lee Oswald, dressed all in black, holding a rifle (almost certainly the Mannlicher-Carcano weapon that he used to murder President John F. Kennedy eight months after the pictures were snapped). Lee is also holding two Russian newspapers in the photos; plus a revolver and holster are seen as well.

The famous Backyard Photos:

[...]

Many JFK conspiracy theorists firmly believe that all of these black-and-white photographs have been faked in some manner (with a picture of Oswald's head pasted onto the body of an unknown ""conspirator""), in an effort to implicate Oswald in President Kennedy's November 1963 assassination.

However, such conspiratorial notions are utter nonsense for a variety of different reasons....and it's quite easy to prove why the ""Faked Photos"" theory is full of more holes than a Swiss Cheese factory.

The main questions that CTers need to answer if they think the photos have been faked/manipulated are:

1.) How did the plotters/photo-fakers get Marina Oswald to ADMIT to having taken the photos?

2.) How did they get Marina to actually write on the back of one picture?

3.) And how in the world did these clever plotters get Lee Oswald HIMSELF to SIGN one of the photographs?*

* = It was proven to be Lee Oswald's own signature on the photo in which the words ""Hunter of Fascists"" were also written (in Russian; and probably via Marina Oswald's own hand). This fact re. the Oswald signature, all by itself, proves Oswald knew of the existence of the photographs and proves that they are not forgeries.

Plus, there's the inscription ""To my friend George"" (De Mohrenschildt) preceding Oswald's signature on the photo (and the date ""5/IV/63""), matching Oswald's handwriting.

Oswald's statement to the police after his arrest on November 22, 1963 -- when he claimed that the backyard photo he was shown was a composite forgery -- is just one more lie to add to Oswald's lengthy tome of untruths that he told the authorities following JFK's assassination.

4.) Why in the wide, wide world of ""Presidential Assassination Patsy Conspiracy Plots"" would the perpetrators of this photo-faking scheme feel there was any need whatsoever to ""fake"" MULTIPLE pictures that, in essence, depicted the EXACT same thing (i.e., Oswald with guns and Russian newspapers)?

In other words, if we're to buy into the idea of the pictures being fakes, why wouldn't just ONE single snapshot of Oswald holding the assassination rifle have met the photo-forging requirements of this band of Patsy-Framers?

Plus, given many CT beliefs re. the matter, why would these plotters decide to use the EXACT SAME HEAD of Oswald in ALL of the various ""fake"" photos? Did these crooks WANT to get caught red-handed? Or were they just overly cautious (fearing that one or two of the pics might get ""lost"" before November 22nd, so they wanted a few back-ups)?

(See how stupid some of this stuff sounds from the ""pro-conspiracy"" mindset?)

What does all of this suggest to a reasonable person looking objectively at the evidence? --- It indicates that each of the March 1963 Neely Street ""Backyard Photos"" contains a separately-exposed image of Lee Harvey Oswald, and were photos that he, himself, KNEW existed.

------------------------

Here are some more of my random thoughts regarding the absurdity of the ""Faked Photos"" theory (and the craziness of JFK conspiracy talk in general):

When looking back in hindsight, it's quite remarkable at how successful Oswald was in duping many people (post-11/22/63) into actually believing his web of lies. He utters the word ""Patsy"" one time (after an obvious lie at that, that falsehood being his ""Soviet Union"" excuse for being ""taken in"" by the DPD), and everyone suddenly wants to believe him (the man accused of a double-murder)?! Incredible!

He also utters ""That's my head pasted on someone else's body"" -- and, guess what, virtually every CTer within earshot jumps on that bandwagon too -- even though Oswald actually SIGNED one of the pictures he claims was faked! Ridiculous! Talk about the tail wagging the dog!

It's a classic case of a murderer having been caught who is trying anything he can think of to save his own skin. And in Oswald's case, he spouted so many lies to the police after his arrest, it's somewhat difficult to chronicle every one of them (with many of his lies even being said brazenly to the world via Live TV).

Along similar lines, it's futile for conspiracy believers to continue to think that it is Oswald we see in the doorway of the Book Depository in the famous assassination picture taken by James Altgens, when it is known for a fact that it's Billy Lovelady standing there. But this ""fact"" doesn't keep some CTers from still pursuing to this day the false notion that it was Lee Harvey in the doorway.

It's the same with Oswald's obvious guilt in the J.D. Tippit murder. Witness Acquilla Clemmons' testimony of having seen two men involved in the killing of Tippit is NOT a credible account of the event when balanced and weighed against all the OTHER testimony and evidence that tells us: Oswald Murdered Officer Tippit Beyond All Reasonable Doubt! Therefore, it's futile and senseless to continue to search for those ""other Tippit killers"". Because no such killers exist, and never did.

------------------------

I can't quite fully understand why most conspiracy theorists just don't look upon the Backyard Photos as being genuine (which, of course, they are), and then utilize the ""CT"" philosophy that these ""real"" photos have aided the ""Patsy"" plan after the fact (i.e., after the shots were fired by their ""look-alike Oswald"" on the 6th Floor of the Book Depository on November 22, 1963).

That approach makes much more logical sense (if a person insists upon believing in conspiracy that is) than accepting as true the more-illogical approach that has a group of unknown plotters going to the trouble of faking various photos....photos that (in a very real sense) do NO GOOD at all with respect to placing their ""Patsy"" in that sniper's window with a rifle anyway.

Because.....

The police are going to find out ANYWAY (with or without any ""Backyard Photos"") that the revolver and rifle are Oswald's; and they certainly are going to find out about Oswald's Russian connection (i.e., defection) even without the ""Militant"" newspaper popping up in any photos (faked or otherwise).

So, if CTers must believe in a ""plot"" (and they must for some reason), then this would just be one more ""They Got Lucky"" aspect to the plan. Oswald posed for the pictures in March 1963, and the plotters benefitted from them in November.

Just as a lone-assassin believer peripherally benefits from the ""real"" Oswald backyard pictures. They add further circumstantial evidence against Oswald -- much in the very same way that photographs showing O.J. Simpson wearing a certain pair of gloves and certain shoes in TV films provided circumstantial evidence against that double-murderer in the mid-1990s as well.

The Oswald Backyard Photos are/were a ""Bonus"", further implicating the assassin with his weaponry. I cannot understand why the conspiracy advocates don't view these pictures from this same ""These REAL And Unaltered Photos Of Oswald Are A Nice Bonus, But Not Essential"" point-of-view.

------------------------

Marina Oswald testified in front of the Warren Commission on February 3, 1964, and stated at that time that she remembered taking at least one photo of her husband Lee, who was decked out in a black outfit. Marina additionally stated (re. the picture-taking incident): ""I thought he {Lee} had gone crazy."" .....

QUESTION -- ""Was it on a day off that you took the picture?""

MARINA OSWALD -- ""It was on a Sunday.""

QUESTION -- ""How did it occur? Did he {LHO} come to you and ask you to take the picture?""

MARINA OSWALD -- ""I was hanging up diapers, and he came up to me with the rifle and l was even a little scared, and he gave me the camera and asked me to press a certain button.""

QUESTION -- ""And he was dressed up with a pistol at the same time, was he?""

MARINA OSWALD -- ""Yes.""

------------------------

Photo experts for the House Select Committee On Assassinations verified the batch of backyard pics as genuine. A quote from their final report on this photographic matter reads:

""The panel detects no evidence of fakery in any of the backyard picture materials."" -- HSCA Report; Volume VI

Plus: The dates on the newspapers Oswald is holding in the pictures also correspond very closely in time to the date the photos were taken. The papers were dated March 11 and March 24, 1963, perfect timing for the March 31st backyard photo shoot.

The full HSCA verdict re. the Backyard Photo controversy:

[...]

I'd also recommend reading the bottom of Page 106 of Gerald Posner's book ""Case Closed"", where the author tells of his own conversation with Marina Oswald regarding the photos:

""I was very nervous that day when I took the pictures,"" Mrs. Oswald told Posner. ""I can't remember how many I took, but I know I took them and that is what is important. It would be easier if I said I never took them, but that is not the truth.""

So, Marina knows for a fact she took some pictures of Lee that day in Spring 1963 (at least one photo). And Lee Oswald signed the back of one of the pictures, thereby verifying without doubt that he, himself, was aware of the photos -- which, of course, thereby renders his comment to police about them being ""fakes"" an outright lie.**

** = To think otherwise is to actually believe that there were a COMBINATION of ""Real"" and ""Fake"" Backyard Photos in existence, that ALL (somehow) ""melded"" together to show an identical overall scene (with an identical-looking person holding weapons, newspapers, and with a gun belt and holster). Sound like a logical conclusion to anyone? I rather doubt it.

------------------------

A couple of additional semi-troublesome conspiracy-related complications for which CTers ought to be required to provide reasonable and believable explanations (other than just the standard shoulder-shrugging ""We Don't Have To Prove Any Details As To HOW It Happened, We Just KNOW It Did Happen"" type of response) would be these items:

1.) Who was the Oswald ""stand-in"" that we see in the so-called ""fake"" photos of ""Oswald"" standing in his back yard? If the only part of the ""real"" Oswald in the pics is his head, then whose body are we looking at in the photos? If it's an imposter, the plotters were able to get a stand-in whose body matched Oswald's perfectly.

2.) WHERE and HOW did these photo-tampering plotters come upon the photograph of Oswald's ""head"" that was supposedly plastered onto someone else's body in the various backyard pics?

After all, a picture of Oswald's head WAS needed in such a CT scenario. So where did this picture come from? Who supplied it? Or was this, too, supposedly stolen from Oswald's personal belongings (undetected), along with the rifle, pistol, and camera? Or did the conspirators take Lee's picture with their own ""Patsy Cam"" sometime prior to 03/31/63, instead of stealing one from Lee's own property?

Or -- Did the plotters have a CHOICE of ""Oswald Head Pictures"" to choose from? Because it appears they WERE able to steal (or snap on their own) a good ""match"" to plant on the body of the ""Fake Oswald"" in the pics.

Plus, in the scenario of the plotters swiping an already-existing pic of Oswald -- The number of readily-available Lee Oswald photos (circa 1963), showing a RECENT depiction of Oswald (that is, a 23-year-old Oswald in early 1963 and not a younger Marine Corps-era 17-year-old LHO, circa 1957 or so) certainly must have been limited in number....wouldn't you think? After all, the guy wasn't exactly a male fashion model, having his picture taken every five minutes.

But, then too, according to most conspiracy buffs, I suppose these little picky details don't matter in the least .... because it would appear that there were no limits restricting the amount of massive evidence-tampering, bullet-planting, witness strong-arming, and photo-manipulation that could be undertaken and successfully pulled off with ease by these ace conspirators and cover-up operatives. Evidently, no amount of covert evidence-fakery was beyond the talents and capabilities of these crackerjack henchmen/assassins.

After all, it was apparently this same amazing team of ""Patsy-Framers"" that was actually able to fool most of the world by shooting JFK with many different guns and then have the whole nine yards pinned on one lone loser in the Depository who (per many CTers) never even fired a shot. Heck, faking a few photos in Oswald's back yard I guess would, indeed, have been a walk in the park compared to what these Kreskins did on November 22nd in Dealey Plaza!

Anyway, more food for ""Conspiratorial Craziness"" thought.

------------------------

The overall skepticism displayed by conspiracy theorists towards ALL figures of authority connected with the JFK murder case has reached (as my main man, author/lawyer Vincent Bugliosi, would say) ""Olympian proportions"" in some CT circles.

And I believe such massive, wide-sweeping, all-encompassing skepticism re. the ""official"" findings about every single aspect of the John F. Kennedy case is unfounded and just plain ""wishful CT thinking"".
