20 years ago (in the period I call ""My Youth"") I worked part time as a clerk at Tower Records. I fell in love with the music of Rued Lanngaard and saw in the catalog an opera called ""Antikrist."" I had to have it. Unfortunately, we couldn't ever obtain a copy, but the idea of it stuck in my head forever.

Needless to say, I did a double take when recently I stumbled upon a DVD of Lanngaard's ""Antikrist."" I've watched it twice now and must say, after my initial letdown of not seeing Satan himself wreaking hell on earth, I'm growing to absolutely love the piece.

The performance is from the Royal Danish Opera and it is a fascinatingly odd production. An almost entirely bare stage (enormous) with occasional props (tables, chairs, the organ, etc.) creates an air of vastness to the proceedings - a wise choice by director, Staffan Holm. I must admit initially the set reminded me of the vast Spanish Riding School and, initially, I kept waiting for the arrival of the Lipizzaner Stallions to give us a nice Grand Quadrille!

Rather than the evil, sadistic opus I was hoping for, Lanngaard's opera is almost more of an oratorio, a meditation if you will, contemplating the Antichrist's effect on modern society. The ideas embraced by Lanngaard may have been a bit shocking when he penned his opera, but today, they wouldn't be out of place being discussed in Sunday School.

The cast is dressed mostly in solemn black, with a turn of the 19th century feel, lending a church parable - ""let's put on a show"" quality which feels strangely right. With no recurring characters, those needing a typical linear-style operatic tale might need to look elsewhere, but those wanting to experience something new (circa 1920's) will find plenty to fascinate and running at a mere 96 minutes, it's relatively painless.

Musically, Lanngaard's glorious, sometimes bombastic score, owes an enormous debt to Wagner and Strauss and fans of these composers, should have no problem wrapping their ears around Lanngaard's very tonal core. The Danish National Symphony Orchestra under Thomas Dausgaard along with the cast of fine Danish singers all seem to be having a grand old time - and who wouldn't! Most of the names are unfamiliar, but many will recognize Poul Elming (he of the Kupfer Berlin Parsifal fame), but almost all of the singing is uniformly exquisite with biggish voices from attractive Danes in some big BIG music.

The DVD also features a documentary which I've not yet watched, but which sounds rather interesting.

I really recommend this!

8068882,5,B0009X24RK,"The libretto is weird and I didn't like. But ... the music is very good. What is odd is that the CD with the music only is more expensive than the DVD. So buy this DVD, turn the TV off if you want, and enjoy the music. By the way, I suggest to listen lo Langgaard's symphonies too.",1391731200,,281,3.8620689655172415
8068883,1,B0009X24RK,After experiencing this DVD my opinion of the composer Rued Langgaard has not changed. There is a reason why he was revising this piece after so many rejections... It is so mediocre and uninspired that this performance while dedicated and sincere comes off as pompous and trite. The stage direction is just absurd at times bordering on comedy. All the other reviews gushing about how important his music is are just dead wrong. There is a reason his music is seldom performed outside Denmark. It's second rate and badly written. A great disappointment! Buyer Beware!,1305763200,,566,4.968421052631579
8068884,1,B0009X24RK,"The reviews in under for this stated that later copies of this were in fact compatible with US players, so I took a gamble...and lost. The disc will play an opening credit & nothing else. I tried contactin De Capo, but never got a reply. Faulty disc, poor customer service.",1296518400,2,273,4.48
8068885,5,B0009X24RK,"I'm serious! Let the music tell you its own meaning. Or else choose the CD rather than the DVD. The music is magnificent, both emotional and sensuous. In compositional idiom, it's ""Late Nordic Romanticism"" preponderantly influenced by Richard Strauss, but don't let its 'lateness' distract you from its originality. There are passages in it far bolder than Strauss ever approached; there are premonitions in it of 'minimalism' and of the 'tintinnabulation' style of Arvo Prt and other European modernists still composing today. Heard but not seen, Langgaard's 'Antikrist' is an immense choral symphony, on a scale and of an oral impact comparable to the choral symphonies of Gustav Mahler. The voices are instruments of a specific timbre and the words are musical articulations, to be heard but certainly not to be read.

Alas, however, ""we"" have to deal with the libretto and the dramaturgy of this ""church opera"" that was first composed in 1921 and not staged until 1999. Assuming you have this DVD in your sweaty hands, again I urge you to hear it first without the subtitles. The overture is powerful stuff. Then you'll see a stark set, almost bare but inside what might be a church. A group of somber Danish peasants -- recognizably religious pietists -- are gathering for a communal supper... a communion? ... which apparently evolves into a queer cult ritual, possibly a dramatization of the cult's doctrines. Eventually teh cult is 'challenged' by nefarious 'others' -- a slick top-hatted schemer and a scarlet harlot, plainly representing evil. The cult ritual ends vividly in the music but rather uncertainly in the staging.

If you then listen again, with the subtitles on, you'll have, I think, a good deal less coherent understanding of the action than you had from simply hearing the music. The libretto is gibberish to my ears, as it must have been to the impresarios of Langgaard's lifetime who rejected the 'opera' again and again. Langgaard was the product of a extreme pietist upbringing. His reactionary hatred for 'modernity' was total and rancorous, even after he claimed to reject the orthodox theology of his youth. ""Antikrist"" is a perfervid symbolist declamation of Langgaard's vision of Apocalypse. The central figure of the staging, whom you might well have taken for the pastor of the pietist flock, is in fact identified as the Antikrist - Satan - and his flock represent as the depravities and debaucheries of ""modern times"".

Let m confess that ""apocalyptic"" religiosity is hateful to me. When I consider what's ""wrong"" with modern times, apocalyptic thinking heads my list. If you, dear opera fan, have an opener receptivity to Jeremiads of the apocalyptic sort, you may be able to make more sense of Langgaard's libretto than I can. Historically, I have to acknowledge that apocalyptic visions -- some derived from orthodox religions and some from pure Expressionism -- were prominent in the music, painting, and literature of the 1920s, following the reality of devastation that was The Great War. And such visions of cataclysm grew more vivid as World War 2 crept closer, like William Butler Yeats's ""beast slouching toward Bethlehem to be born."" One of my favorite writers of that era, the Austrian Joseph Roth, wrote an apocalyptic screed against modernity which he titled ""The Antichrist."" Langgaard's opera and Roth's screed have a lot in common, beginning with deliberately ecstatic incoherence. Their ultimate model -- the Biblical text called 'The Revelations of Saint John' -- sets the bar very high for apocalyptic raving.

The singers in this production, all Danish, cannot be faulted, either musically or dramatically. Likewise the orchestra, under the baton of Thomas Dausgaard, the most convincing advoacte for the music of Rued Langgaard. You'll find that Dausgaard is the conductor on most of the best recordings of Langgaard's symphonies and symphonic works. I hesitate to recommend this music to anyone who doesn't already have a passion for 20th C musical experimentation. How ironic it is, by the way, that the music of modernity-hating Rued Langgaard should be so preternaturally ""modernist"" in every way!",1294963200,3,4161,5.150887573964497

8068887,5,B0009X24RK,"An excellent production of Langgaard's amazing score. If you want to read about the merits of the opera and performance, check the reviews under the standard DVD of this item.

My note is to warn people who may be considering a purchase of the blu-ray that if you reside in the US, you need to be careful to get the later release done by Da Capo.  The company very kindly replaced my disc in August 2010 when I wrote them to inquire why it wouldn't play on my Oppo Blu-Ray when it was listed as ""all regions.""  Turns out their manufacturer made a mistake with the initial batch and region-locked them.  They were already in the process when I wrote them and sent me a replacement in about two days.  So buy this blu-ray with confidence now. But if any vendor out there (likely Amazon would not be an issue) has old stock and you find it won't play, just contact the distributor.  They were great.  And this is a fantastic disc. Truly!",1280188800,5,934,4.364161849710983
8068888,5,B0009X24RK,"Rue Langgard's ""Antikrist"" is a beautiful and highly original work written almost nine decades ago to a libretto of the composer's own making.  It was revised and repeatedly rejected by the Danish National Opera (until this 2002 production) because the libretto was ""unsuitable.""  As Bendt Nielsen puts it in his excellent introduction:  ""There are no recurrent characters, there is no plot in the traditional sense, and the opera consists to a great extent of monologues.""

Langgard grew up in a strict Christian household which viewed traditional music, e.g., Beethovan's and Wagner's, as providing a divine harmony that helped bring man closer to the divine.  However, more modern, dissonant composers (e.g., Puccini, Richard Strauss, and Carl Nielsen) were doing the devil's handiwork; Langgard's parents cautioned their son against them.  They remained powerful temptations.  The ""Antikrist"" became the perfect opportunity to explore those temptations within a pious structure and a harmonious context.

The production is excellent.  Leading from the pit, Thomas Dausgaard brings clarity, energy, and grace to the score.  The ensemble cast sing beautifully and portray their characters skillfully; Staffan Holm, the stage director, bears special mention.  His insights bring a coherence and even a measure of dramatic tension to a work that could easily have appeared chaotic. A unique feature of this recording is the option of viewing the performance with Holm'and Dausgaard's running commentary appearing at the base of the picture in lieu of libretto translation. The camera work is effective, and the quality of the sound reproduction is outstanding.",1198540800,3,1660,5.573705179282869
8068889,5,B0009X24RK,"This is just great if you like heavy dark stuff with touches of sublime ethereal beauty. Costumes and set are understated and perfect, the *hore of Babylon is bathed in red and truly stunning. Music is prosaic, melodious, and very accessible. Recommended if you like: Rautavaara's Rasputin, Kaija Saariaho's L'Amour de loin, Verdi's Requiem, or sacred music with dark themes.",1186185600,3,375,5.266666666666667
8068890,4,B0009X24RK,"Langgaard's very accessible and often electrifying score is given its due by a thoroughly committed cast and orchestra under a conductor who nicely calibrates the ebb and flow of the piece. The composer called this work a ""church opera,"" but it really is a series of loosely connected scenes structured in the style of a medieval mystery play, with allegorical characters articulating a deliberately opaque text. The staging is visually arresting, but by all means be sure to listen at some point to the commentary, which is, no pun intended, a revelation.",1158969600,4,556,5.054347826086956
