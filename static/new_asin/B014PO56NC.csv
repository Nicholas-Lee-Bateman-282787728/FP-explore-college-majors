7420308,5,B014PO56NC,This is a great kid friendly workout DVD! Jalen (the host) made a live appearance at our local gym and did the workout DVD with the kids. I'll tell you what... The kids had a blast!!!  Easy and definitely doable workout that got all the kids heart rates pumping.  If you care about fitness and want to instill these good habits in your kids pick up this DVD. Can't beat the price!  http://buff.ly/1LOlaLA,1440979200,3,404,4.506849315068493

I like how much exercise is packed into each session and that it can be used in short segments, or for a longer period of exercise.
My grandson likes the ""water breaks"", too.",1497398400,,325,4.258064516129032

8731498,5,B014PO56NC,"Excellent, safe and kid friendly!!! Fitness 4 Kids is fun way to keep the kids active and entertained. My girls 6 and 8 yrs old just have a blast and the video teaches in a safe and memorable way. Host Jalen Jones does an excellent job keeping the audience attention.
 I highly recommend you get this video for your children",1465171200,3,324,4.4

8731502,3,B014PO56NC,It was just okay. Jalen Jones was boring and monotone. The workout intensity was average. My 12 yr old daughter said it was just okay and she would rather look for a different workout video.,1455494400,,190,4.457142857142857
