609997,5,6303213332,"Humorous story about a contemporary Native American careerist squaring his ethnic loyalties and identity with career demands. Greene is entertaining, and it's great to see Indian humor shine through and characters who aren't stereotypes.",1022630400,12,237,6.0
609998,2,6303213332,"I had to return the tape because of poor tape quality.  The movie is pretty good, but the tape quality is very bad.",996192000,5,115,4.0
609999,4,6303213332,"As usual Graham Greene is very likeable and does a fine job.  The story is interesting and entertaining.  However,  the audio and music tracks are  horrible.  Nothing  like a distorted audio to make you quessy and take away  from one's enjoyment.",967248000,6,246,4.853658536585366
610000,5,6303213332,"""Medicine River"" is one of those ""sleepers"" that deserves the sort of awakening that comes from exposure to a large and appreciative audience.  There's none of the ""Noble Savage""  stereotyping (except by tribal people making jokes).  Nor are we awash in  the tragedies of rez life.  Instead, there's this wonderfully serendipitous  journey of discovery.  Things don't always work out as the Grahame Greene  character initially thinks or hopes, but that's part and parcel of the  serendipity.  If you like films like ""Local Hero"" (another  sleeper), you'll go for this small but memorable gem.",961372800,35,592,5.258064516129032
610001,5,6303213332,"I watched because I liked G. Greene and Sheila Tousey.  But now I'm in love with Louise Heavyman.  Tousey's portrayal of this character was right on the mark.
I realize that it is the closeness of this group of  characters and the feeling of kinship that has made me sit and watch this  movie at least once a week.",954979200,8,314,4.271186440677966
610002,3,6303213332,"this wonderful made movie, show me the talents of these actors. the story line was slow but was real life adventure of the rez. this is a movie to add to your collection of native films.",954979200,5,186,4.194444444444445
610003,5,6303213332,"A delightfully funny NATIVE AMERICAN film that many native people have enjoyed. It shows for once that not all reservations and people on reservations have drug and alcohol problems. There should be more films of  this type, that show the native people as they really are. A kind and  loving people that enjoy life.",918086400,15,315,4.814814814814815
610004,1,6303213332,"It is surprising to find that Thomas King wrote the screenplay for this,  because he has ruined his own book! The film bares no relation to the  intricate narrative of the novel, and is an unfunny and uninteresting MESS.  END",903052800,,225,4.575
610105,5,6303213332,"This movie was great. I rented it ages ago, and liked it so much I bought it on VHS. I was waiting for this movie to be picked up by DVD, and it didn't happen. Hopefully, someone high up will pick up the rights to this movie and do the right thing and transfer this to a digital media, as I don't have a VHS anymore to watch this movie anymore. One of my favorite Graham Greene movies!",1315267200,,385,3.948717948717949
610106,5,6303213332,"I have loved this movie for years and I have it on VHS, but the problem is that this delightful Canadian movie has never been converted to DVD. This means that with modern blu-ray and DVD technology, I can no longer play VHS tapes on my machine. Therefore, even though I own the movie, I have lost the ability to watch it because it is only available in an outdated format.
This is something like having old musical cassettes compared with CD's; most people don't play tapes anymore and tape players are considered to be dinosaurs now. The VHS format is also going the way of the dinosaurs. The technology has changed and this lovely movie needs to be brought up to date and put in DVD format soon.
 As for the movie itself, it is warm, funny, very human and a joy to watch. If you can play the VHS tape, I highly recommend this movie for Graham Greene fans, for fans of romantic comedies, and for anyone who just enjoys a fun movie. Buy this movie, for sure!
This doesn't change the fact that we need this movie in DVD format so those of us who have left VHS technology behind but love ""Medicine River"" can watch it again!!",1310774400,,1124,4.327014218009479
610107,5,6303213332,"i have seen it before and i liked it and the cast.  i wanted to add it to my collection for viewing again sometime later.  i was upset that it was not on dvd, maybe another time.",1306886400,,178,3.7837837837837838
610108,5,6303213332,"I've seen this movie many times and it never gets old.  If you want a realistic version of life from a Native American perspective, this is your movie.  Solid cast, fun soundtrack, and all the ""character"" you might want.  Definitely recommended for high school and college level cultural studies classes.  Don't miss this movie!",1274572800,,328,5.018518518518518
610109,5,6303213332,Graham Greene-what can i say just a great actor in any movie. this movie is one that you watch over and over and you still laugh at the same things as you did the first time you watch it. one of all time favorites a real gem.,1231286400,,225,3.8085106382978724
610110,4,6303213332,"Hi - I am simply agreeing and sharing some thoughts with the others from the prior reviews.
Though I haven't seen this movie, Graham Greene is one of the best actors around. I've seen him in least 5 movies--and you're right he has great humor, one of his best parts of his acting abilities which puts a 'feather in his cap' so to speak.
Yes, and I too would like to see this movie go to DVD format. Why do some movies take so long to get there? Let's hope soon, this one will get with the times.

610111,5,6303213332,"This movie has heart, soul and humor.  I would love to see it on DVD, have been waiting and waiting.  If you like movies like ""Milagro Bean Field War"" you'll love ""Medicine River"".  Graham Greenes character goes on a journey that takes him back to family, friends and the understanding of where his heart is.  Home.",1142812800,7,315,4.571428571428571
610112,5,6303213332,"I can't understand why this movie has not made it to DVD yet, when movies like ""The Business of Fancy Dancing"" is offered on DVD and for rental in many Blockbusters around North America, and ""Medicine River"" is a million times better and easier to  understand than ""The Business of Fancy Dancing"".  This movie is one of the best movies around that describes what it's like to live on a Reservation, every Native American Culture Class I've taken and visted has mentioned, recommended or shown this movie in relation to discovering current ideas and lifestyles of the Native Indian of North America (despite the fact that it takes place in Canada).  The characters are well rounded and blend together to create a fun and enjoyable adventure and story.  I am waiting on pins and needles for this movie to be released on DVD but it feels like it is falling on deaf ears or at this rate eyes. Perhaps if enough people write in we can get them to finally release it on DVD.

But in the mean time I higly recommend you get the video to tide you over till then.",1124841600,10,1054,4.46875
610113,5,6303213332,"I use this film in my Native American Images in Film course when I teach; it was one of the first movies to reach out beyond some  of the stereotypes of our people and reveal us as real folk with real hearts and real human challenges and the humour to get through it...Sheila Tousey, Tom Jackson--in fact, every actor in here-- does us proud (and half of them remind me of family or folk I know...)as characters, as actors and as ani'yvnwiya--""real people"".",1085788800,16,457,4.506024096385542
610114,4,6303213332,"I thought the convolutions over the fella buying the basketball jerseys and how he went about paying for those jerseys was amazingly similar to personal experience.  the movie properly addressed individual patterns on returning home and the general ""what's going on"" thoughts many have upon returning home after living in the city for a time.  the movie was great for that.",1049846400,9,373,5.098360655737705

7842031,5,6303213332,"LOVE THIS MOVIE.!!!!!!  You don't have to be an American Indian to love this movie - it is the story and how well the actors did their jobs to present this movie that made this movie loveable. The majority of actors were American Indians: including, Graham Greene and a few others that I recognized from Thunderheart.  Graham Greene did another exceptional job ( I have seen him in Dances With Wolves, Thunderheart and Maverick).  I wish I could get this movie in DVD format though.",1397260800,,482,4.647058823529412
7842032,4,6303213332,I saw this movie many years ago and was happy to find it for sale on Amazon (even though a VHS format). Graham Greene is excellent in this story.
