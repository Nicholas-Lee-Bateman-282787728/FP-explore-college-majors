8764232,4,B01GWDRQ0U,"I had heard about this movie for years, but had never seen it.  I read that the full, uncut original version was available on this DVD set, so I went for it.  I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the film - script, production, performances.

I've always liked Christopher Lee and Edward Woodward and they were up their best work in this film.  It seems to have gotten the reputation of a horror film, and it has its horror aspects, but there's more to it than that, including a subtext that addresses intolerance and also fanaticism, the herd mentality, and the nature of cults, which seems quite appropriate right now.

None of these characters is particularly likable, but they are engaging and interesting, flaws and all.

The restored scenes have been taken from a print of lesser quality, but they are perfectly watchable and do not take up much of the footage.  I recommend that you watch the full, original version, although the DVD includes the edited version as well.

I don't want to give away anything for those who have not yet seen it, but do recommend that you give it a chance if you are into horror or occult films or just the mysterious kind that have you uneasy throughout, even if you're not sure just why.

NOTE:  The picture shown here is not the same cover as the copy I received.  However, I'm guessing it is the same package as it is a 2-disc set with the full original version included.",1494115200,,1424,4.5234375
