8026253,5,B0002CX116,"This film (along with Loseida youtbe footage) is likely one of the best primary sources for piecing together what New York City's authentic Alphabet City/Lower East Side culture was like in the 1970's and 1980's.  Clearly a far cry from the Gaga-era pop culture commodity successfully marketed to Midwest hipsters who now pay $3k/month to live in an ""edgy"" neighborhood.  Its not exactly a documentary, and scenes can come across as quite campy to those who knew the area firsthand.  But it is most valuable as documentary material for a time a place that will likely never recur since the massive centralization of local gov't. power in US socty that began in the 1990's.  Priceless for its rarity, but worthless as entertainment for devotees of mass media/pop culture.
Apparently Johnny Thunders was also a primary focus of the film when filming began, and a bit of the footage appears in Thunders' biopics like Born to Lose and the intro to Looking for Johnny. John Spacely also appeared in ""Sid and Nancy"", was involved in the beginnings of the Iboga treatment for addiction conceived in NYC, as well as Punk magazine.  The Punk era LES actually used to be a rather small com'ty where cross-contamination was common.",1507161600,4,1220,4.902912621359223
8026254,1,B0002CX116,"this is a very excellent documentary.  I'm glad I special ordered this.  It is very gut wrenchingly real.  This is perfect to be viewed by anyone, but even better to be shown to young kids in school.  It's a real story about the life of junkies, and how their entire world is to be lived only to find their next fix.  Highly recommended!",1503273600,,337,4.285714285714286

8026258,1,B0002CX116,This movie has no plot obviously the character is severely addicted drug user whom I believe died not long after the the completion of this film. Although it has a gritty 80s feel to it and there's lots of footage of him shooting up and it could be used as a good educational device for eighth graders this is a film that will leave you with nothing but depression and a strong sense of what a wonderful job they did cleaning up most of New York City since the 1980s drugs are bad and they'll ruin your life and watching this documentary will definitely make you sad unless you're high on heroin then it might be quite entertaining but my advice is to skip it all and go for a good walk respectfully Johnny Irish,1353974400,2,712,4.281481481481482
8026259,4,B0002CX116,THIS IS A GOOD DOCUMENTARY ABOUT A REAL LIFE HEROIN ADDICT NAMED JOHN SPACELY. IT FOLLOWS HIM IN A REAL LIFE SETTING IN NEW YORK IN THE 1980'S. THE ONLY THING THAT SUCKS ABOUT THE FILM IS ITS A LITTLE ''DULL'' AND ''DARK'' DO TO THE POOR QUALITY OF TECHNOLOGY AND CAMERAS BACK THEN I GUESS. BUT OTHER THEN THAT THIS WAS A GOOD ''REAL LIFE'' DOCUMENTARY ON WHAT ITS LIKE TO BE HOOKED ON DOPE. THIS IS AS REAL AS IT GETS!!!  HE'S REALLY GETTING HIGH AND DESTROYING HIS LIFE DEEPER IN THIS FILM. A FEW MONTHS AFTER THIS FILM WAS MADE JOHN SPACELY (THE MAIN PERSON IN THE FILM) DIED AS A RESULT OF A HEROIN OVERDOSE.,1233187200,3,612,4.142857142857143
8026260,2,B0002CX116,"I attempted to watch this film with my sister a few weeks ago and we couldn't get past the first 20 minutes.  It starts out very dull and disjointed, hard to follow, and rather than waste another night on another poor movie, we put in something else.  I'll give it another go later but I don't expect much better.",1220572800,,313,4.288135593220339
8026261,4,B0002CX116,"Story of a Junkie follows the real-life drug-addled John Spacely as he worms his way through New York City's filthiest gutters, trash heaps and sewers in search of his next heroin fix.  Director Kowakski seamlessly weaves fact with fiction to successfully build a cinematic experience that is as close to the day to day life of a junkie as most will ever want to see.  It is subversive and darkly poetic in a harrowing manner that lends itself perfectly to its nightmarish course of study.  Occasionally, `Junkie' is sad, even pathetic; and then at other times it is oddly amusing.  The near unending parade of graphic images that careen across the screen for its 78 minute duration leaves viewers' nerves stripped red and raw.  Spacely mainlines time after time with the camera kept unflinchingly tight on the action, leaving one to believe that the director had some major issues to exorcize by way of his chosen subject.  Whether or not director Kowakski found a conclusion to his plight is unknown but what is known is that John Spacely died shortly after the filming of `Junkie' was completed.

This Troma DVD contains a bevy of extras that include: Audio commentary by the film's director, theatrical trailers, tons of sneak previews and even a music video by the death metal act  Entombed.",1101168000,13,1296,4.859090909090909
8026262,4,B0002CX116,"I first saw this film in a preview and thought it was some sort of eighties joke.  When I found it at the video store and read it was a Troma release, I was convinced. This is no Toxic Avenger though (Although thats a very good movie for different reasons). This movie is very good.  Apparently the actors are all real people from the street recreating actual scenes from the main characters life.  This is probably not entirely true but the movie has a very real documantary feel and the direction is  raw but wholly convincing. The movie does seem a little long though and consists almost entirely of dialogue but is one of the better movies about drugs I have seen and it would be interesting to see more of this directors work. This is my first review and only an opinion so Internet geeks and film buffs who want to discredit me for not talking about certain camera angles or production values or whatever, restrain yourself.  I'm just someone who liked the movie and reccomends it.",986688000,27,987,4.522471910112359
