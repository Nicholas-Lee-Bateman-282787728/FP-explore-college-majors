427729,3,6302068983,I lived in Durham N.C. and I am signed with Finn cannon casting I filmed on this set for 10 days and got to know Danny Aiello pretty good during those days on about the 4th or 5th day there was a small commotion on the set with the director wanting a certain extra to do a scene the P.A came out to the extras pool and grab this one guy but when they entered the house Lasse Halstrom thru a little fit and started out to the extras for himself as he made his way to us it seemed as if the other people around me backed off as if I did something wrong and to my surprise Lasse grab me put his arm on my shoulder and quitely explained what he wanted me to do saying i was the person for this scene with  Holly Hunter Griffin Dunne  I was to make a move to make the room (kitchen) we were filming in appear larger then it was  (as the camera rolled forward I was to make a move turn and act as if  the room was bigger  before we shot Ms. Hunter warned me that the camera weighed appox. 500lbs and to be careful it didn't roll on to my foot no rehearsal Lasse entered the room yelled action we all did the scene on the first take.

427732,5,6302068983,"Once Around is one of my all time favorite films that I found accidentally one night that I couldn't sleep. I was skimming channels  and there it was; it melted my heart. For me it's up there with The Thorn Birds and The Notebook. I may want to give this copy a 4-star rating because it has no subtitles, which I desperately need. I find that cinematic sounds fluctuate badly and I often lose much dialog, So, subtitles help me immensely. This may be my own fault however...I'm not certain that I read the details through. Next time I purchase a DVD online, I will be sure to follow through and perhaps send the seller an email.

The seller did a great job, though. The DVD arrived very quickly and I sat right down to watch it. I made both my daughters sit too, to their reluctance, and they got hooked within the first few minutes.",1394236800,2,833,4.333333333333333

His blue eyes twinkle with love for this girl, her family and for life.  One of the things I most like about the film is that we are never sure if ""Sam,"" the Dreyfus character, is for real or not.  I kept thinking that he might run out on her or turn out to be a criminal or something.  She goes with her heart, takes a big chance, and.....well you have to watch it to find out.  The characters are all so realistic...I loved seeing their varying and varied reactions to larger-than-life, improbable Sam Sharpe.",1373760000,,646,4.525862068965517

Sam is crude, wealthy, and full of love. He shows her how she can spread her wings and while still loving her family, be her own person.

He gives her roots and wings without guilt. He takes her on an adventure where she has to decide if she wants to live her life or the one her parents think she should live.  He provides her with unconditional love.

Yeah, the movie goes up and down and backwards and forward, has situations that don't really make sense, but if you watch it and just pay attention to Renatta and Sam, you'll get it.",1340150400,4,700,4.4453125

With excitement, I purchased this DVD.  Being the busy mom I am with a toddler around the house, I waited more than 30 days before opening this DVD to watch it.  I was very much disappointed, and disgusted, that there were no subtitles on it.  And yes, I know how to use subtitles.  I was born deaf and it's the only reason I would buy movies, or watch TV.

427834,5,6302068983,"I've seen this movie no less than thirty times and it gets me everytime.  This is one of my top five favorites, and I hope it becomes one of yours, too!

Renatta Bella's world is turned upside down the day her sister, Jan, marries.  She escapes her sorrow by attending a timeshare-selling seminar in Jamaica, where she and Sam Sharpe, a successful salesman, fall in love at first sight.  Her world is turned back around, while her Italian family is about to be thrown for a loop.

It is a May-December whirlwhind romance.  Renatta returns home to Boston, where the traditional, Italian Bella's have a difficult time acclimating to Sam's generousity and grab-the-bull-by-the-horns style.  While he is clearly not going anywhere, making Renatta not only secure, but more enamoured of Sam, those same traits are intrusive to the Bella's conservative and tight-knit family.

Sam, Renatta, and her family must all learn to accept love without judgment.  Love is a gift, and so is family.  These are lessons that is learned by all, and when hard times come, all involved come together.

Danny Aiello (Joe) and Gena Rowlands (Marilyn) are perfect as the loving Bella patriarchs.  The on-screen chemistry between Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss will leave you with a new understanding and appreciation for Frank Sinatra's ""Fly Me To The Moon"".",1316131200,4,1337,5.0

427898,2,6302068983,"I started watching this film during a commercial of a baseball game.  I got hooked on it in the 7th inning, unusual because we were winning,  and was glad we won, because I couldn't turn off the film.

Though my favorite films with R. Dreyfuss are Close Encounters and The Goodbye Girl, I was a bit shocked at how old Dreyfuss looked in this film.  But even though I missed the first part, and it took me a while to get the hang of it, I couldn't turn it off.  Interesting, because I'm not sure if I liked it or not. My father's family are of Lithuanian descent, though because they were Jews, they were not considered real Lithuanians.  No matter how long Jews lived in any country in eastern Europe, they were never accepted as part of the country they lived in. And in some Eastern European countries they were forced to live in ghettos even as late as the late 1800's, which is why so many Jews from that part of Europe came to America or Sweden in the late 1800s's as my family did. In any case, I saw no relationship between my Jewish grandparents and this Lithuanian man. We were far more like the Italians than the Lithuanians.

In fact, I couldn't understand this guy and his strange ways. I was sympathetic to the Italian family for not understanding him.  It was a nice romance, I guess, but with one messy problem following another, I could have done without a sad ending too.  So, I'm not sure if I liked the picture or not.  The other thing was that Dreyfuss looked about 40 years older than Hunter, and Hunter's faster than lightening attraction to him seemed very odd. I just couldn't understand that attraction, not only because of the age difference, but because Dreyfuss acted so bizarre. Maybe it's because I missed the first part of the film.  I'm thinking about ordering it just so I can figure that out.  I recognized the sister as the wise cracking Kit De Luca from Pretty Woman. She does that kind of smart ass role much better than the depressing sister in this film. Well, that's horseracing.",1282435200,,2019,4.456521739130435

Filmed on location in Boston, MA and North Carolina (the Bella house was in Durham, NC, and the big wedding scene was in the Governor's Mansion in Raleigh, NC), the various scenes blend together seamlessly.  Casting is superb as the actors give you a sense that you're peeking into the lives of an ordinary family.  Before it's over, you're sure to want Danny Aiello and Gena Rowlands to be your mom & dad.

427937,5,6302068983,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen.

I loved everything about it: the acting, directing, and screenplay are top-notch.  Richard Dreyfus knocked me out with his brilliant, ought-to-get-an-Academy-Award performance as the Lithuanian suitor.  He is so intensely outgoing, he wants so much to embrace and touch people that it hurts to watch him.  He is vibrant, enthusiastic, life-loving and warm, but one of the pivotal themes of the movie is that he is socially very clumsy.  Typically, in a social situation Dreyfuss gives it his all with zeal and falls flat on his face.

There are equally brilliant performances by Danny Aiello as the bride-to-be's father and Holly Hunter as the bride to be.

The story is about an Italian-American woman from an upper-middle-class family in Winchester, Massachusetts.  I mention the location because one of the charms of the movie is its attachment to place.  Not only does Holly Hunter carry off the Boston accent perfectly (often attempted, seldom achieved), but the subtle social nuances are embroidered in the story.  If you are not from this area, unfortunately, they will be lost on you.  If you are, it will be a rich experience.  Holly meets Richard Dreyfuss on a trip to Aruba.  Dreyfuss falls madly in love with her, and she starts to fall in love with him.  They see each other back in the States and decide to marry.  A source of tension and drama is that Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss are ""odd ducks.""  The other members of the family have always handled their rara avis daughter with love and understanding (with the possible exception of her younger sister).  But the pair of  them start to rub these traditionalists the wrong way, and to an escalating degree.

One of the most affecting moments is when Holly Hunter's family gives a memorial service for Danny Aiello's mother.  It is a large gathering of the family.  Close friends and relatives get up on stage and make heartfelt speeches.

When Danny Aiello steps on stage to sing ""Mama,"" the room goes quiet.  When he finishes, everyone is overcome.

At that moment, Richard Dreyfuss insists on taking the stage to make his own speech.  Danny Aiello's wife gasps, because she knows that somehow this would absolutely be just the wrong thing, perhaps the straw that breaks the camel's back after a series of so many resoundingly off-key gestures so many times by Dreyfuss.

But I found myself rooting for him and his bride when I thought the director and screenwriter didn't want me to.  I thought they meant Mr. and Mrs. Danny Aiello and family  to be the heroes and Holly Hunter and Richard Dreyfuss to be--not the villains, but the losers, the misfits, the inappropriate ones.

I won't tell you how the movie turns out, but it had me emoting and emoting and emoting and sometimes thinking and it had me to-ing and fro-ing, sometimes confused, and at one time sobbing deep, aching, profound sobs.

I must mention that in Dreyfuss's brilliant characterization of a Lithuanian man, he created a Lithuanian man.  I don't know if it was his idea or the director's, but two devices that were used so brilliantly were music and religion, when Dreyfuss marries Holly Hunter and when their first child is born.

The marriage ceremony takes place in a real Lithuanian church with a real Lithuanian priest singing the real Lithuanian mass, which is chanted in a deep basso voice, something like the Orthodox Russian mass.  The scene in the hospital room with Holly and the baby is totally awesome.  There is beatific Holly, holding her newborn child, and in comes Richard Dreyfuss bringing a small chorus of Lithuanian women folk singers in beautiful folk costumes replete with flowers and embroidery.  They sing several of the most beautiful a capella folk tunes. It is a magic moment.

If you like character driven movies, I can't recommend this movie highly enough.",1178928000,15,3879,4.850837138508371

427939,2,6302068983,"I too was misled by these reviews, and I too am puzzled by the apparently sincere expressions of enthusiasm for this movie.

Maybe you have to be Italian or Lithuanian, but I watch a lot of real Italian movies (the ones with subtitles), and they are not like this.

I think that Dreyfus's character was inconsistent.  He acted like a sleaze, and then he acted like a great guy, totally sincere, etc.  Then he acted like a sleaze, flattering people, snowing them with gifts, etc.  I simply think the screenwriter was trying for something he couldn't bring off.

Similarly with the movie as a whole.  This is not simply a feel-good family, although obviously the screenwriter was trying to paint such a family.  There needed to be more interaction than the stereotyped hugs and such.  Something was missing.

Also, the story went nowhere.  There was no plot, and very little story, and it lasted a long, long time.  And the movie had nothing else to offer a viewer.

I would say, be very, very careful before buying this movie.  I don't think it was overlooked.  I think it was looked at and turned down.",1165708800,3,1102,4.608247422680412

It's his best movie though sadly it was over-looked at the time of it's original release. Danny Aielo is un-believably good in this movie (whatever happened to him anyway??), and the rest of the cast is spot-on. My only criticism is that there are no extras at all.

428006,5,6302068983,"Once Around is one of those 'different' love stories.  It's about the younger woman falling in love with a man, somewhat older than she.  But the difference in their years has nothing to do with the amount of true love that he has for her.
His love for her is absolute.  His love for her is honest.  And his love for her is undying.
Unfortunately, the difference in their years, and their cultural differences (he is from Lithuania) causes a large conflict with her family.  This is what tries harder than anything to come between them.  However, their love for each other will never allow it to become an issue.  They are married, they have a child, and their love grows beyond all bounds.
The point of the love story is simple, it grows, evolves, blossoms, and possesses their lives, to the point that when her family still finds conflict with him, she simply tells them to make a choice.
They do, and all of their lives are forever changed, and the end of the movie gives a whole new meaning to the words in the title, ""Once Around.""  Enjoy this movie for what it is.  Enjoy the love, the strife, the difficulties, but most of all, enjoy it for what it brings out in all of us.  And don't be afraid to shed a tear.  For, it will truly be a tear from the heart.

 'Once Around' is a film all about ceremony--about ritual, tradition and family.

Superb, subtle cinematography and perfect casting.  Hunter and Dreyfuss  are the name stars, but Gena Rowlands is every bit as good.  And one could  say that Danny Aiello's actually makes this 'his' film.
