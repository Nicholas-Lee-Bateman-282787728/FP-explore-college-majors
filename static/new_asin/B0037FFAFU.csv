4081215,3,B0037FFAFU,"The film can be simply described as a ""guilty pleasure"". The movie is not going to win any awards and the plot is just a frame for the sex scenes to take place. Not that great but not that bad either. It wasn't bought for its strengths as a movie.",1369872000,8,247,3.96

4081217,3,B0037FFAFU,"This isn`t a sub-standard entry in the genre, not by any means, it`s just more of the same, and after viewing as many of these films as I have in my lifetime, I`m always hoping for a new twist or something more, and therein lies my lackluster afterthoughts. With these flix, plot is immaterial, only the self-delusional claim to purchase them for any other reason, these are promoted as 'Cinema Erotique' so we`re evaluating it`s exploitative value, not its cinematic one. The lead actress is fairly plain but looks great in a latex S+M outfit and naked in chains, and the only other woman in the film, a femme fatale, is sexier and has that ""love you long time"" sleaziness about her, and I mean that as praise. The story is similiar to all of the 'Zero Woman' series, nothing unfamiliar again, but on the plus side, there is ample nudity and a perversity that elevates it somewhat. If I wasn`t so friggin' jaded, I`d give it 4 stars (and it probably deserves it as exploitation) but I personally think these flix were done better in the 70`s than they are today. There was more to them then, an indefinable something that makes folks continue to remake them incessantly, but with shoddier results...",1273708800,21,1200,4.63849765258216
8390498,1,B0037FFAFU,"Run time was one hour, including credits, which means the Amazon version of the movie has been heavily edited to remove all of the sex scenes and nudity referenced in an earlier review.  (I wish they wouldn't do that.)  Other than that, it was just plain boring.",1502582400,2,262,4.553191489361702

8390501,1,B0037FFAFU,"Blink and you will miss the action, honestly I didn't really care about the characters. Just a low rade B movie, plus this is one of amzn's edited videos, it's listed on IMDB as 82 minutes, here it is 58 minutes. Where are the other 24 minutes? Although I doubt they would improve the movie at all.",1500681600,,298,4.245614035087719

8390503,1,B0037FFAFU,"There was nothing about it that I liked. I hadn't seen the first episode and now I'll be sure to avoid it. The story is weak, the policeman is supposed to be funny but isn't, the girl is unconvincing, there is a feeble attempt at sadism, the ending is bad. It's really not worth the time I've spent writing about it.",1497657600,3,316,4.19672131147541
