8693353,5,B00QYZJC8Q,"This is a real informative documentary.  It covers not only Abraham Lincoln as a person but also a great part of US History, the birth of Civil Rights.  I love it.",1527292800,,163,4.225806451612903
8693354,5,B00QYZJC8Q,"In researching my historical fiction novel based on personal history, I have watched several videos on Lincoln.  Some are flashier.  Some have famous actors in them with elaborate reenactments. Some leave you wondering why you wasted your money on the purchase.  I was afraid I was wasting my money on this one.  I was very surprised.  This video has been one of my best resources.  It is clear, easy to understand and presents the facts. This is a video you need in your video library if you are studying or interested in Abraham and/ or Mary Todd Lincoln, the civil war, or just this time period in general.  You will not be disappointed, I can assure you.",1518912000,,658,4.572649572649572

8693358,3,B00QYZJC8Q,I would have rather purchase the entire series in one listing.  Don't really like how this was parcelled out in 2 episode segments at a time.  Who wants to watch a piece of this and then have to purchase the next portion separately.  The content was very good.,1416787200,,260,4.375
