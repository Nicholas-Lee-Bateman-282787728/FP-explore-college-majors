8417422,4,B0046PVQCQ,"If you have grown kids (or any kids), think twice before you show him this or any other SCARED film. Next thing you know, they'll be wanting to do this themselves! My daughter borrowed my DVD and I can't get it back!

This DVD offers a quick look at some of the amazing places and unbelievable things the SCARED! crew have visited and done. I wouldn't recommend that anyone follow their lead for some of these things..climbing on rotting roofs, walking through tunnels filled with water and who know what else..but it is great fun to watch. This is a good starting point to get acquainted with the team, and then move on to their other excellent DVD's featuring other investigations in greater detail.",1287273600,3,701,4.653225806451613
