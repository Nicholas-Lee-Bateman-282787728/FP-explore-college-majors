8649939,5,B00JDCOVDS,Low quality video due to its archival nature. Jim Grover was practically a kid when he made this. Be that as it may...the truth never changes. Highly rec this series. I've never seen a thing that Grover signs his name to that is not top shelf.,1486252800,,243,4.304347826086956
8649940,5,B00JDCOVDS,"When I first heard of ""Jim Grover"", I thought that perhaps the alias was some cheesy marketing ploy. That notion evaporated as I watched this DVD. This was a superb training program in its day...and it still is! Some of the material is dated (getting out of cars is a lot trickier now that bench seats are gone) and Bob Kasper and Al Polkowski are sadly gone, so the Companion is a collector item these days. Nevertheless, the essential skilsl, drills and focus on mindset are just as crucial now as they were then. I now know of Jim Grover as Kelly McCann. No matter what name you know him by, you can't go wrong with this DVD. In fact anything he has produced is well worth studying. Watching and reading his materials has led me to other writers and instructors as well: Bob Kasper, Nick Hughes, and Lee Morrison come to mind. If Mr. McCann respects these fellows, you can bet they are worth studying as well.",1474243200,,912,4.434523809523809
