8415830,3,B00444STI8,"On the first review I thought I did, I rated it 5 stars.  This could be a re-evaluation.  My knees got murdered by doing this DVD.  They are still hurting to this day.  As I got further into the program, I noticed that Debbie goes completely off-beat to the music.  The guy tries to keep on beat but you can see he has to get off beat to follow her lead.  That takes away my enthusiasm.  If you have the least bit of knee pain - IMPROVISE to the hilt on this one, cause although it could be a very good program, it may cause issues with your knees.",1383955200,3,548,3.9724770642201834
