2542126,4,B000EWBKLM,"I was raised with WWII movies like Sands of Iwo Jima, and expected some version of the ""standard"" Americans vs Germans drama in this film. WRONG. This movie defines its own genre - it fits no stereotype, tho it reminds me of ""Thin Red Line"" in mood. The meta-theme I experienced in this film is the high-contrast mosaic of senselessness, brutality, destruction, unspeakable tragedies, and quenchless humanity, courage, and fierce will to survive.

The macabre mood set by the music and super-realistic high-contrast photography and random overlays of happy summer scenes against winter night-time woodlands and bloodshed is consistently eerie, jarring, and disorienting. The characters are poignant and eloquent in their facial expressions, body language, and silences. Dialog is spare and real, including the German and subtitles. The costumes are masterfully chosen and enhance the people and their situation.

I am left to wonder if this story is based on real people and events. It could be.

The impact of this movie depends partly on its unpredictability, so I will not comment on (give away) the plot or players. If you seek a ""conventional"" stars-and-stripes war-movie drama and ending, choose another title. If you seek a movie that will absorb you and leave you subdued and pondering, choose this one.

Wow.",1181606400,,1317,5.2274881516587675
2542127,3,B000EWBKLM,"I am neither impressed or unimpressed with this movie.  The first quality that bothered me were the flashbacks to some woman, apparently at home.  There are flashbacks to war scenes that one can understand to be affecting the soldier's current behavior, but the flashbacks to the woman are never explained and don't seem to be relevant to the story.  The whole situation at first seems to be rather improbable - two lost American soldiers, deserters, wandering all over the countryside during wartime without encountering any Germans except one patrol trying to get captured by the Americans so they can have some food to eat!

The story turns more interesting when the soldiers encounter some handicapped children and their caregivers.  In this group they find purpose in their situation when a German patrol comes upon them.  The children must be genuine Romanian orphans or castaways - one boy really has no legs.  Another girl is apparently badly burned so she wears a mask.  In the battle, the more bitter of the two soldiers seems to find his purpose in life at great sacrifice.  However, I found it to be less than satisfying when the second soldier leads the remnants of the children's group to the woods and the movie ends there with his apparent death.  What happened to the children?  I think it would be much more satisfying if he'd recovered and decided to give his life to caring for many war-injured orphans.

This is an interesting movie, worth watching.  It, many times, reminded me of the Kurdish/Iranian movie, 'Turtles Can Fly.'  Between the two movies, I prefer 'Turtle' because it is much more realistic and has a very startling climax.  I guarantee that you will forget you are reading subtitles with Turtle.",1174608000,,1731,4.88013698630137
2542128,1,B000EWBKLM,"If you REALLY have to see this movie, borrow it from some poor fool who bought one... It's not worth the price of a rental...

I don't know what movie other folks saw... It was disjointed, molassas slow throughout the first hour and just all around ""sad"" (for want of a better discription)... Bad props and uniforms/costumes, it was just ALL WRONG any way you look at it and the story was in NO way able to salvage it being just as bad...

SERIOUSLY DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE!!!",1153526400,7,490,4.315217391304348
2542129,2,B000EWBKLM,"In light of all the books I've read and movies I've seen on the many heroes and common foot soldiers (also heroes in my eyes) of WWII, seeing the movie start out with a couple of American deserters, (one of them 82 Airborne!) immediately put me into a bad state of mind.  The movie definitely has a European directed feel to it with a lot of heady, trippy flashback stuff going on to try and show us what was zipping through the depressed mind of the Airborne guy and his American GI ""captor.""  There's also the interaction with civilian children and two adults banded together against the Germans.  It all comes down to a weak last stand against the Germans only really seeking a loot of fine art in the basement of the building the Americans and civilians are all holed up in.

Some people may like the feel of the movie (those who know very little of what happened in the ETO) but I personally wouldn't watch the movie again.

Dark and uninspiring and bit strange.",1152489600,5,967,4.440677966101695
2542130,4,B000EWBKLM,"I had the pleasure of meeting producer Chuck Williams the other day and he was very proud of this little film. I understand why. The movie is set in 1945 at the tail end of the war in Europe. The Americans and their allies have basically won, but not all the troops in the field know this yet. Two American deserters come across a group of freedom fighters that consist of two adults and several children. They are living in an abandoned building in the hills and survive by raiding Germans and stealing supplies. Eventually, a group of Germans surrounds the building and the group must repel wave after wave of Nazi soldiers. I will not give out spoilers, but there is a reason the Germans want to take this building. There is a real beauty to this film. The way it is shot and the music reminds me of early Werner Herzog work. For World War 2 fans, there is plenty of action as well as the Germans and children battle it out for the last 30 minutes of the movie. There is also a beauty to these children (many have some sort of war injury or birth defect) who begin to trust the American soldiers with their lives. This is a great surprise and blows away 90% of the sewage Hollywood churned out last year. Buy it.",1151193600,15,1215,4.310043668122271
2542131,5,B000EWBKLM,"I have collected War movies since I was a teen. Now in my 40's  I have now seen or own more war movies than most can imagine even exist. I thought Id seen every variation on a war movie you could do. Walking through Walmart a few weeks ago I stumbled across this and even though I had never heard of it decided to give it a try. I was impressed, to the point where I can't get it out of my head. What a jem! Maybe it does borrow a little from the Gary Sinise character in a ""Midnight Clear"" & certainly offers a little nod to ""Castle Keep"" but beyond that it is a truly  original and surreal story that may not fully fall into place for you until the very end. It is an independent film with a bigger movie feel. (After ""Saint & Soldiers"" & this I think I could be hooked on Indie war movies).

Set in the winter of '45 the film adresses the horror of war from perspectives that you won't expect and leaves you questioning the motivations of those that choose to fight. An interesting twist is that it's Director is more known for Horror films. This may well be what drives its originality. I won't go into plot development because I believe the less you know about the story the more impact it will have on you. It is not an expensive film to buy, which just seems to add value to a quality film. It's not your run of the mill war movie; that may be more than some people can take. but it's so worth it in the end. Rent it or buy it, but don't pass this one by.",1150934400,38,1462,4.017182130584192
2542132,5,B000EWBKLM,"This movie surprised me. I was expecting it to be dark (the title says it all), but there's a lot of light here as well. You'll find it in the spirit of the children who join forces with two American soldiers to defend their ""castle"" from the Germans. Scott MacDonald  carries the action brilliantly with his wild-eyed Deming. You never quite know if or when he'll cross the line completely and lose it. And yet his humanity comes to the fore when it's crunchtime. Ryan Francis as his conflicted cohort provides the perfect counterpoint for the insanity that slowly surrounds these two. Director Jeff Burr adds a gritty layer to the scenes and settings in Romania where the movie was filmed. This one sticks with you for a while.",1150934400,6,729,4.651162790697675
2542133,4,B000EWBKLM,"This is simply a great flick that tells a compelling story from a strong viewpoint. The acting is where it needs to be and the kids steal the show. If you like a story that makes you pay attention, then this film is for you. If you're not hooked after the opening, then you must not like good war movies. Jeff, this is one you should be proud of. It makes a statement...and a powerful one at that.",1150243200,4,397,4.102564102564102
2542134,4,B000EWBKLM,"I watched this film really not knowing what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. The opening scene was powerful, several GI's in a jeep heading away from the front lines, they drive over a landmine. The Director--Jeff Burr really knows where to place the camera--he gets great coverage and you really see a lot of the work that goes into every shot, it is visually very stunning. The actors and situations were very well done. The characters were very disturbing and the film bordered between horror and suspense and the end packed quite a punch, with a lot of shooting and explosions. The most controversial elements of the film involved Roumanian children in the movie--but if you watch the documentary on the making of the film--it will open eyes to how this picture was made, and the documentary is very honest and tells you things that you would never have known.

I was changed after watching this film! Highly recommend if you like a little war, sprinkled with horror and suspense.",1150070400,6,993,4.773255813953488
2542135,5,B000EWBKLM,"Director Jeff Burr may have defined a career trajectory point with his superb work on ""Straight Into Darkness.""  Like Oliver Stone's ""PLATOON"" or Terrence Malick's ""THIN RED LINE"", Burr does not shy away from the graphic realities of war, nor does he skate over philosophical and character themes.  As eloquently described in a current FILM THREAT feature story and review, Burr gets the most out of his cast, crew and concept and delivers that long sought after (but seldomly found) independent film treasure.  Bravo!",1148774400,21,518,5.142857142857143
2542136,2,B000EWBKLM,Having watched The Outpost with Ray Stephenson I figured this movie would be on the same order. I was in error. One character is so bad that he tries to commit rape. The other tries to stop it and is beaten into unconsciousness. David Warner is probably the only saving grace of this film. The airborne soldier who deserts is shown as sympathetic. He accidentally kills a woman and child during combat. the rest of the story makes no sense. IMHO the movie is made to depict American soldiers as less than honorable.,1270598400,,515,4.548387096774194
2542137,5,B000EWBKLM,"I caught a little of this movie late at night on public television a couple years ago, and was captivated by what I saw.  I finally got the movie recently, and really enjoyed it for its unique story and directing.",1261785600,,213,4.325
2542138,4,B000EWBKLM,"I bought this movie on a whim and when I started to watch it, I was somewhat distracted by its low budget nature, and for a certain sloppiness.  Set in ""Winter 1945,"" the movie has as one of its main characters a soldier from the 82nd Airborne Division, yet much of the terrain in the movie looked nothing like the terrain where the unit was at the time (how did all those mountains get to Belgium and northern Germany, for example).

However, the movie gradually drew me in and I began to forgive it its shortcomings as I realized it was actually a pretty intelligent movie.  Moreover, it has a surprise or two in it for the viewer.  The two main leads (the American soldiers) give good performances, and the children transcend their initial Tod Browningness.  The ending is satisfying and after it was over I discovered I was quite glad I had tried it.

It is a movie that is very hard to pigeonhole or to neatly describe.  It would have benefited from less genericness (in a number of regards), but it actually is a film that its director can be proud of.  Try it; you might be as pleasantly surprised as I was.",1258156800,2,1114,4.4
2542139,5,B000EWBKLM,"This movie was amazing. After seeing just about every War movie in the bush this is the first one to stand out in it's own light.  The movie starts off with 2 soldiers traveling through a Wartorn country. The only real look you have into the personal lives of these soldiers are flash backs from time to time. Matter of fact the brief history of the characters is told throughout the movie in brief cenimatic flashbacks. It's never overbearing as it's only 3-4 secs long, but you have to put the pieces together. One soldiers mind switches between the love of his life he lost back home, and a tragic accident that happened to him in war. The other soldier is battle fatigued he's just plain and tired of playing soldier.  These two roam about trying to figure out where they are untill one day they come across a building that is serving as a shelter for a unique gorup of children. These run away soldiers finally realize they have something to worry about that's more important than them. This movie is pretty interesting mostly the style that it's filmed in. Although I admit leather faces daughter was very creepy at times, but it's what made the movie so perfect. I enjoyed the movie alot, the ending no so much as it was left kind of open, and you wondering what happend next(I hate those endings)but, the ending was more on a philosophical level with the idea of Leather faces daughter and her mask having some deeper meaning. If your into horror movies this is great, and if you love war movies this should be on your must view list.",1247961600,,1542,4.503571428571429
2542140,5,B000EWBKLM,"While i would normally rate this 3 1/2 to 4 I'm giving it a 5 just because I see the potential of Jeff Burr to do a REALLY awesome film. This one was way better than I was expecting as well as somewhat unique in it's storyline. Loved the kids and the haunting photography.  So yeah...great film....do some more!
edit...changed my mind...5 star film!",1230422400,,349,4.453125
2542141,1,B000EWBKLM,"this film was bad on many levels. this is a low budget film. Most of this film is filled with bright shining flashbacks to the soldiers girlfriends. they do it so much its annoying. the acting was very poor, the script may have been written by a ten year old. the super soldiers in this film are children. the super soldiers are not effective soldiers and die easily. The Nazis in this film wear green overcoats and in the next scene wear brown coats. The weapons in this film are obvious fakes. the colt 1911 in most of this film looks like a bb gun. the luger has no moving toggle and clicks many times when empty. The tank in this film, supposed to be a Tiger is an obvious fake. Somehow the tank commander is in command of all the Nazis in this film. The editor of this film seems to be a novice. the opening scene a jeep explodes and it takes far too long.",1220918400,4,861,4.161676646706587
2542142,1,B000EWBKLM,This is not a review...I am just trying to tell you that this DVD does NOT have English subtitles as advertised by you!!  I am stuck with this DVD as it would cost almost as much returning as buying another!!,1206576000,3,208,4.2
2542143,5,B000EWBKLM,"I recommend this movie for those who want to think more deeply about a war movie. It is foreboding and eerie with several messages and the flashbacks should bother you, they set the mood and some of the meaning of this film. There are weird things going on in this movie as well as with its characters. There are things and personalities that symbolize aspects of war and those who tread the edge of its insanity. There are clues that can give insight or require more thought. I have loaned this movie to several friends who also enjoyed it and we have shared our own interpretations along with some interesting discussions about it.",1196726400,,633,4.610619469026549
2542144,2,B000EWBKLM,"I borrowed the DVD based on the reviews here. I think it's overrated. It had promise at the beginning but begins to fizzle out in the middle. The main character had flashbacks which is not explained why. Disabled children resistance fighters? C'mon. Let's get real. When did that happen? Evidently this is fiction. Even then I thought this would be a film similar to WWII horror comics, e.g. ""Spear of Destiny, etc."" because of the skeleton-faced Germans on the cover. If you really want to see a good WWII indie film you'd be better of with ""When Trumpets Fade"" and ""Saints and Soldiers."" ""Combat!"" television series in the 60's was way better. This was a waste of my time and money.",1183939200,3,684,4.661157024793388

8114891,4,B000EWBKLM,"Surprisingly strong and intelligent WWII film, especially given its terribly misleading packaging, which makes it look like a cheapie war/horror film.  But instead, this is a stylish (especially given its tiny budget), generally well acted and original view of the horrors and absurdities of war.

While not every element worked for me (the super brief, almost hallucinatory flashbacks of home started to grate after a while), theres so much thats original here -- from the fact the two main characters are deserters, not 'heroes', to the army of child soldiers they team up with (and prompt questions as to whether these handicapped kids are heroes or victims of exploitation or both), this film dares to ask important questions and is told with unique perspectives.  Well worth seeing for its originality and style on a shoestring.",1462665600,,833,5.155555555555556

8114893,3,B000EWBKLM,"Part of me wanted to rate this film lower but it has a great premise, some solid acting and a few scenes worth the cost of admission alone. I don't think it holds together overall but it still haunts me and it is truly ""different"".  While not gory it pushes the ""squirm"" button and seldom lets up. If violence against women and children (and violence by women and children) rubs you wrong pass this up. If you can handle that and are bored with formulaic horror, art or war films this may fit your need.",1438560000,,503,4.294736842105263
8114894,4,B000EWBKLM,"Directed by Jeff Burr and produced by Chuck Williams, this war movie is unlike many of the genre. Filmed in Romania, the movie takes place in World War II Europe as two deserters stumble upon an orphanage and are faced with forming an alliance with the orphans' keepers to defend against a Nazi ambush. Burr's horror past comes into play in this dark film, starring Daniel Roebuck in a short role. The DVD features a documentary with Burr and his cast and producers. This movie is a hidden gem and well worth the money. Beware when buying a copy that the Blu Ray version is not a format that will play on US players. Go for the standard DVD.",1432425600,,641,4.394957983193278
8114895,2,B000EWBKLM,"This is a different type of war story which doesn't make it better. Two American deserters (nervous in the service) make their way across rural France? when they encounter civilians who capture them. When The Germans show up things change.

The film uses a lot of flashbacks which proved to be more useless than useful. One girl wore a leatherface, something director Jeff Burr must of had left over from another film, and like Ed Wood, hates to see a good prop go to waste no matter how inanely it ties into the tale. Scott MacDonald played an unlikeable character very well. Ryan Francis, our protagonist needed more substance to his role. His flashbacks didn't make it.

The children aspect made the film interesting and slightly entertaining, but not something I would watch twice.

8114899,4,B000EWBKLM,"Straight Into Darkness is one of the more fascinating war movies because the storyline is different from the norm.  It's about two American soldiers that end up walking through the cold forests and hills of snowy Germany alone during World War II after an explosion kills the rest of the group.  One of the soldiers has a loose trigger and basically forces the other one to tag along and do whatever he says, whenever he wants.  They eventually find a building where children are staying.

Now the unique thing here is, these children aren't defenseless- they are specially trained to fight in a war.  It was never really said if they were trained by the older man and woman who also live in the building- all we see are the children acting oddly quiet for an extended period of time not because they're weird, but because they're preparing for a potential German invasion (which does happen, soon in fact).  Apparently the old man and woman are actually French even though they look and sound distinctly British.

Having a storyline focus around the children during World War II is a fascinating and welcoming alternative- we're so used to seeing American men battling either the Germans or Japanese that having a storyline focus on the children is a nice change.  I can't really find any sources that say whether this story is fictional but... I think it absolutely has to be.  I'd like to think that, even though I wasn't always the most alert student in history class, that several children being trained to take out a German army would have been mentioned in several history book chapters over the years.  I would have remembered it.

The presentation of the movie is really beautiful.  Well I mean, beautiful in a really grim and dreary kind of way, capturing the accuracy of a snowy German forest during such a devastating war.  It's amazingly effective in appearance, and reminds me of Saving Private Ryan (hey whether you like that Tom Hanks movie or not, you gotta admit it *looks* amazing).  My only complaint is that the action is too camera jerky.  By that I mean, you see a shooting/death for a split second, then it immediately switches to another shooting so you can't really absorb the powerful impact of the first death.  A war-hectic segment near the end is a perfect example.  It all becomes a blur.

Still, Straight Into Darkness succeeds in telling World War II from a different angle, whether fictional or otherwise.  Highly recommended.",1367193600,,2460,4.773049645390071
