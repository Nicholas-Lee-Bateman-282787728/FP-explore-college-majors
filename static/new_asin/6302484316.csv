8423231,2,6302484316,"I have to disagree with the comments made by the other reviewers. I first saw Wet and Wild 4 on the Playboy Channel in 1992.  I taped the program to watch it again and I was sorely disappointed.  Playboy essentially holds firm to their rigid format, with those awful ""vignettes"" (as they call them) with horrid rapid fire editing, quick cuts, and dark, unfocused backgrounds.  MTV style videos that totally waste beautiful Playboy Playmates.  The first segment on the luxury ship is the only halfway satisfying one, but the nude shots of Cady Cantrell and Christy Thom are far too brief to enjoy; the quick cuts nearly ruin it.  The other segments, (see previous reviewer for a detailed description), are all lukewarm and mostly fall flat.  Tanya Beyer and Julie Clarke (who both looked fabulous in the magazine), barely register here, and that is unfortunate, since they're both drop-dead gorgeous babes.  Wendy Hamilton, (another one of my favorites), saves this video from being a total washout with her ""White Room"" scene.
Don't waste your money on this.  In fact, just avoid Playboy Video entirely.  You'll save yourelf a lot of grief.",1005782400,2,1140,4.9267015706806285
