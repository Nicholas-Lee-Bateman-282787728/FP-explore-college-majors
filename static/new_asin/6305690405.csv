Unfortunately, this one was so easy, so boring, that I did it once and got rid of it.",1176163200,,260,4.078431372549019
7892941,5,6305690405,"The best thing about this workout video is the soundtrack. I've had some aerobics videos where the music was uninspiring, or worse, downright annoying, but that's not the case for this one; this soundtrack makes you want to keep moving.  The other great thing about this video is Ruth's personality.  She looks like she's having so much fun, it's almost impossibe not to have fun yourself.  A highlight of this video is when Ruth walks over and grabs her fiddle--right in the middle of the routine--and then rejoins the other dancers in front of the camera.  She continues to do all the footwork (it's actually a country line dance at this point in the video) while she plays this awesome fiddle break.  It's amazing.  I wish there were more workout videos like this one.",1167523200,,771,4.7164179104477615
