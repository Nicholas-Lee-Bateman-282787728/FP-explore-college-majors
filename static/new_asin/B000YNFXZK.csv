3033482,3,B000YNFXZK,"Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who actually liked the original White Noise. While far from a great movie I thought it was enjoyable even if forgettable. Going into White Noise 2 my expectations were quite low. Even though I did enjoy the original I didn't really have high hopes, but like the original being a decent surprise so was the sequel. By no means is this a great movie and like the previous at the end of the day it is forgettable, but overall I thought White Noise was a decent surprise. White Noise 2 is a stand-alone sequel; there is no connection between the 2 movies, this is just a sequel by name only.

White Noise 2 does continue the EVP concept, but now adds near death experience to the mix. I thought White Noise 2 had a pretty decent idea and some elements work and others seem to lack. Writer Matt Venne actually writes a pretty decent script. I sort of see this movie as a White Noise meets The Dead Zone. Instead of a man with psychic visions the lead character sees a white light and that's how he knows who is in danger. Matt Venne doesn't really bring us anything exactly new to this genre, but he does write a script that does have some creative moments. This movie is a little smarter than most people would think. White Noise 2 is very much a character driven movie rather than action and Venne does a good job.

Director Patrick Lussier does a good job at brining everything to life. There are moments where the pacing might be a little on the slow side, but he always manages to keep things from getting too slow. Though there are moments where the pacing was a little too slow. There is little to no scares. If you've seen enough horror movies the scares are quite predictable, but there is some decent tension. For the most part Lussier does keep the movie interesting; this isn't an Iconic directing job, but good enough to make an interesting movie.

Like I said White Noise 2 is very character driven and Nathan Fillion is excellent in the lead role as Abe Dale. The makers got very lucky in landing Fillion who is a very talented actor. He really makes this movie a lot better than maybe it should have been. He's in pretty much every scene and he does a great job at carrying the movie. Katee Sackhoff as Sherry Clarke also delivers an excellent performance. She's a very talented actress and manages to light up the screen in every scene she appears in. Her character is a lot of fun and Katee really seems to be enjoying herself and any character who lists Bride of Frankenstein as their favorite movie is my kinda girl.

When all is said and done White Noise 2 isn't a great movie by any means, but does serve as a decent time killer. Odds are if you liked the original you'll probably like this, even if you didn't like the original you might like this since it's not a continuation. White Noise 2 had the potential to be a lot more than it was, but at the end of the day it might be sort of forgettable, but White Noise 2 is actually a fairly good movie.",1200268800,8,3010,4.341030195381883
3033483,4,B000YNFXZK,"I loved the first White Noise movie.  The whole concept of EVP just fascinates me.  When I heard that there was going to be a White Noise 2, I just had to have it.

This movie certainly does not pickup where the original left off.  It is a clean slate from the beginning.  There is no slow, boring lead in.  The whole story line was laid out in a clever and relatively quick fashion.  It is a little confusing at first but this adds to the suspense.  The special effects are good, at times, but nothing overly exciting.  The jump factor of this film was a bit weak.  Sure, there are some scenes that have the typical sudden flashes that make you jump a bit, but with a movie like this you would expect a bit more.  My wife hates horror films that make you jump, so she was quite happy with the overall mild fear factor of this film.  =o)

Overall I was quite pleased with this film and glad that I purchased the DVD for my collection.  It is nearly as good as the original White Noise, but just lacks a little punch.  The ending was somewhat confusing and leaves a bit to each viewers imagination.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  The story keeps your attention, the directing seems good, the choice of actors and their associated performances are very good.  As a comparison I think I would rate the first White Noise a 5, while I consider White Noise 2 a 4 and 1/2.  It is a great film that I recommend to everyone.  I guess I just didn't get the same thrill from this film as I did the original.  Maybe the whole ""Near Death Experience"" concept just isn't quite as mysterious to me as it might be for others.  I suggest you see the movie and judge for yourself.  If you enjoyed the first White Noise movie, I'm sure you will not be dissapointed with this one.",1200096000,7,1768,4.227544910179641
3033484,5,B000YNFXZK,"I never saw the first movie, and it's not really a sequel so there is no need. This is a stand alone movie all in its own right. The story is tight. The action is great. The pacing is excellent.

Nathan Fillion should be a big star. I really don't know why he isn't. I'm a big NF fan, but he is the the main reason I love this movie. It's going to be on my list of to be watched again and again movies.",1199923200,2,402,3.7294117647058824
3033485,5,B000YNFXZK,"There has been a great deal of negative press surrounding ""White Noise 2"", a lot of it unjustly based on opinions of its predecessor ""White Noise"".

""White Noise 2"" (Also known as ""White Noise The Light"") however, stands alone with little connection to the first movie ""White Noise"".

Nathan Fillion leads the cast as Abe Dale and accomplishes something rarely seen in a move of this genre, a connection with the characters.  You're instantly drawn into Abe's world, and when he suffers a tragic and seemingly pointless loss, you can't help but feel for him.  We see a more vulnerable character from Nathan Fillion than we have seen before and he expresses Abe's loss in such a way that is truly believable.

Katee Sackhoff, as Sherry, brings a degree of warmth and joy to what could otherwise be a somewhat dark experience and the dynamic between Nathan and Katee works exceptionally well.

Anyone who is a fan of either Nathan Fillion or Katee Sackhoff is sure to be as impressed with this film as I have been.

Props to Patrick Lussier who brings out the best in a sequel to a movie that was considered by many to be a disappointing experience.",1199404800,28,1147,4.648514851485149
3033486,5,B000YNFXZK,"I don't usually write reviews, but I couldn't let this movie stand with only one review saying it was horrible.
I enjoyed the first movie, but I can completely understand why some people didn't. A lot of the fear that the audience was supposed to feel is only accessible to those who had ever dealt with EVP.
But, I digress.
White Noise 2, was wonderful. The trailer had me hooked and the movie did not disappoint.
I will admit that the fact Nathan Fillion was in the movie was a major boon, and as can be expected, he did a wonderful job. He is fun to watch and easy to sympathize with.

I thought that the story and plot was pretty good and the actors were also good. I never heard of Nathan fillion before this movie. he did an good job and I would like to see him do more movies. and the girl who played sherry was also good. this movie goes to show that you can't cheat death or if you do or help someone that does if you got stuck with michales(Fillion) powers of being able to know when people are about to die there will be consenquents. so don't play around with the order of things. this movie did kind of stry off from the first but still kept up with it. all in all I thought that it was pretty good. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1377561600,2,904,4.027777777777778

Nathan Fillion makes a totally sympathetic character.  You like him and so it's easy to go along on the journey when no one else but the viewer gets exactly what he's going through or buys his story.  I like paradoxical endings and this movie, like the first, has one.  The theme of this series seems to be that messing with the other side before your time never ends well and it makes an entertaining enough story for me.

3033549,3,B000YNFXZK,"**Dear John,

There are spoilers.

XOXO Jane**

I was very confused when I watched this movie because I thought it was going to be a sequel to White Noise.  The two are so very different that I can't really consider this to be a follow-up and so I am going to treat it like a related but very separate movie for the purpose of reviewing.

On one hand I really liked this movie; I thought it was an interesting paranormal / Biblical slant to take for a film.  On the other hand I also found this movie really amusing by the end.  I wasn't entirely expecting the direction that the film went in which is what made me settle on a three instead of a two for the rating.  On a technical note:

The movie has some very decent and very bad acting all mixed together; this makes it hard to stomach at certain points.  There are moments where the suspense is taken away by the hilarity of facial expressions, it almost bordered on B-Movie quality at a few points.  Then the next moment we're faced with some really well done dramatic scenes that draw you back in.  It left me feeling pulled away from the movie instead of immersed in it.

You can at certain points in the movie (eg: ambulance scene at the end) actually see the camera which should have been caught in editing.

The premise of becoming an ""un-tuned receiver"" able to pick up on white noise and the paranormal activity that resides within it was really interesting, along with the interpretations of what the white light (aura, halo, what have you) around individuals signified.  I wish that had been fleshed out more deeply, instead by the time we reached that point of the film it's a rush to the ending.  I almost wished that White Noise 2 had been about Henry Caine (played by Craig Fairbrass) instead of Abe Dale (aka: Captain Hammer - Nathan Fillion), he seemed like a far more interesting character and I wanted to know more about him.

We don't really end up knowing a lot about any of the characters in the film, even Abe seemed very distant.  We aren't sure exactly what he does, or his friend, or how he feels about much of anything.  He's there, he's playing God, and he'd getting his just desserts for it while being terrified of ghosts simultaneously haunting and leading him to those about to die.  I didn't feel any real attachment to him or the other characters, they just were and that was it.

Really the movie fell apart at the end for me; it just drifted off into the land of Happy Endings near the Eep! What Happened? ocean.  It isn't horrible though, and it is decent enough to watch once.  I would never see it again or suggest it to a friend, but it isn't a complete waste of time to see and you may end up liking it for all the little flaws.  I don't know why this is a sequel though, the only thing they have in common is (loosely) the phenomena of White Noise and people dying.",1307059200,,2861,4.344632768361582
3033550,3,B000YNFXZK,"This movie was really creepy for the first 30-40 minutes, then it just fizzled out. Still, if you want a good scare...",1296345600,,118,4.409090909090909
3033551,4,B000YNFXZK,"Check it out, really this movie should have been called something else rather than White Noise 2, and should not have been a direct to Dvd relase. With a little more money pumped into it and the right promotion, this would have been the sleeper hit of 2009 in the theaters.",1293148800,,273,4.372549019607843
3033552,4,B000YNFXZK,"White Noise 2 features a storyline basically consisting of a male actor who happens to look remarkably similar to Jason Bateman walking around a city and seeing brightly colored flashing images surrounding ANY person about ready to die in a tragic sudden way, whether it be children, women or men.  So what does this mean?

It means, for most of the film, the main character tries his very best to save all the people about to unexpectedly kick the bucket.  Does he succeed?  I wanna yell with a resounding ""YES!"" but eh... not necessarily.  Sometimes he saves lives, other times he fails.  There's some good action and suspense in wondering who will survive and who won't, however.  Do NOT expect to really get to know most of the people he saves- keep this in mind.  Many times these people appear once, and that's it- you never see them again.

Immediately you will probably notice that the film writers took a pretty cool concept from the original and beat it into the ground with White Noise 2.  The suspense does not really come from the unusual spiritual messages being seen and heard from the other side- more like the suspense comes from a man running around town saving as many lives as possible.

Whenever you see a flashing image of a deadly spirit being shown on a TV screen or any kind of electronic, it just doesn't have the same kind of heart-pumping impact that it did in the original White Noise.  For that, the film is a minor disappointment because there's no real atmosphere or for that matter, no real direction either.  The segments where the main character tries to understand what's going on by doing extensive research and solving math problems aren't exactly memorable either.

I can't really say you should skip White Noise 2 because if you like gimmicky horror that feels relatively low budget, the movie works great.  However it's not the real deal like the first one.  Nothing particularly creepy here.",1293148800,2,1933,4.7253731343283585

3033558,4,B000YNFXZK,Another dip into the Supernatural pool of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). This time there is softer plot line with less gross-out shocks and no evil demons but still has a understandable air of truth about the effects of near-death experiences. Nathan Fillion (of Serenity fame) plays the central character convincingly as a man with a burden of knowledge that can save people but for how long before the natural order of things defeats his successful efforts. The growing love of a nurse he has saved puts him in a terrible dilemma. As the realization of his commitment to set things right leads to a very sad and moving ending.

3033563,4,B000YNFXZK,"Abe Dale (Nathan Fillion) watches as a total stranger walks up and shoots his son, his wife and then himself. Shocked, he mourns the loss of his family uncontrollably until he can take it no more and attempts suicide. But as he makes his way into that ever spoken of white light, doctors resuscitate him and he returns to the land of the living.

Thus begins a tale that seems to be headed one direction before it takes a disastrous turn. Now returned to life, Nathan begins to see auras around various people he encounters, including a doctor attempting to help him. The doctor describes the things Nathan sees and hears as a form of EVP or electronic voice phenomena (a phenomena paranormal researchers actually use).

But things go bad as the people he sees begin to die. Nathan realizes that he has the ability to save their lives and begins doing so, including a young nurse who consoled him in the hospital.

That nasty twist? It seems that once you save someone's life you become responsible for all actions taken thereafter. And since they were taken away from their time to die, they turn around and kill others. As Nathan digs deeper into the man who killed his family's past, he discovers him alive. He also finds out that the man was doing so only because he had saved them earlier. And they would have become killers just like the others he had saved.

Faced with this knowledge, Nathan must now go out and find those that he helped and stop them from killing. Caught in the conundrum of realizing he must take life when his whole goal was to save them, the moral questions Nathan deals with make this movie a complex thriller that keeps you in suspense.

Fillion turns in a wonderful performance, as he always does. The goal of an actor is to not seem to be acting and in all I've had the fortune of seeing him do, I've felt that in each role even when he faces the afterlife or squishy monsters (as in SLITHER). The rest of the cast performs just as well in a story that seems incredible but at the same time somehow believable.

Your views on the afterlife may not change after watching this film. But for the time you spend watching it, you will wonder what you would do in the same situation. And you will wait to find out just what happens to Nathan Dale and those whose lives he touched.",1202774400,4,2307,4.442080378250591
3033564,1,B000YNFXZK,"If you're reading this, I'm assuming you've seen the film. Due to this assumption, spoilers follow, so consider yourself warned.

If you haven't seen the film ... consider yourself lucky.

White Noise 2 has been called ""a retarded Sixth Sense"", a charge that offends both the mentally disabled and anyone who even moderately enjoyed the Sixth Sense.

While my expectations for any direct-to-DVD movie are understandably low, watching White Noise 2 actually lowered my standards to heretofore unknown depths.

From the Scooby Doo scares to the incredibly poor CGI effects, this movie claims its rightful place in bargain bins around the world and as a featured selection during Amazon's frequent $5 DVD sales.

Occasionally, bad films can also be fun films. That is not the case here. This film is so earnest in its attempt to be morose that it even renders poor Captain Reynolds unfunny, something I thought impossible. There are few things more off-putting than ludicrous trash that tries to play it straight.

After the movie was over, I played a game with myself called, ""Which is More Ridiculous?"", in which I evaluated certain aspects of the film in order to come to a conclusion about which, among  the many absurd elements contained in the film, was actually the most asinine:

Is it the doctor with the goatee and the earring who likes Elvis (he's got Elvis memorabilia everywhere! It's a character trait, see?) and runs a grant-sponsored ""ghost monitoring"" program, complete with requisite multi-monitor uber-hacker station recently borrowed from Kevin Smith's character from Live Free or Die Hard?

Is it that said uber-hacker station resides in the laundry room of your average suburban hospital?

Could it be that a man who attempts suicide can just walk out of a hospital, no questions asked? Or that said hospital has possibly the worst security of all time? A woman is brutally attacked and nearly abducted in the parking garage, and no one is the wiser. Nathan Fillion acts like a suspicious lunatic in the hallway, nobody says, ""boo"".

Could it be Nathan Fillion's silly urban hoodie / suit combo that he wears for more than half of the movie?

Maybe it's that the entire plot hinges around one character's bible-slash-journal which actually contains entries like a picture of the devil with the caption, ""Lucifer?"" Or maybe that said character (a convicted murderer) has been in an asylum for three months, and yet his home computer is still on and the screen immediately shows the last thing he was looking at? Or that his son is playing Sly Cooper, a PS2-era game on a 52 inch screen? Doesn't that kid know any better?! Hello, jaggies!

Or perhaps how the director loved certain shots so much that he shows them multiple times from different camera angles, to show us how totally rad they are? How many times do we have to see a piano fall on top of people? The answer, sir or madam, is three times. How many times must we see a bicycle-riding ghost go right through a car? Twice, because it's that cool.

Given all of this, it's clear that this movie should have been called White Noise 2: The Lamening (pronounced lay-men-ning), due to the huge helpings of lame it serves up at every turn. The plot is horrid. The pacing is turgid. The dialogue is insipid. The score is haphazard and an annoyance at best. The makeup effects were leftovers from The Frighteners (a better movie).

I submit to you that White Noise 2: Electric Boogaloo would have also been an appropriate name, as it would have tied into the whole EVP nonsense, and also indicated what a monstrous stinker this film is. The tagline should have been: You Won't See It Coming, Because You Won't Care.

There is, however, one redeeming quality to this movie. During one of the scenes, there is a promotional poster for John Carpenter's The Thing on the wall. Thinking of classic moments from that better, smarter film is what got me through this one.

To the folks posting 4 star reviews on here and dismissing the lameness as a by-product of the horror genre, allow me to point you towards the above movie as an example of how things are done right.",1202256000,5,4134,4.783707865168539

I was kind of expecting it to suck as bad as the first one, but I was very surprised, this one is actually pretty good. Nathan Fillion's character has a near-death experience and from then on he has the power to ""see"" people who are going to die within the next few minutes. This movie definately has more scary parts than the first one, which I thought wasn't at all scary. It's not an excellent movie, but it is pretty good.",1201564800,4,609,4.213675213675214

3033567,4,B000YNFXZK,"Considering the flood of direct-to-DVD horror movie sequels, this one floats to the top.  The original theatrical film with Michael Keaton left something to be desired, however, this new flick gives the titular paranormal theme a boost.  You just have to keep your EVP's and NDE's in order as you make sense of the plot and all the religious subtext.  My guess-- this could have been an unrelated stand-alone screenplay that was adapted to fit the ""White Noise"" genre.  Katee Sackhoff does a great turn as the love interest, and fans will remember her from her initial foray into horror from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Resurrection/dp/B00006LPHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween - Resurrection</a>.  In all, this could spawn a third sequel if the present filmmakers sign on for another go round.  Since it seems horror fans will devour anything that has competent and creative effort behind it (even if it doesn't hit the theaters), we may be seeing more films like this hit the shelves and not the cineplexes.",1200355200,10,1072,5.58641975308642
3267979,3,B000YNFXZK,"Sometimes I feel like I'm the only person who actually liked the original White Noise. While far from a great movie I thought it was enjoyable even if forgettable. Going into White Noise 2 my expectations were quite low. Even though I did enjoy the original I didn't really have high hopes, but like the original being a decent surprise so was the sequel. By no means is this a great movie and like the previous at the end of the day it is forgettable, but overall I thought White Noise was a decent surprise. White Noise 2 is a stand-alone sequel; there is no connection between the 2 movies, this is just a sequel by name only.

White Noise 2 does continue the EVP concept, but now adds near death experience to the mix. I thought White Noise 2 had a pretty decent idea and some elements work and others seem to lack. Writer Matt Venne actually writes a pretty decent script. I sort of see this movie as a White Noise meets The Dead Zone. Instead of a man with psychic visions the lead character sees a white light and that's how he knows who is in danger. Matt Venne doesn't really bring us anything exactly new to this genre, but he does write a script that does have some creative moments. This movie is a little smarter than most people would think. White Noise 2 is very much a character driven movie rather than action and Venne does a good job.

Director Patrick Lussier does a good job at brining everything to life. There are moments where the pacing might be a little on the slow side, but he always manages to keep things from getting too slow. Though there are moments where the pacing was a little too slow. There is little to no scares. If you've seen enough horror movies the scares are quite predictable, but there is some decent tension. For the most part Lussier does keep the movie interesting; this isn't an Iconic directing job, but good enough to make an interesting movie.

Like I said White Noise 2 is very character driven and Nathan Fillion is excellent in the lead role as Abe Dale. The makers got very lucky in landing Fillion who is a very talented actor. He really makes this movie a lot better than maybe it should have been. He's in pretty much every scene and he does a great job at carrying the movie. Katee Sackhoff as Sherry Clarke also delivers an excellent performance. She's a very talented actress and manages to light up the screen in every scene she appears in. Her character is a lot of fun and Katee really seems to be enjoying herself and any character who lists Bride of Frankenstein as their favorite movie is my kinda girl.

When all is said and done White Noise 2 isn't a great movie by any means, but does serve as a decent time killer. Odds are if you liked the original you'll probably like this, even if you didn't like the original you might like this since it's not a continuation. White Noise 2 had the potential to be a lot more than it was, but at the end of the day it might be sort of forgettable, but White Noise 2 is actually a fairly good movie.",1200268800,8,3010,4.341030195381883
3267980,4,B000YNFXZK,"I loved the first White Noise movie.  The whole concept of EVP just fascinates me.  When I heard that there was going to be a White Noise 2, I just had to have it.

This movie certainly does not pickup where the original left off.  It is a clean slate from the beginning.  There is no slow, boring lead in.  The whole story line was laid out in a clever and relatively quick fashion.  It is a little confusing at first but this adds to the suspense.  The special effects are good, at times, but nothing overly exciting.  The jump factor of this film was a bit weak.  Sure, there are some scenes that have the typical sudden flashes that make you jump a bit, but with a movie like this you would expect a bit more.  My wife hates horror films that make you jump, so she was quite happy with the overall mild fear factor of this film.  =o)

Overall I was quite pleased with this film and glad that I purchased the DVD for my collection.  It is nearly as good as the original White Noise, but just lacks a little punch.  The ending was somewhat confusing and leaves a bit to each viewers imagination.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  The story keeps your attention, the directing seems good, the choice of actors and their associated performances are very good.  As a comparison I think I would rate the first White Noise a 5, while I consider White Noise 2 a 4 and 1/2.  It is a great film that I recommend to everyone.  I guess I just didn't get the same thrill from this film as I did the original.  Maybe the whole ""Near Death Experience"" concept just isn't quite as mysterious to me as it might be for others.  I suggest you see the movie and judge for yourself.  If you enjoyed the first White Noise movie, I'm sure you will not be dissapointed with this one.",1200096000,7,1768,4.227544910179641

""White Noise 2"" (Also known as ""White Noise The Light"") however, stands alone with little connection to the first movie ""White Noise"".

Nathan Fillion leads the cast as Abe Dale and accomplishes something rarely seen in a move of this genre, a connection with the characters.  You're instantly drawn into Abe's world, and when he suffers a tragic and seemingly pointless loss, you can't help but feel for him.  We see a more vulnerable character from Nathan Fillion than we have seen before and he expresses Abe's loss in such a way that is truly believable.

Katee Sackhoff, as Sherry, brings a degree of warmth and joy to what could otherwise be a somewhat dark experience and the dynamic between Nathan and Katee works exceptionally well.

Anyone who is a fan of either Nathan Fillion or Katee Sackhoff is sure to be as impressed with this film as I have been.

I thought that the story and plot was pretty good and the actors were also good. I never heard of Nathan fillion before this movie. he did an good job and I would like to see him do more movies. and the girl who played sherry was also good. this movie goes to show that you can't cheat death or if you do or help someone that does if you got stuck with michales(Fillion) powers of being able to know when people are about to die there will be consenquents. so don't play around with the order of things. this movie did kind of stry off from the first but still kept up with it. all in all I thought that it was pretty good. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do,1377561600,2,904,4.027777777777778

Nathan Fillion makes a totally sympathetic character.  You like him and so it's easy to go along on the journey when no one else but the viewer gets exactly what he's going through or buys his story.  I like paradoxical endings and this movie, like the first, has one.  The theme of this series seems to be that messing with the other side before your time never ends well and it makes an entertaining enough story for me.

Like the movie ""Dragonfly"" it may not be a blockbuster, but it made for a good evening and I'll watch it many more times.",1307232000,3,748,4.232394366197183
3268046,3,B000YNFXZK,"**Dear John,

There are spoilers.

XOXO Jane**

I was very confused when I watched this movie because I thought it was going to be a sequel to White Noise.  The two are so very different that I can't really consider this to be a follow-up and so I am going to treat it like a related but very separate movie for the purpose of reviewing.

On one hand I really liked this movie; I thought it was an interesting paranormal / Biblical slant to take for a film.  On the other hand I also found this movie really amusing by the end.  I wasn't entirely expecting the direction that the film went in which is what made me settle on a three instead of a two for the rating.  On a technical note:

The movie has some very decent and very bad acting all mixed together; this makes it hard to stomach at certain points.  There are moments where the suspense is taken away by the hilarity of facial expressions, it almost bordered on B-Movie quality at a few points.  Then the next moment we're faced with some really well done dramatic scenes that draw you back in.  It left me feeling pulled away from the movie instead of immersed in it.

You can at certain points in the movie (eg: ambulance scene at the end) actually see the camera which should have been caught in editing.

The premise of becoming an ""un-tuned receiver"" able to pick up on white noise and the paranormal activity that resides within it was really interesting, along with the interpretations of what the white light (aura, halo, what have you) around individuals signified.  I wish that had been fleshed out more deeply, instead by the time we reached that point of the film it's a rush to the ending.  I almost wished that White Noise 2 had been about Henry Caine (played by Craig Fairbrass) instead of Abe Dale (aka: Captain Hammer - Nathan Fillion), he seemed like a far more interesting character and I wanted to know more about him.

We don't really end up knowing a lot about any of the characters in the film, even Abe seemed very distant.  We aren't sure exactly what he does, or his friend, or how he feels about much of anything.  He's there, he's playing God, and he'd getting his just desserts for it while being terrified of ghosts simultaneously haunting and leading him to those about to die.  I didn't feel any real attachment to him or the other characters, they just were and that was it.

Really the movie fell apart at the end for me; it just drifted off into the land of Happy Endings near the Eep! What Happened? ocean.  It isn't horrible though, and it is decent enough to watch once.  I would never see it again or suggest it to a friend, but it isn't a complete waste of time to see and you may end up liking it for all the little flaws.  I don't know why this is a sequel though, the only thing they have in common is (loosely) the phenomena of White Noise and people dying.",1307059200,,2861,4.344632768361582
3268047,3,B000YNFXZK,"This movie was really creepy for the first 30-40 minutes, then it just fizzled out. Still, if you want a good scare...",1296345600,,118,4.409090909090909
3268048,4,B000YNFXZK,"Check it out, really this movie should have been called something else rather than White Noise 2, and should not have been a direct to Dvd relase. With a little more money pumped into it and the right promotion, this would have been the sleeper hit of 2009 in the theaters.",1293148800,,273,4.372549019607843
3268049,4,B000YNFXZK,"White Noise 2 features a storyline basically consisting of a male actor who happens to look remarkably similar to Jason Bateman walking around a city and seeing brightly colored flashing images surrounding ANY person about ready to die in a tragic sudden way, whether it be children, women or men.  So what does this mean?

It means, for most of the film, the main character tries his very best to save all the people about to unexpectedly kick the bucket.  Does he succeed?  I wanna yell with a resounding ""YES!"" but eh... not necessarily.  Sometimes he saves lives, other times he fails.  There's some good action and suspense in wondering who will survive and who won't, however.  Do NOT expect to really get to know most of the people he saves- keep this in mind.  Many times these people appear once, and that's it- you never see them again.

Immediately you will probably notice that the film writers took a pretty cool concept from the original and beat it into the ground with White Noise 2.  The suspense does not really come from the unusual spiritual messages being seen and heard from the other side- more like the suspense comes from a man running around town saving as many lives as possible.

Whenever you see a flashing image of a deadly spirit being shown on a TV screen or any kind of electronic, it just doesn't have the same kind of heart-pumping impact that it did in the original White Noise.  For that, the film is a minor disappointment because there's no real atmosphere or for that matter, no real direction either.  The segments where the main character tries to understand what's going on by doing extensive research and solving math problems aren't exactly memorable either.

I can't really say you should skip White Noise 2 because if you like gimmicky horror that feels relatively low budget, the movie works great.  However it's not the real deal like the first one.  Nothing particularly creepy here.",1293148800,2,1933,4.7253731343283585

3268051,3,B000YNFXZK,"This movie is a somewhat confused, mish-mash of ideas that plays like a cross between The Sixth Sense and Final Destination. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense and the plot unravels badly towards the unconvincing ending, but the effects are pretty good and the story works reasonably well for the first hour or so. This is a perfectly watchable movie, despite the aforementioned shortcomings, and the effects are impressive most of the time and do cause a few jolts. Overall, not bad but not especially good.

3268053,2,B000YNFXZK,"Well acted, but very situation contrived. That took away from the whole concept for me. The plot involves the grand concept of that when people are to die, they should die when they are supposed to. And if you try to change the course of things, there will be a price. So being that said, you know everyone is going to die. Every scene is predictably manipulated for the obvious out come. No surprises.

It does have some well crafted scenes. The balcony piano scene is VERY well done.....reminds me of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Dreams/dp/0783235410/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Dreams</a>when Annette Benning falls from the bridge.

The reason this film doesn't work as well as it should have is that it goes for the easy CG supernatural horror ending as opposed to something with a little more weight to it. It's worth a view because it does explore some really interesting ideas and because of Fillion's performance, but not really much else here.",1214006400,,488,4.620689655172414
3268055,4,B000YNFXZK,Another dip into the Supernatural pool of EVP (Electronic Voice Phenomenon). This time there is softer plot line with less gross-out shocks and no evil demons but still has a understandable air of truth about the effects of near-death experiences. Nathan Fillion (of Serenity fame) plays the central character convincingly as a man with a burden of knowledge that can save people but for how long before the natural order of things defeats his successful efforts. The growing love of a nurse he has saved puts him in a terrible dilemma. As the realization of his commitment to set things right leads to a very sad and moving ending. The HD sound was very effective in adding to the shocking effects and eery music.,1209945600,4,714,4.766129032258065

3268060,4,B000YNFXZK,"Abe Dale (Nathan Fillion) watches as a total stranger walks up and shoots his son, his wife and then himself. Shocked, he mourns the loss of his family uncontrollably until he can take it no more and attempts suicide. But as he makes his way into that ever spoken of white light, doctors resuscitate him and he returns to the land of the living.

Thus begins a tale that seems to be headed one direction before it takes a disastrous turn. Now returned to life, Nathan begins to see auras around various people he encounters, including a doctor attempting to help him. The doctor describes the things Nathan sees and hears as a form of EVP or electronic voice phenomena (a phenomena paranormal researchers actually use).

But things go bad as the people he sees begin to die. Nathan realizes that he has the ability to save their lives and begins doing so, including a young nurse who consoled him in the hospital.

That nasty twist? It seems that once you save someone's life you become responsible for all actions taken thereafter. And since they were taken away from their time to die, they turn around and kill others. As Nathan digs deeper into the man who killed his family's past, he discovers him alive. He also finds out that the man was doing so only because he had saved them earlier. And they would have become killers just like the others he had saved.

Faced with this knowledge, Nathan must now go out and find those that he helped and stop them from killing. Caught in the conundrum of realizing he must take life when his whole goal was to save them, the moral questions Nathan deals with make this movie a complex thriller that keeps you in suspense.

Fillion turns in a wonderful performance, as he always does. The goal of an actor is to not seem to be acting and in all I've had the fortune of seeing him do, I've felt that in each role even when he faces the afterlife or squishy monsters (as in SLITHER). The rest of the cast performs just as well in a story that seems incredible but at the same time somehow believable.

Your views on the afterlife may not change after watching this film. But for the time you spend watching it, you will wonder what you would do in the same situation. And you will wait to find out just what happens to Nathan Dale and those whose lives he touched.",1202774400,4,2307,4.442080378250591
3268061,1,B000YNFXZK,"If you're reading this, I'm assuming you've seen the film. Due to this assumption, spoilers follow, so consider yourself warned.

If you haven't seen the film ... consider yourself lucky.

White Noise 2 has been called ""a retarded Sixth Sense"", a charge that offends both the mentally disabled and anyone who even moderately enjoyed the Sixth Sense.

While my expectations for any direct-to-DVD movie are understandably low, watching White Noise 2 actually lowered my standards to heretofore unknown depths.

From the Scooby Doo scares to the incredibly poor CGI effects, this movie claims its rightful place in bargain bins around the world and as a featured selection during Amazon's frequent $5 DVD sales.

Occasionally, bad films can also be fun films. That is not the case here. This film is so earnest in its attempt to be morose that it even renders poor Captain Reynolds unfunny, something I thought impossible. There are few things more off-putting than ludicrous trash that tries to play it straight.

After the movie was over, I played a game with myself called, ""Which is More Ridiculous?"", in which I evaluated certain aspects of the film in order to come to a conclusion about which, among  the many absurd elements contained in the film, was actually the most asinine:

Is it the doctor with the goatee and the earring who likes Elvis (he's got Elvis memorabilia everywhere! It's a character trait, see?) and runs a grant-sponsored ""ghost monitoring"" program, complete with requisite multi-monitor uber-hacker station recently borrowed from Kevin Smith's character from Live Free or Die Hard?

Is it that said uber-hacker station resides in the laundry room of your average suburban hospital?

Could it be that a man who attempts suicide can just walk out of a hospital, no questions asked? Or that said hospital has possibly the worst security of all time? A woman is brutally attacked and nearly abducted in the parking garage, and no one is the wiser. Nathan Fillion acts like a suspicious lunatic in the hallway, nobody says, ""boo"".

Could it be Nathan Fillion's silly urban hoodie / suit combo that he wears for more than half of the movie?

Maybe it's that the entire plot hinges around one character's bible-slash-journal which actually contains entries like a picture of the devil with the caption, ""Lucifer?"" Or maybe that said character (a convicted murderer) has been in an asylum for three months, and yet his home computer is still on and the screen immediately shows the last thing he was looking at? Or that his son is playing Sly Cooper, a PS2-era game on a 52 inch screen? Doesn't that kid know any better?! Hello, jaggies!

Or perhaps how the director loved certain shots so much that he shows them multiple times from different camera angles, to show us how totally rad they are? How many times do we have to see a piano fall on top of people? The answer, sir or madam, is three times. How many times must we see a bicycle-riding ghost go right through a car? Twice, because it's that cool.

Given all of this, it's clear that this movie should have been called White Noise 2: The Lamening (pronounced lay-men-ning), due to the huge helpings of lame it serves up at every turn. The plot is horrid. The pacing is turgid. The dialogue is insipid. The score is haphazard and an annoyance at best. The makeup effects were leftovers from The Frighteners (a better movie).

I submit to you that White Noise 2: Electric Boogaloo would have also been an appropriate name, as it would have tied into the whole EVP nonsense, and also indicated what a monstrous stinker this film is. The tagline should have been: You Won't See It Coming, Because You Won't Care.

There is, however, one redeeming quality to this movie. During one of the scenes, there is a promotional poster for John Carpenter's The Thing on the wall. Thinking of classic moments from that better, smarter film is what got me through this one.

To the folks posting 4 star reviews on here and dismissing the lameness as a by-product of the horror genre, allow me to point you towards the above movie as an example of how things are done right.",1202256000,5,4134,4.783707865168539

I was kind of expecting it to suck as bad as the first one, but I was very surprised, this one is actually pretty good. Nathan Fillion's character has a near-death experience and from then on he has the power to ""see"" people who are going to die within the next few minutes. This movie definately has more scary parts than the first one, which I thought wasn't at all scary. It's not an excellent movie, but it is pretty good.",1201564800,4,609,4.213675213675214

3268064,4,B000YNFXZK,"Considering the flood of direct-to-DVD horror movie sequels, this one floats to the top.  The original theatrical film with Michael Keaton left something to be desired, however, this new flick gives the titular paranormal theme a boost.  You just have to keep your EVP's and NDE's in order as you make sense of the plot and all the religious subtext.  My guess-- this could have been an unrelated stand-alone screenplay that was adapted to fit the ""White Noise"" genre.  Katee Sackhoff does a great turn as the love interest, and fans will remember her from her initial foray into horror from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Halloween-Resurrection/dp/B00006LPHA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Halloween - Resurrection</a>.

Since it seems horror fans will devour anything that has competent and creative effort behind it (even if it doesn't hit the theaters), we may be seeing more films like this hit the shelves and not the cineplexes.",1200355200,10,1072,5.58641975308642

8233502,1,B000YNFXZK,"Hands down, one of the dumbest horror movies I have ever seen. The plot is nonsensical and the premise itself is full of holes. Also, if you have any interest in actual NDE research, you'll spend a lot of time yelling at the screen about how much the movie gets wrong.

Don't waste your time.",1510012800,,292,4.3090909090909095
8233503,5,B000YNFXZK,Its a great movie. I recommend,1508284800,,30,4.166666666666667
8233504,3,B000YNFXZK,I watched the entire movie.  There could have been more meaning behind the 3 day thing and the end I thought was a cop out.  Nathan Fillion was great but the rest was just mmmmmm so so.,1507939200,,185,3.972972972972973
8233505,3,B000YNFXZK,It's not a bad movie if you're stuck in line at the DMV or killing time at a family Thanksgiving while everyone else is watching a football game. Certainly doesn't have the adrenaline rush as the original White Noise starring Michael Keaton. However I like actor Nathan Fillion who always gives a solid performance. I think he would have done a really great job with this movie if it had a better script & better supporting actors.,1505952000,,431,4.6103896103896105

8233510,4,B000YNFXZK,It's a surprisingly good movie. I just watched it because it was recommended on movie list. That and I like Nathan Fillion.  It was funny when he said something about being a super hero and captain tight pants! It was a good mix of horror and thriller.,1487289600,3,252,4.361702127659575
