1385387,4,B000050IMZ,"Definitely recommend this DVD for those who love stage magic.  Lance Burton is a master of classic sleight of hand as well as the large stage effect.  There are several complete Las Vegas shows on this DVD and for those who can't make it to the Monte Carlo to see the performances, this DVD is a perfect substitute.

As an extra bonus, Lance performs the sleight of hand routine that won him the Fdration Internationale des Socits Magiques (International Federation of Magic Societies) Grand Prix Award.

Definitely add this one to your collection.",1169424000,2,548,4.860215053763441
1385388,5,B000050IMZ,"If you like stage magic, this is the DVD for you. This product has excellent quality and it is worth every penny of its price. The DVD even has some performances of others magicians as great as Lance Burton.",1126051200,5,207,4.333333333333333
1385389,5,B000050IMZ,"This DVD contains 3 one-hour segments - presenting some neat magic performed by Lance Burton and several other people.  These magic tricks are presented, rather than revealed - however, there is a section with three magic tricks, I guess for kids, to perform - egg through bottle, how to make an egg stand upright and how to make a needle float on water.

Some of the magic presented by Lance Burton is vanishing several elephants, buried alive, lots of great sleight of hand stuff.  There are also few other performers demonstrating sleight of hand, even as used by card players to cheat in card games (there is some revelantion regarding how this works), vanishings, and fun tricks from the history of magic e.g. Light and Heavy Chest is demonstrated, rather than explained (you could find explanations in books related to history of magic, though).  The DVD is loaded with so many magic tricks that it is well worth the price.",1102118400,21,929,4.7875
1385390,5,B000050IMZ,This DVD is realy good! It's a very low price for the two first TV specials of Lance Burton and another one about magic too. Wonderful quality DVD. A must have for magicians and layman that love magic.,1051228800,12,201,4.315789473684211
1385391,5,B000050IMZ,"I have long been a fan of Lance's and decided to purchase this DVD.  Not only does it provide two of his TV specials, but it also includes his escapes ""Buried Alive"" and the ""Death Tank"". The ""Blue Room"" segment is spectacular as I see this magic used in many theme amusement parks for shows and attractions.  This is definitely a must have!",1046822400,9,341,4.396825396825397
1385392,4,B000050IMZ,"While this DVD is mostly a compilation of several Gary Ouellet-produced magic specials, one of which only tangentially features Lance Burton, it nevertheless contains some of the best magic ever shown on TV. The ""Hidden Secrets of Magic"" special is a look into some of the greatest feats in the history of thearical magic. No, you won't learn the secrets, but you will see them performed by today's masters. Charlotte Pendragon escapes, chained inside a locked crate dumped into a bay. ""The Light and Heavy Chest,"" which the great Robert-Houdin used to stop a war, is featured, and yes, it's the very same chest!
But the great jewel is the only video of the famous ""Blue Room,"" in which people visbly vanish and transform as if in a film special effect - only it was what audiences saw live - in the 1860's! This one segment alone, recreated for the L.A. Conference on Magic History in 1996, is worth the price of the DVD. Highly recommended.",1004572800,31,942,4.680722891566265
1385393,5,B000050IMZ,"This is NOT an expose of magic nor is it the FOX ""Secrets of Magic Revealed"" special... it is actually a beautifully transferred DVD version of Lance Burton's 2 TV specials! I have seen him twice live in Las Vegas, and these specials capture some incredible magic from a modern master. Don't be fooled by the title or the low price! This is a BUY!!!",1001030400,28,349,4.384615384615385
7928959,4,B000050IMZ,Very entertaining.  It's great to be able to watch and then rewatch Lance Burton's performances.  I've even been able to figure out (part of) one trick!,1395878400,,152,4.8076923076923075
7928960,5,B000050IMZ,"Best Magician in history! No one puts on a better show than Lance Burton! This DVD is hard to find, so buy it if you can.",1384473600,,121,3.6923076923076925
7928961,1,B000050IMZ,"The DVD has sections called 1 Code Unbroken 2 Secrets Unveiled and 3 Cheating Death.  The description on the case for the section entitled Secrets Unveiled reads:  ""Join some of the world's most famous magicians as they break their vow of silence to reveal their most coveted secrets in Secrets Unveiled"".  This is an outright lie -- it is absolutely untrue.  There is no revealing of the secrets or revelation of the methods by which the tricks in this section are done.

From what I know of Burton, he seems to be a decent guy.  I'm guessing that it is the producers and/or marketers of this DVD who are responsible for this dishonesty.  Fortunately for me I this is a library DVD.  If I had purchased it, I would have returned it and demanded a refund for the false advertising.",1358380800,2,781,4.5285714285714285
7928962,1,B000050IMZ,"Spent a wad to see Lance Burton in Vegas.  What a total waste.  This guy walks through his old, cheap illusions as if in a trance.  It's a show of women disappearing and reappearing in various boxes...wow, where have we seen this before?  There are no new illusions.  Technology has left Lance in a fog.

The delivery of his scripted verbiage, that he has probably done thousands of times, seems overly rehearsed.  This guy is so slow and mechanical you could scream. Worst of all is the way he womanizes anything that has protruding breasts.  I hate this guy.  Save your money.",1279411200,,578,4.588235294117647
7928963,5,B000050IMZ,"This DVD was a STEAL for under $10.  It featured 3 of my favorite magic shows from TV when I was growing.  Even though I already had them on VHS, it was worth it to buy the dvd.  I was expecting that it would be semi bootleg for such a cheap price but the quality is perfect.  Even if you have never seen these shows before, you will enjoy them and at the very least you will get a laugh out of them because they are from the 90's.",1205798400,,431,3.808988764044944
7928964,5,B000050IMZ,"I loved it.  I thought it was very entertaining.  I was originally going to show it as a reward in my classroom to 5th graders, but some parts don't really seem suitable for young viewers.",1200614400,,188,4.3428571428571425
7928965,4,B000050IMZ,"I thoroughly enjoyed ""Lance Burton Secrets of Magic"". It was worth every penny. Actually the DVD is worth more than the asking price. Therefore, do not be fooled by the price because this is a fantastic DVD for people who enjoy magic. My only negative critique is that Lance Burton's Doves and candlesticks routine on the DVD is not as good as the same routine performed on the Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. However, the routine on the DVD is still delightful. There is an ending section that showcases other magicians. This section is worthwhile and adds to the main entertainment of Lance Burton which comprises the first two sections of the DVD. I recommend this DVD to all who love magic and magicians. But it now!!!",1196640000,,723,4.700787401574803
7928966,5,B000050IMZ,"I ordered this DVD because I love the magic of Lance Burton but it actually exceeded my expectations. It actually includes three full magic specials from the late 1990s, two with Burton by himself and third in which he is joined by a number of other amazing magicians.

The award-winning dove act that he performs during the first special is worth several times the price of the entire DVD. Along with Channing Pollock and Shimada, Lance Burton is simply one of the greatest miracle workers with doves who has ever lived. But this DVD is filled with three hours of more great magic... including the vanishing of a whole heard of elephants, the production of a UFO and two of Harry Houdini's deadliest escapes.

Magic fans... for this low price, this DVD is a miracle in itself!",1185753600,,777,4.664233576642336
7928967,5,B000050IMZ,"A true Master of Magic, this is a packed-fill DVD of Las Vegas styled entertainment.  Sit back and be prepared to be amazed!",1178409600,2,124,4.391304347826087
7928968,5,B000050IMZ,"Gotta love Lance.  Unlike Criss Angel Lance doesn't use camera tricks, fake audiences and out and out edit tricks.  What you see is what you get.  It's fun from start to finish.",1171238400,3,177,4.46875
