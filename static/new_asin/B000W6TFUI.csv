8364291,5,B000W6TFUI,"Wow, I bought these DVDs to take with us in the car since we love the BabyFirstTV channel, and it was just wonderful.
In addition to the quiet moments in the car, which everyone can appreciate:), my daughter is really learning - she is repeating words, and as bursting in laughter when she sees her favorite characters.
I believe this is the best DVD set on the market.",1201996800,4,369,4.4411764705882355
8364292,5,B000W6TFUI,"I bought the DVD collection (6 DVDs) for my son, now 11 months old - he LOVES all 6 of them, but especially the night symphony DVD and the one called Cognitive Beginnings. The music and images are beautiful and my son can sit, absolutely fascinated, for a couple of hours and watch them, and I get some time to do things around the house.
This was an excellent purchase that we enjoy on a daily basis.",1201478400,7,401,4.220779220779221
