2732525,5,B000MGBLGO,I love any movie with horses and cowboys. This is really good. Has drama between a father and daughter that a little conversation and time spent together fix's. I saw it on the Hallmark Channel and I knew I had to own it!,1372636800,,221,4.162790697674419

2732537,4,B000MGBLGO,Jennie Garth along with the other actors does a great job in delivering the story line of this movie.  The emotional issues of this movie were told and developed well.,1371168000,,167,4.566666666666666

2732541,4,B000MGBLGO,"I bought this to add to my Lance Henriksen collection of DVDs. It is a good solid family movie. It's a good choice if you like a western,ranch theme.",1355702400,,149,4.172413793103448
2732542,2,B000MGBLGO,The movie was only fair in my opinion. Thats because the writer could have done so much more with this concept. Only worth watching because of the job the actors do in it. Storyline borders on boring.,1348617600,,200,4.4324324324324325
2732543,5,B000MGBLGO,I am so happy this movie was on dvd ....I just love it....it is a great movie.  Anyone that loves Jennie Garth needs to either buy this movie or watch for it on the hallmark channel...awesome,1334534400,,191,4.305555555555555

2732545,2,B000MGBLGO,"I generally like these types of movies, and was hoping to like this one as well. This didn't happen for me. The story line was too predictable and not a lot of believable emotion on the actors part. I wouldn't recommend this movie for others to watch. This is one of the very few poor reviews I have written.",1276300800,,308,4.237288135593221
2732566,5,B000MGBLGO,I ordered this movie on the recommendation of a friend.  I was not disappointed...it is a great movie.,1275177600,,102,4.666666666666667
2732567,2,B000MGBLGO,"It's been a long time since I bought a movie and read a magazine through the whole thing. Slow moving, story line could have been a lot better and acting too.",1274918400,,158,4.129032258064516
2732568,5,B000MGBLGO,"This is one of the better movies I have seen in long long time. This is about a young woman who has not spoken to her father in 8 years. Another death in the family brings her home and they begin to have problems when the Will states they are now co-owners of a large ranch. The debt is deep and the problems and excitement continue. Not only is there a power struggle, but there are many surprises and they just keep on happening. Eventually the stubborness begins to destroy what little they have left. They work together for the first time and they begin to learn how to make both their dreams come true. If you want a movie that will have you watching it more than once and at the same time shows you that no matter how bad things get, there are solutions...this is it. I think I have watched it 6 times in 3 days. There are parts of this movie every family can relate to.",1263859200,,876,4.158823529411765
2732569,5,B000MGBLGO,"Ok, I'm a sucker for mushy family-getting-back-together movies. For me, it's either a Christmas movie or this type. And this one sure fits the bill.  This one was done rather well.  And I guess I'm always surprised at how much I'm liking Jennie Garth.  I never cared for her on her TV series, but I sure like how she does in movies.  Especially the sugar-sweet ones.  Like her a lot here.  I like her spunky cowgirl vibe, her spunky mother vibe and her spunky take-no-nonsense-from-her-father vibe that she uses in this movie.  Throw in some great horse shots, some hunky men and I'm done for.  Lance has gotten the gruff, grouchy man down pat, like in most of his later movies.  He does soften in the end, and isn't that what we all were waiting for?  Watching him become a grandfather is so touching.  You couldn't ask for better landscapes to be mesmerized by, either.  Suffice it to say, you will get a good deal if you get this film.  This review is brought to you by your friendly, neighborhood mushy movie lady.",1256774400,,1018,4.497267759562842
2732570,5,B000MGBLGO,I really like Jennie Garth.  Her charrictor was really impressive.  The seller was fast and sent very fast.,1252454400,,107,4.888888888888889
2732571,3,B000MGBLGO,"This story has potential - and the scenery and the heroine were beautiful.  I'd say it was worth watching - even a second time.  I think it's also worth re-doing as a film . . .

The only things I'd change are:
  > The man she falls in love with is too hard towards her.  He may miss his previous wife but there is no reason to be as unkind as he is throughout the movie.
  > His bringing the pony in at the end is a little lame.  Again - if he hadn't been such a jerk throughout the movie his offering at the end might have made more sense.
  > The actor is fine . . . . I just think his character could have been softened up a little bit.

The gal that plays in this movie is so worth watching that she almost pulls this movie off in the end by herself.",1251676800,,755,3.769230769230769
2732572,5,B000MGBLGO,I am glad I added this to my collection...worth keeping for multiple viewings and a much needed dose of chick flick drama!,1214352000,,122,4.590909090909091

2732574,5,B000MGBLGO,This is a awesome movie. I was moved to tears a few times during this movie. It reminded me that alot of times life gets hard. We should all remember the things in life that mean the most!! What is important in life should be our focus......,1210291200,,241,4.148936170212766

2732587,5,B000MGBLGO,This is a totally awsome movie and I have seen it many times on the Hallmark channel and now am ordering it so to add the movie to my collection. Thank you and keep up the good work. The plot is so great and the actors and actress is fantastic.,1195344000,,244,3.9
2732588,3,B000MGBLGO,"Not a bad story, but needed more plotline.  Acting was good, but story jumped around and it was like the director couldn't decide on a plot line - love story, last cowboy, etc.",1192233600,,176,4.333333333333333

2732591,5,B000MGBLGO,"Just reviewed the movie - it was good - a good lesson in lack of communication between father and daughter - a good story line - sometimes

you have to hit bottom before you can start going to the top again.  A

good lesson -.",1179014400,,226,3.977777777777778
2732592,3,B000MGBLGO,"Released in '03, `The Last Cowboy' is a made-for-television movie that has all the ingredients we have come to expect from a film aired by Hallmark affiliates; rural setting, tight-knit community, broken parent/child relationship and the trials and tribulations of mending that brokenness and re-establishing the bonds of forgiveness and love.

In `The Last Cowboy' the child now adult is played by Jennie Garth. That alone makes it worth the watch for me. Jennie, I mean Jacqueline Cooper returns to the family ranch to attend her Grandfather's funeral fully aware of the fact that her appearance will ellicit a confrontation with her estranged Father (Lance Henriksen) and force her to deal with their strained relationship that has only worsened during her years of absence. Jacqueline soon discovers that the ranch is in deep financial difficulties and the only way to save the family estate is for the two of them to put aside their familial difficulties and work together to find a solution to their mutual problem. Of course you already know how this one will end don't you?

There are no surprises here but it's an enjoyable family film and Jennie Garth is lovely so give it a try.",1176854400,,1189,4.94
2732593,1,B000MGBLGO,The language in this movie was very inappropriate for family viewing and I would not recommend it to anyone.  I did not watch the entire movie because it never seemed to get any better.,1174867200,,185,4.4411764705882355
2732594,5,B000MGBLGO,I really enjoy any movie with Jennie Garth. She brings a depth to her rolls that throughly entertains us.,1173571200,,105,4.578947368421052
2732595,5,B000MGBLGO,I thought this was an amazing movie.  It hit close to home with me.  I love Jennie Garth as she is an amazing actress.  This movie was certainly one you could sit down with your family and watch without worrying about language or violence.  This movie inspired me to buy more like it.,1170720000,,284,4.30188679245283
2732616,5,B000MGBLGO,DVD-Last Cowboy came in excellent condition and the movie was very good! We need more movies that are clean and for family viewing.,1168819200,,131,4.739130434782608
2732617,5,B000MGBLGO,This was an excellent family movie.  Shows about healing and forgiveness.,1168473600,,73,5.636363636363637
2732618,5,B000MGBLGO,I bought this for myself and my daughters really enjoy this movie as well.  Jennie Garth is a fantastic actress; you can't go wrong!,1167868800,,132,4.5
2732619,4,B000MGBLGO,"The Last Cowboy is the classic western tale in a modern setting.

It tells a good story, is well acted, can be viewed by all ages, and in the end the good guys win.",1156723200,,164,3.823529411764706
2732620,3,B000MGBLGO,"I enjoyed the movie,but did not like all the pauses between scences.",1156032000,,68,4.75
2732621,5,B000MGBLGO,"I really liked this movie. I was somewhat skeptical at first when I saw Jennie Garth's name. But this is a far cry from Beverly Hills 90210 or her present comedy series. She really kicks [...]in this movie. For a TV movie, it was very good. It gives a pretty good picture of the ups and the downs of modern day ranch life...and family conflict also...but like all good westerns should be, the ""good guys(and gals)"" win. Very entertaining for an old ""wanna' be"" cowboy like me.",1147132800,,476,4.482758620689655
2732622,3,B000MGBLGO,"I loved the story here and the emphasis on trust in relationships - both with horses and people, but the language really spoiled what could have been a perfect family movie. It really took the enjoyment out of it for me, because there was no need for bad language in a movie like this. I was really disappointed in that.",1145318400,,320,4.35
2732623,4,B000MGBLGO,"I enjoyed the movie very much even though it was not exactly what I thought it would be. Return time was speedy, overall experience ver good.",1140825600,,141,4.461538461538462
2732624,4,B000MGBLGO,"I don't know what the first reviewer is talking about but THE LAST COWBOY is far from obscene.  It is/was a production for the Hallmark Channel, which doesn't tolerate foul language, and is known for the quality and content of its family friendly programming). It is simply the story of a father and daughter who reconnect/reconcile after the death of the family matriarch, and in the process save the family farm.  There is no sex, there is no nudity - it airs regularly (to this day) on the Hallmark channel I suggest those who can, check it out.",1134950400,,548,4.581632653061225
2732625,2,B000MGBLGO,This would have been a good movie it they would have left out the language.  We didn't make it to the end of the movie to see how many foul words were used and the extremitity of the language.  I wanted a movie with a good plot but without the language no matter how mild to some.  It would have been a good movie it the language was left off.,1116288000,,343,3.8714285714285714
2732636,5,B000MGBLGO,"A Father and an estranged daughter, both stubborn, fight to keep a Texas ranch afloat after the patriarch, his father and her grandfather, dies.  The will gives both father and daughter equal part inheritance of the ranch in a modern day western.  The problem  which propeled the movie along was a previously severed relationship between the two due to a rift because of the mother's death and the main characters inability to agree on a plan to save the ranch from being taken over by the bank.  Both Jennie Garth and Lance Hendriksen did an excellent job in realistically portraying their respective characters.  As a little boy was in the movie and the lack of objectionable material would make this movie recommended for family or individual viewing.  This review was based on a VCR recording from the Hallmark Channel March 12, 2005.",1111536000,,838,4.866197183098592
2732637,5,B000MGBLGO,Old resentments and seemingly impossible-to-mend hurts are resolved between a stubborn father and his strong-willed daughter in this modern-day western. Perfect cast makes this movie worth seeing again and again.,1111363200,,212,6.1
8168789,4,B000MGBLGO,"I watched the movie on the Hallmark channel and liked it.  Good acting, though the character of the daughter is that of an immature spoiled brat who eventually overcomes herself in the end to actually become a mature adult.  Her father (Lance Hendriksen) is a stubborn tough old timer who must compromise with his daughter's innovative plans to save the ranch and have a relationship. The real hero is the cowboy (old time friend) who struggles to bring the two struggling sides together as a family.
PS I guess I am a person who is somewhat clueless to stars of network TV.  When I bought the movie I had no idea who Jennie Garth was or is-I am a big Lance H. fan however.  At the end of the day what could go wrong with a ranch with an abundance of horses and cowboys. Contrary to a lot of the reviews, I was not looking for a dramatic masterpiece.  As a frequent viewer of the Hallmark channel, I enjoy the predictable feel good plots and endings which by real world standards may not be realistic-this is why I like this type of movie. In passing let me state that I am a grandfather who could readily identify with the position of the father over the daughter's-though they must both compromise and loosen up considerably.",1526947200,,1227,4.459821428571429
