8525171,4,B0084IV8I8,"The Great American Serial Killer is a dark and somber film that explores a more fictionalized account of Robert Kemps specific style and mind set. Although the film is very low budget and has a few quirks in the dialogue, mostly coming from the character of Robert Kemp, this movie is pretty well directed. It tries to tell a serious story without going for the campy or flashy approach that tends to turn serial killers into clowns or cartoons. A lot of the scenes actually come across as snuff material displaying a realness that makes the film seem like a real crime scene unfolding on film. It is raw and very uncensored even with the low budget.

This film at times is disturbing to watch mostly because even with the unordered and almost improve approach of Todd Servos character these were real crimes and the story for the most part is based on true events. The soundtrack and atmosphere keeps with the classic eerie creepfest reminiscent of the 80s slasher films like The Prowler and New Years Evil which accents the sinister subject matter of this film. If you're a fan of low budget Indie films and serial killer movies then you will like this film a lot. I had never really thought of Robert Kemp that much and now I wish he wasn't on my mind now after seeing his particular kind of f---d-up disturbia!",1433462400,,1314,4.567796610169491
