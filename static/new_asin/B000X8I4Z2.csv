What's interesting is that even though the pace is fast, the movements are simple.  Sometimes the footwork in Afro-Brazillian Dance can be challenging, so thank goodness Donna keeps it simple with excellent cuing.  The whole group looks like they are having so much fun that you can't help wanting to join in.  A fun, rhythmic workout with authentic Brazillian drumming.",1294876800,3,532,4.802197802197802
