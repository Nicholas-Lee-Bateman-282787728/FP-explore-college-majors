Well, to my shock and surprise I just saw it again from some 49 years ago.......I didn't laugh once!

Maybe when I saw it I was 20 and silly things made me laugh but my memory has fooled me and the more I wanted to see it, the more I was thinking it was so much better.

Sorry, for the fans waiting for this movie, but I now understand why it hasn't and probably won't ever get released, because its not at all funny in 2018.",1518307200,,597,4.129310344827586
8226433,5,B000X1CM02,I agree with all of the above comments. It puzzles me why this potential gold mine isn't produced for the folks that didn't get to see it 40 some odd years ago.,1451692800,,160,4.03125
8226434,5,B000X1CM02,This classic should be available on DVD; Doesn't really seem offensive to anyone.,1440806400,,81,5.3076923076923075
8226435,5,B000X1CM02,"Yes, I've been waiting for years too! Why isn't this available???  It's a great movie.  The scene where Bridges thinks he's dead is unforgettable!  It's been 40 years since I saw it.",1392681600,,182,4.625
8226436,2,B000X1CM02,"I first heard of this film during High School in about 1976 and finally saw it when it was on Turner Classic Movies recently.  I was very disappointed.

First of all, I'm amazed that the director, Norman Jewison did such a horrible job of directing this movie, since a great many of his films are outstanding: From ""The Russians Are Coming,"" ""The Thomas Crown Affair,"" and ""Fiddler On The Roof""... to 1999's ""The Hurricane"" with Denzel Washington, Norman Jewison is a very good director.  The problem with this film may have been that Mr. Jewison was attempting to mimic the directing style of the great Robert Altman (whose ""MASH"" movie would premier one year later) and he just couldn't do it properly. There are several scenes that will definitely remind one of ""MASH"" and ""Nashville"" but just not with the same fascinating impact.

Beau Bridges may not have been the best choice for the central character either.  Oh, he does a decent job of being a cute, innocent small town young man from 1910 gone to the big city to learn about corruption.  But he's just not very magnetic or fascinating in the role.  He simply doesn't captivate the way other young actors have so many other films.

The biggest problem for me with this movie however, is that the events in it are usually completely separate from each other with little explanation of what's going on, and very little set up or build up to them.  It feels very much like watching a long documentary of several islands, where one of the best parts would be the bridges, but they never show one bridge! So it becomes rather frustrating.  And yet there are many very long scenes of people talking about things in conversations that are truly dull.

If you want to see a hilarious, brilliantly scripted, produced, and acted comedy from the 1960s or 1970s with mostly innocent sexual themes, try ""Cactus Flower"" with Walter Matthau, Goldie Hawn, Ingrid Bergman, Jack Weston, and Vito Scotti.  ""Cactus Flower"" is the way to make a movie of the aforementioned genre which simply fascinates and sparkles.

This thing had me so bored I almost stopped it and deleted it half way through.",1379203200,,2136,4.725067385444744
8226437,5,B000X1CM02,"This is such a delightfully funny movie, I don't know why they don't come out with the DVD. I've been waiting for it for years.",1358553600,2,127,4.12
8226438,5,B000X1CM02,"I first saw this movie in a theater and then several times on TV. I even read the book. It is one of those ""sleepers"" that never seem to get the recognition it is due. Why it is not out on US format DVD is a shame.",1206662400,6,214,3.574468085106383
8226439,5,B000X1CM02,"The glorious Melina Mercouri, as we the Greeks call her ""Melina mas"" - which means ""our Melina"", stars in a magnificant movie full of agony, humorous momments and oustanding performances.",1203292800,3,187,5.266666666666667
