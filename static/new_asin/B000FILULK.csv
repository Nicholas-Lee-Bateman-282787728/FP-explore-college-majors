8123340,3,B000FILULK,"This is about a girl who loves to play the piano, but is unsure if she has enough talent to continue.

This is a sweet anime, but it's slow paced and doesn't have much excitement. That's why I only gave it three stars. I think young girls would enjoy this anime best.",1382227200,,267,4.134615384615385
8123341,5,B000FILULK,"I rented this from a video rental store and fell in love with the story about a middle school girl who is studying the piano. Her best friend loves to be athletic in sports and has a crush on a guy she likes. As the story goes on Mui and her best friend both have crushes on two different guys.

As Mui continues to practice her piano lessons, she gets better and even has a chance to create her own music that ipresses the piano teacher so much that he asks her to participate in a recital. She has doubts at first but as the story goes she over comes her fears and plays for a packed house...

This story is slow and about everyday life. I love it and it would be a wonderful addition to anyone's anime collection.",1379376000,,716,4.107142857142857

8123343,5,B000FILULK,"The beauty of this show really lies in it's quiet and subtle nature.  It has no explosions, no fanservice, no violence (save one instance of getting shoved), no coarse language, no deep government/dark themes, no real plot twists, and no magic...save the magic of music and everyday life.  Just 10 episodes long, I really felt that those were some of the most fulfilling and well spent 10 episodes I've ever experienced in a show.  It's very difficult to make a great show this short, so quiet, simple, and yet profound and lasting.

There are so many things that can be said about this show, many of which other reviewers have covered, thus I won't go into those again.  Instead, I'll share something I personally found very special.  The show isn't here to tell an inspiring story of a prodigy concert pianist, nor is it here to be a ""cutesy"" stardom success themed show.  It's here to depict the everyday life, struggles, and important (for her age anyways) decisions of a young teenage girl...who happens to be good at the piano.  Miu, a girl learning the piano.

I loved how music was ever present throughout the series and how it helped to serve as an overarching entity (albeit, in a non-literal way, ""personification"") of her life decisions she needed to make.  When young, we often go through life fancy free with simple interests, surface passion for many things, and without a real burdensome care in the world.  But as we mature and grow, Life begins to test our old passions, ideas, and ""old self"" more and more.  We are then presented with two choices for many things: do we let go of some things, or do we embrace bits of our past and passions - to take stronger ownership of them with an even deeper, more personal conviction than had ever been before.  This is what our young pianist, Miu, must deal with and decide for a myriad of decisions...Music not the least of them.

In addition, I found amazing how many wonderful guides and help she had through her journey.  From her spunky friends to her anticipating and subtle parents.  No person can build himself up.  The actions of those around us (both negative and positive, direct and in-direct) have an influence on our decisions and path.  Mr. Shirakawa, Miu's piano teacher, is especially brilliant as a character.  Very perceptive yet with cold mannerisms, he knew how to teach, lead, and sacrifice some ""likability"" for his students' sake.  Miu did not realize how profound and caring of an instructor she had until the end.  How often do we dislike people from the get go, only to realize later (even years later when they've passed) that they had a farther-reaching understanding, and saw something that we ourselves didn't realize in the moment?  Those are indeed thankless heroes...parents, teachers, friends who guide us and try to point us in the right direction when we need it the most, even if it means not being in our favor at the time.

All in all, this really was an emotional show for me, and beautifully executed.  There's something everyone can relate to.  It lacks much ""flash"", but sometimes, that quiet whisper is the strongest guide..the warmest company that matters.  Feel free and pick this title up.  It may be a wonderful reminder of the glories of living :-)

SPECIAL FEATURES:
This set does carry some worthy and intriguing special features: Character Bios, Art Gallery and Character Sketches, Two special Epilogues, Several Visual Monologues, 5 Side Stories, English Production Notes, textless opening/closing., and a 12-page booklet containing both Japanese cultural points and the typed out version of the side stories.",1326326400,,3622,4.845528455284553
8123344,2,B000FILULK,"The main character lacks any real vigor throughout the entire series.  She may seem different to some viewers toward the end, but I did not feel that way at all.  I feel the storyline was very boring and the little middle ""romantic"" situations were nothing too entertaining nor too graphic.  Easily a G rated series for younger kids to watch.  I do not think some older Elementary kids would enjoy this series nor older people unless they are really into Piano music.  Without deriving meaning from the Piano music, you may as well kiss your interpretation of the series goodbye!  I also did not like the ending because they didn't have her playing the song she created, which was not the ending credits music either.",1303257600,,717,4.696
8123345,5,B000FILULK,"This is, in my opinion, a great anime, the first eppisode is one of my favorites with Fredryk Chopin's Waltz in C# minor. The anime follows a middle school girl named Miu who is a gifted piano student, and she must decide if she wants to participate in a recital performing and originol composition. It is a sweet middle school romance series that spans only three volumes, and in my opinion, it is a really good anime.

If I rember correctly Ludwig Von Beethobven's ""Pathetique"" sonnata is played in exert on a couple eppisodes.

One of my many favorite anime, and in my opinion, worth owning.

This set of all three DVD's contains the entire series.",1301616000,,651,4.594827586206897
8123346,5,B000FILULK,"I decided to give ""piano - the melody of a young girl's heart..."" a try because of the title.  I figured that it should be a series that would feature awesome piano instrumentals and as a fan of Japanese dramas such as ""Long Vacation"" and ""With You"", I figured that perhaps I would get the same enjoyment out of this animated series.

Second primary reason for watching this anime series is that its created by Fujishima Kousuke (Ah! My Goddess, You're Under Arrest etc.) and features his character designs.  As a fan of Fujishima's work, I'm rarely disappointed and definitely wanted to support his work.

""Piano"" focuses on the life of a young teenager named Nomura Miu.  She has become somewhat of an introverted teenager and perhaps from playing piano all the time and getting good grades at school, the things that happen to teenagers starts to kick in.

She has an interest in one of the guys in school, she ponders on how her best friend has a somewhat outgoing attitude and has fun, she thinks about her parents and how her father is busy at work, how her mother copes with her father being busy and also her sister who is working as a tour guide and traveling throughout the world.

Of course, these thoughts are now cutting into her love for piano.  Her piano lessons are suffering and she's missing classes because she wants to be with friends and she doesn't know if piano is what she wants to do.  In fact, her piano instructor has selected her to be the student to represent the class for a major piano recital and it stresses her out.

So, each episode is more like taking a peek at Miu's life and how she views her friends and family and her love or losing love for the piano.

No major cliffhangers, no three-way love triangle, nothing emotionally traumatizing.  Just a straightforward anime on how a young teenage girl is coping with life.

And because the anime is done that way, it's actually quite refreshing and I really enjoyed it.

Because really, many teenagers go through what Miu had to experience.  Teenage life is never easy and it's like an emotional rollercoaster.

As mentioned in my review, ""piano - the melody of a young girl's heart..."" is a refreshing anime series, simplistic and primarily focused on a life of a teenager who has to make decisions.

The typical anime cliche storylines of harem or love triangles are also not on this anime.

It's a straightforward series about a teenager who has the talent to play piano but now her personal life, her teenage life of interest in boys, wanting to hang out with friends and be there for them and also to be there for her family has started to become important.  Where does the piano playing fit in and what happens when you start losing that interest?

I found myself watching this series in a marathon setting because I was intrigued by the storyline and although there was no cliffhanger that would keep me watching, the strength lies in its well-told storyline and the fact that all of us who have been teenagers have had the situations the main character, her friend or her parents have been in.

From the little things of losing a household pet and searching all over for them.  To enjoying a hobby as a child but then as a teenager, you start to lose interest.  And most of all, the relationships and bonds you have with family and your friends.

Granted, if you had a crappy life, to watch a series of a somewhat funtional family with a teenager on the straight and narrow may not be your cup of tea.  But all in all, I found the series to be enjoyable, background art to be beautiful and just overall, I found myself hooked to the series and how much thought went into the storyline.  Again, it's simplistic but yet effective.

All in all, if you are looking for a Japanese animation that is really different from other storylines out there and you want to step back from the action, adventure and emotionally depressing or dark anime out there, ""piano"" is a series I recommend.

Definitely check it  out!",1218153600,3,4000,4.563025210084033
8123347,5,B000FILULK,"Piano isn't your typical anime. There is nothing exciting or exceptional about the show, but that in turn is what makes it such a welcome break from the stereotypical mech-ninja-magic-fanservice animes that are all too prevalent.

Piano focuses on middle school student Miu Nomura as she struggles with the challenges of growing up. A kind and caring girl, Miu is also shy and outspoken, and has trouble communicating her feelings to others. She has been playing the piano since she was a young girl, but her heart is no longer into it, and her teacher Mr. Shirakawa notices it and is constantly harping Miu about it. Miu is also having her first crush, which further complicates things. This series is about Miu as she tries to communicate her feelings and decides whether to continue with the piano.

I think most of us can relate to Miu in some way. Many of us had taken up hobbies as children, whether music or sports or dance or academic clubs, and for some of us, the passion for those activities is gone and we continue to participate in them only as a monotonous routine. This was one of the major things that drew me into this series, the fact that it is so realistic and I could relate to the characters. Mr. Shirakawa is arguably the best kind of teacher, the type who is hard on their students because they want to see them unleash their full potential. The student typically hates this teacher at first, but later comes to understand their motives and truly appreciates them for helping them become a better person. I have had a few teachers like that, and they are the ones who are best remembered.

Piano is not for everyone. It is a slow paced look at a young teen's life, so you have to have patience to stick with it. If you do, you'll be rewarded with a truly heartwarming story, beautiful character designs by Kosuke Fujishima, and a wonderful soundtrack, where some of the piano pieces (including the introduction) were composed by Miu's Japanese voice actor. The show is spread out over ten episodes, which is probably an ideal length; I don't see this type of show working for a full 26 or 52 episodes. Ten episodes is enough for Piano to show Miu's maturing and opening up.

Again, if you demand action, comedy, magic, fantasy, or deep political/religious/psychological themes from your anime, keep looking. For those that want to relax with a gentle, heartwarming story that is beautifully produced, Piano is a perfect choice.",1163721600,10,2451,4.693023255813953
