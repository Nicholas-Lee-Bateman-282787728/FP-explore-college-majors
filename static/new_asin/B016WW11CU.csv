8737453,4,B016WW11CU,"Possible spoilers.  French director Francois Ozon (The Swimming Pool) is not one to shy away from provocative material and this gender bending film is no exception.  The film opens with a close up of a young womans face as make-up is being applied.  In the background, the wedding march is playing.  But as the camera pulls away and her eyes are gently closed, we quickly realize this is a funeral.  A eulogy is being given by Claire (Anais Demoustier) for her best friend Laura (Isild Le Besco) who died of an undisclosed disease shortly after giving birth to a daughter.  In a handful of nicely edited scenes reminiscent of the animated film Up we see the womens closeness develop from the time they met at age 7.  All to the films excellent musical theme called Enfance (Childhood).

As a deathbed promise, Claire is committed to watching out for her goddaughter and her husband, David.  After not returning phone calls, Claire drops in on David unannounced one day, opening the unlocked door after no response.  Surprisingly she finds David dressed as a woman, complete with a wig and stockings.  Shocked, she gamely listens as David explains his predilection for cross-dressing.  David assures Claire that Laura was aware and accepting as long as it was contained inside the house.

Claire keeps the discovery a secret from her husband Gilles (Raphael Personnaz), even to the point of assigning David the name Virginia when he is dressed like a woman.  Eventually Claire agrees to go shopping with Virginia, always careful that their adventures are as two women.  Virginia enjoys the looks of men, but I found this a bit of a stretch because Virginia is not a pretty woman.  Ozon, who also wrote the screenplay based on Ruth Rendells novel, introduces complicating elements into the story suggesting that while David/Virginia prefers women, she has elements that she really is transgender rather than a transvestite.  And Claire is seemingly attracted to Virginia at times but is she attracted to David or Virginia or just David when he suits up like a woman.  Then there are gay implications as well seen at a dance club.  In one silly scene we see Claires dreams envisioning her husband and David in the shower.

Thankfully, Ozon doesnt hit the viewer over the head with any of the options and perhaps suggests there are elements questioning ones own preferences.  Hell, I don't know.  The film is frothy and light for the most part and one that gets better and more complex the more I think about it.",1465084800,,2508,4.8243559718969555

8737455,4,B016WW11CU,"Director Franois Ozon pondered the mystery of Ruth Rendell's short story THE NEW GIRLFRIEND for nearly twenty years.

Major Short Story only spoiler:  in the story, surprises ensue,  friendship and intimacy grow, and after a shocking event, one main character slaughters the other.  The Short Story is genuinely Hitchcockian.

Ozon's adaptation is most shocking in the way the ending is altered.  Lovers of the short story will be doubly shocked.  But this is a visually beautifully film, in which character is meticulously and tenderly exposed.  Loss and love, and love recovered, are exquisitely worked out as intimacy builds toward a climactic event that does NOT end in murder, but proceeds to further complication and revelation.  The film is full of surprises--some amusing, some erotic, some truly shocking--but always masterfully guided by Ozon's sure directorial hand.
It will not be to everyone's taste, but I found it a fascinating alternative to the story, and beautifully cast, acted, written, directed, and photographed.",1460851200,,1034,5.4125

8737458,4,B016WW11CU,"The New Girl Friend,"" based on a short story by the late British crime writer Ruth Rendell, uses a cross-dressing male as its primary plot element in this tale of modern confused sexuality. Claire (Anais Demoustier) has been best friends with Laura (Isild Le Besco) since elementary school. Both women are now in their 20s and married. Shortly after giving birth, Laura passes away. Distraught and consumed with sorrow, Claire vows to look after Lauras baby, Lucie, and Lauras husband, David (Romain Duris). David takes to wearing his deceased wifes clothing and perfume to calm their screaming baby daughter, who responds better to him when he dresses like her mother. When Claire turns up at Davids house one day and sees him in female garb, she is at first horrified but on reflection concludes that Davids choice makes sense.

Neither a Mrs. Doubtfire nor a Threes Company, The New Girl Friend goes a different route to explore gender roles, with several surprises along the way. Director Francois Ozon throws in some humorous bits, such as a scene involving lower-back waxing and another in which David forgets hes wearing lipstick in front of his mother-in-law, but these seem out of place in a drama about friendship and the way gender often interferes with it.

With the TV series Transparent, the film The Danish Girl, and the headlines about Caitlyn Jenner, The New Girl Friend seems very much of the moment.

The Blu-ray release contains a making-of featurette, ten deleted scenes, and a theatrical trailer. The film is in French, with English subtitles.",1453420800,3,1565,4.988505747126437

We start the film with Lauras funeral  she leaves behind a loving husband and a baby daughter. Claire has promised to care for her friends family and after much grieving she goes round to the house to comfort David.
*Mild plot spoiler*
Once there she makes a discovery about David that will change all of their lives. Now to say any more would be a plot spoiler but if you notice that Romain Duris is credited with both a male and female part in this film it is a good indicator of where this is going.

Written by Ruth Rendell this is actually a very warm and caring film that has the air of realism throughout. It is the sort of film that pulls you in and keeps you hooked. In French with good to average sub titles regarding translation, you will also get some good make up and fashion tips. I really enjoyed this film and so find it easy to recommend.",1447200000,7,985,4.262032085561497
