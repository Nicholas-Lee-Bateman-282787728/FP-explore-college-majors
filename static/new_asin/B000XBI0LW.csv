8227721,4,B000XBI0LW,"Grade A cheese.  This is a shot on 16 mm backyard horror/action film made in Tucson circa 1990.  Its cheesy, ridiculous, and fun as hell.  Very homemade feel to it, with gym teachers playing evil satanists.  Recommended to those who like bad movies.",1424304000,,249,4.72093023255814
