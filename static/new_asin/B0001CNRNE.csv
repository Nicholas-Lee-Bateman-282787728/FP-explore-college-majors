1989577,5,B0001CNRNE,"What can you say about Lon Chaney that hasn't been said before? Well, Lon only appears in two of the films in this pack. The first is the obvious, The Wolf Man and the other is Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man. Both of these movies are true Universal Classic Monster films and they are monster classics. The other films in this set are also great Universal classic as well. First we have Henry Hull in Werewolf of London which is an eerie spooky classic tale and he is the true original werewolf. This film is set in fog-shrouded London and if that isn't spooky enough, the howling on the streets should cap it off. Next, we have She-Wolf of London starring that all-time tv favorite June Lockhart as the misunderstood one prowling about the countryside. Another eerie spooky tale if I might say so myself. I own all six Classic Monster Legacy Collections and I love them all. Don;t miss out on any of them, you'll be sorry you did.",1405814400,,931,4.482352941176471

1989579,5,B0001CNRNE,"So many thorough reviews have been written already, so I'll just give some thoughts on this collection of Lon Chaney Jr. Wolf Man movies...

This set contains four classic werewolf movies.  The best two are The Wolf Man and Werewolf Of London.  The Wolf Man (1941) is an all-time Universal monster movie classic.  Lon Chaney Jr. does a great job in his role in this black-and-white classic.  It's a rather short movie, but it is highly effective in its creepiness.  I also like the musical score.  The other movies are pretty good to great.

The werewolf, or Wolf Man, is my favorite Universal monster.  A man who's half wolf roaming around dark woods at night under a full moon is scary.  The werewolf seems to be an underrated monster amongst the other classic monsters such as Dracula, The Mummy, Frankenstein's creature, and the Creature From The Black Lagoon.  For me, Dracula comes in second place.

The Universal monster movies can't be beat.  They laid the foundation for the horror movies of future years.  This set is a great starting point for building your collection of movies that feature the monsters of legend.

Highly recommended.",1403049600,,1147,4.84020618556701
1989580,5,B0001CNRNE,"let get back to basics shall we, all these other movies can't hod a candel to the universal classics,the creature from the black lagoon,the mummy,the invisible man, dracula, frankenstein's monster(my personal favorite) or this one the wolfman... these movies intrigue me now as much as they use to scar the pants off me when i was a youg lad. the legacy line is a great way to gather up all of these classis's to veiw.....so turn out the lights get the pop corn ready turn the volume up real loud and have some good clean fun.",1394755200,,526,4.489583333333333
1989581,5,B0001CNRNE,"This CD arrived very quickly, and in perfect condition.  The original ""The Wolfman"" keeps the viewer in suspense the entire time. I bought this item for that movie alone.  The other 2 movies are OK, but not as great.  Despite that, I still give this item 5 stars. I wish all new movies nowadays had as good a plot! Sometimes I hear people at work talk about the full moon.  That's when I say ""Larry must be on the prowl!"" I never get tired of watching this one!",1392940800,,461,4.204545454545454
1989582,5,B0001CNRNE,"This is A great collection of classic Wolfpeople movies! I would recommend this set to any fan of horror movies. These movies are just as good today & must not be overlooked because they are filmed in black & white. Its just part of the charm of the classics & seems to actually add to the whole experience. You cant beat the classic, Lon Chaney jr. Wolfman, He was always my favorite monster!(Universal or otherwise)..",1379289600,,419,4.6
1989583,5,B0001CNRNE,"I appreciate the accolades for ""The Wolfman."" It's a well-done piece of genre lore and deserving of the respect it gets here. But it pains me to see the short-shrifting of one of Universal's most idiosyncratic - and delightful - pieces, ""The Werewolf of London."" If you get past the otherwise fascinating opening in the Himalayas, oddly devoid of snow, you're rewarded with an intimate look into the disintegration of a good man by mythic means, a true tragedy brought on by Dr. Glendon's excessive passion for his work. Jack Pierce, 6 years ahead of ""The Wolfman,"" created a lycanthrope to conjure with, looking as much like a human throwback as a wolf, yet bearing enough of that creature (pointed ears, piercing eyes, snarl) to satisfy. The film also soars on the wings of performances by Warner Oland as the haunted Dr. Yogami, and an astoundingly mature, 17-year old Valerie Hobson. A sterling and capable cast rounds out the performance, which is always full of fascinating, eccentric characters. A few scenes with two older Cockney women provide a welcome break from the downhill slide of Glendon, who has other problems besides, including his too-young, too-neglected wife. Spring Byington brings more humor... and some goosebumps... to the fray. To me, this is a film that stands alongside the best of the Universal horror output, and features a memorable score by Karl Hajos that was later used in the ""Flash Gordon"" serials to great effect. While I like ""The Wolfman"" very much, I consider this a more personal, more evocative story that, after all these viewings, often leaves me with a lump in my throat. It deserves far more regard than is sometimes afforded it, hence this very one-sided review. Bobbo 8-19-13",1376870400,,1724,4.948275862068965
1989584,5,B0001CNRNE,"Old horror movies are my childhood, and this set really brings back the memories for me.  it's a two disk set that has all of the classic wolfman movies starring some of Horror's greatest heroes.  The set itself is really nice.  it somes in a cardboard slip with a little plastic window for the creature to peak through.  The case itself is a sturdy, glossed cardboard book-style case that opens up to two clear plastic attachments to hold the disks.  The movies are all remastered originals, and definitely the best quality I've ever seen.  The only problem I have with it is that they used the same menu screen for both of the disks, so if you have a DVD player that has autoplay, you'll get the error screen until you manually navigate to the selections that are actually on the disk.

These are really great quality versions of the movies, I recommend getting the entire series!",1372204800,,882,4.579617834394904

1989589,5,B0001CNRNE,"My favorite Universal Monster prowls through the night in this mostly terrific collection of classic werewolf movies.

Lon Chaney embodies pathos in his portrayal of the cursed Larry Talbot--bitten by the beast & tormented to walk through the full moon night as a murderous half-man, half-beast. Although trivia buffs might point out that we never actually see the full moon in the first ""Wolf Man"" movie.

The sequel ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" is a lot of fun. The opening scene in the graveyard and the Talbot crypt may be the most atmospheric and chilling of the entire Universal monster series. Lon Chaney is once again excellent in his role & even the butchering the movie went through in post-production can't--for the most part--take away from the fun and thrills this movie provides & of course, the closing battle between the two monsters is fun--if a bit brief.

""Werewolf of London"" is actually the first sound werewolf movie ever made but obviously wasn't as successful as the ""Wolf Man""--but that doesn't mean ""London"" isn't any good. It's actually a very good movie even if the lead played by Henry Hull isn't the most sympathetic figure. He's actually the antithesis of Larry Talbot. But whatever charm Hull lacks, Warner Oland makes up for in spades with his performance as Dr. Yogami.

""She-Wolf of London"" on the other hand is very forgettable and the less said about it the better. In fact, I only viewed it once & haven't bothered to return for any repeat viewings. A bad movie but I guess they needed to pad out this collection with something.

Also noteworthy is that the Legacy Collection is missing some features included on the ""Classic Monsters Collection"" release of ""The Wolf Man""--namely a photo gallery from the original ""Wolf Man"" movie and the trailer for the aforementioned film. Still even with those few missteps, it's a wonderful dvd & if you overlook the ""She-Wolf"" film, a 5 star package of movies.",1358294400,,1943,4.875757575757576

1989593,5,B0001CNRNE,"I bought this one the same day as the Dracula collection.

The Wolf Man's atmospheric lensing is awesome; Lon Chaney is the The Wolf Man, in more ways than one. Claude Rains plays his unhappy pappy and, yes, that's Bela Lugosi as the werewolf gypsy. One of the greatest horror movies and still an inspiration to werewolf flicks and books.

Werewolf of London is actually a good movie. Released six years before Lon Chaney's classic, this wolfish tale is scary but the make-up seems a bit off.

Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man begins Universal's crossover between Franky, Drac and the Wolf Man, and it's the best. This is probably the first crossover/VS horror movie. Dunno fer sure but it's fun Stuff.

She-Wolf of London is eerie and borrows from Val Lewton's horror movies that being released around the same time. It is the least of this collection.

Aside from Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man I first saw the others on Thriller Theater the year I graduated high school. This collection is the first time I had seen the crossover movie.

It was worth the $18 bucks I paid for it upon its initial release.",1351987200,,1107,4.680412371134021

Werewolf of London is OK but Henry Hull is no Channey and it creeps along at a slow pace,the first change from man to besst is well done,finally the bottom of the barrel movie,She-Wolf of London has a young June Lockhart and that's about it,of course someone is trying to make her think she is a killer but well don't worry it will work out,ENJOY!",1325203200,,972,4.435754189944134

The Legacy collection is also great for anyone who wants to start a classic horror collection. The films are abit dated but hold up very well. they are also good glimpse into the society of the times as well as movie making techniques. The make-up job for the Wolf man is a great treat and is still the best even today.
There is a second feature with Chaney as the Wolfman taking on Bela Lugosi as the Fraknenstein monster. This is fun and entertaining also. The other movie to really get into I feel is the Werewolf of London, this was Universal's first attempt at a wolfman film and is quite different than the Wolfman.

1989613,4,B0001CNRNE,"I saw one of the ""Wolf Man"" pictures with Lon Chaney when I was in one of the primary grades in elementary school.  I was in the front row as they put the youngest and lowest grades in front as the children in the higher grades could see over our heads. It was on a Friday afternoon, and I, being just a child, had the hell scared out of me (the large bed sheet used as a screen was no more than 10 feet in front of me) when Larry Talbot changed into the Wolf Man in a jail cell, snarling and rattling the bars as the camera panned in for a closeup.  To mention just how effective the special effects were at the time, that scene created a fear that lasted for a very long time.  I was especially fearful at night when alone and for years afterward dreaded going into my dark bedroom.  No matter how I tried to describe my fears to my parents, they could not understand and never allowed me have even the tiniest light to allay my anxieties. (They were not cruel . . . things were simply different in those days.)

Looking back, I think that those original ""Wolf Man"" movies were the state of the art in their day and there are few things new today that can compare with those ground-breakers.

This is the first time I came across the movie (""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"") where I thought the scene was.  It was not.  Next I watched the first in the series, ""The Wolf Man,"" and it was not in that movie either.

This is the first time I have seen any of the ""Wolf Man"" series since I saw that movie almost 70 years ago, and I can still picture that transformation from man into beast, with the creature wildly raging against the confines of the bars in the cell.

Is there anyone out there that recalls this scene and in which movie it occurs? Perhaps I am recalling the correct movie but the scene was not included in the re-release.

I know the first movie by heart and see it often on TCM during Halloween.  The second movie isn't shown as often and is one of my all-time favorites.

In the ""Wolf Man Meets Frankenstein,"" they give us a chilling atmospheric opening.  Two grave robbers break into the tomb of Lawrence Talbot, who died in the first movie.  I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen it but the grave robbers learn the error of their ways.  Lawrence Talbot aka The Wolf Man is free again.

I hadn't seen ""Werewolf of London,"" or ""She-Wolf of London,"" in years.  But the addition of these two movies doesn't distract one bit from the set.  In ""She Wolf,""  Lockwood is terrific as the frightened woman who thinks she's a werewolf.  She may be, but I'm not saying!

1989617,3,B0001CNRNE,"Until now, Universal has done an amazing job with their legacy collections, condensing every Dracula, Frankenstein, Mummy, Invisible Man, and Creature from the Black Lagoon film into single, easily affordable volumes.  Unfortunately, the Wolf Man Legacy collection is where that all goes wrong.  This volume only contains two of the four Wolf Man films and, in place of the last two installments, includes two Universal werewolf films that have no relationship to the Wolf Man series at all.

The true crime here is that the Larry Talbot Wolf Man series is, undoubtedly, the strongest and most consistent of the Universal monster franchises.  It is the only series where the monster is played by the same actor each time, and it's the only series where we actually see that character develop in believable and logical ways with each installment.  Larry Talbot begins as a frightened child of a man who has no idea what to do with the cruel fate that has  been inflicted upon him.  By the time of Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman, he has become a stronger and more resolved character, desperately working in search of a cure.  In the two remaining sequels not included in this collection (House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula), this progression goes even farther, ultimately finding Larry as a tragic hero, resigned to work toward killing himself in order to save society.  It's rich, character-intensive stuff; the kind of thing you wouldn't normally expect to see in a Universal monster film, let alone a franchise sequel.

House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula are (presumably) not included in this collection because their titles suggest that they are Frankenstein and Dracula films, but this is not the case.  The Frankenstein monster plays an entirely insignificant role in House of Frankenstein, being literally reanimated at the very end of the film.  House of Dracula, on the other hand, features Dracula prominently throughout the film, but it is still clearly a Larry Talbot story, with Larry playing the central character with whom we identify.  More importantly, while both of these films include significant character development for Talbot, they do absolutely nothing to further the stories of Count Dracula nor the Frankenstein monster.  These are Wolf Man films, through and through, and they are as important to ""the Wolf Man Legacy"" as the first Wolf Man film included in this volume.

Well, enough whining.  So long as you know that you're going to have to buy two other Legacy collections in order to follow the full Wolf Man story, here's the break down of what IS included here.  Despite my low marks for this ""Wolf Man Legacy Collection,"" all of these films are worth a viewing:

*The Wolf Man: The first film in the Larry Talbot series is possibly the least interesting.  The action is slow-moving, and Larry is a bit too childish and helpless for my taste.  However, Claude Rains plays a wonderfully menacing father and brings tremendously rich conflict and emotion to the story.  With his help, The Wolf Man becomes a deeply psychological film, more about the conflicted relationship between prodigal son and estranged father than a blood-thirsty monster that kills people (but don't despair, monster fans!  There's plenty of the latter, as well).  Viewed in this light, the ending of the film is stunning in its significance.

*Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man: Possibly the best of the Wolf Man films.  Here, the focus is still fixed entirely on Larry as he becomes a darker, more tragic figure, mature beyond his years, and bearing a heavy weight about him.  Cheney rises to the occasion nicely, and the plot (which is far more busy and exciting than in the first film) certainly meets him part way.

*She-Wolf of London: Though the film begins as if continuing from a previous story (""The Allenby curse had almost been forgotten...""), it is entirely original and has no relationship to any other Universal werewolf picture.  It's an unusual film in that the focus is neither on action nor monster make-up.  In fact, you never actually SEE the She-Wolf at all.  However, this slow-moving film filled with two-dimensional arch-types does one fascinating thing -- it leaves us doubting.  The original plan for the first Wolf Man film was that they were never going to show the werewolf.  They wanted to keep you guessing as to whether Larry really was transforming or was actually losing his mind.  She-Wolf of London runs with that idea, keeping you guessing about June Lockhart's supposed transformations, and the revelation at the end is quite brilliant.  If you pay careful attention, you'll probably see it coming.

*Werewolf of London: Universal's first werewolf film, pre-dating The Wolf Man by six years.  It's incredibly well cast and features surprisingly strong acting for a monster picture.  It also contains a lot of subtlety, such as when a drunk woman at a bar orders drinks for ""two ladies"" and then comically reveals that she is the two ladies.  This tangential episode runs parallel to, and offers thematic insight into, a far darker aspect of the story.  There's also some stunning psychological undertones, as the main character's fear and rage about losing his fiance to a former lover seems to take its form in the shape of the werewolf.  It's a highly intelligent and complex script, far more than you might bargain for in a Universal monster film.  Really, all that weighs the film down is the werewolf, himself.  He's less of a monster, and more of an ill-tempered hairy man in a three piece suit who attacks people.  He can be knocked out with a blow to the head and killed with a bullet.  Theater-goers of the time complained that the film was too much like the story of Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde (that film had been in theaters only a few years earlier).  They were certainly on to something.

So, all in all, this is a collection of excellent werewolf films, but it loses major marks for not being the full ""Wolfman Legacy.""  I recommend purchasing this set.  You will enjoy it.  But the Larry Talbot story does not end here.  There's so much more worth seeing in House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula, but you'll have to shell out another $45.98 for the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frankenstein/dp/B0001CNRLQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frankenstein</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dracula/dp/B0001CNRLG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dracula</a>&nbsp;Legacy Collections in order to find this out for yourself.",1246579200,,6579,5.148775894538606

1989628,5,B0001CNRNE,"Universal's Wolf Man is one of the three classic horrors from that great movie studio.  Although few people consider Lon Chaney Jr. a superior actor, he himself used to boast ""The Wolf Man was my baby"".  As for me I always considered the Wolf Man my personal favorite.

Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man are almost universally admired as the original films of the classic horror series. From among these three creatures none was considered more sympathetically, or loved more than Larry Talbot. Let's face it, Lon Chaney was the Wolf Man and I think something about the big lug helped create the character so many of us loved so much.

The Frankenstein monster and the count were both portraid by several actors for Universal with some measure of financial success. Can you recall the Univeral studio ever attempting to have the Talbot Wolf Man portraid by any stand in actor?  They wouldn't even consider it.

This DVD was the result of an excellent transfer from a good film original and should be added to every collection of classic horror.

""Frankenstein Meets The Wolfman"" is the sequel to ""Wolf Man"" and is pretty good except for the miscasting of the great Bela Lugosi as the Monster. It's odd that Lugosi turned down the role of Frankenstein in the original film and Boris Karloff took the role and became a major star. Yet here is Bela walking stiffly with arms outstretched, grunting his way through the role.
""Werewolf Of London"" was the original Universal foray in lycanthropy and the difference between this film and the later ones is quite striking. Seldom seen, this film is well worth watching.
""She-Wolf Of London"" is a werewolf picture without a werewolf! And let me tell you, for a suspense film, it's pretty uneventful. Mercifully it only runs for about an hour!
My only complaint with this set is that they took the cheap way out and used a double-sided DVD for one of the disks. Would it have broke the bank to use 3 single-sided DVDs? I don't think so!

And the wolfs in underworld was caused by a virus that fully transformed the person infected into a savage beast. But please don't get me wrong the halfmanwolfs also have super strength and can run really fast and jump really high,,like the remake wolf demonstrated to us.

In my own conclusion to become a halfmanwolf you have to be bitten by a regular 4 legged mystical normal looking wolf..then that person bitten bites other people and turn them into halfmanwolfs...To become a savage underworld wolf you have to bitten by another wolf infected with the virus..The origin of the virus is unknown(Maybe Dr Frankenstein created it when he was playing god and accidentally leaked out....i'm going way ahead of myself here);;lol So all in all my friends i have found another number one film,,in my werewolf catogory..that goes by the name of ""The Wolf Man""",1167868800,,1325,4.686695278969957

the werewolf of london was made years before but has none of the charm of the makeup f/x's of the chaney movies ,it creaks with age but is fun in some ways.

1989648,4,B0001CNRNE,"In celebration of VAN HELSING, Universal has pulled out the classic monster movies and given them the royal treatment that has been long overdue to them.  This is THE WOLF MAN box set, featuring four movies about the exploits of werewolves

1. WEREWOLF OF LONDON (1935)
Botanist Wilfred Glendon (Henry Hull) travels to Tibet in search for the rare Marifasa Lupina flower.  During his search, he is attacked by what seems to be a wild animal.  In truth, he learns that a werewolf has attacked him, and that werewolf, Dr. Yogami (Warner Oland) warns him to be wary of the full moon.  Despite the warnings, Wilfred begins killing, and does everything in his power to avoid killing his wife, Lisa (Valerie Hobson)
Though the first werewolf movie to come out of Universal, it also plays like Dr. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE, but isn't very effective.  I place this blame solely on Henry Hull, who just doesn't make for a sympathetic or interesting werewolf, and the special effects are admittedly awkward
JUDGEMENT: 71

2. THE WOLF MAN (1941)
Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) returns to London to be with his father, Sir John (Claude Rains).  Shortly after becoming smitten with Gwen Conliffe (Evelyn Ankers), Larry is attacked by a wolf after it kills another young woman.  A gypsy (Maria Ouspenskaya), proceeds to reveal that the wolf was her son, Bela (Bela Lugosi), and by surviving Bela's attack, Larry himself will become a werewolf every full moon
Well, what can be said that hasn't been said?  THE WOLF MAN is absoloutely brilliant, and my personal favorite of the Universal horror films.  George Waggner does a fantastic job of directing, while Curt Siodmak's script is inventive and fun.  Of course, the best part of the movie is Lon Chaney, Jr., delivering his greatest performance as the Wolf Man.  Claude Rains, Evelyn Ankers, and Ralph Bellamy do a wonderful job of supporting him, as does Jack Pierce's brilliant makeup
JUDGEMENT: 100

3. FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN (1942)
Four years after his death, Larry Talbot (Lon Chaney, Jr.) is resurrected, and upon the realization that he cannot die by natural means, he seeks out a cure from Dr. Frankenstein.  But upon learning that the doctor is dead, he has nothing but the Baroness (Ilona Massey), Dr. Mannering (Patrick Knowles), and the Frankenstein Monster (Bela Lugosi), he seeks the doctor's aid to cure him, which leads to a showdown between the Wolf Man and the Frankenstein Monster
Another wonderful film.  Very atmospheric at times, and Lon Chaney, Jr. is once more effective as the Wolf Man.  The fight at the end is also wonderful, as is the film as a whole.  The only real fault comes from Bela Lugosi, who is a very stiff Frankenstein monster, though perhaps had they kept his dialogue, as well as his blindness reference intact, his performance may have worked better
JUDGEMENT: 88

4. SHE-WOLF OF LONDON (1946)
A series of grisly murders take place in London, leading Scotland Yard to search for a killer.  Phyllis Allenby (June Lockhart) is convinced that she is a she-wolf, as part of a family curse.  Her Aunt Martha (Sara Haden) tries to silence her niece, while her cousin Carol (Jan Wiley) and her fiancee Barry Lanfield (Don Porter) try to prove who the real killer is
Horrid movie by all means of imagination.  It was clearly billed as a werewolf movie.  Jack Pierce is even credited for his makeup work, but there isn't a special makeup effect or werewolf to be seen at all.  And the acting is stiff!  The only good thing is that the movie is short, only about an hour long
JUDGEMENT: 41

EXTRAS
THE WOLF MAN comes complete with a commentary track by Tom Weaver, providing one of the more enjoyable commentary tracks in the Legacy collections.  There is a brief documentary with Stephen Sommers, the director of VAN HELSING, discussing his take on the Wolf Man, trailers for all the films except THE WOLF MAN, and a wonderful documentary, MONSTER BY MOONLIGHT, hosted by John Landis
JUDGEMENT: 81

OVERALL
While the LONDON werewolf films aren't very good, the Chaney, Jr. Wolf Man movies alone are enough reason to have this box set, complete with the enjoyable documentary and commentary track.  Lacking compared to the DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN legacy collections, but worth the while nonetheless

1989649,4,B0001CNRNE,"What famous horror classic, panned by reviewers upon its initial release in December of 1941, looks better and better every year? THE WOLF MAN, starring Claude Rains, Ralph Bellamy, Evelyn Ankers, and Lon Chaney Jr. as the hapless Larry Talbot.

The story is a familiar one: Larry, the son of esteemed Sir John (Rains) returns home to Wales after many years in America, is bitten by a werewolf (well played by Bela Lugosi), and becomes a werewolf himself. What's extraordinary is the fact that the film can be so effective today.

The biggest reason for this is the acting. Some classic films, pre-Actor's Studio, look pretty pathetic when it comes to realistic characterization. Not so THE WOLF MAN. Curt Siodmak's excellent screenplay (likened to a Greek Tragedy) provides a vehicle for the stars to be at their best, and, boy, do they shine: Rains a tower of strength as the proud father; Ankers hitting just the right note as the torn female lead; Maria Ouspenskaya as the Old Gypsey Woman whose words prefigure Larry's doom....

But the standout is Lon Chaney Jr. A definite mixed-bag as an actor, he is perfect here--and this is a role calling for the use of all human emotions (unlike later Wolf Man films, where Talbot's head-pounding becomes monotonous). In fact, seeing THE WOLF MAN recently has convinced me that Chaney would have made the ideal screen Phillip Marlow (and I'm not forgetting Bogie)--big, tough, surly, yet charming when need be (a highlight early in WOLF MAN is Larry's attempts at flirting with Ankers; Chaney does the surprisingly playful dialogue with just the right touch). There's no doubt that his performance would merit accolades even today.

This is not to say that there aren't problems in the film. The continuity is off in a number of places (Chany transforms into the Wolf Man at one point wearing a sleeveless undershirt; in the very next scene, he's wearing a neatly buttoned Dickey), and there's a scene or two that's completely inexplicable (e.g., why DOES the Wolf Man pass out when caught in that trap?)....

But overall, the pace, lighting, cinematography, excellent musical score, and strong story propel the film through these rough spots, the 70-minute ride leaving the viewer wanting more. For these reasons, THE WOLF MAN is a classic....and a DVD worth buying (the extra werewolf films, particularly FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN, are entertaining as well).",1112572800,,2412,4.990049751243781
1989650,4,B0001CNRNE,"Among Universal's gallery of &#8220;Classic Monsters,&#8221; one of the strangest figures is the Wolf Man. Only the Creeper, who might well have been invented by Charles Addams, could rate as a stranger one, but then he only showed up in one film (House of Horrors). The Wolf Man, as horror film buffs know, is the nom de loup of Lawrence Talbot, who in the first movie returns to his ancestral home and soon afterwards contracts what Wilfred Glendon (The Werewolf of London) calls the &#8220;medieval unpleasantness&#8221; of werewolfery. Moreover, he contracts this affliction almost accidentally, when he tries to save a young woman from the ravages of a gypsy werewolf (Bela Lugosi), a bit like the guy who is supposed to have caught VD from sitting on an infected toilet seat.

The Wolf Man (1941) marks a minor turning point in the history of American horror films. First, its success at the box office convinced Universal to go over to the production of programmers, inexpensively produced movies whose short length&#8212;usually not much over an hour&#8212;made them ideal for filling out a double bill. Even more importantly, as far as horror connoisseurs go, The Wolf Man's grosses stimulated RKO to get into the act with a horror unit headed by Val Lewton, who presided over the making of some of the real masterpieces of the genre, like The Cat People, I Walked with a Zombie, and The Seventh Victim. But that is another story.

Secondly, The Wolf Man is possibly the first horror film to feature a monster as victim. This innovation appears to have been the brainchild of writer Curt Siodmak, who worked on a number of Universal screenplays in the early 1940s. Although two famous monsters, King Kong and Henry Frankenstein's creation, can arouse pity in us, they are clearly more terrifying than anything else. But poor Lawrence Talbot who never wanted to be a werewolf was doomed to stagger through a series of movies, seeking a cure for his rare ailment while leaving in his wake a trail of wolfbane and dead bodies. While this was a peculiar fate for a monster, a similar if more mundane scenario&#8212;in which the protagonist seems to be losing his or her identity&#8212;was quickly going to become a staple feature of the psychological thriller, just beginning to come into vogue when The Wolf Man came out.

Probably it was the interest in psychoanalysis, triggered off by the arrival of a number of prestigious refugee analysts in the United States, as much as anything else that fueled the rise of the psychological thriller in the war years. Dramas of dual identity had played a conspicuous role in German horror pictures like The Student of Prague (1913; 1926) and Orlac's Hands (1925), but the theme had mainly cropped up in the United States in two versions of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, both made by Paramount&#8212;one in 1920, and the other in 1931. In retrospect, both The Wolf Man and MGM's tony 1941 remake of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde, starring Spencer Tracy and Ingrid Bergman, can be seen as prelusive to an important body of movies including George Cukor's Gaslight, Alfred Hitchcock's Spellbound, and Robert Siodmak's Dark Mirror.

Sadly, the Wolf Man role belonged to Lon Chaney Jr., one of the most inept performers in the annals of the horror film. The bearer of one of the great names of the silent era, Chaney inherited little of his father's estimable talent. As Carlos Clarens pointed out in An Illustrated History of Horror and Science-Fiction Films, it is most often supporting players like Lionel Atwill or George Zucco who stand out in Universal's 1940s celluloid Grand Guignol. The Wolf Man is no exception to this rule. Maria Ouspenskaya is quite entertaining as Maleva, but Claude Rains insufferably smug as Talbot pre, while a memorable fading star of the 1930s, Warren William, makes a marginal contribution to the action, and Bela Lugosi makes an even more marginal one as the cause of all of Talbot's subsequent lycanthropic travails. Nevertheless, the real stars of such latter day Universal horror productions were the highly talented technicians who collaborated on them like the cinematographers Joseph Valentine and George Robinson, the special effects wizard John Fulton, and makeup artist Jack Pierce.

Among the films in this set, I would single out for attention Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, the work of Roy William Neill, who did a more than competent job of directing most of the Sherlock Holmes movies starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce. The movie ultimately degenerates into utter nonsense&#8212;Lugosi, outrageously miscast as the Frankenstein monster, is not horrifying, just plain horrible&#8212;but it opens with a wonderfully eerie sequence in which two grave robbers unwisely decide to desecrate the Talbot family crypt. For an instant, in an establishing shot of the Llanwelly churchyard, Universal itself returns to life from the schlock Hades into which it had descended&#8212;and into which it was about to fall again in the following reels.

Viewers who want to pursue the further vicissitudes of the Wolf Man&#8212;in The House of Frankenstein and The House of Dracula&#8212;will have to invest in two other sets. Here, he shares the stage with a pair of rival lycanthropes, one real, the other only a &#968;&#949;&#965;&#948;&#959;&#955;&#973;&#954;&#959;&#962;. These are The Werewolf of London and The She-Wolf of London, for which I have written an Amazon review posted elsewhere. The first of these is a respectable, although by no means great horror film with Henry Hull&#8212;whose pained look suggests he needs cascara more than the moonflower that cures werewolfism&#8212;in the lead role, abetted by Warner Oland as a rival damned soul from the U of Carpathia. The second is the most negligible of the efforts in this set, scantly saved for indefatigable horror addicts by a couple of effective nocturnal compositions courtesy of Maury Gertsman.",1109030400,,5941,5.088205128205129
1989651,5,B0001CNRNE,"This DVD set is the ultimate!  From the beginning, I have always loved werewolves.  And when I finally saw a movie that I had been looking for since I first got interested in werewolf films, I knew this was for me.

As for the movie ""She-Wolf of London"", I had never heard of it.  It is what's related to how Alfred Hitchcock got started--through conspiracy that resulted in horrifying incidents.  In the end, though, I didn't like the plot once it was explained.  I wanted a classic werewolf.  Well, I guess I just didn't get that!

All in all, though, I really enjoyed this collection.  I especially appreciated learning about the fact that Larry Talbot went on even after ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"".  I hope you enjoy it, and happy howling!",1101513600,,749,4.648854961832061
1989652,4,B0001CNRNE,"This collection of classic werewolf films bring back memories of staying up late on weekends and watching monster movies on TV.  Although I didn't care much for ""Werewolf of London"" or ""She-Wolf"", the original ""Wolfman"" and ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"", starring Claude Rains, Bela Lugosi, and the impeccable Lon Chaney make this DVD special.

Chaney gives excellent performances in both films as Larry Talbot, a man who, in the first wolfmam film, is bitten by a werewolf, played by Lugosi.  From then on, whenever there's a full moon, Larry undergoes a metamorphisis into the wolf creature, stalking the night and terrorizing people.

In ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"", Chaney reprises his famous fole, and Lugosi plays the part of Frankenstein, a role he previously turned down, and which was made famous by Boris Karloff.  Ultimately, the monster and wolfman end up fighting each other at the end of the film while the townspeople try to destroy Frankenstein castle.

This is a good DVD.  Chaney and Lugosi give memorable performances in their respective roles, and the settings and scenery, especislly the rolling fog throughout the films, gives them an even creepier feel to them.  Although I didn't care for the other two films on the disc, ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"" and the original ""Wolfman"" make this disc worth the price.  Watch this collection of horror films and experience some good classic horror at its best.",1099180800,,1437,5.133047210300429
1989653,4,B0001CNRNE,"As a fan of all manner of movies and someone interested in the old Universal Horror characters, I must say I am pleased that the new VanHelsing movie did one good thing in getting all these old film series on DVD.  As someone who's always preferred werewolves to vampires and who finds there aren't anywhere near as many good werewolf movies as there are good vampire movies, I chose this set first.  The extras on this set are very much worth it, giving the history of the character and other fun facts that can add depth to your viewing experience.  After all, the Wolf Man was the only one of the classic Universal monsters to always be played by the same actor, Lon Chaney Jr.

As for the films themselves, while hokey compared to today's horror films, they have a good deal of style of their own.  Chaney doesn't quite come across as the son of the English lord (in fact, he's not a particularly good actor for the dramatic parts compared to some of his co-stars), but his watery eyes and pathetic demeanor show a man who is really haunted by the fact that for a couple days a month he turns into a ferious beast-man.

That said, there is one stinker in the set, the ""She-Wolf of London"".  Starring a very young June Lockhart, this movie doesn't even have a werewolf in it (preventing me from making the obvious, ""She also played Lassie"" joke).  About the only good thing about ""She-Wolf"" is it's short, barely over an hour.  Otherwise, it's predictable (I figured out who did it and how before I was told), overly melodramatic, and not particularly scary even by the standards of the other films.

As for the rest, ""Werewolf of London"" was actually very good, complete with a couple comic relief old ladies with drinking habits that were actually somewhat funny, and a good plot.  ""Frankenstien Meets the Wolf-Man"" worked well aside from Chaney's delivery of some of his lines, and Bela Lugosi had his only turn as Frankenstien's monster.  And the main feature, ""The Wolf Man"", still packs the punch it's always had.",1098921600,,2022,4.6016713091922
1989654,5,B0001CNRNE,"To me,the wolf man is the greatest universal monster of them all. Lon Chaney had the pathos that Lugosi lacked, to carry off his character. And he used to scare the bejesus out of me when I was a kid!!!

Anyway, I think they have done a remarkable job with this new DVD transfer. The extras are excellent, the picture clear and the sound wonderful. Although I did read of the problems a lot of customers were having with their discs, I acually had a problem with one of the extra programmes, a documentary,that wouldn't play. I took it back to the store and they replaced it and this one is fine. What a shame that something that has been packaged and remastered so well has to be flawed!

But the film still stands up well against time,probably better than most of them,certainly Dracula which, I find, is rather stiff and boring (a vampire without teeth???).

You also get 'Werewolf of London' which is pretty good, 'Frankenstein vs Wolfman' which is better and 'She Wolf of London' which is a complete waste of time. It would have been better if they had of added 'House of frankie' and 'House of Dracula' to continue the wolfman saga and ditched 'She wolf' to the garbage bin where it belongs. But beggars can't be choosers and you're getting 4 films and a documentary for $20.00. It can't be bad,right? I just now have to get 'Frankenstein' and boring 'Dracula' to complete the exiting Wolfman set.",1092700800,,1403,4.559523809523809
1989655,4,B0001CNRNE,"Poor Larry Talbot. Frankenstein may be generally a good person but he's arrogant enough to challenge the forces of nature and risk lives to achieve his goals.  Dracula is a force of pure malevolence.  Larry Talbot, however, is a nice guy who by accident is turned into a murderous creature and is wracked with guilt because of it.

The Wolf Man begins Talbot's saga.  Bitten by a werewolf, he soon becomes one himself, both incredibly strong and incredibly murderous.  Lon Chaney is at his best in his original turn as Talbot, faced with becoming a killer against his will.  In Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, he begins his quest for a cure after learning that not even death will permanently rid him of his curse; in the process, he meets Frankstein's creature, which sets up a battle between the two monsters at the climax.  Both movies are satisfying if not really spectacular B movies.

For the other Lon Chaney/Wolf Man movies, the viewer must turn to House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula in the other ""Legacy"" collections; Chaney's final turn in Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein is not included in any of the collections.  The remaining two movies in The Wolf Man set are completely separate stories.  Werewolf of London, noted as being the first werewolf movie, is decent enough, featuring two werewolves who are more demonic than beastly.  She-Wolf of London, on the other hand, is decidedly weak (in fact the weakest in all the whole set of ""Legacy"" films):  the story of a girl under a supposed curse that turns her into a wolf, it is more of a mystery than a supernatural thriller and most viewers will have the whole thing figured out long before the end.

Of the three ""Legacy"" collections, this is probably the weakest in the bunch, but it has enough fun stuff in it to merit a weak four stars.  If your budget, however, limits your purchases, go with the Frankenstein collection instead and save this for a later day.",1092700800,,1944,4.71301775147929
1989656,4,B0001CNRNE,"First of all, the credit given to Claude Rains is incorrect. Lon Chaney Jr. is the actor to whom the credit is due. Although Henry Hull made the transformation first in ""Werewolf of London"" (1935), almost everyone agrees that Chaney's 1941 version ""The Wolf Man"" is the true origin of the film iconization of the character. The deep tragedy in Chaney's portrayl is nothing short of brilliant.
Frankenstein meets The Wolfman is a moderate film, save Lugosi's performance of the Frankenstein monster, whose facial expressions so closley mimic that of his Dracula (1931), that it seems as though the two characters have merged in a shorter less vivid one.
She-of London is probabaly my least favorite of the four, but all-in-all the performances are fairly solid.
The DVD collection is a must-have for fans of the period and genre. It is beautifully packaged and has cool and interesting extras.",1089676800,,892,4.993288590604027
1989657,5,B0001CNRNE,"Another great collection from Universal! This time, it's the Wolf Man who gets the star treatment. In the original WOLF MAN, Lon Chaney jr. is Lawrence Talbott, son of sir Jonathon Talbott (Claude Raines). Larry gets bitten by a werewolf (Bela Lugosi) and starts the whole full-moon-rampage-thing. A classic. Next up is FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN. Lon jr. returns as lycanthropic Larry Talbott, trying to find a way to be destroyed, thus ending his torment. Ends in the legendary battle between the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster! Third, we have SHE WOLF OF LONDON, starring June Lockhart as a woman who is either a murderous beast, or is being framed in a hideous plot to drive her insane. Lockhart is great, showing a charm and innocense that make SWOL more than just another gothic mystery. Lastly, we get WEREWOLF OF LONDON, about a botonist attacked by a werewolf while attempting bring a rare tibeten flower back to London. This flower only blooms at night, during the full moon, and can keep a man from tansforming into a werewolf. This should help our hero, but alas, the werewolf who bit him is now in London too, seeking to have the flower for himself! Not a bad entry in the wolftale anthology. Buy this now, before Universal gets stingy again! Highly recommended...",1089158400,,1287,4.828054298642534
1989658,5,B0001CNRNE,"I had never really thought of The Wolf Man as being in the same league as Dracula and Frankenstein's Monster - I was wrong.  Watching Lon Chaney, Jr.'s portrayal of Larry Talbot in The Wolf Man and Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man has opened my eyes.  Chaney's Wolf Man is by far the most sympathetic of Universal's three major monsters.  Dracula loves being Dracula, Frankenstein's monster is a full-time monster made out of dubious body parts, yet Larry Talbot is a victim of cruel fate.  Rushing in to help a damsel in distress, he sustains a bite from a werewolf - hardly the type of reward a hero deserves.  Doing the things a werewolf does is bad enough, but Talbot knows he is a werewolf and has to spend all of his normal waking hours wallowing in mental agony, knowing he can do nothing to contain the hairy monster lurking within.  Beginning with his resurrection in Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man, Talbot's overriding ambition and sole wish is to die and be freed from the curse forever, yet he now knows he can never die- not by conventional means, anyway.  He truly is a lost soul trapped in a nightmare from which there seems to be no escape.  This was the role Chaney was born to play, and he delivered one amazing performance after another in his five werewolf films.  The Wolf Man Legacy Collection contains only two of them, the original The Wolf Man from 1941 and the sequel/monster crossover film Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man (1942).  Chaney's Wolf Man also appears in House of Frankenstein and House of Dracula, each of which can be found on the Frankenstein and Dracula Legacy Collections, respectively.
The Wolf Man has exerted a huge influence on the art of horror for over six decades now, thanks to the heralded make-up prowess of Jack Pierce, the tight and powerful script of Curt Siodmak, some impressive photography work, a moving musical score, and wonderful performances from a truly stellar cast of actors and actresses (including Claude Raines in the role of Larry Talbot's father, Maria Ouspenskava as the gypsy woman and surrogate mother figure to Larry, and the great Bela Lugosi in a somewhat minor yet crucial role).  Chaney's Wolf Man appearance is amazingly vivid and, one supposes, somewhat frightening to moviegoers of the early 1940s.  His emotional performance adds to his character's tragic status; his strange and slightly awkward manner, tempered by a sort of gentle slowness always leaves me mesmerized.
With the success of The Wolf Man in 1941, it didn't take Universal long to trot out a sequel; the following year, Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man not only capitalized on the success of everybody's favorite werewolf, it also brought in Frankenstein's monster, thus becoming one of the first Universal monster cross-over films.  Lon Chaney, Jr., returns as the ill-fated Larry Talbot, and the legendary Bela Lugosi dons the makeup of the Frankenstein monster - this fact alone makes the film intriguing.  Talbot, now afraid he cannot die, longs to be killed and put out of his misery.  He ends up at the castle of Frankenstein, where a helpful young doctor promises to help him and destroy Frankenstein's monster in the process - things don't quite work out that way, and the film ends with a monster grudge match between the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's Monster.
Werewolf of London (1935) and She-Wolf of London (1946) could not be more different, and both are unmistakably distinct from the Universal werewolf films starring Lon Chaney, Jr., yet I think they both work marvelously.  Many fans don't care for them, especially She-Wolf in London, but I find both films quite compelling.  They differ significantly from the storyline running through Chaney's Wolf Man films, but these two films have a great deal of their own to offer fans.  Often overlooked and unduly dismissed by some reviewers and horror fans, these are two classic werewolf films.
In terms of extras, you get trailers for three of the four films, a truly excellent commentary of The Wolf Man by film historian Tom Weaver, a well-made 1999 documentary called Monster By Moonlight, and comments on the Wolf Man character by Van Helsing director Stephen Sommers.  With only four movies and relatively few extras, The Wolf Man Legacy Collection falls a little short in the value department compared to the Dracula and Frankenstein Legacy Collection sets, but nothing can change the fact that this is must-have material for fans of classic horror movies.",1086307200,,4472,4.915006640106242
1989659,4,B0001CNRNE,"O.k., I'm not a big fan of old monster movies, but 30 bucks for four, oh yeah.  The extras are definately good too, giving a good deal of information on the Wolfman, and monsters in general.  Here are my thoughts on the movies individually:

The Wolfman:  Reasonably good, although like all these movies it's very short and the guy doesn't even become a werewolf until it's half over.  It becomes incredible with the commentary on to explain about the making, and tell alot of information about the various versions of the movie's script (there were three; one in 1932 that wasn't made because it would have offended Catholics, one that was the script until weeks before shooting and would have left the question of whether or not Larry (Gill not Talbot in this version) was turning into a wolf open (you only saw the wolf as a reflection through Larry's eyes), and the one that was made.  He also points out the plotholes (probably left-overs from script changes).  There are a good number of holes to laugh at, but I don't blame them since this was probably done on the budget of two or three ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.

Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man:  This is actually better in some ways than the original.  While the idea sounds rediculous, and the excuse for the final battle seems silly, the opening is actually spookier (I won't say ""scarier"" because nothing in any of these movies are truly scary in our world) than the original.

She-Wolf of London:  This is not a Werewolf movie.  It's a murder-mystery in which the murderor is trying to convince a girl she's turning into a Werewolf because the girl believes her family is cursed.  While I suppose the various instances in which it was implied she was a werewolf could be explained as part of an elaborate scheme, I can't help but think this was suppose to be more along the lines of the second aforementioned ""Wolfman"" script until the end when you saw the She-Wolf (or maybe even only saw it as a reflection), but the studio got cheap and wouldn't buy the make-up.  I can't prove that, but I suspect it.  I did not like this movie, but I don't blame them for having a filler(the only movies with the actual Wolfman are either in this set, in another Monster Legacy set, or ""Abbot and Castello mee Frankenstein"" which both doesn't have the Wolfman name in the title and was a comedy; the only real other black-and-white Werewolf movie I guess they had was ""Werewolf of London"").

Werewolf of London:  Not much to say about this, it was OK, but I never really got into it.",1085184000,,2535,4.583148558758315

This product has two DVDs with four monochrome movies from the 1930s and 1940s. The first DVD has the ""The Wolf Man"" and ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolfman"". The second double-sided DVD has ""She-Wolf of London"" and ""Werewolf of London"". These movies are digitally enhanced and better than the versions on old videotapes. The legends of a man (wer) who turned into a wolf go back thousands of years among many nations. This change only happens at night, the man's family was unaware of this condition. When killed the werewolf resumed his human form. This should not be confused with lycanthropy, a mental illness where a man claims to be a wolf (but can't change his appearance). Writer Curt Siodmak was credited with inventing many legends about werewolves (and vampires). Elliot O'Donnell wrote the book ""Werewolves"" for a scholarly account of the old legends. Werewolves are associated with dense forests, but cannot be found in North America.

""The Wolf Man"" (1941) follows the legends. I wonder if this present 70-minute film was cut back from a longer running time? A ""talbot"" is a breed of dog. Are werewolves a type of serial killer? Some said these cyclical predations symbolized the economic cycles and the depression that plagued the world.

""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" (1942) is another example of a sequel that follows a successful movie. Lon Chaney Jr. continued as the werewolf while Bela Lugosi played the part of Frankenstein's Monster. There is a musical number for entertainment.

""She-Wolf of London"" (1946) is the runt of this litter. It is more psychological than scary, but worth watching once. Near the end there is a surprise, it is not what you were led to expect. Both June Lockhart and Don Porter starred in the television shows of the 1950s.

""Werewolf of London"" (1935) was the lesser known predecessor of the werewolf films. It is a dramatic story, like a morality play, that warns about human pride that leads to dangerous knowledge. The story about a dependency on a rare flower could symbolize addiction to a rare substance. It has a romantic triangle to add to the drama.",1488240000,,2147,4.903581267217631
