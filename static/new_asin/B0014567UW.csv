8254542,3,B0014567UW,"I was glad to see Kirby on this show for a while, but for some reason, the novelty faded. Kirby is a cute character and all, but the theme song is not that memorable, I was dissapointed that Kirby didn't talk, but these are not big problems. Tiff and Tuff are pretty cool companions and King DeeDeeDee is pretty funny in this show as well as his sidekick Escuargoon. They are an anime version of Prince John and Sir Hiss. It wasn't as adventurous as I hoped, but it's worth a watch once in a while. Although these episodes on this particular DVD are more kiddish.",1359331200,,563,4.320754716981132
8254543,5,B0014567UW,"As a mom and a veteran of the Pokemon, Sailor Moon, Inu Yasha, yadayada, explosions, this little pink guy remains my favorite. He's fun, adorable to watch, not too sugary but not too scary, and he teaches the lessons of friendship, courage, etc. Other reviewers are right - the animation is great in this DVD, very, very colorful and crisp, and I can't imagine a Kirby fan not being thrilled with it. Here are the specific episodes: ""Curio's Curious Discovery"", ""The Fofa Factor"", ""Hail To The Chief"", ""The Big Taste Test"", ""Escargoon Squad"", ""Cappy New Year"", and ""The Pillow Case"". One last thought - most of the Kirby plushes being offered on Amazon are absolutely superb in their quality to anything I've ever seen before, but do be careful of the maker/distributor, there's a couple of counterfeits sneaking in here and there. Hope this helps -",1289692800,9,849,4.821917808219178
8254544,4,B0014567UW,"My 8 and 4 yr old daughters love this DVD.  They have the Kirby DS game, and when they discovered Kirby had a movie out, they begged for it.  There are several different episodes on this DVD, and they are pretty humorous and suspenseful.  If your kids like the Pokemon series and already know who Kirby is, they will really enjoy this DVD.",1240963200,6,339,4.349206349206349
8254545,5,B0014567UW,This was great for my 6 year old son that discovered Kirby from another video game.  He loves Kirby and loves these cartoon movies.,1231459200,2,131,4.458333333333333
