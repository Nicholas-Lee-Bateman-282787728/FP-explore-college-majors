It is amazing to see in this video  that before the 1960's Los Angeles already had a rail trolley system to match any in the world.  From this film the viewer can see that the Los Angeles red car trolley was built on an amazing infrastructure of overhead tracks, underground tracks, subway tunnels, islands of tracks running in the middle and on the side of roads.  The visuals accompanied by a narrator show that the Los Angeles red car streetcar trolley system extended  to all areas of the Los Angeles area including to the far outer reaches of the suburbs and beyond connecting everyone to the central urban areas.  It was quite amazing!  Which leads me to ask the following question....what brain decided that it would be in everyone's interest to dismantle such a system already in place......a system that would cost billions to rebuild?  Now that Los Angeles is choking on its own vehicular traffic, one wonders how such a marvelous system depicted in this video could be dismantled?  Where was the pushback at the time of dismantlement?  The video (filmed in color) is spectacular in that it shows the Los Angeles  streetcar trolleys in action during the 1940's and 1950's.  It is amazing that someone had the foresight to film all of these trolley lines before they became extinct!",1497830400,,1347,4.783549783549783
