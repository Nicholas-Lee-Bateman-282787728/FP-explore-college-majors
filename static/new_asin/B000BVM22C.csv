Lots is covered: eco-conscious Oregon and Mt. Hood, coffee-loving Seattle and the fish-throwing in Pike Place Market, driving the coast with bikers and our likeable guide even climbs to the summit of Mt. St. Helens!

He spends time with Native Americans in La Push; attempts a number of the crazy local things, for instance, in the logging town of Hoquiam for the annual ""Logger's Playday"" he enters a log rolling competition, ax-throwing contest and other ""gotta do it once"" type of things.

My absolute favorite part is, once our guide is in Oregon, he hires a driver to fly/drive him through the famous sand dunes. The driver said that he sometimes reaches a speed of 60mph on the sand!

We'll be visiting the dunes in about one week, thanks to this program!",1156636800,2,896,4.616352201257862
8093125,4,B000BVM22C,"I purchased this dvd for my boyfriend who currently lives in Toronto.  He was coming out to visit me in Portland, Oregon, and had not been to the Pacific NW in more than 20 years.  I wanted him to get a preview of my part of the world so he could be prepared and know what he was getting into.  He is planning to relocate here next spring.

He watched the dvd and said he enjoyed it, but that there wasn't that much coverage of Portland.  He did find the Mount Hood raiload section alluring and memorable.",1155081600,2,505,4.164948453608248
