2486214,4,B000E3L7IC,"I agree with the other reviewers that this is not the best DVD documentary on the Great War (or the First World War.)  But I do think that this Documentary has its strengths.  For one, it gives a lot more war footage than the other two popular documentaries, and it is faster paced.  It covers (or at least mentions) most of the battles of the Great War.  It covers and  mentions more battles than the other two longer documentaries.  For major events, like the Archduke Ferdinand's assassination or the revolution in Russia, it spends less time on these subjects, but it covers all the basics on them.  The third DVD, in my opinion, is the best of the three DVDs.  Its documentaries on the air, sea, and land technologies of the war were well done, and the best part (in my opinion) of this purchase.

Yes, the narator is a bit dry, and he moves quickly, but if you want an overview of the Great War, this does cover all the basics.  There are maps, just as many as the other two documentaries, thus I don't understand some of the other reviews saying there are not maps.  The music and sound effects are not at the same level as the other two popular Great War documentaries, but the information given is equal to them.  There are not interviews with survivors or combatants of the war.  It is only the narrator that does the talking.  However, if you don't want 10-11 hours of documentary, but a 6 hour version that is quicker paced, and covers the war chronologically, than this is a good purchase.  The weakness of the documentary is that it doesn't tell much of the wars in Africa, in the East Africa German colony and the British South American colony.  Nor does it cover the Japanese and German naval battles in the Pacific.  But it does cover topics like the Battle of Jutland, and some of the air warfare, and at least mentions the Red Baron (Germany's best fighter, and the war's best pilot).  It covers the Eastern Front quite a bit, but more attention is given to the Western front.  It also seems to be SLIGHTLY more focused on the British view of the war.  It certainly doesn't focus on American involvement, but it covers the American involvement.  It covers the Zimmerman Telegram, the sinking of the Lusitania, etc. but it doesn't give too much attention to America that came into the war very late.  It is a bit dry at times, but most history buffs I know want good information, and this presents good information, fast paced, but not as ""exciting"" in presentation as the other two documentaries.",1176076800,7,2515,4.529933481152994
2486215,1,B000E3L7IC,"This has to be one of the worst documentaries ever written and edited. I say edited and not filmed because the original film footage used is excellent. It's biggest problem is it fast gets caught up in the horrors of the war and spends very little time on the history of the war. You almost get the feeling the producers and writers set about to do an anti war documentary and decided to use WW1 as a vehicle.

With all of the great WW1 documentaries out there don't waste your time or money on this one.",1167955200,5,504,4.25
2486216,1,B000E3L7IC,"While good footage of WWI may be rare, there is far more available than what this 6 and 1/2 hour documentary shows.  The first five episodes, of 8, deal with the war, one episode per year of the war.  There are about a dozen scenes that show up in almost every episode, with different dialogue over top of the visuals.  After a while it became so distracting, that all I was doing was counting how often these same scenes were repeated, in the different episodes.

They also did not match sound to the scene; for example you would see artillery being fired, yet machine guns are what you hear.

As for the chosen music, also very distracting, synthesized music which really was not appropriate to what was on the screen.

Finally, for insight into the why, how, what of the war, forget this series, because they do not even try to explain the reasons leading up to the war, what kept it running, and the disastrous effects that the end of the war and the treaties that were forced onto the German nation, spelled for the next couple of decades, up to and including the lead in to WWII.

I felt like the person above who felt like throwing the towel after the first episode, I really wish I would have done so.

Save your money, save your time, if you want a good series on the war, buy the BBC series called the First World War - superior in every aspect.

Another good series, although a dramatization, to explain the circumstances that led up to the war, is the BBC series Fall of Eagles.",1160956800,9,1490,4.389090909090909
2486217,4,B000E3L7IC,"Some of the above reviewers have panned this series for, among other things, being ""banal"" (i.e.  of presenting history as a mass of dates, numbers and place names, without commentary from historians and specialists who presumably, would bring a more penetrating and analytical perspective on the war).

While such reviewers are correct in some of their criticisms, it must be said that their assessments are not entirely fair.

The factors leading up to the war--the German challenge to British naval supremacy, the Germans' fear of ""encirclement"" by Russia, France, and Britain, the pent-up nationalist aspirations of the peoples of the Austo-Hungarian empire--were to my mind, quite clearly put across.  So too was the chain of events that were set in train by the assassination of the Archduke Francis Ferdinand by Gavrilo Princip (who was described as a Serbian ""terrorist""):  Austria Hungary used the assasination as a pretext to invade Serbia, an act which drew its ally, Russia, and Russia's ally, France, into war.

Interestingly, the series  gave due attention to Britain's initial vacillation at entering the war, vacillation which, the series noted, was put to a stop by the Germans' violation of Belgian neutrality.

While it is true that battles could have been portrayed more vividly, and that historians' views could have been put to good use, one of the series' chief strengths is that it  conveys, through (the sometimes admittedly tiresome) testimony of those who actually fought in the trenches, and through archival footage, the sheer horror and lunacy of that war.",1151366400,12,1586,5.237154150197629
2486218,2,B000E3L7IC,"This was a very disappointing series. It claims to be a complete history of WWI but it comes nowhere close. It seems to be put together solely for the purpose of showcasing archive footage from the war. The accompanying narrative is almost an afterthought. Little effort has gone into writing a narrative with any intent to inform, much less educate the casual viewer. It is split into 8 episodes, the first 5 chronicling one year of the war each, followed by 3 episodes dedicated to the technological aspects of the war; namely the air war, the sea war and the land war.

After the first episode, ""1914,"" which chronicles the start of the war, I was tempted to quit and give it a 1 star rating like the other reviewers here but fortunately it does improve over time, if only minimally. The entire series is made up of archival footage. There are no interviews with historians, experts or specialists. History is presented in the most banal way possible. If one could point to one way not to teach history, this would be it. History is not a recitation of names, dates and numbers. The ""world war"" shown here is confined solely to the European theatre and almost exclusively to the western front, possibly due to the lack of footage from elsewhere. There is absolutely no mention of the war in Africa, the Middle East or Asia aside from the Dardanelle's Campaign against the Ottoman Turks. And exactly why was the Dardanelle's Campaign fought at such great cost? The answer was to secure passage to the Black Sea and to open a second front in aid of the beleagured Russians but even that was not made clear. Instead we are inundated with numbers and lists as if we were cramming for some history test at the end - Regiment numbers, manpower numbers, detailed casualty lists, numbers ad nauseam.

We are given almost no idea about the reasons for the lead-up to the war other than the fact that Serbian ""nationalist"" Gavrilo Princip, assasinated the Archduke Ferdinand of Austria, triggering the network of pre-war treaties that culminated in war. Almost any schoolboy can tell you that. We are given the flip comment that the war could have been so ""easily avoided."" How? The first episode is the worst because of the see-sawing, almost static nature of the war and the need to fill up the silences between the footage of trench warfare. The first episode also highlights one of the major faults of this series, its failure to use proper maps to illustrate military movements. To paraphrase the old cliche, a map is worth a thousand words. To describe a single battle you'd need hundreds of words if not thousands. The same battle can be elegantly depicted on a single simple map. In the Battle of the Frontiers (1914), the script laboriously describes military movements at great length to little effect. Far from being enlightened, the viewer is left totally bewildered.

The narration can get so involved as to leave even the most seasoned viewer floundering.
I quote verbatim from part of the first episode:
""Joffre the French Commander in Chief was determined to win the war quickly. The offensive was supposed to be launched across the entire line from Nieuwport in Belgium to Verdun, thoughout the Artois and Champagne regions. In the event, the winter offensive was primarily directed against the German salient at Sambre which bulged into central France and a smaller salient that existed further south at St. Mihiel. Joffre's plan was to attack the German's 3rd Army with a numerically superior force at the Sambre salient at its northern and southern edges. A further attack in the Ardennes was to be launched to cut off the German's line of retreat.""

All fine on paper and with recourse to a map but can anyone honestly say that they can form a mental image of how the battle is being fought when this is rattled off by the narrator all within half a minute without a single useful map to show where all the places and forces are. A useful map is one with place-names and proper lines of movements for military forces, not a blank map with huge arrows covering half the continent and silly looking CGI explosions going off all over the place. I am no expert on the First World War. In the end I had to resort to taking down a book on the war and flipping to the battle maps to understand what the narrator was getting at. I ended up re-reading the book. Which was a lot more satisfying than watching this documentary.

Although it does use a lot of archive footage, the length of the series means that a lot of the footage is used repeatedly, some over half a dozen times. I especially remember the face of the German soldier who throws the same grenade from the first battle of the war to the last or the other poor German soldier who keeps getting shot in the chest repeatedly throughout the series.

Some care should also have been taken in proofing or final editing. In the final episode, mention is made of Kaiser Wilhelm II being the nephew of Britain's King George VII. The Kaiser was the nephew of Edward VII. There was no George VII. The last King George was George VI, the father of the present Queen.

All in all, not recommended. This documentary series is made by some company called ""Green Umbrella Sports and Leisure."" That in itself should have been a warning flag to stay away. If you must get a TV documentary on the First World War, Jonathan Lewis' ""The First World War - The Complete Series"" would be a good start.",1147824000,73,5447,4.638341968911917

2486220,1,B000E3L7IC,"The footage is interesting but the narration is so cursory and disjointed that it doesn't offer proper context for the photographs.  The maps and discussion of military dispositions are extremely inadequate.  This is one of the worst documentaries I have ever encountered.

2486221,5,B000E3L7IC,"There is not that much footage available from WWI, and this 6 hour+ UK produced set contains an extraordinary amount of it, along with great insights about what led up to the war-to-end-all-wars. Most importantly, it deals with these factors prior to U.S. involvement, and so the perspective is something different than a U.S. made doc would present.

Year-by-year, the program looks at the developing technology that  led to changes in how the war was fought. It additionally contains three chapters that address the military machines on LAND, in AIR and at SEA.

I had  chance to see this program in final production. It's truly well assembled and greatly informative. Nothing on the market rivals it.",1140393600,45,703,5.0344827586206895

8105176,1,B000E3L7IC,"This series might just be of help to high schoolers who know nothing about Europe or the war. To anyone who does know anything of the history, the programs are very superficial indeed. There is no reason to have individual discs for 45-minute episodes, the whole thing could easily fit on two DVDs. The narration is often obscured by irritating and unsuitable background music. These days there is no excuse for the poor quality (scratched and grainy) archive film used, or to have the old 'jerky' silent movie look when it is an easy matter to adjust the projection speed to see natural movement.",1460937600,,597,4.75

8105178,1,B000E3L7IC,"I was very disappointed with this series. There maybe heaps of footage, but we see it all again and again and again throughout. The images are often inappropriate to the action being described, and the sound mixing of audio commentary and background battlefield noise is often completely out of balance, making the commentary inaudible. Some interesting scenes, but the constant repetition diminishes their impact. I almost sent my boxed set back, I think you could do much better elsewhere.

8105180,1,B000E3L7IC,"I buy quite a few books and CDs and DVDs each year, but this is the first time that I have felt impelled to write a review. Anyone who has seen the excellent series on the Civil War by Ken Burns can't help but gag at this boring work on the First World War.  It is nothing but a chronological presentation of the battles, with the same film clips used over and over and over.  After seeing the same film clip used for the 6th or 7th time I got pretty tired and even irritated, and had to turn it off from pure boredom.  There are countless excellent photographs from that war.  Why were they not used rather than re-using the same film clips a dozen times?  One wonders what kept the makers of this documentary from using other sources (letters from the soldiers for example) rather than droning on about the rudimentary information on the battles?  I am sorry I paid money for these DVDs.",1238198400,5,889,4.325301204819277

A lot of the footage was new to me, not just the repeats that show up in program after program.  I also liked the additional 'histories' of land, sea and air technology.

Using historian interviews etc is sort of the Ken Burns approach to documentaries.  This is more like the classic CBS series.",1234224000,3,459,4.548780487804878

The main downsides of this series lie in the disorganized narration, a lack of context, minimalist maps, and a deeply annoying and repetitive (machine) gun noise effect.
