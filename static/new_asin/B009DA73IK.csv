5319481,3,B009DA73IK,"This movie kind of lost me for a while.  I don't have much to say about it but I did think the 3 main characters were pretty good, while the other crew.....not so much.  Camera work was a bit better on this than most and some pretty good jumps and screams the last portion of the film.  All in all, a solid 3, I just couldn't bring myself to go to a 4.",1383004800,,352,3.7945205479452055
5319482,2,B009DA73IK,"A group of documentarian's go into a haunted hospital and discover it really is haunted. Wow, it's the exact same story of Grave Encounters. Although I enjoyed this better than Grave Encounters, it still is one of those movies that could be a lot better if they would actually make a proper ending to the film instead of quickly getting it over and done with and hoping a sequel can be made.",1372809600,,391,4.444444444444445
5319483,3,B009DA73IK,"With the inundation of ""found footage"" films it's almost tempting to dismiss the entire genre as past its time... However, by doing so some may miss out on some interesting films. ""Reel Evil"" took the usual FF setting - an abandoned hospital/mental hospital - and gave it a slight twist (in this case, the filming of an actual movie). But lo and behold, the need to explore said hospital for a documentary was too much. Some slight scares. Not the worst of the genre, but neither the best.",1368057600,2,489,4.568181818181818
5319484,3,B009DA73IK,"This film is a new twist on old ""exploring the abandoned asylum for the criminally insane"" horror film. This one incorporates the found footage genre. In this production a film crew is hired to film a documentary on behind the scenes footage of a movie filmed at said asylum. What this gimmick does is to allow decent lighting as the main crew had set them up. This gives us a more professional looking found footage film.

Kennedy(Jessica Morris)leads this group of daring film makers as they explore the abandoned establishment. You see occasional ghosts on the camera, but initially there are fewer ghosts than appear on my camera. After our heroes have a tussle with the main quirky film's director, demanding producer, primadonna actress and they explore for a bit, you are one hour into a 72 minute feature before the first scare.

The film needed to be longer, cut out some of the build up, and extend the horror ending. I kept waiting for things to happen and when it did, it didn't show much and wasn't that scary.

5319485,1,B009DA73IK,"No matter how bad a movie may be, it's rare for me to quit watching...but REEL EVIL is so familiar, so poorly done and sooooo boring I couldn't make it through the first 60 minutes, almost falling asleep.
The acting is atrocious and the movie is almost exciting as watching paint dry.
REEL EVIL is further proof that the ""found footage"" genre has overstayed its welcome!!!",1360972800,4,372,4.651515151515151
5319486,2,B009DA73IK,"I love found footage films, specifically because the acting is so raw and realistic, and this one is no exception. Everyone (except the female playing the actress) was authentic, solid in their range, and did a great job of drawing you into the story, so the movie gets two stars for that. Unfortunately, that's where the positives of this film end. The plot has been done before, (and much better, might I add, by 'Grave Encounters'), and the special effects are atrocious. All of the apparitions looked to have been made using Microsoft Paint and then placed into the film with no regards to realism, or how it would appear to the average person. Considering that movies of this nature rely heavily on how well the SFX is implemented, I must say that I was very disappointed by what I saw. Lastly, there are too many instances where absolutely nothing happens, or the actors are walking around in (literal) circles, and this becomes tedious really fast.
The worst part of the film, however, is the gratuitous portrayal of breasts that seem to have been added to appease a mentality limited male audience. I counted 3 pairs of breasts, none integral to the story, and I actually rolled my eyes in annoyance at how the film-makers did not even attempt to hide the fact that they were sophomoric males whom have probably never seen a real naked female in their lives.
It's sad, really; the talent is obviously there, the story (albeit cliched) held my interest and the real-life location was creepy as hell. It was the execution that really suffered, as the movie was more frustrating to watch than enjoyable. Avoid this, and give your movie to the better films out there that follow a similar formula (Grave Encounters and The Tunnel come to mind).",1360108800,9,1748,4.7344262295081965
5319487,5,B009DA73IK,"Reel Evil is a film by director Danny Draven and writer Shane Bitterling. It tells the story of three aspiring filmmakers who land a gig shooting a behind the scenes documentary for a new film being shot in an abandoned insane asylum. Things go from bad, with the snobby Hollywood types that hired them, to worse when they discover they aren't the only ones in the asylum. Reel Evil is a found footage film style film with an edge. Full of atmosphere and creepy moments, what ""Paranormal Activity"" should have been.

The film starts by introducing us to the main characters as they have meeting with a ""big shot"" producer. Jessica Morris, Jeffery Alder, and Kaiwi Lyman do a fantastic job at building likeable characters. These are three people that you can relate to and pull for. Strong leads are something mandatory for a good horror film. Otherwise there is no tension because you don't care what happens to them. The rest of the cast is populated by snotty, rude, and arrogant Hollywood stereotypes. Before the horror even begins the viewer is already pulling for the three filmmakers to make it through this horrid shoot. Every actor in Reel Evil does a great job making this film believable and a joy to watch.

Though labeled as a found footage film Reel Evil differs from the rest of the flock. It has more of a cohesive linear flow as the film is told through the use of four cameras, two hand held and two stationary. This is not a ""Blair Witch"" vomit inducing shaky cam ride. The found footage from these four cameras is edited together and feels more like a traditional film or an episode of a ghost hunting show. Sometimes the hand held shots can get a bit dizzying, especially when things get more panicked, but this doesn't detract from the enjoyment in any way. In short, Reel Evil looks great and gives the viewer the feeling of being right there next to the filmmakers.

Filmed at the abandoned Linda Vista Hospital in Los Angeles, California, the location creates an atmosphere that makes it a star in itself. When the film stars arrive there is already a sense of foreboding. Once they meet the Hollywood film crew the tension starts to mount. We are in an uncomfortable environment and the protagonists are being treated horribly. This sets up an unsettling mood even before the supernatural occurrences. Once the three filmmakers break away and start exploring on their own the scares begin. They start subtly, which are some of the most effective. Strange sounds, shadows down the hall, doors closing by themselves. Simple tricks but they get the goose bumps going like no other. It gets almost claustrophobic when they get lost in the labyrinthine halls of the hospital. The scares build in intensity culminating in a heart pounding finale full of ghouls, gore, and got ya's.

Reel Evil is a great journey that any horror fan will enjoy. This film is wonderfully crafted with a strong cast. It's a ride that leaves you unsettled and glad to turn on the lights when it's over. It's also a ride that I look forward to taking again and again. This is a film made by people who love and understand the genre. Reel Evil sticks with you and makes you believe that there is real evil out there.

5319488,1,B009DA73IK,"Why do I do keep doing this to myself? I had no idea it was ""found footage"" until the very opening and it was, thereafter, all downhill. Uphill, really, as it was such an effort to keep my eyes open. This effort is peopled with cartoonishly nauseating individuals that you couldn't really care less about and, as far the tart leading the documentary crew into ever more contrived situations goes...better she had stayed home. Better for her career, that is.
Awful, awful, awful dross that should be left on the shelf. Derivative and unrelentingly bad. Avoid it.",1359590400,2,561,4.793814432989691
5319489,5,B009DA73IK,"I've said this before and I'll say it again:  I never get tired of the found-footage horror sub-genre.  Granted, I've seen some stinkers over the years, but for the most part the found-footage category has treated me fairly well.  Full Moon's recent venture into this reinvigorated area is REEL EVIL, a nice little fright-flick that is well done and serves up the scares by the bucketful.

This film impresses me on several levels.  It looks good overall, the acting is top notch, the special effects rock, and even the gore is impressive.  In short, it is a very entertaining thrill ride.

Probably the most excellent aspect of REEL EVIL are the scares.  I actually jumped a couple of times when creepy things happened in unexpected places.  The film does a great job of setting up what you think will be a scare...but then nothing happens; and then, when your guard is down later on, something happens that surprises you and makes you spill your popcorn.  THIS is a great example of how a horror movie is supposed to make you feel.

The special effects are nice as well, with lots of creepy and disturbing imagery.  Some of the elements involved with the ghosts are probably done by CG, but you would never know that by looking at them onscreen; they are seamlessly integrated into the picture and look amazing.

REEL EVIL is not perfect however; my sole and biggest complaint about the film is the lack of explanation as to why these events are happening.  There are several things I have to assume, but even they don't fully explain what's going on.  Big spoiler here, but I also question what the tentacled `things' were that were pulling the victims into doorways and what-not?

I'm probably looking too deeply into the film and I should just enjoy it for what it is:  a first-rate fright-fest that delivers the goods.  I give REEL EVIL and thumbs up and recommend checking it out.  It's best to watch at night, in the dark, with the surround-sound cranked up for the full experience.  But however you watch it, give it a look for sure.",1355443200,6,2042,4.635097493036212
5319490,5,B009DA73IK,A good horror film that has you believing the fear felt by the main characters. The asylum setting makes for a high creepiness factor.  Plenty of DVD extras make it even better. Lots of fun!,1354752000,3,190,4.428571428571429

5319499,3,B009DA73IK,"If you've seen Grave Encounters (you must have) and Greystone Park (enjoyable though much criticized for being similar to GE), then you know this movie already. Now, I am NOT one of those critical snobs who will poo poo a movie because its thematic content is not wholly original. If that was a problem for me, then most of my slasher A list films, nevermind B list, would not have been made. Actually, that would be true of any subgenre, slasher or otherwise. So I am VERY grateful to those many movies that do not strive for originality but effectiveness because, thanks to them, I have stuff to watch.

I guess what makes it hard to overlook the derivative quality here is the main characters. The secondary characters, those who our protags were going to record for their ""making of..."" documentary, were obnoxious on purpose and as such, funny and a breath of fresh air from the ""Controlling Dumb Beotch, with the Dumb and Dumber follower"" trio that comprised our protags. Seriously, this not being my first rodeo, if I were in a situation like this, with anyone who acted like that, I would be the first one to satisfy their death wish, waaay before the ghost, demon, serial killer, et al, would get a chance to. You are NOT going to take me down with your dumb butt. That being said... I don't normally criticize the ""stupid decisions"" made by many of our protags in these movies- and it irks me when others do- because, duh, if they didn't make those mistakes then there would be no movie! But these guys were just too annoying. So much so, I was glad when Dr. Evil came to visit. Except they were biref visitations and as such, didn't comprise much or enough of the film. The visuals, the horror effects, were fine actually. But having seen the aforementioned same but first movies, it wasn't enough to excite me. Pretty much a forgettable experience. Definitely not for primetime viewing. But if you have absolutely nothing else to watch, its not the bottom of the barrel.",1392422400,,1982,4.614730878186969
5319500,4,B009DA73IK,"I know this movie was attacked but the positive things people have said are true. They do go around in circles at some point but not by choice. The best way to watch a found footage film is in the dark and with no expectations. Remember in theory it's real life not a movie. I like that they go exploring in the spooky building it kind of builds the tension. I did think the sound guy was kind of a wuss.

8540203,1,B009DA73IK,"This ""found footage"" film stinks pretty much from the beginning. It shows NO real TALENT  from any of the actors. It has a ragged story written by someone who has had to much to drink, and not enough time to sleep it off. Whiny people portraying their roles like a baker handling a pan from the oven with no mitt. Scenes that shows off someones miniscule abilities from Photoshop. Attempts at portraying ethereal beings in this insane asylum are jerky, choppy, and one will notice that whenever a ""ghost"" shows up, the film goes blurry, choppy, and jumpy. Are we to believe that when an apparition passes by, they are to NOTICE a camera mounted on the wall?...And pander to the camera, like they would to flesh and blood?
No...totally unbelievable. Totally asinine, total garbage, and Amazon should be ashamed for selling this.

8540205,2,B009DA73IK,"The story for Reel Evil is pretty cut and dry. A standard tale of haunting where the spirits are far from friendly. The film uses all the expected tricks of found-footage that has come to define the sub-genre so there is nothing new within that aspect of the movie. The effects are a blend of traditional organic effects combined with the more modern CGI produced material. In this film the director took care not to over use the computer generated effects so that what is used is tolerable. When it came to the gorier organic effects there was just as much care taken and it provides expected realism to those necessary moments. The story is a good story which is entertaining and convincing. It doesn't seem contrived or forced upon us.  The actors are pretty tight in their performances and give a believable performance as well which makes the movie watchable.

Reel Evil could have been one of those opportunities for the studio to shine but unfortunately as a horror story the movie fails. The director seems to have forgot the main ingredient-the thrills. There are absolutely no moments in this film that are scary or suspenseful at all. It is a pretty standard ghost story that tells a great tale but beyond the standard cookie cutter pattern of story telling there is nothing that stands out about Reel Evil. Watch knowing it will be a cool ghost story from a staple studio in the horror genre but don't expect to be scared or have those intense moments of suspense because they are just not in this movie.",1433462400,,1516,4.652985074626866
