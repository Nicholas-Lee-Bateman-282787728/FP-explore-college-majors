5553371,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Been working out for thirty years at home and at a gym. This dvd contains four 20 minute workouts that are fun to do, but make you work. Jessica Smith does an excellent job of cuing. Beautiful setting. I have over 40 dvd workouts and this is in the top 3. Arrived on time. Glad I made the purchase!",1364169600,5,298,4.067796610169491
5553372,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Jessica Smith has put thought to every aspect of this DVD....and it shows with the exceptional scenery, production, variety of moves and her lovely way of motivating you. I Love it. Those of you have done her utube videos....this has new innovative moves.",1364083200,2,255,4.953488372093023
5553373,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Jessica has rapidly become my go-to girl for when I want to work out but not feel WORKED OUT. I have more than my fair share of HIIT and plyo workout DVDs and, well, some days you need to take a step back, honor the body, and just be kind and gentle to yourself. And that's where this DVD comes in.

Now, that's not to say you won't get a good workout with this DVD. The beautiful thing is all the routines clock in around 20 minutes (some are a minute or so shorter while others are a minute or two longer) and you can mix and match if you want to. Only have time for 1 routine? Not a problem! You will still get an excellent workout. My heart rate got up on the 2 cardio routines and the 1 sculpt routine and I even broke a little bit of a sweat, too! I'm by no means out of shape as I've been exercising consistently for years but these are sneaky little workouts! They are deceptively easy looking but pack a punch without feeling like you've been run over by a big rig.

The hands down best routine on this DVD (in my opinion) is Core Stretch. While the whole DVD is set outside (save for Cardio Dance), Core Stretch felt particularly zen like and was simultaneously relaxing while also providing a much needed de-kink of my body and giving my abs something different from their usual Pilates for a change. The music is fantastic and just added to that overall feeling of being at a spa...All while burning out my obliques.

Very little space is needed so apartment dwellers (like me) can rejoice! Plus, there's little to no impact so if you're on the top floor you needn't worry that your downstairs neighbors will think a herd of elephants is about to bust through their ceiling. As far as equipment goes all you need is a mat, a sturdy chair, and some dumbbells. As previously stated, the location is quite pretty and for those of us stuck in snowy states, be prepared to get some major Fresh Air and Vitamin D envy.

And Jessica is an absolute doll! It will feel like you're working out with a friend and not some scary drill sergeant trainer. She knows right when to cue, right when to remind you of form, and right when to encourage. During the Cardio Flow routine, my neck was getting all out of alignment during one of the moves because I was too busy trying to follow along with what they were doing on the TV screen when Jessica gently reminded us (well, me, in this case) to look down to the floor so as to keep our necks in alignment -- she would tell us when this move was over. And she kept her word!

For me, this DVD hits all the high points. I hope it does the same for you!",1363737600,51,2596,4.2152917505030185
5553374,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I love to exercise!  It's one of my favorite past times as it has benefits in so many ways. However, the current trend of more HIIT, harder, faster, pound...has gotten old for me. Enter Jessica Smith's Total Body Balance DVD. The DVD is a complete system covering cardio, cardio and sculpt, sculpt, and core/stretch. All workouts can be done barefoot and make you feel GREAT without beating you up. The music is wonderful, Jessica's comments and cues are spot on, and there is a great background exerciser to show more challenging modifications.

If you are looking for a workout DVD that gives results without leaving you sore and exhausted, try this one. And, try Jessica's You Tube channel for lots of free workouts she makes for us. She is truly a gem and so is this workout.",1363478400,35,779,4.678832116788321
5553375,5,B00B2TWDWG,I am in love with Jessica's workouts.  This DVD is a great addition to my workout library.  The cardio sections are fun and effective and the toning sections are deceptively challenging yet doable.  I look forward to working out with Jessica and see myself using this DVD a lot.,1362873600,,278,4.63265306122449
5553376,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I really enjoy this set of workouts.  They are creative and fun, with no dread factor!  I really like that they are in 20 minute increments so I can fit them in when I have a little time or combine them with other workouts!",1362614400,,223,4.045454545454546
5553377,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Love stringing the first three workouts on this one together (cardio flow, sole sculpt, and core stretch). I also love doing the core stretch by itself on nights I have scheduled to stretch (in b/w HIIT and strength training days). Lately I have found a new love for dance based routines to sculpt and LOVE the cardio dance sculpt routine!

What I Love about all of Jessica Smith's videos is the instruction, cues and motivation (all while saying YES we should push and challenge ourselves BUT we also need to listen to our bodies to not over do it.....so I don't feel pressure to have to keep up if I really  can't).",1362268800,,617,4.5
5553378,5,B00B2TWDWG,"This DVD has 4 sections, all 20 minutes long. Cardio Flow, Sole Sculpt, Core Strength and Cardio Dance Sculpt. Enjoyed all 4 chapters. Easy to follow, moderations available for a bit more of a harder workout. Loved the setting, its easy to follow and enjoyable for all ages. Even though I did this in one go its easy to break up throughout the day or 20 minutes here and there as your time allows. You can also use these as add on's to other workouts. Highly recommend.",1361836800,4,469,4.402298850574713
5553379,5,B00B2TWDWG,"As an avid, and routine fitness junkie, I have been desperately anticipating Jessica's two new DVDs, this particular title, and her Walking for Weight Loss DVD.  I started my fitness and weight loss journey roughly 4 years ago, with a Jessica Smith DVD (Women's Health ""Train for your Body Type""), and have since lost 35 lbs, countless inches, battled and overcome SEVERE depression, and developed a lifelong love of fitness.

Being well educated in Jessica's style and form, I expected this particular title ""Total Body Balance"" would be a breeze for me.  I thought wrong.  This DVD combines over an hour of low impact, cardiovascular work, high repetition low weight strength, and 360 degree core strengthening that had my gasping for air, yet feeling delightfully relaxed, more centered, and well-worked. In addition, the WHOLE DVD is done barefoot and feels great!  The music is upbeat, and full of variety.  Recall any of those workouts with the same boring ""elevator music"" over and over again?  Not this DVD.  The setting is beautiful, lots of fresh, open air, trees swaying in the breeze, and open water and sunshine.  Certainly enough to make me want to move!!  Especially during this cold Iowa winter.

Jessica, and her fellow workout partner on this DVD provide a well rounded variety of different options for all workout levels, regardless of cardio, strength or flexibility limitations.  Overall, this DVD provides all one needs to begin on their fitness journey, or add some much needed variety to the gamut of other workout choices available on the market today.  I firmly believe this DVD could in and of itself, be a complete routine for someone just starting, and certainly makes an excellent choice for someone looking to add a little less rigor to an already established routine.  As mentioned before, I am an avid fitness junkie, and have developed decent strength and stamina from other workout programs over the years, yet still found this workout challenging and effective but didn't feel wiped out at the end.

There is not enough praise in the world for Jessica and her commitment to fitness and helping others lead healthier, active lives.  Her pleasant attitude and infectious smile make it hard to not smile back, even through that good ""burn"" of working hard through this DVD.  Jessica's commitment to helping others is evident through her YouTube channel (JessicaSmithTV) where she frequently posts new AND FREE, full length workout routines without as she clear states ""any obligation to buy anything from her EVER"".  She frequents and responds to her followers via her Facebook and Twitter feeds (10 Pounds Down) and provides helpful tips, support and friendly advice and support for viewers near and far.

I am proud to support Jessica Smith (I have every single workout she has ever put out on DVD), and would recommend her highly to anyone just starting out on their fitness journey, or someone who is looking for something new, or to add to an already established routine.",1361664000,57,3009,5.006024096385542
5553380,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Not only does Jessica have a gift when it comes to creating fun and feel good workouts, she is gifting us on youtube.  These dvds are wonderful because they take Jessica's creativity to a beautiful location.  I have gotten so used to to moving with Jessica that I am finding it harder to workout with any other instructor.
Total Body Balance has something for everyone. The Cardio Flow chapter is delightful and may be my favorite but in fairness, I haven't gotten to Cardio Dance Sculpt yet because of DOMS from Sole Sculpt which looked so deceivingly simple.",1361491200,4,560,4.704081632653061
5553419,5,B00B2TWDWG,Love the barefoot cardio workout.  Jessica is such a positive and encouraging trainer.,1515974400,,86,5.615384615384615

5553421,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Smooth flowing and fun workout.  The filming is nice, and the prompts are excellent.  Really enjoy her workouts because they are easy to follow and there are always different levels so just about any level exerciser is made welcome.",1504224000,,232,4.923076923076923
5553422,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I really enjoy doing this DVD. Whenever possible I like to workout barefoot so this DVD is perfect for me. I like the energy of the cardio flow section. It gets my heart rate up to a decent rate and I feel energized for the rest of my day. The sole sculpt was fun to do. It's not like most strength workouts and I like that. I have plenty of DVDs with the traditional workouts that use weights, so I liked that this one was done barefoot and with light weights. To me it has a nice, flowing vibe to it that made the time go by quickly. The core stretch is done mostly on the floor and I like the unique moves that Jessica always seems to have for abs. I felt that it was pretty effective and it's my favorite workout on the DVD. Cardio Dance Sculpt is just fun to do in my opinion. You use a chair for part of the routine and the time goes by quickly. Jessica's upbeat personality makes her workouts fun to do and I'm always surprised at how quickly the time goes. I've had workouts where I was constantly wondering how much longer until the end and I never feel like that when I do this DVD.",1496793600,4,1092,4.060185185185185
5553423,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Complete, low impact and you sweat! Jessica encourages without badgering. Love her fitness workouts!",1496102400,,100,6.214285714285714
5553424,5,B00B2TWDWG,Love this DVD!  Popped in yesterday and was pleasantly surprised at the flow and movement.  This DVD took the top spot in our yoga section!,1495584000,,139,4.52

5553426,5,B00B2TWDWG,"This is one of my favorite workout DVD from Jessica Smith.  I love Cardio Flow.
It is truly a feel good workout with no dread factor.  Cardio Dance Sculpt
is fun.  I haven't tried Core Stretch or Sole Sculpt yet.  I sure they want disappoint.
I am loving all of her workouts that I have tried so far.",1487030400,4,300,4.120689655172414
5553427,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I really like this workout video!  There are four 20 minute circuits, all done barefoot.

Cardio Flow - the description is perfect, it's a smooth, flowing 20 circuit.  There are a lot of squats and some unique arm movements.
Sole Sculpt - another smooth workout, this one uses hand weights for some moves, so this is especially good for the arms.  Some of this circuit seems inspired by barre movements.
Core Stretch - just a stretching circuit, I find it strange that this isn't the last circuit, but you can choose the order of the circuits if you pick one at a time instead of ""play all.""
Cardio Dance Sculpt - this is, of course, a dance circuit.  I am not graceful at all, so I like to try some dance workouts to try and help with that, or at least challenge myself in that way.  It's not overly complicated so even an awkward person like myself can get through this.

I also really love the instructor, Jessica Smith.  Her attitude/personality is the best and her moves are fun, unique, and often inspired by workouts like barre, ballet, or pilates.",1482364800,24,1055,4.515789473684211

5553431,5,B00B2TWDWG,You can't beat a Jessica Smith video. I like that these are just 20 minute videos. I can do them at the end of the day to unwind. Her videos are so easy to follow and she is so encouraging.,1472256000,,189,3.75
5553432,3,B00B2TWDWG,"I love Jessica Smith's workouts, but this one is just so so. I can't really put my finger on why, but I'm not really enjoying it, It's kind of boring. I love the Walk Strong: 6 Week Total Transformation System though. That's the only other one of hers that I have.",1471564800,,264,4.196078431372549
5553433,5,B00B2TWDWG,I am a huge fan of Jessica. I am currently doing her new Summer of Strength program but saw this (even though it is older). What I like about it is everything can be done barefoot. I have done the cardio dance sculpt and broke out in a sweat. I am going to add these workouts to the Summer of Strength workouts. Thanks Jessica!,1469059200,,327,4.125
5553434,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Wow! This is a very very challenging DVD. Granted, I'm 57 and want to give everything my all, but these ""short"" workouts really get the sweat going. I recommend this for those who want to get a good workout in a shorter amount of time. The core stretch is really a tough abs workout : )",1468800000,4,286,4.125
5553435,3,B00B2TWDWG,Jessica is pleasant and easy to follow but its just another workout tape and I have many I like.  There is no definite cool down segment but you can go to a segment near the end and follow that.  Its good to mix up your other routines and feel toned everywhere.,1467936000,2,261,4.098039215686274

5553471,4,B00B2TWDWG,"This is the first of two DVD's I have purchased by Jessica Smith.
Pros:  I really enjoy Jessica's teaching style.  I like that she praises you for joining her to work out and doesn't scream at you that you aren't doing enough.  I enjoy the movements.  Many are original and unique.  She keeps the arms moving which helps with toning and caloire burn, and boy does it burn!
Cons:  My DVD is quite blurry as if it has been dubbed a few to many times.  This is why I deducted one star.  I wish there was a countdown timer.  Next time I'll use my own timer.
Recommended if you want a nice workout where you won't question if you might die before it ends. :)",1464825600,4,653,4.16
5553472,5,B00B2TWDWG,"These are short workouts but boy, do you work!  I bought this DVD as part of the Phase II Six Weeks Transformation schedule, and also thought each segment would be a quick mile workout on days I don't have much time.  Jessica doesn't let you slow down at all; you definitely can't daydream as you go through the workout.  The first time I did the cardio abs - wow! - and I've been doing walking based workouts for a long time.  I prefer the DVDs with Jessica, her mom and Beth just because I can see three different levels of workout but this one is good for a little variety.",1462752000,2,576,4.209090909090909

5553474,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I love this DVD. I bought it about a year ago and it was included in The Ultimate Workouts for Weight Loss 4-DVD Collection.  It is one of my favorites. Jessica, please do more balance DVDs. The package also had a Barre Fitness DVD, which I'd also love to see more of. Thank you so much Jessica!  You are my absolute favorite.",1460764800,,326,4.241935483870968
5553475,5,B00B2TWDWG,This DVD is no joke.  The workouts are divided into 20 minute segments so I figured I'd have to do two to really feel worked out but each routine feels complete on its own.  A little light on warm ups and cool downs but not light on the work...but it is feel good work.,1458345600,2,269,3.962962962962963
5553476,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I bought this DVD and the Yoga stretch DVD as suggested by Jessica to mix in with her Walk Strong 6 week total transformation program.  The music in this program is fabulous!  Especially the first tune on the cardio flow workout, that piano, love it!  The workouts are great too, of course.  The cardio dance sculpt is my fave right now.  Jessica's workouts never disappoint me.",1458086400,2,378,4.666666666666667
5553477,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I enjoy fusion workouts that are easy on the joints, yet very challenging. This dvd is one of the best in that category.

5553478,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this DVD. I found this gem after I started doings Jess's walking DVDs. It was a nice departure from walking. My favorite is the cardio flow. The music is amazing & energizing and the workout is easy to follow along with, but can be intense depending on how you push yourself. Sole sculpt left me sore for days even using only 3 lb weights!! Who knew?  Cardio sculpt was really fun and effective as well. I did not care much for core stretch, but I am not that into yoga / stretching as much as the workout based routines. If you love Jess's barefoot fusion sculpt on her 6 week program, you must treat yourself to this one! I hope you will love it too!",1456876800,4,669,4.186046511627907

THIS DVD is a joy to do.  I get to go barefoot!  I can do Cardio Flow for 20 minutes or the ""Sole Sculpt""  workout for 20 minutes which is constantly moving, works everything and is low impact and you can use lightweight dumbbells if you want.  My favorite is the Core Stretch 20 minute routine - WOW!  I feel great and can fit this in almost any day.  The last is Cardio Dance using a chair - fairly simple - even I can do it.
I highly recommend this DVD and hope it is produced again in future so others can buy.  I noticed it is only available used but so worth it.",1451001600,3,707,4.072463768115942

5553483,4,B00B2TWDWG,"I did each of the four workouts contained on this DVD separately, so I will review them that way.

Total Body Balance  Sole Sculpt
Led by Jessica Smith, this was a little more than I was looking for this morning as far as squats and lunges go for some reason I thought feet would be more involved. Looking back I realize how ridiculous that sounds. In general I loved this. Lots of plies and squat variations all combined with arm movements. It felt very graceful, and the four limb movements always make me sweat even when it doesnt seem that strenuous on the face.
Total Body Balance  Core Stretch
Now this was an ab workout I could get behind. If you know me at all you know I hate ab workouts, for two reasons 1) Im lazy and my abs are week, 2) So much lying around I get bored. Logically throughout, I knew I was working the core with most of these moves, but she went about it in such a sneaky way that I didn't get bored at all and then it was over. Totally awesome.
Total Body Balance - Cardio Flow
This had a distinctly different feel than her walking workouts but was super enjoyable and didn't require shoes which makes it a winner in my book.
Total Body Balance - Cardio Dance
Again another fun cardio style dance workout. Different than her dance walks but just as much fun.
Typically I enjoy Jessica's walking workouts, but this was worth having in the back pocket because it is still all the things about Jessica's workouts I enjoy and the added benefits of strength workouts.",1426204800,2,1491,4.375451263537906
5553484,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I love this fitness DVD. It has so much variety, but the moves are more my style. I am into the whole ballet, yoga, pilates and dance fusion workouts that incorporates aspects of each type of workout into one session. I truly feel like I am getting a good cardio workout with moves that are more geared towards developing a slim, toned, and feminine physique.... I am so happy with this purchase. I have A LOT of fitness DVDs and this is up there within my top 5. I've been doing this DVD at least once or twice a week which says a lot for someone who has over 100 exercise videos.",1424390400,2,581,4.196428571428571
5553485,5,B00B2TWDWG,"These are the perfect workouts to do on an active recovery day.  It gets your body moving and gently stretches you out.  Jessica really shines with these types of workouts.

Jessica workouts with one background exerciser, Asha.  I love watching Asha because of her energy and her smile.  She really looks like she is enjoying the workouts.  I can't help but smile when I watch her.

This DVD has 4 workouts:

*Cardio Flow (20 minutes) - Jessica and Asha are in pretty light green tops, with black tights.  You are working out barefoot.  All of the moves in this routine include some sort of flowing arms.  I feel so graceful when I do this workout.  How I actually look is another story.  Some of the moves in this workout include:  tap toes and sweep single arm up, skater flow, rocking horse, cross over 123 with ballroom arms, narrow squat with tap back and one arm backstroke.

*Sole Sculpt (20 minutes) -Jessica and Asha are in pretty coral colored tops and black tights.  You use light weights for this; Jessica recommends 3 or 5 pounds.  I found that 3 pounds was plenty heavy!  Some of the moves in this routine include:  back fly with triceps push back, plie with arms scooping front, plie with arms in a `W,' lying face down and using arms and legs to make an `X' shape, bicycle.

*Core Stretch (20 minutes) - Jessica and Asha are in purple tops.  How cool is it to work your abs and getting a great stretch at the same time?  My only comment about this workout is that I wish it was the last one on the DVD since it is the most calming and slow moving of all the routines so I tend to do this one last.

* Cardio Dance Sculpt (20 minutes) - Jessica and Asha wear turquoise tops in this routine.  They are working out inside, with a large picture window overlooking a gorgeous and inviting pool.  The music is funky and really fits the energy of the workout.  All you need for this workout is a chair.  Some of the steps in this routine include:  v step with upper body twist, side step while moving up and down and pushing arm up, plie squat switching between first and second positions, crescent knee, triceps dips on chair, hands on chair, leg extend back and lift, crunch leg to elbow, flash dance move - lean back and kick legs, disco pointer finger.  This is most definitely a fun and feel good workout.  You won't even think of it as exercise!

If you are looking for some fun routines that will get you up and moving and that have no dread factor, then this DVD is most certainly for you!",1424044800,,2506,4.359307359307359

This DVD needs a place in your collection, it is customizable, challenging, and just like everything Jessica Smith puts out there....fun. I used to be someone who felt that if I wasn't near death at the end of a workout, it wasn't worth doing, and then I self educated, realized that just isn't the case, and have since found a winner in Jessica Smith...in short, it's fun, as exercise should be!",1405296000,4,461,4.566265060240964
5553500,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Great DVD--I am overweight and have finally made the decision that I had to get healthy as I am getting older.  This DVD is fun to do, and afterwards you are very relaxed--there are plenty of stretches which I think are good for beginners or those returning to working out, makes your muscles feel great.",1404345600,5,304,4.527272727272727
5553501,4,B00B2TWDWG,"I'm not a fan of barefoot workouts as it hurts my feet a little but these 20 minute workouts are definitely great workouts - I would suggest wearing shoes.  Even though it was 20 minutes, I could not believe how I looked when I was done - I had sweat dripping down my face and chest - it was amazing. I really like Jessica and how she explains each walk.  I only gave this 4 star rating because of the suggested barefoot walks but if I wear shoes then it gets 5 stars!",1399852800,3,468,4.021505376344086
5553502,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I've been working out for over 20 years and this by far is the most enjoyable and effective DVD I own (and I own over 100!). I am so happy that Jessica is making workouts for all intensity levels. I highly recommend all four workouts on this DVD, either alone or in combination (about 80 minutes). Thank you, Jessica! Please keep making workouts like this!",1398297600,2,356,4.492307692307692
5553503,5,B00B2TWDWG,There are many other reviews that go into the details of the DVD so I'll skip that...I excercise 5-6 days per week with a heart rate monitor and I can knock out 650-700 calories in 65 minutes on 3 of these sections (minus the stretch section).  I feel great and not overwhelmed or tired; I still have energy to do things the rest of the day.  I also love Ellen Barret but sometimes she's just a little to slow...I love Jessica as she puts the barefoot fussion to the max for the days I really want to get my heart pumping without dreading the work out.  Thank you Jessica!! XOXO,1394409600,5,578,4.236363636363636
5553504,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I've been doing Jessica Smith's YouTube videos and jessicasmithtv.com's challenges for about five months now and decided it was time to try a DVD (this and 10 Pounds Down Better Body Blast).  I was not disappointed!  While some of her online videos were much more difficult I thought this DVD was a solid series of workouts that weren't hard on the joints but still made me sweat.  With four separate 20 minute segments it makes it easy to mix and match depending on what type of exercise you're looking for.

Cardio Flow: I was surprised that this had me sweating as much as it did because it was very low impact and done with minimal space and movements that weren't difficult (she does offer options to make things tougher).  I enjoyed it because I'm not a fan of HIIT or anything that incorporates jumping, jogging, etc.  It may not be as intense but it still got the heart pumping!

Sole Sculpt: I did this with 5 pound weights and thought it was effective but not too challenging (we'll if I feel the same tomorrow morning!).  She targets most areas but I wish there had been more work done on the biceps; most seemed to focus on the back muscles and triceps.  If you're looking for more of a dumbbell workout she has a lot on her website to choose from.  However, on days where you just don't have the energy this is a good option.

Core stretch:  I really enjoyed this segment as it was both relaxing and I did feel it in my core.  I've always liked standing or yoga inspired abdominal routines and while this didn't include standing there were many unique moves.  Looks easier than it actually was as I had a modify a few to get through them!

Cardio dance sculpt:  This one was really good for the legs as it was very ballet inspired.  Once again low impact but I found myself sweating despite that.  The arms didn't get quite as good of a workout but I am used to using weights.

The main draw of the DVD is Jessica.  She is absolute delight, unlike drill sergeant instructors (Jillian Michaels, I'm talking to you).  She's sweet and encouraging, doesn't annoy you with mindless chit chat and is feeling the burn along with you.  The music fit perfectly for each routine and the scenery was lovely but not distracting.  While not as difficult as Better Body Blast, which has more intense cardio bursts, this DVD did what it should: got the blood pumping, was easy on the joints and gave me a well rounded workout.  I did all the routines in one shot but depending on your mood or level of soreness you can just do or two one if you're short on time.  Highly recommend and am looking forward to Jessica's two new DVDs that will be released soon!",1388620800,8,2655,4.43595041322314

5553506,5,B00B2TWDWG,"I love working out with this DVD. Moves are easy to follow, you get a hold of it after 3 work outs. Music is one of the best compared to others. It doesn't bother you in the background :) I recommend it if you are an intermediate level. It might be easy  if you are an advanced level and might be intimidating for beginners but it's always good to push yourself.",1385769600,3,362,4.098591549295775
5553507,5,B00B2TWDWG,"Just received my first Jessica Smith DVD yesterday & worked out with it today.

DVD consists of four workouts approximately 20 minutes in length = Cardio Flow, Sole Sculpt, Core Stretch and Cardio Dance Sculpt. I managed all but Core Stretch today.

When reviewing the DVD yesterday, the workouts looked easy but boy did they work up a sweat. I thought the indoor setting for Cardio Dance Sculpt would annoy me when working out what with the light coming through the window behind Jessica being very bright at times. But I really did not notice it while I was working out today. I was too busy concentrating on the moves, and being a non dancer, I was busy thinking: I'll bet I look like the Tin Man while doing these dance moves because I sure feel like him! :-\

Jessica has a lovely, gentle & encouraging personality. She's AMAZING at cueing her next move - Jessica and her workouts on this DVD remind me of Ellen Barret but on x2 fast forward! Still very easy to follow thanks to her AMAZING cueing. Did I mention she's amazing at cueing? hahahaha - I just really appreciate that after working out with instructors who expect you to be psychic about their next move - so frustrating! No frustration here. And no strained neck from turning it to see what she's doing next. She even tells us a few times not to look at her because we know the move and she'll let us know when it's time to change. Such consideration and care for her viewer.  Really really glad I bought the DVD even though it's pricier than what I would normally pay for workout DVDs on Amazon - but hey - still cheaper than regular live classes of any sort and if I love a DVD the regular use will make it worth it.

This DVD and all of EB's are really about honouring the body. Not killing yourself to get fit/toned. Not sure what Jessica's other DVDs would be like though.

Five stars for the DVD and A+++ for the instructor - Thank you Jessica Smith!!",1381276800,10,1924,4.390449438202247
5553508,5,B00B2TWDWG,I love the fact that each workout is only 20 mins yet you feel like you got a great workout in. I can do most of this with some modifications and I am 28 weeks pregnant. I love the fact that its bare foot and that Jessica does the easier workout but you can follow the other girl to take it up a notch.,1377648000,3,302,3.734375
5553529,3,B00B2TWDWG,"It is a bit too dancy for me.  I am far from a ballerina and I felt that some of the moves were for those who had more flexibility and could dance!  Sure, there were sections with plenty of squats, but lots of plies too ---- lots....  I prefer her cardio kickboxing workouts.",1375142400,10,275,4.150943396226415

Now that I've actually done the workout, this 50 yr old out of shape lady is impressed!  The workout is good, nothing real strenuous but you'll definitely get a sweat going & burn some calories.
I love the instructor, she has such a calm & mellow voice and she doesn't over talk it...no babbling, just clear instructions and encouragement.
I'll be using this video several mornings each week and am looking at some if her other workout videos.",1372291200,5,540,4.614583333333333

I find Jessica incorporates everything I like in a workout, strength, flexibility and cardio, while making exercise fun on top of it!  You have the option of a 20 minute workout or you can do all at once.  I never thought a 20 minute workout would get my heartrate up, but it sure does and really energizes you.  The dance moves in some of the workouts are very easy to follow and Jessica gives you options to step it up or keep it low impact.  Jessica is one of my favorite workout instructors. She really emphasises on proper form and technique and keeps you motivaded!  The scenery was beautiful and not distracting for me at all.",1370736000,3,715,4.371212121212121

5553535,3,B00B2TWDWG,"This is a really good workout, all of the shorter workouts within this DVD are all great. The reason for my 3-star rating is the distracting scenery in the background. The corner of the pool where they are working out has trees in the background. When they move around in front of the trees it really makes a person dizzy. At first I thought it was just me, but I've loaned this DVD to 2 different friends & they both said the same thing.  Great workout, just wish she would have been set-up in front of a more solid, less distracting background.",1368057600,4,546,4.352941176470588
5553536,4,B00B2TWDWG,"I bought 2 Jessica Smith DVD's recently, my first. This DVD was good for stretching and toning and a mild cardio workout. I felt good when I was done. That said, her new Walking DVD, Walking for Weight Loss was my favorite. I wanted a low impact (bad knees) that would get my heart rate up. Her second segment the power walk, was terrific. I was a little disappointed after that DVD, that this cardio was less intense. Also the heavy emphasis on squats I had to modify a lot. If you have no issues with your knees, squatting is a great exercise, but I can't do it as often as she suggested. I can jog a little, walk, etc. but it was a little to top heavy in that area for me.
If you want an overall exercise DVD that incorporates a little of everything, that you can break up into 20 minutes segments, this is great. If you want more cardio, check out her new Walking DVD.",1368057600,23,872,4.165680473372781
5553537,5,B00B2TWDWG,"My first and continuing impression of Total Body Balance by Jessica Smith is beautiful. Jessica presents four well-choreographed, creative workouts that individually are a complete total body workout. But if you have more time, the individual workouts can be combined into a longer set based on what ""moves"" you. The workouts flow in a quick paced, yet doable, fashion. Time is spent efficiently. As always, Jessica takes time to build the movement, emphasizing proper form and technique. She even gives reminders just when you start to slip. (How does she know my form is suffering?) Cuing is superb. Jessica and Asha work hard which inspires me to work hard too. Before I know it, I have finished a workout and have worked up a good sweat. As others have mentioned, the scenery and music are lovely. However, that is not what makes this DVD beautiful. It is feeling energized and empowered after completing Jessica's Total Body Balance.",1367971200,7,938,4.980891719745223
5553538,5,B00B2TWDWG,"This DVD has 4  workouts to choose from . They are so excellent! I love Cardio Flow so much-all standing flowing cardio moves with a lovely poolside backdrop. The music is so perfect and the moves get the blood pumping and the heartrate up without killing you! 20 mins of Bliss. Sole Sculpt is a fabulous flowing sculpting routine using 3 or 5 lb weights-LOVE! Core Stretch is also lovely and graceful and Dance Sculpt is high energy fun that really gets a lot of bang for your buck! The back ground is a bright white spa setting with scenery outside of the window. It just gives a crisp and clean feel to the workout and is perfect. Jessica is simply wonderful as the instructor and creator of all these innovative routintes. She really shines and her talent for creating and instructing workouts for women is really her gift! She is informative, fun , caring and not annoying at all! You can mix and match the workouts or just do one.
