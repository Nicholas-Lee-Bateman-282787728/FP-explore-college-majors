525751,5,6302969603,"This masterpiece, filmed in occupied France with a cast which included resistance workers, portrays the conflicting emotions which distract men and women from truly loving.  A wonderful cast, perfectly suited to their  imaginative roles, seeks happiness in the early 19th century French theater  world.  Through the contrasts of divergent personalities and styles, Carne  strips away the superficial, yet powerful, desires and distractions of  intensely individual characters to reveal the central essence and  motivation at the heart of each player.  Garance, the beautiful and tragic  female lead, serves as the hub at the center of a grinding wheel of love  and hate and jealousy.  The men around her--a mime, a stage actor, a  murderer, and a lonely aristocrat--fight with themselves and their worlds  to discover the key which Garance holds outstretched in her delicate hand.",911606400,4,880,5.477611940298507

525847,2,6302969603,"I see every Marvel super hero movie that comes along and I love them all.  With that said, Children of Paradise on VHS was the best film I have ever seen.  The story lines, characters and performances are all terrific.  But it is the poetry of the dialogue that makes the movie transcendent and timeless. I cannot understand conversational French.  I rely on the subtitles.  That is where the DVD lost me.

The revised subtitles strip out the poetry in favor of a more economical and direct language.  The revised subtitles are easier to read than the VHS version, which is more faithful to the original language (I remember enough high school French to recognize some of the words), just as it is much easier to read the Cliffs Notes to Hamlet rather than the actual play.  The question is, why should anybody bother?

If Criterion issued the DVD with ""original poetic"" subtitles and the subsequent ""modern/efficient/artless"" subtitles as an alternative track, I would buy that DVD and praise it to the heavens.  Criterion could easily do it, given that they already have all of the content.  Just make the disc!

Watching a movie in a foreign language is a lot of work, particularly for Americans (like me).  As it stands now, there are so many other good movie choices out there that a non-French speaker has no reason to bother with the Cliffs Note version of this masterpiece.",1438732800,12,1381,4.7280334728033475

525880,4,6302969603,"James Michener, in The Seekers, says basically that the human race can be divided between those who have seen Children of Paradise and those who have not. That is a pretty high recommendation. So, I took a break from reading The Seekers and rented the movie. Honesty, I did not find it to be a defining milestone in human culture (Sorry Mr. Michener). Still it was surprisingly powerful for a 70 year old French art movie. The picture quality was pristine-- crystal clear. The acting was unashamedly stylized but emotionally intense. Its depiction of 19th century theater, was lovingly constructed by actors who were not chronologically far removed from those times. In that way, it was a window back into another age of acting. I recommend it particularly for scholars of theater history.",1432598400,5,789,4.93984962406015

525887,5,6302969603,"Children of Paradise is one of those films Ive known for a very long time I needed to see.  Its been on my watch list for years, and in fact was even on my DVR for months before my wife deleted it, much to my furiousness.  One of the reasons that it took me so long to actually watch the film was that I really felt the need to commit the whole 3+ hours to watching it.  I didn't want to watch this in parts, and finding a full three hours, uninterrupted and with all of my faculties, is very, very hard.  I just never have that much time.  I work two jobs, I have three kids, I have a wifeI barely have a life anymore, and by the time I get around to popping a movie in, its near midnight and twenty minutes in, Im asleep.

I found the timea rainy Sunday when the wife was sick in bed and the kids were out of the house at my mothers.  I settled into the couch with a smile on my face and a glass of wine and before long, I was in cinematic heaven.

Children of Paradise is a film that was made for me.  Ive been a longstanding advocate (quite vocally) for all things epic and all things French, and when you combine the two you make me a very happy man.  Give me melodramatics done right!  Give me tattered love stories steeped in well placed theatrics!  Give me dialog dripping with sensual subtext!  Give me those longing stares and those complex character developments and those unforgettable plights!  Give me Marcel Carne molding such richness out of a tragic tale of love, loss and fate!

I ate this up.

The story centers on a love triangle of sorts that is turned into a square that splinters into a few directions thanks to many, many hearts in the fire.  Garance is a beautiful and confident young woman, an actress, who captures the attention, and the heart, of a theater mime named Baptiste.  Baptiste lacks the self-confidence to make a move and inevitably loses his chance when fellow actor and egomaniac Frederick Lemaitre waltzes in and makes Garance his mistress.  It doesnt end there though.  Garance catches the eye of the Count Edouard, who makes his advances, and his services, known to the actress, who is also being pursued by a petty thief.  When her reputation is compromised by certain connections, she finds herself running off with the Count, only to return years later to reignited passions with Baptiste, who is now married to the jealous Nathalie, who has borne him a son.

Carne handles the weight and expanse of this film with such care and delicacy, developing every facet of this ensemble with such richness.  While the core may really comprise of Baptiste, Frederick and Garance, the characters of Nathalie, the Count, Lacenaire and even a slovenly Jericho feel complete and complimentary to the film.  Jean-Louis Barrault is remarkable as the lovelorn Baptiste, delivering a performance that is one of the greatest Ive ever seen put to film (seriously, so developed, so honest, so layered), and the beautiful sets and costumes just make this film feel so complete in storytelling, texture and impact.",1418860800,4,3039,4.544117647058823

Many of the other reviews here give you a great deal of interesting information about the film and several of them are quite illuminating. Yes, it has often been called the Gone With The Wind of art films, and it's certainly an epic, but it's so much more than that as well.

Quality-wise, this is a simply superb 4K restoration. You really could not expect anything clearer or sharper.

525958,5,6302969603,"Yup. I guess it becomes very subjective at some point, as to what looks good to you. Yes-this version is before PATH did a restoration resulting in the subsequent CRITERION Blu-ray version and the European PATH Blu-ray version.
Yes-this version is presented on 2 DVDs rather than 1 Blu-ray. Yes-the Blu-rays have a lot more extras.
BUT... I (in my humble opinion), think they over-tweaked the image on the new Blu versions. The European PATH version has contrast issues (too dark), and the CRITERION blu image seems a little too softened. I looked at 3 different transfers, and this is the one that pleased me the most. I wish it was a Blu because I love that they are scratch resistant unlike standard DVD, and having the film on one disc is nice... But I think this is the better looking version.

525962,5,6302969603,"So many reviewers, critics and French film buffs have already said it.... ""the greatest French film ever"".... I agree.  Perhaps for different reasons!  Barrault's performance as the ""mime"" is beyond compare and he studied hard to achieve that.  Having the very best in French actors to play the parts of the ""quartet"" (three of them based on true historical characters!)  obsessed with  the beautiful ""Garance"", Arletty's character,  was a stroke of genius.  Each one is perfectly cast in the part they play.  Arletty is so perfect as ""Garance"" just  as  Maria Casares is as ""Nathalie"".  Written in collaboration by Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert, the entire ""team"" around Carne were his favorites  worked  dedication to create a monumental work of art.  The dangers and restrictions of the occupational forces were an ever present obstacle but the team was determined and did succeed in leaving a legacy of beauty for the beholders immediate, present and future.

525964,5,6302969603,"I am fortunate to have found out about the ""Children Of Paradise"" film from the online recommendations of Amazon Canada. ""Children Of Paradise"" is a film set in France and shows a beautiful woman named Claire Garance Reine, who is romantically admired by at least four men. Garance appears to be passionately in love with a gifted mime named Baptiste. Garance's desire to exercise freedom in her personal life is indirectly shaped by the death of her mother as she was coming of age. The complicated twist to this situation is that a woman named Nathalie is also intensely in love with Baptiste.  There is much more  suspense and intrigue to this movie than what this summary lists. ""Children of Paradise"" is a superb choice for those who are curious about watching films that relate to life of citizens who worked in theater and how it ties into the indirect dealings of those who were part of the upper class culture. For instance, Garance ends up meeting a man who is one of her admirers and is part of the French aristocracy. This event is only one part of multiple incidents in the film on why the ""Children of Paradise"" metaphorically fits the movie's theme.",1376265600,,1164,4.673170731707317

The ""Theatre street"" with its ever-changing panorama, the interwoven stories of loves lost and found, requited and unrequited, and the marvelous stage performances within the film, that reflect the emotions of the players -- these are all the things about it I cherish.  And they are all played in such a natural style, very unlike most modern films.

As for the subtitles -- I took a friend to see it, who knows not only no French, but had not much formal education, and doesn't even read much, and she loved this film right away, for the ""wild overflowing with life"" character of it.  I hesitate to use more superlatives, because you might then be disappointed, and feel misled.  Although I have encountered a few who don't like it or are indifferent to it, I have read or talked to many more who feel it is ""the greatest film of all time"", or ""one of the greatest"", or as revered in Europe as ""Gone with the Wind"" is in the U.S.  There are other films I like very much, but this is the one I return to the most.",1375488000,4,1181,4.36986301369863

Yesterday I watched this new Blu-ray edition and cannot understand one complaint here about the video quality. Did we both watch the same film? I realize we're all entitled to our opinions however... You can read my reply on the COMMENT section of his review. I watched it on a Panasonic 42"" Viera LCD/LED combo fed from a new LG BP 620, both highly rated units.  Considering the age of the film, the conditions under which it was filmed, and the disclaimer in the opening credits about how some scenes were filmed in soft focus and others were beyond repair, I think this restoration is reasonably good and probably as good as possible. Images are sharp without overdoing it and there is enough detail shown in costumes and backgrounds. If you stand close enough to the screen, you will observe there is grain in the picture, in some scenes more noticeable. Certain scenes look better than others but that's true in many films. The only complaint I have is that daylight outdoor crowd scenes, such as the opening one, are a bit overly bright and could have used more contrast but that may be due to filming outdoors (instead of a controlled studio environment) with the white walls & costumes reflecting too much light in addition to cleaning up the print. On the disc there's a demonstration of the restoration you can watch on Criterion's website but Pathe has removed it for legal reasons

I also own the Criterion DVD 2002 edition and later started to play it with the commentary, which is the same on the new edition, for comparison. After watching the first 20 minutes and skipping around through the rest of the film, I couldn't watch it anymore because of the obvious inferior quality, although a decent restoration for its time without today's technology. The lack of detail was noticeable as well as the murkiness of dark scenes and backgrounds. I'll be trading in the old version at the first opportunity as this new version has spoiled me.

All I can say this restoration is NOT ''shockingly bad'' or ''completely sub-par.'' Is it a great restoration? No but it's much better than the previous one. Let's say it's good but not great due to the reasons I stated above. Perhaps this new restoration was over-hyped creating unfulfilled expectations for some viewers. Judge it for yourself as I did instead of relying on the opinions of others. I watched it twice in its entirety, the second time with the excellent commentary and I am concerned about video & audio quality as you can read from my other reviews. Another reason to own this edition is for the two new documentaries about the making of the film. A worthy upgrade on all levels and don't be swayed by any negative comments you read or hear. 5 Stars for the film and new documentaries; 4 for the restoration.",1369612800,6,3002,4.701520912547529

Superb remastering. Image as well as audio. I understand French, even the English subtitles are great, nothing is lost by the translation. A classic: whenever I see it again, I find new details. Unlike most films that you watch only once.
All actors excellent. Jean Louis Barrault superb.
I watched this film when I was 13. My mother took me to the cinema, it was my first serious movie. I am now 76, and was so impressed that I still remember it. So I decided I wanted to see it again. Amazon had it. No wonder.

The entrancing story of ""The Children of Paradise"" is filmed in the theaters --- and, especially ""Crime Boulevard"" in front of the theaters. The main female character is Garance (Arletty), a former ""courtesan"" --- actually hard to describe her, except that she is beautiful and very kind.  The main male character is the mime Baptiste, played by Jean-Louis Barrault, who is madly in love with Garance.

By the end of this film, Baptiste's cries of ""Garance! Garance!"" may remind you of Scarlett's cries of ""Ashley!  Ashley!""

It's gets a star for the crowd scenes, very well faked, not staged looking like the comparable Gone with the Wind (also a terribly overblown and boring soap opera.) Good reviews rave about ""the trouble it had being filmed in occupied France"" -- so, does that make every film made in occupied countries better? The only good actor in the film is Arletty, and even she seems to smirk at the inane ""dialogue of love"", which is totally unbelievable at all times. If the French are truly like this, no wonder they lost every modern war! The only other plus goes to the fine Criterion print: I hear that it's a major improvement over the theatrical or VHS versions, but that still won't fix the boring plot, the length, the cutesy mimes, or the over-acting.

Director Marcel Carn worked under horrible circumstances, filming as the Germans were invading Paris. The turn of the century period flavor is beautifully captured, and though France's economy was teetering, the ambivilence of the then-King (Louis-Philippe?) allowed everything and anything to happen. The public sought refuge from the daily grind in the theatre, and shows went on all day. Most interesting. ""L'Enfants du Paradis"" was nominated (1946) for Jacques Prevert's complex screenplay. The following year they started giving special Oscars to Foreign Language Films. The VERY American Academy didn't seem to know that brilliant films were made elsewhere. Fritz Lang was never nominated, nor Renoir (at least not for a foreign language film). That ""Grand Illusion"" was nominated for Best Picture in 1938 is confusing; it's only nomination. (Certainly deserved)That may explain why Jean-Louis Barrault wasn't nominated. We had to wait till Sophia Loren exploded with her magnificent performance in '61 in ""Two Women"", before the Academy took notice.

526159,5,6302969603,"I got the two CD set as a rental and I will relate my exasperation with CD number one because I have an observation or two to share from that experience.  The problem with CD #1 was that I could not play it without having to bear the running commentary (in English) of some ""expert"" who presumably spent 3 hours describing the various important aspects of the film.  In fairness to this individual, his preface stated that you wouldn't be listening to him unless you'd already seen the movie.  However, I was not granted that reprieve.  I tried a variety of ways to shut him off (I realize I'm probably saying more about my own technological ineptness) but the only resolution was to watch the first CD with no sound (there were, of course, English subtitles that enabled me to follow along).  Well, the movie was OK but nothing to live up to its' billing.

After all the false starts, it was too late to watch the second CD so, after playing the beginning and hearing the actor's French instead of the ""expert's"" English, I called it a night.  Today I watched (and listened to) the second CD and was completely blown away.  I could only surmise that I was really missing the effect of the first CD by not getting the audio effect; especially, the inflections and emotions of the actor's voices.  I was reading the same subtitles but, this time around, there was a world of knowledge and meaning in everything that was being said.  I recognize the absence of all the previous night's frustration as well as the presence of the effects of a good night's sleep may have combined to aid the impact of the second CD.  I also surmised that setting the stage can be laborius at times (like reading a book that doesn't take off until page 220).  However, my two observations from this experience are 1) always watch a foreign language film in it's original audio with subtitles in order to get the real effect of the movie.  I know people who won't watch a foreign movie unless it's dubbed already (and many of the older, lesser movies are that way).  I tell these friends that they are leaving much of the film's artistry in the hands of someone whose real talent is having a flexible speaking tempo that fits the movements of the screen actor's mouth.  My second observation is that no one should pass judgement on ""Les Enfant's du Paradis"" until they've watched the whole movie.  Don't worry, it didn't take long into the second CD before greatness started spewing forth.

""Les Enfants du Paradis"" is a stunning portrate of a group of people in 19th Century France and their relationships with one another.  They are all from different backgrounds and economic levels but their actions and inactions affect one another.  That's the plot of many movies (especially if you throw out the part about 19th Century France).  However, in this movie, the dialogue is virtually Shakespearean (come to think of it, some of the dialogue IS Shakespearean).  I found myself awed by the depth of meaning in the words that I was reading (and hearing with the excellent acting once I got the audio).  If special effects and action are your thing, this is not your movie.  However, if the slings and arrows of misguided fortune enchant your artistic appreciation, this movie is a must.",1200182400,5,3264,4.638260869565217

526161,4,6302969603,"Children of Paradise (Marcel Carne, 1945)

First off, a warning: Les Enfants du Paradis is not the movie you want to rent if you're looking for a straightforward movie of any sort. While it is, in fact, a romance, a comedy, an adventure film, and a drama, it is all of those things in the most roundabout, labyrinthine way; it is, more than anything, a masterpiece of surrealism (surrealism as opposed to the dada of, say, Luis Bunuel's early work). This is nosurprise, with a script written by seminal surrealist Jacques Prevert.

The story, what there is of it, focuses on Garance (played by Arletty, the thirties version of what we'd call a supermodel today). Garance is loved by four men: actor Frederick Lematire (Eyes without a Face's Pierre Brasseur), thief Pierre Lacenaire (The Count of Monte Cristo's Marcel Herrand), Count Edouard de Montray (The Charterhouse of Parma's Louis Salou), and mime Baptiste (J'Accuse!'s Jean-Louis Barrault), with things complicated by Nathalie (The Ladies of the Bois du Bologne's Maria Cesares in her film debut), who's in love with Baptiste, who only has eyes for Garance. Now, all this is well and good, and the story itself is well-done, but the real brilliance of the film is as a period piece; it's set in nineteenth-century France, and Prevert misses no opportunity to wander away from his story and explore the customs, oddities, politics, and intricacies of the period. Obviously, this sort of thing has been done badly many times; Prevert and Carne do not do it badly. Their characters are interesting, no matter how major or minor they may be, and keep everything else interesting (mesmerizing might be a better word) as well. This is a big, big movie in every way, but it's well worth the investment you'll make in it. A perennial entry on all-time 100-best lists, and deservedly so.

526162,5,6302969603,"""Children of Paradise"" is set in pre 1840 Paris, on Boulevard of Crime and is a richly entertaining and intensely romantic. It is the story of infatuation, jealousy, deception, grief, murder, and true love lost forever. The film tells of an unattainable beautiful courtesan named Garance (unforgettably played by Arletty who was over 40 and seemed not to care at all if she looked her age) and four men who love her - the famous mime Baptist (Jean-Louis Barrault is matchless), the actor, Frederick LeMaitre, the criminal Pierre-Franois Lacenaire, and the aristocrat Comte de Montray. She loved one of them and the affair was doomed. The film is so much more than just a romantic story (which is absolutely beautiful and compelling) - it is a love song to the Art of Theater where art imitates life and vice-versa and the hidden symbolism of freedom and despotism (the film was made in Paris during the Nazi Occupation under immensely difficult circumstances).

Jacques Prevert wrote the brilliant and ironic scenario and dialog; Marcel Carne superbly directed the film. Its larger than life and gloriously three-dimensional characters, narrative skill and the sweep of production make it a true cinema triumph.

I have mostly watched the American classics (silents through the 50's) and have recently expanded my movie universe to French/Japanese classics.  What an eye opening experience so far.

This movie is long but it didn't seem long at all. Great character development...incredible scenes.  The story was awesome and so moving.  I was literally stunned at the ending.  Such a non-Hollywood way of doing it.  This movie was so enchanting that I was so sad that the movie had to end.  THAT is a sign of a great movie or book.  Another trait is when you know you can't live without seeing/reading this movie/book again in your life.

This movie is best when it is in French with legible subtitles.  Criterion did a fine job and the commentary seemed really good from what little snatches I heard.  I really think this is one of the best movies I have ever seen...and I've seen a lot.

526165,5,6302969603,"It is impossible to overpraise this film on any dimension of quality. Visually, it is so rich that I have found in my many watchings of it that it is worth taking your eyes off the centre of the screen and just absorbing what is going on at its peripheries. Depth of image, chiarascuro, mise-en-scen, mood and texture -- all are so nuanced. The cast is almost the definitive Classical Academy of French film and drama of the last century. Only Jean Marais is missing (catch him along with the underrated Maria Casares, who plays the only muted -- and smewhat boring -- part in Les Enfants -- in Cocteau's Orphee -- same period roughyl, same visual brilliance and the same five star rating), Pierre Barasseur, whose 19th century grand passion performance from Othello is in itself superb, the haunting Jean-Louis Barrault who with his wife Madeleine Renaud was the leader in classical French theater post World War II, and of course Arletty, the enigma around whom the entire film centers.... I cannot think of any film with such a peerless cast. Them there is Jaques Prevert's script.... And Carne's direction is peerless, reflecting perhaps his own very enigmatic personality; his other films share the visual and dramatic power of Les Enfants but seem more dated; here, somehow he found the exact style to create a film deeply rooted in history but not locked into it. No one has ever directed such a cast of varied and great actors and given them so much space of expression and style while maintaining a unity.

The film is Balzacian in its breadth of story -- reminiscent of Pere Goriot perhaps? -- and covers so many moods and themes and scenes. It can be very funny -- Brasseur as the vain, worldly Frederick LeMaitre -- and so deeply sad -- Barrault as Baptiste, both of which are portrayals based on real actors of the 19th century and both of which are genuinely great in their capturing of the grand acting style of the period without this being pastiche or artificial.

It is impossible to overrate this film. If you haven't seen it, don't be put off by the idea that it's a period piece, black-and-white, French and sure to be boring. It's over sixty years old now and still profoundly beautiful, deeply moving and most of all unforgettable.",1152748800,14,2254,4.703797468354431

526167,5,6302969603,"An astonishing film made under almost impossible circumstances. Set in Paris in the 1840s along a lower-class theatre district (the ""Boulevard of Crime""), the main story is about a mime (played by Jean-Louis Barrault) who falls in love with ""a woman of experience"" - played brilliantly by Arletty. In an incredibly poignant and delicate scene, Arletty just about begs Barrault to make love to her, but he doesn't seize the moment and he leaves her. She finds lust in the arms of others.

Other major characters include a degenerate philosopher/writer; a Shakespearean actor; a rich count who ""keeps"" Arletty; and the woman who loves Barrault and eventually marries him. But the love between Barrault and Arletty remains true down through the years, though at the end, after spending one glorious night together, she leaves him for good. The acting is superb throughout, though what makes the movie a masterpiece is the writing of Jacques Prevert: the dialogue is simply brilliant. The movie was filmed during the Nazi occupation and many of the actors would leave the set to go off and fight in the resistance. Sets were constantly moved to avoid bombing raids and Nazi interference, when possible. The film is c. 190 minutes long; the Nazis had a law that no film could exceed 90 minutes, so this was made as TWO independent films. The movie is not only a testament to love in all its passionate intensity (it is a French movie, after all), it is also about the survival of a country and great city, Paris - an entire civilization, actually - suffering under the bootheel of a fierce oppressor: it is about the light of love and culture and memory shining ever brightly out of the darkness of hell. An astounding achievement in all phases of the moviemaking process, from the story's message to the sets to the acting to the photography: it's a movie for all time.",1141171200,12,1865,4.791925465838509

Baptiste is a very talented mime, more than a street mime, a wonderful actor who rises to renown in France.  During the first disk of this two disk film, Baptiste does an amazing job of portraying emotions and comedy in mime.  He is the hero of the film, if there is a hero.  He is the innocent, the true lover, except for the little detail that he married someone else and had a son.  Oops.

Frederick is an extremely talented actor with a quick wit.  He can singlehandedly turn a dreadfully written drama into a fresh and enjoyable comedy with his improvisation.  He too loves Garance, but not very seriously.  His main love is the theatre.

Garance's third lover is the murderer, the thief, the dandy.  He is an intellectual who believes himself to be above it all, thanks to his brilliance.  He is impotent, so his love for Garance will not progress into a sexual affair, and he is corrupt, a dangerous man capable of anything.

Garance's fourth lover is the wealthy count, who she lives with but does not love in return.  She always refers to him as mon ami, my friend.  He is capable of cruelty and selfishness, so he does not earn our sympathies.

In a terrific turn of the plot, there is a confrontation between the wealthy count and the marvelous actor Frederick, and we are all on Frederick's side.  Then there is a confrontation between the count and the murderous dandy, and if you think about it, this confrontation probably saves Frederick's life, with one thing and another going on.  I don't want to give it away.

Our heroes, Garance and Baptiste, are difficult heroes because they are so confused.  They have made some bad choices in their lives.

Other reviewers on this site have commented that Garance is played by an actress who is not as beautiful as the four men make her out to be.  She was in her late 40s when the film was made.  You can see that she has an abundance of class, intelligence, and poise, but no, she is not a sex symbol.  I like the way she stands her ground in every conversation and tells her truths, never shying away from saying exactly what is on her mind.

I don't see any symbolism in the film.  I take it at face value, as the story it tells.  That's enough.  Garance does not symbolize Nazi-occupied France to me.  Of course not.  Why should she?  Looking for symbolism where it is neither necessary nor apparent is a pointless search.

It's a nice thought that the writers of this film were sending us secret messages about France under the boot of the invaders, but that really has absolutely nothing to do with the story.  The story stands on its own.",1119571200,6,2856,4.426923076923077
526198,5,6302969603,"This  film is on my top ten list and I do not think I  am alone.
With this  new Criterion edition we see ""Children of Paradise"" close to how people saw it when it was first released.

The pairing of director, Michael Carne, and the writer, poet Jacques Prvert, create  an enduring masterpiece. Their association with the surrealists show in this film. Yet it is a film that also has a gritty realism about it.

It is a truly magnificent film of many levels. It is about  art, human nature, class structure  as well as many other things but above all it is about love and its complexities.
It is heartbreaking in its portrayal of love between man and woman and what a complex dance love  can be.

The cinematography  and lighting  heartbreakingly beautiful. The character development and the  complexity of the characters  is  outstanding. The main  characters  are  each quite unique and symbolic but what each symbolizes is  not so easy to define and I believe  this  is something that is intentional. That is one reason  you will want to watch this movie again and again.

The beginning of the movie begins with scenes of  a crowded street of  vendors and entertainers. It is there where Baptiste and Garance first meet. As  Baptiste the mime is on stage  in a type of freak show playing a somnambulist an upper class man in the crowd  gets his watch stolen and accuses Garance of stealing it. As the  authorities are about to cart her away Baptiste comes to her rescue, humorously miming to the crowd  what really happened.

The movie is centered around a theater and a theater troupe.
The  theater is an aging place and presents uneven performances  and its patrons are rowdy and boisterous. Is the theater a symbol of the world itself? Is the theater's management and the players  symbolic  of  government and  a dissatisfied people it governs?

Among the many unforgettable  characters I will list  just a few.
There is Jericho ""The Rag and Bone Man"" a fence and informer who sings out his many names like the town crier. A ""rat-like"" man with a  pack of good forever on his back who is  both funny, sometimes a type of ""Robinhood"" and yet sinister. He is like Santa Claus  with his sack of goodies  yet he cannot be trusted. One wonders if he  has a center or is  forever changing in his largess and alliances.
 There is Garance whose stated  philosophy is ""love is so simple"" and yet  we get the feeling she knows this is not the complete truth.
And there is a clever and sensitive mime named Baptiste who is smitten with Garance  but his love is  so strong  for her  it includes with it a respect and purity  that prevents him from expressing his passion.

  Baptiste is  not the only one who pursues Garance. There is  a  Lacenaire a  sinister criminal, Frederick a self absorbed actor,  and  a Count.  Of course the rest of them are much more obvious  and less pure about their affections than Baptiste. Unfortunately the rest of the suitors have more to offer in terms of  being able to give  expensive trinkets. We would like to think, like Baptiste, that Garance ca not be bought. And although Baptiste is  Garance's protector, is sensitive, true and perhaps  every thing one would think  a woman would want their union is not to be. Baptiste is seemingly so right for Garance and Baptiste loves her more than life itself but it is not to be. I almost reminds one of Freud's classic question ""what does woman want?""

There is one  touching scene in the movie that is famous in the history of film  where Baptiste, Frederick and Garance are on stage together with Garance  standing on a pedestal and  Baptiste  the mime mute and unacknowledged. Indeed much of what happens between the characters in real life are sometimes heartbreakingly replayed on the stage.

The movie  was made under difficult conditions in occupied France  and under the watchful eyes of the Nazi censors and yet there are  some definite political themes  brought out in the movie.

Does Garance stand for the nation of France itself? It is possible that the free and easy Garance is  in someway symbolic of  Vichy  France?
Or are the suitors of Garance  the temptations and paths Carne and Prevert  saw France as facing at the time? Baptiste is the pure and artistic. Frederick  is a pompous artist whose talent does not  match his ego. Lacenaire is brutal yet pragmatic.  Of course the count who courts Garance is a member of the aging aristocracy.

I do not want to force my interpretations on the viewer  but these are some ideas one might consider the SECOND time you view it.

The first time you watch the film let your mind wander and be swept way.

For another interesting take on this movie please see Professor Edward Baron Turk's book on the film.

Pure cinematic poetry.

526199,5,6302969603,"To call Marcel Carne's ""Children of Paradise"" a masterpiece is to understate its case. It's more than that.

 The film was made during WW2 and visually you couldn't ask for something more different than what we see here. For audiences who watched this movie when first released you never would have guessed a war was going on. The movie transports you to another time and yet some of the theme presented here are similar to that of the experience of WW2. We have fear and sorrow, uncertainty of the future, and loneliness. These were things people felt during the war. In fact these are things people feel at anytime in history.

 The movie though has such a beautiful look. You could just turn the volume off shut the subtitles off and simply look at the film. Visually it reminded me of the films of Jean Cocteau. The costumes, the streets, the hotels it's all eye candy.

 The story revolves around Garance (Arletty) and the love affairs she has with three men; Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault), Frederick (Pierre Brasseur), and Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand). Baptiste is a mine who at first sight falls in love with Garance, despite being the object of affection for another woman. But when Baptiste has he chance with Garance, he passes it up. Enter Frederick. Frederick is a bit of a free loader but has dramatic aspirations. And it time becomes a famous actor. When Garance comes knocking at his door he takes advantage of it, breaking Baptiste's heart. And finally there is Lacenaire, a lowly theif who at first tells Garance he has no feelings for him and she none for him. But soon he wants to control her. For me the story comes second to the visuals. After watching the movie if we remember anything about it I doubt the story will stick with so strongly. It is everything else that is memorable. But despite this the movie went on to earn only one Academy Award for ""Best Screenplay"" (Jacques Prevert). Of course the real shame here is the movie only earned one Oscar nomination. But since when has the Academy actually nominated worthwhile films anyway?

 I'm actually not familar with director Carne and going over his list of credits I foind that I'm not familar with any of his work. I look forward to seeing more by him.

 The only fault with ""Children of Paradise"" is at 3 hours and 7 minutes it's too short! There was far more story to tell. We want to know more about these people. The movie, like an epic novel, leaves us hanging wondering what will happen next for these people. I suppose some might feel if I'm so bothered by this why don't I take off a star or two, but, I've never seen a movie that was over 3 hours and left me wanting more. I was so involved that I just don't care. I think it's a sign of the film's strenght that I wanted to watch more. And you will too. Here we have a film of rare beauty. A movie that shows us films have the power to transport us to another world.

This is one of the most perfect movies ever made; if the audience is willing to shelve, just for a moment, their contemporary notions of beauty and can let themselves believe that the object of all men's desire in this movie is, in fact, stunningly beautiful. That was the only hurdle I faced watching this movie on the strength of nothing but its reputation; once I allowed my factory-set notions of beauty to be swept away by the power of the film, everything fell into place.
Amazingly, I had already seen a segment of the film unwittingly -- one of the pantomimes, excerpted at a National Gallery touring exhibit on clowns in art. I had been spellbound by it then, and had forgotten the name of the movie it was attached to, and was delighted to discover that the five-minute excerpt that I had found so brilliant and beautiful was accompanied by another nearly three hours (!!) of equally wonderful work.
I've never had a movie of this length go by so quickly. There is no second-act lag. There is no feeling of a grind to the finish at the end, which is rare for somebody of my limited attention span. Everything fits together like clockwork -- plot, characters, direction, music, sets, costumes -- so perfectly that the thrill of seeing how the film works is as great as the narrative itself.

or

'I don't like France.  They're fruity and have bad GNP because they're leftists.'

See, the problem with such reviews is that the criticism is stunted by the reviewer's own mental retardation.  There are arguments to be made that this film is over-rated.  I myself would not necessarily label it the 'best French film of the 20th century.'  It does nevertheless present a brilliantly deep story.  I know it's hard to believe that anything could be deeper than Titanic (I mean nobody even 'tragically' dies after having a quick cheap romance/fling), but this film even tops that monolith of taste and deep seated romantic emotion

526202,4,6302969603,"Les Enfants Du Paradis was voted as number 1 French film of the

20th Century. In some quarters it is known as France's ""Gone With The Wind"" a reference to the films overall quality and greatness - although its content is totally different.

Criterion give this film the restoration and packaging it so richly deserves, as are the voice overs telling us the fascinating background of this movie.

Despite being filmed in black & white, Director Marcel Carne's opening shots of the Boulevarde du Crime in 1840's Paris with its maze of pedestrians and street performers all intermingled,

reminded me of Luhrman's Moulin Rouge.

Les Enfants Du Paradis was made during the Occupation years of 1943 to 1945, when dialoge was heavily censored, and actors writers et al of Jewish descent were forced to flee Paris from the Gestapo. Despite all this undercurrent, the film was complted without the Germans knowing and released at wars end to a joyous international audience.

The film is set in Funamble Theatre, Paris and tells the story of the lives and loves of the cast headed by reknown Paris mime artiste Jean Louis Barrault, who plays Baptiste, a mime street performer who falls in love with an actress named Garrance, beautifully played by Arletty. Other notables in the cast are Pierre Brasseur and Pierre Renoir.

My favourite moment of the film is when Baptiste and Garrance first meet. He is performing to the street throng in the aptly named Boulevarde du Crime, and she is watching him.

Suddenly, a man standing next to Garrance, accuses her of stealing his pocket watch. The police are called and the situation is looking her until Baptiste mimes for the police what really happened and Garrance is saved. Very Funny and cheeky, and magical all at the same time.

Each seek her in their own way, yet each selfishly encroaches her formidable freedom with their tragic flaws. The romantic needs her exlusively and needs her unconditional love, the aristocratic will only ever see her as an object, he will never 'love as a poor man'. The lover is too full of dramatic hyperbole for her truthful sensibility and the criminal can never love, for his dark humour and excessive intelligence can not grasp its simplicity.

For example, Arletty, the female lead, seemed too old for the role, and she and the mime (Barrault) have no romantic chemistry whatsoever. It also feels that important chunks of the film are missing. For example, when Arletty has to flee Paris with the Count, the event happens off camera. It seems as if the director filmed the parts where there was no action, and asked the audience to fill in the blanks. Yet, although my comments sound negative, I am glad I saw this film.

526229,5,6302969603,"Marcel Carne's Children of Paradise succeeds on so many levels that it rightfully deserves to be called one of the greatest films of all time. Carne filmed the movie piecemeal during the Nazi occupation of Paris. His film was officially supported despite the occupation, as the Nazis wanted to show that they were friendly to the arts. This created the ironic situation where Carne was taking money from the government to support a film by day and funneling help to the French resistance at night.
One actor was supposedly a nazi collaborator. He mysteriously disappeared during filming and had to be replaced. Despite all of these obstacles, Carne has managed to recreate 19th Century Paris magnificently. In this manner, the film itself is a triumph of the creative spirit.
The title refers to the poor, who could only afford seats so high in the theater that they were almost in the rafters... and yet, these were the real audiences the actors performed for. The story is a series of intersecting lives that all revolve in one way or another around the bohemian, world weary Garance (played in Mona Lisa fashion by Arletty). Beyond this, the film also revolves around 1840's theater life in Paris: the actors, the audience, and all those in between. Garance is almost a courtesan: she moves conveniently between four men who love her, seemingly unaffected by any of them... in the end, she falls in love with the mime Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault).... but Baptiste is married to another woman after missing his chance with Garance years earlier. Will they get together?
In the end, we, the viewers are as much the Children of the Gods, or Children of Paradise, that the title refers to as the theater audiences in the film. Indeed, both the opening and closing credits are played against a theater curtain. We are the viewers in the Gods, and the actors are performing for us by living their lives: loving, living, dying... feeling both pain and joy. Carne's film is over three hours long, but never lags. The stories intersect each other and cannot be adequately described in a simple review such as this... Four men love Garance, and in a way all their lives intersect in and around the theater.
The cinematography is amazing. There is a crowd scene at the end of the film that stands up to anything ever filmed: it is simply magnificent. Baptiste is lost (in many ways) in a seething moving mass of humanity. This scene alone is reason enough to see the film.
I suspect that this is a film that people either love or hate. The long length may put off many people, but this is a shame. The film isn't for those who want instant gratification. Instead, it is something to be enjoyed and savored. If all of this makes it sound too serious, be assured it isn't. Children of Paradise is a tragedy in some ways but it is also a comedy in the Shakespearian sense. This was a film made for a company like Criterion, and they do it justice in their dvd edition. The two halves of the film are presented on individual disks, so the film never suffers from compression flaws or other problems. The restoration is flawless: you would never know that this film is almost sixty years old. The audio is mono but very clean, with no hiss or static. Criterion has also included some supplements, inverviews, filmographies, trailers, etc, but the real treat is the film itself. It is timeless.",1050537600,17,3382,4.704890387858347

526231,5,6302969603,"CHILDREN OF PARADISE has a history almost as remarkable as the film itself.  Production was just beginning when Paris fell to the Nazis; the work was subsequently filmed piecemeal over a period of several years, much of it during the height of World War II.  And yet astonishingly, this elaborate portrait of 19th Century French theatre and the people who swirl through it shows little evidence of the obvious challenges faced by director Marcel Carne, his cast, and his production staff.  CHILDREN OF PARADISE seems to have been created inside a blessed bubble of imagination, protected from outside forces by the sheer power of its own being.

The story is at once simple and extremely complex.  A mime named Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault) falls in love with a street woman known as Garance (Arletty)--and through a series of coincidences and his own love for her finds the inspiration to become one of the most beloved stage artists of his era.  But when shyness causes him to avoid consumation of the romance, Baptiste loses Garance to her own circle of admirers--a circle that includes a vicious member of the Paris underworld (Marcel Herrand), rising young actor (Pierre Brasseur), and an egotistical and jealous aristocrat (Louis Salou.)  With the passage of time, Garance recognizes that she loves Baptiste as deeply as he does her... but now they must choose between each other and the separate lives they have created for themselves.

While the film is sometimes described as dreamy in tone, it would be more appropriately described as dreamy in tone but extremely earthy in content.  Instead of giving us a glamorous portait of life in theatre, it presents 19th Century theatre as it actually was: dominated by noisy audiences perfectly capable of riot, the actors usually poor and hungry and mixing freely with criminal elements, the desperate struggle to rise above the chaos to create something magical on stage.  And while the film is not sexually explicit by any stretch of the imagination, by 1940s standards CHILDREN OF PARADISE was amazingly frank in its portrayal of Garance's often casual liaisons; American cinema would not achieve anything similar for another twenty years.

Everything about the film seems to swirl in a riot of people, costumes, and overlapping relationships, a sort of mad confusion of life lived in a very elemental manner.  And the cast carries the director's vision to perfection.  Jean-Louis Barrault is both a brilliant actor and brilliant mime, perfectly capturing the strange innocence his role requires; the famous Arletty offers a divine mixture of exhaustion, sensuality, and self-awareness that makes Garance and her fatal attraction uniquely believable.  And these performances do not stand in isolation: there is not a false note in the entire cast, the roles of which cover virtually every level of society imaginable.

With its complex story, vivid performances, and stunning set pieces, the film has a longer running time than one might expect, and some may feel it is slow; I myself, however, did not read it as slow so much as precise. It takes the time to allow the characters and their various stories to develop fully in the viewer's mind. I must also note that while a knowledge of theatre history isn't required to fall under the spell of this truly fascinating film, those who do have that background will find it particularly appealing.  I regret to say that I have not seen the film on DVD, and I look forward to that.  But the double-tape video release, while plagued with occasional blips and streaks, is still very nice; the sound quality is good; and the subtitles are very clear and easy to read and follow.  But be it on DVD, video, or better still the big screen, this is truly a film that must be seen by any one that appreciates world cinema.  CHILDREN OF PARADISE is one of the few films that can be viewed repeatedly, one of the truly great masterpieces of cinema.  Strongly, strongly recommended.

526232,5,6302969603,"This film, ""Les Enfants du Paradis"" is absolutely splendid and remarkable.  The people, the places, the images, the words, the gestures are all verses in a monumental three-hour narrative poem.  The characters are fantastic!  Arletty as Garance is a sphinx, young and ancient, a creature of wisdom and whimsy.  And Barrault is absolutely a beautiful actor, and an incredibly sympathetic character.  Then again, all the actors are quite good.  Aside from those mentioned, fantastic performances are given by Brasseur (Gene Wilder 25 years early, and speaking French), Herrand, Casares, Renoir, and, well, everyone.  The closing shots are some of the most perfect in all of cinema!",1041379200,4,679,5.349056603773585

In addition, the new subtitles are more complete and far superior to those of years ago. As if this weren't enough to sell the package (frankly, I'd have bought the old, unimproved version if it were the only way I could get it), the ""extras"" are extra-ordinary! The full three hours of commentary is intriguing and detailed.

526254,5,6302969603,"Children of Paradise (Les Enfants du Paradis) possibly stands as the best french film ever made. It's production took many years due to the German invasion of France. Yet despide all problems the film is a total triumph.
The film is divided in two parts: ""The Boulevard of Crime"" and ""The Man in White"". The story spans several years in the lives of Babtiste (Barrault) who loves Garence (Arletty) who seems to end up destroying the hearts of those who fall for her. To reveal more would be unthinkable and the film presents us many subplots with great characters.
The sets are beautiful and the theatre numbers are fantastic. This is one film that brings us the true magic of Cinema with great stories, powerful drama and unforgetable characters. No other film ever captured the nineteenth century Paris like this one. A true work of art and a great homage to the french theatre. It will make you cry. It will make you laugh.
CRITERION (as always) did a wonderful job digitally restoring many print demages that were in the film. The extras are very nice (specialy the section devoted to the art direction - one of this film's greatest assets).

526256,5,6302969603,"Once again Criterion delivers one of the all time great French films, Marcel Carne's majestic ""CHILDREN OF PARADISE"" (""Les Enfants du Paradis"") in a superbly restored, bounteously filled two-disc digital transfer . The screenplay by poet Jacques Prevert is a celebration of theater, art, music and literature.  The story follows the life and loves of the serenely beautiful and worldy-wise Garance (Arletty) and the four masculine archetypes -- from sensitive to sordid -- with whom she becomes entangled.  This epic, wise, witty, romantic melodrama unfolds in an 1820s Parisian society teeming with hucksters, aristocrats, pimps, prostitutes, courtesans, psychics and performers.
The actress who went by the single name Arletty was born Leoni Bathiat. On screen and off she was perceived as a free spirit who believed in ""neither God nor the devil and still less in the men around her.""  Shortly after WWII she faced a prison sentence for having an affair with a Nazi officer.  In ""Children of Paradise"" Arletty dominates the screen and is a palpable force of light and shadow that reverberates somewhere deep in the psyche.
A decade ago this world class film underwent a major restoration for the laser disc.  For the DVD transfer, Criterion claims it digitally cleansed an additional 30,000 flaws and filtered minute snaps and pops on the sound track as well.  It is unlikely that a finer print of this magnificent black and white film exists anywhere.
The film itself is divided between the two discs.  Disc 1 ""The Boulevard of Crime"" features an insightful and clever introduction by Terry Gilliam who lauds the sheer theatricality of the enterprise as a perfect marriage of poetry and big budget filmmaking. An astute commentary is provided by film scholar Brian Stonehill.  He notes the difficulty of shooting this film during the German occupation.  Some of the work was even done in secret since production designer Alex Trauner and composer Joseph Kosma were Jewish.
Disc 2 concludes the film and features Prevert's original film story ""The Man in White,"" a still gallery, production art, the original U.S. trailer from 1947 (the film was released in Europe in 1945) and a terrific commentary by Charles Affron.  This wonderful, resplendent, sumptuous film seems to be a prime inspiration for the recent hit ""Moulin Rouge."" ""Children of Paradise"" is a film to own.  It's one of those all-too-few timeless classics about the human condition that truly entertains and does not wear out its welcome on repeated viewings.",1013126400,65,2527,5.139024390243902
526257,5,6302969603,"I've been waiting for the Children of Paradise DVD for a long time, as I've been watching a crummy VHS dupe that I made some years ago.
This is a great movie, and a great DVD.  The video is very clean, there's a nice interview with Carne in the booklet that's included, and the Terry Gilliam interview is a lot of fun.  I haven't looked at the subtitles or the commentaries yet, but I'd be very surprised if they're not first rate, based on the amount of time Criterion spent on this DVD, and on the high quality for which they're famous.
A lot of people have said a lot of things about Children of Paradise, and I'm not sure I have a lot to add to it.  It's a big romantic epic, very much larger than life, with a very earnest feel to it.  All of the actors are fabulous, with Arletty in particular turning in a great performance.
I find this to be a very human picture.  Perhaps not as intimate as some of the best the New Wave had to offer later, but remarkably so given the big studio soundstage techniques that Carne used.
I was a little saddened to learn a bit more from the liner notes about the circumstances under which this film was made -- I came away from them feeling that the anti-Nazi mindset of the production had been exaggerated in some of the legends, and that the real people living in the real world had made some compromises.  I never knew that Arletty had been the consort of a Nazi while she filmed this, for example.
But it is, despite and because of everything, a great film.",1012176000,7,1501,4.249122807017544
526258,5,6302969603,"Without a doubt, this is the greatest French Language film ever made. Watching it in this century makes you wonder how someone managed to create something of this depth and magnitude 80 years ago. I haven't seen this in a while, but I remember a year where I would watch parts of it every two weeks, and STILL couldn't get enough

At the time of its production, Children of Paradise was the most expensive film ever made in France. More interestingly, it was made during the Nazi occupation. The film combined the talents of the most renowned director and screenwriter of the 1940s, respectively Marcel Carne and Jacques Prevert.

Children of Paradise is often compared with Gone With the Wind. There are certainly similarities: both films are set in the 19th Century, both are over three hours long, both were expensive productions, and both had labyrinthian romantic entanglements between the main characters.

But the characters from Gone With the Wind do not cross over well to counterparts in Children to Paradise. Garance (Arletty) is more graceful, but far less determined, than Scarlett O'Hara. The same could be said for charming hedonist Frederick (Pierre Brasseur), the weak link to Rhett Butler. Mime extraordinaire Baptiste (Jean-Louis Barrault), devoted wife Nathalie (Maria Casares), foppish and wealthy intellectual Monteray (Louis Salou), and cynical criminal Lacenaire (Marcel Herrand) have no corresponding character at all.

It is true that both films are remarkably close to each other in terms of quality and historical importance. But perhaps comparing the two films is simply a promotional tactic to get English speaking audiences to see the film.

Children of Paradise is treasured primarily for its elegant, memorable, and romantic characters. But the dazzling film also has notable crowd scenes, both in the streets and in the theater. We see several plays within a play, most of which feature mime performances from Barrault. Americans have been culturally trained to regard mimes as irritating and effiminate. But it is easier to shallowly assign to a category, than to recognize as a legitimate art form something that one does not understand.

Arletty is arguable miscast; born in 1898, she is presumably too old to portray the love object of all four major male leads. While not a fantastic beauty, she has the natural grace that is more essential for the role.

Part of the allure of Children of Paradise comes from the mythology that surrounds its production. It would take a vast amount of research to separate fact from fiction, and the truth is always more complex than could ever be encapsulated anyway.

Legend has it that the release was deliberately delayed until France was liberated; that the cast and crew had many members of the resistance movement; that there were Jewish crew members who were hunted by the Nazis; that the production itself was kept hidden from the Nazis; that starving extras ate the buffets that were to be used as set pieces; that the film's story contains numerous allegories to the Nazi occupation; that the film was broken into separate halves to circumvent Nazi restrictions against films more than 90 minutes in length; that Jean-Louis Barrault was taught to be a mime by Etienne Decroux, who plays Baptiste's father in the film.

But even if the truth is that certain elements of the production actually collaborated with the Nazis, at least to a certain degree, it does not impact the quality of the film. The film is a definite fact, and it can speak very well for itself. Many people consider Children of Paradise to be the best film ever made.

It is probably the best film in the French language. The depth of character, plot, and performance puts to shame most so-called 'classic' American films.",1011830400,,3775,5.015974440894569
526259,5,6302969603,"I just bought this movie on DVD after seeing it on vhs last year and I was really anxious to rediscover it. The thing that amaze me the most about this masterpiece is the high quality of the writing. I've seen a lot of Marcel Carn's movies with Jacques Prvert's screenplays and let me tell you, this is a dream team of directing and writing. All the characters are different  so they all bring something of their own to the mix. Baptiste the mime, a romantic, gives Garance (Arletty) poetic words of love. Frdrick the great actor, also a seductor, brings words of love with a nice touch of humor. Lacenaire the criminal (my favorite character), the pessimist  whose rage against the world makes for the greatest black and intelligent writing I have ever seen in a movie. The count , a snob that you couldn't help but hate, brings the words of the upper class but always with wit and sarcasm. And Garance, stuck in the middle of  these casanovas, always sure of herself and always the right word  (great performance by Arletty by the way). So you have it, a 3 hour screenplay with words of love, humor, sarcasm, witty black dialogue and I didn't even talk about the great story (other reviewers did a great job doing it). Let just say that the performances are all great and the story plays real life like the theater, which is genius since the movie is about the theater. In this day and age of stupid one-liner and special effects with no decent screenplay (except maybe in independant films), this is a breath of fresh air. The transfer by Criterion is quite good. They restore the image and the sound and believe me the french films of this period (1940's) are in bad shape on vhs. They give a little restoration demonstration on disc one to show the work they did and it convince me that they made a good effort to restore it. I don't know if they improve the quality since the release of the laserdisc but it looks 10 times better than on vhs that's for sure. You have 2 audio commentaries (one for each part) and if you like this sort of thing, it's quite interresting and informative. Also, stills photos and a 24 page booklet.

It also combines the most delightful comedy with some of the most moving drama. The last scene is one of the more moving in any film and resembles the last scene in City Lights.
It tells the story of four main characters, a mime, a talented dramatic actor, a criminal and a courtesan.
The film starts in a theatre devoted to pantomime. The mime has an opportunity to star when another actor is injured. He is successful and he has a vision for recreating the theatre. The dramatic actor works for a while with him but soon goes off to become a great dramatic star.
Binding together their lives is the courtesan Garance. All of the principals lover her to some degree and she, quite unintentionally destroys some of their lives.

The story follows three men and the woman they love. Garance led a hard life when she was orphaned as a child and is kind to all but wise and independent of all attachments. She does not hope for love and is stronger than the men that love her. Baptiste Debureau, an extraordinary mime, is an artistic genius who loves simply and carries his pure-hearted empathy for his fellow humans into all his performances. Frederick Lemaitre is a grand actor with a courageous heart to match his skill on stage. Like Garance, he does not hope to love, but also like her, he falls victim to a bittersweet affection despite himself. My favorite character of all is the thief and murderer Lacenaire, who expresses a fierce admiration for truth and the exquisite ironies of life, despises society, has always known and loved Garance, and maintains a peculiar and noble dignity. Imagine a lucidity that enabled you to fully understand the world and your loved ones and then award yourself the tongue of an angel to express what you felt.

526263,4,6302969603,"In 1940's France, a country occupied by enemy troops, the atmosphere is tense with threats and resistance. That a sparkling work of art could have thrived in such a morass is as incredible as the idea of champagne being cultivated in a swamp. Yet it was in this atmosphere that the director Marcel Carn, the screenwriter Jacques Prvert. their cast and crew created ""Les Enfants du Paradis"", the film that goes back to the first half of the 19th Century and the colorful world of pre-Belle Epoque Paris. It is one of the best-directed, best-acted movies ever made; but more, it is a paean to the stage and its many fascinations. All types of entertainment are here, from the fraudalent peep show (the ""dressed in nothing but her"" beauty is submerged in a tub), through an abbreviated ""Othello"" (the curtin comes down as Desdemona is being dispatched), to a passing reference to bear-baiting, and culminating in Carnaval. The center of the story is the Fanambules, one of the most popular theatres of the period, where aristocracy may sit in the ""baignoires"" but the actors play to the top balconies -- the ""gods"" who make up the most enthusiastic portion of the audience. The intriguing Arletty was well into her forties (d'un certain ge) when she took on the role of Garance, the flower of the Boulevard du Temple (nicknamed the Boulevard du Crime due to its many murders), which was evidently the 42nd Street of 19th Century Paris. The men in her life include Baptiste Dubureau, a celebrated mime (Jean-Louis Barrault), Frdrick le Matre, an actor of melodrama who longs for Shakespeare (great performance by Pierre Brasseur), and Pierre Franois Lacenaire, a master criminal (Marcel Herrand). All these men are based on people who really lived. Because the cast is predominantly masculine, Arletty stands out in bright relief. The only other important female is Nathalie, Baptiste's sweet, long-suffering wife, played by Maria Casars, who later portrayed the ultimate femme fatale in Cocteau's ""Orfe"". Due to production restrictions imposed by the Vichy government, the picture had to be filmed as two separate features. The second half takes place several years after the events of the first half. (The time scheme is a little vague.) Many of the characters have not seen each other for all that time; would they really have been able to pick up the broken threads of their relationships and start over again? But, contrived though it may seem, it gives a rich aura to the second half, which if anything is even more romantic than the beginning. Garance has become the mistress of a wealthy count (Louis Salou), though Baptiste is still her true love. Meanwhile both Frddrick and Lacenaire have made their own unpleasant acquaintances with the count. All this leads to one of the great climaxes in cinema, the boulevard teeming with Carnaval while the various characters head for uncertain destinies. (With the exception of the count: his destiny has been firmly settled.) The film begs for color  la ""Rouge et Noir"" but once again, I assume, production costs made this impossible. (And today's colorization {mon dieu!} is out of the question.) However, this does not detract from the film's overall effect, which is one of sweeping imagination. ""Les Enfants du Paradis"" is a great romance, but it's more than just a love story. It's a Valentine to the world of the Theatre.",976752000,8,3375,4.941901408450704
526307,4,6302969603,"It's interesting how distilling a film's description to its essential description can make it sound appalling: Children of Paradise is a 3.25  hour black & white French melodrama prominently featuring a mime. Did I  mention that it was French?
I say these things, because it is all well  and good to say this is a masterpiece, but some people will be inherently  repelled by its form.
Nevertheless, those that can move past the fact  that the mime in question is pictured twice on the cover of the video, and  thus actually place the tape in their VCR, are in for a treat. Children of  Paradise is a nice juicy epic, with an amazing recreation of the  mid-Nineteenth century Paris theatre district. The plot revolves around  Garance, a woman surrounded by men who are drawn to her, including yes, the  mime, a mockery of a performer, until he is inspired by her beauty.
Other  men, dastardly, flamboyant, rich, all vie for her heart, but it is the mime  whose heart is true. O! Unrequited love! More mimery ensues, but the mime  does have the decency to take his makeup off for some of his more complex  scenes with Garance.
The film neatly divides into two acts, but the  consequences of a few words and gestures in the first act are devastating  to the viewer when the second act rolls around.
I wholeheartedly  recommend this film to lovers of classic films, and, of course, to any  prospective mimes.",969235200,7,1404,4.638211382113822
526308,5,6302969603,"Film Review by Jim Richardson
 First published in ""Der Stump""  7/16/75
GREATEST FILM EVER MADE
The greatest film ever made is  director Marcel Carne's ""The Children of Paradise"" with script by  Jacques Prevert. It's hard to say more.
But I will.
 :-)
In Paris of the 1840's on Le Boulevard du Crime, Carne's camera soars  through sideshow entertainments of every description. The motion picture  has just begun. No characters introduced. Already the audience is gasping,  dizzy, lost in a swirl of romantic imagery. We are inside a theatre sharing  the cheapest seats in the last row of the top balcony near the ceiling with  the ""children of paradise."" We forget ourselves and any notion  that a film has to be ""realistic"" as we float along catching  Carne's glimpse of this lost, fantastic era. The movie moves. It overflows  with art and intelligence; we are totally under its spell of romance and  beauty.
As the story unfolds, we watch it in a daze. There is  suffering and sudden death. But no leaden hand is telling us this is a  stylized allegory dealing with the paralysis of an occupied France. This is  the kind of film people make when they may die tomorrow: we are compelled  to receive it on the edge of our seat, every nerve tingling with desperate  anticipation. We don't need to know that it was made between 1943-45 when  some of the filmmakers were being hunted by the Gestapo, that starving  extras stole banquets before they could be photographed.

Every  movement the performers make is studied, made perfect as though this would  be the last time any of them were to act. Garbo interests you? Meet  Arletty. The ideal twentieth century woman. Witty. Controlled. Passionate.  When she comes to her lover she glides toward the camera, walking without  the use of her feet. Impossible? Not this time.
Jean-Louis Barrault  playing Baptiste Debureau, the greatest French mime who created Pierrot (a  pale, love-sick, ever-hopeful seeker after happiness) -- Barrault  transcends the man's legend with elegant pathos. And the way he moves. Like  a feather. How did he learn that?
The man who taught him plays his  father in the film. As a matter of fact, Etienne Decroux taught Marcel  Marceau as well. What does Decroux think of Marceau's popular mime? Snarls,  ""Walt Disney!""
Mime is serious to Decroux. At some of his  performances if the audience interrupts with applause, he is insulted and  immediately retires from the stage!
In the film, we see Barrault do  many of Decroux's mime exercises during moments of Debureau's performances.  Does Decroux think this is a good film? It is said that when he views it,  tears run down his cheeks as he mouths all the lines.
But the film  is not just about mime. Pierre Brasseur plays the most renowned romantic  actor in France, Frederick LeMaitre. Decroux doesn't want him in his mime  company at first because it's so obvious that ""he's an actor.""  Frederick gets his break when he mocks a playwright by turning the man's  melodrama into a farce. Years pass and both actor and mime become  successful. But the actor cannot play ""Othello"" because he is so  vain nothing can make him feel jealousy. That's right: Arletty cures him!
And there are aristocrats, and murderers, and thieves. And the film  is over three hours long without a break. And you will be surprised how  fast those three hours disappear!
You will be overcome with a  feeling of ecstasy; you will sigh, you will cry. And as your breath is  taken away you will be left with so much you never knew before, that you  always thought existed; something will have happened to you for the first  time, and forever. Now is the time to fall in love with the best there is!",966297600,9,3696,4.7674050632911396
526309,5,6302969603,"Once upon a time, in a world far different from ours, everyone could afford to attend the theater and opera.  In that far different world, there were two kinds of theater and opera patrons.  First, there were the wealthy  who often attended the theater to ""see and be seen"" and then  there were the poor who attended to enjoy every aspect of the spectacle.  People in this latter category were the ""regulars"" who pushed and  jostled to claim their cheap upper balcony seats, and it was they, through  their boisterous cheers and jeers, who made or broke a theatrical  offering.
These denizens of the upper balconies are ""the children of  paradise"" of this title.  In mid nineteenth century France, the term,  as used by members of the theatre company, was generally a term of  affection.  In the present movie, the term serves to set the  scene.
CHILDREN OF PARADISE (LES ENFANTS DU PARADIS in French) has as its  focal point, Garance, a femme fatale, who is loved by four men who each  love her in a different way.
First there is Duberau, a mime-actor who  idolizes Garance and loves her in an almost sacred manner.
Second there  is Lemaitre, a stage tragedian who loves Garance in a carnal way.
Third  there is Lacenaire, a failed playwright and gangster who loves Garance, as  much as he is able, as a skeptical friend.
Fourth there is Count de  Mournay who loves Garance in a possessive way, but agonizes over the fact  that his love is not returned.
If one can call a love relationship  involving three people the eternal triangle, I suppose that you could call  this the eternal pentagon.
The five characters weave in and out of one  another's lives, always within the the framework of the world of  mid-nineteenth century Paris show business.  The fact that this movie was  filmed under the supervision of the Gestapo censors in World War II France,  with some scenes being shot secretly, and with some of the actors being  hunted by the Gestapo, makes its escapist theme all the more  surprising.
One scene, early in the movie, stands out in my memory.  It  is the mime scene where Dubreau, played by Jean-Louis Barrault, gives the  police a description of a street theft, all in mime.  Because of this  silent testimony, the police release Garance, who had been their primary  suspect.
I enjoyed this film and wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to any  thoughtful movie-goer.  It is not, however, going to appeal to the type of  movie-goer who needs an explosion a minute to keep his attention and  interest.",964569600,17,2516,4.7050691244239635
526310,5,6302969603,"When I went to Acting School at NYU, the Movement teacher assigned this movie as a study in gestures and wordless expression.  I was and still am completely spellbound by Barrault's mime. And I am NOT a fan of mimes.  But  his skill and his bare emotions win anyone over. And that is just the tip  of the wonderful iceburg called ""Children of Paradise"".  A love  story, many broken hearts, oh- the humanity! but truly and sincerely, you  feel for each of the complex and multi-dimensional characters. No small  parts here for there are no small actors.  This movie is a must for young  and old, male and female - anyone with a heart.",961113600,4,633,4.473684210526316
526311,5,6302969603,"Children of Paradise is, quite simply, the best film ever made.  It's one of those strange, lyrical movies that must be seen at exactly the right time in life, or its true meaning is elusive.  The story works on many  levels -- what IS this about? Paris? Life? The Theater? Thumbing one's nose  at the Nazis? Thumbing one's nose at Arletty? Yes. But mostly, it's about  the timelessness of Love and all it entails.  It's about pain and  retreating into -- and out of -- dreams.  Children of Paradise is about  watching life unfold from the safety of the ""paradise"" -- the  peanut gallery, the balcony, the cheap seats. In English, the language of  this film is haunting; in French, it's sublime perfection. I saw this film  for the first time in Tulsa, Oklahoma. I was 19. I was also recovering from  a devestating head-injury which robbed me of my ability to speak French.  For the first part of Children of Paradise, I struggled with subtitles.  Then something magical happened: I understood. ""I dreamed. I hoped. I  waited."" Universal.  Children of Paradise is not for everyone. It's a  film of the heart -- raw and powerful.  On the surface, the imagery is  nothing special -- but combined with the meaning of Prvert's words, it's a  force to be reckoned with. This film is nothing short of a masterpiece.",944870400,114,1309,4.6535087719298245

The leitmotiv of the ragman and the poetry of his words intrigues me.  I studied French theatre and French film  and found so much of interest in this film.",943488000,3,267,4.617021276595745
526313,5,6302969603,"As a child I saw ""The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari"" on PBS and at that point realized that film can be powerful and true art....then there is the standard American ""forget it as soon as you leave the  theater"" movie.  Children of Paradise ranks right there with movies  such as Citizen Kane.
I first saw ""Les Enfants"" in a large  screen theater when I was 14.  I was amazed by the film and understood many  levels of the first half of the film.  I saw the film again in a theater  when I was about 20 and understood the lessons of life found in the second  half of the film.
Although not always possible, if you have not seen the  film yet you should see it on the big screen rather than on your home  television screen.
I searched for years to obtain a video copy and found  that the legal ownership rights for video had yet to be determined but I  could rent a 16mm version of the film.  Only in say the last 7-8 years has  it been available in video.
There are a couple publications of the script  which can be very insightful if you don't speak French.  In the 16mm film  version some of the scenes are overexposed and the white subtitles become  impossible to read.
After all these years, it still is my favorite film.  It deals with personalities, philisophies, and of course love and love  lost.  You may find yourself relating to these French folk!  ;)",940550400,5,1355,4.2896825396825395

7832748,5,6302969603,"This is France's version of ""Gone with the Wind.""  A lush, larger-than-life epic, told in a formal and lyrical style, this film follows the lives of four men who all love Garance (performed by Arletty) more or less in vain.

I have never enjoyed mimes -- not even Marcel Marceau.  But Jean-Louis Barrault's mime, the lovelorn Baptiste, is sublime -- at times balletic in his grace and witty in his movements.

Marcel Herrand's villain, Lacenaire, is the epitome of an oily, mustachioed hiss-the-villain type, performed in the grand poetic realism which preceded the more realistic acting style of Jean Gabin.

And Louis Salou epitomizes all that is truly noble in a French aristocrat.

If you value classic French films, please add this luminous masterpiece to your collection.",1503014400,2,777,5.078740157480315
