4441975,5,B004OYRDEY,"Bring it on Amitabh Bachchan and move over Shahrukh Khan, there is a new modern stud in town, Ramayana in the internet sensation Sita Sings the Blues. It is easy to sit down and fall beneath the spell of the animated multi media film. However the strung together story that switches between the modern day and the ancient past is more then the Powder Puff girls 20 centuries ago. The film takes on an old popular Indian epic legend and stirs it up creating a film that transforms the story into an Indian diaspora feminist epic narrative. Exciting for all audiences, the film takes music from Annette Hanshaw throwing the audience into a Bollywood mind set, but captured into the American past. If you want a film that is full of complex dimensions but also a film to giggle along with your friends, I suggest sitting down with the romantic tale of Sita and Rama.",1248220800,5,863,4.574193548387097
4441976,5,B004OYRDEY,"This is quite a remarkable film but a little hard to describe. It condenses the essence of the Ramayana - largely from Sita's perspective, uses Henshaw's blues music from another era, and Nina's own life story from the present time. And then there's the shadow puppet narrators. All are interwoven to tell and mutually enhance the story of failed love and redemption. It includes a wide range of animation techniques and story devices, resulting in a richness that quite surprised me.

Given that this was done by one person over an extended period of time is remarkable. Glad to see she's resolved the unexpected challenges of  music ownership.

While the HD film is available for download online, it's rather difficult when its slightly larger than the maximum file size Windows XP can handle. (laughs)  Glad it's now available on DVD. Here's hoping this work gets the coverage it deserves.",1248048000,2,892,4.966442953020135
4441977,5,B004OYRDEY,"A film of amazing emotional depth , Sita Sings the Blues is not merely animated personal mythology. The film combines the creative talents of cartoonist Nina Paley with a selection of (what are now) standards from the 1920's Blues singer Annette Hanshaw (think Bessie smith without the lugubriousness) and some honest pictorial rendering of the Indian myth ""The Ramayana"".

Sita Sings the Blues is Pre-Cinema. If much of today's Hollywood film scripting owes itself to comic books, this film fits easily within the creative embryo of the genre and produces a minimalist ,illustrated video comic that blends disparate audio and visual styles with a narrative personal mythology , so original that it is capable of influencing a whole genration of artists  and filmmakers.

Sita's story (the Ramayana is a very well known tale and Ill skip repeating the epic here) has always been the lost voice in the telling of the epic. ""The blues"" corrects this historical slight in a very satisfying way.

4441978,5,B004OYRDEY,"An incredible film, often funny, sometimes heartbreaking, always entertaining. I was impressed that such totally different elements - a tragic Hindu epic, a failed modern marriage, a 1920's blues singer and an eclectic assortment of animation styles - could all blend together so seamlessly. A must see!",1248048000,11,303,5.468085106382978
4441979,5,B004OYRDEY,"An animated musical treatment of the Ramayana full of humor and a questioning, feminist slant. Great all around. The ""sings the blues"" part of the title is from the fact that almost all of the all the singing is jazz recordings of Annette Hanshaw from the 1920's. It's almost impossible to give this film it's proper due in words. You just need to give it a try. I originally saw this film in 2008 at the Seattle International Film Festival.  Even after a year where I attended three international film festivals and saw probably 200 films it was still one of the most positively memorably things I'd seen.

I found the film laugh-out-loud funny, interesting and great to both watch and listen to. One frequent filmgoer who'd read the Ramayana  earlier in his life mentioned that on top of really liking the film as entertainment it made many points he'd missed as a child.

There's a long interesting story about what the film maker had to go through to get this DVD released ([...]). But really all you need to know is that this is food stuff, creative story telling, great music, and many laugh out loud moments. Did I mention the flying monkeys?

You can even view this as a companion piece to Religulous given it's ever present skeptical Greek chorus that goes along for the ride. Like animation? - it's got that. Don't like animation? - you'll be laughing too hard to notice. Want a sad story of modern love gone wrong - check. The only thing this film hasn't had going for it was guarantee that you'd be able to see it off the festival circuit. Now that this problem is solved there are no more excuses.",1248048000,3,1610,4.537931034482758
4441980,4,B004OYRDEY,"I had the pleasure of checking out the film at a Festival in New York. The animation has a unique home made, heartfelt and endearing quality. It is visually delightful. The juxtaposition of the director's contemporary, emotional journey alongside a character from hindu mythology is a remarkably difficult to execute. She pulls it of with sensitivity and transports the audience to a period in her life. The use of witty shadow puppets as narrators is fantastic and I strongly recommend the film. It is an enjoyable, mature, non-disney like use of animation which is rare. The vision is undeniable and I am looking forward to see what the filmmaker does next.",1247616000,35,659,4.945945945945946
4441981,5,B004OYRDEY,"Some films remain with us because of the story they tell on screen. Others we connect with deep in our hearts because of what the content means to us, personally. And then there are those films that are poignant because of their background, the goings-on behind the scenes, which we just happen to know about.
Nina Paley's animated feature 'Sita Sings the Blues' is a wonderful combination of all three for me. The story is based on the epic Indian tale of the 'Ramayana', focusing on the love triangle between Rama, his virtuous wife Sita and the evil Ravana who lusts after Sita and kidnaps her, for her beauty. Ravana wants to make Sita his wife, but she manages to hold out just long enough for Rama to find them and he kills Ravana in an ensuing war, aided by the monkey god Hanuman. When Sita finally finds herself back with Rama, he proceeds to doubt her virtuousness - himself guilty of that typical middle class deal breaker ""What will people think?!""
For the emotional connection, well there's the wonderfully poignant true side story of Paley's own disintegrating marriage and the effect that has on both her and her cats. As she tries to understand her husband's inexplicable behavior while dealing with their relationship long distance, she naturally morphs into the legendary heroine of the tale she is telling. And I absolutely adore her use of torch songstress Annette Henshaw - making 'Sita Sings the Blues' a due tribute to old timey musicals - and the sidekick trio of shadow puppets who are in charge of lightening up the storyline from time to time and adding their own, beautifully spoken pearls of wisdom.
Finally, it was impossible for me to forget all about the troubles Nina Paley has seen, for this film. Lets set aside for a moment her marriage breaking up, her savings all going into this arduous project and years of her life being spent trying to produce, create and find distribution for this project. But then comes the issue of copyright. Because the film contains more than a dozen songs by Ms. Henshaw, whose rights are now owned by various record companies, Paley has gone through hell and back in terms of obtaining the copyrights. But finally, we can own this gem of a film, watch it whenever we want and in the process give back to Ms. Paley for her hard work!",1247184000,4,2300,4.667487684729064
4441982,5,B004OYRDEY,"I was lucky enough to see this film at the Disney Concert Hall during a Los Angeles showing around a year ago.  I was mesmerized from the first minutes of the film.

I have to be upfront in saying that I had emailed Nina Paley, the director beforehand, and she became a blogging friend of mine. I learned about the the toils, the tribulations, and what effort she had to go through to put this film together, and the film didn't dissapoint.

The film is fantastic, with different styles of animation, good music, and the story which intertwines the lives of Sita, from the Ramayana, and Nina, the director/animator's life, is quite brilliant.

It has received many accolades, applauses, and the like...I truly recommend it to all my friends and colleagues.

Go NINA GO!",1247011200,5,769,4.708955223880597
4441983,1,B004OYRDEY,"I chanced upon the full film on Youtube and mistakenly assumed it was some random hobby project of some random hobbyist rather than a (more or less) professional attempt at a (more or less) serious cinematic work, and was initially impressed based on that misapprehension. I was also at first intrigued by the various strands, assuming that somehow they'd eventually coalesce in some satisfying manner. No such luck: If you've watched a few minutes of this, you might as well have watched the entire thing; ultimately it goes nowhere.

Essentially this is a cartoon (simplified and abbreviated) telling of the famous Indian Hindu epic the Ramayana with animated Annette Henshaw recordings interpolated and a frame story about characters named Dave and Nina and a couple of cats (cats that Dave and Nina and the film itself seem to regard as discardable). Nina, not coincidentally, is also the first name of the film-maker, Nina Paley. The only original parts are the amateurish-appearing animation and the frame story. (After all, the Ramayana itself is many centuries old, and Paley, of course, had nothing whatsoever to do with the Henshaw recordings.) The frame story is curiously threadbare. It amounts to ""Dave dumps Nina"". We aren't given a clue as to why Dave dumps Nina, but Nina wallows in self-pity and then reads the Ramayana and decides to make this film so as to revenge herself. In the Ramayana, the character Sita is also treated badly, and Sita is a beautiful goddess and a great martyr, such that Nina can glorify herself wallowing in self-pity with the extremely unconvincing parallel.

The interpolation of the Henshaw recordings into the Ramayana narrative makes a sort of cut-and-paste musical out of it. The incongruity seems at first cute but eventually becomes tedious and never makes any cogent aesthetic point. (In and of themselves the Henshaw recordings are always enjoyable, of course, but that says nothing for the film--which, as I understand it, by the way, failed to obtain legal permission to use the recordings.) The segments of the Ramayana narrative are introduced by shadow puppets representing Indians half-remembering the epic and arguing among themselves about it. This too seems cute at first but ultimately proves pointless.",1408579200,5,2267,5.1409214092140925
4441984,4,B004OYRDEY,I love the music by Annette Hanshaw. This movie definitely inspires me to be interested in learning other cultures. The commentary by the three narrators is rather hilarious.

4441985,5,B004OYRDEY,"Where Chaucer got his ""spin""!
Showed this to my book group on our annual ""film night"" with an Indian buffet. After a year long discussion on a series of books about the nature of storytelling, a perfect climax! (The story of Sita finds its way across the continents to inspire material like Chaucer's ""Patient Griselda"", and ""Babes in the Wood""). Great story telling, modern commentary, and a feast for the eyes. Very, very clever animation. Includes a nod to the theory that all folk tales found their origin as explanations for the movements of the heavenly bodies. A ""stellar"" watch!",1391212800,,586,4.87
4441986,5,B004OYRDEY,"Ms. Hanshaw's remarkable production of this ancient and living complex story continues to delight and amaze me. The animation is beautifully done. The colours are lavish.  The tunes work. It's all good. The flow of the film is perfect.

The special features are very good, in particular the interview with Ms. Hanshaw and her belief in free use.  I love the film, I love Ms. Hanshaw's work in general and I look forward to more once she digs herself out of the financial burdens caused by the production.",1390694400,,504,4.704545454545454

4441992,5,B004OYRDEY,"When I saw this at the sunshine theatre in New York City, and was able to review  it again on PBS. I was blown away by the beautiful art work, as well as the provocative story line but most of all it seemed like a trip to another heavenly planet. The colors are vivid, the art work is astonishing, the music was beautiful. I realize there is controversy about the copy rights of the music in this project but how else will anyone know about this obscure singer if Hanshaw had not introduced her style on this beautiful masterpiece. Although I do hope that detail is worked out soon so the rest of the world can have a look at ""Sita Sings the Blues."" The story was  compelling  and I recommend it to anyone who has ever been paralyzed by a broken heart. The heartache of a heartbreak is brilliantly portrayed in this gem of a film. The different styles of animation is so interesting to watch. I love this film and highly recommend it. I am so happy to have it in my collection.

4441995,5,B004OYRDEY,"Engaging and varied imagery. The animation is stunning! The combination of old blues music and Indian music is quite lively.

A clever mix of a traditional Indian tale and modern viewpoints. I particularly enjoyed the bits where several modern Indians discuss the story and add their our observations - smart, funny stuff. The author is relating this classic love story to her own breakup, but she isn't wallowing in self-pity. She uses a light hand on her own story, and the ending - I won't give it away, but it's great. If you've been done wrong, you'll relate.

If you can't get the DVD (it isn't always available), you can watch this online (legally) on the animator's site, but I find it a lot nicer to sit back and watch it on the television, particularly since this is a full length film with imagery that deserves a bigger screen.",1357516800,,839,4.624161073825503

4441998,4,B004OYRDEY,"I watched this movie on an absolute whim on Hulu. I didn't know what to expecgt and I even almost decided to just turn it off since it just looked strange. However, I'm glad I didn't. It is a bit of an awkward little film, but it's highly entertaining and quite informative as well. The little shadow people are hilarious and really keep viewers from getting too distracted. They provide nice dialogue and information about the characters and events of the Ramayana...or at least an excerpt of it.

The cartoonist that created the film goes to India to be with her husband, only to have her marriage unexpectedly fail. Meanwhile, we go back and forth to the Ramayana, where we follow the story of Rama and Sita...mostly Sita. To move the story along with a big more oddity and entertainment, the story often drops into interpretive jazz songs and crazy animation.

If you can handle the quick changes and singing every 2 minutes, it's really pretty awesome and interesting. It made me want to find a copy of the Ramayana to find out what happens to Sita after the end of the film...as it only goes up to a certain part of the story.

If you don't understand Indian culture or the epic tale, it's okay. The shadow people explain most of the important stuff for you and make it humorous so that it's easier to digest. I think this is a fascinating little piece to add to a collection, whether it be for odd movies, obscure animations/films, or even for a children's library.",1348012800,,1472,4.568181818181818
4441999,5,B004OYRDEY,"Wanted to buy the DVD to show friends, but will not pay $99 for a DVD that can be viewed online for free.  I orginally watched this on youtube for free.",1340668800,,152,3.903225806451613
4442000,5,B004OYRDEY,"I personally think this movie is a work of genius. Nina Paley, the author and animator, has somehow managed to take her personal story and expand it into a modern day epic based on (and paralleling) the Ramayana. She does so using some interesting and entertaining devices, including the main cast of characters from the Ramanaya, wayang kulit (Indonesian shadow puppets) to provide commentary explaining to non-Indian audiences some background information, and Annette Hanshaw - a 1920s jazz singer - as both an animated character and vocals to add yet another dimension to this epic tale.

The story itself is entertainment because you are treated to a visual masterpiece with some great background music from a bygone era, and dual storylines (the Ramanaya and Ms. Paley's personal story.) You also learn more than a little about Indian culture through one of their epics as depicted in an abbreviated version as part of the parallel story and further explained courtesy of the animated Indonesian shadow puppets.

Aside from the stories, soundtrack and beautiful visuals, I loved the way that the animation shifted from one visual mode to another depending on the context of a scene: Nina's personal story is depicted in almost impressionistic portrayal, while the scenes strictly from the Ramayana were lushly done in vivid colors and a lot of detail. When the scenes switched to Annette Hanshaw's singing, Sita was transformed into a more cartoon-like persona who was more tart than the wife of the seventh avatar of the God Vishnu. The shadow puppets occupied yet another visual mode. This mode switching made it easy to follow a fairly complex story - parallel stories actually - without getting lost or succumbing to losing interest. I was spellbound throughout the entire video, which lasted nearly an hour and a half.

I was so taken with this video that I've watched it eight times since discovering it. I get something new from each viewing and marvel at the kind of mind Nina has to be able to not only conceive of the story, but to knit it in with the Ramanaya, and use a relatively obscure (today) jazz singer whose heyday was over 80 years ago to provide a soundtrack of songs that are relevant to the stories.

I used to read Nina Paley's comics work and enjoyed it, so I was happy to see her make a full movie. The charming animation and art are almost all hers; rarely will you see more brilliant colors on a screen. The retelling of the Ramayana with Nina as Sita is an interesting conceit, and the fine 1920s music of Annette Harshaw makes for some unusual juxtapostions that often work well.

There's some good humor, especially from the three Indian narrators arguing over how the Ramayana goes; very nice touches abound. The movie is unpredictable in mostly enjoyable ways, and credit must be given to Paley for a truly unique work of art, made for less than 300k almost entirely by herself, a near impossible feat for a film this excellent.

Apparently there were unexpected copyright issues with the music, and Paley ended up making the movie available for free, both streaming online and from downloads
 via many sites! Now that's true devotion to the highest level of artistic altruism: making a movie by yourself and giving it away. Pretty cool. You can find the many dl sites from a search, but all in all it's nice to buy this one and give Nina some well-due payment for a very special creation which proves that truly personal art can be made personally, avoiding the bloodsucking studio system, and still reach a wide audience.

That the movie is so unique and of such special quality suggests that the next Paley movie will be given plenty of well-deserved funding.

Sita Sings The Blues is absolutely worth seeing, and if you're a woman with a cat who likes Indian history and has had problems with men, this will probably be the greatest experience of your filmgoing career.",1277424000,2,1693,4.702702702702703

4442030,5,B004OYRDEY,"The big animation houses blow through hundreds of millions of dollars on each their films, but never have and likely never will deliver the electric joy inspired by Nina Paley's masterpiece. The universe offers us only one force powerful enough to bind together the wildly disparate elements in this color-drenched musical--the epic traditions of Hindu scripture; the sweet, spicy, pungent flavor of Hinduism's kitsch art; a crinkly New Yorker-style tale of modern love on the rocks; a driving, cosmical, East-meets-West soundtrack; the fond but skeptical sound of average modern-day Indians dissecting their cultural heritage; and of course, the campy, touching torch songs of Annette Hanshaw. That irresistible force is Paley's priceless sense of artistry and humor--a huge, soft tiger's paw with its claws retracted, caressing rather than slashing its prey. This film is only a few years old, but I feel sure it is one of the greatest movies ever made. When I first saw it on the Internet, I wanted to pinch myself to see whether I only dreamed a film could be so delightful. When I saw it again in a theater, I realized that Sita may soon earn the evergreen stature of ""The Wizard of Oz."" I can think of no higher praise.",1261526400,5,1225,4.951456310679611
4442031,5,B004OYRDEY,"I don't think it's possible to lavish too much praise on this film. It represents the future of filmmaking: highly personal and wildly idiosyncratic, the singular vision of an artist in near-total control of every pixel of every frame.

Animator Nina Paley writes, directs, produces, etc., leaving only the voice acting, action animation (in one sequence) and some of the technical work to other people. As a result, the film is wonderfully unique and eccentrically eclectic. The story is actually an intertwining of four distinct threads, drawn in different styles and combining to tell one story.

The first: the ancient Indian story of Rama and Sita, told by three shadow puppets in an informal, conversational manner, including asides, arguments about pronunciation of names or lineage, and differing perceptions.

The second: a dramatization of the Rama/Sita story- animated in an elaborate, traditional style, like watching ancient Kerala murals come to life.

The third: the story of the filmmaker's failed marriage. This is the least visually impressive facet of the film, made up of rough, hand-drawn figures transposed over photographic backgrounds.

The fourth, and most beautiful set of sequences involves songs performed by 1920's jazz singer, Annette Hanshaw, sung by a vibrantly-colored, vector-graphic-animated Sita. This juxtaposition of dusty old record bin filler with the Indian motif works unexpectedly well, particularly with the stunning visuals.

There is also a fifth type of sequences utilized in the opening credits and in another segment shortly after the intermission (which features characters from the film walking off-screen and returning with popcorn boxes and sodas or emerging from an implied restroom door). This fifth set of sequences is the most dynamic and impressive, the second occurrence evoking the spirit of the opening credits of a Bond film.

I have a strong feeling this film could be due for a cult following, marked by dorm rooms full of psychonauts gaping slack-jawed at the beautiful colors, mesmerized by the rhythmic pulse of Bhangra music. This is closer to `Fantasia' than `Fantasia 2000' was.

If this film is at all indicative of what film audiences can look forward to seeing in the future, then we are all in for a real treat. As film production becomes simpler and more accessible with the rise of digital video, PCs and consumer video editing software, film becomes a medium more like the novel, musical composition or painting- something that one person can do themselves. Film has been a collaborative effort for most of its existence, and a simple survey of your own memory will prove that it is quite difficult to name 3 famous works of art created by committee. Technological advances in digital video will allow the next Picasso, Mozart or Hemingway to work in film without having the broth spoiled by too many cooks in the kitchen.",1261526400,,2899,5.206008583690987

4442037,4,B004OYRDEY,"Sita Sings the Blues combines several different styles of animation, two different but related storylines, and at least three different narrative techniques into a film about the Ramayana and male-female relationships.  The basic plot of the Ramayana, as presented in the movie, is relatively simple: the (supposedly) perfect Rama falls in love with Sita, who, Helen of Troy-like, is kidnapped by the bad guy, and after she's rescued (by the monkey god Hanuman and his pals), Rama doubts her purity.  Interwoven with this is the film maker's own story of rejection by her mate.

The Ramayana storyline is presented by three interwoven series of segments: a group of extremely funny narrators who grew up with the epic in India describe the story as it progresses, followed by the next section of the story itself, followed by a song sung by 1920s singer Annette Hanshaw illustrating a theme of the story segment, then back to the funny narrators, and so on.  The contemporary story of rejection is interwoven through this.

How successful is all of this?  First, we have to acknowledge that the film maker did virtually all of it herself on a shoe string budget without a lot of prior experience, and she deserves tremendous credit.  The narrators are, as I've said, very, very funny--I could easily have sat through entire film of their bantering. Some of the animation is dazzling. However, I didn't care for the Hanshaw songs, which are all in the same style, and illustrated with very static and unimaginative animation, like Betty Boop but without any of the real Betty Boop's incredibly creative animation.  Since there are about a dozen of these songs, every seven minutes or so, there's another one.  After the first couple of songs, I dreaded them--they add little to the film unless you really love Hanshaw's singing style. I also was a little puzzled by the storyline about the film maker's own rejection; I could see how someone going through it might analogize to some view of the Ramayana, but there really isn't as much overlap as we're apparently supposed to think.  The film maker's rejection is blunt and unexplained, while the reasons for Rama's doubting Sita are far more subtle; we can say he was just a jerk but that seems more than a little simplistic.

On the whole, definitely worth seeing, with some great sections, but uneven.",1255996800,2,2353,4.9017632241813605

4442040,5,B004OYRDEY,"SITA SINGS THE BLUES is a marvel of imagination and ingenuity.  An animated film that has very low production values, yet every frame drips with inspiration.  The term ""labor of love"" is thrown around a great deal...but when you see this film (and if you understand a little of its background)...you remember what the clich&eacute; was meant for.

Writer/director/animator/editor/designer/etc. Nine Paley went through a traumatic and abrupt breakup a few years ago.  Left adrift in NYC, she found strength in the old Indian tales of THE RAMAYANA, particularly the character of Sita.  She was the wife of a most noble Indian ruler...a man with a mighty reputation who nonetheless treated his devoted and faithful wife horribly.  I won't provide more details, but suffice it to say that Paley drew some parallels between the treatment Sita received and her own.

Yet at the same time, Paley also was inspired by the `20s era Blues of Annette Hanshaw, a legendary singer...a singer whose music should have no place in the story of Sita in about 1000 B.C. and Paley herself in current times.  Yet what Paley has imagined is a beautiful melding of those three elements, in animated form...thereby creating a work that would have been hugely diminished had any 3 elements been missing.  If Sita did not frequently burst into song (using the voice and tunes of Hanshaw) a richness of feeling would have been lost (to say nothing of reintroducing Hanshaw's singular talent to a new audience).  If the modern part of the story had been left out, the effort would have felt like a quaint look at a dusty old story, without any modern resonance.  And so on.

So, yes, SITA SINGS THE BLUES was crafted almost totally by Paley herself.  She received excellent voice-over work, but otherwise, she put the whole thing together herself.  While one might argue that she didn't compose the music (a critical element) one could say that just the fact that she chose to use it in the manner she did showed immense creativity.

As with many ancient folk stories, there are many versions of Sita's story.  Also, the motivations of the characters in myths often seem arbitrary or, frankly, unmotivated.  Paley takes on this problem directly, through the use of three very funny narrators who clearly disagree on the facts of their story and who can only theorize on why Sita or her husband or others acted the way they did.  This acknowledgement that the ancient story has its holes becomes not only an amusing device, but it is a commentary of the very nature of story-telling and shared mythology.

The animation is ""crude"" by the standards of today...but Paley, working mostly on a personal computer, makes up for the lack of technical wizardry by fully utilizing the tools she DID have at her disposal.  And she uses several very distinct styles during the different portions of her story...and this very jumpiness in style becomes a storytelling element.

I have deliberately left out all but the barest suggestion of the plot itself.  To me, the plot is not as important as the journey.  We see Sita and her husband banished for 14 years from the palace of his father, their humble but happy time together in the forest, Sita's kidnapping at the hands of the ruler of Lanka (now Sri Lanka) and all the adventures that follow.  Sita occasionally speaks her mind, but most often, expressed herself through Hanshaw's songs.  Juxtaposed throughout is Nina's story of a happy life in San Francisco, brought to an end when her guy gets a job in India.  While the stories are charming, it is again the style and the passion that makes SITA SINGS THE BLUES a unique experience.

There are minor problems.  A few of the ""numbers"" Sita sings feel a tad repetitious, as though we've covered very similar ground before.  The film ends more abruptly than it needs to...frankly, to fully understand the modern portion of the story, you need to know that it is autobiographical.  That ""ah ha"" realization adds the final touch to the film...but you don't get unless you do some additional research.  (The DVD extras MIGHT address this...I don't know, though, because I saw the film in a theater.)

And while there is little objectionable material in the film, I suspect that young children would find it quite boring indeed (as evidenced by some squirmy kids sitting a row over from me).  Yet for older teens and adults with an adventurous spirit, SITA SINGS THE BLUES is a way to capture some of the feeling we had as kids when we saw an animated film take us to places we could barely imagine.  It's a charming and original mini-masterpiece.  4.5 stars.",1251676800,5,4622,4.8002528445006325

4442042,5,B004OYRDEY,"Nina's film is funny and treats the whole thing with a much needed lightness of touch - I just watched ""Les Demoiselles de Rochefort"" (also available at Amazon) - one of Jacques Demi's trio of bizarre, but highly enjoyable musicals, which has a similar lightness of touch but has a basically banal storyline (as does ""Umbrellas of Cherbourg"") centred on relationships.

One of the things lost in a lot of Ramayana adaptations (deliberately in order to underline the characters divinity) is this lightness - these are people we can barely identify with and the scale is always ""EPIC"" - but while Demi manages to turn the banal into something epic, Nina has turned the epic into something banal,& what they have in common is accessibility.

The other common factor is the independant spirit - Demi's films never spawned a culture of musical films in France and are considered unique in French cinema - I wouldn't even class him with the other New Wave film makers of his generation.

In the same way, Nina's film is a stand-out effort which cleverly captures the essence of a timeless story in a very contemporary, up to date, digital animation form, while retaining the economy of the folk art traditions which partially inspire it.

The animation is heavily and pleasantly stylized and it makes you wish this was a TV series.  It's just FUN.

The music is toe-tappingly addictive and you'll find yourself wishing you could easily just put all the songs on your MP3 player.

You'll laugh, you'll get emotionally involved, you'll wish you could shake the woman (who is from mythology and we're not used to thinking of those types of people as *people*) and tell her to be stronger and value herself more, you'll wish you could shake the woman (wait, I said that, though it's only kinda the same woman), and you'll find you're trying to get friends and loved ones to watch this.

It's fricking awesome.  In the old sense of the word.  Watch it already.  It's free online, somewhere, since it was kickstartered at one point.  .....but I'm buying the DVD.  Hell, I'm talking about it at work and trying to get the plebs to give it a chance because even THEY will love it.  Love.  It.  You will too.",1505606400,,1168,4.4739336492890995
8437366,2,B004OYRDEY,"This is a movie that gets in the top 10 animated movies because it is considered to be so weird and so unique that there is nothing to compare to it. While there are few movies like it, ultimately the movie does not live up to its reputation. There are basically three interconnected parts and only one part is worth viewing.

1. A group of Indian sounding people debate a story in the Ramayana where Rama and Sita fall in love but Rama doesn't trust Sita and things go badly even though Sita is the model of virtue. They sound academic in their discussions, but mostly this is just the movie equivalent of tiresome college debates. This is the part of the movie that got the most protests as the Hindu community felt like Rama was being mocked and certainly there is an element of smug westerner in this depiction. Not certain if these protests are valid or not but regardless, these scenes might as well come with a sign stating ""Oh look at me! I'm so smart because I can talk about Ramayana!"" So this part is tedious.

2. Nina depicts herself in the way that she used to depict herself in her 90s independent comics with the frazzled hair and the wry San Francisco outlook. Her husband leaves to take a job in India. She tries to follow but it doesn't work out. She whines a lot and as a member of the audience, you are supposed to feel sympathy for rich white people who can take off to India without much of a thought and then settle in hipster Brooklyn to infect the neighborhood with their gentrification. I suspect that I might be less harsh to this part of the movie if it weren't for Nina Paley's personality which is obnoxious in the movie but even worse in real life. Call it the Roman Polanski/Woody Allen dilemma. Is it fair to allow the artist's terrible ideas and personality color your view of the artist's work? If the movie doesn't make a point of being transphobic, why should that matter when watching the movie? I don't know. These scenes didn't do it for me, but I suspect I would give them the benefit of the doubt if I had not read the author's blog.

3. Sita as a big eyed cartoon figure singing 1920s jazz standards as a way of communicating her inner life. These are the scenes that are beautiful and get all the praise. They are fun and they a nice cross-cultural standard. The one caveat of these scenes is the fact that the music is still copyrighted and Nina Paley's response to criticism (also lawsuits) is to make the whole movie public domain and claim that she doesn't believe in copyright law. She even has a youtube song called ""Copying is not theft"" that was popular when SOPA debates were raging. While it might be laudable to believe that copyright is so outdated that she is not even going to benefit from copyright, she is still ripping off the family of the original singer. In Pirke Avos there is a passage that talks about the four ways you can combine what is yours is mine and it states that one who states that what is mine is yours and what is yours is yours is a saint. However, one who states that what is yours is mine and what is mine is yours is just meshuggas. You can't take someone's bike under the rubric that that person is free to take anything that you own. Making a big show of stating that property is an illusion and intellectual property is even more a fantasy does not mean that you are clear.

So anyhow this might be worth a viewing, but get it from one of those free sites as Nina Paley is cool with everyone watching her stuff for nothing. But don't buy it.",1501372800,,3528,4.349013657056146

Secondly, the creator place the work, except for some of the copyright protected music, in the public domain, and it is available for free download, or, in DVD format for $20 with multiple subtitle sets and cool special features.  If you want to spend money for this work, give it to the artist through its web page where you can get the DVD at a low price.

Absolutely beautiful and creative film.  The story, the treatment, the animation, and the soundtrack are all incredible and match and support each other incredibly.  Nina Paley put together something truly beautiful, in an original retelling of a timeless and, in some ways, universal, classic.",1410480000,,696,4.864406779661017
