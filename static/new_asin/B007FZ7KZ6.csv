8516099,3,B007FZ7KZ6,"Fans of Fred Olen Ray's previous cheapskate boob opera, Bikini Airways, will probably like this opus. A down on his luck stage hypnotist and his assistant move away from their psychic parlor to a mansion in Beverly Hills he inherited from his rich aunt. Here he hypnotises as many women as he can to have sex with him. I could add an extra star if the DVD had an option to view the movie without hypno vision where a mood-destroying caption flashes on the screen for a split second during the movie's best parts. Obviously Ray was spoofing William Castle movies that often contained gimmicks like Emergo and Smell-o-Vision.",1337731200,,623,4.724770642201835
