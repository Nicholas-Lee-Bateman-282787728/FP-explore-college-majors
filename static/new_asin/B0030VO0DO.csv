4047053,5,B0030VO0DO,"This 3-disc collection is worth the price. THE SKULL is a wonderfully gothic Peter Cushing / Christopher Lee vehicle w/ the eeevil, murderous SKULL (once belonging to the shoulders of the Marquis De Sade himself!) of the title. THE MAN WHO COULD CHEAT DEATH has Lee again, this time pitted against the immortal Anton Diffring, who must kill in order to live. The beautiful Hazel Court also stars. THE DEADLY BEES is a ridiculous yarn about killer honeybees on a rampage in a small village. Watch for the god-awful cropped-in bees as they swarm and sting! These hilarious ""special"" effects add to the overall dumb charm of this buzz-fest. All in all, a fantastic triple feature!...",1322956800,5,680,4.870689655172414
4047054,5,B0030VO0DO,"Hello,

I have enjoyed these movies over and over.  They are old fashioned movies with out all of the smut and ghetto talk that movies of today have.  Sit back and enjoy.  Thanks.",1309910400,4,179,4.333333333333333
4047055,3,B0030VO0DO,"The man who could cheat death is the stand out, killer bees was mildly entertaining and a bit better than expected, while the skull is less than was expected with its quality cast.

No complaints about the disc quality.
Scant extras if any. No subs.

The man who could cheat death, very interesting. 3 views

The Skull I'm a big fan of Cushing and Lee, but I could care less if I saw this one again. 1 view

Killer bees, passable entertainment a bit patchy, so I'm most likely going to watch it again, but I give it 1 view. I have watched killer bees again and its better the second time around mostly for its excellent framing devices which are classic hammer style. It begins with the main actress doing a lip sync for a television broadcast, when she faints dead away the music continues ironically the lyrics are ""stop the music!"". Casting could have been better, the old guy is too young and has some hasty makeup.",1298764800,3,919,4.420118343195266
4047056,3,B0030VO0DO,"These films had all been previously released by Legend individually and here they are grouped together as a bargain. But what that means is they are stacked without their individual casings. Mine came with a small foam piece I guessed was meant to ""protect"" them.  This is not a good way to preserve discs of films you'd like to keep. They're too easily damaged. As far as the films are concerned, this is a good collection of British horror films. ""The Skull"" and the rarely seen ""Man Who Could Cheat Death"" being the standouts. The prints and sound are fine with the exception being ""Man Who Could Cheat Death"" which has the opening sequence too dark as the clearly bright titles roll over it, then the rest of the film is clear and nice if with somewhat muted colors. Overall, a good print of a fine film that could use remastering. If you like all three films, I'd suggest buying them seperately for safety reasons. But if you just want to save money, then this could be the way to go. Enjoy.",1274832000,8,996,4.472527472527473

8386157,5,B0030VO0DO,This set far exceeded my expectations. Making this a three-disc set to have each movie on one disc is appreciated. The copies were crisp and clean and the transaction was smooth and extremely professional.,1489449600,,205,5.0588235294117645

8386159,5,B0030VO0DO,"Even though I'm obtaining these three pictures on Blu ray , I'm keeping this nifty set and here's why . While The Man Who Could Cheat Death & The Skull are available as a Blu ray twofer and the Blu ray for The Deadly Bees will be released later this month , none of the Blu's has subtitles or closed captions . If you're fortunate enough to have this swell set , I'd certainly advise keeping it for this simple reason alone . Neat insert card too .",1444521600,,448,4.1022727272727275

8386161,5,B0030VO0DO,"This is a totally delightful collection of classic cult films brought together in one set for your entertainment--and it does entertain! Hard to take these old films too seriously, and an example was the horrible bunch of bees that are attempting to terrorize a village-sort of reminded me of Hitchcock's The Birds. You will have fun with this one-highly recommended and a new addition to your Halloween DVD collection.",1395619200,,419,5.086956521739131
