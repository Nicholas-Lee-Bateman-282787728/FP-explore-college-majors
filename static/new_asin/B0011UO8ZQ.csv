3069396,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"Yea!!  I cannot wait for the release of Season 3 of Hart to Hart.  What's taking so long?

I will purchase this the very day it is released!

Hart to Hart is one of the greatest shows of all time, and season 3 has many great highlights.  I cannot wait to watch these once more!",1199836800,6,277,3.963636363636364
3069397,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"I just loved season 3 of Hart To Hart. My favorite episods are: Hart Of Darkness - where Jonathan loses his sight, Blue and Broken Harted - where Jonathan & Jennifer pretend they are divorcing, and Harts Under Glass - where Jennifer is kidnapped and they both end up in a glass cage that Jonathan must cut their way out of. Let's hope the release date is near or at least not too far away. I can't wait to get this!",1199836800,21,415,4.135802469135802
3069398,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"""Hart of Darkness"", ""Blue and Broken Hearted and ""Harts Under Glass"" being 3 of my favorites. The show really hit its stride in season 3, showcasing the romantic, comedic and dramatic talents of its stars Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers.

Hopefully the release date is not far off!",1199836800,36,283,4.895833333333333

The closed captions on season 1 and 2 worked ok.  Season 3 closed captions are scrambled and not readable.  So, if you are Hearing-Impaired like myself, don't get this season.

Note:  Closed Captions and Subtitles are different technology.  Closed Captions will not work on an HDMI connected DVD player.  But, that is not this problem.  Season 3 just has screwed-up Closed Captions and no English subtitles.",1427414400,2,554,4.808510638297872

3069643,5,B0011UO8ZQ,Great Season 3. Long awaited for the Hart Series to finally get the missing seasons released. Great picture & sound with many great episodes in this season. Stephanie Powers & Bob Wagner shine in this series: they were perfectly cast together for these roles. They always pull it off in every show. Great home entertainment.  You will probably never see this type of show filmed like this in today's time.  2 more seasons to go & the 8 movies filmed after this show went off the air are already available on DVD separately or in 2-4 pack movie sets. A must have series.,1424563200,,569,4.514563106796117

3069670,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"I've been waiting YEARS for this... after watching seasons 1 and 2 over and over, I am thrilled to have season 3 (and now season 4, too). There are some really classic, amazing episodes of Hart to Hart in this season. Lots of adventure, excitement, camp, comedy and romance, and great location shots from all over Los Angeles. The picture and sound quality are excellent, and the episodes are complete and unedited. One minor annoying thing is that both Amazon and Shout Factory state the discs are full screen, when in fact they are pillar boxed (at least on my system - the wide black bands on either side of the picture). I can alleviate this by changing my TV settings to make the image full screen, but it's a little annoying to do this every time I watch H2H. The discs themselves are bare-bones - no special features or subtitles, if you are wanting such things. Personally I'm thrilled that this was even released, and very happy with the overall quality. I'm already on season 4 and am looking forward to the final season, fingers crossed!",1423872000,,1048,4.609625668449198

3069675,4,B0011UO8ZQ,"First things first, I must say the video quality is top notch.  Then, it starts to go down hill.  Annoyance number 1:  opening theme.  No one has mentioned this, but on every episode on my dvds, the opening theme jumps roughly in.  Hard to explain but Sony's releases were correct, you hear the horn sound and then see the Hart jet.  This release roughly opens playing horn and showing closer view of Hart jet at the same time.  It just seems cheap like Sound Factory couldn't spare the extra one second of video.  Annoyance number two is the full screen showing  (it doesn't show black bars as some of the youngsters claim - full screen is not wide screen, therefore the sides of the screen are not light up ).  Where the Sony releases automatically display in wide screen even though filmed in full screen, this Shout Factory release does not.  I found a work around for this by going to my TVs wide setting and choosing stretch.  It fills up the entire wide screen.  It's just annoying to do this every time I watch Hart to Hart because it zooms in too close for other DVDs.  I hope that Shout Factory will add a little more quality to the Season 4 release.  However, even with the faults, I am glad to have season 3 and now 4 released.  All we need is 5 :)",1423612800,2,1260,4.297872340425532

3069758,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"This recent release from Shout! of Hart to Hart season 3 (1981-82) was, IMO, well worth the wait, as it continued the releases of one of the greatest shows I've ever seen; I was beginning to wonder prior to Shout!'s acquisition whether we would ever get any more. Sure, I was happy with having two seasons' worth of it (1979-81) from Sony (Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers really made this show with their very believable romance and marriage as Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, and Lionel Stander did his part with his 1983 Golden Globe-winning role of Max, the butler/majordomo/overall helper, who, it was said, was more family than an employee), but when you have a long dry spell between releases of your favorite shows, while the shows you strongly dislike pump out release after release, it wears on you. Kudos to Shout! for picking up the mantle, and here's hoping for another top-flight release in Season 4 (1982-83).",1421366400,4,921,4.8354430379746836

Stefanie Powers was charming and attractive and held her role down and the same with Max who was the hired hand however he was more like family.  to me this is cool White People on tv. ain't been what i call Chic since the 80's.,1421280000,,426,4.0476190476190474

Eleven of the episodes do have the correct theme music, but the ending theme sounds warped.

A word of caution to potential buyers. This release from Shout Factory  does not show you the full picture on your TV screen as does the first 2 seasons  from Sony.
You will see a vertical black line either side of your screen. Even trying to adjust your TV screen from 16.9 to another setting will not work.

3069915,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"As many of the reviewers have already said, why won't Sony release any further seasons of Hart to Hart?

I'll tell you why.  It's because the DVD industry is now run by 20-30 year olds who seem to think that: (1) nobody over the age of 35 exists; (2) anyone who IS over the age of 35 can't work a DVD player; (3) why would anyone be interested in anything made prior to the year 2000?; (4) why would anyone watch a series with no preening blonde 20 something who spends every episode worrying about whether the hero will still fancy her by the time credits roll; (5) why are there no zombies/vampires/CGI in at least one episode of the run?; (6) why should a series with the main stars being over the age of 30 have any appeal to anyone? (7) the only reason anyone would want to buy a dusty old 1980s series on dvd is if someone's about to mount a remake film or tv series so that anyone under the age of 30 where the Harts would most likely be 20-something lottery-millionaire/X Factor winners who ""made it big"", and viewers will seek out the 80s version purely out of curiosity [and YouTube has probably gone into meltdown].

The evidence?  Just look at what happened to the tv series ""Fame"".  DVD is hungry to release FILMS, so they release the original 1980 version.  oooo! someone asks about the tv series, so season 1 comes out.  Years go by - no sign of any more until ..... a remake of the film filled with the latest crop of teens and 20 somethings.  Yayyy!!  Season 2 of the tv series gets released.  And then what????  NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!  We might get season 3 in about 25 years time when ANOTHER remake of ""Fame"" comes out.

Sony is sitting on a vast mountain of excellent tv material, a lot of which is far superior to the image-conscious, shallow rubbish that passes for much of today's television output (some good series excepted, there are a few, but NOT ENOUGH!).

Sony needs to review its employment policy and put some of us 40/50 somethings in charge of the archive-to-dvd department.  Then we'll show today's teens what QUALITY TELEVISION was all about in our youth.

Sony (and MGM) tv execs should hang their heads in shame.",1328659200,88,2148,4.455242966751918

I have so many fond memories of watching this show, and the best episode ever was the first of Season 5, where we finally got the backstory on how they met, got married, etc. This show was one of the few that actually showed a man and wife romantically, passionatly in love, and since all the other old TV shows are being brought back on DVD, WHY NOT OURS!!!!!

3070009,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"SONY, everytime a TV-Series on DVD is late or canceled its Sony!! They cancel all Series which are not as lucrative(pretended) as they had to be in their eyes. Chutzpah, thats the right expression!

I think of Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers at the Graham Norton Show, a few weeks ago, and their statement of Season 3, RJ said: Season 3 should be released soon, but until now nothing happens.
SONY seems not to be impressed by that or by us, the Fans. This company should no longer be able to get any rights for TV-Series on DVD. If they don't want to do more publishing with eg ""The Nanny"" or ""Hart to Hart"" on DVD, why don't they sell the rights to another company so they can publish then. Its a shame, we cant complete our DVD Collection, so SONY come on, listen what we, the Fans, want and release Hart to Hart to final.",1224633600,13,827,4.301282051282051

I watched every episode what seems like a million times, I even used to sneak downstairs and watch it when it was also on really late (I later found out my parents knew)

The best part of the show was the chemestry between RJ and SP ( as someone said ) They don't make shows like this anymore, now we are stuck with reality TV ( Which is cheaper to produce )

This show was total class. I look forward to seeing the next 3 seasons.

Come on SONY!!!!!!!!",1218153600,3,578,4.142857142857143

3070048,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"hart to hart is the greatest show ever ever, it was perfect, the cast with the wonderfull rj wagner and stephanie powers, have you ever seen chemestry like that, perfection, and the house, the cars, max and of course freeway.
i bought two copys of the first season, it was by mistake, but im not complainin, and gobbet up season two as soon as it was awailable.
they do not make shows like this any more, the eighties were magic, and it can not be recreated, sony please release season 3 asap, and hurry up with seasons 4 and 5 allready,
hart to hart is classy show about married couple jennifer and jonathan hart, he is a self made millionaire(this is the 80-ies folks,when a million bucks was a lot of money.
they live in a wonderfully cosy house in bel air(house shown in the exterior shots were owned by june allyson ang dick powell, rj visited the house as a young man and loved it, a little trivia)
with houseman and familymember max and their dog freeway(soo cute)
basically, they live a glamerous life amoung the rich and the wealthy, every episode is an independent story, were they walk into a murder or mystery, witch they solve while still looking wondefull and keeping their cool.
i do not have a favorite episode, they are all great,i can only think of a couple of episodes that bored me, the show kept up a wonderfull standard, even though both rjw and sp had their own personal tragedies during the shows run, you would never have guessed it, only proves how proffessional actors they are,
in my mind, and this probobly sounds silly, jennifer and johnathan are still around somewere, at their house, at a party or at their boat ""romance"" solving crimes and being fabolous.
there are a few shows that actually makes the world a nicer place to be, and hart to hart is on the top of that list

I was so excited when season 1 and then season 2 were released on DVD and bought them immediately.

The closed captions on season 1 and 2 worked ok.  Season 3 closed captions are scrambled and not readable.  So, if you are Hearing-Impaired like myself, don't get this season.

Note:  Closed Captions and Subtitles are different technology.  Closed Captions will not work on an HDMI connected DVD player.  But, that is not this problem.  Season 3 just has screwed-up Closed Captions and no English subtitles.",1427414400,2,554,4.808510638297872

Stephanie Powers & Bob Wagner shine in this series: they were perfectly cast together for these roles. They always pull it off in every show. Great home entertainment.  You will probably never see this type of show filmed like this in today's time.  2 more seasons to go & the 8 movies filmed after this show went off the air are already available on DVD separately or in 2-4 pack movie sets.

3304167,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"I've been waiting YEARS for this... after watching seasons 1 and 2 over and over, I am thrilled to have season 3 (and now season 4, too). There are some really classic, amazing episodes of Hart to Hart in this season. Lots of adventure, excitement, camp, comedy and romance, and great location shots from all over Los Angeles. The picture and sound quality are excellent, and the episodes are complete and unedited. One minor annoying thing is that both Amazon and Shout Factory state the discs are full screen, when in fact they are pillar boxed (at least on my system - the wide black bands on either side of the picture). I can alleviate this by changing my TV settings to make the image full screen, but it's a little annoying to do this every time I watch H2H. The discs themselves are bare-bones - no special features or subtitles, if you are wanting such things. Personally I'm thrilled that this was even released, and very happy with the overall quality. I'm already on season 4 and am looking forward to the final season, fingers crossed!",1423872000,,1048,4.609625668449198

3304172,4,B0011UO8ZQ,"First things first, I must say the video quality is top notch.  Then, it starts to go down hill.  Annoyance number 1:  opening theme.  No one has mentioned this, but on every episode on my dvds, the opening theme jumps roughly in.  Hard to explain but Sony's releases were correct, you hear the horn sound and then see the Hart jet.  This release roughly opens playing horn and showing closer view of Hart jet at the same time.  It just seems cheap like Sound Factory couldn't spare the extra one second of video.  Annoyance number two is the full screen showing  (it doesn't show black bars as some of the youngsters claim - full screen is not wide screen, therefore the sides of the screen are not light up ).  Where the Sony releases automatically display in wide screen even though filmed in full screen, this Shout Factory release does not.  I found a work around for this by going to my TVs wide setting and choosing stretch.  It fills up the entire wide screen.  It's just annoying to do this every time I watch Hart to Hart because it zooms in too close for other DVDs.  I hope that Shout Factory will add a little more quality to the Season 4 release.  However, even with the faults, I am glad to have season 3 and now 4 released.  All we need is 5 :)",1423612800,2,1260,4.297872340425532

3304255,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"This recent release from Shout! of Hart to Hart season 3 (1981-82) was, IMO, well worth the wait, as it continued the releases of one of the greatest shows I've ever seen; I was beginning to wonder prior to Shout!'s acquisition whether we would ever get any more. Sure, I was happy with having two seasons' worth of it (1979-81) from Sony (Robert Wagner and Stefanie Powers really made this show with their very believable romance and marriage as Jonathan and Jennifer Hart, and Lionel Stander did his part with his 1983 Golden Globe-winning role of Max, the butler/majordomo/overall helper, who, it was said, was more family than an employee), but when you have a long dry spell between releases of your favorite shows, while the shows you strongly dislike pump out release after release, it wears on you. Kudos to Shout! for picking up the mantle, and here's hoping for another top-flight release in Season 4 (1982-83).",1421366400,4,921,4.8354430379746836
3304256,4,B0011UO8ZQ,this was a  good season and i also dug the campy nature of the show and the over the top higher than thou attitude and how it felt so cool and pretenious. RObert Wagner played that role real well.  Stefanie Powers was charming and attractive and held her role down and the same with Max who was the hired hand however he was more like family.  to me this is cool White People on tv. ain't been what i call Chic since the 80's.,1421280000,,426,4.0476190476190474

In fact, after the tragic loss of Natalie Wood and William Holden (their real life partners) during the filming of the Hart to Hart series, so many people hoped they would get together in real life.  They must have had a wonderful/close real life friendship to play the love birds they did on screen.  This was such an excellent show.  And Lionel Stander (Max) contributed such an important part to the series.",1420416000,,583,4.621359223300971

3304304,5,B0011UO8ZQ,Hart to Hart is a classic show that is well worth watching over and over again. Ignore the other negative comments about the aspect ratio of this show. If your Widescreen TV can enlarge or zoom the picture there will be no black bars at all at least that has been the case with this Region 1 DVD. Good classic shows like this are worth checking out for anyone that didn't get to see Hart to Hart when it first aired in the late 70s and early 80s. The price is a bit high which is the only negative I have for this set.,1420070400,,518,3.9903846153846154

Eleven of the episodes do have the correct theme music, but the ending theme sounds warped.  The show and the episodes are still great, but not being able to get the correct theme for the show after waiting almost nine years for Season 3 to come out is really a turn off, and Shout! Factory ought to refund the money to its customers until the problems are fixed!

A word of caution to potential buyers. This release from Shout Factory  does not show you the full picture on your TV screen as does the first 2 seasons  from Sony.
You will see a vertical black line either side of your screen. Even trying to adjust your TV screen from 16.9 to another setting will not work.
Let us hope that Shout Factory will produce Season 4 in the manner that we received Season's one and two .
In my opinion this detracts from the excellent show that we all loved ,hence  3 stars.( ouch...that hurts)",1419292800,3,549,4.415841584158416

3304412,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"As many of the reviewers have already said, why won't Sony release any further seasons of Hart to Hart?

I'll tell you why.  It's because the DVD industry is now run by 20-30 year olds who seem to think that: (1) nobody over the age of 35 exists; (2) anyone who IS over the age of 35 can't work a DVD player; (3) why would anyone be interested in anything made prior to the year 2000?; (4) why would anyone watch a series with no preening blonde 20 something who spends every episode worrying about whether the hero will still fancy her by the time credits roll; (5) why are there no zombies/vampires/CGI in at least one episode of the run?; (6) why should a series with the main stars being over the age of 30 have any appeal to anyone? (7) the only reason anyone would want to buy a dusty old 1980s series on dvd is if someone's about to mount a remake film or tv series so that anyone under the age of 30 where the Harts would most likely be 20-something lottery-millionaire/X Factor winners who ""made it big"", and viewers will seek out the 80s version purely out of curiosity [and YouTube has probably gone into meltdown].

The evidence?  Just look at what happened to the tv series ""Fame"".  DVD is hungry to release FILMS, so they release the original 1980 version.  oooo! someone asks about the tv series, so season 1 comes out.  Years go by - no sign of any more until ..... a remake of the film filled with the latest crop of teens and 20 somethings.  Yayyy!!  Season 2 of the tv series gets released.  And then what????  NOTHING!!!!!!!!!!!!  We might get season 3 in about 25 years time when ANOTHER remake of ""Fame"" comes out.

Sony is sitting on a vast mountain of excellent tv material, a lot of which is far superior to the image-conscious, shallow rubbish that passes for much of today's television output (some good series excepted, there are a few, but NOT ENOUGH!).

Sony needs to review its employment policy and put some of us 40/50 somethings in charge of the archive-to-dvd department.  Then we'll show today's teens what QUALITY TELEVISION was all about in our youth.

Sony (and MGM) tv execs should hang their heads in shame.",1328659200,88,2148,4.455242966751918

SONY seems not to be impressed by that or by us, the Fans. This company should no longer be able to get any rights for TV-Series on DVD.

i bought two copys of the first season, it was by mistake, but im not complainin, and gobbet up season two as soon as it was awailable.
they do not make shows like this any more, the eighties were magic, and it can not be recreated, sony please release season 3 asap, and hurry up with seasons 4 and 5 allready,
hart to hart is classy show about married couple jennifer and jonathan hart, he is a self made millionaire(this is the 80-ies folks,when a million bucks was a lot of money.
they live in a wonderfully cosy house in bel air(house shown in the exterior shots were owned by june allyson ang dick powell, rj visited the house as a young man and loved it, a little trivia)
with houseman and familymember max and their dog freeway(soo cute)
basically, they live a glamerous life amoung the rich and the wealthy, every episode is an independent story, were they walk into a murder or mystery, witch they solve while still looking wondefull and keeping their cool.
i do not have a favorite episode, they are all great,i can only think of a couple of episodes that bored me, the show kept up a wonderfull standard, even though both rjw and sp had their own personal tragedies during the shows run, you would never have guessed it, only proves how proffessional actors they are,
in my mind, and this probobly sounds silly, jennifer and johnathan are still around somewere, at their house, at a party or at their boat ""romance"" solving crimes and being fabolous.
there are a few shows that actually makes the world a nicer place to be, and hart to hart is on the top of that list

8242663,5,B0011UO8ZQ,"""Hart to Hart"" was such a marvelous, adventurous and unique action, adventure and crime television series.

Jonathan Hart (Robert Wagner) is the CEO of Hart Industries, a Los Angeles-based global conglomerate.
His wife Jennifer (Stefanie Powers) is a freelance journalist.
Living the jetset lifestyle, the Harts often find themselves involved in cases of smuggling, theft,
corporate and international espionage and, most commonly, murder.
At their opulent Bel Air estate, they are assisted by Max (Lionel Stander),
their loyal, gravel-voiced butler, cook and chauffeur who also helps with their cases.
The Harts' beloved pet dog is a Lowchen called Freeway,
so named because he was a stray that they found wandering on the freeway.

Robert Wagner was perfect in the role of the self-made millionaire and amateur detective Jonathan Hart.
Stefanie Powers was perfect in the role of the freelance journalist and amateur detective Jennifer Hart.
Lionel Stander was perfect in the role of the Harts' butler, cook and chauffeur Max.

I'm very confident that all 24 of these episodes are presented in uncut form on this Shout! Factory 6-disc DVD release.

There weren't any teasers included in any of the episodes on this 6-disc set.
It might be possible that each of these 24 episodes didn't have teasers when these episodes originally aired on ABC.

The picture quality is good and the audio quality is tremendous.

The packaging that Shout! Factory used for ""Hart to Hart: The Third Season"" is perfect.
The discs are stored in a plastic DVD case that holds all six discs.
None of the discs share the same side of any of the disc holding trays and none of the discs overlap any of the discs either.
