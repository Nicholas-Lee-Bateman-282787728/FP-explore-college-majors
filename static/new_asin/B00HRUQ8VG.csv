6201159,5,B00HRUQ8VG,"This is a great entry in a very good series. It collects a number of hard to find Gene Autry movies in one place and their restoration quality is very good. I especially like the many bonus features such as the still pictures, posters  and the ""Melody Ranch "" Commentary by Gene  Himself. This is a must have for Gene Autry fans and Western fans in general.  It captures the period of time when Good guys were real heroes and movies provided really ""clean""  entertainment!",1414108800,2,472,4.517647058823529

6201161,5,B00HRUQ8VG,Gene is just the best and this collection corroborates that fact one more time.  And with regard to the people who have been doing this restoration work over the past several years - it's obvious that you are simply the best at what you do.  Not a scene has been skipped or slighted in the least.  Terrific!,1406332800,2,307,4.350877192982456

6201163,5,B00HRUQ8VG,"Gene Autry may well be the original American Idol, his songs are a highlight in all of his movies. And Gene's movies are full of drama, action and even romance, not only with his horse Champion, but with various females leads as well. This collection contains Gene's first color movie, The Strawberry Roan, which costars Champion the Wonder Horse, who later went on to have his own TV series. And Winning Of The West costars Gail Davis, who also went on to have her own TV series as Annie Oakley. Gail Davis was one of Gene's favorite co-stars in the 50's and she appears in many other movies in these collections as well as his TV shows.

What is also interesting is that Clayton Moore, AKA The Lone Ranger, appeared in some of Gene's movies before he became famous, he has a brief role in Barbed Wire and gets into a fist fight with Gene, you can also check for other appearances in collection 2 and 5. So here you get the chance to see what he really looks like without the Lone Ranger mask, albeit though his appearances are fairly brief, and most of the shots are from a distance, no close-ups, and he's usually wearing a hat and has a mustache, but his voice is definitely recognizable. He must have had a premonition that he would get that role because he still manages to keep his face mostly hidden from the camera.

A really enjoyable extra is The Melody Ranch Theater where you get to see Gene and Pat Buttram reminiscing, much like Roy Clark and Archie Campbell in the barbershop skits on Hee Haw, or Johnny Carson and Ed McMahon in the opening sequences on the Tonight Show. And while Gene and Pat are likely in their early 80's, Buttram's sense of humor is right on target. Another enjoyable extra is the Melody Ranch Radio show where you get to here more of Gene's singing and more of Pat's humor.

So this set, in fact, any or all of the other movie or TV collections, would be a good deal to have, once you start with one, you'll want to get them all, they will put you in a good mood everytime",1404432000,3,2011,4.357333333333333

8635034,4,B00HRUQ8VG,"All four are good movies --- just not quite in the five-star category for me.

""Rim of the Canyon"" is the haunted ghost town story and is quite good.  ""Strawberry Roan"" has nice color and longer running time.  I thought the role played by Dick Jones is a bit too cloying at times.  Jack Holt is again trying to kill the horse, just like his role in Roy Rogers' ""Trigger Jr."".  But Gene sings some good songs.

""Barbed Wire"" is pretty good.  Clayton Moore is the outlaw who has a fight with Gene.  Moore was probably on his one-year hiatus from ""The Lone Ranger"" television program.  ""Winning of the West"" is standard fare.  Gail Davis never looked better.

Someone in Production decided that the Melody Ranch Theater segments need to be messed up by including all of the little two or three-second bits of film or sound that occurred in the original broadcasts of these programs during station breaks on the Nashville Network.  It makes for an annoying interference in continuity to the conversations between Autry and Buttram.  This was not an issue in the earlier Gene Autry Collections.",1449273600,,1089,4.698412698412699
8635035,5,B00HRUQ8VG,"One of my favorite western stars.  This set had THE STRAWBERRY ROAN, which I missed when originally released as a single title.  These sets are also a good way to save money.
