4916806,5,B0060MYPU8,"The Fourth Season of Southland was Excellent! Loved Lucy Liu's Character development and her step up to Sgt. John has finally gotten it together and Ben with Nate is an interesting combination. Lydia has a road ahead of her and She is just so very cool and tough on the outside but I think she is thinking hard about her baby and may not last on duty until she delivers... Great stories..Loved
the theme of The Finale and I think Ben DID the right thing!",1332720000,,454,4.352941176470588
4916807,5,B0060MYPU8,I've noticed a HUGE difference in terms of picture & sound quality between the standard video and HD. I would highly recommend that you purchase and view your favorite TV show episodes in High Definition for the best quality!,1331510400,,225,4.794871794871795
4916808,5,B0060MYPU8,"Since I can't watch Southland on TV when it comes on (due to work), I'm glad I'm able to watch them on Amazon.com with no commercial interruptions. The $1.99 per episode is worth it!!",1331510400,2,183,4.411764705882353
4916809,5,B0060MYPU8,This is a great show. Lots of action and real life drama. I don't get this channel as I only have Basic Cable.  It is great to be able to access it through Amazon and so easy to view. The audio is clear and the video is sharp.,1330646400,,226,3.7083333333333335
4916810,5,B0060MYPU8,"It's just the best.  Watched crime drama for a long time: 5-0, Rockford, Hill Street Blues, Law & Order, The Shield, etc.  Saw a few episodes of ""Southland"" (back in season 2) for a taste.  I was hooked.",1329609600,3,203,4.2894736842105265
4916811,5,B0060MYPU8,"The cast makes this show beat with the streets.

At times not too realistic because one does not show gangstas how you do it in real life but then it is as close as it gets!",1329523200,,173,3.8055555555555554
4916812,5,B0060MYPU8,"This is a terrifically good series.
The episodes are filmed on location with such realism and immediacy that the viewer
is completely caught up in the moment and feels as if they are right there in the story.
The scripts are well-thought out and intelligent. Since they don't spell everything out,
you as the viewer have the chance to think about the relationships and figure
out why the people are doing what they do, what the characters are feeling
and why what just happened happened.
This is in keeping with the idea that the viewer is just eavesdropping in at various
(exciting and interesting) times in these people's lives.
The characters are portrayed realistically as people with their own problems who are
trying to do the best they can in really difficult situations.  It makes me really
appreciate the value of good policing in keeping us all safe.  And all the acting is simply
first-rate. Seasons 1 and 2 are also available for streaming and on DVD.  Hopefully,
that will be true for Season 3 soon!",1328486400,6,1012,4.738636363636363

4916839,5,B0060MYPU8,"Addictive show! Watching this series kind of makes one wonder how so many good people in law enforcement can deal with so much crap in such a sucky legal system.

4916890,4,B0060MYPU8,"I loved, loved this series and the characters. It is so sad to have seen it end. It is formulaic but makes the best use of a combo of everyday policing in a terrible urban environment, and the police themselves who spend their souls on facing the crime, petty, horrifying, tedious, every day. The ending is just horrendous. Not sure we needed poor Michael Cudlitz to have to go thru that.",1391212800,,388,4.47887323943662

4916895,5,B0060MYPU8,"Don't want to spoil anything but this shows just gets better and better. I am no critic, just an average viewer, but I really like the characters, interactions between them and their flaws. Watch from Season 1, you will get hooked on it.",1381104000,,237,4.534883720930233

4916899,5,B0060MYPU8,Great show.. This was the fourth season of Southland watched and it just keeps getting better and better.  Can't wait for the entire 5th season to be available. I will purchase that season as well..,1369699200,,198,4.6571428571428575
4916900,5,B0060MYPU8,This show is excellent  in it representation of what the duties of a police officer is like in the real world of the inner cities.  Excellent.,1369699200,,142,4.423076923076923
4916901,5,B0060MYPU8,"Yeah, another cop show. I know. But, there's something different about this one and I think it is the editing. When everyone is ""out in the field"" and it's switching between locations the editing makes it sharp, crisp, and dynamic. Very effective and it holds your attention. And, this 4th Season with Lucy Lui was a kick. She plays a complex character and does a good job of it.

I don't have cable TV and TNT shows aren't shown on Hulu so I pick what I want to watch from Amazon. This was worth the money.",1368662400,,507,4.28125

4916903,5,B0060MYPU8,There are so many stories of interest operating in parallel that the time watching the series seems very short duration.  I have bought all four of the season shows and intend to purchasing the fifth season.  Great TV.,1367366400,,218,4.7105263157894735
4916922,5,B0060MYPU8,"What more can I say than BRAVO!!!  I wish there were more shows that could find the perfect blend of characters, then add just enough of their personal lives into just the right amount of action and drama.  Sadly, most cop shows turn into mere soap operas in uniform.",1366329600,,267,4.428571428571429
4916923,5,B0060MYPU8,"This show is so gritty and fabulous.  Season 4 continues that tradition.  The characters seem like real people and although some of the stories seem a little far-fetched, I'll bet they reflect real life pretty well.",1364947200,,215,4.944444444444445

Perusing amazon.com tv series one day and had seen a commercial in the past for this show but forgotten it until I saw it here. Bought an episode and BINGO! This show is not only a must see with great acting. It's worth my small amount of free time to watch. Not to mention that it's easy on the eyes.

4916930,4,B0060MYPU8,This show is in my top ten favorite of all time. I purchased the instant amazon version because its available faster to me and the only complaint I have is that in the instant version they don't have the theme song over the opening credits. The theme song sets a tone for the show and it jarring that it's a different generic song.,1360368000,,331,4.26984126984127

They are amazing characters, acted by great actress and actors. The script is so real and you just know that is how they talk. The way they start the show off is a little different and I love that. I can't wait for the next one. This time I will be watching my tv and will even buy the DVD. So real and the camera action is great. You feel like you are in the car going down the road. I really look somewhat different at our men and women out there doing the dirty work like any soldier. It is a war on the streets.

But less than other Fuzzy headed//all model portrayed TV shows. I like that they are using older solid actors and mixing them in with ""todays"" actors. C Thomas Howell and Bokeem Woodbine for example. There are several others as well. They are also not afraid to ""kill"" people off in the series. Which is only refreshing because it brings in new characters and new dynamics all the time.

4916972,5,B0060MYPU8,"""Street Fighting Man"" by the Stones fades over the final poolside scene of the season finale of ""Southland"" Season 4, and it dawns on you, ""This isn't simply a good show--this is one of the best shows on television.""

Perhaps the fact that I was born and raised 10 minutes from downtown L.A. has something to do with my keen affection for this show. But I don't think Southland is one of those shows with so many ""inside"" references and jokes to make it irrelevant or out of touch with the rest of the nation.

It's just flat out damn good TV. Glad to hear TNT is bringing it back for a fifth season. There is justice on the streets of Los Angeles, after all.",1348099200,,659,4.264
4916973,5,B0060MYPU8,"After I saw the first season of Southland, I was hooked. I'm not really into cop shows, but after seeing Benjamin Mckenzie was in this, I knew I wanted to check it out. Show is brilliant. Following cops around in LA, where there is already so much controversy over how cops handle things. Bringing Lucy Liu on the fourth season was undeniably one of the best choices that producers could have done to change up the cast a bit.

Every episode is interesting, and deals with situations that are very real and that most wouldn't want to deal with. Regina King does an excellent job as the Sargent. I think that the cast of this show was chosen wisely. I'm looking forward to the next season. I hope Lucy Liu will be coming back!

This show is gritty, real, emotional, quirky, and at the end of every episode you feel like you helped fight crime (in a way, but not really).",1338768000,,869,4.391304347826087

Beautifully written, expertly acted, as gritty and dark and hardcore as it is laugh out loud funny and emotionally compelling. I understand they've renewed it for two more seasons; I look forward to watching its evolution. Bravo!!!",1337126400,,379,4.8307692307692305
4916975,5,B0060MYPU8,"Southland is by far the best cop show currently on television right now.  It's almost criminal how Warner Brothers has treated this show for the home video market.  Season 1 got a wide DVD release, Season 2 was MOD and Season 3 is nowhere to be found.  Season 4 is uncertain as well.

With TNT renewing this for a 5th season, I think it's time for them to get their act together and realize there is a demand for this show and it does have a solid fanbase that will support it.

Season 4 was a interesting season for the show.  Some of the characters took a darker turn and another had a major life changing event happen.  It also featured a solid recurring guest star, Lucy Liu, who brought alot of fire and intensity to the show as Officer John Cooper (Michael Cudlitz) new partner.  She also comes with alot of baggage and a dark past.

Warner Brothers, Get this show on DVD ASAP!!",1336176000,,884,4.3090909090909095
