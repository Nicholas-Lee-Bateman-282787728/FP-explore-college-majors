2332304,5,B0009X770E,"I have enjoyed the well-priced Universal Legacy Collections featuring their classic monster films of the 30s and 40s and have been waiting and hoping for them to release the balance of their classic horror titles. This DVD collection is the one I have been wishing for. Now I will finally have two of my favorite horror films of the 1930s, ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Raven,"" on DVD.

As much as I am delighted by this set I find it an interesting and somewhat sad chronicle of Lugosi's early film career. The disc features an early 30s film following his success in ""Dracula"" where he is the main star (""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" 1932), two films which team him in a role of equal stature with his rival, Boris Karloff (""The Black Cat"" and ""The Raven,"" 1934 and 35 respectively), a film which exploited the marquee value of his name but gave him a more minor role (""The Invisible Ray"" 1937), and, finally, a film which saw him slip into a rather demeaning supporting role (""Black Friday"" 1940) beside his old equal, Karloff.

Within eight years Lugosi had gone from full-fledged leading man to supporting actor. It must have compounded matters for Lugosi to have Karloff continue to receive leading roles while he was reduced to small supporting roles in Karloff's films. The duo would work again in 1945 in RKO's ""The Body Snatchers"" where Lugosi, again, played a minor role opposite Karloff's much meatier portrayal. Lugosi's career was on a steady downward slide by this point (with few exceptions like ""Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein"") and would continue to decline through the next decade until his death in the mid-1950s.

The best part of this collection are the earliest films (pre-1937) which represent Universal's golden age of horror. This era saw the original ""Dracula"" (1931), ""Frankenstein"" (1931), ""The Invisible Man"" (1933), and Universal's masterpiece ""Bride of Frankenstein"" (1935). In the early 30s Universal was a studio committed to making quality horror films. In fact, these horror films saved Universal from certain bankruptcy in the dark days of the Great Depression (Abbott and Costello and Deanna Durbin would do the same for the studio ten years later). With the support of Carl Leammle, Jr. they produced A films with good scripts, good directors (Tod Browning, James Whale, etc.), moody sets and photography, amazing makeup by Jack Pierce, and wonderful casts.

As mentioned earlier, ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Raven"" are the two films I will enjoy most on this set and they alone are well worth the $20 dollar price tag. Both films take their titles from the works of Edgar Allen Poe but, unlike ""Murders in the Rue Morgue,"" that is where the connection ends. ""The Black Cat"" is a pre-code tale of revenge and Satanism set in a spectacular art deco mansion built on the site of a bloody World War I battlefield. Lugosi and Karloff are bitter enemies who meet for one final battle of wits. ""The Raven"" sees Lugosi as a demented, Poe loving, plastic surgeon who disfigures Karloff and blackmails him into aiding him in a plot to punish a woman who has scorned him. Both films are perfect vehicles for their two stars and represent the well-mounted, quality horror product Universal became famous for.",1122249600,187,3233,4.862068965517241

2332318,4,B0009X770E,"The Bela Lugosi Collection

Bela Lugosi gained fame in 1931 when he played the vampire from Transylvania in the movie Dracula. He had played in many movies, usually as a villain. He was limited by his accent, except when it was useful as in Ninotchka. Few people who come to America as adults lose their accent. He had an interesting personal life as well, being married five times. He fled his native Hungary after the collapse of a revolution (he had formed the first actors union in the world). Lugosi means from Lugos, his place of birth. These five are only a fraction of his many movies, most of which are better. The individual reviews have more details.

Murders in the Rue Morgue (1932) show how Dr. Mirakle plans his experiments to inject blood from a gorilla into a human woman. Does this test require virginity of the subject? When the attempts fail the waste products are dumped into the river. Was this meant as an attack on Darwinian Theory? Wasnt Darwins Theory used as a rational for the murder of millions? [Is this story just a rationale for the actual experiment?]

The Black Cat (1934) begins at a train station with the Allisons, a young couple. A psychiatrist has a phobia about cats. The couple seek shelter after a bus accident. What if the owner of the house is a powerful madman who seeks to use them in an obscene ceremony? Can they escape with their lives before anything else goes wrong?

The Raven (1935) begins with a car accident. Can Jean be saved? Yes, a complete recovery. Does Dr. Vollin wand a much younger woman? Does he have a secret passion that will be exposed? Will a sadist fall into his own trap?

The Invisible Ray (1936) tells about an expedition to find a rare mineral. What if this rare metal is also poisonous to the touch? Will it affect a scientist and turn him into a killer? Will it cause this scientist to glow in the dark? Will a woman fall in love with a man who is not worthy and too old?

Black Friday (1940) begins when Professor Kingsley is injured when two gangs shoot at each others. Can Dr. Sovac save his life by an illegal operation? Will a recovered Professor Kingsley have new memories and a new personality? Will Dr. Sovac get the blame for a murder he didn't commit?",1477872000,,2236,4.495073891625616

2332369,5,B0009X770E,"No klinkers here. The weakest is MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE. Years ago I wrote off RUE MORGUE as pure B.S> but now it shines from the art supervision and the directing of Florey. The intercuts of the close-up chimp face (same one from UNHOLY 3) to Charles Gemora in a Gorilla suit really don't work, never did and just can't. Otherwise, it's fun.  Some mispronunciations crept in damaging the realism of the dialog. Nice to see Arlene Francis as the crucified streetwalker!
Bela really dominates and shines in THE BLACK CAT. It looks very pre-code. THE INVISIBLE RAY was always a favorite, since seeing it on magic Saturday night after spending the evening at the Geneva Drive-In watching THE INCREDIBLE SHRINKING MAN with my Boy Scout troop leader's son, old friend Billy Christianson. What A night. May I point out that this film is pure pulp at its best: a weird menace, science that still holds up, about seeing ancient earth from Andromeda, and besides, this movie set the style for a ""death by numbers"" revenge plot richly echoed in both DR. PHIBES films. Down to the melting of a token representing each victim. Boris looks good as a younger Greek, black curly hair and mustache, but it's too bad he wears a stuffed padded suit all thru the darn thing. He looks better emaciated, as in BLACK CAT.
THE RAVEN looks good, but it's kind of silly. I do love Karloff as Bateman, the man who burnt the face off the bank teller with his blowtorch... and the painted-on gauze ""dead eye"" still works, for me at least... clever Mr. Jack Pierce (makeup).
The Franz Waxman score, though minimal in RAY holds up nicely. His real tour-de-force remains BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN.
What else? Dr. Mirakle, Dr. Vollin, Man on a mission to avenge his compatriots, Vitos Werdegast...

Included is kind of a dog for Bela fans, as he essays the role of a big city Hungarian gangster in BLACK FRIDAY. Hardly a proper vehicle for Bela. It's stanley Ridges' movie all the way, with a whole lot of Karloff as the obsessed doctor. I probably won't watch it any time soon. I'd have preferred they included BOWERY AT MIDNIGHT but I doubt Universal owns it... There's a cheat in BOWERY that someone with an old mannish American voice dubbed for Bela when he was in disguise as the supposed blind man running the soup kitchen for derelicts in the Bowery. Check it out.

HUMAN MONSTER/THE DARK EYES OF LONDON is worth a look too, but kind of depressing for  you unless you really like Edgar Wallace potboilers. Bela is a real rat in this one, with no charm other than being Lugosi!.",1405900800,2,2551,4.612334801762114

2332388,4,B0009X770E,"The Bela Lugosi (and Boris Karloff) collection. 5 movies starring Universal's Titans of Terror from the 1930s and early 1940s.

""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" - The only solo Lugosi offering was better than I expected--although like a lot of early talkies, it can be a bit static at times & it's curious to me that Robert Florey & crew decided to cut in closeup shots of a real ape instead of just showing us a man in an apesuit for the entire film. I guess they were striving for realism in a most unreal story. 4 stars

""The Black Cat"" - The first Lugosi/Karloff pairing by Universal, starts off a bit slow then picks up steam halfway through in a bizarre tale with Karloff as a practicing Satanist who has married & then murders both Lugosi's wife and daughter in this morbid tale. Of course, Lugosi gets his revenge at the end when he tortures Karloff & gets an undeserved bullet from David Manners for his troubles. 4 1/2 stars

The Raven - One wonders why Lugosi did not receive top billing for this picture because he dominates the whole film. In fact, I think it's 17 minutes into the movie before we see Karloff--but maybe in the wake of ""Frankenstein"" and ""Bride of Frankenstein"", Universal may have thought Karloff's name had a little more cache at the box office. In any event, it's a really good movie. 4 1/2 stars

The last 2 films in the collection, ""The Invisible Ray"" and ""Black Friday"" are more Karloff-centric and are average at best. One wonders what could have been in the case of ""Black Friday"" if Lugosi had played the doctor & Karloff the dual gangster role--which I believe was originally intended for the movie before things got switched around for who knows what reasons.

Lugosi was utterly wasted playing a 2 bit hood & barely seems to have any screen time--but that didn't stop Universal from plastering his name all over the film's with Karloff.

Btw, I would like to add that I had no technical issues with this collection as far as freezing or any other malfunctions. All the movies played great on my DVD player.

Overall, I would say the Bela Lugosi collection is solid--even though the last 2 films fell short of my high expectations. 4 stars for Bela and Boris.",1376092800,5,2195,4.541772151898734

That being the case, I've become quite familiar with Bela Lugosi and he is one of my favorite actors of that era.  I was quite excited to run across this set, but while there are a handful of gems, there are some downfalls here that dampen its potential.

This collection contains five Universal Studios Lugosi films that span from 1932 to 1940.  This is a single, two-sided disc that has a total feature running time of 5 hours and 37 minutes.  The first side is what I call the ""Poe Side,"" as it has Murders in the Rue Morgue, The Black Cat and The Raven.  These are undoubtedly the best offerings here and showcase why Lugosi is a legend.  The second side is where I lost a good deal of interest.  The Invisible Ray and Black Friday are good films for what they are, but neither of them (especially Black Friday,)feature Lugosi for more than a few minutes and are carried by Boris Karloff.  I'm just as big a fan of Karloff and he does a good job with the roles, but I am disappointed from the perspective that this is a Lugosi collection.  Ideally, Black Friday would have been replaced with Dracula or Son of Frankenstein.

I'm basing my four star rating on the fact that The Black Cat and The Raven are two of my favorite movies and the acting supremely illuminates both Lugosi and Karloff.  In addition, even if the final two movies aren't necessarily Lugosi films so to speak, they're still enjoyable to watch.",1371859200,12,1570,4.451048951048951

What I find odd is that with the exception of Murders in the Rue Morgue, this would be much more accurately titled as The Bela Lugosi/Boris Karloff Collection, especially since Lugosi plays second banana to Karloff in three of the four movies in which they appear together.  That said, the movies look great and are prime examples of just how twisted and disturbing 1930s horror could be.  The scene in which Lugosi takes his revenge against Karloff in The Black Cat remains as horrific today as anything in the most outlandish torture porn flick.

2332408,4,B0009X770E,"I've NEVER been a fan of the ""double-sided DVD"" format...it's a recipe for disaster. I did actually get a defective copy of this first time around and exchanged it. So that's the ""glass half full"" aspect of Universal choosing to do this in the first place...KEEP YOUR RECEIPT when you buy this because there's a 50-50 chance you'll be using it to make an exchange.

That said, there are two ""very good"" films in this set...""Murders In The Rue Morgue"" and ""The Black Cat""...one which is simply boring, plodding, and not fun at all (""Black Friday"")...and two that are ESSENTIAL simply because of their downright WEIRDNESS, ""The Raven"" and ""The Invisible Ray.""

Lugosi and Karloff are known, of course, for the ""monster"" films to a large degree. But they each made a number of films that were all over the stylistic map. Karloff signed better contracts, but Lugosi's super-super-super-low-budget films like ""Ape Man"" and ""Devil Bat"" were so mind-numbingly bad that they rivaled the BEST of any of Ed Wood's films (meaning: FUN).

""Murders"" and ""Cat"" are more in the mold of the ""classic Universal horror films."" But ""The Raven"" features a completely insane Lugosi played against the low-rent hood Karloff. At one point Lugosi famously says to Karloff ""SO, you held the burning torch in his FACE..."" Karloff pauses for a moment and says ""Well, some times you can't help things like that."" Lugosi plays a character who, to put it simply, is really into torture, to the point where he replicates torture devices from Poe classics and then finds unwilling victims. It's a perfect role for Lugosi, he really rips into it, and Karloff counters that by playing his role with sustained tongue-in-cheek black humor. I don't want to talk about the film in detail because I'll be giving up spoilers. If this were a stand-alone movie I'd give it 5 stars and would be badgering you mercilessly to buy it NOW.

Same goes for ""Invisible Ray,"" but this time Karloff steers the plot. He glows in the days before ""special effects"" were as effortless as a couple of mouse clicks. He wears a welders' helmet and melts rocks and has a work crew of African villagers who decide they've had enough and as they are preparing to leave says ""watch this"" and melts a huge boulder and the workers say ""OK, we'll stay."" The scenes shot inside Karloff's castle ""at the top of the Carpathian mountains"" have all of the WONDERFUL gothic vibes found in the BEST Universal flims of the day.

So if you OVERLOOK the chance that you have a 50/50 chance of getting defective discs and view this as a DOUBLE FEATURE of two MUST-HAVE films, two pretty good ones, and one you don't have to watch if you don't want to, the price is right. EVERY Halloween I do a ""Universal Marathon"" and watch ALL of the Frankenstein, Wolfman, Dracula, Mummy & Creature From The Black Lagoon films throughout the month of October. I include ""Invisible Ray"" and ""The Raven."" If you like the monster films, there is no way you can be without these. BUY IT!",1360022400,,2993,4.7041984732824424

Bela Lugosi is my favorite actor of all time and i plan to see most of the movies he's made. These films are not considered ""The Classics"" that every body knows. this is a great DVD but it has one fault. I'll review the movies. The Black Cat is a great movie with a wonderful plot. although Lugosi was in it, it was not my favorite performance by him. this movie was really all about Karloff's performance for me. The Raven was the reverse. Bela Lugosi shined bright in this film playing the menacing madman obsessed with the writings of Poe. Karloff's performance wasn't as great. Murder's In The Rue Morgue is by far the best movie on this collection. really great performance by Lugosi and it resembled Dr. Caligari with the houses bending at different angles and the climax scene with Erik the Ape being shot. The Invisible Ray was okay. another movie were Karloff shines over Lugosi and the overall story is great. a doctor who has a poison in him tries to kill his former friends because he believes they took the credit for something he created. Black Friday was the worst movie on this DVD. it should not have been there. it's an extremely confusing movie and it lacks in plot. Lugosi is barely shown and has a minor role in it. overall it is a great set but Black Friday should have been replaced with another Lugosi film",1357344000,3,1466,4.4535315985130115

Murders in the Rue Morgue isn't very faithful to Edgar Allan Poe's tale but it is eerie and gothic, sexual on a mild level, which gained silly attention unwarranted by the movie; no nudity but rape and torture are implied. The first time I saw this was on this collection.

The Black Cat, The Raven (1935), The Invisible Ray and Black Friday all aired on Thriller Theater the year I graduated high school.

Black Cat, another Poe-centric tale (little of Poe/long on creepy), is a very atmospheric treasure; beautifully shot in greyscale.

The Raven, the first version to Por's haunting love poem, is a very adult themed film for the 1930's, like Murders in the Rue Morgue, it has serious sexual connotations, but remains a brilliantly lensed affair. Not much on keeping with Poe, either, though.

The Invisible Ray is the only science fiction death ray/radiation movie here and creeped me out when I was a teen (don't know why in retrospect).

Black Friday is Friday the 13th in hiding; bad luck can be fun! Watch it and see!

This boxset is from Universal's Legacy Collection and is often suggested by me for friends of Horror to dive headfirst into.

But the DVD is sandwiched between plastic, so DVD well protected. Extras? Scene selection and a few trailers, ... that's it. Overall presentation done very much like the Universal Archives Collection (includes ""Night Monster""}...done very similarly in every regard. The great news is that this Lugosi collection features excellent picture and sound. And not only are these important Bela performances, but Karloff is stellar here, too. My favorite of the collection is ""The Raven"". Bela is SO GREAT!! Absolutely sinister and superbly evil....yet enjoyably so! About 8 great ""one-liners...and in my opinion one of Bela's top three performances. Interesting side-bar: Opening credits of ""The Raven"" tout ""Karloff"". ..and ""Lugosi"" (single name).

I've watched the pricing on this nifty set for about two years (Amazon and elsewhere). I suppose anything's possible...but it has hovered in the $19-$22 range period! My suggestion...buy it now...it's more likely to become extinct than substantially cheaper. It has not budged much price-wise! And these are really cool ""Shock Theater"" featured films! Bela and Boris rock! They always deliver first class work. ""The Raven"" alone is worth the price.""Black Friday"" is much more a Karloff vehicle than Lugosi.

2332427,5,B0009X770E,"If you enjoy horror movies from the 30's, you'll love this. The disc quality is poor, as many of the other reviews point out.

First, don't expect Dracula, or even Frankenstein. Only the Black Cat hints at the supernatural and not much of that. The closest thing to a monster is the gorilla in Murders In The Rue Morgue. Three of the five border between horror and sci-fi (Rue Morgue, The Invisible Ray, and Black Friday).

As others have pointed out, four of the five movies co-star Boris Karloff. And, to be honest, this shows Karloff to be a stronger actor than Lugosi. In fact, as someone else pointed, Karloff starred in Black Friday, and Lugosi had a supporting role, with no screen time shared with Karloff. However, I enjoyed Lugosi as an actor. He reminded me of Ron Lea, who played Dr. Crain on Doc. By the way, this set shows Karloff and Lugosi with various degrees of bad hair (Karloff in the Black Cat made me think of the Grinch -- the animated version as opposed to Jim Carrey's).

I enjoyed seeing ""The Raven"" -- not to be confused with the '60's version which had Vincent Price, Peter Lorre, and an older Boris Karloff, which was slightly closer to the original poem by Poe than this version (which isn't saying much). My father had bought me a book on the films of Boris Karloff when I was a teen-ager, and I always wanted to see it. I wasn't disappointed.

That being said, the strongest two were ""The Invisible Ray"" and ""Black Friday"", in my opinion. The weakest was ""The Black Cat."" But others enjoyed it, so it depends on your taste.",1335657600,,1555,4.4840989399293285
2332428,4,B0009X770E,"This set of 5 films could actually be the BELA LUGOSI/BORIS KARLOFF collection since Karloff stars in 4 of the films. I had no idea that they had made several films together.
A friend recommended I see THE BLACK CAT and I decided to get this collection of several films.
There will never be a horror team like Lugosi and Karloff. They reigned supreme in the horror film genre in their heyday. Here are 5 very different films. Lugosi is not always the bad guy though you never quite know about his character. Except for Arlene Francis in a small role in MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, none of the other actors were familiar to me. I wondered who these actors were and what happened to their careers.
THE BLACK CAT was the most interesting of the 5 films because it was so stylized. The main setting of the story is in a house that has an Art Deco feel and would have been the height of modern style in the day. Everything seems angular and linear. When we first see Boris Karloff in shadows, he is all angles and almost cartoonish.
The odd thing about THE BELLA LUGOSI COLLECTION - THE FRANCHISE COLLECTION is that the 5 films are on one disk. Three films are on one side and two on another. It looks like UNIVERSAL wanted to save some money on this release. Although the films were good quality, there seems to have been no major restoration nor are there any extras of note. Any background information on the films and their actors would have been a big plus.
The films are short. Most are not much longer than an hour or so. It is easy to get through the collection quickly and to get an idea of Lugosi and Karloff.
There were a few constants in every film. There is always a young couple madly in love. The woman, although somewhat independent in thinking, relies heavily on the man as her protector. They always cross paths with Lugosi who intentions are always suspicious. The woman has to be very slender since she is constantly fainting from fear and surprise and has to be carried to her bed for rest. There's her scream and then she faints. It was funny how that was always consistent through all the films.
I enjoyed this look at Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff. This collection is a good start for anyone who is not very familiar with their work.",1335139200,,2251,4.400479616306955
2332429,5,B0009X770E,"I would give this package 5 stars based on one performance alone. Bela Lugosi's maddening portrayal of Dr. Vollin, in THE RAVEN. However, THE BLACK CAT may be the best overall film of the five. MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE is definitely a classic, and scenery is definitely the most atmospheric of the five, but it lacks in direction. THE INVISIBLE RAY is an early attempt at science fiction, but fails with mis casting. Lugosi would have been much better as the deranged scientist, which Karloff was given. BLACK FRIDAY should have stayed on the shelf.

So let's begin with the earliest of he 5, MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE. Filmed in 1932, the golden age of horror. Lugosi's portrayal of a mad doctor/side show ring master is one of the finest of his vast and mythic career. He looks menacing and evil. Lugosi's hair is always slick and perfect, but not here. His black hair stands tall and proud, face is chiseled and chin is strong. His black cloak compliments his crazed look. Our story opens at a side show carnival, beautifully done. Our heroes of the story gather round, watching the oddities, alas stumbling upon ERIC, THE APEMAN. They pay the fee to see the show and stumble upon Lugosi and his ape, which he bills as, ""the first man!"" The crowd scoffed and Lugosi is enraged, telling the crowd, ""he shall prove their kinship with the ape!"" This scene has so much atmosphere, the rest of the film can hardly keep up. There is too much focus on the love story and pathetic comedy relief than the brutal horror of this Edgar Allan Poe short. Still is atmospheric and most definitely strange for today, yet alone for 1932. A classic.

Next is THE BLACK CAT. I smile as I wrote the title, just thinking of the great movie itself. Evil Karloff lives in the country of Hungary, not in a castle, but a very modern looking mansion, which must have added to the strange feel. This modern look would have been much ahead of its time. Karloff awaits the return of his old friend, I say with tongue in cheek, for Bela Lugosi, who has rotted as a prisoner of war for ""fifteen years,"" he tells David Manners and his love aboard a train for Hungary. Lugosi's delivery aboard the train is one of the finest of the film and sets a tone that Lugosi is seeking revenge. David and his love, are now afraid. They arrive and travel by bus for their separate destinations, however, the hard rain is horrid and the driver, perhaps to enthralled in the telling of his spooky stories wrecks, and the driver is killed. Lugosi marches his strange looking servant and David and his love to... Karloff's home. And I will leave the rest to you... Torture, satanic sacrifice, and if your wife dies, well, just marry her daughter. Yes, the sadistic plot would fare well today. Absolute classic!

Let us continue to THE RAVEN, which led to the band of horror films all together in England. Another film loosely, loosely based on an Edgar Allan short. The film opens with Lugosi sitting in his study, a mounted raven resting on his desk, as he quotes the poem, THE RAVEN, to a owner of a museum. Lugosi goes on to tell the man that, ""death is my talisman."" The man is enthralled in Lugosi's knowledge or obsession of Edgar Allan Poe. The museum keeper asks, of Lugosi's curious talisman. He tells him, ""death is the one indistructable force in the universe."" This scene sets the tone for an unbelievable film of torture and torment, all caused by a forbidden love. Lugosi's height of unmatched talent in the year 1935. A must see classic.

THE INVISIBLE RAY is not even in the same room as the other three and BLACK FRIDAY is not even in the same time zone. But watch the others and enjoy. If you are a fan of the era, you will be delighted.",1332633600,,3711,4.493333333333333

This collect is an ensemble of five movies of Bela Lugosi film career. Maybe not all five are his best work, but are still a joy to watch. My criticism of this collection are first the last two movies The Invisible Ray and Black Friday are mainly Boris Karloff films and don't belong in this collection. Boris Karloff plays lead actor in The Invisible Ray and Lugosi in a supporting role and in Black Friday Boris Karloff shared lead actor and Lugosi is in more or less a minor role and his whole screen time in Black Friday is around twenty minutes. My second fought with this collection that there is no commentary about Bla Lugosi or any of the movies in this collection. The Bela Lugosi Collection at best gets an A- from me.

Murders in the Rue Morgue is one hour and one minute long and was released on February 21, 1932. If there is a plot to this movie I could not find one. Murders in the Rue Morgue is set in 1845 Paris, France and it is based very loosely on the by Edgar Allen Poe by the same name. The movie stars Bela Lugosi as Dr. Mirakle. Dr. Mirakle is abducting women off the streets and inserting his pet gorilla blood into them so Erik (his gorilla) can have a mate. Only females with pure clean blood will the serum work on. Finally he finds one, but Erik kills Dr. Mirakle and kidnaps Camille L'Espanaye. His death ends when Pierre Dupin shoots him. The sound in this movie is horrible in the beginning. I can barely understand what is said in the first twenty minutes. This gets a D on my list. The script should have been better.

The Black Cat is one hour and six minutes long and was released on May 7, 1934. This would be the first time that Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff team up. They would team up together another five times. Bela Lugosi the star and reluctant hero of the movie (though he did not get top billing) is Dr. Vitus Werdegast who is on his way to visit an old friend, Hjalmar Poelzig. Dr. Vitus Werdegast is returning reclaim his wife and daughter, whom he claims Hjalmar Poelzig stole 18 years ago. The story is full of suspense and eerie music to go with it a well. Even for a brief five minutes The Black Cat has a sense of humor. There is one minor flaw to this movie. When we see Boris Karloff playing the organ, there is music to be heard. The only exception is that he has not touched a key yet. Also the music that he is playing or not playing is the theme from the Phantom of the Opera. The movie ends with Bela Lugosi blowing up Fort Marmorisch and taking Boris with him. The movie gets an A++ for the scares.

The movie starts off with Jean Thatcher (Irene Ware) driving fast on a road and slamming on the brakes. Her car tumbles of the road and rushed to the hospital. There only retired Dr. Richard Vollin can save her. Dr. Jerry Halden and Judge Thatcher implore Dr. Richard Vollin. Dr. Vollin finally agrees to operate. A month later and Jean Thatcher has made a full recovery. Dr. Vollin has fallen in love with Jean and Judge Thatcher disapproves of it. Around this time Edmund Bateman enters the picture. He wants the services of Dr. Vollin so he can have a new face. Edmund is on the run from the police. He is an escaped prisoner who has killed two guards. Dr. Vollin changes his face into a hideous face on the right side and blind in the right eye. Dr. Vollin agrees to change his face if only if he does him a favor. Reluctantly Bateman agrees to do his bidding. Dr. Vollin has thrown a party at his home and has invited some people over; including Dr. Jerry Halden and Jean Thatcher; as well as Judge Thatcher. Unknown to everyone, Dr. Vollin is planning to kill those three. Bateman, who has fallen for Jean Thatcher, does not want her killed. In the end Bateman kills Vollin and everybody is saved. In the movie Judge Thatcher is sometimes called Dr. Thatcher and when Boris Karloff wakes up after the operation and see his new face, one can hear his famous Frankenstein monster growl.

He uses part of criminal brain of Red Cannon also played by Stanly Ridges. Dr. Ernest Sovac does this in a small part to save his friend's life but, mainly to find the half million dollars that Red Cannon has hidden away so Dr. Ernest Sovac can continue his experiments. After the operation is over, Professor George Kingsley has headaches and begins to show signs of Red Cannon.

Red sees Jean Sovac, Dr. Sovac's daughter, and chokes her into telling where the money is. Dr. Sovac sees this and shoots and kills Red Cannon. As the body lies dying, the audience sees the one and only transformation into Professor George Kingsley.

2332451,4,B0009X770E,"Four of these five films teams Bela with Boris Karloff, which makes it an even better bargain. The best films out of the bunch are ""The Raven,"" ""Black Friday,"" and ""The Invisible Ray."" I'm not a big fan of ""The Black Cat"" or ""Murders in the ue Morgue.""

Lugosi is at his maniacal best in ""The Raven."" Here, he plays a mad doctor obsessed with the tales of Edgar Allen Poe who wants to get even with the people standing in the way of his desire to marry a former patient. To that end, he blackmails escaped convict Karloff into helping him by deliberately marring his facial features to make him ""monstrously ugly."" Unless Karloff helps Lugosi torture and murder Lugosi's enemies in a basement torture chamber, he won't restore his face.

In ""Black Friday,"" Lugosi has a mostly minor but memorable role as a gangster. Karloff tranplants a portion of a gangster's brain into the skull of a kindly college professor played by Stanley Ridges. It soon becomes clear that Ridges' personality sometimes reverts to the deceased gangster, and Karloff tries to take advantage of this by prodding Ridges into telling him where thousands of dollars of blood money is hidden. However, Lugosi and other gangsters are after the money, as well.

Lugosi plays a heroic part in ""The Invisible Ray"" to Karloff's villain, who becomes endowed with a ray that makes him literally deadly to touch. Karloff takes advantage of this new power and begins to wipe out his perceived enemies, and it's up to Lugosi to find a way to stop him.

All of the films in the collection look and sound good in this DVD set. Well worth it for any fan of Bela Lugosi.",1318636800,2,1626,4.615916955017301
2332452,5,B0009X770E,"The reason why I titled this review ""Double Dose of Lugosi and Karloff"" is because I will only be focusing on two films in this collection. The two films I will be focusing on are&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Cat-VHS/dp/6302526191/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Cat [VHS</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Raven-VHS/dp/6302526140/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Raven [VHS</a>]. They could have just made a double feature of these two films and it would have sold just fine. Instead they made a five film collection featuring three other films that varry in quality. I am not saying Rue Morgue and Invisible Ray are bad films, though I do admit I find them a little silly. I am simply saying that I find The Black Cat and The Raven to be the superior films in this collection. By 1934, neither Bela Lugosi or Boris Karloff needed the great make-up of Jack Pierce to be scary anymore. People knew who they were and they were amazing actors and truely terrifying.

The Black Cat is a psychological, sadistic, expressionistic and satanic horror film. Lugosi comes back from the war seeking his daughter and accusing Karloff of murdering his wife. As it turns out Karloff married Lugosi's wife, and when she died, he married his daughter. So, that means technically he married his step daughter. Karloff is willing to board a stranded couple for a couple of days only so that the woman can be a part of his satanic ritual. In the end Lugosi skins Karloff alive for what he has done. This film is very extreme for the time and even today, watching that last scene where you see Karloff's tied up hands react to being cut by Lugosi is disturbing.

The Raven is about Lugosi being a retired doctor who has taken on an obsession with Edgar Allan Poe. He has done this to the point where he has built his own (working!) replicas of some of the torture devices of Poe's literature, including the pendalum from Pit and the Pendalum. Like Karloff in The Black Cat, Lugosi has taken in a stranded couple. He has fallen on love with the woman however. He can not have her so he goes mad and attempts to use Karloff, whom Lugosi has surgically disfigured to make him do his bidding, to murder people. In the end Lugosi becomes victim to his own torture devices.

Even though these two films do not feature vampires, werewolves, or man made creatures, they are so good that they are considered by me to be Universal Classic Monster films along the ranks of Dracula and Frankenstein.",1316563200,,2572,5.047058823529412

Murder in the Rue Morgue is excellent and is the only one that Bela is the sole star. Great film.
The Black Cat is one of the most discussed films of this era and it still leaves you with an uneasy feeling. Great movie for this film alone I recommend the collection.
Invisible Ray is karloff as the deranged killer and Lugosi in one of his few hero roles. The special effects are so well done for the time.
Black Friday is the real b movie of this group and still worth watching unfortunately it does show Bela is starting his down ward slope as he is little more than a bit player.

2332455,4,B0009X770E,"I was pleased to discover the existence of this collection of five Bela Lugosi films which were produced in his post-Dracula heyday, before his popularity declined and he was reduced to supporting parts at the studios of Poverty Row, and an unjust obscurity considering his talent and capabilities. I had only seen two of these titles previously, 'The Raven' and 'The Black Cat' on poor transfer and was resigned to never seeing them presented properly at least in my Region, but lo and behold the wonders of Amazon!

Anyway, I am pleased to report that the digital transfer of 'Cat' and 'Raven' are an improvement on the other DVD's which I have seen. The picture is clear and crisp and the soundtracks have been considerably improved. Both these titles are classics and I believe that as time goes on and they become better known, their cult status will not have been in vain. Ulmer's 'The Black Cat' is such a joy for anyone who a) may have an  interest in German expressionism; b) is a Universal horror fan or c) knows a great piece of entertainment no matter what genre it may belong to, when they see it. The black and white cinematography is gorgeous and the production design is truly awesome. Ulmer is regarded as the Orson Welles of Poverty Row but I don't use that moniker in a condescending fashion, rather that he was capable of making something out of very little because of his talent and dedication to the film medium.

'Murders in the Rue Morgue' is a tad on the gruesome side, but must give the critics with a Freudian bent something to write about. I know nothing of the Poe story it is based upon, but it does have a wonderful atmosphere of 19th century Parisian decadence which is very appealing and done in a way that you can take it seriously and not laugh. I am only getting used to this title as it is new to me, but I think I will enjoy watching it some more. 'Black Friday' is the weakest in the collection, but it is reasonable enough if you are only looking for some escapist entertainment, as opposed to great art.

To sum up, I think this collection is good value for money, as well as a showcase for Lugosi's talent. Also, it is an interesting overview of the horror cinema of the mid 30's to 40's, before the genre suffered the crippling blow of being banned in England. Universal's resort to a number of silly sequels and parody movies that sadly are not even of the class of something as inconsequential as 'Black Friday', would indicate that this collection represents a swansong of sorts for the genre of Universal Studios horror.",1303689600,4,2567,4.54978354978355
2332456,5,B0009X770E,"There seems to be some confusion on the reviews of this superb box set. I have recently purchased it from Amazon and can confirm it includes: murders in the rue morgue, the black cat, the raven, The invisible ray and Black Friday so am unsure which box set other reviewers are referring to!

With the exception of Dracula and White Zombie the films contained in this collection, in my opinion, represent the high points of Lugosi's career. Unlike many cheaper Lugosi box sets available on Amazon this is a quality affair. The pictures are crisp and well defined with deep blacks, not light grey, whilst the audio tracks are clear and not drowned out by the 'hiss' or distortion often found on cheaper releases.

If you are a Lugosi fan and have bought, and been disappointed by cheaper box sets, this is the one that stands out from the crowd. A must buy!",1294876800,4,855,4.5816993464052285
2332457,5,B0009X770E,"Edgar G. Ulmer has a cult reputation, particularly in France. The late British film critic, Leslie Halliwell, believed that reputation to be wholly undeserved, since most of Ulmer's films ranged from B to Z status. Ulmer did not begin that way when, in 1934, he was handed ""complete freedom"" in an A (A-) production, teaming, for the first time, Universal Studio's reigning horror stars Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff in the Poe inspired The Black Cat. The resulting film, and Ulmer's affair with his employer's wife, quickly ended a promising top-notch studio career almost as quickly as it began.

This first Karloff/Lugosi teaming was also their best. That is because of their eight collaborations this was their only joint-starring project directed by a visionary auteur. In The Black Cat Lugosi was cast as protagonist Dr. Vitus Werdegast, and Karloff as antagonist Hjalmer Poelzig. In the original, uncut film, Lugosi's hero does some less than heroic things. Enough of Vitus' sinister quality remains that Lugosi gives us a hero we are never quite comfortable with. Under Ulmer's direction, Lugosi's performance is superb, an extreme rarity for this actor. As good as Lugosi is, Karloff is even better and, as unpopular as it may be to say now, Karloff was always a far better actor than his co-star.

Ulmer's ""complete freedom"" came to a screeching halt when universal execs saw the filmed footage and script. Lugosi's hero rapes the heroine, the heroine occasionally turns into a black cat, and Karloff's Poelzig is skinned alive and last seen crawling on the floor with his skin hanging from his body as Lugosi's mad hero laughs hysterically. All of these scenes were cut from the film and, par the course at that time, were destroyed. There are conflicting accounts as to whether the scenes were shot and then burned, or merely scripted and axed.

Regardless, what remains of The Black Cat is a flawed, baroque masterpiece, intoxicating to watch and simultaneously frustrating, especially in light of Ulmer's original intent. Lugosi's Hungarian psychiatrist Vitus is traveling by train, and he is on a journey of revenge and retaliation. Vitus meets two newlyweds--American novelist Peter Alison and his wife Joan (played by David Manners and Jaqueline Wells)--who are as bland a 30s couple as one is likely to find. Lugosi sees something in the young woman Joan and touches her hair as she sleeps. The Hays Code be damned, it's an erotic, sinister, yearning close-up moment, and Lugosi will never look as beautiful again. Vitus is heading towards Fort Marmorus, the scene of a great World War I battle, where he was captured and betrayed by his commander, Poelzig. Amazingly, Vitus has survived 15 years in a Serbian concentration camp, and is now intent on exacting revenge on Poelzig for this and for the additional betrayal of stealing Vitus' wife and child while he was in prison.

After departing the train, the newlyweds accompany Vitus by car, along with his creepy servant Thamal (played by Harry Cording of many a Sherlock Holmes movie). But, lo and behold, the car crashes in the rain (a badly executed and an unnecessary set-up) and the four are forced to find refuge in an old dark house. Of course, that house is none other than the home of Herr Poelzig, and what a house. Hardly the Gothic ruins of a Carfax Abbey, Poelzig's abode of the damned home looks like an art deco charnel house, designed by the Constructivists so that guests such as Franz Kafka and Edgar Munch might feel perfectly at home. When the group arrives, drenched at the front door, they are not greeted by Riff-Raff, but instead find themselves face to face with majordomo Egon Brecher (a horror film regular).

Frank-n-Furter does not appear either, but his spirit is there when the majordomo lets his master know, via a beautifully cracking and popping old intercom, that Dr. Werdegast and guests have arrived. Karloff's Poelzig sits straight up, silhouetted in a canopy bed, like an erect penis, which was certainly intentional and understandable as he was lying next to the sleeping form of the beautiful Lucille Lund (as, you guessed it, Karen Werdegast Poelzig, Karloff's wife & Lugosi's daughter).

Karloff's melodramatic appearance to the group is perfect. His Poelzig looks like he might have been designed by Oskar Schlemmer, with his satanic mane, broad shoulders, and black silk satanic pjs. Ulmer tailored Poelzig after the infamous Satan worshiper Aleister Crowley. When Poelzig meets his guests he arches an eyebrow, extends a gaunt, slithering, Grinch-like hand, smiles, and lisps precise, phony warmth--as he secretly intends for Joan to be his next sacrificial bride to almighty Lucifer. Karloff knows how to use his body to full advantage in The Black Cat. His hand grasps a statue of nude woman as he watches the Alisons kiss. He glides his finger seductively over a chess piece. Vitus knows how to read Poelzig's body language. Vitus is well aware of his rival's intent and plans to stop his diabolical scheme, while seemingly admiring Poelzig from afar.

After a bit of cat and mouse foreplay, Lugosi, with a deadly earnest delivery, utters a priceless line in response to Peter's proclamation that there is a lot of superstitious baloney afoot: ""Superstitious, perhaps. Baloney, perhaps not."" A little later, Poelzig takes Vitus to the cellar. A black cat appears and Vitus freaks out, crashing through an expressionistic paper sliding door. In the finished film, Vitus' paranoia of cats is embarrassingly ridiculous. In the original script, that paranoia was coupled with erotic fixation for the black cat. It may not be from Poe, but Edgar would have appreciated the bestiality references. As Poelzig and Vitus ascend up the stairs, it is to a macabre mix of Poelzig's narration juxtaposed against the Allegretto of Beethoven's Seventh Symphony (played here in the traditionally slow grand-guignol tempo, rather than as the rhythmic allegretto it was originally intended to be). The Black Cat is filled to the brim with art music. Brahms, Liszt, and Schubert accompany Ludwig on this film journey, and Ulmer probably knew how to juxtapose music better than any director until Kubrick came along.

A chess match (which pre-dates Bergman) between Poelzig and Vitus vying for the fate of Joan begins beautifully but is interrupted by awkward comedy relief from a pair of accident investigating constables. After the constables (thankfully) leave, Peter borrows the phone, only to find it is dead. ""Did you hear that Vitus? The phone is dead! Even the phone is dead!,"" rolls Poelzig through a delightfully, self-congratulating, menacing grin. We empathize. Oddly, the chess match resumes and goes nowhere, ending with Poelzig's easy victory almost as quickly as it began. The chess match does reveal the obsessions of very similar characters. Poelzig is well aware that Vitus plans revenge, but he is also aware that Vitus is, potentially, equally perverse: ""You better attend the ceremony tonight Vitus. It will interest you.""

Poelzig waxes nostalgic with an occasional trip to the cellar downstairs (complete with trapezoid walls) to visit his murdered, ethereal brides, embalmed in glass coffins. The dead wives include Poelzig's late wife (also played by Lucille Lund). In a moment of Oedipal envy, we find Poelzig married the mother, killed her, then married the daughter. Tim Burton`s freakery rings trite and trendy in comparison (the Penguin's ""You're just jealous because I am a genuine freak and you have to wear a mask!"" to fellow freak Batman would apply here, Mr. Burton).

Ulmer's surreal expressionist Black Cat world is, aptly, a universe which does not and has never existed. In this world, things are only bound to become more perverse. Ulmer does not disappoint. Karen finds out Daddy is still alive. Hubby rapes and kills Karen. Daddy finds his dead baby girl when he attempts to free Joan from being a Satanic sacrifice in a black mass orgy. Vitus finds Poelzig and fights him in a beautifully lit struggle of stark, expressionist blacks and whites (shot mostly in close-ups). Vitus' servant is shot and killed by Poelzig's servant, but Thamal will not die until he helps his master defeat Poelzig and tie him to the embalming rack. Thamal drops dead. Vitus seems not to care at all. So much for loyalty. Vitus sadistically rips open Poelzig's shirt and begins to skin him alive (in silhouette): ""Did you ever seen an animal skinned, Hjalmer? That's what I am going to do to you now! Vear the skin from your body, sssslooooowlyyyy, bit by bit."" That dialogue rolls of Bela's tongue beautifully, insanely. This nightmare evil all ends with a martyred Vitus, mistakenly shot by Peter for, understandably, believing Vitus was having his way with Joan, an explosion which levels the hell house, and a now dead, ""rotten"" cult. Now, Mr. Alison is free write his new novel, a mystery. Unfortunately, it was Karloff and not Manners that was tortured, Lund raped and killed instead of Wells.

Ulmer learned his trade under F.W. Marnau and Fritz Lang. It shows. With this single film, even marred by studio tampering, Ulmer can be ranked alongside Whale, Browning and Tourneur as visionary directors within a limited genre. None of the remaining Karloff/Lugosi collaborations hold up as well. Both The Raven (1935) and Son of Frankenstein (1939) had impressive moments, but both were flawed by pedestrian direction. Only The Body Snatcher (1945) could be counted as a worthy follow-up, but Lugosi, quite on the down slide by then, was reduced to little more than a cameo appearance, albeit a highly effective one.

Ulmer certainly brought his visual flair to many of his projects, but it was rarely enough to save them. Bluebeard (1944), Detour (1945) and Strange Illusion (1946) are rightly considered cult classics, while Strange Woman (1946) has some admirers. For the most part, however, Ulmer got his studio-sponsored toy train set in the career-defining Black Cat. By all accounts, Ulmer had a hell of a lot of fun playing with his train set, and reflected on it proudly, even if it did do him in. But, in the words of Vitus Werdegast, ""It's been a good game.""

2332458,5,B0009X770E,"THE BELA LUGOSI COLLECTION might be better titled THE KARLOFF-LUGOSI COLLECTION, for four of its five films co-star the duo.  While two of the films are minor and one distinctly so, all five belong to the original 1930s cycle of Universal horror classics, and at least three were so reviled by moral and civic leaders that Universal was forced to tone down its horror products--a circumstance that put an end to the studio's first golden era of fright films.  The films most widely condemned are those most widely lauded today: MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE, THE BLACK CAT, and THE RAVEN.

MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE (1932) is the only film in the set to feature Lugosi as solo star.  Very loosely based on the Poe story, the film also borrows a bit from the silent classic THE CABINET OF DR. CALIGARI in its story of a man known to the public as the side show purveyor of an ape show--who is secretly a mad scientist whose trained ape kidnaps women for ugly experiments.  Although this may be Lugosi's best overall Universal horror film after DRACULA, it has a stodgy period-costume movie quality, and certainly the ape costume is of no help.  THE BLACK CAT (1934) and THE RAVEN (1935) are certainly more glitchy, but both are better films, strange and disquieting--and both possess considerable squirm factor even to this day.  In THE BLACK CAT, Lugosi (the good guy) squares off against Karloff (the bad guy) in a film that shocked audiences because it concerned a group of devil worship cult.  The film is particularly noted for its atmospheric use of Bauhaus styles to create an oddly sterile, extremely disturbing tone.  THE RAVEN finds Lugosi (the bad guy) assisted by Karloff (a somewhat bad guy) in killing off a series of house guests according to the the stories of Edgar Allen Poe--well, kinda sorta.  The tortures are inventive, and the film was considered so entirely unacceptable that England and many other European countries banned it outright.

The two lesser films are not as memorable but entertaining nonetheless.  THE INVISIBLE RAY (1936) finds Lugosi (the good guy) attempting to prevent a radiation-from-outer-space-contaminated Karloff (the bad guy) from killing everyone who annoys him with via contaminating them with a single touch.  BLACK FRIDAY (1940) has a convoluted plot in which both Karloff and Lugosi are bad guys, with Karloff in the lead as a surgeon who becomes involved in a partial brain transplant operation and Lugosi in the minor role who is suffocated inside a closet.  It is trivial but reasonably amusing.

There have been complaints about the quality of the films and the DVD itself.  I must say that, while the films have not been given a digital refurbish, the prints are largely pristine, and I myself encountered no issue with the DVD.  One word of warning: this is one of those hated double-sided DVDs, three films on one side and two on the other.  But other than that, Lugosi and Karloff fans will be thrilled.

2332459,4,B0009X770E,"This is a review for the BELA LUGOSI COLLECTION, a set of five vintage horror movies featuing Bela Lugosi released by Universal Pictures in a  one DVD collection.
 I rate this set of vintage  b&w talkies 4 1/2 stars out of a possible 5 stars because of the fact that all five films are on one disc.  Surely Universal could have made a two disc set just to avoid the inconvenience and potential scratching of a two sided disc.

All that aside, I believe that these five films are as fine a collection of spine tinglers that the consumer can buy from the orignal studio for a very low price.
The picture quality and the sound are probably as good as is possible 70 to almost 80 years after the original relaese of these pictures.

Every title in this collection features Bela Lugosi, mostly as a co-star to Boris Karloff,
who was ""the name above the title in four out of five of these films. The exception being:

THE MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE (1932) dby Robert Florey with Mr. Florey doing an adaptation of the Poe story including additional dialogue by John Huston. Sydney Fox, Bela Lugosi and Leon Ames star in this drama set in 19th century Paris where women are kidnapped and murdered for use in scientific experiments.  I don't have to say who done it, nor will I give away any more details except to remark that this is a fine, atmosphereric film that I am happy I had the chance to see again.

THE BLACK CAT (1934) dby Edgar G. Ulmer.  Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, David Manners, Julie Bishop. Another Poe title that has little to do with the work entitled ""The Black Cat."" This cat has to do with a young couple crossing Europe having a bus accident and with their fellow passenger played by Bela Lugosi, spend the night in an elaborately ultra modernistic but isolated home built, owned and occupied by a character played by Boris Karloff.
A wonderful movie, filled with creepy atmosphere and puzzling incidents, until all
is gradually revealed before THE END.

THE RAVEN (1935) dby Lew Landers. Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Lester Mathews, Irene Ware.
Another Poe title adaptation this story again has little to do with the actual Poe poem but involves a doctor, played by Bela Lugosi, who is  a great admirere of the Poe work and how he is forced to help escaped murderer Karloff with an appearance changing operation. This fast paced ""B"" movie is definitely a bit below par compared to the first two films in this set but is very entertaining and eminently rewatchable. Well done,
quite enjoyable.

THE INVISIBLE RAY (1936) dby Lambert Hillyer. Boris Karloss, Bella Lugosi, Francis Drake,
Frank Lawton.  This film is a modernistic mix of suspense, horror and science fiction with
the emphasis on horror but still a nice blend of all the elements.  Excellent performances (as usual) by Lugosi and Karloff and really well done special effects considering this is a 1936 production. And considering that this film as of now is 73 years old it holds up pretty well. Very well done and more than enough to hold one's interest through repeated occasional viewings.

BLACK FRIDAY (1940) dby Arthur Lubin. Boris karloff, Bela Lugosi, Stanley Ridges, Anne Nagle, Anne Gwynn.  Screenplay co-authored by Curt Siodmak. Karloff, in another mad scientist role, gives his brain dead friend a brain transplant using a well-known gangster's ear separator.  Both the gangster and the meek professor in need of a new brain are played by Stanley Ridges, who pretty much is the actual star of this
quickie. Karloff is superb as the doctor and Bela Lugosi is excellent as a gangster but this fast moving 'B"" picture does not have much time for anything other than quick
moving plot developments and a not too surprising finish.  Very entertaining, and
the stars do a believable job in this somewhat unbelievable film.

THE BELA LUGOSI COLLECTION is a top quality collection, well worth the viewer's time and
money. Incidentally, there's not much in the way of extras in this set save some coming atractions.  Only two of these titles are somewhat famous in the horror genre but all of them are entertaining and worth watching more than once.",1260921600,6,4128,4.729428172942817

This film features the first on-screen pairing of Karloff and Lugosi.  Despite its reputation as a landmark horror film, I found it to be a major disappointment.  The plot is ridiculous and incoherent, the acting is stiffer than a starched shirt, and the climax is ""anti-""!!!  A freshly married couple(Manners and Wells) are on a train heading for some unpronounceable destination in Hungary.  Due to a ""booking mistake"", they find themselves sharing their compartment with Lugosi, who plays an ""eminent"" psychiatrist.  By the damnedest coincidence, they are all headed for the same place---the newlyweds to honeymoon---the shrink to ""visit an old friend""(played by Karloff).  When they arrive at their destination, it's raining ""cats and dogs"", so they share a horse-drawn ""taxi"".  The ""taxi"" flips over in the storm killing the driver and leaving the three travelers stranded in the deluge.  By another coincidence, the home of Lugosi's friend is nearby so they all head for shelter there.  They are  welcomed by Karloff(who happens to be an ""eminent"" architect) and then things really get bizarre.  We learn that Lugosi and Karloff had served together in WWI and that Karloff had betrayed his unit to the enemy so that he could get Lugosi's wife and daughter for himself; Lugosi escaped a massacre but was thrown into prison where he has languished for the past 15 years.  In the interim, Karloff has built an extravagant house on the site of the gun emplacements where the betrayal took place!!!  We also discover that Lugosi's wife died two years earlier but Karloff(who happens to be a Satan worshiper) has kept her corpse perfectly preserved and is now married to Lugosi's daughter!  What a surprise when we  learn that Lugosi has not come to pay a ""social call"" but to extract revenge on Karloff for ""cutting up"" the way he has.  Karloff plans to conduct a Satanic ritual that will transfer the ""life""(I think) of the newlywed bride to his wife(Lugosi's daughter) in order to ""keep her young"".  Lugosi and the groom eventually manage to foil Karloff's plans, the newlyweds escape, and Lugosi blows himself and Karloff up(it seems that not only did Karloff build his house over the old gun emplacements, but also over an underground stash of dynamite!!!!!!).  If this synopsis has you confused, try watching the movie---I kept it simple!!!  This is truly an awful film, given the stars and the reputation it has garnered over the years.  The best things about the movie are the ""over the top"" Art-Deco sets.  As a general rule, I'm a fan of Edward G. Ulmer---his films are always a little ""out there"", but he has made some movies that I really like, e.g., STRANGE ILLUSION; DETOUR(a terrific little film noir); and RUTHLESS.  However, he went totally ""off the reservation"" with this turkey---it is so full of plot inconsistencies, non-sequiturs, and truly awful acting that I regret buying it.  By the way, the film takes its title from the fact that Lugosi suffers from a pathological fear of---you guessed it---black cats!",1257638400,4,3208,5.057034220532319

The film tells the story of a mad scientist -played by you-know-who- working at a sideshow who intends to create a human-ape hybrid race by injecting women with his captive ape's blood. Lugosi is a smooth operator if more then a little creepy trying to move in on his female of choice, but is probably a crummy scientist considering the rest of the women he attempted his experiment on all died.  Definition of insanity and all that, I suppose.  Apparently a whole lot of violence was cut out of this film which is a real shame because the original material has not been restored and it really could have made this one close to perfect.

""The Black Cat"" is a great film.  A terrible excuse to invoke the works of Poe, but still very enjoyable.  The title creature appears all of twice (maybe thrice) and has no effect on the story except for invoking comically exaggerated displays of fear from Lugosi.  This was the first of several Karloff vs Lugosi films and aong the best that I've seen of the lot.  Lugosi plays a war survivor whose comrades were wiped out due to a betrayal by his superior officer (Karloff).  Two innocent travelers wind up being thrust in the middle of the vendetta and the way it plays out is really extraordinary.  This is the most despicable Karloff role I've ever seen and it was nice to see Lugosi play the hero.
4 1/2 stars

While ""The Raven"" has little to do with the immortal poem everybody knows by heart, it is one of the best film tributes to Edgar Allen Poe that I've come across.  And coming from a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vincent-Price/dp/B000SK5ZFM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vincent Price</a>&nbsp;fanatic, that is saying a lot.  Lugosi plays a surgeon obsessed with the works of the macabre poet who is prodded into saving the life of a beautiful young lady, who he easily falls for.  But the lady is spoken for.  Karloff plays an escaped murder who implores the doctor to change his face, and he does...to resemble half-disfigured Batman villain Two Face.  He then orders the crook to help him do that which he has already done: take a life.  The opposition are treated to a gallery of Poe-inspired torture devices (yes, there is both a pit and a pendulum) and Karloff's character has to decide between redemption and damnation. There is a very memorable performance where Lugosi gives some fantastic insight into the psychology of Poe's works and of course recites some of the title poem as well, which is a treat.
5 stars

""The Invisible Ray"" is a science fiction film with a touch (so to speak) of horror to it where Lugosi again got to play the hero.  It's the longest film in the set at about 80 minutes and it doesn't waste it.  Karloff gets to give the mad scientist role a go this time and does a predictably great job.  The sci-fi aspect really makes this one stand out and the idea of looking at rays of light as possible doorways to the past was well ahead of it's time.  After all, the light we see from stars has been traveling for million of years or more.  Think about if we could somehow see images of the things that a ray of light has been privy to in it's voyage.  Anyways, Karloff uses this notion in a fairly backwards way to glimpse an intergalactic asteroid striking Earth in the distant past.  Hunting the asteroid down -having seen where it hit- with a group including a respectful professional rival played by Lugosi, he discovers that the meteor contained a new element with amazing properties.  Karloff's character vanishes and is presumed dead, reappearing years later and finding that his fiance has married another and his rival has used his discovery's properties to heal the sick and become famous. Can somebody say ""insane radiation-fueled vengeance spree""?  Great flick.
4 1/2 stars

""Black Friday"" is the weakest of the set and features both Karloff and Lugosi, but neither in starring roles.  This one combines the gangster film genre with science fiction for an intriguing mix.  As fate has it, a mild-mannered professor is run down during a gang shootout that leaves a mob boss dead at the hands of his own crew.  Karloff plays a doctor who uses the slain mobster's brain to somehow save the prof's life. If anybody should know that messing around with criminal brains is a bad idea, it's Boris Karloff. Anyways, the result is a split personality, a hunt for the mobster's hidden fortune, and some payback along the way.  Lugosi's role as a gangster is too small for this to be included in a boxed set of his films, but the movie itself is worth watching for old school sci-fi fans.  Stanley Ridges easily acts circles around his legendary co-stars and really puts on the best performance in this set playing two very different characters in the same body.  But the whole thing is played a bit farfetched and the story lags at times.
3 stars

Bela Lugosi is one of the most unique and evocative screen presences in the history of cinema.  How many time have you personally mimicked his unforgettable Hungarian accent?  When you think of the perfect onscreen vampire, whose is the very first face you picture?  Karloff may have gotten all of the love, but it's Lugosi who remains my favorite actor of the 30's and 40's.  A true one-of-a-kind who left a stamp on the horror genre that has only become more pronounced with time.  He's bee the subject of songs, depicted and referenced in books and movies, and despite his career hardships, has risen from the grave to achieve true immortality as a cinema icon like no other. The films on this disc may not be his most famous works, but they are necessary viewing.  At this price, this set is a no-brainer.  Enjoy.",1245456000,3,6552,4.762621789193977
2332467,5,B0009X770E,"Anyone interested in the Universal Horror cycle of the 1930s outside of DRACULA and FRANKENSTEIN or in the career of Bela Lugosi needs to have or at least rent this set which rates a full 5 stars thanks to beautiful transfers. It contains one bona fide classic (THE BLACK CAT - 1934), 2 very good films (THE RAVEN - 1935, THE INVISIBLE RAY - 1936), one ho-hum effort from late in the game (BLACK FRIDAY - 1940), and one fascinating misfire (MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE - 1932). It is this last film that I'm primarily interested in as it is the least known of the set and a classic case of studio interference ruining a potential masterpiece.

After preparing the original FRANKENSTEIN project only to have it handed to James Whale (who retained the idea of the stolen criminal brain), original director Robert Florey and star Bela Lugosi (who rejected the part of the Monster because it had no dialogue) were given this film as a consolation prize. Florey wanted to create an American CABINET OF DR CALIGARI. He had the great cameraman Karl Freund and together they created a bizarre shadowy Paris that is almost overbearingly atmospheric. Lugosi threw himself into the role of Dr Mirakle with remarkable intensity and what should have emerged from all this was an American expressionist classic. It wasn't and the book UNIVERSAL HORRORS explains what happened.

The finished film was shown to the Universal top brass and they didn't like it. Too humorless and too arty. So they had comic relief scenes with dialogue by a young John Huston added, close-ups of a chimpanzee inserted (the story is about a gorilla) and then rearranged Florey's existing order of scenes. The film was then cut from 72 to 61 minutes removing footage considered too disturbing. The end result was a terrible mess that barely resembles what Florey envisioned. However there are several moments which still make the film worthwhile. Lugosi's performance, Karl Freund's camerawork, and a surprisingly effective performance from Arlene Francis of WHAT'S MY LINE fame. It's a pity that we will never see what Robert Florey intended but what is left is still fascinating in spite of everything that happened.",1244419200,4,2179,4.902439024390244
2332468,5,B0009X770E,"These five titles are good examples of Universal horror films both before and after the code. However, there is a little matter of truth in advertising to discuss. This is really more of a Lugosi/Karloff collection than a Lugosi collection. In fact, only one film does not feature both actors - ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"". Of the other four, two have Karloff and Lugosi on a fairly equal footing - ""The Raven"" and ""The Black Cat"", which are the best of the films. The other two - ""The Invisible Ray"" and ""Black Friday"" are really Karloff films. ""Black Friday"" really only has Lugosi as a bit player - Karloff is the star of that film.

All five feature the atmosphere and pacing that are unique to the Universal horror films of the time. I would say I found 1932's ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" to be the least satisfactory of the films. The atmosphere is great, and Lugosi does one of the things he does best - play a sophistocated and charming madman. Lugosi has somehow managed to mix up ideas of evolution (man and ape being related) with religious ideals of pure blood only coming from virgins - thus his obsession with Camille, a girl he sees at the carnival where he exhibits his ape and speaks of his beliefs. The distracting part of the film consists of the love scenes between Camille and Pierre (Leon Ames). Later in his career Ames excelled at playing a sophistocated cad in the Warren William tradition, but here he just annoys me.

1934's ""The Black Cat"" changes things a bit and has Lugosi playing the hero for a change. Karloff plays a devil-worshiping priest who has a habit of preserving and displaying the bodies of his late wives in the basement of his castle. He has had Vitus Werdegast (Lugosi) imprisoned and stolen his wife. When Lugosi escapes fifteen years later, he returns for revenge and to retrieve the wife and infant daughter he left behind. Throw into the mix a honeymooning couple that is stranded at Karloff's castle and you have not so much a mystery but a chance for some really great moments between Lugosi and Karloff as they face off.

1935's ""The Raven"" has Lugosi again playing the charming madman. However here he is a legitimate man of science - brilliant surgeon, Dr. Villon. He saves the life of a young girl by performing emergency surgery on her and falls in love with her. Her father, Judge Thatcher, comes to Villon and tries to convince him that the relationship will never work. Angered that he is good enough to save his daughter's life but not to marry her, he plots a creative Poe-like revenge.

In 1936's ""The Invisible Ray"", Lugosi is again the good guy. He plays Dr. Felix Benet, who invites Dr. Janos Rukh (Karloff) on a scientific expedition to Africa. There Rukh discovers a powerful substance that has the power both to cure and destroy. When Rukh becomes infected with the substance he discovers he becomes mad with his own power to destroy, especially when he feels that he's been robbed by the expedition of both his wife and his discovery.

1940's ""Black Friday"" doesn't really fit with the other four, but it is still a very good film. It really is a noir more than it is a horror film. Karloff stars as brain surgeon Ernest Sovac. His good friend is run down by a gangster's car after that gangster is shot by his own mob. The gangster has a broken body as a result of the accident. Sovac's friend's brain is damaged to the point that he is dying. Sovac performs brain surgery and transplants part of the gangster's brain into his friend. He does this partly to save his friend and partly in hope of getting his hands on the money that the gangster has hidden from his mob. Lugosi plays a member of that mob and is not onscreen for very long.

This DVD is highly recommended to fans of Karloff, Lugosi, and Universal horror. The downside is that the films are on one dual-sided disc and there are absolutely no extras. However, the video and audio quality are excellent on all of the films.",1228348800,,3957,4.542776998597476
2332469,5,B0009X770E,"I've wanted a copy of the The Black Cat for years and years because of some of the background music that it possibly contained.
  I was not born yet when The Black Cat first came out, but saw it once, at a very young age in the late 1960's or 1970's, on the old Thriller Theater, I think, hosted by a local celeb Count Gregore in Oklahoma city years after the movie came out on a late night horror movie offering.  It had a song in it that sounded familiar to me.
  The background song I was searching for was an old contest song I sang all the way back in junior high school.  The title may be something like Roses At Night and sure enough there it was in instrumental version in the first scene where Boris Karloff in off to nighty-night with Bela's former wife.
  I had always heard that this was the one movie that Lugosi did not play  ""the heavy"" in and was glad I got to see two of my heroes in one movie.
  I would suggest this collection as a primer for anyone who doesn't have much experience with the classics in horror by Lugosi, Karloff or Price.  It is also great for those of us who still are enchanted by the old black and white anthems of good verses evil.",1227312000,2,1172,4.11453744493392

2332472,5,B0009X770E,"I just wanted to drop in here and voice my profound enthusiasm for ""The Invisible Ray"" (1936), which is perhaps the most obscure film of the entire package, and which stars both Boris Karloff (as Dr. Janos Rukh) and Bela Lugosi (as Dr. Felix Benet).

This one is an actual treasure among B-films -- it's a sci-fi, jungle movie, murder mystery all in one! And you'll never see either Karloff or Lugosi look better than they do here. In fact, Lugosi (with his goat-tee beard) looks astoundingly like the handsome Robert De Niro in the wedding scene of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Deer-Hunter/dp/0783225997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Deer Hunter</a>! This is also one of the few films where you'll see Lugosi playing the good guy.

THIS STORY is a lot more complex (but very coherent) than what we're accustomed to in comparable old sci-fi films. It begins in Dr. Rukh's mansion observatory in the Carpathian Mountains where he resides with his blind mother (Violet Kemble Cooper) and with his lovely young wife, Diane (whom they mostly call ""Diana"" throughout the film, played by the lovely Frances Drake). It's a dark and stormy night when guests arrive to whom Dr. Rukh has a visionary theory to prove.

Dr. Rukh's guests include Sir Francis Stevens (Walter Kingsford,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Algiers/dp/B00006II5I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Algiers</a>), his wife Lady Arabella Stevens (Beulah Bondi,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mr-Smith-Goes-to-Washington/dp/B00003L9CJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</a>), Dr. Benet, and Arabella's nephew, Ronald Drake (played by Frank Lawton). Rukh's wife and Mother Rukh are both very supportive of Dr. Rukh's incredible theory while the newly-arrived house guests are initially all skeptical.

Dr. Rukh guides the entire group into his observatory where, as they look on, he ""captures"" a ray of light which ultimately reveals, in a hologram show (in his adjacent lab where there is all manner of cool Frankenstein-ish electronic gewgaws), past astronomical events concerning the Earth, and specifically that a significant meteor once came from the Andromeda Nebula and impacted the Earth in the wilds of Africa! (The special effects on this are incredibly well-done.)

Having impressed his guests with his astounding results, Dr. Rukh agrees to accompany an already planned expedition of Benet's and Stevens' to Nigeria in an attempt to locate a sample of ""Radium-X"" which was the powerful atomic element in the meteor. All present go on the expedition except for Mother Rukh who ominously warns her son against the trip.

In the African Jungle, Dr. Rukh leaves the main camp to search for the Radium-X impact site, a spot which he locates in 8 weeks while the others remain at the main campsite, carrying out their own priorities. With the aid of his native assistants he rigs up a pulley system in which he can be lowered into a cave of flaming Hellfire to possibly collect a sample, fully protected in a radiation-proof suit. He gets his sample but he somehow still receives radiation poisoning -- in fact, any living thing he touches dies immediately as Dr. Rukh glows brightly in the dark! Dr. Rukh also develops an atomic ray gun at his campsite which he demonstrates for his native helpers by ""melting"" a huge rock, mostly in an effort to coerce them into not running away.

Dr. Rukh's wife, Diana, rushes through the wilds to his side when she hears where he is located but he immediately tells her to go away as he remains hidden and glowing in the dark of his tent's interior. She returns to the main camp, emotionally devastated and Dr. Rukh also sneaks back to the main camp to seek Dr. Benet's assistance in developing a cure for his radiation poisoning. Dr. Benet bails him out but the cure is only a temporary one and Dr. Rukh has to inject himself regularly to keep from exuding the poisonous atomic rays and killing whomever he touches. And there's another caveat -- while Dr. Rukh returns to his discovery site for a few weeks to recover more Radium-X, his wife (Diane) and Arabella's nephew (Ronald) fall in love. Diane remains faithful to her husband but she is clearly unhappy.

The group eventually returns to civilization and Dr. Rukh immediately uses a tiny exposure of his Radium-X ray to cure his mother's blindness. Then the scene switches to Paris where, knowing of Dr. Rukh's success with his mother, Dr. Benet begins curing thousands of people with various afflictions (including blindness) with the atomic ray. Dr. Rukh also goes to Paris and there he begins to go a bit mad. He had been warned of this possibility by Dr. Benet back in Africa. In any case, Dr. Rukh sees it that people have ""stolen"" from him. Dr. Benet has heisted his secret ray and Ronald Drake has stolen the love of his wife... in fact, Dr. Rukh suspects his wife of having cheated (which she did not).

So, in a mad, paranoid scheme, Dr. Rukh lures a man away from a pub who is about his own size, and then he fakes his own death by killing this unfortunate fellow, mutilating the body beyond clear recognition. The funeral is held and it's not long after this that we see the widow Rukh and the young and handsome Ronald Drake getting married! Dr. Rukh watches the ceremony from a dark corner and it's clear that he's going to seek vengeance. The first to die from Dr. Rukh's poisonous touch is Sir Francis Stevens. All Dr. Rukh has to do is to avoid injecting himself and when he begins to glow, it's ""LOOK OUT!"" for anyone he touches.

I absolutely must stop there to avoid a revelation/spoiler of the ending which is just as good as the body of the film. It all sounds far-fetched, I realize, but this one really flows with plenty of activity and enough action to keep it from dragging. The sets and locations are especially excellent.

This movie is, of course, in black-and-white, full-frame, and runs for 80 minutes. It was directed by Lambert Hillyer, (a prolific and talented director who did over 160 films and wrote the screenplays for many more.) The Screenplay was written by John Colton, based upon an original story by Howard Higgin and Douglas Hodges. The Musical score is a very good one and was composed by Franz Waxman. Finally, all the superb special effects were pulled off by John P. Fulton (special cinematographer) and Raymond Lindsay (who was uncredited.)

If this film has a weak link it's simply that Frank Lawton was perhaps poorly cast as he's just too diminutive a character to ever convincingly steal a wife away from the imposing persona of Karloff. But still, Lawton played his role to the pinnacle so this is a very minor criticism. There is also the scene of the meteor entering Earth's atmosphere and striking southern Africa, a good 1000 miles from Nigeria which is where the expedition supposedly went -- but again, this is nothing more than minor impedimenta.

I was especially impressed with the beauty of the brunette Frances Drake (Diane) with her slightly droopy and wide-set bedroom eyes and perfect features. She reminded me quite a lot of the striking and renowned Marie Windsor (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Outpost-in-Morocco/dp/B00008H2GM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Outpost in Morocco</a>.)

Despite the fact that Lugosi received second billing and Karloff's name was inscribed in taller letters the two favorites did a great job.

Due to the combined nature of the story line it could be considered both classic horror and sci-fi. The original story, sets, graphics, music and dialog were all excellent and exactly what one would expect from Universal. In addition I think that this was one of Lugosi's best performances. None of the usually leveled complaints against Lugosi's acting skills could be raised on this occasion and his performance was excellent.

Although some of the story elements regarding all of history being recorded on a light wave from distant Andromeda appear to be nonsense, this has never stopped sci-fi or horror from telling a good story. The DVD transfer was good, although not excellent and I am certainly glad the promoters of this DVD decided to include this particular film with the box set.

Both are highlighted here in 5 different films that allow them to share the spotlight and explore some fairly meaty roles. Especially in the ""The Black Cat"" A particularly subtle yet brutal horror tale pitting Lugosi against Karloff in a twisted psychological battle of revenge, mysticism and devil worship. Very much ahead of it's time in both subject matter and brutality. The makeup, set design, mood and lighting are quite memorable.

All 5 movies though are quite enjoyable, and while tame compared to today's horror fare, they still explore some weighty subjects with an appropriate amount of abject horror and suspense.

It's fun to review some of the details of each of these movies, and pick out small little mistakes and missed edits. A particular example is seen in ""The Invisible Ray"" watch closely as Walter Kingsford as he plays a murdered Sir Francis Stevens. He is lying on the bed as Lugosi shines a bright light into his face to snap a couple of photos. After Lugosi turns off the bright light, Kigsford obviously blinks his eyes, even though he's supposed to already be dead. pretty funny, and the first time I watched the movie, I could hardly believe the obvious mistake.

This opening is shown on several films in the Bela Lugosi Collection, which is just another little perk in a generally decent set.

Three of the movies (all on Side One of the single disc) are loosely based on Edgar Allan Poe stories.  In Murders in the Rue Morgue, Lugosi plays a demented showman at a circus.  His show features an ape that is willing to kill for his master.  Lugosi also has an obsession with creating some sort of ape-human hybrid, and if a few women need to die in the process, so be it.  Although not the most well-written of movies, it does have a nice look to it, with that eerie German Expressionist influence that is seen in other horror films of the period.  This is also the only film in the set that doesn't also include Boris Karloff.

The Black Cat has Lugosi in a more heroic role as a man out for vengeance against Karloff's villainous Satanist, who years earlier had committed a treasonous act that led to Lugosi's imprisonment.  Now Lugosi and a honeymooning couple are at Karloff's estate where both characters plot against each other.  In a nice contrast to the standard old dark houses, the setting for this film is a futuristic mansion.

The Raven has Lugosi returning to evil as a doctor obsessed with a woman whose life he has saved.  He also is an avid Poe fan, leading him to set up some nasty traps (especially a deadly pendulum).  Karloff is a fugitive who is forced to help Lugosi in his schemes.  These are probably Lugosi's and Karloff's best roles in the set.

The Side Two movies put Lugosi in distinctly supporting roles.  The Invisible Ray features Karloff as a scientist who is irradiated by a strange element, one that threatens to kill him, but also gives him a lethal touch and a homicidal mania.  Lugosi plays a doctor again, this time one who creates a serum that offsets the effect of the radiation.  The science is awful, but the movie itself is fun.

The final film, Black Friday, has Lugosi in a minor role as a gangster.  Karloff plays one of his mad scientist roles, this time a brain surgeon who transplants part of a gangster's brain into his dying friend's.  Here the acting laurels go to Stanley Ridge's as the man whose personality alternates between kindly literature professor and vicious gangster.

In the horror films of the `30s and '40s, Lugosi often played second fiddle to Karloff, and this set demonstrates why.  Although Karloff himself is not at his best, he is definitely more skilled than Lugosi.  That's not to say Lugosi is bad, but he can't steal a show the way Karloff can.  As a Lugosi showcase, this is merely okay (and there aren't much in the way of extras) but the movies themselves are pretty fun.  As a whole, this set gets a low four stars and should be enjoyed by fans of the classic era of Universal horror films.",1170547200,6,3005,4.549348230912477

I had never seen them before but being a Universal Horror Film buff I found constant referrals to these films and knowing that they held both Bela Lugosi and Boris Karloff I could hardly wait to get this DVD collection in the mail. And I was not disappointed. They are a true Horror Film/Bela Lugosi delight. The Black Cat was truly creepy and disturbing. This collection holds a treasured spot on my shelf between the Dracula Legacy Collection and The Creature From the Black Lagoon Legacy Collection.,1168473600,3,592,4.647619047619048
2332544,5,B0009X770E,"This collection is a must for ALL Lugosi fans.

The very best of these movies in my opinion is The Black Cat. This is one of the movies in which Lugosi and Karloff share billing. Lugosi plays a sympathetic character in the film,Dr. Verdagast. Its sets are highly stylized,the acting is very good. Its about a Satanic cult,whose leader is Karloff. Lugosi and his fellow traveling companions are stranded and held captive by Karloff. Lugosi ends up saving everyone,killing Karloffs character,but ending up dead himself.

The other great movie in this collection is The Raven,with Karloff sharing the billing as well. It is based upon Edgar Allen Poe's classic poem.

The Invisible Ray is another film co-starring Karloff. It is cheesy by todays standards. Its about a mad scientist (Karloff) who wants to destroy his enemies with this fluorescent device. I have to admit that the premise is rather tacky,but overall its still worth watching.

I am an unabashed fan of Lugosi, and highly recommend other fan's purchase this priceless collection, as it contains his A list films produced out of Universal.",1161734400,3,1101,5.032967032967033
2332545,4,B0009X770E,"These represent the Universal films outside the ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"" franchises that starred Bela Lugosi--or more accurately, Karloff and Lugosi in all but one. Once Karloff entered the Universal scene a few months after ""Dracula"" (1931) and created such a hit with the Frankenstein monster--eclipsing Lugosi's Dracula, the studio wasn't keen to feature Lugosi as their horror star any longer: very ungrateful of them. So it leaves a ""Lugosi Collection"" from Universal largely as pairings with Karloff. ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"" (1932) is exclusively a Lugosi vehicle. In ""The Black Cat"" (1934), the two are matched. Lugosi dominates in ""The Raven"" (1935), while ""The Invisible Ray"" (1936) is more a Karloff vehicle. ""Black Friday' (1940), by far the weakest film, shouldn't be here at all, as Lugosi only has a small role.

Since others have already spoken at length about the films, and since most people buying this two-sided disc know what they're getting, I want to address the DVD mastering problems experienced. Many have noted that, regardless of player, films on the disc pixelate and freeze at random points. This is a problem with Universal's DVD-18 mastering process, which has flaws that have since caused Universal to return to their earlier, more reliable DVD-9 process.

In the meantime, both this disc and the 2-DVD ""The Hammer Horror Series"" have more than their share of bad discs. Contacting Universal itself will serve no purpose: even though they are aware of the problem, the pressings are out there and are not being remastered. You just have to be persistent and keep exchanging defective copies at retailers--even if you have to get a refund and start again with another dealer; the films are worth it. Eventually, you *will* get one without glitches. It took me three copies from two places for both this and ""The Hammer Horror Series."" Importantly, you don't have to play through all the films in real time to know if you have a flawed copy: just scan through the films in the player at 4x-10x speed (no faster), and if there is a glitch, the player will freeze at the spot. That way, you don't have to watch through eight 90-minute movies on every copy you try out; it will take only 10% of the time to check the set, and you don't even have to be in the room. If you come back and the image is frozen, rather than having finished the film being scanned and having returned to the menu, then you have a bad one.",1160265600,201,2450,4.803317535545023
2332546,4,B0009X770E,"It's almost universally acknowledged that the best Lugosi/Karloff collaboration was the 1934 version of THE BLACK CAT.  Next to their signature roles as Dracula and Frankenstein, it's probably the best acting work either of them did for Universal.  Personally, I would have gladly paid this modest price just for THE BLACK CAT.

I think the biggest letdown of this bunch was MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE.  The brand name of Bela Lugosi was still at an all-time high when he made this film, along with WHITE ZOMBIE (for an independent studio).  But the script is just dreadful.  In a way, I suppose MURDERS foretold the low-budget horror cycle of the early 40's, which often centered around apes (?). . .and which, of course, often featured Lugosi.

Though he's a supporting player in 3 out of the 5 features here, Bela holds his own against Karloff in the odd sci-fi thriller THE INVISIBLE RAY.  If it lacks the sparkle and storytelling integrity of Universal's classic monster films, it still stands up well alongside the studio's horror output of the mid 30's ( e.g.,Werewolf of London, Dracula's Daughter)

The remaining two films, THE RAVEN and BLACK FRIDAY, are low-budget programmers that succeed almost solely on the marquee value of their stars.  Karloff would make more competently-mounted ""mad doctor"" pictures for Columbia in the forties; Lugosi would slide into Hollywood's ""poverty row"" with cheap (though, in the minds of many fans, more entertaining) fare like THE DEVIL BAT, INVISIBLE GHOST and THE CORPSE VANISHES.

Karloff or Lugosi fan--and there's no reason why a person can't be BOTH--there's plenty here to enjoy.  As with all Universal's classic films on DVD, the restoration is first-rate.  Most of the films have trailers, but that's it for extras.

For the price, this collection is a must-have for fans of these types of films.",1146182400,8,1851,5.006535947712418

2332548,5,B0009X770E,"Out of courtesy, I usually don't take exception to other reviewers.  But come on folks, let's lighten up! Universal has released on one DVD a number of commercially problematic films by the Great (and I do mean Great) Bela Lugosi. This disc played just fine on my dvd player (and it's far from top of the line) and both picture and sound looked fine. Only one film in this collection is a genuine classic, 1934's THE BLACK CAT. The others are interesting, fascinating, perhaps even minor classics but how many of us would risk OUR money issuing these films in DVD hoping to make a profit? So I commend Universal for making these minor gems available at all. Thanks to the miracles of modern technology, they look just fine.

The best of the remaining four is 1936's The Invisible Ray, an early attempt at sci-fi and an uncanny anticipation of the laser beam. I am surprised and disappointed with the number of reviewers here who have misstated the plot line, making it sound absurd as a result. The film starts off like a typical Universal Gothic horror film of the early 1930s, then morphs into an adventure film in deepest Africa.  It's a hoot to see Karloff & Lugosi doing the safari routine but it works! The final third switches locales to Paris and becomes a murder mystery with a genuinely thrilling finale that rivals the best of the Universal horror classics. The special effects are remarkable, considering that the Universal horror films of this era had almost no special effects to begin with.

True, Karloff is THE star here and Lugosi plays in support - but I suggest that Lugosi has the more interesting role as a truly dedicated (and sympathetic) scientist. His character evolves as the plot develops - a good sign of a thoughtful performance.  He is high handed at first but as he uses Karloff's discovery (for which he gives Karloff complete credit) to cure diseases, he transforms into a humanitarian. Karloff is fine too but in a rather predictable performance as the well-meaning but misunderstood (and ill-fated) scientist. It is Lugosi who is the surprise here, not Karloff.  By the way, THE INVISIBLE RAY features a beautiful but neglected music score by Franz Waxman.

The remaining films are a mixed bag. 1932's MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE was Universal's followup to Lugosi's success in DRACULA. Very much an artsy film (to a fault I might add), the story is too bizarre for its own good. A starring vehicle for Lugosi, it anticipates his Monogram turkeys of a decade later such as THE APE MAN.

1935's THE RAVEN is the followup to THE BLACK CAT in this collection. If you're expecting another BLACK CAT, you'll be sorely disappointed. Lugosi plays a mad doctor in his worst, hammiest manner and Karloff is wasted in support. The film is amusing if one approaches it as Universal's attempt to spoof Lugosi's Monogram films of the 1940s.  Obviously that could not have been the intention - but it sure looks that way!

1940's BLACK FRIDAY shows that somebody at Universal was trying to be original but there apparently wasn't time (or intelligence) to fully think this project out. The REAL star of this film is Stanley Ridges who plays a kindly professor who is given a gangster's brain by Dr. Karloff. Ridges manages to steal the film from Karloff (no small feat!) with his Jekyll/Hyde role but I'd love to peak at the studio's files for this film (if they still exist). I'll bet that Lugosi was meant for the Karloff role, and Karloff was meant for the Ridges role. Then Ridges, who was a respected stage actor who was just starting to appear in films, may have become available and the casting was changed with poor Bela, contracted for the film, given a bone with the minor gangster character.

Finally, I researched Mr. Lugosi for a potential bio some years ago and I wasn't pleased with what I learned about him. In many respects, he was his own worst enemy. He refused to learn English sufficiently well and lived in Hungarian communities where he didn't have to speak English. His command of the language was iffy and he didn't respond well to changes in dialogue in making films. Obviously, this didn't endear him to directors so despite Bela's talent, he slipped down fairly quickly.  Lugosi was also a bad judge of scripts and did not distinguish between working for major studios and picking up a paycheck from poverty row studios. This hurt the value of his name perhaps more than he ever realized. At any rate, this Universal Collection offers Bela in some of his better films during his prime years in Hollywood and I for one am appreciative.  Nice price too!",1144195200,8,4599,4.712328767123288

2332582,2,B0009X770E,"While it's great to see these films on DVD, once again Universal shows it's complete lack of respect and care for their own classic films. This should come as no surprise after Universal released the classic monsters film library via shoddy, pooly packaged DVD collections that were primarily designed to promote ""Van Helsing,"" a film that crapped all over the original monster classics and stunk so bad audiences got a pre-emptive whiff without even buying a ticket. There must be no one left at the studio that gives a damn about these films, which is far more than simply just a shame. While ""Murders in the Rue Mourge"" (the second best film in the bunch) is a terrific print, ""The Black Cat"" has had ZERO efffort put into it's transfer - it is virually indistinguishable from the VHS tape (combo with ""the Raven"" which I've owned for over 10 years) when played side by side for comparison - no joke. The fact that Universal doesn't even seem to know that ""the Black Cat"" is such an amazing film irks me no end. Even the brief, generic capsules about each film inside the box refer to ""The Raven"" as a ""horror masterpiece"" while ""Black Cat"" is referred to as a ""shocking horror classic."" The Raven is a fun film but it is SO far from a masterpiece, as anyone who has seen it can tell you, while ""The Black Cat"" is one of the greatest horror films ever made. I haven't even had the heart to check out the other discs (all films I know well). The fact that the best film by far on the disc has been given such assembly line, shoddy treatment is unforgiveable.  Universal should be ashamed of themselves, and as punishment should be banished to their vaults do immaculate digital transfers of all their early classic horror films.

2332584,4,B0009X770E,"THE BELA LUGOSI COLLECTION, from Universal Studios Home Entertainment, is the first Universal DVD I have bought in a while that was a dual density single disk with no technical problems.  After having to return two different copies of ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS to Amazon.com because of technical glitches from two-sided printing, this technically flawless disk is a most welcome addition to the home of anyone who loves Mr. Lugosi.  But I am still knocking it down one star because of laziness on the part of Universal in not having Sara Karloff or Bela Lugosi, Jr. chatting about their fathers.  Or not having any real bonus material.  Boris Karloff stars in three of these five movies, including one that has Lugosi in only a small role.  Visual and sound quality are outstanding on all five Universal releases.

MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE (1932) has Lugosi as Dr. Mirakle, who uses an ape to kidnap young women in 19th Century Paris in order to do blood experiments.  Who will be the bride of Erik the ape?  This sounds ludicrous, but brilliant German Expressionism set design, sincere performances by the future Leon Ames and lovely Sidney Fox (a woman), and a dead serious and scary performance by Lugosi make RUE MORGUE a solid horror classic.

THE BLACK CAT (1934) has a DRACULA reunion between Lugosi and David Manners, along with the monumental starring teaming of Lugosi and Boris Karloff.  Karloff is an architect who has built an Art Moderne mansion on the ruins of a World War One prison camp that he was commandant of.  He is our villain, having held Lugosi (as a famed psychiatrist good guy) hostage and stolen his wife Karin fifteen years in the past.  Manners and young wife Jacqueline Wells and Lugosi are all involved in an accident and forced to stay in  Karloff's sinister house, where devil worship is practiced in a stone basement.  This Edgar G. Ulmer production is a ""B"" movie knockout, the finest movie on this disk.

THE RAVEN (1935) also stars Lugosi and Karloff.  This time Lugosi is the bad guy surgeon who loves Poe torture devices and Karloff is a semi-good guy escaped convict who gets botched plastic surgery f rom Lugosi.  Samuel S. Hinds' daughter is in a bad auto wreck and has her life saved by Lugosi, who wants the daughter for his girl friend.  When Hinds refuses to allow that, Lugosi kidnaps Hinds and puts him on a torture rack.  The rest of the cast seems to be staying at his house on a rainy night and finds their way down to his hidden torture rooms.  This is a solid *** horror film with a lot of chills and only 61 minutes.  Again, the authority in Lugosi's and Karloff's performances makes it work.

THE INVISIBLE RAY (1936) also stars Karloff and Lugosi.  It plays like a Republic horror serial that starts in Transylvania, goes to South Africa, and ends up in Paris.  Karloff invents a radium ray that kills people-or makes them invisible, I'm not sure which.  Karloff somehow gets a Nobel Prize for the invention.  But Lugosi takes credit for it and dies when Karloff meets up with him and confronts him.  This is a passable horror adventure, again made watchable by the presence of the two horror film giants.

Finally, we have BLACK FRIDAY (1940), which reworks a much-better Edward G. Robinson crime drama called TWO SECONDS (1932).  Ready to go to the electric chair, Karloff gives notes on his life and scientific work to a reporter; his life is unfolded in flashback to show how he got to Sing-Sing.  This is a starring crime drama programmer vehicle for Karloff, with Lugosi in a small role as a criminal mastermind.  It is a confused affair for me, and I was never sure just what Karloff did as a scientist to justify a death penalty end.  People die, then come back to life.  Characters are mentioned who are not listed on the beginning and ending cast list.  This, again, plays like a 70 minute Universal horror serial.

As a showcase for Bela Lugosi, four of these five films qualify superbly.  BLACK FRIDAY should have been taken out and replaced with WHITE ZOMBIE (1933), but I am not sure whether WHITE ZOMBIE is a Universal release.  The transfers are superb, with excellent sound and picture for a change.  Again, I am knocking the set down one star because it has no bonuses when bonuses (like son and daughter reminiscences) would have helped a lot.  Too bad it's from cost-cutting Universal and not Warner Home Video.  But someone who wants to know what Bela Lugosi was like could do far worse than this set.",1131408000,9,4480,4.6645408163265305

All of the genre Bela Lugosi classics are here in this set. All except MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE feature his own rival - Boris Karloff on screen as well!

MURDERS IN THE RUE MORGUE (1932) Dr. Mirakle (Lugosi) poses as a perverted Darwinian who cross breeds apes and humans. For this requires test subjects, one of which is a Cesare-like gorilla to carry girls from rooftops on his behalf. Aided by another servant, he carries out his experiments in his own private laboratory. Also stars Sidney Fox, Leon Waycoff (Ames), Arlene Francis, and Noble Johnson.

THE BLACK CAT (1934) Newlyweds David Manners and Julie Bishop are en route to Vienna, when their train compartment is shared by Bela Lugosi as a Hungarian psychiatrist. After an accident on the road during a thunderstorm they are forced to stay the night in a spooky old castle owned by Boris Karloff, who is as we are soon to discover a follower of the Devil, and an old enemy of Lugosi's during the war. Also stars Egon Brecher, Harry Cording, and Albert Conti.

THE RAVEN (1935) When a noble Judge's dancing daughter is wounded in a traffic accident, he seeks the help of Bela Lugosi as a plastic surgeon to save her life. The operation is successful, although Lugosi seems to want something in return. Boris Karloff plays an escaped criminal running from the law who also seeks Lugosi's aide. Lugosi performs surgery on Karloff, disfiguring him as his servant to do his evil bidding when he invites the girl, her father, and other guests to his mansion. Also stars Samuel S. Hinds, Irene Ware, Lester Matthews, and Ian Wolfe.

THE INVISIBLE RAY (1936) Scientist Boris Karloff is obsessed with finding the Nebula Ray of Andromeda to discover it's secret powers of solar energy. He adjourns to Africa with an expedition crew along with a benevolent doctor (Bela Lugosi), his wife, and others. The discovery is a success, however it exposes Karloff to the gamma rays. At intervals his body glows and his touch is fatal. When his fellow scientists abandon his research claiming his discovery for their own, he seeks blood revenge on them all. Also stars Frances Drake, Walter Kingsford, Beulah Bondi, and Frank Lawton.

BLACK FRIDAY (1940) Boris Karloff is convicted to the electric chair. When the story progresses to the past, his friend Professor Kingsley (Stanley Ridges) is fatally wounded from an automobile accident during a gangster raid. The other victim is the escaped criminal. Before the criminal dies he pleads Karloff to save him, with the promise of half a fortune he has hidden somewhere - which is the reason the gangster enemies (lead by Bela Lugosi) were after him. Karloff agrees, although illegally places the brain of the criminal inside the head of his wounded friend. After recovery, Karloff and Ridges adjourn to New York. Soon, Ridges undergoes mental relapses as the escaped killer and seeks revenge on the gangsters who were responsible for his death. Also stars Anne Gwynne, Anne Nagel, Edmund Macdonald, Jack Mulhall, Paul Fix, and Raymond Bailey.

2332592,4,B0009X770E,"Once again, I've made it through a Universal collection unscathed. I've got all of the Monster Legacy Collection sets, including the initial box set with the busts, and now the Bela Lugosi collection, and so far I've gotten a good set of disks the first time every time. Then again, my car and my computer keep taking turns breaking down on me, so maybe this is just the universe's way of balancing things out. Or maybe I'm just really, really lucky.

  I can attest to the fact that The Black Cat and The Raven, at least, look slightly better than on TCM, simply because tv always looks a little fuzzy compared to dvd. Unfortunately all of the scratches and flecks TCM viewers are accustomed to seeing are still there.

  I must add that reading reviews in advance of viewing a movie for the first time can influence one's enjoyment of it. I was slightly disappointed in Murders In The Rue Morgue, after years of hype; though I was pleasantly surprised to find that there is actually some of Poe's story in this one, unlike the other two Poe titled films in this collection, with which I was already very familiar. On the other hand, a number of negative reviews for The Invisible Ray and Black Friday resulted in my being impressed with them upon viewing.

  Anyway, all I need now is The Body Snatcher(part of the upcoming Val Lewton Horror Collection) and I will have six of the eight films that Lugosi and Karloff appeared in together on dvd, the final two being Gift Of Gab and You'll Find Out, neither likely to see dvd release. In the meantime I must finish inspecting my copy of The Hammer Horror Series. I'm already halfway through, and no signs of any problems yet. It's just too bad we have to rush through these films looking for faulty disks, instead of enjoying them at our leisure.",1127779200,12,1797,4.538699690402477
2332593,3,B0009X770E,"First of all, I will say right now I am a fan of Universal's classic horror product including their B-movies of the 40s as well as a lifelong Lugosi fan. I am also very happy Universal chose to release this collection containing some of their best titles of the 30s (""The Black Cat"" and ""The Raven"" being the best on this set) and some of Bela Lugosi's best work on film. Unfortunately, I have mixed feelings about this set. Let me go over the collection:

THE FILMS THEMSELVES:

Not a hint of restoration on any of the films. This to me is a huge disappointment. As far as I know Universal made no claims of restoration so they have not falsely advertised or anything. I guess I am just so spoiled by Warner's classic releases which always seem to be restored and remastered.

The prints don't look horrendous or anything but they could have looked spectacular. The prints they used to make this collection are probably what they show in syndication (like you'd be likely to see on TCM). There is a lot of graininess in all of the films. ""The Raven"" even has some blotchiness (like dirt on the print) in some early scenes. You can also see lots of scratches all over the place.

If MGM can take a film like ""The Ghoul"" that was once considered lost and make it look brand new then Universal could have invested some cash in restoring these classic horror films. They did a much better job with their Monster Legacy Collections. I am surprised they put no effort into this set. These are some of the most famous films they ever made!

P.S.: I strongly advise old-time horror fans to buy ""The Ghoul"". Great film, great restoration.

THE EXTRAS:

All I can say to describe the extras in this collection is threadbare. All you get are some battered old trailers. They don't even have a trailer for every film! Glaringly omitted is the famous trailer for ""The Black Cat"". This is the one that had specially shot footage of Karloff and Lugosi in which they refer to each other as ""Dracula"" and ""Frankenstein"". I have seen this trailer on AMC and TCM, it could have easily been included.

Worst of all there is no featurette. Couldn't they have included even a little 10 or 15 minute feature to honor Lugosi?

PACKAGING:

I actually like the packaging here. There is a nice outer cardboard box that an inner cardboard holder fits into (similar to Warner's ""Citizen Kane"", ""Casablanca"", and ""Adventures of Robin Hood"" releases). In typical Universal style there is only one double-sided disk. I have read a lot of complaints on Amazon about shoddy disks from Universal. I have never encountered one yet (knock on wood) and this disk played well for me.

BOTTOM LINE:

If you have been wanting these films since you got a DVD player, like me, then I would suggest getting this set ASAP. You can't lose considering the price. If you want these films restored and looking their best then wait until the day Universal offers up new releases of restored and remastered prints of them. Who knows when that day will come?

I would give the films on this set 5 stars but can only give this specific release 3 stars.",1127088000,74,3100,4.553956834532374
2332594,5,B0009X770E,"Although five films are crammed onto one disc (again), the prints of these old films are watchable and, in some cases, good. My five stars are for the first three, ""Murders in the Rue Morgue"", ""The Black Cat"" and ""The Raven"". These are classics and in pretty good shape. The last two, ""The Invisible Ray"" and ""Black Friday"" didn't fair as well print wise. However, ""Ray"" looks better than ""Friday"".  But just to have the first three on DVD is worth the buy. ""Murders"" (1932) is still a grisly rendering of the Poe tale with Lugosi in top form as the mad Dr. Mirakle experimenting with gorilla blood in (female) humans. ""Cat"" and ""Raven"" have the wonderful teamings of Lugosi and Karloff pitted against each other in gruesome plots of Poe inspired revenge. All three of these films feature some great sets to marvel over too. For collectors of classic horror films, this is a great set. For Karloff and Lugosi fans, it's a must.

2332595,4,B0009X770E,"Ive been waiting for these (especially the Black Cat) for a long time. The price is right folks. These are the black and white classics that inspired it all.

2332597,4,B0009X770E,"As noted in another review, this collection contains two films, Invisible Ray and Black Friday, which really showcase Karloff more than Lugosi, but this is still a terrific collection for any Lugosi fan. He shines in Murders in the Rue Morgue, Black Cat and The Raven. The films have been nicely cleaned up for the DVD release and look good considering their age. The sound is decent as well. The set would have earned 5 stars but is lacking any special features other than trailers for a few of the films. Still, for the price, it's a great deal.",1126224000,4,547,4.5353535353535355
2332598,5,B0009X770E,"It's rather interesting that this set is called the Bela Lugosi Collection when Boris Karloff also stars in all of these films except for Murders in the Rue Morgue and is the feature star in Black Friday & The Invisible Ray.  Still, one cannot diminish the importance of this set as none of these films was available on DVD until now.

Murders in the Rue Morgue is a film dominated by Lugosi, perhaps more than any other role.  He's the center of attention and gets a lof of screen time in the role of Crazy Dr. Mirakle who injects women with the blood of a gorilla named Erik.  It's a deeply atmostpheric film thanks to cinematographer Karl Freund who also worked on Dracula.

The Black Cat is the masterpiece of this collection.  Considering it was the early 1930's, this was one twisted film with elements of satanic worship, torture, and incest.  Lugosi is Dr. Werdegast who journeys to the strange home of Hjalmar Poelzig (Karloff) which was formerly a fortress and built over the scene of a grisly WWI battlefield.  Lugosi is seeking revenge on Poelzig for taking his wife and daughter while he was imprisoned for years.  Werdegast soon learns his wife married Poelzig but is now dead and kept suspended in a glass coffin while Poelzig then married his daughter.  On top of that, Poelzig is the leader of a Satanic cult.  These were rather bold concepts for the time.  Lugosi and Karloff are both great in the film but Lugosi gets the better of Boris on this occasion.

The Raven is another loosely based Poe film as Lugosi plays the brilliant Dr. Vollin who saves the life of a Judge's daughter but then becomes obsessed with the girl (Irene Ware).  Vollin forces the small-time criminal Bateman (Karloff) to do his bidding by disfiguring him with the promise of repairing the damage later.  Vollin plans to kidnap the judge and his daughter and torture them in the chamber he's built in his mansion.  Bela was at his over the top best as Vollin and Karloff's disfigured face was once again the work of makeup wiz Jack Pierce.

It's a great treat to have these films finally available on DVD!",1125532800,5,2099,4.61455525606469
