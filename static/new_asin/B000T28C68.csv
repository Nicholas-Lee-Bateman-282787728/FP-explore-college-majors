2892805,4,B000T28C68,This DVD has 9 cases plus extras. You get to see the episodes without the commercial breaks and the closing statements are different. Judge Judy says a little something before each episode. I am a huge fan and these 9 cases are not really the ones I would pick. The only exception is the lawyer/paralegal case which is one of my favorites. Not sure why the other cases were selected. The quality of the DVD is much better then watching the original episodes. The extras are nice too. This is a good start of what I hope is a regular DVD release. Why not have each season released in a box set?,1189814400,22,593,4.303571428571429
2892806,3,B000T28C68,"I'm an avid Judge Judy fan and was thrilled when I leared of this DVD.  I was expecting the cases where the litigants caused a scene, were caught in out and out lies and generally outrageous.  The cases on this DVD were not any of those.  I was a bit bored and disappointed.
I enjoyed the 60 minutes interviews and definitely enjoyed listening to the cases in the background while I puttered around the house, but was hoping for more.",1189814400,14,434,4.4
2892807,5,B000T28C68,These aren't all her best shows (as others have pointed out) but worth owning if you're a true Judge Judy fan.  The Judge navigates adroitly between humor and frankness; dispensing jurisprudence in an entertaining but always dignified fashion.  Her knowledge covers a wide stance of law.  I wholeheartedly recommend the show and plead nolo contendere to being a big fan.,1189555200,6,370,5.133333333333334
2892808,5,B000T28C68,"Not only is Judge Judy deliberate on the bench (anyone who has seen her show would be totally dumb to have their case heard by her and aired to 10 million people in my opinion), she is delightful out of her robes.  I have seen her on talk shows and she is totally different than when doing her job.  I was so glad that this DVD came out and look forward to many, many more.  I  tape her every day and watch it at night along with the evening dose of Judge Judy and then love it that we here in the Bay Area get her back to back on Sundays as well for double doses.  I don't know how she gets away with saying what she says sometimes, but sometimes, the truth hurts.  Just stay clean and away from her court room (ha).",1189555200,,717,3.9444444444444446

2892810,3,B000T28C68,"I love watching ""Judge Judy"" and I have been waiting for a DVD for some time, unforunately, this is a disappointment.  For one thing, I don't agree that these selections are the most interesting or outrageous cases Judge Judy has had.  They would have been much better off issuing the original season, then just nine cases out all the years that ""Judge Judy"" has aired.

I give five stars to Judge Judge herself, but this DVD leaves a lot to be desired.  People with a passing interest in the show may enjoy it, but it's not enough for fans.",1189468800,60,541,4.434343434343434

she has several key phrases that are hilarious. my favorite is 'shut up in my courtroom'. also, i love how the plaintiffs, defendants, and witnesses all eventually get that scared deer in the headlights look and start to look at the floor until judy bangs on her desk and says 'don't look down there, or over there, or up there. look RIGHT HERE!' as she points to her own eyes,and her voice begins to raise. it usually goes downhill from there. i can't wait to see this dvd!!!",1189382400,6,683,4.428571428571429

2892854,1,B000T28C68,"I was on the show. When we contacted the show we were suing for money borrowed with a promissory note, stolen money, fees charged and emotional distress.
The person screening the info said we couldn't include everything which made no sense. She told us what we could and couldn't include then after we faxed her all the evidence she came up with some arbitrary figure and wouldn't listen to us as our figures were much different than what she added up. She then said she will include our filing fees and the money borrowed as emotional distress which I explained I didn't want because emotional distress is hard to get and is a judgement call not a factual call. We were set up to lose the amount that was listed in our suit. We received 40% of outmr suit.
We were given legal advise on what to say and how to present our case which was much different than a normal case would be argued plus there's a time frame the case is allowed we weren't given a chance to present even half of our case and presented it the way we were instructed to do. I am not site but is it legal for people on the show to give legal advise on the case presentation when there nit an attorney?
Based on the paperwork they make everyone sign we are not allowed to appeal or really sue which is wrong because we never presented our emotional distress part of the suit so as far as I am concerned the money borrowed along with emotional distress, distruction of property is still open for usvto sue since we didn't have the chance to present that part of our law suit. The Judge picks either the defendant or plaintiff and then is bias towards everything said lie or no lie then your not given the chance to rebut the lies given which the judge uses in his decision. Trust me if you go on a court show don't listen to their lame legal advice use your own common sense you will come out ahead instead of being treated poorly and ignored and made to look stupid.",1379808000,,1933,4.298630136986302

2892861,5,B000T28C68,"Judge Judy is the greatest!  Period! She has taken court TV to its highest level. Having been a judge for twenty years myself, I can say without reservation that Judge Judy's instincts are without equal.  She knows when someone is trying to give her a snow job, and she does not hesitate to let that person know that he or she is lying.  The difference between Judge Judy and the rest of us is that she says outright what we are merely thinking.  The only thing about Judge Judy that isn't good is that there are only two Judge Judy DVDs for sale.  Perhaps Judge Judy should issue a court order directing the powers that be to make more DVDs.",1347408000,,642,4.316666666666666
2892862,3,B000T28C68,"I love Judge Judy but it's as if the producers of this compilation purposely weeded out the most bland, forgettable cases over ten years. Through the show's long run, I can remember episodes in which a woman ripped off her wig revealing a bald head and one where a transvestite burst into tears and was passed a tissue box by Byrd (not the same case), one where a witness appeared half naked, another that featured a defendant so irritating Judge Judy announced he had plead guilty to rape in an unrelated case. There was even one episode that featured Bea Arthur, for God's sake. You'll find none of that here. Too many car crash cases, too many unremarkable witnesses, not that they're on screen long enough for that to become a problem (each case has been heavily edited from the original broadcast) - the most interesting case involved the room-mate fight over two tupperware containers, and only because it was so hilariously ludicrous. Also, the screen format has been modified to fit the wide screen, stretching the vision to the point where even Judge Judy looks obese and the quality of the film is also quite poor; if it wasn't a DVD, I would have thought my aerial was playing up. As for the bonus features, they are all available on YouTube.",1328140800,,1253,4.648648648648648
2892863,5,B000T28C68,"For her age, Judge Judy rocks.  She has a terrific memory and quick sense of humor.  What makes her outstanding (compared to other t.v judges) is she is ALWAYS is control of courtroom.  NOTHING passes by her.  When ligiates try to change the subject, or move in a direction other than where Judy is going she knocks 'em down.  I've met a number of people who think Judy's style is way out place for a woman in her position, but I think she has good morales and common sense that outweigh an aggressive style.  These dvds are a must for any collector.",1327968000,,550,4.3431372549019605

2892870,3,B000T28C68,"Judge Judy Justice Served is a collection of Judge Judy cases. It's a very mixed bunch. It starts out with a case involving a fight over Tupperware. The plaintiff is hilariously dramatic and I can watch this one over and over. Other highlights are the silly platinum blonde who complained to the LAPD after getting a speeding ticket  (""You're a big baby"", Judy tells her) and the drunken man who backed into a couple's car then tripped and fell in their garden. Less entertaining is the very long case of the Yorba Linda teens who sued a limo company who were late on their prom night. The DVD ends with an unusually serious case about a woman who's suing the mother of a girl who died in a car accident, for damages to her car.

So the collection is a mixed bunch. Some of them are hilarious, others are not. Entertaining for the most part, but could have been better.

On to the extra features. There are some promotional pieces for her show, not very interesting. A short segment from when she got her star on the Walk of Fame, and a very interesting 1993 story on Family court judge Judith Sheindlin. It shows her as a family court judge in court and in interviews. I found it very interesting to see how she was as a judge before she was on TV. This is followed by a ""ten years later"" story on her, now the famous ""Judge Judy"".

3 stars for the mixed quality of the cases. I could almost, but not quite, consider giving it an extra star for the 60 minutes shows.",1228435200,,1467,4.323636363636363

Well, the DVD is disappointing.  It only has 9 cases, none of which are particularly long or much more interesting than the show itself.  It has a couple 60 minutes interviews that are cool, just because it was neat to see Judge Judy in her former ""life"" so-to-speak and with her family.  But, all said and done, this DVD isn't even worth the $12 asking price.

If I buy a DVD of a show like this, I expect to at least be given more than an hours worth of cases and some slapped-together ""extra"" content.  I would not recommend purchasing this DVD as you are better off just watching the show.",1212883200,2,757,4.326241134751773

2892880,5,B000T28C68,"I am a fan of Judge Judy.  I like her no nonsense approach to life and the legal system.  Having myself grown up in a family of police and police chiefs, I know full well the crap that goes on in life as well as the legal system.  Having just gone through a legal fiasco of being accused of something I didn't and wouldn't do, I prayed to have a judge like Judge Judy preside over the case.  This drug out for 2 years while the other person smeared my name in every media outlet she could think of - even the FBI - and every place where I was scheduled to give talks about my book.  I finally had to sue her to shut her up and then she hid like a scared @*&%$! Well after dragging this out by not providing us with their evidence and discovery - which I am sure she didn't have, they decided to settle out of court with a public retraction and an apology as to what she had said about me.  So I never got my day in court, but oh I wish I had just to hear Judge Judy tell her ""you can't fix stupid and dumb is forever!""  I recommend her books, they are funny, comical and down to earth legal approches to life in the court system.  You will get a whole new perspective on the way things are done and they might get you fired up to get a wrong you have been dealt righted.  Read Them!!",1208563200,,1283,3.922779922779923

Hopefully, this one was to ""test the waters,"" and there will be enough sales to release more (ALL) shows on DVD...so great to be able to watch them for someone who can't see them daily, and for those fans who would love a Judge-Judy-thon...episode after episode with no commercials.

2892905,4,B000T28C68,"In a world full of people doing stupid things it's nice to have someone like Judge Judy to call out the idiots and tell it like it is. I have watched her for years and she always brings a smile to my face. So, of course, I was looking forward to watching her first DVD release.

Actually, I wish they would have put out a ""Season One"" DVD and then proceeded in chronological order. But instead this is a ""best of"" collection of 9 cases compiled from various seasons. For me the last two cases were the most interesting. The 8th case involved an alcoholic hillbilly trying to claim he wasn't driving drunk when he smashed into another family's vehicle. The best part was the hilarious video tape which showed the boozed up fool tripping and falling to the ground. The final case wasn't so much funny as pathetically sad. It shows a woman suing her neighbor over a wrecked truck. But it was the woman's own irresponsible actions, giving the keys to her 14 yeard old son, that allowed the neighbor's 14 year old daughter to die in the accident. This woman has to be one of the most selfish, cold hearted individuals I have ever seen. Fortunately, Judge Judy let her have it exactly as she deserved. Another case involving a very hotheaded Colorado hunter is also worth watching. The guy might have actually been in the right. But he behaved like such a clown that Judge Judy clearly wasn't going to give him the benefit of the doubt.

This DVD also includes several ""extras"" such as Judge Judy's two 60 Minutes interviews and a scene showing her receiving her star on the Hollywood ""Walk Of Fame"". As I said earlier, I would have preferred a ""Season One"" DVD. But this is worth at least a rental for those who love Judge Judy, her inimitable style, clever remarks and passion for the truth.",1197936000,,1787,4.495384615384616

2892908,3,B000T28C68,"I enjoy watching Judge Judy and TiVo it regularly as the ""guilty pleasure"" I allow myself from time to time. There aren't many episodes I haven't seen, except for the early years, but I had seen all nine on this DVD. Only two episodes, and possibly a third were, in my opinion, deserving of a ""best"" collection. Having seen the show more times than I should admit, there were much better episodes than at least six of the episodes chosen.

This DVD also contains the two specials that 60 Minutes did on her. The first was before she became ""Judge Judy"", and likely is what got her the job. It showcased a tough as nails family court judge who brooked no ""nonsense"" and was firmly in control of her court room at all times. The second was well after she had become Judge Judy, and showed us a bit of what fame had given her (a few homes, a few ""extra parts"", as she said, and it looks like her husband, the judge on People's Court for two years) had a bit of work done too. If you ever saw him on People's Court - I saw him a couple of times - he was funny. To one lady he once said, ""You have a hot temper. And I know something about hot tempers."" Obviously referring to his wife, this drew great laughs from the audience.

There's a segment on her ""isms"", and, well, it's not terribly entertaining, unless you haven't seen her show that often and want to see what makes her unique, or you really, really enjoy her and can't get enough of her. For even the casual fan, it's only mildly interesting to watch.

What frustrated me personally was that the DVD was neither captioned nor subtitled. It stuns me that as 2007 comes to a close, DVDs are still being released without captions or subtitles. Do they not want deaf or hearing impaired people to buy the DVD? It's not terribly expensive to have something captioned, and her TV shows are all captioned, so the exclusion on the DVD was disappointing. Being hearing impaired, I guess it was a good thing that I had seen all of the episodes before. But, that's why I have these:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/TV-Ears/dp/B0002GMDQG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">TV Ears</a>. They work marvelously.

Aside from hearing impaired people, there were no Spanish subtitles either, so I guess they weren't interested in the Spanish-speaking population - a large one - buying this either.

Her technique is flawless, but her judgment is a little off.  At one point she throws a pen cap at Deputy Bert and calls him a fagel.  I thought that was a little uncalled for, but, in Judge Judy's court, anyting can fly, so to speak.  The last case inovles a hot 19 year old and her even finer 20 year old boyfriend.  Judge Judy pummels the girl for wearing a shirt that exposes her ""mid driff.""  That was quite comical and, a case to put in the spank bank nonetheless.  I still got wood.  The special features on the dvd include the following:  (1) Judge Judy sparking up a lucky strike and bossing staff around at break, (2) Judge Judy clubbing her first baby seal circa 1978 and  (3) Judge Judy receiving a set of steak knives in recognition of 100 consecutive cases where she uses the phrase, ""I will always be smarter than you.""

Before watching, I was a bit apprehensive because the reviews were not very positive.  However, I was pleasantly surprised.

Despite their being only 9 cases, they show Judy at her best.  The extras were also great.  I particularly liked the 2 60 minutes interviews showing the judge then and now.  It was cool to see Judy pre-TV stardom.

The Judyisms compilation was also quite comical.

The ONLY complaint I have about this DVD is that I wish there were more...more cases, extras, etc.  Specifically, I wish they would have done interviews with supporting cast members like Byrd and announcer Jerry Bishop.

I hope the release of this DVD will compel the studio to release more Judge Judy compilations.  I will certainly be one of the first to add future Judy DVDs to my collection!

In closing, I would say this.  If the purpose of this DVD was to leave viewers wanting more, the studio more than succeeded!!!!",1191024000,9,1074,4.6436170212765955
2892929,4,B000T28C68,"I absolutely love Judge Judy.  I still remember watching the ""60 Minutes"" Episode from over 13 years ago and thinking what an interesting person she was (by the way, that interview - as well as the 1993 interview - is included in the DVD).

There are a total of 9 episodes, including one of my favorites - an Asian lady who had sued the LAPD officer who had given her a ticket.  Her father was a retired LAPD officer and it seemed apparent she had tried to use her father's name in order to influence the cop not give her the ticket.  Judge Judy made mincemeat out of her and her father.

The extras are of Judge Judy receiving a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, some promos for the show, both ""60 Minutes"" interviews and clips of ""Judyisms"".

I wish a ""Season 1"" DVD set had been available instead.  Or even a multi-DVD set.  Also, it would have been nice to have had an interview with bailiff Petri Hawkins Byrd - or even some clips of him ""talking"" with unruly defendants.

The two interviews were AWESOME to see her back the in real court and now.
The interview when she gets a star on the sidewalk was also excellent.
The pomos?  Eh. I didn't like them.  Boring.

What it was missing was, the first few cases.  Why didn't they show us a pilot or demo or something.  Or some of the old episodes where she had mean eyebrows, and a slightly different courtroom.  That would have been cool to see.  Or behind the scenes look at how they make the show.
Lastly WHERE'S BYRD.  Officer Petri-Hawkins Byrd wasn't even mentioned.

Many seem to find the show's biggest attraction in how Judge Scheindlin humiliates the litigants, so the choice of cases and participants is critical in determining how entertaining the show will be.  I find the litigants' psychoses and desperate self-justification even funnier than Judy's acerbic comments.  Unfortunately, I could easily remember quite a few cases more interesting than those on this DVD.  The only really great one here is the young woman who, failing to get out of a speeding ticket, wrote a complaint against the LAPD officer who stopped her.  You can really get a more enjoyable serving of Judge Judy on YouTube, although with the release of this DVD, perhaps the show's producers will soon have those on YouTube removed.  I'm hoping that this is a mere trial to see whether there's enough of a market to produce more JJ collections on DVD.

""CONFRONTATION ENTERTAINMENT"" gets the 'big' ratings! Look at what ""Jerry Springer"" got started years ago, & is 'still' on the air today. People have taken much delight in viewing his 'guests' go at it, arguing, yelling, screaming & even out right 'physical' violence! His guests just LOVE it! Many Talk Shows have followed his success & incorporated many of the same elements into their shows. JUDY has more control over the audience on her show, that's for sure. In fact, she has ""all"" the control, many times not even allowing those before her to explain their side of the case.  She cuts people off, asks questions & then doesn't let them finish giving the answer. She delights in her ""abilities"" to bully people & as she says, ""to make them look bad."" Funny, we has so many ADS on t.v. ""against"" Bullying now, but some gets 'overlooked' for some reason. One of her much repeated lines is: ""I'M SMART! I'M SMARTER THAN YOU! ON MY WORSE DAY I'M SMARTER THAN YOU!"" Yes, & apparently so 'very' modest too!  And she loves to Confront people that are on ""Disability"" for some reason. ""WHY AREN'T YOU WORKING?"" she barks as she looks at them with disgust! ""YOU WERE ABLE TO WALK IN HERE & YOU'RE STANDING ON TWO LEGS,
