8324556,5,6301866517,"This is a music video. It does not take sides, but tells the story of several Civil War battles through song. As the songs are sung, the reenacted battle is shown. As far as I can tell, it follows history correctly. It only lasts about 25 minutes. I especially liked the song dedicated to the flag bearers during battle. The time line may not be correct, I do not know since it opens with the Battle of Gettysburg. The songs are well done and they cast no opinion as to right or wrong. I enjoyed it very much.",1396310400,,509,4.204081632653061
