8249242,1,B00134YQN4,"I'm disappointed. Well I did not see the Route 66 series when it was on tv, then when this was available I looked forward to seeing some of the old road (or good fascmiles of same) and a good road story with it. These are three 'one hour movies' that are actually 50 minutes each with their original commercials. Unless I missed it the only view of Route 66 or any highway is in the cigarette commercials. Well I can say of these three episodes the last one with Lorre, Karloff and Chaney is the best. If you want to cruise the highway look elsewhere.",1312416000,,551,4.257142857142857
8249243,5,B00134YQN4,"This DVD attracted me for one reason and it is absolutely essential for fans of vintage horror movies. One of the 3 episodes contained on ths disc features guest appearances by Boris Karloff, Lon Chaney Jr and Peter Lorre. They all deliver first class performances as you'd expect from these masters of the macabre, but of particular interest is that Karloff and Chaney revisit their most famous roles for one final time, Frankenstein's monster and the Wolf Man respectively. Absolutely priceless!",1224806400,,497,5.148148148148148
8249244,4,B00134YQN4,"Although only 3 episodes are included, at least for the first time they have all been transferred from high quality masters with proper framing and even including many original commercials. Too bad they didn't do this with the season sets.",1209081600,4,239,5.0
8249245,5,B00134YQN4,"Just as I remembered. Two guys cruising the Mother of all Roads, helping people and driving off into the sunset. Neat to see all the stars appearing in the episodes. The acting was adequate to very good with the car being an important supporting cast member. I heard that the two stars did not get along in real life, but that was not evident on the tiny screen. If you have ever dreamed that you would ""motor west"" and take the ""highway that's the best"" you will get that feeling again with this DVD. There is nothing like going though Kingman in a '62 Fuelie!",1208995200,,561,4.352380952380952
8249246,4,B00134YQN4,"There were 2 DVD discs and there is one.  The one disc repeat is alot of season
one and only one episode is from another season.  Hopefully, season 1 volume
2 will be rereleased in the original format.",1207958400,,201,4.2631578947368425
