4911821,5,B00602MSFW,"i haven't watched this one yet :),  it looks very good.  this guy is incredible.  he builds his own technology with a tornado car like thing, to protect him and the other people from dangerous tornados, that develops in texas, and kansas ;).  if everyone cold have those tornado protector cars, to protect 100s of people in tornado alleys :).  i just started watching the first season of storm chasers, and it's getting more interesting with this guy, and his employees.  i recommend these series to anyone that loves tornado chasing as a hobby ;).  everyone will love these series, and they will see how dangerous these tornado quests are :0.  I've always loved watching tornado movies, and there fun to watch, and studying about them to.  it's great science to learn about with tornados ;).  i feel bad about those people when there industries got wrecked bi the huge tornado :(.  enjoy watching these great series about these dangerous tornado quests ;).",1384646400,,957,4.809815950920245
4911822,4,B00602MSFW,"I ordered this dvd to find out more about Tim Samaras, the storm chaser who was recently killed to find out more about him, and got into the drama of watching Samaras and Sean Casey and others chase tornadoes including a very dramatic ending that involved one storm chaser having his car window destroyed by a tornado.  I'm not going to reveal who this storm chaser was so I won't spoil the excitement or drama for someone else but it punctuated a very dramatic tornado season captured by this dvd.  It also pointed out the tragedy of Samaras' death because he seemed like a very conscientious storm chaser who was concerned about saving lives from tornadoes.  It's a tragedy his life was ended trying to save lives but it also appears very noble as well.",1373673600,2,755,4.5777777777777775

8490112,1,B00602MSFW,"The producer needlessly switched camera footage so rapidlyand often that I could not enjoy the beauty of a building storm, nor the numerous splendid funnels that were revealed only briefly. I actually could not watch the entire storyline due to induced motion sickness.  Also the video is more about people interaction than about storms.  Only purchase this video if you are already afflicted with AHDD.",1393977600,,403,5.184615384615385
8490113,3,B00602MSFW,"This was an more an interesting inner look at the Chasers and their interactions with each other than it was about the storms they were chasing and I must admit, little has changed since the days of JP Finley. There was more storms and changeable weather amidst some of the Chasers than there was in the Oklahoma skies. The biggest problems seemed to be between Sean Casey and Josh Wurman who seemed to view Casey with disdain toward his goals, viewing him as more of an interloper than a fellow chaser. I will admit the TIV and the TIV2 have become Iconic and the landscape would certainly be the poorer without them. As for Reed Timmer and the Dominator, Casey had his own disdain, poorly hidden for that, believing that his own idea had been usurped by Reed. The only one who was on an even keel was the late Tim Samaras, who had his own approach to the work at hand and was able to steer clear of the obvious ego fest everyone else seemed to indulge in.  While I found it somewhat annoying, I did find it interesting, and a with deeper insight as to some rather volatile personalities out there in the field.",1393027200,2,1112,4.398058252427185
