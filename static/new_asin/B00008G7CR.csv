7983103,5,B00008G7CR,"In the past, I've own this product, I've passed it onto other guitar players, just never came back. I'm assuming converted to a Metallica Fan, actually ex-student runs a Metallica Tribute Band. When friends & students were getting bored practicing and / or playing guitar, something they'd watch appreciate & learn off other guitar player's style, grab was is usefull, or give a try, pick up / improve their skills & techniques. It all depends on the guitar player's seriousness. If your Metallica fan, GREAT. If not, don't diss it, until you see it. Be more Opened Mind Guitar Player. Curt Mitchell is excellent instructor, Kudo to this instructor, but let me reind you, DVD is compress for length of time to play. Enjoy this product. Cause I'm ordering, again. Have fun in life.",1350691200,,780,4.8283582089552235
7983104,1,B00008G7CR,"I bought this video for a friend who is just learning guitar. I thought I should view it before I gave it to him...I'm glad I did. This instructional video (if one could call it that) is very sub par for many reasons. First, the production quality is horible and the audio will drop out occasionally. The instructor can barely put together a cohernt sentence and there are tons of times where he pauses on a thought for a good three seconds. Its as though they recorded this on a one take and on the fly. His explenation of how Metallica achieved their signature sounds is misguided at best as well. He states that they used hot-rodded Marshall half stacks (which is true for Kill'em All) but from Ride The Lightning on they were heavily using Mesa Boogie MKII C+ modded amps. Which they have used for almost every album after Kill' Em and is the staple of thier heavy sound. The biggest gripe I have about this instructional video however, is that he plays many riffs and licks wrong (he completely botches Fade to Black, where almost every riff and lick is played incorrectly)! I have played guitar for over 10 years and have been an avid Metallica learner for years. I learned much from watching concert videos and other material that have been approved by Metallica. From this I have been able to determine that much the riffs and licks that he demonstrates in this video are played incorrectly, despite sounding similar to the actual way they are played. Now that may be ok for some people who just want to learn to sound like Metallica, but for guitar officaionados and anyone serious about emulating the style and playing techinques of Metallica, this is unacceptable. Almost every riff/lick is presented with no explenation of technique or understanding of how to execute the riff/lick properly. This video is best suited for someone who is just starting out at guitar and quickly wants to learn a Metallica riff. However, for those with some basic knowledge of Metallica or guitar officionados this video fails miserably.",1258329600,,2030,4.737288135593221
7983105,5,B00008G7CR,I was 29 years old and I finally bought my first electric guitar. A year later I still sucked and didn't know how to play anything. I bought this Video and for the next month watched each part (about 50 mini riffs in video) over and over again. The video plays the riff normal speed then slow speed and zooms into the hand fret work. It's a little hard to get at first because it looks like the middle finger is doing something but usually it's not. It took me about a dozen times watching each riff before I got it. So after a month and 15 hours watching this AWESOME video I can play a TON OF METALLICA. Do not buy MORE Metallica - the second video. Kirt Mitchell gains 50 pounds and is incoherant. Great example of why not to do drugs.,1095552000,7,738,4.131944444444445
