2064650,1,B000278BNO,Now I love low-budget horror movies but this one just sucks in general all around. The characters are all stupid and not likeable at all and it's also a very boring movie that goes nowhere. The only good part is the end and it's over way to fast. Do not buy this movie. If you can rent it then go for it.,1365552000,,304,3.9193548387096775
2064651,2,B000278BNO,"I picked this movie up for $2.00 at a rental store, the cover looked scary enough, the back of the box read like it was going to be an interestingly scary flick.

It started out with two homeless guys taking shelter in an old run down house, they sneak in through the basement window, and see a pipe with green goo on it. One of the idiots touch the green goo and it ends up going up his arm and spreads on his face and burns his skin off, eventually burning his face away untill you can see his skull...no blood in that entire scene..now if my face was burning..there'd be lot of flesh and blood showing...not in this movie though...

So the movie continues on with dream sequences and alot of hallucinations for the main character...about 45 minutes into the movie is the only remotely interesting scene...which only lasts about 10 seconds...involving a toilet, a guy, and lots of blood squirting all over :-).

The rest of the movie nobody really dies...none of the main characters even get hurt...they lay around performing a seance, while fake looking flying creatures swirl around them...

To sum it all up, there isn't much gore, very few kills, lots of boring scenes that drag out for minutes, too many hallucinations, and the acting isn't all that great...

Last but not least, if you see this movie in a store, and the pictures on the back of the box persuede you to get this, DON'T BUY IT! None of the bloody scenes on the back of the box ever happen in this movie! Don't let the pictures fool you..none of them are in the movie!!!",1157241600,,1542,4.473309608540926
2064652,3,B000278BNO,"This movie definatley gets a B-Tastic award. It's bad, really bad, but definatley fun to watch.

There are so many holes in the plot I can't even believe it. The biggest one is when the kids are sittin on the couch staring at a wall and somehow see the girl getting attacked outside, on the other side of the house. Rather than list them all out I'll let you find them out yourself. The father in this film is hilarious; unintentionally. He is the most over-bearing a-hole I have ever seen in a movie. He never stops harrassing his daughter at every moment he can. One example is when the daughter is having nightmares she keeps tossing and turning in bed. She wakes up. Somehow the dad was not bothered at all by her tossing and turning, but the sitting up thing apparently was too far. She sits up and you hear him yell up ""What the hell is going on up there?""

The film focuses on using stop motion animation and reverse film to make the special effects. The plot is totally linear, leaving no room for suprise. When things get icky this film brings in the cliche' old mand who somehow knows everything about whats going on. I'll leave it at that.

The most amusing thing about this movie has got to be the packaging. The ghoul on the cover IS NOT in the movie at all. The house on the cover is also in no way the house where the film takes place. To top it off, ther are pictures on the back that are also not in the movie. The most notable one is the picture with the girls who has her eyes sucked out. Not only is that not in the move, but that character is also no where to be found in the entire film. The film description on the back has 3 innacuracies on it. First, she never calls her friends they just show up. Second, the father is not gone on business, he goes drinking. I can't quite remember what the third is right now. The package I'm referring to is the one with the blue guy on the front. I've seen this film with different packaging of which I can't speak on.",1119744000,4,1980,4.191601049868766

8023114,2,B000278BNO,Wow horrible! Horrible acting not put together very well. Glad I didn't pay. Waste of time.,1518393600,,91,4.75
8023115,4,B000278BNO,"So fun, cheesy gore scenes, groovy stop motion monsters, funny dialogue, this is up there with Troll 2 or the Room in fun bad movies",1517875200,,132,4.32
8023116,4,B000278BNO,"Grab the nachos and prepare to be flooded with cheese. Everything is terrible - acting, effects, plot, camera work... everything. But it's gleefully terrible in the ""RiffTrax"" kinda way. Plus there is nudity (i know that's what everyone is wondering). If you're in a goofy mood, this is movie is for you. If you're contemplating suicide or getting of the grid, you may want to skip it.",1511913600,,385,4.7611940298507465

8023119,1,B000278BNO,"This movie was all around bad.  Yes, I was expecting a B movie but this was a really bad B movie.  Honestly, I didn't even find it hokey or funny which some of these movie can pull off.  Don't waste your time or money.",1459123200,2,218,3.909090909090909
8023120,5,B000278BNO,"This is pulp horror as an art form; all the right ingredients: immediate story hook, creepy house, hot naked chick in the bath tub, GORE, and cool low budget effects.  In all, a gross, organic blast!",1458518400,2,199,4.527777777777778
8023121,4,B000278BNO,"If you were looking for a cool a B movie for a weekend night, this is the place to go. From the start it moves fast. I guess you could guess from the title it involves a drain. Yes indeed it does, and a giant glob of murdering goo that eats people. It takes place in a old rundown house that a family tries to flip.  The acting is passable, and sometimes funny. I think this is one of director Brett Pipers best works. Ok it is not a high budget film, but it works. Don't expect Star Wars effect in the film, but the effect are pretty decent.  For those who want Star Wars effects avoid this. For those who love B films  and seek out cool ones, this is way cool. The cover is great too on the DVD. Much better than some of the movies on the SY-Fi channel.",1406419200,,755,3.9539473684210527
8023122,2,B000278BNO,"I happened upon this movie because I'm a fan of one of the actors, Alexandra Boylan.  She is awesome in Home Sweet Home and is also in the Indie film Bellflower.  I think she is a superb actress but this movie doesn't do her justice.  It doesn't do any of the actors justice really . . . it is a bad B movie but that is also what makes it great.  Definitely fun to laugh at/with.",1370822400,,379,3.9473684210526314
