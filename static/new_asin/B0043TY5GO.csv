8415297,2,B0043TY5GO,"This BD provides a few images of each of a number of lighthouses in the NW US. Indexing is minimal; there is no way to go directly to the views of a specific lighthouse. Instead, organization is by geographic clusters, generally proceeding northward from near the California - Oregon border, so to view a specific lighthouse one must select its cluster and then fast-forward to the desired lighthouse.

In general the images are boring and there is no information about the structures themselves. It would have been nice if the views of each lighthouse was preceded by a single static page giving the name, location, date of construction, class of lens, and current status with respect to maintenance, operation, etc. That same page could have provided a partial map of that section of coast, placing the lighthouse relative to landmarks and its neighbors. Instead there is just a static page giving the lighthouse name, followed by a sequence of views.

Sound accompaniment is also not very interesting. Since viewers could mute the sound, it would be nice if it conveyed a sense of the locale, such as the crashing waves that are heard on visits to many (but by no means all) of these sites. I've lived on this coast every summer for over two decades and know the area well. The serene views presented on this BD do not convey at all a sense of what it is like to stand and look at these old beauties, which serve as a testiment to the days before GPS, when they saved many a life.",1338768000,,1483,4.613636363636363
8415298,4,B0043TY5GO,"Great picture quality, some nice lighthouse scenes and scenery, but it would have been a little less boring if there'd been some quick inside the lighthouse scenes. Also it would have added to the attraction of this Blu-ray if there'd also been a panoramic sweep of the surrounding areas as seen from the actual lighthouse tower. Watching the animated film at the end, perked things up!",1333065600,,386,4.863636363636363
8415299,5,B0043TY5GO,Very interesting.  I've lived on the coast of Calif. all my life and I love lighthouses.  This item was very well done.  I enjoyed it.,1300060800,,134,4.28
8415300,5,B0043TY5GO,"This blu ray was extremely beautiful and well shot.  The angles, scenic cropping, background with the wonderful music of Johnny Bregar.  These are scenes for any family to sit and watch joyously together.  DISNY IS BACK with the  family enjoyment of this disc.  I will buy another when its available.  Stacy Spears did a wonderful job with this.  These scenes are priceless as too,timeless. I truly recommend this to anyone.",1294099200,,424,4.9714285714285715
8415301,5,B0043TY5GO,"Got home today to find my Blu-Ray dvd in the mail. Popped it in my Panasonic DMP-BDT300 blu-Ray Player attached to my Panasonic Viera TCP50VT 3-D plasma tv, and TALK ABOUT A GREAT PICTURE... The RED Camera (and the cameraman) did a great job on this DVD. Fantastic natural colors, great composition, and musical score. Even has shots of lazy seals sunbathing on the rocks, and an awesome shot of whales. Can't wait for the next project to come out. S & M did a fantastic job on this and anyone that loves Lighthouses, will want this exceptional Blu-Ray disc.",1286150400,4,558,4.59
