8086528,1,B000BGQUGG,"I had high expectations for this movie because it was half-way carried by James Spader who excels in roles that are more conversational and involves human interaction. The artsy feel and uncomfortable theme of the movie just hit me the wrong note with me. I feel Spader's character was inconsistently written. Was he a lucky survivor or a victim? I suppose he was both, but what he perceived himself as was unclear and he went back and forth on this; and also with how his character felt about Anne Brochet's character.  I agree with the other review that Brochet's accent was a little difficult to understand to the point where I did use the captions.  There were several good moments between the two characters , but unfortunately they were overshadowed by the lackluster, drawn out plot and weak ending. I'm a huge, HUGE  Spader fan but this movie is definitely a can-miss!",1231372800,16,876,4.75
8086529,4,B000BGQUGG,"Very few films can hold your attention when it has only 2 chracters for almost the entire film. This film is haunting, worring and sexy all at the same time. The location is fabulous and the acting is superb.",1168473600,11,208,4.358974358974359
8086530,2,B000BGQUGG,"A reclusive woman keeps a man who drifts ashore under the idea that they are on an unknown island.  This is potentially deep.  It touches upon ideas that woman needs man, or vice versa, heterosexually speaking.  It hints that even misanthropes need companionship sometimes.  Still, the movie also felt like ""Misery"" repeated.  I hated watching James Spader's character be duped.  This movie was long and had few sounds and dialogue.  It seemed artsy and noir, in the French kind of way.  This is an arthouse film, certainly not meant for the masses.  I actually missed out on some of the dialogue because the lead actress' accent was so thick.  This DVD really needed captions.  This could be a deep meditation on the human condition, but it's still a bit of a yawner.",1141344000,12,768,4.742424242424242
