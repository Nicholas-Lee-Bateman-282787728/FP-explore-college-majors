2737533,4,B000MNOX9O,"I'm a huge fan of Kubrick.  This film is not about him or his style--with the exception of the music--which is virtually a free-standing element.  The music is from various Kubrick films.

Conway wasn't even well-versed in Kubrick lore--he was conning people more ignorant than he was.

Overall, it's rather depressing and disturbing--if, like me, you are easily influenced.  Conway is miserable in every sense, and a poor excuse for a human being.  His marks are somewhat pathetic.

But it's an excellent film, both in how it's put together, and because of Malkovich.  He brings his sly glee to what would have been a joyless exercise in perversity.

I agree with R.Z. that this has a somewhat 1-note quality, but disagree that there are any poignant moments.  This film avoids any sort of poignancy entirely.  Not a feel-good movie.  But a short con is not a Gacy.  To compare them is insane.  Conway may be a hollow man, but he's no serial killer.

Oh, and Malkovich's *accents* are worth the price of admission.",1182384000,4,1015,4.786127167630058

2737536,4,B000MNOX9O,I found this movie as disturbing as Gacy.  John Malkovich really pulls it off well.  A great movie isn't always about feeling good when it is over.  I was uncomfortable at various points but had to see it and definately did not fall asleep.,1179273600,,240,4.409090909090909
2737537,3,B000MNOX9O,"A must see for any Kubrick lover solely for Malkovich's telling of Conway's infamous con. The film has an extraordinarily weird and almost cringing feeling throughout partially due to Conway's character and partially due to the affectless acting of several characters.

Based on the teasers I was expecting the movie to be chocked full of Kubrick references but after seeing the film I am sadly disappointed. The Kubrick references are few and far between and most are so obvious you almost feel like you've been slapped in the face. Kubrick tended to see his audience as extremely observant and would leave his films chalked full of details. It's sad that the director of this film couldn't follow suit.

Overall the storyline is hilarious and offers an impressively accurate look into one of the most unique aspects of Kubrick's history.",1175731200,2,839,5.028776978417266

""Color Me Kubrick"" will remind you a bit of Steven Spielberg's ""Catch Me if You Can,"" in which Leonardo Di Caprio played a world-class con artist who duped people into believing he was a myriad of Very Important People whom he was really not.  In ""Colour Me Kubrick,"" the imposter is a man named Alan Conway who goes about London telling people he is the famed (and famously reclusive) director, Stanley Kubrick, in order to bum rides, free drinks and even sexual favors off of them.  I guess it's appropriate that I just happened to catch this film on April 1st of all days.

Written by Andrew Frewin and directed by Brian W. Cook, ""Color Me Kubrick"" is clearly a godsend for its star, John Malkovich, who seems to be having the time of his movie-acting life doing this role.  Malkovich tailors his demeanor and accent to fit the audience to whom he is playing, running the gamut from Capote-esque fey for his gay ""clients"" (Conway is himself gay) to regular-guy macho for his straight targets.  Yet, Malkovich never resorts to mere playacting to create his effect; by fully inhabiting the character, he keeps Conway from descending into a merely clownish figure and allows him to register as a fully developed human being.

Unfortunately, although the screenplay is frequently witty and even downright hilarious at times, the movie itself is never quite as good as Malkovich is in it.  Despite its overall originality, there's an innate one-note quality to the setup that the movie cannot completely shake, so that, even at a mere eighty-six minutes, the conceit tends to wear a bit thin after awhile.  The filmmakers somewhat make up for that weakness by also showing us the means by which Conway is eventually unmasked for all the world to see.  There are also a number of surprisingly poignant moments in the film in which we are shown just how sad, lonely and pathetic an individual Conway really is.  The most touching sequence comes when a movie-savvy young man in a bar uncovers Conway's ruse by trapping him with a trick Stanley Kramer question.  As Conway slinks away from the scene humiliated and crestfallen, we can clearly see why Malkovich is one of the finest actors of his generation.

Beyond the Conway character, the film provides a gently satirical jab at our culture's overwhelming obsession with celebrity and our willingness to suspend critical judgment on a person or a scheme if we can discern a benefit for ourselves by doing so.  For, indeed, virtually everyone who allows himself to be duped by this impersonator has starry-eyed dreams of one day making it big in either the entertainment business or the world of corporate financing.  Conway has merely come up with a clever way of exploiting that obsession for his own personal benefit.

There's also something wryly humorous in the fact that, although Kubrick is universally recognized as being one of the greatest directors in the history of cinema, his face was so unfamiliar to both the general populace and even people in the movie industry that Conway was able to pull this ruse off for so long without getting caught.  Can anyone imagine an individual trying that same stunt with Spielberg, Tarantino, Scorsese, etc.?

This is a slight but endearing comedy that is a must-see for John Malkovich fans.",1175385600,13,3295,4.853571428571429
2737539,4,B000MNOX9O,"""Color Me Kubrick"" is the true story of a how a man pretended to be Stanley Kubrick, during the time Kubrick was filming ""Eyes Wide Shut."" The man was Alan Conway, who looked nothing like Kubrick (a known recluse) and knew little about his films. In ""Color Me Kubrick,"" Conway is played by John Malkovich, sporting several phony accents and whose performance is campy, but accurate. The film is low on plot; We simply watch Conway con people into thinking he's Kubrick, so he can take advantage of them for free money, free drinks, free cab fare, free sex, etc. Eventually, as his victims begin to grow in number, newspapers begin to catch on. Since John Malkovich is in almost every scene of the film, he's the person that truly carries it. Any fan of Malkovich will tell you that his performance works best when he's using his regular voice; There's a cold, reserved, iciness to it...It seems whenever he breaks away from his bad guy roles into his good guy roles, his voice will change ('Of Mice & Men' & 'Shadow of the Vampire'). Here it changes a lot, but his performance is nevertheless great. The story is very interesting too, because Conway managed to convince so many people and actually ruined people's lives as a result of pretending to be someone he wasn't. In a bit of irony to end all irony, Conway died three months before Kubrick of a heart attack. The film, which was released on DVD and in some theatres at the same time (usually, in my opinion, a bad sign to the quality of the film), is very well made; Filled with in-jokes and little bits of Kubrick trivia. The movie uses a soundtrack that frequently incorporates legendary music from Kubrick's films (music from ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" and ""A Clockwork Orange,"" and more...). One scene, where Conway is asked about his next film and who is going to be in it, he answers; ""John Malkovich. But Warner Brothers says he's not big enough to carry the film."" The film is not perfect, I would've liked to know a little more about Conway...Why he chose Kubrick, why he chose to impersonate anybody at all, his past before impersonating Kubrick...But for the kind of movie it is, ""Color Me Kubrick"" is a mildly funny, very entertaining film with a great performance by John Malkovich and is worth checking out if you're a fan of Kubrick or Malkovich.

2737540,1,B000MNOX9O,God awful movie pretending to be a movie about film god. Excruciating plot lines and uninspired characters makes your humble narrator cringe at every scene. All work and no play makes John Malkovich a dull boy indeed.,1175299200,2,217,4.891891891891892
2737541,3,B000MNOX9O,"I saw the trailer for this film recently on IMDB and just thought this movie was going to be wicked. I have always loved a lot of John Malkovich's work, and he's one of the best character actors that doesn't rely on good looks to capture attention like Phillip Seymour Hoffman. First of all, this is not a biopic and it would be entirely disappointing if you wanted to see this movie for that purpose. The plot is focus on a con artist named Alan Conway who is mentally dysfunctional and has to make believe that he's someone else, and ultimately copies Stanley Kubrick and deceives Kubrick's unsuspecting fans for financial benefits and other things. The story is rather weak and it's kind of like a documentary situation comedy, but Malkovich is totally funny and it's his performance that makes this film more watchable. His character  is flamboyant, chubby, Vodka drinking, chain smoking, and very greedy of course. There was this one scene when he took a very expensive pen with a receipt back to the store to get a refund and got rejected, because it was purchased on credit card by the person who gave it to him. Conway is a very sad and disillusional man, and he had reached the point of insanity gradually when he can't even switch back to his true self.",1175299200,,1263,4.588495575221239

2737554,3,B000MNOX9O,"I watched my first pure Netflix fiction film, as opposed to documentary, and it was not good. I was going to watch In The Mood For Love, by Wong Kar-wai, but the picture could not include all of the subtitles at the bottom. The same was true with Masaki Kobayashi's Samurai Rebellion, but that, too, had issues with the framing out of subtitles. Reported both problems, so that dampened the mood for foreign films. Then I came across a 2006 comedy and drama called Color Me Kubrick: A True...ish Story, which is about the noted 1990s impersonator of Stanley Kubrick- a gay man who used Kubrick's own hermitry to his advantage, since few knew what the real Kubrick looked like. People may recall when New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of his encounter with the imposter, Alan Conway, at a restaurant. This chance meeting led to Conway's eventual downfall and exposure, and was one of the seminal events in what might be termed the `Modern Celebrity Crazy Fan Age' which includes stalkers and impersonators. As mild as my renown is, restricted to online arts and film venues, even I've had stalkers and impersonators. But, whereas some celebrities ended up being killed by their pursuers, Conway never sought Kubrick, only to use his name to his own advantage; an idea which fascinated Kubrick, according to reports. It was even rumored that Kubrick considered a screenplay on his own impersonator, but both Conway and Kubrick died before anything could come of it.",1340236800,,1476,4.861111111111111
2737555,5,B000MNOX9O,"Prior to seeing this film I always viewed Stanley Kubrick not as the recluse that so many attributed to him but as an artist who guarded his privacy.  After seeing ""Color Me Kubrick"" and learning of his unwillingness to come forward to expose the conman who stole his identity I'm not so sure.  Intriguingly enough this didn't even play the indie houses in Philly on initial release despite the generally good reviews I read.  The film I found to be very cheeky in a British kind of way.  It works on many levels.  For Kubrick buffs you can glory in the references to his films and his personal bio which his impersonator, Alan Conway(John Malkovich), generally gets wrong.  I love it when Conway in his Kubrick ruse alludes to his son.  Kubrick had daughters.  It also shows the willingness of people to be taken in by celebrity.  Certainly Kubrick kept a low profile but enough was known about him that even the most gullible would be suspicious.  Real life and this trueish story debunks that theory.  Primarily though this is an ideal showcase for John Malkovich.  Not since ""Being John Malkovich"" where he took on his own persona does Malkovich deliver a performance with such relish.  He's flying without a net in assaying this larcenous flamboyant souse.  Conway could come off as a caricature and there are enough surreal moments here but Malkovich makes the character both funny and sympathetic despite the terrible things he does.  As a Kubrick buff I enjoyed the film immensely but I'm not certain that those unfamiliar would like it as much. As a postscript Marisa Berenson who played Lady Lyndon in ""Barry Lyndon"" has a bit here as drama critic Frank Rich's wife.  Though she has few lines here she probably has more to say than Kubrick allowed her to speak in his film.",1294617600,,1783,4.703225806451613

For the Kubrick fan, certain shots as well as the music will resonate, reminding you of Kubrick's films.  Both the writer and the director were both long-time Kubrick associates and the extras on the DVD are well worth watching to hear their take on the director and this film.

And Malkovich is hilarious.  He's frivolous, flamboyant, drunk--in short, he's a wreck but always amusing to watch.  That he changes accents from scene to scene is hilarious in itself.  The rest of the cast is also very funny.  Look fast for British director Ken Russell as a mental patient (he's the one with the black-faced doll screeching in a reference to SPARTACUS, ""I am Stanley Kubrick!  I am Stanley Kubrick!"").

John Malkovich is delicious as gay Alan Conway posing as Stanley Kubrick. Stanley Kubrick is said to have been intrigued by Conway and the movie reflects this silliness and mischievousness. The movie is also a tale of debauchery that goes unpunished and thus serves no moral value. Then again, who needs moral fiber in a movie this entertaining?",1265500800,,492,4.869047619047619

It's amazing that this sociopath was able to get away with impersonating the great director for so long.  Whatever - mostly, it's a hilarious comedy in which Malkovich (as one reviewer put it snidely, but for me was what made it great) really chews the scenery.  The costumes are brilliant - the posing, the accents (different for every con) - it all made me howl with laughter.  You could say this film is a ""guilty pleasure"" since you know what he's doing to people is bad, bad, bad, but you can't help wanting more, more, more.  In the end, the imposter went unpunished, and died of ""natural"" causes.  That's a little hard to swallow.  One wanted him to get his legal comeuppance.

2737572,2,B000MNOX9O,"Although it pains me to say it, I sometimes wonder, especially after seeing a film like ""Color Me Kubrick,"" if the Malkovich legend doesn't outstrip the Malkovich talent.  He was superb, for example, in the too little known ""Klimt"" and pretty good in the Hollywood tear-jerker ""Dangerous Liasons.""  But his performance in ""Being John Malkovich,"" an excellent film with some excellent acting by Catherine Keener and Cameron Diaz, was mixed.  In ""Color Me Kubrick,"" it's so bad that, to give Malkovich the benefit of the doubt, one wants to think it's deliberately so.  But even this doesn't reduce the film's tedium.

Malkovich plays the role of a small-time con artist, one Alan Conway, who scammed his way through a few years by pretending to be Stanley Kubrick.  Like all good scam artists, Conway (at least as portrayed by Malkovich) adapted his character to fit the expectations of his marks.  But the different persona portrayed in the film--Conway the gay seducer, Conway the entrepreneur, Conway the guy's guy, Conway the Hollywood mover and shaker--are reduced by Malkovich to eventually tiresome caricatures.  Conway the gay man comes across as simpering and swishy (reminiscent of the horrible parody of femininity Malkovich presents in one scene in ""Being John Malkovich), insecure, weepy.  Conway the guy's guy (who tries to scam a couple of metal rockers) is loud and brash and pushy--the typical Ugly American.  Conway the mover and shaker is an equally stereotyped portrayal of a guy who can pick up a phone, call somebody in Hollywood, and get things done.  All that's needed to fill out the caricature was a big, $10 cigar.  And on it goes.  Each persona played by Malkovich is over the top.  There's no finesse at all in his performances, and one finds oneself glancing at one's watch way before the film is over.

Perhaps the film wanted to make the point that each of the types impersonated by Conway/Malkovich are strawmen, insubstantial ghosts that our insubstantial culture births.  Perhaps the director wanted to suggest that our culture's celebrity-mania is so extreme that we'll embrace even the shallowest of persons.  But surely both points could've been gotten across without having Malkovich hitting us over the head with his buffoonish acting.

That's the bad news.  On the up side is the performance of veteran British actor Peter Bowles (of ""Rumpole"" fame) as the manager of a posh seaside resort.  Although he has a small role, Bowles handles it beautifully.

2737574,4,B000MNOX9O,"I finally ordered this DVD at the urging of a friend and ardent movie buff. I'm glad I took his advice. Directed by Brian Cook, ""Color Me Kubrick"" stars John Malkovich as a real-live con-artist whose real name is Alan Conway. As gay as pink lemonade, Conway-- aptly named-- ""cons"" a lot of people into giving him money and expensive gifts by posing as the reclusive film director Stanley Kubrick. The movie belongs to Malkovich for his camp over-the-top performance that delights the viewer for 90 minutes or so. His costumes defy description and have to be seen to be believed. There are lots of hooty moments here as Conway convinces his unwary victims that he is Kubrick. Only rarely is he found out. In one scene he rattles off a list of his films-- he is always working on some new project and might use the talents of his latest quest-- and includes ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" as one of his. At least he got the ""Stanley"" correct since Stanley Kramer directed that one.

There are references here and there throughout the film to Kubrick movies including much of the music he used. In addition to being a sad commentary ultimately about a man who is no one but a no one who gets away with this hoax-- he ultimately meets his waterloo when the American journalist Frank Rich meets him and exposes him-- ""Color Me Kubrick"" makes a statement about celebrity worship.

Although a much better film, ""Six Degrees of Separation"" is also based on a true story of a gay man (Will Smith) who poses as Sidney Poitier's son and fools a lot of the pretentious New York art world for a season. While two examples of gay people impersonating the rich and famous do not a significant statistical sample make, perhaps the phenomenon should be further explored.",1192406400,12,1746,4.629032258064516

I rarely felt sorry for anyone in this flick; they all get about what they deserve.

Made by Kubrick's favorite AD, it's actually very well shot and cut, quite a fine little film in its own fashion. Malkovich makes it all work; the guy is totally individual and has great instincts in front of the camera.

The movie purports to tell the story of Alan Conway, an alcoholic homosexual,  who for many years, while Kubrick was alive, posed as Kubrick. Pretending to be Kubrick, Conway defrauded numerous people and seduced innumerable starstruck young men, who were awed by his claim to be the famous director. Frewin's script perpetuates the scandals that Alan Conway generated during Kubrick's lifetime.

Kubrick never sued Conway....because he knew that a suit would only cost him time and money in (a rigged) court system...and Alan Conway could easily be replaced by another paid scam artist.  Frewin's script  perpetuates the ""fun"" of dragging Kubrick's name through the mud by disguising the slander as a humorous romp through the life of Conway's antics. Frewin's script is one long ""association"" of Kubrick's name with sodomy, fraud, alcoholism and second-rate talent. Hmmm.

Why bother speaking ill of (writing scripts slandering) the dead?
Kubrick's movies about the crimes of the Elite infuriated the Powerful Oligarchy who had once supported him.  Apparently the most egregious of Kubrick's offenses was his movie ""The Shining,"" in which he covertly revealed his role in filming the Apollo Moon Landing Hoax.  Kubrick's unforgivable offense of exposing his role in filming the  Apollo Fraud was explained in the movie ""Wag the Dog"" in which Dustin Hoffman's character ""Stanley"" filmed a phony war for use on the TV news. Hoffman's ""Stanley"" was warned not to take credit for the phony ""news"" story, but he ignored the warning...and was 'heart-attacked.""  Kubrick himself seems to have been ""cerebral-hemorrhaged."" Three months after Kubrick's death, Conway also died. Evidently Conway's services were no longer needed. Indeed, he was now a liability -- a potential blackmailer and an unnecessary expense.

Prior to Kubrick's  finishing his movie ""Eyes Wide Shut"" (an expose of the Central Banking Elite's rampant pedophilia), Kubrick was given Hollywood's Life Achievement Award.  This is SOP for the Hollywood Whackers....first comes the award ceremony; then, the bullet in the back of the head. (Follow the careers of those who received Comrade Stalin's awards.)
It must have tormented Kubrick to have his Iago, Frewin, lurking about, taking notes ....but, well, you know the saying, ""Better the devil that you know.""",1467590400,2,2549,5.3375

Recently, I went on a Kubrick film binge. -For quite some time now, I've appreciated the more-recognized works of his (namely 2001, A Clockwork, Eyes Wide, Shining, Full Metal), but it wasn't until recent that I finally managed to explore all the rest. Unfortunately, Stan only managed to complete 13 films in his time (if you count ""Fear & Desire"" that is), and it was definitely a sad day when I realized there were no longer going to be films of his left to discover/experience for the ""first"" time. ): The good news? -Stan's movies are still among some of the MOST REWATCHABLE in film history... Anyhow, to those that have run out of Kubrick content, & aren't exactly in the mood for rewatching ""The Shining"" for the 19th time, yet still seeking some sort of supplement.. I can certainly recommend ""Color Me Kubrick"", a true-ish story about a deranged/pathetic phony (brilliantly portrayed by John Malkovich) who goes about the majority of his days assuming the persona of Mr. Stanley Kubrick~reclusive filmmaker. While seeming to know very little about the actual famous director, the phony manages to pull off the gimmick again and again, benefiting heavily from those he can fool. (Apparently something ""like"" this actually went down during the late 90s while Kubrick was in the middle of production on Eyes Wide Shut).The filmmakers could have shot the picture traditionally, yet due to what the material involved, they chose to have fun with it, and to the best of their abilities, attempted shooting it the way Kubrick 'might' go about a project. There's an endless amount of nods to Kubrick works, and the soundtrack itself even features tunes from a number of his films (Wendy Carlos tracks & such). Malkovich is simply excellent in portraying this rather-disturbing personality. -The performance is a real highlight, and he never plays it too over the top. The character may have audience members feeling a bit uncomfortable at times, but I'd say the film as a whole manages to pull off its dark-comedy intentions. -Found myself laughing out loud multiple times. Again, I can happily recommend this picture to all those in need of a supplement to actual Kubrick material. As far as style goes, NO, this film doesn't always pull off its Kubrickian goals, and some of the nods feel a tincy-bit forced at times, but I can definitely still appreciate the efforts behind it. 7 out of 10 for me!",1428537600,,2426,4.848192771084338

8170321,4,B000MNOX9O,As usual John Malkovich is brilliant. The movie incidentally sheds light on Kubrick's personality and movie-making genius. Well done film.,1401667200,,138,5.95
8170322,4,B000MNOX9O,"I was shocked to see comments calling this ""one of the worst movies I've ever seen"" or ""John Malkovich doing nothing special."" For those of us who enjoyed this film, it was a colorful, amusing and intriguing look into a real-life scam that one man managed to pull off for years. It also seems some people didn't notice what Malkovich was doing, which was an unusual and unique bit of acting that I've never seen before. He's an American actor portraying a British man trying to do an American accent...but very badly. I thought it was genius the way he was able to accomplish that.

For the record, this is *based* on a true story--some of the particulars are a little different than the actual story, and the character Malkovich creates is far different than the actual person (in real life, he was a much more reserved and less outgoing figure). However, the deviations only spruce up the telling, and it stays close enough to the truth that we can genuinely marvel at the real-life audacity of this impostor.",1390953600,2,1011,4.648044692737431
