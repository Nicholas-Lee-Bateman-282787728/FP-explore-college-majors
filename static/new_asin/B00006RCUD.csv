1789370,4,B00006RCUD,"This is a great movie for a ""Scary Movie"" night or a Halloween party showing. It is very dated, but lots of fun. The cast is very talented and as a plus you get to see a very young Harrison Ford just barely before the superstardom that Star Wars brought him. (He plays a teacher, pay close attention to how he writes on the chalkboard in the same way as his performance in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark!). Pop some popcorn and enjoy!",1286668800,4,428,4.168674698795181

Obviously located the film again and to be honest and considering the era (1970's) I still thought it was a good film (probably a spin off from the Exorcist),1276041600,,295,4.381818181818182

1789374,4,B00006RCUD,"This was one of the scariest movies to me when I was a child. I saw this movie in the late seventies on TV. It starts off like a lot of horror movies of the era and starts out a little bit slow. It is one of the few movies that Harrison Ford was in but don't hear about. It also stars James Farrentino who was a well known actor of the time. It starts out in a girls prepartory school and strange things start happening. Mysterious fires start to happen for no apparent reason and Farrentino's character which was a priest who dies at the beginning is sent back to fight evil. Also, Harrison Ford's character meets a particularly guesome fate. At the end, one the characters at the school becomes possessed and Farrentino's character must do battle with them. The special effects of this scene are pretty good for the time and the creepy atmosphere that the film and music create are great. A must see for any fan of this film genre.",1225843200,,933,4.337142857142857
7972698,1,B00006RCUD,"As a fan of horror movies, especially those that deal with possession, I was expecting this film to be enjoyable. After seeing multiple positive reviews, I ordered it and anxiously awaited it's arrival. I thought, based on all the great feedback, that somehow I had missed a great, 70's made for TV scare fest in the vein of ""Crowhaven Farm"", ""Gargoyles"", ""Don't Be Afraid of the Dark"", etc.

After watching this stagnant, slow moving morass of bad scenes strung together in an unfathomable jumble, I was confused. How did so many folks like this? Understand that I don't think it is bad, I think it's unwatchable. To me, it lacked tension, atmosphere, continuity and any sense of gravitas. When the possession finally occurs, the involved characters act in a nonchalant manner at best. Their attitude towards unholy evil is laugh out loud sad.

Additionally, the DVD is as bare bones as possible. Maybe I am the odd man out on this, but I cannot recommend this movie to anyone. I wouldn't even suggest it as a ""so bad it's good"" treat! Avoid.",1508112000,,1043,4.725274725274725

7972705,5,B00006RCUD,"If you liked ""The Initiation of Sarah"" & the original ""Satan's School for Girls"", this tv flick is definitely for you!! It clips along at a quick pace & is quite entertaining, saw it as a teenager & it's better than I remembered. Basic tv movie thrills/scares are really heightened by Oscar winner Leonard Rosenman's extremely effective music which just seems to crescendo out of nowhere half the time - it turns what could've been a run-of-the-copycat-mill tv movie into something you want to watch more than once. Top billed James Farentino is nowhere near as interesting as the rest of the cast - Claudette Nevins, Ann (Jaws 2) Dusenberry, Diana Scarwid (three years before her Oscar nom for Inside Moves), Dinah Manoff (Grease was her next year bonanza), wonderful & very underrated PJ Soles (she doesn't get much to do, Halloween was fortunately next year) & Harrison Ford as the randy biology teacher. For once, Joan Hackett's hypertensive neurotic routine works to her advantage here, definitely ups the creepy quotient. Only minor quibbles I've got with The Possessed are that the good/bad showdown didn't last longer & nobody seems to be really upset by all the possessed shenanigans (watching movie number of times it actually gets to be quite hilarious, there's no hysterics, it's like they're watching a school debate that gets messy) - but those things aside, The Possessed is a most welcome addition to my 70s tv movie/miniseries collection - Warner Archives is a godsend!!",1380672000,3,1487,5.0
7972706,5,B00006RCUD,"I loved this dvd,
Its just as scary as it was the first time I watched it.
A few twists that I did not remember as well, made it fresh.
I would recommend this dvd to anyone who wants to be scared, while sitting by the fire on a dark damp night with a cup of hot chocolate.
plenty of twists in it..",1376784000,,297,3.7301587301587302
7972707,4,B00006RCUD,"This show was produced in the golden age of television when they produced two hour shows known as "" movie of the week ""
