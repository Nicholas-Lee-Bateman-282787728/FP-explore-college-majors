2991768,2,B000WTVZEO,Thanks for presenting this in the wrong video format.  It's stretched out to 16x9 when it was obviously filmed in 4x3 standard.  Everyone and everything is widdddddde-ass. Someone out there get a clue.,1302739200,,201,5.0606060606060606
2991769,3,B000WTVZEO,"I have seen all but Boys Life 2 in the 6 series collection.  Boys Life 6 is probably the biggest disappointment in the series.

Here's a review of the each of the 4 films:

""Bugcrush"" (2 Stars) - This is disturbing.  Enough said.  I would not likely watch this again, unless I was doing some sort of a psychology project.  I liked a few elements early, and would have enjoyed the development of such a storyline.  I am sure many can relate to the character of Ben, the introverted gay teen.  For many gay men who grew up 2 or 3 decades ago, ""being gay and being a teen"" were not an easy combination.  Ben fawns over the odd, tough newcomer to his school, Grant.  The guy is edgy, not the most attractive guy you have ever met, but the complete opposite of Ben.  For Ben, it's a challenge, a desire many of us cannot understand.  It wells up inside, and we want, or must have, that which is not good for us.  In the 37 minutes of the film, this is exactly what happens.  Against the advice of his friends, Ben reaches out to Grant, and to his surprise, is welcome into his realm.  He quickly and mistakenly trusts Grant, who takes advantage of Ben and with 2 other creepy friends, head up to a remote area where Grant lives.  What happens in this home, as it relates to abuse, bugs, alcohol, and people who have no compassion for human life is troubling.  I wish the film could have been done differently to reach teens like Ben and teach them how to protect themselves.  Would you have turned before driving that far out of town, or would you continue into risk?  When matters of the heart, and being gay, and thinking you're being accepted play factors, it's not so easy to make the right decisions.  Note: If you have a fear of bugs, do NOT watch Bugcrush!  It was almost more then I could take, and I've seen a lot.

""Doorman"" (No Stars) - This isn't even worth taking time to write about.  Some sadistic tale about a doorman, and a tenant.  Neither of whom know how to speak apparently.  I didn't get it.  I would like those 17 minutes of my life back.

""Davy and Stu"" (5 Stars) - It's the best film on this collection!  A true short-film at 13 minutes, this and the last title are the salvation of this DVD.  This is still a quirky story, but I liked it.  I quickly connected with the character of Davy (played by Travis Walters), the younger of the 2 lads in my estimate.  His acting was excellent!  It's coming of age, young love, and the pain associated with it - well conceived in just a dozen minutes.  I wish this film could have been the longest of the collection, as it would have been great to see more of this relationship dynamic.

""Heartland"" (3 Stars) - The other highlight of this DVD.  It's about a young Iowa farm boy who has been living a taste of the big city lights with his charming boyfriend.  He ends of back on the farm to help his Dad, and ends up coming out to a close high school friend.  His Dad hears the news in the small town and takes hiding with his bottle of booze.  The hot farmhand hired by his Dad also learns the news, and well, it gets a tad predictable.  The idea/concept behind this story is excellent, and I am sure many young men who dream of city lights vs. farm living can identify with this short.",1205193600,2,3247,4.252045826513911

2991771,5,B000WTVZEO,"I can't get over what an AMAZING movie Bugcrush is, I was riveted to my seat, and have showed it to all my friends who were all blown away.  Don't want to give anything away, but be prepared for a ride you've never taken!",1202169600,7,221,4.0227272727272725
2991772,3,B000WTVZEO,"I've seen all six of Stand Releasing's ""Boys Life"" compilations, and
you certainly can't say they left the best for last. (In my opinion,
the first was the best, and it has gone progressively downhill since
then.)

The rating overall is an average for the four-film compilation,with each one also rated individually below:

BUGCRUSH (2006). A young gay high schooler develops an instant crush on the new ""bad boy"" at school, who immediately becomes part of the cool (and weird/goth) guys at school.  When the new boy recognizes the gay boy's attention, he convinces him to go with two others boys to his empty house out in the country. There, the trip takes a detour from ""hanging out with friends"" to a rather sinister seduction scenario, based on the new boy's obsession with little poisonous bugs.  Well acted and creative, but I object to the message it sends in the end.  2 stars out of 5.

DOORMAN (2006). The Latino doorman at a NYC apartment building has a steamy affair with a young man who lives in the building, and the subsequent rejection by him bothers him far more than he thought it would. Not much here, but the acting conveys the emotions well. 3 stars out of 5.

DAVY AND STU (2006). Reinforcing the concept of ""opposites
attracting,"" two very different Scottish boys meet most nights in a
swampy bog, trying to negotiate their feelings for each other. Sweet and realistic, not real entertaining. 3 stars out of 5.

HEARTLAND (2007). A 21 year old gay NYC photographer travels back to his father's Iowa farm to help him save the farm from financial ruin. Along the way he comes out to his high school sweetheart, and the news travels back to his father, who doesn't take it well. Meanwhile, he makes friends with Ryan, his father's hunky young farmhand. Best of the bunch, 4 stars out of 5.
