Early on in this film, you hear a young Bill Hewlett talking about how both his wife and also Dave Packard's wife worked and financially supported their husbands during the founding of HP. Dave Packard admits in his later years that ""We didn't know it at the time, but we were in the right place at the right time.""

Steve Jobs talks about his motivations and philosophy of life from a 1994 interview at NeXT Computer. Larry Ellison of Oracle talks about having his briefcase searched after a failed attempt to talk with venture capitalists. There's Meg Whitman at eBay, Nolan Bushnell from Atari, Gordon Moore and Andy Grove from Intel. The founders of Intuit, Adobe, NVIDIA, Apple, Sun Microsystems, and dozens of others that talk about their struggles and challenges; they even threw in a few Renaissance experts to compare the similarities between the two periods of history.

I've watched all of the documentaries on Silicon Valley and most of them seem to be filmed in a week or two. None of them can compare to the depth and scope of this documentary.",1383523200,4,1333,4.78695652173913

This is by far the most intimate and best representation of what happens in Silicon Valley. The DVDs accurately depict Silicon Valley as a unique way of thinking, as an unusual way of behaving and as the culture being very different from any other technology center. Comparisons have been made to places like Route 128. There is no doubt. Silicon Valley is an extraordinary place. These are extraordinary videos. A must see!",1345766400,3,574,4.86734693877551
