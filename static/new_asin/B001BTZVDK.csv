8284953,5,B001BTZVDK,"We Love Miffy and all her simplicity! Great DVD without a million ads to skip over while you're kids freak out. These are all pricey for fairly short DVDs, but we thought it was worth it since both of our kids like Miffy. It's a good before nap or bed show.",1421539200,,257,4.0588235294117645
8284954,5,B001BTZVDK,This dvd is great.  We just love Miffy!  Miffy can do no wrong.  We have every Miffy dvd there is.,1316736000,,98,3.8
8284955,3,B001BTZVDK,"Older son loved Miffy, wanted younger one to be able to enjoy it too.  Language is clear and simple storylines.  Dvd is easy play with good episodes.  Only disadvantage is that theme song does not play at start of each episode, and we loved the song.",1276560000,,250,4.391304347826087
8284956,5,B001BTZVDK,"Every time we find a new Miffy video, we are excited. She's an adorable bunny and beloved by both children in our house. We wish we could find more Miffy shows to purchase.",1273190400,,172,4.242424242424242
8284957,5,B001BTZVDK,"My daughter adores Miffy and Friends. It is just the right pace for a 2 year old. A nice narrated story format, no quick scene changes or flashing animation, or shouting etc. Very sweet and simple. Our 4 year old niece also loves watching too.",1245888000,,243,4.4222222222222225
8284958,5,B001BTZVDK,"I bought this video because I could no longer record them on nickelodeon as they quit airing it.... My oldest, now 5.5 yr old son, was a HUGE Miffy fan. So when my next child ""came along"" I wanted to introduce him to Miffy, too. They are 33 months apart. Unfortunately, its not aired on TV anymore. I like the Miffy videos because the graphics are what I consider acceptable. I do not like fast moving, busy, hurried graphics, etc. I highly recommend this if you are concerned about over-stimulation of videos.... Now, this is not to imply in any way that it is boring !!!  On the contrary. Miffy is VERY engaging. And remember, you must ""judge"" it through the eyes of a two-year old +/-. I would like to be able to purchase the actual videos that were aired on TV, but this is all I could find. Hope this helps.",1232582400,2,812,4.30718954248366
8284959,4,B001BTZVDK,"This is a bare bones DVD with no bonus features and no activity bumpers in between shorts. There are no previews to wade through, and the disc auto plays in its entirety after a 10-second countdown displayed onscreen. It's a bit short for the price, but includes some shorts not previously available on US DVD. Episode listing:

1. Miffy is Late for School
2. Miffy and Melanie Learn to Read
3. Miffy Makes and Bakes
4. Boris Tidies Up
5. Miffy and the Shadows
6. Snuffy Learns Patience
7. Boris Forgets Something
8. Miffy Counts the Trees
9. Miffy Finds the Cup",1221523200,8,562,4.509803921568627
