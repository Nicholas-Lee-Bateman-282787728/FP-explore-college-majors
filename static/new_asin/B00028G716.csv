2068486,1,B00028G716,"This indeed would be the best Betty Boop collection, if it were indeed the one that you get when you order.  Due to some confusion in the ISBN number, what you actually receive is a collection of 30 Betty Boop cartoons from Echo Bridge (not Platinum), which are the same old tired ones that are available elsewhere. None of the Cab Calloway's. Few or none of the pre-code. And definately not the set that is described here. I don't blame Amazon, because the same thing happened when I ordered it at Barnes the Noble. The description does not match the product.  I was very very disappointed.",1196208000,6,591,4.566037735849057

2068488,3,B00028G716,"no question.  the fletscher bros. betty boops are genius.

however, what these cartoons were best at was not just providing 7 minutes of goofy antics.  this is pre-code surrealism.  before cartoons were strictly for kids.  alice in wonderland before disney.

the ""definitive collection"" on VHS (pre-DVD) was fantastic: bimbo's initiation, any rags, barnacle bill, red hot momma.  it was also closed captioned.  (basically the scripts).  would have been wonderful if they simply could dump it onto the new media.

these titles (what makes betty boop arty masterpieces and not more of the cute tweety bird for kids slapstick) are not currently available however in any DVD sets.  and though this release claims to, there are no English subtitles or closed captioning.  (a lot of titles on Amazon are either incorrect or inexplicit in this regard.  watch out.)

there ARE some fantastic examples of rotoscoping techniques (particularly of cab calloway) that are worth seeing.  the visceral impact of the animation is startling.

the most interesting bb's are before '33, before grampy and pudgy.  if you like happy-go-lucky nice fun, these do try (though not as well as bugs or mickey).  imagine bugs, woody woodpecker and spoonge bob on halucinogenics, turned up about 4 times.  the bb's are an important historical point in cartooning, but these aren't really archives of that, mostly just entertainment for kids to watch.  hope they do justice too her some day.",1150070400,7,1461,5.162393162393163
2068489,4,B00028G716,"This is the best Betty Boop DVD set currently available, as it contains most of Betty's highest regarded shorts, including all three with jazz legend Cab Calloway (Snow White, Minnie the Moocher, & The Old Man of the Mountain).  If the storylines seem vague and abstract, that was the point.  Not only do they contain not-so-subtle drug references (listen in songs for ""smokey"", ""cokie"", & ""kicking the gong [heroin] around""), but they also evoke a surrealism one normally associates with haute culture filmmakers like Luis Bunuel.  And the great thing about this is you can watch it with your kids while they just enjoy the pretty images without a clue!

On the down side, the DVD won't allow any monkeying with the time view, has no subtitles which always help with the poor audio from early talkie cinema, makes you look at their annoying Platinum Video interlude between each episode, and the image quality is inferior to the earlier Goodtimes Betty Boop DVD releases.  But this is the best set yet available on DVD and it's so cheap you really can't lose by just buying it right now.",1106179200,30,1088,4.76595744680851

8023903,1,B00028G716,"I've been trying to collect a wide range of Betty Boop material, and unfortunately it's been difficult because most of the DVD offerings have many of the same cartoons, with some different packaging.  This CD set promised some of the more difficult to find, but in fact many of the cartoons listed are not in this set.  In fact, I bought this specifically for Minnie the Moocher and She Wronged Him Right- these are not in the set and this set is in fact a duplicate of another.

8023904,2,B00028G716,"In 2007 Echo Bridge issued new sets with the same covers, but reversed as to content and mixed around the contents as well.  As a result, if you are seeking specific cartoons, you cannot go by the well-meaning guide of earlier reviewers.  You are ALMOST CERTAIN to be disappointed.  I counsel avoidance of these Echo Bridge products unless, somehow, you are new to Fleischer animations and just seeking an introduction.",1316563200,,419,4.957142857142857
8023905,2,B00028G716,"I wanted Snow White in particular, but the product doesn't have it. The list given in another review is different from what is included here.
If Amazon would list the cartoons included, it would help customers to find what they want.",1268352000,,233,4.7073170731707314
8023906,2,B00028G716,"Apparently there are three sets with the same cover. I ordered this one, hoping to get a Betty Boop DVD with ""Minnie the Moocher,"" ""Snow White"" and some other pre-code classics. Unfortunately, only one of the sets with this front cover contains those episodes, and I was sent one of the other two by mistake. I was very disappointed when I looked on the back and found that the set contained only those toned-down post-code episodes you can get absolutely anywhere, with Henry, Grampy, Pudgy, etc. Don't order this set. There are other ones you can buy, and be certain that you're getting the correct episodes.",1261008000,,610,4.764150943396227
8023907,2,B00028G716,"Amazon does it again. This is NOT the Platinum Disc version it is the Echo Bridge version. This was mentioned in another review (see Very Very Disappointed, November 28, 2007) and Amazon has still not corrected it. When I called Amazon they referred me to the seller who did offer to take it back but I'll be out shipping both ways and it's just not worth it.",1257984000,,359,4.373134328358209
8023908,4,B00028G716,"The first talking picture, `The Jazz Singer' was released in 1927 .  It created a sensation and overnight the entire movie industry adopted sound in their productions, and the cartoon industry was not about to be left behind.  The Fleisher brothers abandoned their popular series of silent cartoons called `Out of the Inkwell' and created a series of 42 sound cartoons called TALKartoons from 1929 to 1932.  Many of these cartoons are now lost, but cartoon 08. TK. `Dizzy Dishes' (1930) was the first to feature a prototype of Betty Boop.  She developed in TALKartoons over a few short years to become the familiar figure we all know and love.  The last TALKartoon, 42. TK. `The Betty Boop Limited' (1932) marked a seamless transition to Betty Boop's own cartoon under the Paramount Pictures logo.  (There were 90 of these.)
  Aside from the ever-present main gripe of poor DVD production from poor prints, it is frustrating trying to collect Betty Boop cartoons without getting more duplicates.  I have four different sets, the first three of which are currently available here on Amazon.  The first set is a two disk set on the PLATINUM  label called, `Betty Boop: An Original Max Fleischer Cartoon.'  It has 23 cartoons of which TEN are not on the other sets:
34. TK. Minnie The Moocher (1932)
39. TK. Chess-Nuts (1932)
04. PP. Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle (1932)
07. PP. I'll Be Glad When You're Dead You Rascal You (1932)
13. PP. Snow-White (1933)
16. PP. Betty Boop's Big Boss (1933)
19. PP. The Old Man of the Mountain (1933)
21. PP. Morning, Noon and Night (1933)
23. PP. Parade of the Wooden Soldiers (1933)
24. PP. She Wronged Him Right (1934)
  As noted in other reviews, PLATINUM has their logo blaze annoyingly across the screen and speakers before each cartoon.  But if you look at the cartoons, the PLATINUM set definitely looks remastered and is much clearer and crisper.  (Compare cartoon 58. PP. `Be Human' which is on all three sets,)  Also, because the PLATINUM set is the only one that has any TALKartoons, it is further recomended over the others.
  The second set on the ECHO BRIDGE label is called `Betty Boop (Two-DIsk Collector's Edition)'  It has IDENTICAL ARTWORK and PACKAGING to the PLATINUM set.  The cartoons on this set look grey and fuzzy and there is not a `play all' option, and it has 30 cartoons only FOUR of which are unique to that set:
42. PP. A Language All My Own (1935)
47. PP. Little Nobody (1935)
59. PP. Making Friends (1936)
66. PP. Ding Dong Doggie (1937)
  The third two-disk set is from the DELTA label called, `The Ultimate Betty Boop Collection' (previously released as separate disks as `The Best of Betty Boop').  The cartoons in this set look dark and shadowy.  It has 25 cartoons, and it too has only FOUR of which are unique to that set:
45. PP. Making Stars (1935)
54. PP. You're Not Built That Way (1936)
61. PP. Whoops! I'm A Cowboy (1937)
82. PP. On With The New (1938)
  The fourth set is a collection one dollar disks on the DIGIVIEW label from China and are available at Wallmart.  I only mention these because they are the only ones who have cartoon, 40. PP. `No! No! A Thousand Times No!!' (Which is on every one of their disks.)",1214697600,11,3192,4.621669626998224
