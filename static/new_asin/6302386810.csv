7825133,2,6302386810,"Nearly a month later, it is done.  What began as a simple five films to watch, suddenly turned into a month long disaster, with the penultimate cinematic ""triumph"" arriving (and ending) with the uber-classy ""Young Lady Chatterley II"".  For those unfamiliar with this series, it centers on the exploits of a young American whom has newly discovered that she is the heir to the infamous Chatterley estate.  The first film sets the groundwork, or perhaps she does all the grounds people, but none the less - Young Lady Chatterley (youngly played by Harlee McBride) discovers her inner urges and never looks back.  This second film, which doesn't stray too far from the original's course, Chatterley is bombarded with new issues, disastrous sex, and a comedic Adam West.  Will the Chatterley estate become a nuclear power plant by evil developers?  Will West discover a historical nude ride that took place on her grounds?  Will she ever have naked time with the gardener?  Answer all of these questions AND throw in a priest for good luck, and you are just barely scratching the surface of this film.  Does this self proclaimed sequel live up to the lackluster excitement of the original?  This is a question to be answered by all those who watched Cinemax after midnight ... or for those eager enough to continue reading.

Hesitancy was in the air when this film arrived; an import from another land and the disappointment of the original; this was not a film one could get excited about.  The original tried to prove that lush scenery would already enhance the draw to an erotica film, and without worrying about plot, they poured the ""classic"" scenes on hot and heavy.  But, ""Young Lady Chatterley"" needed the plot to survive, due to the surprising inability for Harlee McBride to carry a scene.  Yet, in this sequel, she seems to have acquired a bit more talent (not to mention, being a bit more top-heavy) and the surrounding plots (as cheesy as they are) actually strengthens this sequel.  ""Young Lady Chatterley II"" is not a tour de force of cinema, but in comparison to the original, this one stands prouder.  The story is the initial keeper.  With the addition of the hilarious Adam West (who gets to throw in a ""Batman"" reference just for fun) and the evil developers who want nuclear power - it helps to keep this film's flow intact.  Keeping in mind that Chatterley still continues to be with any man that moves, it is what surrounds the frame - the path from A to B - that makes this more than just an erotic film.

Surprisingly directed by the same Alan Roberts that brought us the first film, he seems to have grown as well (no pun intended).  His editing was much stronger in this film as well as the fuller-wide shots and actual background seemed to be stepped up with more dedication to the story.  While some will argue that this is not quite a sequel, but instead a fresh retelling of the original ""Young Lady Chatterley"", for this reviewer it felt more like a sequel.  Nobody returned except for McBride (even the gardener - Peter Ratray - must have requested more money) and that is alright.  McBride seems more comfortable in the already flimsy role, and that works.  Her strength makes us ignore her tantalizing scenes and focus on what is happening around her.  We learn more about her character - by going to her past - which again, strengthens the plot; leading back to my earlier discussion.

This is not a great film.  Don't get me wrong.  My excitement for this film being stronger than the original comes from some of the issues I griped about earlier being answered - but it is not a film that needs to be watched again and again.  Adam West (a point to directors, if you don't think your film is funny enough or needs that cult stamp, throw in an Adam West and it jumps up several notches on the ""great"" scale) was a trip.  He had no real character, he kept looking into the camera, and he never was nude, but his lines were the most memorable out of the bunch.  Despite the West appearance, it still isn't cinema.  This entire series could have been a cult staple, perhaps like the ""Emmanuel"" series, but instead flopped due to lack of everything except erotica.

VIDEO:  Although they claim a R1 version of this film is coming, my R0 had to do the job.  Bare bones across the board, this could have perhaps been more entertaining with some extras and less subtitles.  DVD is always stronger than VHS for this type of film, so I can't complain - but if this is the furthest this film goes - I would be comfortable with that.

VISUAL:  A bare bones import DVD, this is nothing short of a VHS conversion.  In fact, there is several times where you could see the infamous reel change a la Tyler Durden as the film progressed.

SOUND:  Surprisingly strong in this film.  Nothing Dolby, but it was loud in my speakers.

EXTRAS:  Nothing.  Language, Scene, and that was it.  A commentary wouldn't have hurt this - I would like to hear what Roberts feels about this film nearly 26 years later.  His masterpiece or a joke among friends?

Overall, I cannot suggest this film at all.  While there were improvements, the overall completion of this series didn't make me want to go back and start again.  For me, it rests on Harlee McBride who is a terrible lead.  She cannot seem to control any of the scenes that she is in, and quintessentially always leads with her top.  Not surprisingly, the only excitement with this film is Adam West.  For those fans of his, this needs to be watched.
