5024094,5,B006WN5W9S,"Mikhail Baryshnikov is amazing. I have followed his work since he came to the USA in the '70's, and I still love his work and staging of ""The Nutcracker"" done approximately 1974, a classic and the best version of the Nutcracker ever made ...in my humble opinion.  I usually prefer tradition, but over the years this man has showed me that contemporary dance can be wonderful. This is a moving piece, but made better by the perfection that ""Misha"" brings to it. Rent it or better yet, buy it -- you will be glad you did!",1353456000,13,519,4.40625
5024095,5,B006WN5W9S,"Mats Ek is famous for his seemingly amusing, satirical choreography dealing with a variety of themes, from new approaches to the classics to mundane domestic themes. Mats Ek, himself, doesn't think of his work as satirical or comic, but it is hard for us, his audience, to see it differently. Sometimes, I think he is just pulling our leg; he knows it is funny stuff.(For example, in his Sleeping Beauty, she is taken to the hospital in a tiny car to deliver a baby).
In ""Place"" Ek seems to return to a domestic theme(compare this to his ballet, ""Apartment""). It is hard to pin down, but we have a table, rug, and, well, a place. We also have a man and a woman, also items found in an apartment. Exactly what ideas Ek has in mind for this, we may never know.
Ek's choreography is very modern and active; you don't have to worry about dancers just standing around looking helpless. They move! It is a modern style of dance, peculiar to Ek. Here, Baryshnikov and Laguna(she can also be seen as Giselle in Ek's Giselle, on DVD) look very comfortable and eager to dance this ballet, and work very well together.
This should appeal to fans of modern dance, Mats Ek, Baryshnikov and Laguna.",1333670400,14,1184,4.511627906976744
5024096,5,B006WN5W9S,"Place is a beautifully, skillfully choreographed by Mats Ek and performed by Mikhail Baryshnikov and Ana Laguna. I had the honor of seeing the premiere in Athens, Greece a few years ago and we gave them a standing ovation.  Dance teachers should order this to show their students and dancers should have it to be inspired by.",1331510400,17,325,4.701754385964913

8505700,5,B006WN5W9S,Wish I had be offered the Prime version. Hardly worth watching more than once. Misha dances but this is not his best. For true Misha order White Nights,1415404800,,151,4.428571428571429

8505702,5,B006WN5W9S,Speaks of the many talents of Misha. Very interesting. Unusal yet shows of the talent of Mikhail Baryshnikov and partner.,1373846400,2,121,5.1
8505703,2,B006WN5W9S,"Baryshnikov's name is magic to a ballet enthusiasts but this proved very disapointing.
Shorter than anticipated and the dancing and choreography lacked the strength and
the lustre expected from modern dance routines these days.
Very much like a rehearsal involving two aging dancers.  One is reminded  that dancers
have a short  performing lifespan .  Both artists perform well but do not expect any magic
here!",1370649600,2,411,5.276923076923077
8505704,5,B006WN5W9S,Two amazing dancers... in a wonderful Choreography. But Ana Laguna should be on the cover - she is a legendary dancer as well.,1361577600,,126,4.521739130434782

8505706,5,B006WN5W9S,"This seems a very contemporary piece... at first I think, ""Oh I just hate this..."" but I couldn't take my eyes off of it. Then, as I watch these funny little characters bloom, I think ""Well, their acting talent has survived..."" Then, as I watch, the movement becomes so well-matched to the characters, and the characters well-matched to each other. There is such reverence for each other in a sweetly acknowledged test of age. A loving and vital competition, full of sparkle-in-the-eye and one-ups-manship. It is elegant and expertly knitted with subtext to provide us with the passion that is still alive in the dance. Well done.",1360972800,6,630,4.897196261682243
8505707,3,B006WN5W9S,"I lean toward the traditional classical ballet and bought this because I wanted see anything more recent that showcased ""Misha.""

If you're familiar with Mats Ek's work, you know his ideas are, um, unconventional.  I won't even pretend to figure out what the story was about, but it was fun to see Baryshnikov in a setting that was completely outside his genre.

It's not as much fun as his works with Twyla Tharp.  At least those works make sense.

I would say, if you can get it from a library first, you'll make a better decision as to whether it's a piece you want to own.",1360713600,6,576,4.39622641509434
