HORRIBLE! HORRIBLE! I got so frustrated and found out it was a PIRACY dvd season!!! I want my money back...",1207526400,4,277,3.9642857142857144
8198173,5,B000QY3HAK,"A very sweet story of a poor girl who somehow falls in love with perhaps the  biggest bully in school.

A sweet, addictive plot that will keep you entranced.",1193270400,,157,4.379310344827586
8198174,5,B000QY3HAK,"If you like the anime or if you like the manga, you will LOVE this (both seasons). It's fantastic! And the main actors capture the characters so well! This is a review of the actual show, and not the DVDs, as I have never been able to find a place that sells them with English subtitles. And please, Amazon overlords, PLEASE stock this again. Some of us would really like to buy it...",1188086400,,384,4.273972602739726
8198175,5,B000QY3HAK,"J-Dramas are my guilty pleasure, and Hana Yori Dango is my absolute favorite.  I actually liked the television show better than the Manga.

The show is cute and predictable; a definite guilty pleasure.  If you're a sucker for romance (and humor) than this is the right purchase for you!",1186790400,,286,4.795918367346939
8198176,5,B000QY3HAK,"I wasn't sure about this series when I bought it [I was just excited about Shun Oguri playing the character Rui Hanazawa]-but it turned out to be absolutely AMAZINGGGGGG!!!!  So what if the music is alittle a little ""Harry Potter-ish""? Or the acting is alittle on the cheesey side?
This is a Japanese drama, People!!!  And I give it five stars for being one of the most addictive and highly entertaining series I've watched all year.  HECK-even my mom, who is not much of a fan of anime or the Japanese culture, made me promise to not watch a single episode without her!",1182902400,,570,4.514563106796117
8198177,5,B000QY3HAK,"Back when I started high school I became interested in manga. I remember going to the bookstore and seeing a manga named Boys over Flowers, or Hana yori Dango. I was skeptical but soon fell in love with this story of friendship, determination, and most of all love's destiny. Older now and no longer interested in manga, I fell upon the live action and was once again skeptical. The actors the picked for the two love interests, Rui and Tsukasa did not seem to fit the bill. But once again I fell in love! All of the actors portray the characters beautifully and have great chemistry between them. Though having read the manga before I felt like I was seeing this story for the first time! I highly reccomend this if you like beautiful love stories and cute boys!",1182384000,4,763,4.496402877697841
8198178,5,B000QY3HAK,"The series is based on the Japanese shoujo manga Hana Yori Dango by Kamio Yoko. There are other T.V. series verison, such as Meteor Garden, the Taiwanese version, but none as good as this one.

The director & producer did a magnificent job at making the T.V. series as good as the manga. The heart of the manga is felt within the show.

Bravo!
