3122399,5,B00144PA06,"Remington Steele was a truly stylish television show that tapped into the kind of Stanley Donen light mystery with romance that was missing from the movies. Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist were perfectly cast and the show only got better with each episode. The evocative Henry Mancini theme music captured the sense of mystery and romance perfectly.

Laura Holt (Zimbalist) couldn't get her private detective agency off the ground in spite of her skills until she invented the phantom agency head, Remington Steele. Business was booming and everything was going swell until Pierce Brosnan showed up and assumed the identity of the nonexistent Steele! Brosnan's Steele was debonair and stylish, his past a shady mystery ala' ""To Catch a Thief.""

Each season Laura discovered new things about his past in Ireland and his exploits in other countries. Steele was a classic film buff and would make constant references to films of the 1930's and 1940's pertaining to the case. It made all us film buffs who knew just what he was talking about feel like we were insiders, and was one of the many charms of this wonderful show.

Brosnan and Zimbalist were a terrific screen couple in the tradition of all those ones we remember fondly. There was a fun anticipation for viewers as week after week we watched the two become involved in a mystery while they danced around their growing affection for each other. And it was always fun as little tidbits of Steele's past were discovered by Laura. Season one had one of the best episodes (Vintage Steele) as the tables were turned and Steele got a glimpse at Laura's past!

The overall quality of the show improved with season two as Doris Roberts was added to the cast as Mildred Krebs, and two other characters were lost. The show became even more fun than before, and both Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist settled in for good as everyone's favorite TV couple. The show never looked back after season two began.

Season three's ""Steele Trying"" was perhaps the most representative episode of what Remington Steele was all about. Steele invents a case as a ruse so the two can whisk off for a romantic San Francisco weekend. It all goes awry, of course, when there turns out to be a very real case which interferes with all Steele's plans. Wonderful music and a romantic backdrop add to the fun as Remington and Laura have fun and a little romance along the way as they solve the mystery.

Brosnan and Zimbalist had a wonderful repore and viewers fell in love with Michael Gleason's show from the start. Both leads had a flair for comedy which was mingled with the romance and mystery, making for sophisticated fun. Doris Roberts added mightily to the feel of the show as she adored the ""Boss"" but loved Laura also. Both Brosnan and Zimbalist became creative forces behind the camera over time but it was Michael Gleason who made and kept the show fun and interesting week after week.

Few shows hold a soft spot in viewer's hearts like Remington Steele. It was romantic mystery and escapism for an hour each week and classic film fans especially loved this show. One of the best shows ever on television as pure entertainment. A must have for fans.",1213574400,62,3192,4.76130198915009

3122423,4,B00144PA06,"The discs were surprisingly ... well, ""scratched"" wouldn't be entirely accurate.  The cases for each season were packaged together into a single package, but it's clear that each season disc package was handled individually at some point in the past.  And when they were, they appear to have been terribly ""squashed"".  Since each package contains four double-sided discs, the discs at the ends rubbed against the packaging.  So, they are not technically scratched, but they are certainly marked.

Furthermore, I'm not sure how long the discs are going to last.  They show signs of delamination, and while they all read cleanly, I am concerned that they won't for much longer.  I would suggest backing them up immediately.

The extra content on the discs was a nice surprise, but I have to knock off one star in the rating for the discs overall condition.",1437091200,5,854,4.923076923076923

3122435,5,B00144PA06,"Absolutely wonderful and ageless TV series. I fell in love with the series when it was first broadcast in India on cable network channel Star Plus (which used to show only English TV series then) in the early 90s along with Knight Rider and Manimal. Even though I was just 6 years old and had just started learning English at the primary school, I could more or less understand what was going on in that particular episode of Remington Steele. Not being able to see the entire series then, it was like an unfulfilled desire for me to watch the series completely. Now having completed my studies and becoming a professional, I started my search to view the series via any means possible. The Internet definitely helped with only one website hosting it for free. So, I was still dependant on the Internet for watching my most favourite TV series and unfortunately DVDs of this TV series are still not available for sale in the DVD region that includes India. But I profusely thank Amazon.com and M & N Media, Georgia, USA for enabling me to own the entire series in DVD format, especially M & N Media since they are the only store on Amazon selling this TV series brand new and even to international customers like me. Others were selling it either second hand or just within USA. So, do buy this TV series as it will never be a waste of your time or money.

Just listen to the commentaries. Michael Gleason & Robert Butler's production & writing team were so dedicated to this project and each other, and it shows. They also had (and have) the utmost praise for the hunger of their acting team. Pierce Brosnan's charm & comedic timing; Stephanie Zimbalist's equally skilled & complimentary acting & athletic abilities are also undeniable. These two were great together. I never tire of looking at Pierce. The only disappointment that I have the slightest twinge over is the lack of development of the two characters; I'm a romantic at heart. But what's done, is done, & like they say what happens to a show when the sexual tension is gone,(what they claim happened to Moonlighting), the appeal, the chemistry dies. I don't agree, but...
NBC was too ignorant & overbearing; they robbed Pierce of his initial chance at Bond, but it's all good, 'cause things turned out for the best, anyway. And by no means last, Doris Roberts was such (& also still is, by way of 5 Grammys) a seasoned, fine actress, a wonderful addition. It's a rarity for a cast and crew to meld so nicely in this business, so for that, a heartfelt thanks to the powers that be for bringing this treat to our living rooms.",1318636800,,1404,4.711382113821138
3122456,5,B00144PA06,"I can honestly say that I've never enjoyed any TV series as much as I did--and do--Remington Steele. I was a James Bond fan long before I ever discovered RS, and after watching a few fan-cast videos of Pierce Brosnan in the role of Remington Steele, the nameless ex-felon and all-around scoundrel, I decided to look the series up on Hulu. I think I finished all 5 seasons in two weeks--yea, it was THAT good!

Stephanie Zimbalist is such a beautiful, talented actress; her character, Laura Holt, runs the Remington Steele Detective Agency. When an unnamed, jewel thief walks into her life and masquerades as the nonexistent Remington Steele, Laura must learn to work alongside a mysterious, dashing man.

Pierce Brosnan, in a role BEFORE James Bond, is an absolutely hilarious, carefree, film lover with a knack for getting into trouble whether it is with the cops, suspects, clients, and even with Laura! You can't help but fall in love with Remington the fist moment he steps on screen--and you'll find yourself going crazy as you wait for Laura and Remington to have a quiet scene together, alone, away from flying bullets and murder attempts!

Mildred Krebs, played by Doris Roberts, is the constant go-between for Laura and Remington; she is the glue that holds not just the Detective Agency but the TV series as well. This is the best role I've seen her in; if you liked her in Everybody Loves Raymond, you just have to see her in Remington Steele!

It doesn't matter who you are, how old you are (I'm 20), or what genera you enjoy, Remington Steele is one of the best shows ever produced. If you've already watched this series and you're looking for a new show, check out Moonlighting with Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis.

3122477,4,B00144PA06,"It is not often that you have the opportunity to watch a favourite series/film of your childhood and realise that it is actually BETTER than you remember. Well - Remington Steele is one of those series. Sometimes the stories could be better. But the photo, the lighting, the clothes and scenery and above all the ACTORS are brilliant. The way Stephanie Zimbalist, Pierce Brosnan and Doris Roberts do physical comedy reminds you of Cary Grant, Kathrine Hepburn and other classical stars. The series actually catches the feeling of classic Hollywood movies in many aspects. And the chemistry between Zimbalist and Brosnan is fantastic - as are the stunts and many 'physical' aspects, like Laura and Remington running in evening dresses - how can plain RUNNING be that fun?

My only reason for giving only four stars is the box. The double side DVD system is not to my liking. It gives a 'cheap' touch to a glamorous series. It also makes it very easy to damage the discs and the extra material is spread all over the discs, which is sad since it is very nice extra material.

I have an European edition of the first season, which is of much higher quality. I will definitely buy the rest of the seasons as they are released in Europe to have a better Remington box. But the series is just great!",1225238400,24,1293,4.6173913043478265

3122479,5,B00144PA06,"I really enjoyed this show when it was originally on TV! It was nice to be able to see it all again on high quality DVD! Some of the included special feature interviews and commentaries touch on the controversy back then, when apparrently the show had already been CANCELLED, but NetWork exersized last minute contractual options to do several special TV Movie episodes over that summer, thus pulling the rug out from under Pierce Brosnan, who's agent reportedly had already negotiated a James Bond deal! (Pierce Brosnan didn't get James Bond role until years later) Stephanie Zimbalist was great it this, her signature role. I was a bit disappointed with plot twist in last few episodes where they have Laura Holt marry Remington Steele in sham marriage to prevent his deportation, & handsome I.N.S. agent assigned to discredit marriage becomes competitive love interest romancing Laura Holt! They perpetuate continueing theme of them never really getting together! (though last scene in final episode hints that they finally do) I have quarrel with quality of DVD DISKs in set I recieved! In 3 or 4 of the disks, there were sections that would not play (picture/sound disintigrated during Doris Roberts Interview,etc) In the last season ONE OF THE DISKS WAS completely MISSING!

3356896,5,B00144PA06,"Remington Steele was a truly stylish television show that tapped into the kind of Stanley Donen light mystery with romance that was missing from the movies. Pierce Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist were perfectly cast and the show only got better with each episode. The evocative Henry Mancini theme music captured the sense of mystery and romance perfectly.

Laura Holt (Zimbalist) couldn't get her private detective agency off the ground in spite of her skills until she invented the phantom agency head, Remington Steele. Business was booming and everything was going swell until Pierce Brosnan showed up and assumed the identity of the nonexistent Steele! Brosnan's Steele was debonair and stylish, his past a shady mystery ala' ""To Catch a Thief.""

Each season Laura discovered new things about his past in Ireland and his exploits in other countries. Steele was a classic film buff and would make constant references to films of the 1930's and 1940's pertaining to the case. It made all us film buffs who knew just what he was talking about feel like we were insiders, and was one of the many charms of this wonderful show.

Brosnan and Zimbalist were a terrific screen couple in the tradition of all those ones we remember fondly. There was a fun anticipation for viewers as week after week we watched the two become involved in a mystery while they danced around their growing affection for each other. And it was always fun as little tidbits of Steele's past were discovered by Laura. Season one had one of the best episodes (Vintage Steele) as the tables were turned and Steele got a glimpse at Laura's past!

The overall quality of the show improved with season two as Doris Roberts was added to the cast as Mildred Krebs, and two other characters were lost. The show became even more fun than before, and both Brosnan and Stephanie Zimbalist settled in for good as everyone's favorite TV couple. The show never looked back after season two began.

Season three's ""Steele Trying"" was perhaps the most representative episode of what Remington Steele was all about. Steele invents a case as a ruse so the two can whisk off for a romantic San Francisco weekend. It all goes awry, of course, when there turns out to be a very real case which interferes with all Steele's plans. Wonderful music and a romantic backdrop add to the fun as Remington and Laura have fun and a little romance along the way as they solve the mystery.

Brosnan and Zimbalist had a wonderful repore and viewers fell in love with Michael Gleason's show from the start. Both leads had a flair for comedy which was mingled with the romance and mystery, making for sophisticated fun. Doris Roberts added mightily to the feel of the show as she adored the ""Boss"" but loved Laura also. Both Brosnan and Zimbalist became creative forces behind the camera over time but it was Michael Gleason who made and kept the show fun and interesting week after week.

Few shows hold a soft spot in viewer's hearts like Remington Steele. It was romantic mystery and escapism for an hour each week and classic film fans especially loved this show. One of the best shows ever on television as pure entertainment. A must have for fans.",1213574400,62,3192,4.76130198915009

The cases for each season were packaged together into a single package, but it's clear that each season disc package was handled individually at some point in the past.  And when they were, they appear to have been terribly ""squashed"".  Since each package contains four double-sided discs, the discs at the ends rubbed against the packaging.  So, they are not technically scratched, but they are certainly marked.

Furthermore, I'm not sure how long the discs are going to last.  They show signs of delamination, and while they all read cleanly, I am concerned that they won't for much longer.  I would suggest backing them up immediately.

I fell in love with the series when it was first broadcast in India on cable network channel Star Plus (which used to show only English TV series then) in the early 90s along with Knight Rider and Manimal. Even though I was just 6 years old and had just started learning English at the primary school, I could more or less understand what was going on in that particular episode of Remington Steele. Not being able to see the entire series then, it was like an unfulfilled desire for me to watch the series completely. Now having completed my studies and becoming a professional, I started my search to view the series via any means possible. The Internet definitely helped with only one website hosting it for free. So, I was still dependant on the Internet for watching my most favourite TV series and unfortunately DVDs of this TV series are still not available for sale in the DVD region that includes India. But I profusely thank Amazon.com and M & N Media, Georgia, USA for enabling me to own the entire series in DVD format, especially M & N Media since they are the only store on Amazon selling this TV series brand new and even to international customers like me. Others were selling it either second hand or just within USA. So, do buy this TV series as it will never be a waste of your time or money.

3356952,5,B00144PA06,"The entire run of Remington Steele....*sigh*. If you were (then probably you still are) a fan of this show, then you already know the depth of respect between all involved. Just listen to the commentaries. Michael Gleason & Robert Butler's production & writing team were so dedicated to this project and each other, and it shows. They also had (and have) the utmost praise for the hunger of their acting team. Pierce Brosnan's charm & comedic timing; Stephanie Zimbalist's equally skilled & complimentary acting & athletic abilities are also undeniable. These two were great together. I never tire of looking at Pierce. The only disappointment that I have the slightest twinge over is the lack of development of the two characters; I'm a romantic at heart. But what's done, is done, & like they say what happens to a show when the sexual tension is gone,(what they claim happened to Moonlighting), the appeal, the chemistry dies. I don't agree, but...
NBC was too ignorant & overbearing; they robbed Pierce of his initial chance at Bond, but it's all good, 'cause things turned out for the best, anyway. And by no means last, Doris Roberts was such (& also still is, by way of 5 Grammys) a seasoned, fine actress, a wonderful addition. It's a rarity for a cast and crew to meld so nicely in this business, so for that, a heartfelt thanks to the powers that be for bringing this treat to our living rooms.",1318636800,,1404,4.711382113821138
3356953,5,B00144PA06,"I can honestly say that I've never enjoyed any TV series as much as I did--and do--Remington Steele. I was a James Bond fan long before I ever discovered RS, and after watching a few fan-cast videos of Pierce Brosnan in the role of Remington Steele, the nameless ex-felon and all-around scoundrel, I decided to look the series up on Hulu. I think I finished all 5 seasons in two weeks--yea, it was THAT good!

Stephanie Zimbalist is such a beautiful, talented actress; her character, Laura Holt, runs the Remington Steele Detective Agency. When an unnamed, jewel thief walks into her life and masquerades as the nonexistent Remington Steele, Laura must learn to work alongside a mysterious, dashing man.

Pierce Brosnan, in a role BEFORE James Bond, is an absolutely hilarious, carefree, film lover with a knack for getting into trouble whether it is with the cops, suspects, clients, and even with Laura! You can't help but fall in love with Remington the fist moment he steps on screen--and you'll find yourself going crazy as you wait for Laura and Remington to have a quiet scene together, alone, away from flying bullets and murder attempts!

Mildred Krebs, played by Doris Roberts, is the constant go-between for Laura and Remington; she is the glue that holds not just the Detective Agency but the TV series as well. This is the best role I've seen her in; if you liked her in Everybody Loves Raymond, you just have to see her in Remington Steele!

It doesn't matter who you are, how old you are (I'm 20), or what genera you enjoy, Remington Steele is one of the best shows ever produced. If you've already watched this series and you're looking for a new show, check out Moonlighting with Cybill Shepherd and Bruce Willis.

Well - Remington Steele is one of those series. Sometimes the stories could be better. But the photo, the lighting, the clothes and scenery and above all the ACTORS are brilliant. The way Stephanie Zimbalist, Pierce Brosnan and Doris Roberts do physical comedy reminds you of Cary Grant, Kathrine Hepburn and other classical stars. The series actually catches the feeling of classic Hollywood movies in many aspects. And the chemistry between Zimbalist and Brosnan is fantastic - as are the stunts and many 'physical' aspects, like Laura and Remington running in evening dresses - how can plain RUNNING be that fun?

My only reason for giving only four stars is the box. The double side DVD system is not to my liking. It gives a 'cheap' touch to a glamorous series. It also makes it very easy to damage the discs and the extra material is spread all over the discs, which is sad since it is very nice extra material.

(Pierce Brosnan didn't get James Bond role until years later) Stephanie Zimbalist was great it this, her signature role. I was a bit disappointed with plot twist in last few episodes where they have Laura Holt marry Remington Steele in sham marriage to prevent his deportation, & handsome I.N.S. agent assigned to discredit marriage becomes competitive love interest romancing Laura Holt!

8254300,5,B00144PA06,"It's 2016 and I'm writing a review on Remington Steele.  I can't help it though, this show is so awesome!  I wasn't old enough to catch its original run so I watched it in syndication and now I remember I loved it so much then I eagerly watched its entire run (I have ADD so it's very hard for me to stick with any show the whole way through).  Fast forward to now and I found the show on Hulu and got sucked back in.  It's hilarious (laugh out loud funny at times), it's romantic, it's so much fun.  It's what Castle tried to do but failed miserably in my opinion.  The minor nitpick I have about the show is the mysteries are somewhat predictable but it's still very well written.  The last season isn't as great (and I really dislike Mildred) but still, it's so much better than any classic detective show ever on tv including Charlie's Angels.

I must say though the real highlight of the series is a pre-James Bond Pierce Brosnan.  I've always been indifferent to Pierce Brosnan - I've seen him in some movies but can't call myself a fan.  I don't dislike him, he's just, well, there (I liked him in Dante's Peak, have never liked the Bond movies and of course hated him in Mrs. Doubtfire but you're supposed to hate him in that).  But this is in my opinion his signature and best role (yes, really).  He was very young then too - I think this might have been his first major acting job.  But he's completely adorable, sweet, funny, sexy and charming as the conman thief with a heart of gold trying to woo his beautiful partner (Stephanie Zimbalist is pretty great too).  He makes a stereotypical character unstereotypical (and his eventual backstory is so sad, it's genuinely heart-tugging).  He's a total delight and he should've gotten some awards for this role.  I can't wait to get my DVDs and rewatch this show as many times as I like.  It's a huge shame it's out of print now and so hard to find.",1482278400,,1908,4.375
