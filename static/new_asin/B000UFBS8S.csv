8469138,5,B000UFBS8S,"'Trijntje' seems impossible to speak (say 'Train-cha'), but her voice, her band, and her repertoire are impossible not to like. When this DVD was produced -- about 10 years ago -- Trijntje had already been a major pop star in Holland for years, and a couple of tunes are in her native language, but overall, there are no disappointments. For a preview, search her name and 'Fields of Gold' or 'So Amazing' on YouTube.",1465776000,3,417,4.648648648648648
