8090405,4,B000BP350Q,"Once upon a time, there was Australia, where prostitution and gambling were not officially legalized major industries in Melbourne, there were enough jobs outside these industries in other fields of activities for Anglo-Saxons-Celts at least, and there were enough newcomers from other places than England for a dirty low paid existence.

This good old time between WWI and WWII has been depicted with a DVD extract of TV show ""My brother Jack"", at the time a revolutionary tale of ordinary people's family, not a usual Australian story of British adventurers, pirates or simply bandits -- Kelly or other no-ideology-attached criminals.

And this work very much differs from usual Australian top-movies, where stupidity and sexuality rule (Bad Boy Bubby, Strange Bed Fellows for instance), among which recent ""Ten Canoes"" a welcome sound exemption is.

I will not place this DVD on my shelf, but it is definitely of curiosity for trying understand roots of contemporary Australia.",1165536000,,980,5.309677419354839
