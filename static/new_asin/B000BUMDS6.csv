8092942,5,B000BUMDS6,I love this movie and I remember watching it on VHS as a rental from a video rental store. The movie has a Romeo and Juliet feel to it and it uses the nationality of the characters instead of the rich or poor theme. The acting in was great and the story was rich as well as being seen in each scene of the whole movie.,1405728000,,318,3.8333333333333335

This show is exactly a perfect example of the blooding murdering Italian-Sino gangster-fighting to dominate extortion from/""protection of"" the local NYC Downtown businesses.

Beautiful girl and a very handsome sexually advanced baby-looking block of a misunderstandable age are really nice in a particular act of more-to-imagine-than-shown.

This movie is the most interesting to enjoying sexy-looking young men testosterone-fuelled fights and shooting on the dirty streets of a seemingly American New York-location.

Really, ""Make Love-Not War!"" is the best short description deployable in this case.",1189900800,2,906,5.946153846153846
