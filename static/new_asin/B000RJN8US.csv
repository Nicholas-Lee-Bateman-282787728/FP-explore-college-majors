8595217,5,B000RJN8US,This movie is very fascinating. One certainly should watch this movie atleast once in a day to keep reminding the fundamental elements that drives onself and the surroundings to the safe net. I don't think there is a product that would reveal the fundamental elments that would be a win-win situation for the present and future for the nations and its people. I really look forward for more movies like this movie to educate myself from the author of this movie.,1183680000,,462,4.716049382716049
