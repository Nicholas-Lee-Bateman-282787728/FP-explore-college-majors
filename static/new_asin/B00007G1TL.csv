1808796,3,B00007G1TL,"Kirk Douglas is a real actor considering the crap we get these days that dont
like to get dirty and please not too physical...they might break a nail.
  So old movies are not as thrilling as today's special effect movies...but old
movies had something special....real actors ...who actually had to work for a living.
Anyway, in this film we have Kirk as a bad guy, good with his twisted tongue to
keep his workers interested in the big money comming from chopping down the
biggest trees which reside on land that have a Religious bunch living on it.
So who gets the trees....Kirk...the religious community..or others who wants in.
I guess you will have to watch this film to know the ending.
  I would like to mention that the choosen music for the first portion of the film
is very good...i was so surprised......ahhh old films.....get better with age...",1259884800,,855,4.718120805369128
1808797,5,B00007G1TL,Kirk Douglas works with wood and wants to make money quick by grabbing land in California and cutting the giant and very old trees. He ends up getting involved with religious people who live there and only want him to cut the newer and smaller trees. Patrice Wymore is the woman who is in love with him but he starts falling for the religious Eve Miller. The unusual and interesting scenery makes this western worth seeing. Also Douglas here is at his best.,1232496000,,457,4.518072289156627
1808798,4,B00007G1TL,"CONTAINS SPOILERS

  ""The Big Trees"" is a western mystery starring Kirk Douglas and Edgar Buchanan. It concerns conflicts between two warring factions: the environmentalists and the conservationsist profiteers. Kirk Douglas plays a mine leader who's objective is to make use of California's Redwood Trees for his company's profits. A Quaker group attempts to prevent these trees from being destroyed. That is the conflict for half of the movie. However, problems start to get far more complex as the film moves on. The conflicts erupts into full scale when an innocent priest is crushed to death by a falling redwood. Then, members of Kirk Douglas' rival company gun down and murder his pal ""Lucky"" (Edgar Buchanan) in cold blood. He then ponders over changing his greedy ways. He also battles the bad guys in a climactic showdown and emerges a victorious and reformed man. Overall an action packed and enjoyable film.

  It has already been said by another reviewer that there are six DVD versions of the film available. I purchased the Vina Distributor $1.99 disc and found the quality to be adequate. However, I have heard that the Roan Group edition DVD ($14.99) quality is far from impressive. There is no point in spending a fortune on a DVD that is expensive and bad quality. I highly recommend that you search for the inexpensive Vina edition and buy that. Happy viewing!",1118793600,3,1379,4.9480519480519485
1808799,3,B00007G1TL,"THE BIG TREES starts out with a great deal of promise - Kirk Douglas stars as Jim Fallon, a Wisconsin timber baron who plans to take advantage of a new law that will allow him to `harvest' California's giant sequoias and make a fortune in the process.
 The movie opens in Wisconsin where Fallon is facing down a growling work crew.  The pay is late, again, and the men have just about had it.  Drawing on his deep well of nerve and blarney and charm, as well as a well-timed gunshot from soon-to-be sidekick `Yukon' Burns (Edgar Buchanan), Fallon not only avoids a bloody mutiny but he even manages to talk the crew into migrating to California where, seemingly, money does indeed grow on trees.
  So far so good.  THE BIG TREES might be a cut above.  The first scene in California (the movie was filmed in Orlick) has Fallon and Yukon measuring the diameter of a giant redwood.  It measures out at twenty-eight feet, and the scene is only slightly jarred by the shadow of the camera and boom during this attractive tracking shot.
  The hitch in Fallon's plans take the form of Friends, or Quakers, who regard the ancient redwoods as sacred objects.  They hold their religious services outdoors, nestled in this majestic sequoia cathedral.  Nestled in the bosom of the Quaker community is the beautiful Alicia Chadwick (Eve Miller) (the dvd biography on Miller tells us she was a Playmate of the Month a couple years after THE BIG TREES was released.)
 Love trumps Greed and, the last time I looked, Beauty is batting 1.000 against the Beast.  Fallon doesn't stand a chance, but before this movie loses all momentum and devolves into a group tree-hug a second group of lumber hungry sociopaths make their presence felt.
 It's about then that THE BIG TREES took a big turn and morphed into a Starched Shirt western.  Characters chop down trees and wrestle the bad guy on a shaky rope bridge spanning a deep gorge and then show up in the next scene in a spotlessly clean starched shirt.  The last half of this movie is corny and formulaic, and betrays the promising start.
  Still and all THE BIG TREES is entertaining, well-acted, and good looking.",1085961600,15,2147,4.647214854111406

1808874,4,B00007G1TL,"Movie has a natural pace that leaves the big city for the Northern California woods of the early 1900's, as callous industrialist Kirk Douglas invades homesteads to rob settlers of the trees that, in one case, they literally worship. A beautiful woman softens his heart but the bad guys move in, chopping down everything in their path including trees that were alive when Jesus walked the Earth. Then its up to Kirk to ride the wild runaway logging train to save the girl and day while trestles are exploded out from under them and an entire colony of pacifists take up arms to help. Pretty good show, a rousing finale, and the restoration gives it a fresh glow.  Edgar Buchanan was the most fun to watch as the kindly ""advance man"" who realizes nothing will stop the trademark aggressiveness of log king Kirk except a well deserved sock in the mouth.

By the way, the film is way better than the lame illustration used to promote it here on Amazon. Well worth a viewing.",1448323200,,971,4.574712643678161

The reason I wanted it was because Dewey Martin also starred in it. Dewey was once married to Peggy Lee. He was in a few movies but never a big known actor. I saw the movie on TCM. They had to use scenes from various sources and the sound was bad. So, it was on Amazon on VHS and I found it and bought it. Now there is a DVD also on Amazon, from Germany..or Italy. I bought it as the soundtrack can also be played in English. So far it hasn't arrived. I was going to transfer the VHS copy to DVD but so far I haven't. Happy 90th Dewey.

1808922,5,B00007G1TL,"This 1952 B&W ,89 minute movie is typical of the flood of westerns we got from Hollywood. All the great actors were in them along with many other lead and supporting actors. I remember this period when I was in High School. I lived in a small town of 5000,and we had 2 theatres. Each theatre played 3 different movies a week. Without exception,Monday and Tuesday were love movies,Wednesday and Thursdays were war stories,horror ,etc., and Friday and Saturday were Westerns. Before the main feature there were the ""shorts"" which include ,World News,and a ""cartoon"" such as The Three Stooges,or a serial such as Superman .There was a matinee at 3:30 pm,and two showings in the evening at 7pm. & 9Pm

 There is still a Western or two produced these days ,but they are not what we used to get. Nowadays we get a lot of ballyhoo and buildup and the movies are real letdowns. Brokeback Mountain simply wasn't worth the time and well,The Lone Ranger was a flop. So what's a person to do who wants to watch a ""good western""? Simple, dig up one of the oldies.
 Big Trees features Douglas as a con-man,who takes a gang of lumbermen from Wisconsin to California to make millions chopping down the big Redwoods. He tries to use legal loopholes to push a settlement of Quakers aside and get at the valuable timber. There are several real interesting and well developed characters,none any less so than a beautiful Quaker who smittens the con man and turns him around. There is lots of action and a great runway log train ,trestel explosion and wreck.
 A great entertaining hour and a half from a period when Hollywood could and did make good Westerns.",1380067200,,1638,4.637931034482759

7976054,4,B00007G1TL,"RELEASED IN 1952 and directed by Felix Feist, ""The Big Trees"" stars Kirk Douglas as a conniving lumber baron, Jim Fallon, who schemes to make it rich in Northern California in 1900 when a new law means large tracks of land are up for grabs to whoever can pay the fees. He plans to cut down the mighty redwoods but a colony of homesteading Quaker-like Christians are unwavering in their resolve to save the largest of the sacred trees, which are the ones Fallon wants most. Edgar Buchanan plays Fallons sidekick-turned-marshal in the Redwoods, Walter ""Yukon Lucky"" Burns.

This was a remake of Warner Brother's ""Valley of the Giants"" from fifteen years earlier. While Douglas worked for free to get out of his WB contract it doesnt seem like it, as he has his usual gusto. The old-fashioned tone will likely turn off modern viewers but the environmental message was certainly ahead of its time. The story lacks drive, however, due to the convoluted dialog about legalities & finance; it's as though you need a doctorate on California land law in order to follow whats happening.

Fallon (Douglas) naturally becomes smitten by religious beauty Alicia Chadwick (Eve Miller) while having dubious links to blonde showgirl Dora ""Daisy Fisher"" Figg (Patrice Wymore). Speaking of whom, jaw-dropping Wymore has a memorable song & dance sequence thats worth the price of admission, particularly when she, um, never mind.

There are several other highlights, like a scene that shows how ancient the redwoods are (e.g. they were fully grown when William the Conqueror invaded England in 1066). Furthermore, there are fistfights, a falling tree that crushes a cabin, a dynamited dam, a thrilling runaway train sequence, a huge trestle that collapses under the train, a sacrificial death and a good moral(s).

I should add that the script perpetuates the myth that The Lord helps those who help themselves comes from the Bible. While a worthy proverb, its not Scripture.

Watch out for Alan Hale Jr. (the Skipper from Gilligans Island) playing Tiny.

THE MOVIE RUNS 1 hour 29 minutes and was shot in Redwood Groves, Orick and Eureka, California. WRITERS: John Twist and James R. Webb wrote the screenplay from Kenneth Earls novel.
