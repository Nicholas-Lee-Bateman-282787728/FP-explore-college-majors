8089045,5,B000BML556,"Rock Theater as they called it, was the Legendary Bloodgood (who recently changed guitarist) who did a visually & musically mesmerizing passion play. It was the 2nd part to Alive In America which was like a street drama. This one is a different set of songs, mostly from Detonation. I got it recently used for the collection. It's as powerfull now as it was then. In 1990 it was released as both a VHS and audio album.",1361750400,,418,4.441558441558442
