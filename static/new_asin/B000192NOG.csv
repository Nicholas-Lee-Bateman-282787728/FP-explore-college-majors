When it was over, I couldn't help myself from telling several friends about it over the next few days.  Hmmm... Maybe I should have given it four stars?",1348012800,,314,4.271186440677966
8008579,3,B000192NOG,"Well, I just got finished watching this movie. Let me be the first in saying, if you're looking for a movie with a plot, look elsewhere. Although there were no twist or turns, I found the movie to be a bit, well, confusing. There really isn't anything that pulls you into these characters. Bradford Tatum did very well and I love some of the things that he had said (he wrote and co-directed the film) and they were very insightful. But some of the other actors were, I'm sorry, absolutely embarrassing. Espeically the black man who was trying so desperately to be gay that he thought by constantly putting his hand to his chest meant gay. If thats the case, every woman when she sees a spider is gay. Anyway, all in all, I liked this movie enough to maybe rent it. Kinda' sorry I bought it. Now I don't know what to do with it. I'll probably hang on to it just to watch Tatum. I'm surprised he isn't in more movies.

Bottom Line::: OK rental. If you're into art (especially sculpting) get it. You'll definetely get something out of it.",1115251200,4,1036,4.395833333333333
