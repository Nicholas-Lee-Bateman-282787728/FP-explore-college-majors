7093165,5,B00VKTWWIS,"Professional stretch workout, great instruction, beautiful results. Great Price on Amazon, as always.",1434672000,4,101,6.846153846153846
7093166,5,B00VKTWWIS,"These ladies both know how to deliver. They never
cease to exceed my expectations.
This dvd is now one of my top favorites, and I have them all!
Can't wait to see what they produce next!",1432944000,5,186,4.194444444444445
7093167,3,B00VKTWWIS,"I have used several of the Esmonde-White dvds. And I have read Aging Backwards. In general she seldom tells you how to modify an exercise, she is more into teaching you about your muscles. Having a bad knee and stiff hip, sometimes I just don't know where to go. Rather than telling you to ""work more softly"" or at 10%, showing adaptations would be mighty nice, say using two people in a dvd. However, what they do works, and I love their short youtube videos so much I have asked why they are not on dvd. This particular video has NO WARMUP and is best done, say after a walk. They tell me this is their gentlest dvd, but I find the back pain relief one much more useful.",1431993600,77,672,4.217054263565892
7093168,5,B00VKTWWIS,"Very helpful with stiffness and mobility issues, short routines for specific problems, as well as longer routines.",1429142400,13,114,5.764705882352941
7093169,5,B00VKTWWIS,Great!,1491091200,,6,6.0
7093170,5,B00VKTWWIS,"I really enjoy the workouts and feel so stretched when the workouts are completed.  What I appreciate is that it is not based on cardio workouts, but really working with the muscles and joints in a disciplined way.  In much the same manner a classical ballet dancer would stretch.  The music is perfect, following the verbal instructions is easy, following the instructor is easy and you have a great sense of grace and improved overall posture when you have finished the workout.  I think EVERYONE should be working out with Essentrics.  I wish there were classes nearby!!!",1489968000,11,574,4.876288659793815
7093171,5,B00VKTWWIS,"Well done, thorough movement program that's easy to follow, articulated well and left me ""feeling it"" which is always a good thing.  Not an easy routine for an active 68 yr. old but definitely not difficult.  Leaves me with energy and a glow! I would highly recommend this workout for any age. Each day becomes easier so once you get the hang of the movements you begin to flow.",1485734400,18,378,4.463768115942029
7093172,3,B00VKTWWIS,Good packiging,1483747200,,14,6.5
7093173,3,B00VKTWWIS,was too expensive for the instruction made available.,1477008000,2,53,5.75
7093174,2,B00VKTWWIS,I can't really use this DVD as my knees are weak and many of the exercises put too much pressure on them.,1474070400,4,105,3.8181818181818183

7093176,5,B00VKTWWIS,This DVD has 6 different target area . I have improved my flexibility and posture following  this program,1470614400,10,105,4.833333333333333
7093177,3,B00VKTWWIS,Its ok.  Too expensive for the value.,1468800000,,37,4.285714285714286
7093178,4,B00VKTWWIS,"Really, really like the 15 min segments (four in all) and the instructor who leads these segments.  She constantly reminds you to relax, not bring yourself to a point of pain, which I think is so important when intending to follow someone in exercises whether in a video or a class.  She has her mind on her audience even though you are no where near and the stretches and movements are excellent.",1462060800,5,397,4.5
7093179,5,B00VKTWWIS,I have been exercising for over 60 years and this (plus the other Miranda dvds) is the best thing out there.,1456876800,3,108,4.190476190476191
7093180,5,B00VKTWWIS,"This is one of my favorite workout dvds. I love the combination of barre work and stretching.
The only props you'll need is a standard kitchen chair with a high back.(substitute for a barre)

During the week I do a lot of variety of exercising including treadmill and weight lifting and this is the only tape that was able
to unlock my super tight hamstrings.

The pace is fairly fast, but I found that after a few run throughs, your muscle memory kicks in and you pick up on her pace
I'm a beginner level with most workout dvd's and had no problems with this one.

Warning-Essentrics tapes do not give modifications so you should preview before purchasing.",1454198400,8,657,4.5508474576271185
7093181,5,B00VKTWWIS,Really good stretching and bending workout.,1453161600,,43,6.333333333333333
7093182,4,B00VKTWWIS,"I bought this set from Miranda's website Essentrics. This comes as a two dvd set. The first dvd is taught by her daughter Sahra Esmonde-White; she teaches the longer 30 minute workouts. Sahra's dvd has two workouts. The second dvd is taught by Miranda and it has the four mini workouts. According to the Essentrics website, this would be ideal for beginners. I hesitate to recommend this set for absolute beginners. Miranda's exercises are gentle up to a point. Some of the exercises, she demonstrates, require unusual positions that may hurt a inexperienced exerciser. Case in point, she uses c-curve position on the spine and this may not be ideal for anyone with back issues. She demonstrates this particular position while working on the iliopsas. It would not be a problem for an experienced exerciser. As far as her shoulder exercises are concerned, there is a lot of range of movement exercises that maybe difficult for anyone with shoulder pain. This is good dvd for someone who is a experienced exerciser who needs to add flexibility training to their regimen. It is excellent for loosening tight muscles. Miranda's program uses mainly active stretch sequence. Despite it being labeled a stretch workout, this is not a static stretching program. Both these ladies are extremely flexible and some of the movement they demonstrate might be a little too much for someone who is just starting out.",1452988800,34,1402,4.995726495726496
7093183,5,B00VKTWWIS,"This is incredible.  Combing the best of all workouts out there -- from yoga to Pilates.  This is infinitely better than walking.  This actually supports and strengthens your spine- crucial to keeping healthy posture.  Walking alone does NOT strengthen the spine.  Spend your time on this gem of a work out.  If you've seen the PBS program, you will very pleased!!",1452124800,32,364,4.885245901639344
7093184,5,B00VKTWWIS,"My joints were so stiff and especially my hips. Once I began doing the progrsm in this book, I decided to get o
the beginners  DVD. After a month, I feel the difference.  I am mid 60s so I know aching joints. If you stay with the program, it we ill help",1446336000,20,253,3.8461538461538463
7093185,5,B00VKTWWIS,Very easy 15 minute stretches.  I do notice a difference in posture and I have less knots in my shoulders.  I have a desk job and tend to hurt more on my right side from having my arm out to use the mouse.  I also tend to get tight at the hip joints which then leads to mid and upper back and neck pain.  Just doing these stretches helps to relax my muscles and I have had less headaches and body aches/knots since I have been doing the exercises.  Seems to work best if I do them every day to every other day.  Once a week was not as effective :-),1445558400,31,548,3.891891891891892
7093186,2,B00VKTWWIS,I was expecting more from what I had heard about Esmonde-White...and they are much too expensive for what you get.,1444694400,2,114,4.75

7093189,4,B00VKTWWIS,These are good work outs but not as easy as they make them look.  I plan to continue doing them and hoping it will eventually get as easy for me as it is for them.,1441756800,4,163,3.657142857142857
7093190,5,B00VKTWWIS,Great ideas here!,1440633600,,17,5.0
7093191,4,B00VKTWWIS,I haven't used this yet but bought becasue a friend has been using her for years and says she is the best and her strength is much improved by these exercises.,1439683200,,159,4.161290322580645
7093192,3,B00VKTWWIS,my experience with the seller was flawless but less than thrilled with the video. You can get as much instruction from their little clips on the essentrics website and on youtube,1438214400,12,178,4.774193548387097

7093194,1,B00VKTWWIS,"This is not for people seeking relief back or hip pain which the promotional material targets. It is rather for young, highly flexible, and supple people who don't need it. The instructor is a young 20 something girl going through contortionist stretches at an accelerated fast-paced clip with no pauses and few repeats. This needs a gentle lead-in. Too aggressive for the average mature person.",1437868800,14,395,5.092307692307692

7093197,5,B00VKTWWIS,Awesome. It is a great workout.,1436572800,,31,4.333333333333333
7093198,1,B00VKTWWIS,"not very happy with this. it would have helped to verbalize the targeted muscle (group) each movement was targeting. more reps, so that a person could get the feeling of doing it correctly. this dvd is okay, if you're warming up a trained ballet dancer. maybe extending the length of the dvd would have been better; I could actually feel that THEY were aware of the time. some are teachers, some are not. I have always been an active person, so I'm no stranger to body awareness. the mother is the pro. The daughter would do well to remember that she IS teaching. maybe these dvds are for those who own the previous 85! thumbs down. i will look into a refund.",1436140800,25,659,4.409836065573771

8710443,5,B00VKTWWIS,"I bought the video after watching the show on TV several times.  I appreciated the fact that M. Esmond-White developed it through study of kinesiology, and is not using it as a vehicle for some trendy spirituality.
I have found the exercises very helpful for improving flexibility, relieving the old aches and pains, increasing circulation through movement, some strengthening.
It worked as well as yoga exercises, without the inclusion of a religious practice which I can not accept.",1527379200,,484,5.205128205128205
8710444,5,B00VKTWWIS,Ordered this after seeing it on PBS. What a difference it is making in my life to know how to stretch properly.,1517788800,,111,4.090909090909091
8710445,5,B00VKTWWIS,"The comments by other verified buyers, are all true.
Yes, this is a costly DVD in comparison to others in the market. But I differ in value. As one who has done workouts via book, video and now DVD--I recognize that the cost of a workout sometimes is worth the cost. If I consider what I'd have to do if I did NOT do these (see pain management doctors, clinics, and heaven only knows what else)--then the cost of these is less than a class a day a week. Even in Western Mass.
Yes, Miranda sometimes (though less often as she's aged) and more often, Sahra (her daughter)--do not offer alternative poses for some of the trickier poses. Especially those involving knees.
So the responsibility for making these edits lands on the person working out. For the record, Miranda does often offer alternatives for especially tricky joints.
SO why would I buy this too? Because at this point, I find Essentrics to be one of the best ways to keep myself limber enough (I've scoliosis and a knee, soas and hips that stiffen if I don't). Miranda's 15-min. fixes were wonderful, especially for days I don't have much time for a full workout. And I've learned that part of a DVD that is fabulous for me--beats a DVD that I hate, or is not good for me.
So that is why I gave it 5 stars. Parts are that. And why I bought it after taking the library copy for a spin.",1514160000,2,1347,4.349206349206349
8710446,5,B00VKTWWIS,This is saving my back and body. I had a bad back issue and within a few minutes of the pain relief CD I was able to release the pain and begin working on a lifetime of better stretching and strengthening. I spent hundreds of dollars with a chiropractor and physical therapist and this fixed the source of the problem so fast I was amazed. I don't know why PTs aren't using this in their offices it is so wonderful.,1511049600,3,415,4.2
