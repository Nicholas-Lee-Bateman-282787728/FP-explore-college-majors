You will suspect nearly everyone of being the murderer at some point.  Highly intriguing and entertaining!",1157155200,2,249,4.744186046511628

I watched this movie without reading the 1950 Dame Agatha Christie novel that it was based on.  (Christie wrote twelve Miss Marple murder mysteries altogether.)  I'm glad I did this!  Why?  Because it forced me to really watch the movie in order to try and deduce who the murderer was.

The movie begins with a mysterious announcement in the local newspaper:

""A murder is announced and will take place on Friday, October 5 at Little Paddocks at 7 P.M.  Friends, please accept this the only intimation.""

""Little Paddocks"" is a small estate in the village of ""Chipping Cleghorn.""  The people of the estate think this announcement is a joke.  But sure enough a murder (or was it a suicide or even an accident?) does take place here at the specified day and time.

Miss Marple (the late Joan Hickson) happens to be in this village on this day.  Inspector Craddock (John Castle) investigates the murder with Miss Marple aiding him.  Eventually, two more murders occur.

Who are the people associated with this estate?  They are as follows:

(1) Miss Lettie Blacklock, owner of the estate (Ursula Howells)
(2) Miss Dora ""Bunny"" Bunner, Lettie's high school friend and companion (Renee Asherton)
(3) Julia Simmons, Lettie's distant cousin (Samantha Bond)
(4) Patrick Simmons , another of Lettie's distant cousins (Simon Shepherd)
(5) Phillipa Haymes, a border at the estate (Nicola King)
(6) Hannah, Lettie's maid (Elaine Ives-Cameron)
(7) Colonel Easterbrook, Lettie's friend (Ralph Michael)
(8) Mrs. Easterbrook, the colonel's wife (Sylvia Syms)
(9) Mrs. Swettenham, Lettie's friend (Mary Kerridge)
(10) Edmund Swettenham, Mrs. Swettenham's son (Matt Solon)
(11) Miss Murgatroyd, Lettie's friend (Joan Sims)
(12) Miss Hinchcliffe, Murgatroyd's companion (Paola Dionisotti)
(13) Mrs. Harron, the vicar's wife and Lettie's friend (Viv Moore)
(14) Rudi Scherz, a petty thief (Tim Carrington)

Joan Hickson (whom Agatha Christie herself wanted to play Miss Marple) captures the essence of the heroine super sleuth in her performance.  (Hickson was 79 years old in this movie!)  All performances in this movie are good but special mention should go to John Castle as the inspector who carries the bulk of this movie.

The cinematography is visually stunning.  All costumes are authentic looking.  Also, the background music adds to each scene.

Finally, be aware that Miss Marple only appears for about one minute in the first hour of this movie.  After this, we see her more often.

In conclusion, this is a fun movie even if you have read the novel it's based on!!

311833,5,6301072642,"There is something really special about this movie.  While it is a worthy mystery, the characters and the sense of humor expressed in the movie were a wonderfully entertaining combination.  The funniest characters were Miss Hinchcliffe and Murgatroyd, the oddest and most endearing couple I've seen on film in a long time.  I was really impressed with this adaptation, and of couse Miss Marple was perfection.  I would definitely recommend this movie to any Christie fans.",1045267200,8,472,5.171052631578948
311834,5,6301072642,"One of a series of Agatha Christie's mystery novels brought to the screen, this one is my personal favorite of the lot. Although all of these productions are first-rate entertainment, ""A Murder is  Announced,"" is perhaps the most successful and inspired. First, the  dialogue in the screenplay is far more interesting than in Christie's  novel, really bringing a wide variety of eccentric British characters to  life. Secondly, the performances of this ensemble cast are alive with the  spirit of the whole enterprise. There is a tremendous range of types in  this motley group, each one memorable and enchanting in his or her own way.  There is a wonderful view of the UK itself which greatly enhances the  context in which the story takes place, and a wonderful sense of the period  following World War II. These charcters seem to do more than just move the  mysterious plot to its' somewhat predictable conclusion. I would say that  watching this video more than once or twice rewards the viewer with a true  sense of the times in which all of the action takes place. At some point it  stops being about the murder and much more about the British temperment and  how it was affected by the War. One sees in this film the passing of  British country life, a certain loss of innocence and a hardening of the  British spirit. It is the end of one time and the beginning of another. The  effect is bittersweet and most touching as it always is when one sees the  end of an era. I have probably seen this one at least 20 times over the  past decade. It's a great document, more a tribute to the makers of the  film than to Agatha Christie. It's a pity she did not have quite the vision  of her interpreters, but as was observed by Gertrude Stein, the first to  come up with a thing usually makes it ugly, leaving it to those who follow  to flesh it out and make it beautiful. This video is a true beauty.",946771200,13,1902,4.481049562682216
311835,4,6301072642,"This adaptation of one of Agatha Christie's most complicated plots is well done, although the video is fuzzy. The whole plot is thrillingly fuzzy, as Joan Hickson, as Miss Marple, finally discovers who is trying to kill Miss  Blacklock.  Particularly good performances by the whole cast and the  suprise ending, typical of a Christie mystery, make this a very rewardable  watch. The English dialogue is sometimes hard to understand, but the  emotions are universal.  Greed, Love, Compassion, Fear....a nice mix in  Chipping Kleghorn, and Miss Marple figures it all out. There are parts of  this mystery that will have you weeping, on the second viewing, or perhaps  the third, when it all makes sense.",918864000,3,701,5.078947368421052

7809626,5,6301072642,"Favorite Agatha Christie adaptation, I think if Christie were alive she would agree. There is only one minor quibble and that is the actor playing Rudy--director should have cut some of the footage on his face. If you have watched this you'll know what I mean.

As for the whole show, it is entirely wonderful; the screenplay, the actors, the mystery itself, the delightful atmosphere of a bygone English countryside and era with its leisurely pace of life. There is so much humor and wit in this adaptation (you really have to pay attention and watch multiple times to enjoy some great lol moments) and some pathos as well. The acting just can't be beat, you feel like you are eavesdropping on the actual life of an English village; almost every character is perfectly and organically realized. Aside from some Sherlock Holmes adaptations this is the best of all mystery shows.",1439596800,,878,4.814569536423841
7809627,5,6301072642,This one kept me wondering what was going to happen from the very beginning to the end. Who was really who in this tightly woven mystery.,1406851200,,137,4.3076923076923075
7809628,5,6301072642,"A man dies in Chipping Kleghorn and suddenly Aunt Jane is coming to stay. As with most Agatha Christie's movies, everybody and nobody could have done it. Miss Jane Marple is the catalyst that helps Inspector Craddock (John Castle) and others to view the situation differently and extrapolate the ""who"" that done it.

It is interesting that the inspector in some movies, is related to Jane and in other movies not. Inspector Craddock here is interesting as he is polite and tolerant of the people he is interrogating.

It is fun to try and match the real names of the actors with the part that they are playing. Would you suspect that Hannah is (Elaine Ives-Cameron)? Or that Miss Hinchcliffe is (Paola Dionisotti)?

Anyway keep your eyes open, as there is not a wasted movement or word in this movie.",1406160000,,800,4.7
7809629,5,6301072642,This movie contains so many wonderful characters that you can watch it over and over again and not tire of it.  Of course Joan Hickson brings Miss Marple to life in that dithering but very deceptively competent way of hers to keep the story just rolling along.  Very delightful watching and I think it will keep you guessing until the very end.,1376352000,,344,4.532258064516129
7809630,4,6301072642,"Not only do I have the movie, I saw it on the BBC network. I liked it. I had no idea who the killer was & was very surprised. I felt sorry for some of the victims. I also liked the way the house was.

It is a great who done it. And Joan Hickson is a great Miss Marple. Miss Marple is one of my favoriter Agatha Christie books. I like all of the actors who have played her. Joan seems to fit her the best. I see her as a little over weight woman who loves to solves crimes  which is just what she is.",1311379200,,499,3.6542056074766354
7809631,5,6301072642,"Never believe an old lady who seems inoffensive and brittle if not endangered. The nicest and fairest mug can hide the worst and sneakiest criminal. But not in the eyes of Miss Marple because she sees with her brain and not with her sole eyes or sole heart. The story is fairly crooked enough to hold you till the end and all along it points at some possible culprits, some of them being pure liars, and yet it is not what you may think. The best liars are always those who do not tell lies, aren't they? But Miss Marple will use her ocular scalpel and dissect these true lies to reveal the lie in the truth like the worm in the fruit. She is a darling old lady but do not try to fool her and in this case one tried and too many others did not realize they were trying. A few rulers will fall on a few knuckles. Fascinatingly  thrilling, though charmingly slow except at the speedy Gonzalez end.
