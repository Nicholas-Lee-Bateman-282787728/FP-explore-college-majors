8224140,5,B000WMFZOM,Pepito showed the way to do the step then his students repeat it slowly and clearly after that Pepito danced with music the Milonga way. It can't be more clear and fun to watch than this.,1329004800,,187,4.222222222222222
8224141,5,B000WMFZOM,"This DVD can have you and your partner doing milonga within a few lessons and a little practice. Well enough produced; though you won't confuse it with MTV.

I highly recommend it, and I am kind of picky about dance instruction tapes.",1214352000,,369,4.75
