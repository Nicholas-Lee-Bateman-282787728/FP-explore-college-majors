8516779,4,B007HOV72M,On the 7th day of Christmas 2014 I'm going to review...MLW Hybird Hell.  The Jerry Lynn-Kid Romeo match was not great but pretty good. The Michael Shane-Homicide match was Solid enough opener but the amount of protection for both guys seemed totally unnecessary for an opening match. The Christopher Daniels-Billy Fives match was also not great but pretty good. The Kenzo Suzuki-Norman Smiley match was so-so at best. The World Tag Team title match between Extreme Horsemen(CW Anderson & Simon Diamond) and the team of Steve Williams/D'Lo Brown was too rushed with a messy finish to boot. The Los Maximos-Samoan Island Tribe tag team was a major league dud. GET IT? The Sabu-Mikey Whipwreck match was WCW in 2000 bad. The CM Punk-Raven match was good even with the run-ins and not as good as thier bouts in Ring of Honor. The World title match between Satoshi Kojima & Mike Awesome was a hardcore smash-mouth brawl even though it was abit sloppy at times. The Impromtu World title match between Mike Awesome & Steve Corino stinks like a 25 year old bag of french fries. The No Rope Barbwire match between Steve Corino & Terry Funk was mostly terrible especially the finish but they worked in a whole load of blood. I give this event a 7 out of 10.,1419033600,,1247,4.668181818181818
8516780,3,B007HOV72M,"The Paul London-Jerry Lynn match while good, the unoriginal finish & weak production hurt this bout. The Fast Eddie-Don Juan-Masada-3 way Texas Wrestling Academy Challenge match was a failure, no matter how hard they tried. The Homicide-Christopher Daniels match while still good, it was not good as their bouts from Ring of Honor. The SAT(Joel & Jose Maximo)-Samoan Island Tribute(Mana & Samu)-Tag Team match was a disaster this side of WCW. The Michael Shane-Norman Smiley match was not bad but not as good as it should have been. The CM Punk-Raven match stinks like a 40 year old cheeseburger. The Fuego Guerrero(Amazing Red)-Ikuto Hidaka match again while not bad, it should have been better. The Mike Awesome-Masato Tanaka match was a hardcore, smash-mouth brawl and a good reminder of their feud in ECW. The Mexican Death Match between Sabu & La Parka was a nightmarish mess. The Steve Corino-Terry Funk match was your average hardcore bout and nothing special. I give this super-card a 5 out of 10.",1417046400,,1005,4.988095238095238
