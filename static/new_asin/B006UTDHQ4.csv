5020284,5,B006UTDHQ4,"This story of the loving relationship and interdependency between the elephant Flora and the owner of Circus Flora will bring you to tears. David Balding eventually chose to free Flora from circus performance, and both paid a heavy emotional price when they were separated.  The film makes a strong case for elephant sensitivity and intelligence, and fosters a quiet respect for a loving animal trainer trying to do the right thing.  It makes a quiet plea for more respect and humane treatment for elephants.  There are strong strong arguments on both sides of the issue of animals in the circus, and insightful explorations of the depth of trauma that elephants in America have experienced.  Flora now thrives in the Elephant Sanctuary in Tennessee.  Mr. Balding died in May, 2014.",1407369600,2,782,5.0310077519379846
5020285,5,B006UTDHQ4,I have done a lot of animal rescue in my life.  This is without a doubt the best film I have ever seen on the problems of putting exotic animals and people together. This is not a film about abuse.  It's a film about Love.  It's about the reality and needs of two species.  It was very carefully done and I'm sure with a great deal of thought.  I think it's a masterpiece!,1393200000,3,372,4.041095890410959
5020286,4,B006UTDHQ4,Sad but well done documentary about finding a permanent home for a circus elephant.  Opens your eyes to the cruel situations these elephants are placed in and how they're wild creatures not just an object of entertainment for people.  But also shows you how strongly they can bond with humans,1390435200,2,292,4.82

5020288,5,B006UTDHQ4,"One Lucky Elephant is a wonderful journey of two ""kindred spirits"" - David Balding and Flora. It reminds me of ""Project Nim"" - amazingly, a mirror image ( a captive elephant this time used in a circus instead of a born in captivity chimpanzee used in a research project ). This docu will touch your heart and foster a thought - a need for a better life for orphaned and captive animals,,,,,hey, the ""best life"" is in the wild with their natural families but if unfortunate to find themselves under our care - we must give them the ""best world"" humanely possible. Did I say humanely? Buy this docu - Flora and David will definitely ""touch you heart"" with their story - one that does not have a Disney-ending.",1338768000,7,707,4.488372093023256
5020289,1,B006UTDHQ4,"So, what exactly is ""lucky"" about being enslaved to be a circus-performer far from ones natural habitat?
At one time the circus-director says ""All the elephant needed was love"". A person would need that. An elephant needs to be an elephant. Please Oprah, be a little more critical and a little less teary eyed.",1336608000,3,310,4.7592592592592595

8504738,2,B006UTDHQ4,Old movie- grainy- about a circus elephant so it was a little sad. Not really for kids.,1463616000,,87,4.176470588235294
8504739,5,B006UTDHQ4,"I saw the documentary twice. Since then I never stop to think about the guy and his elephant flora. I subscribed to the sanctuary in Facebook and getting daily photos and videos. All kind of thoughts coming up in my mind like, did Carol eventually allow him to see his elephant, (it is from if not), I decided to never to see or pay to any circus or entertainment with animals especially not elephants.  I'm torn down of he behavior of this planet populations toward them. I think it is murder and they should be sentenced as if they would kill people. Because a soul before choosing a body, can choose a human being but also could use an elephant body.

Anyway, I think I was in my past life either: 1) an elephant myself or 2) an elephant care giver and devoted my life to them. I'm so emotionally interact to them, plus they are my favorite animals. Giant gentle. They can think, love and socialize like us.",1440633600,4,910,4.378698224852071
