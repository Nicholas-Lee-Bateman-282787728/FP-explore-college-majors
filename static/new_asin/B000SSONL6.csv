8206611,1,B000SSONL6,"I tried watching this movie several times before giving up & cutting it off. For some reason I decided to give it 1 final go. Instead of cutting it off after 20+ minutes, I made it to 40+ minutes & then cut it off. I don't understand why I decided to give it another chance when I should've just left it off in the 1st place. I tried sitting through it but after awhile I just could not do it anymore. I no longer cared about why Julie is being stalked by a bunch of criminals, the stolen diamonds or whatever else happened. All of a sudden it hit me, I could be watching something else. Why am I torturing myself?! I can't believe I made it as long as I did especially being able to watch it the entire time I did with my eyes open. If you like movies that will bore you out of your mind then watch Devil With Seven Faces (Is it Devil With Seven Faces or Devil Has Seven Faces? Different sites, different names. Either way I guess it doesn't matter. This movie SUCKED!!!) If you can sit through the entire movie without falling asleep or turning it off, you have my respect",1497312000,,1074,4.143540669856459
8206612,2,B000SSONL6,"Julie and Mary are twins (both Carroll Baker!). Julie gets a phone call from Mary claiming she is in trouble. Julie fears for her life as she is threatened by burglars. She has some friends watch over her, but they are not there all the time. Half way through the film we discover they are looking for jewels.

The restoration was fair. Note the Bic lighter used as a ""flashlight"" before the age of cell phones. Also Julie must stay at her home because she awaits a call from Mary. Time hasn't been kind to the production. The writing and acting are no longer entertaining.

Guide: No swearing. Brief rear nudity. Implied sex. Woman gets blouse ripped open. On 50 DVD multi-packs.",1478736000,,680,4.565573770491803
8206613,4,B000SSONL6,"THE DEVIL HAS 7 FACES has Carroll Baker (THE SWEET BODY OF DEBORAH, BABA YAGA) in a dual role -sort of- as twin sisters, Julie and Mary Harrison. Successful travel agent Julie gets a mysterious call from Mary, that gives her the sense that Mary is in serious trouble. Soon, Julie is stalked and terrorized by a group of  ruthless criminals. Not-so-surprisingly, they seem to have her confused w/ her shadier sister. The police get involved, and are suitably baffled. Julie and her friend Tony (George Hilton) try to figure out what's going on. Could it have anything to do w/ a recent diamond heist? Murder and madness transpire. TDH7F is a solid mystery / crime-thriller w/ some nice twists, and, of course, the beautiful Ms. Baker! I particularly enjoy the ""windmill scene"" and the finale. It also sports a groovy, jazzy soundtrack, and men w/ enormous sideburns! Worth checking out...",1407110400,2,887,4.874172185430464
8206614,2,B000SSONL6,"Carrol Baker made some great flicks during the late sixties and seventies
in Italy.  Movies like Orgasmo (paranoia) among others but this wasn't one of them.  This movie is technically a giallo because it is a thriller.
But it is a movie that is hard to follow in some ways. Incidents like  A body appears , and then is gone and there is no reason for it don't make it any easier to follow the story either. But the basic plot involves a woman who steals a diamond and then involves her twin sister
in the plot. A american gang comes after her in order to steal the diamond and the twin sister is vicitmized by the situation. Or is she?
Carrol Baker does a decent job of acting here but the ultra cool George Hilton really puts in a great performance here.  Stephan Boyd is not too bad either but none of them can pull this flick above average at best.
The music is pretty cool though and the garish wigs that appear on some of the characters only adds to the general strangeness.
This movie was shot in widescreen and unfortunately it's shown in full screen here. THe print is also not the best but it's watchable.  This isn't a hideous movie but its at the bottom rung of the giallo scale of goodness.  It takes place in holland though which is unusual for  a giallo.  And they don't make this a easy film to follow even though the sisters have different hairstyles.  If  you are into these mystery movies and like me; have to have them all; then I would put this on the buying list but otherwise grab one of the many other easier to follow giallos first.",1228348800,10,1557,4.301369863013699
