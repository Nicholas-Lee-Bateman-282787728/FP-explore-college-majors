8357939,5,B0029LHMTU,"This is a great documentary giving viewers a glimps into the internal and external struggles of a transsexual's journey to gender reassignment surgery. While Rene is extremely unlikable, you cannot help but sympathize with him. It would be nice to get a follow-up documentary to capture what his continued journey has been, especially now that society is more accepting of the LBGT community relative to 10+ years ago. It's now legal in CA for same sex marriages. Anyhow, it would be great to hear an update or to even capture what this experience is like for people in the 2016. Has surgical techniques improved to give people like Rene a more satisfying result, for example.",1464998400,,676,4.886956521739131

8357943,5,B0029LHMTU,"This documentary was filmed 10 years ago at one of the most trying times in my life.
At that time in my life I was  being betrayed by everyone I held dear including my ex-wife.  I think that would be enough to drive anyone to the point of extreme anger.
The show takes you through the tragic breakup of 2 people who loved each other but could not come through the otherside of the biggest trial of their lives together.
It follows the final phase of my transition into manhood, and leaves you with me standing in the mirror at a crossroads in life.
It is a verite look at the hardships of what it is like to be a transsexual man in a HETEROSEXUAL man's world.
It shows you a piece of the journey I have taken to become whole.  And true enough it is only one man's perspective of what it means to be TRANS, it is my perspective, because it's my story.",1433289600,6,850,4.13939393939394
8357944,3,B0029LHMTU,"For its time, it isn't the worst documentary to cover anyone in the trans population. It's very honest in that the film lets the people participating do all the talking rather than narrate its own agenda.

This film centers around a man named Rene who is dealing with struggles of Christian community, family acceptance, and the unraveling of his marriage as he prepares for his upcoming hysterectomy and genital reconstructive surgery.

One thing I do wish is that the producers took a second to alert the audience that this is just one male transsexual's experience and that being trans in and of itself isn't what sucks, it's the fact that most of society chooses to treat us like crap and we have a ridiculous amount of unfair and unrealistic expectations put on our shoulders.

Rene, while I totally sympathize with him, is unlikeable. He's a hyper-masculine, misogynistic, stubborn bully who displaces his frustrations on his loved ones rather than on people who are blatantly making his trans status an issue. And while medical transition can be a very selfish process (it kind of has to be), that doesn't give anyone license to be a dick to anyone who cannot, try as they might, really understand what it's like to be trans or immediately switch pronouns, etc.",1291852800,11,1268,4.861111111111111
