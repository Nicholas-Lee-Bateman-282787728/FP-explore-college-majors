8202338,5,B000RPCJQQ,"THE SERIES OF PRODUCTIONS IN THIS SERIES ARE HIGHLY INFORMATIIVE, FACTUALLY ACCURATE (AS FAR AS I CAN TELL) AND THEIR PRODUCTION VALUES ABSOLUTELY FIRST RATE.",1418515200,,158,5.36
8202339,5,B000RPCJQQ,This shows how interesting war can if you look to other things besides battles.  Thanks to photography we can actually see and hear the  actual sights and sounds of the past. It is more enjoyable tto than reading a book about it.,1360281600,2,229,4.428571428571429
8202340,5,B000RPCJQQ,"A very outstanding set of dvd's. It tells and shows the story of heavy water experiments and the secrets of Winston Churchell with his secret estate of code breakers. It even has a chapter of the modern German Subs during the war. It is a must if you enjoy honest detailed information and video clips of the war. It shows just 2 or 3 days after Pearl harbor,the German Subs were one or two miles off the shore of the N.J. Highway with actual films of the subs inside and out.",1354752000,3,475,4.230769230769231
8202341,5,B000RPCJQQ,"This is mainly a review about one of the discs in the 3 disc set--the one about the code breaking unit in an English manor house near Oxford. I should mention that I am an expert in cryptography and teach a two semester course at UC and devote two and a half classes to showing this incredible disc. (Two hours = 120 minutes, which is two 50 minute classes plus 20 minutes out of 50 minutes of a third class.) I used to show the VHS tape, but the tape players were removed from the classrooms, so I converted my VHS copy to a DVD. Then one of the students found this DVD set on the Amazon.ca (Canada) website.

The disc may be too technical for some tastes, but my students love it and consider it to be the high point of the course. The other two discs are less technical and tell interesting stories also.

It is a NOVA, so you can expect that a real effort was made to make it accessible. Don't watch all two hours at once! When the program was made, many of the geniuses on the project were still alive and gave interviews. Many are famous now.

Some of the high points:

*They invented the electronic computer and used it to crack the Lorenz Cipher Machine, enabling the Normandy invasion, thereby shortening WW II by two years.

*The extraordinary genius Alan Turing invented Artificial Intelligence to help determine the plug board settings on the Enigma coding machine. He was no longer alive to give an interview, but artificial intelligence great Donald Michie gave one.

*Turing developed the same theory of information that Claude Shannon did in the similar US project, which is still shrouded in secrecy. Both men developed it for code cracking of course.",1325808000,7,1668,4.524916943521594
8202342,5,B000RPCJQQ,"Includes five NOVA programs from PBS...
The best of which is the absolutely superb ""Decoding Nazi Secrets"" (1999) which clocks in at a bit less than 120 minutes. This marks the very first time that ""Decoding Nazi Secrets"" has been struck to DVD by WGBH, the producer of these PBS-Nova shows and the distributor of their home video products. Previously, it was only marketed by WGBH on VHS tape. I cannot remember the last time I purchased a VHS... of anything.
Yet, just seven months ago, when I asked WGBH via email why this fine program was not being produced on DVD, they replied that ""Only the programs having good VHS sales are considered for DVD by their marketing managers."" ...Now there is one smart merchandising plan!
Well, small wonder... that's just one of the many reasons why PBS finds it hard to make ends meet.",1186012800,40,826,4.664383561643835
