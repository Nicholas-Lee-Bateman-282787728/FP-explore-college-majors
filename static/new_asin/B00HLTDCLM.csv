6172224,5,B00HLTDCLM,"It was due to a Vanity Fair interview article of Angelina (Dec. 2014) that I took interest in ""Unbroken"" that premiered today. Interesting  in the article that where Angelina lives in Hollywood Hills she could see Zamperini's house from hers. She lobbied to direct this man's story and got the go from Universal. She actually talked with him on the phone and showed him scenes from her filming before he died this past July. Since I am a great admirer of all this young woman does, I was impressed with the movie today. Normally I would prefer something a little lighter and funny for Christmas, but I think it is well done. The strength of Zamperini's spirit is amazing. The scenes of the three airmen floating in rafts surrounded by sharks will make you jump about out of your seats. The biggest shame of all is that people have to be so cruel to one another, but strength of character, resilience do win!",1419465600,9,907,4.564417177914111
6172225,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Unbroken""

1. This movie is based on the true story of Louis Zamperini, a troubled kid that became an Olympic runner, and then fought in World War II, spent 47 days on a life-raft, and over 2 years in a Japanese POW camp.

2.  If you've seen the trailer to this movie, you've basically seen the whole movie, except for the violence.

3.  I know it's supposed to be inspirational, but this movie is my pick for the most feel-bad movie of 2014.

4.  The best scene of the movie is the first one, when we get to see a crew of American bombers in a sky battle. After that, nothing really happens except a guy goes through hell and is still alive at the end.

5.  A pretty big chunk of the movie shows the guys just floating along in a life raft, slowly dying. The POW camp doesn't come along until somewhere in the last half of the movie.

6.  The movie gets more brutal and violent as it goes along. I don't know how it got released with a PG-13 rating.

7.  As a break from scenes of helplessness, humiliation, and torture, we are sometimes treated to inspirational quotes such as:
  ""The light always follows the darkness.""
  ""If you can take it, you can make it.""
  ""A moment of pain is worth a lifetime of glory.""
  I think those quotes were really for the audience, to encourage them to keep watching this movie.

8. The main Japanese character, Watanabe, was actually wanted for war crimes, so this movie runs with it and makes the Japanese look really evil. Some Japanese citizens are asking their government to not show the movie in Japan.

9. It's not a terrible movie, but it is so dramatic that it sometimes backfires.  And you should only go see it if you are interested in watching people survive a series of increasingly dehumanizing events. Otherwise, despite what the title of the movie is, you may finish the movie feeling kind of broken yourself.",1419465600,5,1890,4.41159420289855
6172226,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Californian Louis Zamperini was a young hellion who became a champion high school track star, and he ran for his country in the 1936 Olympics.  When the Second World War began, he became a bombardier in the U.S. Army Air Forces.  After his B-24 went down in the Pacific he endured 47 days on a life raft only to be captured by the Japanese.  His treatment in Japanese prison camps was brutal.  ""Unbroken"" brings his story to the big screen.  It's a film that should inspire new generations of Americans.

There's fine acting by Jack O'Connell as Zamperini, and Japanese rock guitarist Miyavi gives a chilling performance as Zamperini's tormenter.  The sequences in the B-24 well convey the nature of air operations in the Pacific and the coordination of aircrews.  You'll jump in your seat when the sharks attack.  And ""Unbroken"" provides a reminder of the brutality of the Japanese endured by allied POWs during the war.  (The recent film ""Railway Man"" with Colin Firth and Nicole Kidman gave more testimony.)

Many viewers will have come to this film after reading Laura Hillenbrand's book of the same title.  Every screenplay writer and director must condense, and those who know the full story will notice that director Angelina Jolie did some trimming.  The movie ends with Zamperini's return to the U.S. and the embrace of his family.  That he could not shake off the demons of his imprisonment is left unshown.  It was Billy Graham that turned him away from the alcoholism that was devastating his postwar life.  ""Unbroken"" needs a dramatic sequel to finish its tale of heroism and faith.

That said, the story of Louis Zamperini's running career and his ""unbroken"" spirit as a prisoner of war is enough to make this a compelling film.

6172314,3,B00HLTDCLM,The movie was interesting but the movie stopped way to short of the real miracle in  Louis Zamperini's life.. So Hollywood again paints a picture that elevates man ability to overcome adversity by his own strength. Louis falls apart when he gets home and almost destroys his life and family but God steps in and puts him back on the right track. I would suggest that you read a book about him if you are interested in the real story. A good children book about Louis Zamperini is writen By Janet and Geoff Benge.,1528934400,,512,4.446808510638298

Everything Louis went through in his life was so much, that any guy would just lose his head after everything and become a vengeful person. But not Louis, everything he went through made him a much stronger man and human being, and most of all a very forgiving man. This is one of those movies I will never forget.

6172739,4,B00HLTDCLM,"""Unbroken"" tells the story of Louis Zamperini, a WW2 bombardier and former Olympian, who is captured and survives a brutal Japanese prisoner-of-war camp.  After crashing into the Pacific and nearly drowning when a rescue mission goes south, Zamperini finds himself aboard a life raft with the only remaining survivors.  They drift for well over a month without rescue, facing thirst, hunger, exposure and sharks before catching the unsympathetic attention of the Japanese military.  He and the remaining survivor are quickly sent to POW camps where the Japanese start trying to break them.  Zamperini is subjected to utterly brutal treatment - Japanese POW camps were usually a death sentence - and he has to decide whether he has the will to endure it.
The film certainly has a noble objective as stories of the power of the human spirit often do and the plot and pacing draw the viewer in effectively.  But it just isn't enough.  The overall writing and directing fail to ultimately create the emotional resonance one would expect in such a film.  The scope is simply too large and critical scenes fly by too quickly.  The time needed to create a bond with a character just is not there - instead, you get a sprawling, shallow something that longs to be an epic.  The rest of the film's burden lays with the cast who bears it well.  Thankfully, they are a more than capable lot who, along with the production team, help to make this worth watching.  But one wonders how good it could have been.",1502236800,4,1496,4.75968992248062

6172902,5,B00HLTDCLM,"This is truly a great movie!  I didn't realize when I purchased it that it was based on a true story, which is why I would describe it as a great movie.  Without giving too much of it away, it's about Louis Zamperini (played by Jack O'Connell), who learns about the value of forgiveness.  The movie starts off with him in on assignment in a military aircraft that looses its hydraulics after being shot on assignment, but still manages to return and make an emergency landing.  On a second military flight assignment, while flying over the ocean, the plane he is on stops working and crashes into the water.  While this is taking place, he begins to reflect on his running accomplishments when he was a young boy.  After the crash landing into the ocean, only him and two crewman survive, and are stuck at sea for 47 days before the Japanese navy find him and the one surviving crewman, and makes them POWs.  He is treated horribly during the entire time he was held as a POW, but manages not to let the conditions get to him and ultimately is released along with the other POWs because the war is over.  After returning to the United States, Jack gets to do what he was going to do prior to getting stranded at sea, which was run in the Olympics, which happens to be in Japan again (Japan is where the Olympics here going to be held, when he was planning on running in them).  Jack being much older, this time isn't running in the Olympics competitively, but instead as an Olympic torch carrier, and demonstrates his forgiveness while there.  The ending really surprised me, because I hadn't paid too much attention to what the movie was about when I originally purchased it.  If you're looking for a great drama movie based on a true story, that leaves you feeling good at the end, this would be a good one to watch.  Hope you enjoy it!",1495929600,4,1838,4.4375

Perhaps my disappointment is not valid - that it is just too hard to show what being a POW during WW 2 really is like in a movie.  While we follow the story, it is important to know that these histories are also representing what happened to all of our servicemen.  The war stories that get to print or to the screen may be individual feats of arms or endurance and will, but it was done countless times by so many to defeat the enemy.  There were lines not crossed in the movie that existed at the time.  Since Japan and the US are now allied and time and politics have become a lens to view history through, this has to be.  I would strongly suggest reading the book, and find a few more to read.  WW 2 remains being the high water of our modern US history, it's lessons as well as it's story seems to me to be fading with the distance of time.

I highly recommend that parents watch this with their older kids, so they can hopefully learn and appreciate the sacrifices that their grandparents and the Greatest Generation made to help keep American safe, powerful, respected and free. At a time when there is such a lack of respectable role models in modern society, this movie offers a glimpse at a rare and courageous role model, with genuinely honorable values that seemed to be so much more common in our earlier history.

NOT A FEEL GOOD MOVIE, or even a movie with an ending that makes it worth watching, the film barely scratches the surface of the complexities of being a POW and depersonalizes the honorable soldier it is based on.

I also recently saw The Railway Man which is also based on the true story of a POW (a British POW) who survives a Japanese prisoner of war camp, but years later after the war, by chance he has an opportunity to confront his Japanese tormentor who tries to repent for his war crimes.  If you enjoyed Unbroken, you should also watch The Railway Man which stars Nicole Kidman and Colin Firth--very compelling movie.",1466121600,,683,4.565573770491803

6174200,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Having read Hillenbrand's book, as well as Louie's own much better memoir (""Devil at My Heels""), I was excited to see the movie, but was somewhat disappointed.  It was not a terrible film, but it was simply not emotionally moving in the way that it should have been, given the raw depths and breadth of Louie's story.  One thing that irritated me, in particular, was the lack of attention to detail.  For example, when Louie is in the life rafts with the others for so many days, he still maintains a nicely-trimmed goatee, and one of the others stays clean-shaven, while the third one has a full beard, which is what you would expect all three of them to look like after so many days adrift at sea.  The same goes for the general appearance of Louie and others in the prison camps -- they are not only clean-shaven most of the time, but they often looked like they just had expensive haircuts at some Hollywood salon.  Huh?  The lack of attention to detail starts with the very first line in the movie, when the pilot says, ""We're here"" in a normal tone of voice, which would never happen because the engine noise from those multiple-propeller planes is deafening, especially with all the hatches wide open.  (That's why they need radio intercoms to communicate.)  In other words, the pilot should have had to scream, ""We're here,"" not simply say it in a normal voice.  It's the lack of attention to details like this that detract from any film, because they make it harder for a viewer to suspend disbelief, and easier to think of the film as merely a bunch of actors on a movie set, saying lines into cameras, etc.  It also means that the film's creators simply didn't care enough to get the details right -- contrary to their incessant bragging about how important the film, or ""the project,"" was to them, etc.  The ending of the film, which provided a cursory treatment of Louie's post-war struggles, was also very disappointing.  Although the film was on the lengthy side, the editors would have done better to cut 10-15 minutes of the many repetitive scenes and then add more substance to Louie's post-war battles.  Actually, the short documentary film that appears on the DVD, entitled ""The Real Louie Zamperini,"" was more enjoyable in some respects than the main film, so that's something, I guess.",1465516800,,2307,4.666666666666667

6174205,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Unbroken, directed and produced by Angelina Jolie, is a true story based on the life of Louis Zamperini (played by Jack OConnell).  Louis was a rebellious kid growing up but one never knows why we are who we are.  As Louie began to grow up his brother took him under his wings and challenged him to use his energy for long distance running. Every race that Louie entered into he won. As he was preparing to take his athletic career further World War II (WWII) occurred.

Louie and a few other airmen were fighting, when their plane was hit and only three of them survived.  They ended up on lifeboats and had to use their survival skills to stay alive, one of them died and was buried at sea.  One day while still on lifeboats the remaining two were captured by the Japanese and became prisoners of war.  As they began to get tortured, the rebellion that had become a part of Louies life, would be the same character trait that would help him to survive.

After Louie was released from the prison camp, he found God.  Louie knew that God had a plan for his life. As Louie began to embrace his intimate relationship with God, he realized that in order to heal he needed to forgive.  Not only forgive himself but forgive his tormentors as well, then his journey began.  If you are looking for a story about character, challenges and forgiveness give Unbroken a try, you will not regret it.",1465171200,,1387,4.446640316205533

This could have been SO much better because the source story is absolutely riveting and one of the greatest stories from WWII. First of all, it needed a better score. The music does not create the epic feel of this epic story. Secondly, some of the CGI was embarrassing. Take a look at the storm at sea with the rafts. I was surprised how absolutely fake it looked. Thirdly, Louie's character is pretty flat. None of the complexity of this great man as seen in Laura Hilldebrand's book is seen on screen. His relationship with his family is so poorly presented that when they're reunited at the end, there's little to no emotion. His turning to God and finding a way to forgive is a postscript and not even seen in the movie. So, I recommend that you do see this movie because it's not absolutely horrible and I quite like the way the sequences are presented in the film, but most importantly, do not miss reading the amazing book.",1464998400,,957,4.569767441860465

Not only is the story in this film gripping, but the music, cinematography, and acting is also very well done.  So, even though the story doesn't match up perfectly with the original, you can appreciate this film for what it does have to offer.

I really appreciate being able to purchase films digitally from Amazon.  There was a time when I would have to buy entire VHS or DVD's  and store them in my classroom to be able to use clips from a film. I hated the clutter! Now I can store them all digitally an Amazon.

6174378,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Unbroken, as a movie, was a wonderful movie. It shows us the necessary things we needed know about Louie Zamperini's life and it made for a good WWII film.

Unbroken, as a movie based on a book, was not as good. Angelina Jolie left out much of Louie's life that would have helped us understand him better. When watching a movie, you don't get the opportunity to see what the characters are thinking, instead you assume. We assume that it was hard for Louie in the POW camps. In the book we know it was hard because he tells us that.

Despite the lack of detail the movie provides, I think readers and watchers will walk away with the same feelings of sympathy and remorse.",1462492800,,672,4.368
6174379,2,B00HLTDCLM,"I'll start by saying that the movie in and of itself was a fine movie. I enjoyed some of the scenes thoroughly, thought the actors gave an effective display, and I could sense the emotions of the scenes easily. I do want to emphasize the word 'fine' though, as I don't believe this movie is good in any regard.
The movie had enjoyable scenes, specifically through highlighting the different ways Louis was treated by the many people he met. Overall, though I felt the movie was quite dull and mild in its display. I didn't feel as though the situations had the same sense of dread as in the book. With scenes in the book, you can sense that these men were terrified of their situation; in the movie, they all seemed so dead internally.
I honestly don't care too much that some scenes from the book were smashed together, rearranged, or even left out; it's a movie adaptation of a book, it's going to happen. It stayed truthful to the book in the parts that truly mattered, removed some unnecessary bits, and switched roles to keep the starring actors on the screen for the longest time possible.
All in all, the movie was as I said, fine; it could be boring at times but it was fine. It worked well in its job as a film adaptation, less so as a documentary/biographic film. It gave an easily viewable emotion and point to the scenes, something words can not do as effectively.",1462492800,,1376,4.464285714285714
6174380,3,B00HLTDCLM,"In this film unbroken, I do not think she did the justice to the story Louie Zamperini. I do not think that she captured the true spirit of this novel. In the film it shows how hard it really was for Louie, Mac, and Phil after the crash on the life raft, but it did not go into detail what they went through. Did not show they had to eat and how they had to collect water and save it. when I read this I was in shock about what Louie had to go through in the POW camp. I respected Louie after the movie now I admire Louie. I think that she did not put enough in the movie to show the real life of Louie. I think that she just made another WWII movie to get her some more money.",1462492800,,677,3.7746478873239435

Reading the novel after watching the movie, you notice several differences in how events really happened. In the beginning of the movie, you don't get a true sense of how much of a trouble maker Louie was. For example, the movie showed that he was in trouble, but to the extent that he was really was, for he constantly got in trouble. Now to go more into the story. Angelina did a good job capturing the picture of the survivors at sea, though she left out the intensity or the sharks, and what the men did to stay sane. There were things she left out of the book such as post POW time. They had problems like alcoholism and PTSD, and also the fact that war criminals were captured. In all, the movie was okay in comparison to the book, but I strongly recommend that you read the book.",1462492800,,947,4.29608938547486

I think the actors did a very good job of acting as the characters would, and they even looked similar to the real people. Both the film and the book were excellent, but I feel like they were told in two different directions. The book went into such detail, but the movie kind of kept things and short and kept moving on to the next scene. For example, in the movie it never talked about Louies struggle with religion, or how he turns his life around from being an alcoholic but the book does. I give this move three and a half stars because it as very well done, but many major details were left out.",1462492800,,932,4.043243243243243

While there were several good aspects of the film, there were countless things Jolie did not include, that were present in Laura Hillenbrand's, well written, extremely detailed and very moving novel ""Unbroken"".  With its vivid details and entertaining yet historical events, this novel keeps you engaged the whole way and provides much more information. There were also various things that were different character wise. Reading the book, you can get a much better feel and understanding of the story and see that there is a lot more to each character than Angelina portrays. The film didn't really touch on anything that had gone on after Louie got back from the war either, which I think was one of the most important parts.",1462406400,,843,4.9787234042553195
6174514,3,B00HLTDCLM,"I think that the movie was over all a good film, but it is nothing compared to the novel. If you want to learn the whole story of Louie Zamperini, I suggest you buy the book instead of the movie. The movie leaves out a lot of important detail and skips over many events through out his life. The movie also lacks the emotions you feel while reading the novel. The author of the novel really got you to get to know Louie, while in the movie you just knew his background. Also you get to learn about the other characters in detail. You learn about their lives and their relationships with Louie. The movie just focuses on Louis and his story and not the people he went through it with or who has helped him along the way. Overall the movie was good if you watch it before you read the novel. If you read the novel then watch the movie you will be very disappointed and upset with the directors decisions of how to make the novel come alive. I suggest that you take time to read the novel and to actually get to know the story, instead of wasting your time watching the movie.",1462406400,,1073,4.188405797101449

After reading the novel I realized that Louie went through a lot more than what the movie portrayed. I felt a lot of respect and admiration for Louie still because of what he went through. The average movie viewer does not come away from the movie with the same feelings.  They aren't able to get a grasp on what life was really like. They can get an idea but never fully understand it.  The movie doesn't come close to showing how Louie was treated in the POW camps.  The criticism I have for the move is simple.  In the beginning it doesn't portray how Louie really was hated as a child. Neighbors despised him and yet this was hardly told about in the movie.  Then to add to that, life stranded at sea was far worse than what was told.  Lastly, the POW camps were no where close to what they really were in the book.  Louie was treated as though he was nothing and beaten far worse than what was shown.  I feel all actors represented the characters and roles well.  Suffering and the plot I feel were the two big things that could've been fixed.",1462406400,,1191,4.257777777777778

She did an ok job at making money for herself but not honoring who deserves it.",1462406400,,479,4.393258426966292
6174517,3,B00HLTDCLM,"If you haven't read the book then watch the movie first. Other wise you'll have some pretty big let downs. Angelina Jolie did a pretty good job of putting this book into a movie despite the fact that she left out so key parts and details. For example, she didn't show the extent of Mutsuhiro Wantanabe's psychotic personality. Honestly, in my opinion, Louis Zamperini's incredible story cannot be cramped into a movie. There is just too much that happened to try to fit it all into 2 hours or so. Hillenbrand's book truly does the justice of Louis' life. I don't think that it could've been told any better than by Laura Hillenbrand. This is an exception book and the movie is okay. The characters were pretty good. Just don't expect the movie to be any where near as great as the book.",1462406400,5,786,4.503496503496503

My heart also broke for him because the way the commander was so cruel to him.  After I had read the book I felt that if a person who has not read the book would feel the sane,  But I so think Angelina Jolie did a great job at finding the characters to look similar to how they looked in real life.

The movie could have included more about his childhood and his track career.  One of the things I didn't like the most was the fact that she didn't show what happened after the war was over and what it was like for him and his friends.  We didn't get to see what happened to the guards, or how the POWs were effected after the war.  The actors did a good job at portraying the roles too and were very believable.  So the movie was well written, but could have used more detail. To add more would make it a longer movie, but she did a good job in showing what Louie had to endure and getting the point of his life across the two hours.

The movie was great but i think you should read the novel first.  The book gives you much more fine details through out.  I didn't like the movie as much because of the ending.  It was very short compared to the novel.  In the novel you get to learn much more about each individual character more.  Over all the movie is not just another World War II  Movie.

The book goes more in depth about his experience from the Olympics, when he was in the raft, from being a POW, to his life after the war when he was rescued. I understand that for a movie you get only a certain amount of time to put all you can in, but it could have been better. I highly recommened reading the book AFTER you watch the movie if you want to do both. Lastly I will say that the actors didn't do a to bad of a job.",1462406400,,643,4.0234375

The book is so extensiveLaura Hillenbrand spent seven years meticulously researching Mr. Zamperinis life in order to do him justiceit would be near impossible to create a film that has the same impact as the book. Even keeping this in mind, the movie still pales in comparison. Undoubtedly, the film is well-intentioned: it strives to illustrate Louies bravery, strength, and unwillingness to break. Ultimately, it fails to convey a fraction of it. My biggest issue came with the omission of the entire last part of the book, which contains the other central message of the book: healing and forgiveness. The movie ends with Louie returning home to his family. Fade to blackeverything afterwards is apparently peaches and cream. However, as readers know, much of Louies journey happens after his liberation as he struggles to cope with what he has endured and learns to forgive, move on, and eventually use the pain and suffering he has endured to help others. The loss of this robs the movie of important meaning. Overall, the movie is a pallid imitation of the book that fails to impart significant lessons and meaning. By itself, it isn't a bad movie, but keeping the book and real life of Louie Zamperini in mind, it fails to measure up at all.",1462406400,,1382,4.7625

When reading the novel, especially part IV, I was always in awe of the conditions of living in the camps. The book goes into great detail when describing the abuse Louie endured, yet in the movie, you see just a few tiny glimpses of this abuse. Also, in the book, I admired the soldiers for sabotaging the Japanese by throwing a train of its tracks, but when i watched the movie, this important part was completely left out. I think people who have only seen the movie received some of the same feelings as the book readers did but these feelings were not of the same intensity. The actors they used to portray the characters seemed to fit each part perfectly. Overall, the movie was well made, with my only complaint being that it left out big parts of the story. Otherwise, very well done.",1462406400,,990,4.5055555555555555
6174646,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Coming from a person who has never before seen the film or read the book, Unbroken, I think the book left a greater impact on me as opposed to the movie. Angelina Jolie did not capture the true spirit of the novel. To me, the movie seemed like another war movie, although it was a good movie, rather than a representation on Louie Zamperini's life in particular like Laura Hillenbrand demonstrated in the novel. For example, Jolie left out the whole last part of the novel which, in my opinion, is very important. Louie's life after war remained unknown for those who just watched the movie. Jolie left out the struggles that Louie faced and left out how he eventually expressed forgiveness toward Japan and even the Bird. I will take away more emotion from the book and truly think it will stick with me for a long time. The movie however, just seemed like another movie. Of course some scenes will stand out to me, but a description in words does far more justice. As far as actors go, I think Louie's actor did a good job playing his role but I did not like Phil's actor. I think they could have chose someone better. While reading after watching the film, I couldn't seem to match Phil's actor with the character in the movie. All together, I think the book was way more touching, leaving an emotional impact, rather than watching the film. I took away a better understanding of Louie's life on a more personal level from reading the novel.",1462406400,,1444,4.515267175572519
6174647,3,B00HLTDCLM,"I feel that Angelina Jolie did do a great job in telling the really exciting parts of this amazing true story. However she did not do so great of a job when it comes to the reality and sequence of events that really happened. She left out a lot such as the Island that Louie and Phil washed up on, NOT A SHIP! She also left out a whole camp and Sasaki who really set a role in the overall tone of the book. While the movie was not accurate when it is based on the book. The actor choices i felt were very good. The Bird came off as the twisted person he really was and Louie's troubled childhood transitioned well into his heroic status. While the movie shows the exciting parts of the story it leaves out several important parts which is why I am taking away two stars.",1462406400,,770,4.105960264900662
6174648,3,B00HLTDCLM,"As one of the people who has read the book and saw the movie, I was not entirely impressed overall by the movie. There is a different circumstance where I watched the movie before I read the book but it did not make me feel any strong emotions. I am sure Angelina Jolie did not do the story justice but then again who can direct a movie that is just as good as the book. It is just when you read the book you basically are one and the same with the characters and you see and know how they feel. You get more sense of admiration and connect to them better. While I feel as if Angelina Jolie didn't do an amazing job portraying this magnificent novel, who could? You have to shrink it down enough in the movie to actually be a movie. She also could have used more emotion so it did not feel like another WWII film.",1462406400,,813,4.055900621118012

The movie is very good but if you haven't read the book before you will not like the movie at all. There is so much detail in the book, the movie didn't have all of the background information or what happened at the end.

I felt more emotions by reading the story than watching the movie. I felt like I was one of the characters when reading. I feel the movie was just another WWII movie, rather than capturing it's true spirit. I watched the movie first then read the story. At first I thought the movie was great. Then I read the book. So much of what actually happened is left out. To truly appreciate what Louie was put through, one should read the book.",1462320000,,599,4.3097345132743365

All in all, if one were to watch the movie, one would be thoroughly entertained. If one were to compare the book to the movie, the movie does not do Louie justice. Louie Zamperini went through hell and back in his real life experience, and the movie barely showed a portion of the events that actually happened. Like I previously stated, it is an exceptional movie, it just does not do Louie Zamperini justice.",1462320000,,542,4.597938144329897

6174773,3,B00HLTDCLM,"The book Unbroken by Laura Hillenbrand, describes the many obstacles that Louie had gone through to survive. This movie, shows little of what actually happens.  The movie does not include the epilogue.  The epilogue is a huge part of the book, which tells us what each other them do after they are home. In the movie, you hear little about Louie's marriage and what he goes through, such as turning into an alcoholic. Phil has three kids. Harris was never found, and was told to be captured. The movie was good for those who have not read the book. The book strictly gives us more of an emotional attachment to Louie and to the stories of the men that were captured. I think that anyone who wants to see this movie, should read the book first and get the real story of what happens.",1462320000,,782,4.423611111111111
6174774,3,B00HLTDCLM,"I believe that Angelina Jolie did a poor job at telling the story of Louie Zomperini.  I felt more connected and admired Louie more for what he did after reading the novel than I did after watching the movie.  The movie made me feel like it was another WWII movie, that to casual fans who didn't read the book would enjoy.  Jolie missed all of part 5 from the book.  She didn't do a very good job at making us feel heartbroken every time something didn't go his way.  I don't like how she casted Wotonabe because he wasn't very intimidating like all of the POWs described him as and I felt that in the movie Wotonabe was being to nice to Louie instead of torturing him like he should of. I think the average movie viewer came away impressed with the movie but people who have read the book will think otherwise.",1462320000,,811,4.2745098039215685

But if you saw the movie after reading the book, you would probably be disappointed on how much detail was left out in the movie.  Angelina Jolie did a great job of making the book come to life, but I feel like she could have done better.  Mutsuhiro Wantanabe's full personality wasn't shown in the movie.  The book goes into more detail on what he did to the prisoners and why he targeted Louie more.  She left out important parts of Louie's life out of the movie and didn't fully show how Louie felt or was thinking during the war.  She ended the movie after the war ended and Louie heading home, but did you know there was a whole part after that?  Angelina didn't even touch on how Louie suffered after the war.  It was a good book that didn't need to be a movie.",1462320000,,849,4.229813664596273
6174776,3,B00HLTDCLM,"The movie Unbroken was a sad representation of Louie's life and journey.  Angelina made Louie out to be the extraordinary man he was, but left out numerous details that give Louie his character later on.  For example, the stealing and plots in the camps in Japan were nonexistent.  We never got to see how the men would collect and hide their treasures.  Along with the stealing I believe Angelina didn't give the correct details of the guards and she forgot to mention important people.  She had Jimmie Sasaki being The Bird, when that was not true.  The Bird was a different man completely.  The movie however does make you feel great respect and admiration for Louie, non of the other prisoners along with him.  The movie does not mention much for Louie's life after the war.  The only thing that is mentioned is the running of Olympics.  The book gives you such more emotion and feelings to all the prisoners in the camp, not just Louie.  I strongly encourage you ti read the book along with watch the movie.  Louie Zamperini and all the men are inspirational and admirable.",1462320000,,1078,4.645502645502646
6174777,2,B00HLTDCLM,"Unbroken was a great movie, but if you have read the book you would know the film is nothing like the novel. The overall plot is the same, but lacking very important aspects of Louie's life. The director, Angelina Jolie, left out Part 5 and the Epilogue from the movie which are extremely important to know as you learn what happens to Louie after he returns to everyday life. Jolie makes it appear that everything is great for Louie when in reality he encounters many struggles. The movie does not even begin to capture the torture Louie had to endure. He suffered for so long at the hands of the Bird. My personal opinion would be to read the book and pretend that the movie never existed as it was only made for money and not to show the struggles a POW had to face during WWII.",1462320000,,781,4.319727891156463

I THINK the point was survival. Or, it could have been how brutal people can be to each other in wartime. No shock there.
There are MANY films from WWII that make that point without being that disgusting. Trying to pull it out at the end with a sentence about forgiveness came across as incredibly shallow. Sorry, this one was a lemon.",1461801600,,716,4.6015625

6174923,5,B00HLTDCLM,"After reading the book, this was truly the most accurately depicted movie based on a book I've ever seen. The movie was everything I'd hoped it would be. The only drawback for me was that it did not continue with the character's story about his coming to know Jesus as his personal Savior after several years of PTSD and alcoholism, and how his life changed after that.  However, in the documentary in the ""extra's"" of this DVD this was heavily talked about by the character himself. So I urge you to watch all the special features and interviews after watching the movie. Allow plenty of time because this is a long movie. But you will not be bored or disappointed!  Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job as director. I even believe she expressed a real acknowledgement of the power of Jesus Christ as something much bigger than what we see in Louis Zamprrini's life during her interview.  It looked as though she was deeply moved as she spoke of the faith and power in this mans life, because of his faith in Jehovah God.

The book was fantastic and is such a moving story of the incredible ordeals that Louis Zamperini endured. Not only did he endure, he triumphed. His courage, fortitude and faith is something we can admire and all learn from.

The movie adaptation was just terrible. It just did not capture the true emotion that the book evoked. There were abrupt transitions and flashbacks that just weren't executed well. There was just too much wrong with the movie. Even the music seemed misplaced.

6175043,1,B00HLTDCLM,"Many movies made from books are far worse than the book.  This is no exception.

(One brilliant exception--Clockwork Orange--is even more terrific as a movie than a book.  But that's Kubrick.)

The book is thrilling, informative, involving, moving, altogether a stirring read.  The movie cuts out much of the most heartrending parts, the last third, and compresses and deadens the rest.

Much of the blame can be laid with the director.  There's hardly any interesting conflict.  Just one damn thing after another.  Also very little character development.  The two main characters--Zamperini and his nemesis The Bird--are just going through the motions.

A lot of blame goes also to the writers.  I was stunned when I saw the screenplay was written by Joel and Ethan Cohen.  The Cohens are usually fabulous, but here they are simply lifeless.

There is a lot of action, but it doesn't seem to go anywhere.  The actors look as though they don't know what to do next, and aren't sure of the kind of people they are supposed to represent.

The most interesting character is The Bird, Zamperini's sadistic nemesis in several prison camps, but here he is just a posturing, slightly camp figure given to posing.

There's no real tension.  Compare, for example, the scary electricity between Alec Guiness and Sessu Haiakawa in The Bridge on the River Kwai--a far better prison-camp movie in every way.  Here there is fear and stoicism, but no chemistry, and no overarching moral.

One thing Hillenbrand's book does superbly is give context.  None of that in this movie.  I suspect that for many viewers, the Pacific War is now as murky as the Wars of the Roses.  Some history might have helped.  Without it, the movie falls into the sad jingoism of ""Americans are always right, everyone else is always wrong""--a ridiculous trap that Bridge on the River Kwai adroitly avoids.

If you have not read the book and are piqued by the movie, definitely read the book.  You will be shocked at how such a vigorous and emotive book could have been made into such a snoozer.",1456704000,,2056,4.819484240687679

6175126,4,B00HLTDCLM,"After reading the book I wanted to watch the film to see how well it portrays Louis Zamperini's true story as told in the book. For the most part I felt the film follows the book fairly well. I had avoided seeing the movie in a theater when it was first released because the preview emphasized the brutal treatment afflicted on the American prisoners, most painfully on Louis Zamperini, and I do not like to see violence. Three advantages of the DVD over seeing the movie in a theater are (1) the film can be fast-forwarded through disagreeable scenes, (2) closed captioning provides clarity for dialogue that can be difficult to hear, and (3) the film can be reversed at any time to see an earlier scene again. This DVD is of good technical quality and the acting, costuming, and scenery are credible and convincing. I'm glad I purchased and watched the DVD, but if it had been available in my local public library I would have preferred to see their copy because I do not think I will want to watch the difficult experiences of the downed American airplane crew again. It's good to know that eventual release, a good life and active, productive old age came to Louis Zamperini, but for the most part the film is a painful experience to watch.",1456099200,4,1244,4.558035714285714

6175133,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Unbroken is visually an appealing story, unfortunately there is very, very little character development. Things just happen, with no explanation at all. Other than the main character, there are very few other characters worth mentioning. Characters are introduced then killed off two minutes later, or are introduced and apparently will be important, but then aren't. There is only one Japanese character who has any lines and he seems more like a cartoon character than an actual person. There is no explanation for his behavior besides ""he was born rich and thought he would be an officer, but failed."" That would explain sadness or depression but those are a long way off from sadistic cruelty. Also, he seems inappropriately beautiful for a soldier. Doesn't make sense when one looks at photos of the REAL, historical character. One thinks, yes, in real life he was just some normal guy, not this Japanese boy-band pinup. Why is Louie so rebellious as a kid? No explanation. What is his mother's name? His sisters' names? We don't know. How did Louie go from just being a good high school athlete to an Olympic-caliber one? No explanation. No progression. Nothing. Was his bomber shot down, or did it break down? Don't know. This movie is OKAY, but that's it. A lot of it is just plain boring. Right now it's being lauded because the real-like character was a hero and it's fashionable, but I don't think time will be kind to this movie, because really, it's mediocre.",1455753600,,1472,4.868525896414343

6175327,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Here is a movie that takes the middle third of an extremely well-written book (""Unbroken"") by Laura Hillenbrand (""Seabiscuit"") and, with the help of a quartet of screenwriters headed by the highly capable Coen brothers, Joel and Ethan, reminds us that not only is war hell but Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) is very painfully earned.

Director Angelina Jolie has crafted a PG-13 (brutality and language) film that illustrates the grim reality of our troops who were taken captive by the Japanese during the War in the Pacific after the attack on Pearl Harbor in WWII.

We ache for:
  * Jack O'Connell (""300: Rise of an Empire"") as Louis Zamperini, a high-school running phenomenon who set records that lasted for 20 years. This young Olympian is inspired by his terrific older brother who is trying to keep his rascally sibling out of reform school. Our hero's goal is to compete again in the 1940 Olympics to be held in Tokyo, but that plan is derailed by WWII.
  * Domhnall Gleeson (""Brooklyn"") is Phil, pilot of the doomed Green Hornet which crashes due to crew inexperience and mechanical failure after they are dispatched to look for downed fliers. Phil and Louis survive 42 days in a life raft only to be taken prisoner by enemy troops. Then their troubles REALLY begin!
  * Miyavi (""Oresama"" a music video) is Watanabe, the frustrated commander of the prison camp. His brutality is notorious and the starving prisoners have no recourse. He exploits the fame of his prisoner and targets him for ""special"" treatment.

Having just read Hillenbrand's excellent book, I was grateful to note that many of the more gruesome episodes were not included. The Zamperini family is faithfully rendered on screen, although I found myself filling in many blanks that weren't included because of the time constraints on a movie.

Make no mistake, Jolie has mounted this film in such a way that we can feel how cold and hungry our prisoners are, and how desperate they become. That plane that flies overhead near the end is a cheerful sight indeed! By the way, this film has been nominated for three Oscars.

I watched this DVD, with the luxury of closed captions. The best part was a tip I got from a private source who advised me to watch the extras. They are the best I have ever seen. Thank you! (You know who you are!)",1452124800,,2320,4.732009925558312

6175358,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Having read the book first I wanted to see the movie. Read the reviews both good and bad. Almost didn't get the DVD. I am glad I ended up ordering it. It is impossible to follow the book completely in a film. It captures well his boyhood trials in the depression, to his older brother getting him to run. You are in the plane on a bombing run, shooting at Zero's. A plane shot up so much a miracle it got back at all. For me the movie put you there.

 One of the great things about this DVD is the bonus feature The Real Louis Zamperini. To see that man who figured out that real forgiveness frees the soul as he says it all the hate only hurts yourself. After a period of PTS and drinking he made good his promise to God and spent the rest of his long life serving others his spirit strong to the end.",1451433600,,802,4.00625
6175359,5,B00HLTDCLM,"I knew nothing about this movie or its subject, Louie Zamperini. My wife rented this DVD and we watched it together. It's a powerful and moving film, extremely well made by Angelina Jolie (no, she does not appear in it), that I can highly recommend to anyone. It's an inspirational film about a truly remarkable human being. The film tells his life story respectfully and doesn't try to gloss over his imperfections. Showing his humanity is what makes him more heroic in the end.

The film shows each part of Louie's life: the trouble making youth; the Olympic runner who sets a world record; a WWII hero whose plane crashes into the sea; surviving on a raft for almost 2 months (another world record); being captured by the Japanese Navy and sent to a war camp where he is tortured; returning home after the war with post traumatic stress; how he finally frees himself from his demons and makes peace with the past by going back to Japan and forgiving his captors; then he goes on to live a long and eventful life.

It's an epic film, almost 2.5 hours long, and it could have been much longer. Many have stated the book is better than the film because the film leaves out things and cannot show everything he is thinking, etc. That's often the case but I haven't read the book and cannot truthfully compare the two. For us, it was the last part of the film, about his life after the war, that was the most inspirational. The life lesson about forgiveness is truly Biblical; it is the same with Ghandi and Mandela. If you like those films and life stories, you'll likely like this one as well.

Some people say the film looks like a made-for-TV movie. Maybe because it is a ""clean"" film, with no foul language or sex, etc. But I don't think those are needed to tell this story and I don't think the film lacks anything for omitting them. The film stays to true in its representation of each part of Louie's life. I'm so glad Jolie didn't try to turn this into an ""artsy"" film. One of the strengths of this film is that it does not draw attention to itself as a film; the focus is on the subject and the story.

For special features, there is only one on the DVD - a half hour documentary showing the real Louie Zamperini. It is a well made and edited feature, and again very moving and inspirational. The Blu-ray has several more features.

I will be buying this film, as I find it's worth owning and watching again. I definitely recommend you watch it, then decide for yourself if you want/need to own it.",1451433600,,2506,4.415584415584416

6175364,2,B00HLTDCLM,"Once more the dictum, read the book. The 30-minute supplement on the life of Zamperini far outshines the actual movie. It seems to be the fashion these days that a story cannot be told from beginning to end, this one follows the fashion beginning in the middle and telling the story through flashbacks.

It's probably too much to ask of any actor that Jack O'Connell be a match for the real Louis. The actors weight loss is one of the more remarkable aspects of the piece, this is not the husky soldier of the movie '71. However capturing the indomitable fire of the original is beyond him. In the scenes with the Bird the actor playing him looks boyish but fails to capture the sadistic delight that must have characterized the original. At least I wasn't convinced.",1451347200,,767,4.598540145985401

We were disappointed that is showed only during the war. Lots of men suffered during the war and died. He wasn't special that way. Lots of them for gave their torturers too but he changed his whole life and became a Christian only after he found he could not live a good life with out God to help. He was a wonderful person after God got a hold of him!  Wish it could have showed more of his life after the war.",1451260800,,550,4.092592592592593

6175434,4,B00HLTDCLM,"The movie is a good summary of Laura Hillenbrand's book.  But it's just that, a summary or a highlight reel.  The movie takes some creative liberties, but not any that I would consider unfaithful to the real story.  Usually movies try to make events more dramatic than reality.  But in this case, the opposite is true.  The movie actually tones down the events of Louis Zamperini's track feets, his survival at sea, and his treatment as a P.O.W. probably for the sake of time and trying to just keep things focused on Louis' unrelenting nature.

The book has the advantage of being able to tell a much fuller story.  Not just of what happened to Zamperini, but also provide details on the overall war effort and details like the history of the B-24 bomber, the progress of the war in the Pacific, daily survival techniques in a Japanese P.O.W camp, and the events in the years following the war.  It's an amazing story that the movie only scratches the surface.  So, 5 stars for the book, 4 stars for the watered down yet decent movie, and 100 stars for Zamperini and the other people who survived the P.O.W camps in the Pacific theater of WWII.",1450137600,,1145,4.546341463414634
6175465,3,B00HLTDCLM,"There's a short biographical film included in this DVD on Zamperini's life that is, in my opinion, worth the money you will pay for the feature itself. It is a moving portrait of a man that accomplished a lot in his long life, more than many of us hope to accomplish, that's for sure. This short film actually moved me to tears and gave me a rounded picture of Zamperini as a human being. The actual movie has many faults, but the biggest one was that  it didn't have the most important thing that the real Zamperini had, heart.
 I found it to be very depressing, I know, I know it's a POW film for crying out loud, what did you expect, right? Well usually, not always, but usually a POW film will at some point get passed the depression and show inspiration or redemption, and I really didn't get that from this movie. It was about 40 minutes of torture, the character's torture not the actual act of watching the film. Just when you thought the torture couldn't get any worse it always did. Does Zamperini stand up to his abusers? Yes, he does. But I found that Ms. Jolie really couldn't bring me, as an audience member, into the film itself.
On the positive side, I believe that Jack O'Connell is a huge talent, the guy can definitely act. I also believe that the other actors did a fantastic job of portraying these real men. The part of the film that I found most powerful and actually much more interesting than the rest of it, was actually the scenes on the raft, where there were just the three actors playing off each other and trying to stay alive between enemy fire and the man eating sharks( please don't get me started on the CGI sharks, they looked so horribly fake that I won't even waste more time mentioning them).
By the time the 40+ mins. of torture scenes are over it seemed like the director thought "" Well OK that's the story lets wrap this up"" and wham bam, that's the end, there's a shot of the reunion and that's it. No telling what happened later, as if his time as a POW was basically the most interesting thing that happened to him in his life. Believe me after you watch the short documentary that comes with the movie, you will see that there was so much more to this man's life.",1450137600,,2209,4.333333333333333

But anyways, I absolutely loved the book and Zamperini has become my idol, but if you want to hear the story, just read the book. Angelina Jolie did a great job and the acting was good but she wasn't able to incorporate a lot of the things that made the story for me, like the little pranks he pulled that always made me laugh and the friends he made in the POW camps. She didn't show the underground system of terrorism the POWs had going in the camps or the ways that the men banded together in the small things like giving the guards nicknames as jokes. I was inspired by their will to get as much dignity back as possible and it really wasn't shown in the movie. Also, I feel like the road to recovery was a huge part of Louie's character and story and a few sentences at the end didn't cut it for me. I know Jolie only had a matter of a couple hours to fit everything in, and I understand that she had to cut what she did, but if what all the nitty gritty and the fun details and facts, just go ahead and take the time to read the book. Hillenbrands writing is amazing and the book has so much more to give.",1448668800,,1177,3.9915254237288136

The amount (or lack there of) food that was give while in the POW camps was mentioned/shown once. The extent of illness that the POWs experienced was never a thought in the movie. The POW camps were portrayed, to me, as rather relaxed at time, which is not the feel I got from the book in any way.

6175599,5,B00HLTDCLM,"I liked this 2014 film about, telling a true war time story. The film is not perfect and maybe a little bit slow, but still it is a rather rare treat in modern cinema - a well told, uplifting tale fo true heroism and endurance. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

This is the story of first part of life of Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini (1917-2014) beginning with his childhood as a young Italian-American boy in Torrance, California, continuing with his career of distance runner (he went to the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin) and then going into the toughest part - the participation in Pacific War, which will be an ordeal...

This is only the third film directed by Angelina Jolie and this lack of experience can be seen by moments as ""Unbroken"" is indeed a little bit slow and long. The scenario was written by Coen brothers but albeit good, it is less stellar than most of their works. That being said, I liked it. This is an interesting, uplifting story about a quite likeable fellow, who overcame all kind of problems, troubles and ordeals to make something out of himself - and that is a very welcome thing. I cannot however go too much into details, in order to avoid spoilers.

The one thing that I really didn't like at all is that the film avoids to tell much about the crucial event in Zamperini's post-war life - his 1949 Christian conversion. From that moment to his death he was a devout born-again Christian and 65 years is a lot of time - the film however avoids going much into it... Well, knowing Hollywood's prevalent anti-Christian hatred it was only to be expected - but still, it is a disappointment...

All this being said, this is a good, solid, thing - it could have been a better film, but I still liked it a lot. A recommended viewing. ENJOY!",1447718400,,1791,4.518518518518518

6175653,4,B00HLTDCLM,"""Unbroken"" does not begin to describe what this movie is about. It's the true story of a delinquent boy who found his strength through running and turned that into an Olympic level talent. He then went on to use that same grit to survive the horrors of WWII, being adrift at sea for 47 days, and being held captive by a notoriously cruel prison camp commander. The story ends there, but in real life, he wasn't unbroken at all. The ""extras"" show that he suffered extreme PTSD, became an alcoholic, and almost lost his marriage. He became whole again after finding God at a Billy Graham service.

While the movie tells a good story (it opens with an air battle that had me in knots!) in an entertaining way, it just felt incomplete to me. The end of war isn't the end of the horror. In some ways, for the POW, going home is just the beginning of a different kind of battle. Anyway, maybe I am over analyzing things, but that is how it left me feeling.

6175747,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Released in 2014, ""Unbroken"" chronicles the true-life story of Louie Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) who ran the 5000 meter race in the 1936 Berlin Olympics and later joined the US Army Air Corps for WWII. Upon crashing in the Pacific he and two others (Domhnall Gleeson and Finn Witrock) must survive on a raft for almost seven weeks. When found by the Japanese they're placed in a POW camp and suffer the wrath of the commandant (Miyavi). Will they survive?

Directed by Angelina Jolie and scripted (partly) by the Coen brothers and based on Zamperinis biography by Laura Hillenbrand, this is a totally realistic account of Louies war-time trials and was a minor hit at the box office. What was it like being in the air on a bombing mission over Japan taking hits by nigh-suicidal Jap planes? What was it like to survive on a raft in the Pacific week after week? What was it like to live in a Japanese POW camp? Unbroken shows you without amping-up the melodramatics and action. This explains why some viewers call it bland and what have you. Theyre so used to Die Hard, GI JOE and 007 that movies that aim for real-life bore them. That said, I don't want to come off as a film snob because I DO understand their criticism. It just comes down to what you want out of a movie, real-life or blockbuster theatrics? So before watching this movie you have to psychologically prepare yourself for a film akin to other realistic war biographies, like 2002s The Pianist, 2006' ""Rescue Dawn"" and 2014s American Sniper. If you want Spectre you should skip Unbroken.

The movie is long enough as it is and therefore doesnt depict Louies later PTSD and alcoholism or his Billy Graham-inspired reconciliation to God, although it mentions these things in the postscript. In any case, Unbroken accomplishes precisely what it set out to do, put Louies story to film for the world to see, and it does it very well. It may not be exceptional like 1957s The Bridge on the River Kwai, but  being a biography  it never set out to compete with that film.

The film runs 137 minutes and was shot in eastern Australia.

6175905,5,B00HLTDCLM,"""Unbroken""  was a great book and a good movie.  In order to fully appreciate the story it is beneficial to indulge in both.  It was definitely a lesson in forgiveness.  The rogue Japanese guard that made life virtually unbearable for Louie Zamporini refused to meet with him when Louie flew to Japan  after the war. As a Christian, Louie wanted to forgive him but the evil guard, aka ""The Bird"", wanted nothing to do with Louie. He probably was afraid that he, himself, might get what he had coming.  After all, ""War is hell!""",1445558400,,526,4.542553191489362
6175906,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Bought this as part of a ""book to film"" project for my students.

Our school didn't have a regular copy of the book, but did have a ""young adult"" version, which I read before buying this film.

I'll say this.  The film does a good job of catching the character of Louis Zamperini as he grows up from a troubled kid into a proud, nigh unbreakable adult.

If I had one criticism, its that the film leaves out a lot of what happens at the end of the book, the parts of what happens after the ordeals Louis and the other POW's faced in Japan.  I found this to be one of the most powerful parts of the book and I was a bit disappointed that there wasn't more about it in the film, but I do understand that they couldn't possibly fit all of the book into a two hour movie, and that it would have been complicated to keep Louis as likeable a character if the audience saw what became of him when in the doldrums of PTSD.

Overall the film was pretty good.  If you're expecting a direct translation from the book, don't expect that.  There are large portions of the movie that are out of sequence from the book.
If you're expecting a powerful, engaging story, you'll find it here.",1445558400,,1172,4.200892857142857

I don't think I've ever seen a movie that was so poorly scripted, directed and produced with no creativity whatsoever. I can't believe that Angelina Jolie and the Coen Brothers (who are usually brilliant) are honestly happy with the way this turned out.

6176102,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Based on some of the reviews, I did not expect the movie to be good. I decided to get the book first and then watch the movie. I am about Chapter 8 of part 1 and, the book its great! I  have not read a book this good in a while.
I remember when the trailer came out for this movie...it didn't catch my attention. I liked that it was based on  a true story, but i did not do research the story, so i figured i watch it one day.
But i am surprised by this movie. Angelina Jolie did a great job directing it , i think this is one of reason why i was not too eager to see it, knowing an actor was directing but she did a great job. It would be imposible to put the whole book in the movie, it would last hours. But what she has on there, is basically a summary -- a well done one!
I also did not have great expectation for acting chops and, i think the acting was great, the guy who plays Loui, was great playing the part, as well as everyone else.
If you are on the sensiteve side, the torture scene are almost real, and I had to press the 10s forward button on my Ipad, so that is something to keep in mind if you are the sensitive side.
I did a lot of research on Louis Zamporini before I bought the book and watch the movie, I watched a lot of his interviews and Angelina as well. Then got the book and finally watched the movie. And i do not regret it!
It would have been nice to see a small scene about  Louis transfomation with JesusChrist, but it is a Hollywood movie, directed by Angelina who grew  up in the industry and, probably didn't want to pintpoint anything specific and remain neutral, she just wrote a note at the end ""his faith helped him forgive"".
I think she was blessed to have met a man like Louis Zamporini, and to have had the privilage to tell his story and I am glad  Louis got to see the rough cut of his life story on his last days of life.
Louis who was a man of faith the word of The Lord became real, Louis went from glory to glory (2 Corinthians 3:16-18) and though Louis beginning were humble, he went out of this earth prosperous (Job 8:7). Very inspiring story but..... the book is still better and i would recommend to read the book.",1443571200,,2167,3.995381062355658

6176155,4,B00HLTDCLM,This movie kept my interest and was well acted/produced.  I read the book prior to the movie.  I wish the movie spent a little more time on Louie's life after the war and how he went back to Japan to meet his captors and make peace.  But the main focus of the movie was the survival in the ocean and the POW experience which was great.  I think in this case it would have been better to see the movie and then read the book to fill in the missed events that the movie did not fully explain.,1443312000,,490,3.9693877551020407
6176156,3,B00HLTDCLM,"I haven't read the biography this movie is based upon, but after reading many reviews of the movie and an interview with Zamperini, I realize that Angelina Jolie missed the larger point of the book.

Trust me, Im an agnostic with little interest in stories merely about ones life being changed by faith. I know it happens and Im happy for those people. But in this case, if one is tackling the all-encompassing task of bringing this mans story to life, you are obligated to put his transformative experience with faith at the forefront. To do otherwise is to simply make another war movie, one that is too long and surprisingly superficial. Whats more, you might have done further good in using the attractive war backdrop to lure in the curious while sending them home with a powerful message of survival and spiritual growth.

The backlash to this universal, to quote Zamerpini, tone was swift and heavy-handed, with scores of conservative and Christian blogs, columns, and reviews all hitting the same bitter note. I think that what they wanted, a testament to the power of Billy Grahams message and Christianity wouldnt have made the movie better; it would have simply swung to the other extreme. What is missing are character depth, from the main character on down, as well as a broader retelling of the whole story and not just the parts during the war. We needed to know what happened after the war, and a big part of that was his conversion.

You can do such a thing without making this a would-be Christian Broadcasting Network offering, and moreover; you couldve touched on PTSD, how faith helps pull people up from the depths, and even his courageous return to Japan to offer forgiveness. Those elements wouldve made this so much more than this long, tepid, and generic war story.

Im usually a sucker for such dramas, with eyes watering and a lump in my throat by the time the credits roll. Yet, for Unbroken, I was merely glad it was over. At well over two hours and after a mind-numbing and borderline gratuitous amount of torture scenes, I had nothing left but exhaustion. Jolie chose the visceral over the spiritual, and thats a shame because Louie Zamperinis story is one of endurance, tragedy, and the power of faith and forgiveness. Sadly, those two points are reduced to a few hurried scenes and some words on screen just before the credits roll.

It's not an awful movie, but it is incomplete and a wasted opportunity to do so much more. In mirroring Zamperini's courage, Jolie could have made a film that bridged the gap between religious conservatives and Hollywood liberals without pandering to either side.",1443312000,,2631,4.7736263736263735
6176157,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Unbroken tells a *tremendous* story about perseverance, resilience and survival as the description accurately states.  The film shows us the younger days of Louis Zamperini (played by Jack O'Connell) and the difficulty he had being an unwelcomed Italian in a neighborhood where he'd get into trouble, daydream and make contact with women in churches, and find himself getting involved in fights with the kids around town only to come home and be punished by his father for misbehaving.  I had NO idea there was once a problem with Italians living in a small neighborhood.  That was news to me.

We also see the courageous years where he served in World War II battling Japanese planes in the sky and risking his life.  Talk about incredibly dangerous!  It's amazing the gunfire from the planes didn't take him out, or that he didn't slip and fall to his death.  He was *very* close to making one gigantic life-changing mistake on several occasions.  If this film is accurate in portraying his soldier experience, he could have easily been killed in a variety of different ways.  The film does a magnificent job showing us the airplane battles and Louis having flashbacks to his younger days when his brother would help bring out the best in his running talents, which turned out to be quite useful and extraordinary (extraordinary enough to make it to the Olympics!)  This movie actually has a strong ""never give up"" message.  Arguably stronger than most movies that strive the message of never giving up even when the outcome seems hopeless.

Anyway that's the first half of the movie.  The second half is where things get a LOT harder for poor Louis.  Hard to believe it gets worse isn't it?  But it does.  Soon his plane goes down in the ocean, and he finds himself floating on a raft with a couple other buddies (one played by Domhnall Gleeson) for days, learning to avoid dangerous waves and thunderstorms, praying to God for help (and making important promises to become closer to God if he survives) and eventually having to learn to fish.  How in the WORLD was he able to quickly grab a shark out of the ocean with his hands?  Is that even possible?  I also wasn't sure why the men were all throwing up after cutting a seagull open.  Maybe seagull meat is exceptionally stinky when raw, or there's some other reason.

Unfortunately for poor Louis, when he fires a flare gun into the air hoping the American plane would turn around and rescue him and his friends, it turns out it's actually a Japanese plane... and it turns around and shoots down at them much to everyone's surprise.  As if Louis hasn't already had enough problems.  So the Japaense eventually capture the men and take them to a prisoners of war camp where Louis in particular receives the worst treatment apparently because he doesn't like to make eye contact with the one Japanese soldier (played by rock musician Miyava) who goes by the name Mutsuhiro Watanabe.  Now that IS a surprise to me at least, that Miyava is playing the role of a ruthless, aggressive, merciless soldier-beating lunatic.  The way he beats, torments and humiliates Louis is significantly worse than in most Japanese World War II movies where we see people getting beat.  How about the scene where he forces the rest of the prisoners to punch Louis in the face?  That is REALLY crazy!  What an awful person.  A part of me wants to believe this is exaggerated for the purpose of telling a movie but I have a feeling it's not.  I have a feeling the real brutality of the Japanese soldiers during the war was too bad to portray in a movie.

Louis stands by his beliefs.  He won't lie and live a life of comfort, rest, food and a roof over his head just to lie and report what the Japanese want him to say over the radio to the Americans.  He's more than willing to return to war camp and persevere whatever Mutsuhiro demands.  Seriously the way Mutsuhiro smacks the American soldiers around and does it in a way where you can almost feel the pain is really hard to stomach.  He often acts like he's about ready to stop punishing only to turn around and smack them with a stick or his gun again... and again... and again.  I was like ""JUST STOP ALREADY!!!  YOU MADE YOUR POINT!!!""  Mutsuhiro has another trick up his sleeve later on.  He threatens a noticeably very exhausted Louis to hold heavy objects above his head and if he were to drop them, order the soldiers to shoot and kill Louis.  I won't spoil what happens but the writing's really good here.  And when it appears Mutsuhiro is moving to another location and thus freeing Louis from all the torture he put him through only for Louis to discover that his next prison camp destination happens to be where Mutsuhiro is continuing his soldier duty?  Tough luck.

Anyway Unbroken lives up to its name.  It's about a man who won't be broken no matter what kind of punishment the Japanese dish out.  The attention turns to Louis more so than the other soldiers as the story develops.  The story does a wonderful job detailing his Olympic running skills, his childhood hardships, trying to maintain an airplane in the middle of a battle zone, surviving for several grueling days on a raft and nearly dying of starvation and exhaustion, and dealing with the worst kind of punishment and beatings imaginable (and it reaches a point where the exhaustion *almost* becomes too much for him to tolerate, but I won't spoil in what way).  This movie is fantastic.",1443225600,,5455,4.640250260688217
6176158,5,B00HLTDCLM,"A moving, and underrated film masterfully done.  I think prejudice has lowered the deserved rating for this inspiring film.",1443225600,,123,5.473684210526316

6176160,5,B00HLTDCLM,"This film can be entered in two different ways. Through the obvious door at first bu also through the chimney then, and the chimney is always more interesting because it is the way Father Christmas favors.

The first one is the main character and his true story. There is little to say about that true story. Louis Zamperini is what we call a hero. He managed to go through and survive some absolutely unique and insane situations in which he was made to suffer for the pleasure the torturer was getting out of it, that pleasure which compensates for all the frustrations you can imagine. All torturers are simple people in everyday life but they are deeply frustrated or alienated because they could not do what they wanted to do and some others than themselves have been able to do it. They have to take some vengeance and get even with those who dared do better than they did. A sadist is always a failure who is turning his failure into success by getting even with those who were not failures, with those who had the guts to succeed while he, himself, did not have the brain to even imagine how to succeed.

But this approach of the film is not very interesting. No one admire Jesus because he accepted to suffer for us. We admire him because he managed to forgive his torturers.

The second approach is the distance this film creates with WW2. That was an event that was a long time ago and Louis himself is demonstrating that living in the spirit of the war, in the desire to come even with those whom we fought, in some vengeful way or even in some due payment for the suffering they imposed onto us, is absurd and insane.

The film shows that strength is inside and that strength dictates we forgive them afterwards and we try to stand up to them or in fact very often down to them, even if that costs us our own life because dying would be a victory since we would have forced them to sell their soul and their sanity to the devil and to absolute oblivion, human annihilation. It is this strength that enables someone who is unjustly convicted of a crime he did not commit, or of a crime that was never committed, to be strong enough to survive as long as possible and to submit to the final ordeal in dignity. Look at your executioner in the eyes and dare him to be proud of what he is doing in front of God, a committee of one thousand people from all over the world, or simply his mother and father, sister and brother, and let him have the power to tell his own brother he would do the same to him in a similar situation. Why not his father or his mother?

Thats where the film is strong. The final image of the room of the sergeant who ran away leaving behind a picture he should have cherished of himself as an infant with his father. He was not in such a hurry that he forgot it. He just let it behind because he couldn't let his father know he would have done the same thing to him if the situation had required it. He knew he was an unworthy son of his own father, that he had betrayed his faith and his hope in him. And thats the worst part of a defeat.

Apart from that level of empathy, the film is beautifully acted and poignantly set up and directed. You cannot resist some scenes because they are stronger than what you way imagine as the maximum you can decently bear. Louis Zamp carried his beam just as well as Jesus carried his cross. We all have a cross to carry and it is by carrying it we can hope to reach some remarkable level. There is no future to those who want to have it easy all along the way. I can only tell the younger people I know and who seem not to realize that their dream is after a long path of hard efforts and stiff suffering that they are confused: their future is in their hands and that will require them to soil them and to harden them and even to scar them a little. Louis Zamp shows us that simple truth with the power of an unfailing faith in what strength can bring.

Unbroken is a historical reality and lesson as to how peace now can be taken for granted now in 2015. But, this stories torture is only history now.

The many years separating those times an now have changed the world making, Japan, an allie, in the Pacific region, and Zamperini visited the Japanese Olympics carrying the eternal flame's torch. He lifted to the end of his life, making his reputation Unbroken.

The human spirit with the help of God turned the bitter post war Louis Zamparini from drunken stupor and self destructive life style and allowed him to forgive and live a rewarding life. Those things did not get told on the film, at least not as strong as they were in the book.

Even though the bulk of the story takes place in the open sea, Jolie makes it interesting and action-packed. And, of course, lets not forget the remarkable cast. Jack O'Connell is magnetic, so are supporting actors. And what a terrific portrayal of Japanese prison camps!

6176729,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Although Jack O'Connell is talented, and his personal life (as he tells it) might have been tough, I have to say I'm disappointed that an American actor, an Italian-American actor, more specifically, did not play the leading role. With the exception of Starred Up, O'Connell has been given very little dialogue in the films where he stars. I wish him well. Perhaps Mike Leigh will give him a part in a film. Leigh would probably allow O'Connell to show all his talents, and not just diet or speak with an American accent to pull off a role.

 Perhaps this film was his own redemption. He might not have been granted a visa to the U.S. otherwise.",1440460800,,645,4.551724137931035

This movie is like all of the slow parts of Saving Private Ryan scrunched together.  With flashbacks.

I am sure many people want them buried and forgotten, but younger generations should know the stories are not fiction. Mans inhumanity  to man continues to this day. We are not innocent in the acts of torture, but to see how prisoners were treated, is the best way to tell the horrible truth. I wish Japan had offered an honorable surrender before those terrible bombs were dropped on all those innocent people.  I fear that younger generations buy in to the tale that concentration camps did not exist. I have a neighbor who lived down the road from the worst of the camps, Auschwitz. She has never forgotten the horror or the smell. Angelina Jolie should have received more acclaim for telling this story. I thank her for doing so.",1439596800,,884,4.696774193548387

6177004,5,B00HLTDCLM,"This is a true story about a young Olympic gold medal winner who was drafted into the Air Force because of WW2.  His airplane was shot down by enemy fire over the Pacific. Three men, including the lead character, survived the crash into the ocean and were in rafts for an interminable length of time fighting hunger, thirst, severe sunburn, sharks and enemy aerial gunfire before they were captured by the Japanese.  They were captured and thrown into a Japanese prison camp. In spite of the pain and abuse he suffered from a jealous and brutal Japanese officer (who prior to the war had aspirations to be an Olympian), he persevered and remained strong of mind, even though his body was becoming weaker and weaker from starvation, beatings and depravation.
This movie made me cringe on more than one occasion due to the abuse that the lead character received, but his strength of character and mind is the very thing that kept him unbroken.",1439596800,,941,4.7317073170731705

The book left me in tears as I considered the years of abuse, torture, beatings and fears endured by the Allied forces and innocent civilians at the hands of the enemy, and the agony of ordinary, everyday war.  The movie was a mild, uninspiring story by comparison and did not, in my opinion, do justice to the men and women whose lives were brutally taken or those who endured and survived the horrors of WWII in the Pacific area.  The book, on the other hand, was an eye-opener and well worth the read.",1438819200,,611,4.428571428571429

I highly recommend everyone else do so, too.  Zampirini only just died recently, but he was able to watch the unedited film about his life on screen with Angelina Jolie.

Appears as though his actual actions were even more unbelievable.
Based on other reviews, I may just have to pick up the book for a more complete account of his life.

I did read the book about  2 years before seeing this movie. In this time, I must have told dozens & dozens of people about this fabulous book.
By the time I went to see the movie, as much as I liked it, it just did not equally compare to the book. This is the reason I gave the movie 4 stars. As good as it is, the book is better.

6177460,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Excellent movies about the struggles of one man's life journey to over adversity brought on by war. The acting is very believable and the direction was clear and uncluttered. I did not read the book but the friends I have that read the book said it was fairly accurate. I don't know what the controversy was about the direction by Angelina Jolie but the movie was interesting to watch, actors appeared believable, the plot plus twists and turns seemed believable. The only criticism I might have is the lack of delving into the main character's turning to God and becoming a believer and disciple of Christ. That was OK, because the movie was more about his struggles during the war and not the life he had after the war.",1437868800,,721,4.596899224806202

As I've noticed in her other movies that she has directed, she has a real skill at depicting violence, and there is plenty of it in this movie. While some of the scenes might have ran a little too long, and maybe a more experienced director could have figured out how to convey the scene without it's great length, overall I give the director at A-.",1437523200,,456,4.252873563218391

6177524,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Unbroken is a fairly interesting movie about a guy who couldn't be broken by the elements and later a sadistic warm criminal in a concentration camp.  The film doesn't spend a lot of time on his pre plane crashing into the ocean life, which is somewhat understandable being how the long ended up being.  Perhaps they could have extended the pre crash stuff a bit and lessened the lengthy raft scenes.  I actually wondered at one stage, isn't this supposed to be a POW film, when it looked like it wanted to out length the Life of Pie for drifting in an inflatable in the middle of the ocean. Contains some spoilers-  I did like how it most had realistic shark scenes, with them in the water together but not being attacked as soon as they got wet like is the Hollywood norm, but obviously there's was pressure to add a bit of shark attack action by basically photoshopping the Jaws ride from Universal studios with a shark launching itself parallel to the side of the raft for no apparent reason.

Also some spoilers - When we finally got to the POW situation it was quite well done although I'm pretty sure getting punched in the face by hundreds of men would likely do a bit more damage and leave scarring, if it is even plausible to be survivable at all. Yet his face just had a small bruise. Likewise lifting a metal bar above his head was filmed to look like it's duration went for hours, which meant I thought when watching this is obviously bs, but apparently it's in the book, but according to those who read the book it was only 37 minutes (which still very impressive, especially when malnourished and injured).

I think the act that proved he was undbroken by what he'd been forced to endure though was the forgiveness of the Japanese, meeting with his captors and running at the end of his life at the Japanese Olympics (fulfilling what he would have done if there was no World War.  Yet this wasn't filmed with actors or anything and instead just had some text over some news footage of the real Louie taking part in the torch relay.

Overall though it's a pretty good film and well worth watching.",1437523200,,2111,4.464935064935065

6177791,5,B00HLTDCLM,"The story behind the movie ""Unbroken"" is simply incredible and this movie portrays it magnificently. This is a film that inspires, offers hope to the most dire of life's situations and reveals the character of a man who refuses to give up or give in when it seemed all was lost.
Compelling and astounding.
That anyone can endure horrendous hardships, survival, brutality and live to tell the story reminds us all of the strength of the human spirit. It is a film that demonstrates courage, triumph over hatred and fear and is possibly the most compelling story I have ever read (and watched).
The movie is about war so it is not without violence and there are heart-wrenching scenes but the underling focus is endurance, courage and never giving up--against all odds. The man this film is about: Louis Zamperini is a true American hero.
I was moved to tears both regarding the book and the movie. I recommend this movie to anyone who wants to witness the triumph of the will to survive.  The movie is very well made and was directed by Angelina Jolie.",1436832000,,1051,4.650537634408602

The history of man was very interesting. In life he died not too long ago and was to have been the grand marshal of the Rose Parade. A great honor but he died months before the parade. His Family was there in his honor, very moving to see. He also attended USC and is honored on that campus. I must say this was a very good movie and a must see.",1436745600,,507,3.980392156862745

6177895,4,B00HLTDCLM,This movie is a dramatic film about the will of one man against another.  The main character is in prison.  His captor is a sick sadistic man who singles out this one prisoner for torture.  There is a psychological twist at the end of the film that is thought provoking.  How can some people be so mean.  Its not a chick flick by any means but my husband wanted to see it and we watched it together.,1436659200,,399,4.12987012987013

I had read the book and expected to be disappointed but I thought Jolie did an excellent job of telling the story and bringing this amazing story to the screen.

6177987,5,B00HLTDCLM,"A quiet - powerful story about surviving the perilous aftermath of being shot out of the sky and crashing into the ocean only to end up a prisoner war. While interred by the Japanese Army this young soldier incurs the antipathy of one of his guards. Aware this young American is an Olympic athlete the Japanese guard subjects him to physical punishment with the further intention of demoralizing and shaming his fellow POWs. Recognizing his tormentor by singling him out has made him a symbol galvanized his will to not just endure but triumph. Most of what we see is about how this particular man survived the horror of war with thousands of others. As someone who read the book -- the lengthy monotony of his suffering extra grievious bodily injury on top of multiple and on going traumas is the core of the story and told in a way that is realistic without sensationalizing the violence and depravity.

My wife had read the Hillenbrand book - which she liked a lot.  I haven't read yet; will probably wait a while befoe doing so.

As a movie, I'd say it drags on a bit long, and never becomes truly 'great.'

Interestingly, this movie made us both recall the old PBS series from the 80s, ""A Town Called Alice"" - which was based on the Nevil Shute novel.  Even though that show went several hours, it is an equally tough subject, and riveting throughout - and is possibly even better than the book.

He showed everyone how strong he was by not giving in to the abuse of his captors and showed everyone how he overcame the truma and found his faith. great movie.

6178201,4,B00HLTDCLM,"This is Jolie's fifth directorial outing, keeping in mind that total includes; one in and for post production the other uncredited.  It is an intensely authentic docudrama about the undeniably inspiring survival story of WWII crew member and Olympic champion Louis Zamperini.  The acting is superb without deviation from this relatively unknown cast.  Likewise, the sweep and scope are remarkably genuine and powerful.  But Jolie's decision to exempt the deeper aspects of Zamperini's conflict of faith and later dedication to it faith leaves a frustratingly gaping hole in her otherwise potent storytelling.  I understand the progressive pressure she was under, or maybe it was a personal choice to deviate from that element of his life.  Either way it was an error in judgment as that crucial facet played an unmistakable part in the strength and boldness of his spirit to survive such hellish ordeals.  She does broach the topic, but it is in a far too minuscule way to express the sincere impact that it provided in his real life.  It is a definitive shame, but that is Hollywood and its continuing disdain for anything that possesses solid Theology or awe inspired testimony.  Still, the film is historically accurate and intently engaging with scenes that are so disturbing and triumphant that they will never leave you.  A stark reminder of a bitter past and the men who rose above the chaos and suffering to become true heroes of both liberty and mercy.",1435622400,,1461,5.0

The best part for The Bird was how he was known to apologize to his victims, befriend them, and then beat them again. He was a lunatic and the movie made him seem too normal of a captor by comparison. In the end, The Bird fled like a coward. It would have been great to have added a segment on his leaving, how he decided to keep living versus dying with honor, becoming a poor man, etc. Also, in the life raft, one of the soldiers eats and drinks all the rations in one night. They skipped that huge betrayal. So many of the good details seemed to be left out. It's still worth watching, but I just didn't feel that this film did his story justice. OH!

6178458,5,B00HLTDCLM,"The film is based upon a true story - The Story of 'Louis Zamperini'
'Louis' (Jack O'Connell) is a member of a U.S Bomber Crew during WW2.
Early on he reflects upon his early life during which he could have taken a very different path, however his brother encouraged him
to be all that he could be, and we, if but briefly follow his journey leading to him becoming a competitor in the 5000 mtrs - Event in the
1936 Berlin Olympic Games.
The Bomber Crew are given a rescue mission during which the plane experiences engine failure they come down in the Ocean below.
There are only three survivors 'Louis' 'Phil' (Domhnall Gleeson) and 'Mac' (Finn Wittrock) seemingly stranded with little chance of
survival.
After bobbing about aimlessly in the two life-rafts surviving by catching the odd fish and collecting rain water in the Shark Infested waters
for over seven-weeks 'Louis' and 'Phil' are rescued.......but not by their own, they are picked up by a Japanese Patrol-Boat and taken as
prisoners of war.
After being submitted to brutal punishment at the hands of their captors to extract information they are taken with others to a main-land
prisoner of war camp.
The camp Commandant known as 'The Bird' runs a strict and brutally cruel regime frequently giving 'Louis' more than his fair share of his
sadistic attention.(The 'Bird' evaded punishment for war crimes and in the spirit of forgiveness was eventually pardoned by America for
his crimes)
'Louis's' determination, courage and faith and will to survive will be put through a severe test.
This is an often moving and intense film which often graphically depicts in some measure the conditions and horror of the reality's of the
Japanese Prisoner of War Camps and Work zones endured by 'Louis' and fellow prisoners during WW2.
As the allies gradually gained the upper hand in the conflict we do during a forced-march see the devastation caused by bombing on the
Japanese main-land.
'Louis Zamperini' achieved a life-long ambition to run again at an Olympics at the age of 80 as a Olympic-Torch carrier, it was the 5th time
he'd been able to do so.......he died aged 89 in December 2014.

6178551,3,B00HLTDCLM,"I just finished watching Unbroken, and let me say up front that I haven't read the biography and had never heard of Louis Zamperini before seeing this film. So all of my opinions are truly based only on what I saw in this film and the special features.

And my overall impression? Jolie only told half the story of what ""Unbroken"" meant in this man's life. That, and I don't know how Jolie managed to make the life story of one of the most fascinating people ever to have lived seem almost boring. That isn't a comment on Zamperini - it's a comment on how long, slow, and tedious this movie felt. More on that in a moment...

If you look at this as a story of physical endurance, then Jolie did a decent job of ""documenting"" the hardships that Zamperini endured early in his life. Childhood bullying, 40+ days on a life raft, the WWII prison camp - all were told with brutal honesty. There's no question that Zamperini faced some of the worst life experiences possible and against all odds he managed to survive. In that respect, the movie does a decent job of explaining that aspect of ""Unbroken.""

But that's only half the story. Jolie told the story of his physical endurance, but not the emotional or spiritual recovery. The movie ends at Zamperini's release from the prison camp. She left out what came next - overcoming severe PTSD, alcoholism, finding forgiveness for his captors, passing on his legacy to the next generation of troubled youth. Zamperini's ENTIRE life is a testament to what it truly means to be ""Unbroken. It's almost as though in telling this story, Jolie missed the forest for the trees.

And, quite frankly, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Jolie obviously wanted to celebrate Zamperini's survival against all odds, but she didn't want to deal with the difficult and messy aftermath that comes with PTSD. By ignoring the emotional and spiritual battle he fought - and won - later in his life, she treated Zamperini exactly how soldiers are too often treated in this country. As a society, we understand physical trauma and are ready to help. But ANY form of mental or emotional trauma still has a stigma attached to it. Jolie was more than happy to spend over an hour showing Zamperini repeatedly being beaten, but she turned a blind eye to the equally important, and equally devastating, emotional aftermath that he dealt with later in life. In doing so, Jolie missed a HUGE opportunity to really portray what ""unbroken"" means, and instead sent the message that surviving a beating was this man's greatest accomplishment. She also missed an opportunity to pay a REAL tribute to soldiers and war heroes for every aspect of what they endure - physical AND emotional. She easily could have structured this movie to flash back through Zamperini's entire life, but she deliberately chose not to.

And...as I said above, this was an extremely long movie, and it didn't help that the movie was filled with long, drawn out camera sequences. I was sorely tempted to fast forward many, many times in this film. It's a shame, actually, because the acting was top-notch. Jack O'Connell did a masterful job of portraying Zamperini's suffering, and the scene with the wooden beam brought me to tears. The CGI and special effects are also extremely well done, and as a period piece it's phenomenal.

It's a shame, but I really think Jolie's direction ruined this movie. Zamperini's life story is one of the most inspiring things I have ever seen, and obviously they had the budget to make a first-class WWII period piece. But somehow it just fell flat for me, and after seeing the documentaries I was actually angry at how wrong this movie felt. I was more appalled at what she chose to leave out than what she actually put in the film. Lots of 1-star reviews say to read the book instead, and after seeing Zamperini and his family talk about his life, I can certainly see why.

Could easily have been a 5-star movie in more experienced hands. It's certainly worth seeing, but not one I will be buying. Don't skip the special features - those are far more informative and inspiring than anything in the movie.",1434412800,,4123,4.6786206896551725

The life scenes roof young Louie shows how, with his brother's encouragement, Louie grows from an angry young boy into a strong and determined man. These scenes together with those of his wartime struggles, gives the viewer insight into what made him a real life hero.",1433980800,,328,4.771929824561403
6178675,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Unfortunately I have not read the book, which I should because the novel is always more detailed than the film adaptation, but if I read the book and watch the movie, I might be disappointed, as some directors do not follow the novel to which they should to make a script. Anyway, I thought it was a great movie, all should take the simple, but wise words of ""if you can take it, you can make it"" and apply it to our lives. Although this business of P.O.W. is extreme for civilians, I mean being brave when facing decisions to make in life, taking risks, and not be afraid to live. Louie Zamperini, once an emotionally distant, troubled young boy, confused about how to go about his life, in a world of being made to feel, like he was nothing, didn't fit in, was made to look @ his image from a different stand-point, by his older brother, who did see something in him, most never had..perseverance, and unrelenting nerve. As a result he joins the track team, and then trains to run in the Olympics. He makes his way to the 1936 Olympics in what is now developing, into Nazi Germany. He brings home the gold from Germany, and is expected to head to the next event in Tokyo Japan...but WW2 brings that hope to an end. He and 2 other crew men, survive a nearing fatal plane crash which lands them right in the middle of the Pacific ocean. They survived for 47 days only to be rescued by enemy (Japan) navy soldiers and held in a prisoner of war camp. It's a great defiant, human spirit movie.",1433980800,,1490,4.325

All the documentaries about this bit of history insist that the POWs had to have friendship in order to survive.  Jolie managed to remove all trace of emotion in the POWs, no friendship, no mutual aid.  The most emotion you see is from the Japanese in charge, and it is all hate and brutality.  Jolie also left out all reference to the hero's faith, which, if you read the book, is what helped him survive.  Two stars for correctly costuming.

Reading the book afterwards will expand a story that is essentially a long episode of a larger story (his early life, and most importantly, his life after returning home). The lengthy time at sea in the survival raft cannot be appreciated in a single film. The book gives a much better account of how long the ordeal went on, from the crash, the time at sea, and the prison CAMPS (not just the one in the film).

6178811,1,B00HLTDCLM,"Get the original book by Z himself, DEVIL AT MY HEELS.  NOT any PC, watered-down, filtered later versions of the story, or books by second-hand authors.
This film, which easily could have been an all-time classic for the ages, instead, turns out to be a typical Hollywood PC agenda fluff piece, which does not even represent 1 percent of the true drama, toughness, patriotism, strength of character, and suffering in the book.
I was extraordinarily disappointed.  Extraordinarily (which I reserve for only THE most disappointing films).
The crash is not accurate, according to Z in his book, which was caused by a crew member flight engineer mistakenly feathering the 2nd engine, instead of the bad one.  The plane COULD fly with only one engine out.  Whats-her-name does not even portray the beatings for ""bowing"" infractions?  A  movie like this needs exposition, narrative explanation (or some type) of what is going on in the larger war.
I could easily write a better script, from Z's book alone.  Maybe future generations will get THAT movie, as it should be done, for OUR people.
He met Hitler and shook his hand.  Z must have been one of the very last people alive, who had done so.  You mean the film did not even depict this?  Horribly PC filtered to the point that all of the real-life drama is taken out.",1433808000,,1315,4.753303964757709

The ending was too abrupt and didn't share the life challenges Louis had after war along with coming to grips with the Lord when he went to a Billy Graham Crusade.

Laura Hillenbrand's Unbroken is one of the best works of nonfiction that I've ever read...bar none!  It just wasn't done well when made into a movie.  Hillenbrand's Seabiscuit was a far more compelling movie.,1433721600,,291,5.041666666666667

6179465,3,B00HLTDCLM,"It's a sad cliche about the movie not being as good as the movie but this is a very good example of what they were talking about with this film. The book tells the story of a very complex human being who overcame tremendous obstacles in his life.  The movie cherry picks some of them to make a palatable Hollywood blockbuster.  I disliked how the impish youth of Zamprini was downplayed and he was reduced to basically being a spectator in his own life.  Also the abject brutality of the Japanese was reduced in my opinion so that it's global appeal could be greater.  A very compelling story was sacrificed to make a blockbuster.

The book is much, much better!",1432771200,,662,4.483333333333333

I'd suggest watching the movie first before reading the book so you can get a small snapshot of the book then get the big picture through the book. Overall the move wasn't bad. I would have liked to see more of his life before his plane crashed as that draws the character and why he was so resistant to the Bird. Also seeing how he and Pete were the longest men had ever been stranded at sea and survived for the time, it would have been nice to see more detail with his time at sea, seeing how probably 25% of the book covers it. I would have liked to see more of his life after the war also because he was very resentful and attempted to hunt down the bird and how he dealt with that. POW's would have appreciated that.",1432771200,,863,4.142857142857143

It is never truly fair to compare movies to books, but in the end this one does ultimately miss the point - Zamperini was in fact broken by his experiences during WW II. After returning to the U.S. he married, then alcohol and his own nightmares and personal demons began to destroy his life. The story of him being redeemed from that mess is what makes the book so wonderful. Jolie left this to a few postscripts at the end of the movie.

6179591,5,B00HLTDCLM,"I just finished watching this movie and was unfamiliar with the story of Louie Zamperini , not having read the book beforehand as I often do when watching a film based on real live events .
The acting in this movie is truly incredible . Jack O'Connell deserved an Oscar for his portrayal of Zamperini , who ran in the Olympics and was a war hero who suffered much abuse and endured many hardships so that the other prisoners were not punished .
I will warn you that much of the film is very graphic and not for the faint of heart but I believe it accurately portrays the horrendous conditions  of POW's .
You will share the heartbreak and be silently cheering for Louie throughout the film . This film has inspired me to go out and read the book now because , although the movie was riveting , there is only so much you can capture on film . I would like to learn more about the background of such a man who had such courage and heart and survived and was able to forgive .
I could also relate to this because a dear neighbor who lived next to me for 30 years was a POW in WW II and was one of the kindest and most generous men I ever met - it always amazed me how he had such a giving and forgiving attitude in spite of the atrocities he suffered .
This film is one you will not forget for a very long time .",1432166400,,1309,4.015325670498084

have possibly done the things that they did to Jews and other non-Aryans in their country...It happened...

It depicts the endurance, courage, bravery of Louie Zemperini a kid on his way to become a nobody to a true hero In high school, college and in our armed forces. Those of you who don't even know the meaning of war or conflict and on top being taken as POW for those ignorant it means Prisoner Of War being treated under the worst unimaginable inhumane  conditions shame on you for being such ignorants. Read and learn some history. All Armed Forces regardless color, creed, etc deserve our respect and our thanks wether served in the Revolutionary War, War of 1812, Spanish-American War, WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, Grenada, Haiti, Panama, Afghanistan, Iraq and any other I have missed. Thank you US Armed Forces. Rest in peace Louie Zemperini and the hundreds of thousands soldiers that never came back.

I'll sit through most any movie simply for the amusement.  After the first 20 minutes I fast forwarded virtually every thirty seconds (...all the way to the bitter end) and am positive I did not miss a thing.  Too bad a story of such incredible human growth, fortitude, stamina and integrity should be stripped of all its vitality.

6179815,2,B00HLTDCLM,"An emotional thrillride about the hardships of one man's life and the blight between two countries stuck in the bloody conflict of World War 2.  However, the magic of Hollywood cannot be overlooked.  The over-intensified, seemingly exaggerated moments of the historically accurate protagonist are all too present throughout the movie.  Jack O'Connell is the good guy; he does nothing wrong, but gets punished anyways for his ""unbroken"" spirit he developes with age.

The sheer amount and magnitude of the main character's obstacles appear as though they had happened to seperate people and were described in such a way as to be more impressive and less believable.  Although I have not taken the time to check the historic accuracy of the film and do not wish to discredit any of those who fought for our country, but this movie did not do a very good job at making me believe that this was base solely on actual events.  With accuracy aside, many of the emotional moments, which there are a lot of, may appear very over-played or over-polished.  Throughout the movie I found some very enjoyable moments, but slow and awkward scenes dragged out for much longer than the good ones, ultimately making me feel unsatisfied and bored.",1431820800,,1229,4.908212560386473

6179965,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Angelina Jolie is more than a pretty face; she's a competent actress when the role and director are right, a savvy businesswoman, a sincere humanitarian, a brave example in proactive women's health, and an artist who frequently challenges herself rather than coasting on her bone structure which has led her into the freakishly hard role of director.

""Unbroken"" is a story worth reading and a movie worth making. However, despite Jolie's sincerest effort, she was simply not equipped to create the appropriate tone.

Her film is a slick parade of hairless male models posing beautifully in soft light. She presents these men in a manner more suitable to strong women fighting battles for dignity in the workplace.

The central dynamic between Zamperini and his Japanese tormenter is clouded with heavy-handed homoerotic desire as the only detectable motive for the sadism lashed out upon the protagonist. And casting a lithe Japanese actor of ambiguous gender with a jarring resemblance to Sigourney Weaver only makes things worse.

Jolie has my respect a strong woman who understands powerful femininity and it's judo, but unfortunately her expertise simply doesn't work when applied to the strong masculine experience. Feminine finesse, sensuality, & silent body language is a complete mismatch for believable 1940s men in the raw, vengeful world of combat and prison. It doesn't have the slightest whiff of the sloppy havoc and testosterone surging survival drive that the story requires to sell it as reality.

I admire Jolie for finally bringing this tale to the screen, but read the book (5 stars) and skip this movie (1 star).",1431475200,,1634,5.174242424242424

Also two random details that annoyed me:
The gnocci he describes his grandmother making isn't classic gnocci as it lacks any potato base.
For some reason all the CG sharks with the exception of one appear to be whites (possibly Makos) which really aren't that common of a shark.

There are a lot of better ways to spend 2+ hours, and plenty of much better films.  I'm not actively unhappy that I watched it, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",1431475200,,557,4.485148514851486
6179971,4,B00HLTDCLM,"I love biopics and true stories, but frankly I found the documentary bonus feature about the real Louis Zamperini way more interesting than the actual film which gave only little insight to what was going on in the characters' minds, this is one of the cases where I believe voice-over narration (e.g. THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION) would have helped to tell the story. While the film illustrates the agony of being adrift on a raft and next imprisoned in a Japanese POW detention camp, I couldn't help but think that ALL IS LOST and Sir David Lean's BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI did this in a better fashion (with the latter apparently being the reason why the film hadn't been made already 50 years ago).

On the other hand, this is another Blu-ray title where Dolby Atmos for the home shines and illustrates why the sound design had been nominated for the Academy Awards. Right from the start the immersive Dolby Atmos 3D sound puts you in the B-24 bomber and in the middle of the action: Anti-aircraft fire from below rocks the plane, Japanese Zero fighter planes come so close you actually think you can touch them and several other scenes later on that feature planes flying overhead, drowning, a thunderstorm on the open ocean, jungle rain and other acoustic scenery make you believe you are actually there.",1431475200,4,1307,4.732456140350878

6180058,5,B00HLTDCLM,"This movie didn't get the greatest of reviews when it was originally released into the theaters. A bunch of vague griping about how the movie was too distant, not as emotionally engaging as it should be. Whatever. I still don't know what they were talking about. The lead protaganist in this film goes through the worst possible hell imaginable (plane crash, lost at sea for 47 days, Japanese prisoner of war for over 2 years and so on), and it seems to me that just the THOUGHT of that should be enough to make anyone cringe. How much in-your-face does the movie have to get? I walked out of the movie emotionally exhausted.

But it got some good reviews, too. Even if it hadn't, I would have gone to see it. I was very curious as to what a woman would do with this type of material (gritty W.W. II story). And that woman, Angelina Jolie, the co-producer and director of this film, came up with one of the best war flicks I've ever seen.

This movie is the total package. Lighting by Roger Deakins (Fargo, Shawshank Redemption). Terrifically creative camera angles by Jolie. Great sets, period details. And some really powerful acting by a bunch of actors I'd never heard of, including this Jack O'Connell fellow that played the lead role (hopefully in the future we'll be seeing a lot more of him on the big screen).",1431302400,,1318,4.533613445378151
6180059,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Amazing true story of one man's survival against the odds.  Most people would consider themselves lucky to have survived a plane crash into the ocean and floating adrift in the ocean for 47 days.  Others would consider it a miracle if they survived being a POW in Japan during World War II.  Still others would love to say that they were an Olympic athlete.  Louis Zamperini could say all three.  This movie is an amazing testament to a man who survived unspeakable hardships.  It is not a feel-good movie as he endures unspeakable abuse at the hands of his Japanese captors, but it is not overly graphic either.  A phenomenal directorial debut by Angelina Jolie-Pitt with beautiful cinematography.  Zamperini's fortitude is inspiring and unforgettable.",1431302400,,753,5.016129032258065

I also want to give Angelina Jolie a thumbs up. A director can make a great story either great or dismal on the screen just by putting their slant on the story. Angelina Jolie told the story the way it should of been, let it be the true story with just facts and add no Hollywood twist to it. She thus made it a great story into a great movie.

6180095,2,B00HLTDCLM,"Un  nec  ess  ar  ily  sloooooooow  telling of what might otherwise have been a decent film. I LOVE a good World War II Movie, but - SPOILER ALERT?: Once we are past his air adventures, it grinds down to a near halt. I gave up some 45 minutes in.

As always, this loses a star for using CGI at all - but it's over the top and disrespectful use for portraying the heroic B-24 Liberator is downright shameful.

This movie retains one star for it's pro-Christian stance, but that's about it - If I could give ZERO stars to begin with, it would get one for that much.

Before you comment, understand please: This is MY review. My opinion regarding the use of CGI in film has not changed in 30 years - it's not going to change today, for or because of something you or anyone else may try to point out. If practical effects are harder to do, too dangerous to do, too expensive to do - more than they are worth... write around the scene or do the WHOLE thing as a book - simple. If for no other reason, all the wonderful, talented, FX people, model makers and set designers the industry was once known for, may never work again...that's just not right - Sadly, those skills may well end up forever lost. For instance, MUCH of what was generated by CGI in this movie could have been, and SHOULD have been filmed with miniatures and/or hand drawn and painted , frame by frame.",1431129600,,1368,4.271317829457364

6180111,1,B00HLTDCLM,"It is a pity that Unbroken already has been fiercely attacked by Japanese rightists, who think this Hollywood flick is anti-Japanese. The film starts ominously with the line ""An unbelievable true story"", accompanied by an overwhelming mix of Wagnerian copper and kettle and Angelic voices. The film is too long, 137 minutes. I had managed to watch the first 75 minutes when I called it a day. With all respects for the fact that it is based upon a true story, the film has become a soap for me. That is why I will wait another week before watching the second half.

The first half shows the atrocities of war and the cruelty of nature. The men are pictured as heroes who have a childish pleasure in throwing bombs (""Wow, it is lit like Xmas""). They are pictured as glorified champions when they establish the world-record of 47 days spending on a raft in the ocean. Although they have come back completely to nature, every day and night has become a cruel torture. Fortunately, there was at last one short scene that gave me goose bones: the shadow of a ship floats over their scorched bodies and they are rescued from a certain death.

Understandingly, it was the enemy who had saved their lives, and would treat them as prisoners of war. This treatment is the theme of the second half of the film, good for 1 hour. It is this shorter part of the film, not yet seen by me, which had triggered protest of rightist Japanese. I wonder if they have seen the movie. When I consider the glimpse that I had caught of the infamous Watanabe, I wonder how this character could be representative for soliciting serious protests. The director has failed to keep a certain distance and instantly presented him as a lunatic sadist. This exaggeration fits well in a soap or cartoon, but does not match reality.  Film directors are free to make their own choice. But the audience is equally free to appreciate their product. I wonder why the ambassador of peace has had the bad taste to treat this precious material as a soap. Partially the brothers Coen as scriptwriters might be blamed for this.

While watching I had reminiscences of what I considered really good films: The loneliness of the long distance runner (1962) by Tony Richardson and The life of Pi (2012) by Ang Lee. Both are based upon literature and both deserve a 4 or 5 stars qualification. In contrast, a really good book like Fateless, an autobiographical novel by Nobel Prize winner Imre Kertsz, was turned into an inferior film by Lajos Koltai in 2005. Although overall highly rated, that film lacked the subtle humanity of the novel and was sometimes even the opposite of what the novel tried to express. The only guarantee for a true story to become a good movie, is the combined efforts of director and audience to share good taste.

The worldview in this soap hinges upon christian doctrine (afterlife and forgiveness), which is not shared by a Japanese audience. If not for the angry protests, this film would have passed unnoticed in Japan. When it comes to money, this film will not become a box-office hit. Some may have seen the magisterial Korean film Secret Sunshine by Chan-dong Lee (2007), which had not been a box-office hit in USA. Although the theme of that movie was rather anti-christian, it did not ignite American Christians. It was ignorantly ignored. Unbroken, as a soap, deserves the same fate.",1431129600,,3374,4.682967959527825

  I find it incredible that so many people took the time to write in and it pick the writer's words and those that created the movie also.
If you are a Veteran you know what he accomplished does not get splashed onto and into a book and movie with out going through a tremendous amount of people doing all they can to discredit his actions he made for his Brothers in war.

I as a proud combat wounded Vietnam Veteran am also so proud of the Millions of men and women who have served our Great Country and are now serving it.
 Serving it not for money but to preserve the Freedoms and Preservation of of these basic issues so many people take for granted....

I read the book and saw the movie, as always a movie can seldom bring to your mind what a writer is trying to bring to your mind about the writing and work they have done to preserve millions of Heroes like Louis.

I can appreciate the fact that it is impossible to film everything recorded in a lengthy biography like Unbroken, but nevertheless I thought the movie was a huge disappointment.  Jolie (the director) could have cut the time spent in rafts after the plane's crash by half and not lost anything.  Anyone who has not read the book would have a difficult time making much sense out of events in the prison camp.  All in all, I would say Angelina Jolie's ability as a director is comparable to her ability as an actor.

6180153,2,B00HLTDCLM,"There has to be more of a story or a more developed screenplay to make this noble, but failed, effort work. This is essentially a genre I would called ""Insprirational Procedural"" as it simply recounts the steps of a life that was a testament to faith and endurance but it has no depth in its human interactions, no complexity in its central portrait. The best tales of faith involve some sort of personal journey of discovery, a testing of faith that is rooted in one's own psychology and experience of the world. This is a psychology-free zone, where people are physically crushed but aren't vanquished, which is the opposite of enlightenment. It's endurance, which is possible for trees and animals, not the exclusive domain of humans. So if you want to watch a rock NOT be washed down by the sea, this is for you. If you're looking for an exploration of a human soul facing demons from within and growing in depth and complexity by life's challenges, I'd suggest a Bresson or Olmi film.

The movie was a disappointment in that the most amazing element about this man's story is the hate he felt after the war that totally consumed him and how he came full circle to be able to forgive and not just move on with his life, but dedicate it to trying to make other peoples lives better.  The movie did a good job of showing how the personal conviction to not give up or trade out your principles can save you and take you through even the worst imaginable circumstances whcih he certainly endured.",1430956800,,552,4.349514563106796

6180246,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Excellent movie with a feel good ending. The combat scenes were portrayed well, showing the desensitization that takes place as a result of violence and death as a fact of war. My only criticism is that the fate of individual characters is too easily predicted by their stereotypical personality: the airman who doesn't have a positive outlook in the face of their dire circumstances, played by Finn Wittrock, is the man who perishes. Whereas, the main character, played by Jack O'Connell, who is demonstrably positive and brave, continues to push through and survive. Like the combat scenes, the environment at the POW work camp shows appropriately harsh living conditions. The most impressive performance is newcomer Miyavi's portrayal of  Imperial Japanese Army sergeant Mutsuhiro Watanabe, a man you actually begin to hate. His behavior embodies not just a character leading the enemy, but actually depicts the nuances in personality of a man taking his anger and emotional pain out on prisoners incapable of fighting back. The movie ends with the real Louis Zamperini returning to Japan to run in the Olympics, his lifelong dream. While the ultimate message of forgiveness may be taking the higher moral ground, it is noteworthy to mention that this moral lesson is much easier to swallow now that there are few survivors remaining from World War II. The vast majority of viewers can relate to this event only through the memories of proxy relatives or by studying history, and these generations removed from the torture and violence make it much easier to objectively evaluate the pain and suffering that was not experienced personally.",1430956800,,1642,5.149812734082397

The movie followed the story line of the book adequately (as well as any movie can follow a great book) up to a point.  The best part of Mr. Zamporini's story is that he accepted Christ as his Savior at a Billy Graham revival meeting and later gave all he had to serving God and young men who needed his help.  I have heard the reasons that part was left out of the story from his son, but it is still the best part of the story.  Both Laura Hildenbrand's book and Louis's own auto-biography were excellent reading and the movie helped bring his story to this cinematic format that was well done.",1430870400,,700,4.312977099236641

Two: In all of the torture Louie went through, he endured it without allowing the anger or pain turn his heart bitter Three: He forgaveinstead of seeking revenge.  This movie has really inspired me and motivated me to stop complaining and whining about the trivial day to day offenses/troubles of life and work on having a better outlook and attitude.

It is based on a true story and Iove that they introduce us to who the man really is at the end and gave some material conclusions - very nice.

What I truly liked a lot is how a journey from start to finish was followed to show proof that humans can reach extreme limits of endurance and resilience. It is never about being physically the strongest person in the bunch but rather having a high mental capacity for stress, pain, agony, etc.",1430524800,,494,4.189473684210526

6180428,5,B00HLTDCLM,"If you can take it, you can make it. What a profound lesson for all the struggles of human life, specially in this day and age. Beaten, starved, left for dead, lost at sea, forgotten by the rest of the world and still lives to be nearly 100 years old, with a smile on his face. Wow, I thought this was just gonna be another Americanized propaganda movie, celebrating war. Much deeper than that. Very important film for me personally. Kind of makes my own back breaking days of hard work, emotional distress and environmental challenges easy in comparison. After gaining perspective from this film, I have nothing to complain about. I thought I had it bad? What about the lost generation of slaving men who worked tirelessly under the burning sun to help build the world we have today. My ancestors were on the front lines and now generations later, here I am. Kind of humble's me to shut up and get on with it. Take it and make it. Its that simple. I cant even begin to praise this film. Un exectedly love it. Almost wrote it off before watching.",1430524800,,1046,4.453125
6180429,3,B00HLTDCLM,"I watched the movie Unbroken on DVD Friday night. It was a good movie as far as movies go, but did not do justice to the book. The book was about Louie Zamperini, his home life, his Olympic experiences, his change of heart and how his faith in God sustained him through captivity in a Japanese prisoner of war camp. It was also about how different members of his family and community prayed for him and how his mother and sister never gave up hope that he was alive. The book recounts their efforts to get information from the State Department about his whereabouts. It includes his struggles with PTSD after the war and his testimony and witness for the Lord Jesus Christ. The movie is just OK. It would have been better if we had had a glimpse into Louie's soul. If you want the whole truth, read the book.",1430524800,,808,4.357615894039735

The book was incredible because it focused on how this man lifted himself up from nothing and against the odds and tremendous adversity and rose to triumph over it all.

The story is great, the guy went through and did so much in his life: from growing up in a poor immigrant family to becoming an Olympian, to surviving being shot down in an warplane over the Pacific and then onto a Japanese POW camp. His story is certainly inspiring and amazing to see on the screen. I feel that Angelina Jolie did a fine job in portraying the man, the way she shot the film was very well done and I hope to see more movies by her in the future.

6180697,1,B00HLTDCLM,"Although I'm enjoying the book. trying to watch the movie via my Fire HD was an exercise in futility.  After trying for two days to download and watch the movie from a forward operating base in Afghanistan I finally  gave up... but still paid for the privilege of seeing a few fleeting seconds of the movie.  My ONE STAR rating is not a reflection on the movie -- if it's half as good as the book, it's a winner --  but rather an indictment of a frustratingly slow download speed over many hours of Internet connectivity.  I assume this drawback is not a problem for most Americans at home... at least I hope not..",1430352000,,614,4.350877192982456

6180798,5,B00HLTDCLM,"I know any movie will get a bad review after one has read the book, but this was particularly deficient of key details that truly make this a great story. Honestly, I'm no fan of the Coen brothers and they seriously failed in writing this script. If only this was a sequential story, it would have been easier to track. The real story that was missing in this piece was how a child could persevere past bullying and find a strength that would payoff in his future.

6180886,3,B00HLTDCLM,"There's nothing ""wrong"" with this movie, and the story of Louis Zamperini is certainly inspiring. The issue is that it's just not the kind of book that makes for a very exciting movie.  Basically, he's either suffering on a raft or suffering in a prison camp the entire movie. Yes, the movie omits his religious awakening after the war, but again, even that would not have made for very entertaining cinema. If you've read the book, it's fun to see aspects of it brought to life.  But if you're expecting a great war movie, or tons of action, look elsewhere.",1430265600,,558,4.57

I have not read the book which I understand is great, but, to me, the film was just one scene of suffering after another with very little examination of feelings and consequences.

To be more complete, the movie would be hours longer. In the case of the modern generation of film viewers this would have been a Hollywood ""flop"" had the producer/ director tried to tell more. I took my thirteen year old granddaughter to see it at her request..she had not read the book, but had seen reviews of the story. She sat completely absorbed in the film and was aware of what the history behind the story was as well as the beauty of the unbroken human spirit it conveyed, and decided to read the book as a result! So, the method used by the film company and crew was a success. From the thousands of reviews on this web site, I see most people approve of the methods used. I'm inspired by the story, but even more so by the reactions in young viewers today such as my grand kid! So, praises to the storytellers...
 However, as a retired history educator with a special interest in military aviation, I was put off by the errors in the military technology present in the film. For the most part, the computer generated B-24 sequences are exciting and look accurate externally....but inside the aircraft there is a fantasy world...super spacious aircraft interiors, noise levels such that normal talking is possible, etc. Not on a combat mission. Take a ride in one of the restored WW II bombers today and you'll see what I mean...and there is nobody shooting machine guns inside the airplanes and no flak bursting outside. Sure, liberties for the sake of the film and plot. But then take a look at the equipment and uniforms provided by the props and costume departments...that could and should have been better portrayed. Flight crews in WWII wore heavy flight gear to combat cold at altitude..even in the Pacific. The gear also protected the crew from being banged up in the crowded, blunt and/or sharp edges in the tight interiors. Crewmen wore parachute harnesses 100 % of the time...they did not put the harness on in an emergency escape situation. The parachute pack yes. And ditto to the life preservers...worn all the time, under that harness...not hung up until an emergency. And gloves, and even armored flack suits and helmets at times. Those were the technical omissions/errors that bothered me...but I'm a nit picker about such stuff!
None of that detracted from the power of the story...it just nagged me!",1430179200,,2528,4.693693693693693

6180924,2,B00HLTDCLM,"Only Hollywood could take a great story,  a great American hero and reduce them to creased uniforms, white teeth, neatly trimmed goat tees, stylish haircuts and clean shaven characters. According to the book, Chapters 14 and 16 the characters had beards. lice and rags as uniforms, which contradicts the film's version! The Japanese NCO(The Bird) looked more child like than an NCO in the Imperial Japanese Army. In the camp, the British and Australian hats looked new and fresh, rather than dirty and battered. The total break down of the Bird falling to his knees, would not have happened in public.
In short, save your money and read the book, which you can not put down. The book is a real testament  to Louis Zamperini and the human spirit!!",1430179200,,746,4.775193798449612

It tells a true story (although probably dramatized is some areas, and possibly downplayed in others) of an amazing individual.

The drifting at sea thing.....mind numbing. Some of the scenes in the camp could have easily been omitted or trimmed down. The story is without a doubt an amazing one. I watched this in the theatres, I can promise you I did like it but will never watch it again. Too long. Not Sure why Angelina made it into an EPIC but.......Jack O'Connell and the Japanese Commandant were terrific.

Unfortunately, Jolie is not well enough acquainted with the WWII attitude and situations depicted in this story and the places it took her.  She is not equipped to deal with the emotion, the passion, the horror perpetrated upon American prisoners while in concentration and/or prisoner of war camps.  I lived during those times, and Jolie fails at what could  have been a great movie IF it had been directed by someone with more understanding of the times and the war itself.  SHE FAILED at this, which was to have been a true accounting of this mans horrific experience while a prisoner of the japanese.  The book is much better, and the movie did not do the book justice OR this man's experience. Too bad, but it happens when 'ego' gets in the way of 'talent'.

6180976,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Based on the true story of Louis Zamperini who spends 47 days in a raft with two fellow crewmen before he's caught by the Japanese navy and sent to a prisoner-of-war camp.

Although some criticism I have seen of this movie is that is leaves some parts of the book out and granted that is true but what true story movie doesnt really.  The one sign of a good movie to me is one that makes you want to go back and read the book or learn more about the true story that this is based.  This is that kind of movie.  One that drew me in and made me want to learn more about the amazing heart and heroism of this man. The movie is well done and acted very beautifully by OConnell.  The raft scenes are amazingly done and the story is told in an way that kept me interested all the way through without noticing its 140 minute run time.  I almost feel this could have been longer to get more of the story told and if it was, I would have sat and watched another hour or so.  To me it is that good and one that makes me go read the book.

I would have been really disappointed if Louie's faith wasn't at least mentioned. No, he wasn't broken during the war, but certainly was after the war. Long before PTSD became a household word. Not likely that a movie would have been made for him if that's where his story stopped. His faith was what saved him, in more ways than one. I wasn't expecting it to be a gospel film, but I was also hoping that the political correctness wouldn't blot it out completely. It's only a small part of the movie, mostly in text at the end, but enough to make me happy.

It brings out some of the real horrors of war and of mankind. There are monsters among us and we usually have no idea. There are angels, too. Hopefully movies like this will remind us of the latter.",1429833600,,942,4.346590909090909

6181157,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Early last year I made a bold statement that Angelina Jolies Unbroken would sweep the Oscars.  I held onto that faith, that stance, for pretty much the entire year until the film was released, the reviews were tepid and Awards Season was in full swing.  It then became obvious that Unbroken wasn't going to come close to winning a single Oscar, even though it managed to snag three nominations.  I had yet to see the film, and so I was under the impression that Jolie crafted an inadequate film.  It all struck me as odd, since so many of the films facets seemed tailor made for Oscar (Jolie, Coens, Desplat, Deakins) and yet so many warned me that it was too on the nose for Oscar and that it would fail.

Failed Oscar bait is what they call this kind of thing.

Well, Ive finally seen the film, and I can honestly say, no bias aside, that the Oscar snubbery baffles me.  What Jolie did here was construct a handsomely mounted biopic that carries with it a tremendous story of courage, strength and perseverance, covers a large portion of one mans life, inspires, uplifts and pretty much checks off every single requirement for Oscar voters.  The fact that this was not wholly embraced by Oscar literally baffles me.  It makes no sense, for it is everything they love.

You know, except the fact that it was made by a woman.

Im not going to get on a soapbox here, so Ill leave it here, but I will say that Jolies film has more heart, more technical bravado and more depth than The Theory of Everything, Boyhood and The Imitation Game, and so seeing this snubbed so staunchly, while those films were embraced across the board, really causes me to pause and question the way that the Academy thinks.  The accusations of sexism were swarming after AMPAS snubbed DuVernay and Flynn, and I got in on that, but this is yet another example of a film that played right into their hands and they completely ignored it, shunned it almost, without just cause.

Coincidence?

Now, Im not saying that Unbroken is perfect.  Im not even saying that Id personally nominate it in many places (I mean, those sound nominations were justly deserved, so maybe there), but what Im saying is that the criticisms heaped onto the film feel oddly places and undeserved here.

The film tells the true story of Louis Zamperini, a wayward Italian American who finally gained his footing in society when his brother convinced him to join the track team.  He had a knack for running away.  And so, with dedication and fervor, he made his way into the Olympics, breaking records and making a name for himself, until he found himself in a fighter plane during WWII, spiraling towards the ocean.  Floating for days in a raft (47 to be exact), Zamperini and his friend, Phil, were as good as dead until they were captured by the Japanese Navy and thus became prisoners of war.  Zamperini immediately became singled out by a tyrant known as The Bird, a cruel young man with daddy issues who took out his frustrations and feelings of inadequacy and weakness on Zamperini for years.

This mans story is incredible.

Jolies direction is steady, focused and relentless.  Watching scene after scene of Zamperinis torture at the hands of a wicked, wicked man can be hard to stomach, and yet the way that Deakins frames the film (yes, some shots call to mind his other work) and the way that Jolie moves from scene to scene help establish a true sense of honesty about what shes doing here.  There is no schmaltzy sentiment, which I admired, but really a sense of earned sympathy as we watch Zamperini grow as a man despite his situation.  A lot of this is thanks to the masterful way in which Jack OConnell handles this performance.  He had such a tremendous year, and quite honestly this performance is far better than the one that won the Oscar.

My only real issues with the film are the flashback scenes, for some of them are ill-timed, and I do wish that the narrative had been more chronological instead of starting us in the middle of his story and then continually going back.  I do wish the sweeping epics of the 70s and 80s.  If only Unbroken could have been another hour in length, taking a play from the Sergio Leone handbook and given us a Once Upon a Time in America feel, then this would have been a modern-day masterpiece.

Masterpiece, this is not, but what this is, is a VERY good movie that succeeds in making Louis Zamperini a real man, a living breathing human being, and tells us a story that shouldnt be missed.  I have no good explanation for why AMPAS turned their noses up at Unbroken, but maybe that says it all.",1429833600,,4599,4.538181818181818

6181212,1,B00HLTDCLM,"TERRIBLE!!! Many others have posted thoughts similar to mine... Veterans (especially POW's) of our last wars have had *terrific* problems coping with their wartime experiences. Just surviving the experiences as it occurred was the greatest challenge. The entire psychological burden/challenge of enduring the mental and physical tortures beset upon them is harrowing.

ALL of this is sooo poorly portrayed in this movie; it's like one of the old TV serials--we go from one scenario to another; in the beginning, we're forced to time-hop back and forth ala Quentin Tarentino, filling in gaps in the audience's understanding of Zamperini's mental and psychological state. It gets tiresome and distracting. There is no drama, nor tension, nor dread in this movie. More than anything, the viewer is never immersed in the character of Louis Zamperini; we do not fear for him, we don't cheer for him, we don't hope for him. There's just not enough ""there"" there... A good horror/mystery/drama always stands on one singular premise: do you, as the viewer, care what happens to the 'victim'?

The movie is so poorly done, my answer was, 'no'; let's get to the next scene, because this one will end up as we expect. SPOILER ALERT:

.
.
.
.
.
Who didn't expect ""the Bird"" (Watanabe) to reappear in Zamperini's POW life? Who cared at all that the rest of his crew (aside from pilot Philips) didn't survive the crash? Who cared that Louis, the ""dago-wop"" surmounted the childhood challenges to become a confident Olympian? And WHY DIDN'T WE?

The actors are not very accomplished; there wasn't much in their performances to relate to; this is probably Angelina Jolie's fault. The project was evidently too much for her. Maybe it's her own acting background; she's a romance and action star; light-weight fluff undeserving of Helen Mirren/Meryl Streep roles. It shows here.

This could have been such a great tome to our vets; instead, it's a dry docu-drama; equal to anything on The History Channel, but not worth viewing except to say ""I've seen it"".",1429833600,10,2039,4.985294117647059

6181226,5,B00HLTDCLM,"This is a good movie. It runs a little slow at times. And, after the movie, I felt a little angry toward the Japanese. One thing that never makes sense in the movie: Why did the main character insist on knowing what happened to the Marines who were on the island? Nothing preceding this would make him ask. But, the Japanese tell him they were beheaded. It only reminds us all of the extreme war atrocities committed by the Japanese against every army they have ever fought. It took me a few days to shake off some of the ""dirty"" that hung around after watching this one.
The other thing I don't comprehend: Why did Angelina Jolie make this movie about a man who found faith? The only reason I can see is that it empowered her to omit the text about how God was with him in his trials. This is especially interesting to me, a former Marine and soldier. In Survival, Escape, and Evasion training, they teach that those who survive as POWs are those with strong faith and/or strong family relationships. The atheists and agnostics and weak-religious types tend to let go.
Some are saying Jolie found God while making the film. I notice nobody is saying she found Jesus. And, it remains to be seen if she will join the ""Universal"" church in Rome, as many other actors and world leaders have in recent years. Or, if this is just a ploy so Christians will not boycott. It remains to be seen. As for me, I sincerely hope she finds Jesus and not religious, white-washed tombs filled with vipers.",1429747200,2,1488,4.454212454212454

6181234,4,B00HLTDCLM,"I OWN the Band of Brothers & The Pacific metal box sets. etc., etc. So you get the picture. If it's about those guys I am likely to check it out. before most any other genre.
Bombers can be beautiful. The movie starts in the sky with a beautiful sun rise as B-24s look like a flock of geese approaching from the distance. Very pretty actually. The movie is not just a war-in-the-mud affair. Moviemaking in general has progressed past that. The first part of the movie is better than the last half (to me), meaning the ""bird"" part. Without being a spoiler, I will say that attention to detail of the in and out of the B-24 is a treat, action sequences good. Same attention to period (era) detail is evident in the heroes' childhood retelling. Good to see ""antique"" cars & kitchens looking rather real .

The bad guy ""Bird"" guard/C.O. almost fails in an O.C.D repeating of bamboo beatings for the same exact offense. ""Bird"" comes across as a failure as a human being though, which is very true.

However I must caveat from here on:  Japan today is NOT that bad old Imperial Nippon.

""Bird"" was a product of old world systems of class/caste/royalty inequalities which were indoctrinated as ""divinely ordained"".  Only the rare person emerges from a corrupt foundation as a good person. In the movie he seems to be in a latent homosexual attraction to ""the hero"". In reality such guards, etc. treated everyone that way. Nazi or Japanese, the ""rulers"" demanded utter subjugation of any lower caste. Look into old Japanese history (or anywhere) and you find that lower classes were expected to keep there eyes lowered around the upper class. The barbaric treatment of prisoners was typical by Axis powers in WWII, but Imperial Japan was infamous for sadism. The Nazis tried to disguise some of theirs as ""medical research"" (spit on the ground here).
The recurring ploy is not insufferable, just noticeable to ""demonize"" him that history has actually proven bad. The ""bird"" and his ilk.
For the heroes part, it is almost refreshing to see the truest point of view towards those who suffer and endure for our freedoms and well being presented by the writers.
As Congressional Medal Of Honor Basilone would have told you, it takes all of them stepping out into the ""danger zones"".
Thank you Veterans for that.",1429747200,2,2299,4.708955223880597

6181469,5,B00HLTDCLM,"THE TRUE story of Louis Zamperini, Olympic athlete and WWII prisoner of war, stays with you long after the end credits. Its a good thing there are bonus features for follow up.

Because we want to learn more about this man. Inside Unbroken, a three part making-of, tell us Zamperinis autobiography, Devil at My Heels, was published in 1956. It was quickly optioned for film to star Tony Curtis, but Curtis took on Spartacus instead; Zamperinis story dropped into backroom purgatory. Just waiting for the right time and the right audience to appreciate and learn from it.

Laura Hillenbrand discovered Zamperini while researching Seabiscuit: An American Legend, the basis of the Oscar-nominated film. She found a story about Zamperini on the flip-side of a newspaper article and it stayed with her. It wasn't long before she was in contact with the man himself, who became a second grandfather to her, she says in one of the bonus features. Zamperinis children and grandson, who appear throughout the extras, say the two spent years back and forth on the phone as Hillenbrand gathered details for her book, Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.

And then producer/director Angelina Jolie got her hands on it. Now we have Zamperinis heroic experience on film.

Like others of its kind  Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence, Rescue Dawn  Unbroken is a story of personal triumph under inhuman suffering. The son of Italian immigrants brought up during the Depression, he was a hell-raiser of a boy. His life changes when his older brother, Pete, takes him under his wing and gets him interested in track, where he excels earning a shot at the Olympics. It was there the Torrance [California] Tornado became The Zamp, but as the film opens, we find him as Lt. Zamperini, a bombardier on a B-24 Liberator in 1943.

Jolie takes us behind operations in a way few WWII films do. The planes were wrecks, repaired again and again until it seemed little more than hope kept them in the air. The opening dogfight is a thriller. So is the next flight  which crashes into the Pacific soon after lift-off, leaving him and two crew members adrift for 47 days. Zamperini and his fellow survivor are picked up by the Japanese and sent to a prisoner of war camp. His Olympic experience nets the attention of the sadistic camp commander played by Takamasa Ishihara, whom the men have nicknamed The Bird. The Japanese attempt to use Zamperini for propaganda, promising food and better living conditions. When The Zamp refuses to cooperate, The Bird turns punishment into a mission.

That Jolie doesn't push us to our level of endurance is a plus. We are able to absorb Zamperinis horrific experience while taking in his boyhood and youth in flashback. Yes, The Zamp was an American kid like many others; he becomes trapped in a horrific experience. We know hell be rescued, but getting there is a hard-won journey. What the end credits and extras tell us is that Zamperini went through even more once he got home. Suffering from PTSD, he self-medicated and became an alcoholic; he nearly killed his wife during a nightmare.

But he turned this misery around. You can see it yourself in the bonus features The Real Louis Zamperini and Louiss Path to Forgiveness, and hear about it from his family and friends. It lays the groundwork for another movie; at the very least, it should drive us to Hillenbrands book.

Ten deleted scenes, a longer look at Prison Camp Theater: Cinderella, and Cast and Crew Concert Featuring Miyavi complete the extras. Miyavi is the rock star alias of Takamasa Ishihara  and we get to hear the goods in the feature introduced by Jolie.

Visuals on Universals Blu-ray presentation are perfect. Even though Unbroken was digitally shot, it still has the look of a classic motion picture. Roger Deakins was Oscar-nominated for his cinematography, and the color is rich yet realistic from the blue of the Pacific to the grime of the labor camp. Black levels in the camp are especially impressive; we lose no detail. Note how water muddies in an end scene as prisoners wade into a river.

Expect a longer download time to cover the Dolby Atmos soundtrack that brings sound to overhead speakers. Its probably not standard home equipment at this point, but the basic Dolby TrueHD 7.1 soundtrack delivers an excellent surround experience with effects, ambient sound and score by Alexandre Desplat blending well with the dialogue. You won't miss a word even in the heart of the action.

Zamperinis story is an inspiration and Jolie has done a fine job bringing it to screen. Id like a follow-up, please. Unbroken is highly recommended.

Unbroken is an incredible story on multiple levels, and while the movie was true to the story, it didn't seem to have the same emotional impact. For example, if Louie had been hit in the face, as hard and as many times as shown in the movie, his face would have swollen black and blue, he might have been permanently blinded and his nose would have been a shattered pulp. Another example is how fit Louie looked when rescued after many weeks at sea in a life raft.

The director should be ashamed.
Reality check tip: did no one involved in this movie consider that it was inaccurate to see the prisoners clean shaven - even after 45 days stuck on a raft the ""star"" looks like he just came from the barber.

You're not told about the struggles he faced after the war, and how it almost destroyed his life. I don't believe that ""unbroken"" is the appropriate title for his life story. Rather, ""Broken, Then Redeemed"" would be more fitting.

That being said, he movie allowed me to more realistically understand what POW's have gone through - not easy to watch. I wouldn't recommend this for young children. Perhaps teens at the youngest.",1429401600,,720,4.806451612903226

The book actually does a better job of captivating your attention and surprisingly does a better job of maintaining suspense. Use the audiobook version. The book is more faithful to the full scope of Zamerini's life. He didn't just endure physical ardors and atrocities and emerge unbroken. He was broken in many ways and the title is misleading. How he let go of his hate, and how he came to return to Japan to forgive his captors is the rest of the story that makes this worth telling.",1429401600,,619,4.535714285714286

In fact, if you HAVEN'T read the book, I recommend you see it, as I believe it will whet your appetite to seek out the superb Laura Hillenbrand book to find out what radio announcer Paul Harvey used to refer to as THE REST OF THE STORY!  It's been mentioned numerous times that Louie Zamperini' s Christian experiences were omitted or glossed over, and that, expectedly, is true. (This was a secular film, folks) Where I think the film really missed the boat was omitting Louie' s Olympic experiences in ""the Heart of Darkness"" - the growing evil Nazi regime in Germany, and also there could've been a lot more about the experiences of what the air crews of the B-24 Liberators had to go through.

The story was nicely transitioned from book to screen and Angela Jolie has done a really superb job in recreating the 1940's period and constructing stunning visual cinematics.  The performances are generally good - although this is really a film where the events and narrative drive the overall impressions.

My only criticism is that Jolie fails to get to the ultimate point of the story and the ultimate meaning of the protagonist's life.  After the war the hero went home and experienced tremendous personal problems, including alcoholism, until he found religious faith and embraced forgiveness as the cure to his emotional pain and suffering. There are brief references to this metamorphosis at the film's conclusion, but removing them from the dramatic telling of the story just flat out misses the point.  It is this ultimate evolution to a loving, forgiving human being that is the foundation for his becoming and remaining Unbroken.

Perhaps it is Hollywood's discomfort with religion that caused Jolie to de-emphasize this element of the tale.  But it is a mistake that make the film a bit depressing.  A few less beatings and a little more redemption would have made this a more uplifting film.",1429142400,3,1302,4.940366972477064

6181749,5,B00HLTDCLM,So if some people want to bash this film saying the book is better... well.. the book is ALWAYS better! I never heard of this guy and I got immersed in the film. A film not for everyone but I recommend it. Plan on reading the book next.,1429142400,,236,3.9375

6181766,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Angelina Jolee did a fine directing job.  Personal viewpoints to your screen, as though you were on the inside. You can relate to the lead actor as though it may have been you.  Acting was so good that you know you are actually thinking the same thing he is in those moments where he is not saying anything and yet is screaming thoughts through his expressions. Great film, not as moving as something Steven Spielberg could do as he did with the little girl in the red dress in the Jewish film about the holocaust, but a close second in so far as the personal experience of this man for whom the film was written about.  It's a good all around film.  Good Job Angelina!",1429056000,,669,4.328

6181925,4,B00HLTDCLM,"I couldn't take my eyes off it.  I hadn't read the book, so I was hanging on every scene.  I like that the movie did not just focus on his imprisonment, because the time in the boat was just as interesting, inspiring, and instructive about his resilience.  I did not like the brief scene when they were found in the boat by the Japanese, because the shadows of the soldiers were made to be too big.  For a shadow to be nearly the size of a person, the person making the shadow needs to be almost right next to a person, but when they showed the soldiers, they were standing much higher up than the two in the boat.  So that part was unrealistic, but the rest of the movie seemed quite real, though as others have said, I would also like to have seen more of his post-war life.  For example, what was it like when he finally connected with the guy he spent all that time in the boat with?  What kind of a father was he?  What work did he do?

My only other question or comment is whether the other guys in the prison camp did nice things for him to try to help him out.  It seems to me that if I had to punch a fellow soldier in the face, and then watch the entire camp do the same, I'd want to sneak him a little extra food, rub his feet, fluff his pillow, something!

Also, why did the people who told the newly arrived prisoners where to go at the camp have an Australian accent?",1428883200,,1381,4.040441176470588

The flashbacks we have all seen before, like Forrest Gump type things. This is a very long movie.  Maybe I need to read the book and reserve judgment until then.  Also, a lot of reality issues...like guys being almost clean shaven while on a raft for well over a month. Jolie did a so-so job as a rookie director I guess. The flick is also very depressing.  WW2 was hell, but we already know it was.  By 2015, do we really need to see such torture?  And to make it one half of the whole film?  I will post my review as just below average for now, but I might also delete my entire review later.  Mixed feelings on this one for sure.

6182186,3,B00HLTDCLM,"I was glad I read the UNBROKEN book. So much more depth; however, I commend the directoral talent of Angelina Jolie. I liked how she used unknown actors, incorporated flashback  technique, as well as portraying the  nexus of Louis  Zamperini's story:  keeping his promise to God.

Too bad AJ left out the climactic  chapter of the book: Zamperini at the
1949 Billy Graham Los Angeles Revival tent meeting. In the biography, Zamperini struggled with alcoholism
when he returned to the US. Billy
Graham's tent meeting sermon on having faith in God, began Zamperini's recollection of the day when he was
gazing at the wondorous sky while
floating in the raft.

Billy Graham's imagery of the sky helped Zamperini from completing his hasty exit during the part of Graham's alter call. (The alter call is where the audience is invited to commit their life to Christ.)

Zamperini accepted the invitation to
accept Christ into his life. Zamperini's leap of faith lead him to accept Jesus  Christ's sacrificial death on the cross.
Christ's act of crazy, selfless love allowed Zamperini's sins to be forgiven and forgotten, as well as all of humanity's sins.

Zamperini's step of faith helped him to
stop his excessive drinking, as well as
having the hellish, torturous, recurring
nightmares of Mutsuhiro Watanabe,
""The Bird's"" memories.

Yes, Zamperini and others survived
WW II. Zamperini was able to move
past the pain and hatred only because God changed his heart at that tent
meeting!

That chapter in the book was an unexpected, powerful left hook which blew my mind. Knowing about that
climatic chapter made the movie a bit
disappointing (but that's Hollywood).

However, I give AJ props for giving God credit in a epilogue statement at the
end of the film.

I recommend the book. It drags in the beginning, so jump to Chapters 37-38 if you want the climatic part I discribed.",1428624000,2,1873,4.923566878980892

A masterful performance by the actor who portrayed the young man who represented his country during the Olympic games and as a p.o.w in a Japanese p.o.w camp. He along with so many other p.o.ws  went through he'll on earth with the stinkin nips. The American spirit was so well shown in this film by Angelina Jolie especially when the p.o.w was holding onto the wide heavy piece of wood and if he dropped it he would be killed but he remembered what his friend or it was his brother said to him ""  If you can take it,you can make it."" And he did, he raised up that piece of  lumber and let out a primal scream right in front of the leader of the p.o.w camp  It was AWESOME! These men who served their country gave up all they had all gave some and some gave all. I myself pay homage to them for what they did and went through and I as a patriotic american say Thank You!

My mothers cousin was a prisoner in Asia being forced to work on the railroad by the Imperial Japanese Army. I recall his stories when we met while I was serving in the Air Force. He became a Minister in a small Texas town after the War and the local Postmaster delivering mail to the local ranches. What I admired the most was he was never bitter about his ordeal. Their best days were when the Air Force bombed targets near their work area. While the guards ran for cover they would steal food to survive knowing they could be shot on site if caught or killed by falling bombs. There was nowhere to escape. Thats pure guts.

6182431,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Biopics touch people in a way few other stories do. In the case of UNBROKEN the film detailing the life of Louis Zamperini, from childhood in Torrance, California where he was a problem child until his brother Peter challenged him in more ways than one  (and who has the most memorable lines in the script) to encourage Louis to run until he not only became part of the school track team but also an Olympic Gold Medalist and ingrained in his the indomitable spirit sense that reigns throughout this story. From the Olympics Louis joins the armed forces during World War II, sustained fighter plane crash only to be afloat at sea with his two companions for 47 challenging days then captured by the Japanese and placed in prisoner of war camps where he endures the cruel harsh punishment POWs traditionally undergo. The story is well known because of the history books and because of Laura Hillenbrand's novel.

The screenplay is pasted together by Joel and Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese and William Nicholson and the film is directed sensitively by Angelina Jolie. Louis is portrayed by Jack O'Connell and his two at-sea mates are played by Domhnall Gleeson and Garret Hedlund. They all give credible performances as do Takamasa Ishihara the head of the prison camps, and Jai Courtney and Finn Wittrock who play major roles while the lads are airbourne.

A point is made during this very long film that Louis tells God and Jesus that if he survives he will devote his life to their service - and then that is dropped somehow. The film does a fine job portraying the horrors of war, of prisoner of war camps, of the act of survival and in doing so it becomes a very moving experience. One wishes an editor would have been more sensitive to the prolonged sequences - at sea, in camps - but the film should have been made and we should never forget stories of truth such as this.

6182532,2,B00HLTDCLM,"I get movies to enjoy.  I watch documentaries, depictions of history, and biographies on the A & E channel, or history channel, or on whatever channel on TV when I stumble across them.  This file is a missed opportunity in my perspective to really put forth a dramatic event that could have been an experience to enjoy more than one time.

The previews mentions the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin.  I figured that the film would have gone all out with images of Hitler, Goring, Goebbels, and Jesse Owens at the Sports Palace in Nuremberg with massive amounts of color with thousands of international attendees present. Well, none of the above mentioned historical figures were present in the film, and the magnificent arena, known for enormous Nazi rallies during this period, was decorated with hundreds of red swastika flags, was not evident at all!  I think that was only one flag shown in the distance, and you had to be looking for that to see it.  The whole scene just flashed by pretty quickly and really was just close-ups of the central character the whole two minutes as he jumped up and down celebrating a victorious foot race that was over very quickly.

This movie is about Louis Zaperinni!  An Italian immigrant family's son who had a hard life of being bullied by his school mates, and went on to become a heroic POW in a Japanese Prison camp.  The whole show seems to have a micro-focus on this one guy, and all his hard times.  No other characters are really developed well, and the historical aspects of the war around him are barely touched on at any point, though there were many, many other events occurring all around him that are mostly, completed ignored throughout the film.

The lifeboat scenes are okay, nothing much different than what Tom Hanks, or Robert Redford went through though.  A Zero attempts to sink them with strafing rounds at one point.  Also, one soldier dies, .....

The villain in the prison camp was a bad, really vicious guy.  He was nasty, but I think the Bataan Death March was much worse.  Actually, the Japanese have been documented in many books, articles, and movies as having been as in belief that any enemy combatant that permitted capture was to be held, and treated with utter contempt.  So I doubt that Mr. Zamperinni suffered much more than thousands of other allied POW's during this period.  He is/was a hero for sure, but not unique enough to be the sole focus of a movie with this much fanfare.

With all the money that was blown on this show, a magnificent WWII movie could have been produced that could have paid allegiance to this hero, and still have enough other plot development that included some other real-life characters, and occurrences to make the film much, much more entertaining, and interesting.  I'm not taking anything away from the great devotion, and commitments expressed by this great man, but as a movie; this thing drags on incessantly.  Why not show a little battlefield action, or a shot of the ""Yamato"" in the distance, the Japanese Emperor making a speech in Tokyo, or anything related rather than always having the camera concentrating on the central actor and his hard life in a cell, or mud pit?",1428278400,,3188,4.697841726618705

This movie is one that should have been told long before. At least the main character whom the movie is about lived to see it being produced.

It will hurt to watch it, the cruelty and conditions these folks endured. But nothing represents the spirit of this country more so than what some were willing to give to defend what we have. No punches were spared in bringing this to you, so be prepared. It is truthful and raw, it will make you cringe. But it truthful and inspiring, a well done film.",1428019200,,638,4.195121951219512

6182816,4,B00HLTDCLM,"If you want to see a movie that relates to an olympic champion turned WW2 hero to a POW/MIA then this is a movie for you, and that why I enjoyed it.  However, I did read the book and was phenomenal.  It is a very fast paced read for those who aren't into reading it will definitely hold your attention.  If you saw the movie first then read the book, you can definitely relate to the chapters since you know what to expect but at a much deeper understanding of  the characters and what they went through.  45 days on a raft can be shown to an extent but what they actually felt and went through, to catching the bird, the shark, and the amount of joy that came when it rained.  There is a lot of tidbits that can be found through the book if you like history and WW2 secrets that may or may not have ever been told.",1428019200,,815,4.031055900621118
6182817,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Very interesting movie with good acting. True story which makes it all the more interesting, set in a time many are not familiar with, partly because  many americans were not yet born.

The raft scene was so boring, it made me want to jump overboard just to be done with it. Perhaps that was the director's intention to give the audience that feeling of hopelessness. Also, I never felt I really got to know the character as there was very little interaction between him and his fellow prisoners. I didn't want to cheer at the end and I felt I should have wanted to.",1428019200,,492,4.301075268817204

I would recommend reading the book to anyone who is interested in really learning how sadistic the Japanese were to POW's. The movie barely touches on it.

The guy just got the crap beat out of him a bunch of times for no real reason.  I would have liked to know what was motivating the Bird to be so cruel, other than ""he didn't get his promotion"".  There is also a dramatic scene with the Bird being outdone by Luis that is painful to watch because it is so clich and contrived.  ""Don't look at me!""  WTF???",1428019200,,520,4.14

The movie fell so short of what it could have been.  It really missed the mark on what a character Louie was and how charmed you were by him in the book.  The movie also assumed you had read the book because a lot of the tension and drama between some key characters was completely lacking, but incredibly built up in the book.

And scene (and picture) of him holding up the railroad tie...no way someone could do that for ten minutes, let alone for an hour or so as shown in movie, especially someone how is on a deprived diet.

The movie tries to touch on 50-60% of the story, yet it adds a thing or two that were not in the book. Why?.
Whatever it touches, it presents it flat and dry... unlike the book, which is so, so, so in-depth.

One thing that the release of the movie did for me was to bring the book to my attention.

6183099,5,B00HLTDCLM,"I don't usually enjoy reading anything about POW atrocities, however, I did read the book by Laura Hillendahl and was mesmerized by it. I am from the generation that grew up right after WWII and so much has been written and filmed about the Nazi Germans and their horrific purge of the Jews, but I somehow had not come upon the stories of the Japanese POW's. The movie was excellent in portraying Frank's  young life and seemingly effortless track victories leading up to his military life. It was refreshing to watch such young and all around good looks of the chosen actors who represented many of the WWII soldiers of war back then. The scenes from the life raft were intensely accurate. I almost didn't watch the POW scenes, because it was so painful to read the actual details, but, curiosity won out and I planted myself in front of the TV determined to see it through. The actor who portrayed ""The Bird"", which I pictured to be huge and ugly, turned out to be a very handsome young actor and so the brutality he inflicted came off somewhat less of a shock to me personally. I was glad to see the patriotic flavor of the era and heroic attitudes through atrocious treatment and living conditions of the POW's. Angelina Joli appears to be a decent director who is able to bring out the full talents of an actor required especially in such a strenuous movie. Bravo to all military personnel who suffer from the horrors of war!",1427932800,3,1430,4.542635658914729

6183104,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Where is the rest of the story????
Don't get me wrong, this is a good movie.  However, so much time was spent showing all the horrible things he went through, I'm guessing there was no time left to film what happened 'after' the war and how trial and tribulation changed his life.  In my opinion, too much time was spent watching all the beatings and torture.  We got the idea.  It was horrible.  But instead of showing two hours of torture and beatings, what about an hour of torture and then an hour for the rest of the story???  Simply tacking on text at the end of the movie, giving a brief synopsis of the rest of his life with no details, is doing things half-way and detracts from the life of a great man.  I did not come away from this movie feeling inspired, but feeling very sad having watched two hours of strife and depression.  I'm very disappointed in this 'partial' movie.",1427846400,22,887,4.365853658536586

It completely ignored the nuances of the prisoners in the camp (the ways in which they tried to sabatage the Japanese soldiers) and basically reduced this person's remarkable life to him being beaten over and over again.

6183132,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Very well done.  Read all reviews first before allowing youngers to see.  Also, there are a ton of interviews and articles about this man's life that are equally as good.  You can also read the difference between the movie and real life.  Hardly any bad language.  No girly drama to ruin things.  The beauty of this man's story is that, upon the moment of making the decision to live his life in obedience to The LORD JESUS, He not only was able to instantly forgive all those who tortured him in the camps, to include his main persecutor, but was delivered from his dependency on Alcohol (which got him through a night full of nightmares)AND he never had another nightmare again!  NOW THAT'S DELIVERED!  PRAISE THE LORD.  This man's faith takes off after the war, after he got married and when his wife almost left him because of the Alcohol.  The thought of losing his beautiful bride was apparently enough to turn him around and remind him of the promise he made to the LORD so long ago when floating upon the raft in the middle of the ocean (depicted in the movie).
His life is an inspirationthe PERFECT ending of a man who will spend the rest of eternity with His Savior.",1427846400,,1176,4.47887323943662

It was good as far as showing the viewer the extent of the human spirit, and how far some people can be pushed without falling.  It also shows the darkest, most inhumane extent of man's existence.  I am glad I watched it but will never watch it again.  It was too difficult to watch, to see the pain this man suffered at the hands of another.  The lesson of forgiveness was also an important moral of the story, and that was soothing to see before the movie ended.

Once the movie got going, I was ""drawn in"" better, but the constant torture made for a grim experience. I would have liked to have seen less about the Japanese prison camps and more about what happened once he was released -- not that his post war experiences were a bed of roses, but they added to the character and richness of his experiences.",1427760000,,597,4.5092592592592595

The best part for me was the actual interview with the actual Z-Man himself, a very alert, smart man for 90 plus years he had accumulated.  One of the men from the Depression era & WW2 that were ""The Greatest Generation""..I think the movie could have been OUTSTANDING if it would have followed him after the war and all the challenges the Z-Man faced and how he met those challenges with grace, love and forgiving nature..even his WW2 Japanese cruel prison guards.  I really wanted Ms. Jolie to create a really special film because I can see she was really very caring about the Z-Man and his OUTSTANDING life (and quiet dignity).",1427760000,8,749,4.567164179104478

Through his faith in Christ he endured his tortures including not being able to coup with life when he returned home. His true commitment to Christ and his ability to forgive was the climax of the book. Why couldn't this be portrayed in the movie? Where was the role that Billy Graham played in helping him to live the last chapter of his life in happiness. It was dismissed as trivial...an afterthought left to lines at the end..too bad.

6183385,5,B00HLTDCLM,Amazing movie about a real WW2 hero. Angelina Jolie did a great job on this movie. I only wish that Louie could have lived long enough to see the complete movie. People have complained about the movie not being about the whole book but then the movie would be over 4 hours long!! I heard that they are coming out with an excerpt to the movies focusing on when he decided to devote his life to god as he had promised when he was on the raft. It will only be available in Christian book stores but I bet Amazon will be able to get it. If you haven't read the book..do so it is amazing. Also visit the Naval Museum in Pensacola Florida where they have the actual raft that Louie and his 2 fellow servicemen were on. Wonderful place to visit to see planes from the first one built up to the present. Best of all it is free and managed by past and present service people.,1427760000,,866,4.1301775147929
6183386,1,B00HLTDCLM,"Compared to the book, this movie missed the mark.  Louis was an amazing athlete, then a brave soldier, then a man of faith and an inspiration to so many.  Seems Jolie felt she needed to foist her world view upon  Zampeirini's life story.  What a shame. That is, Jolie remained true to her narcissistic self. She conveniently excluded  the real reason Louis remained ""Unbroken,"" in life and instead, replaced it with some warn-out mantra that one's strength comes from within and will conquer all.  Read Zamperini's own autobiography or Hildebrand's  ""Unbroken.""  Louis' life changed because he attended a Billy Graham crusade after the war and allowed Jesus Christ to repair the awful wounds of being tortured in a Japanese prison camp.",1427760000,24,736,5.024793388429752

The movie was outstanding and an incredible story line. As a WWII enthusiast, especially true life stories, this movie was an incredibly compelling story of endurance, long suffering and the will to live, no matter the circumstances one faces. The ""Extras"" are a must watch. It includes an untold message of true faith and forgiveness. Forgiveness is so difficult to muster up, especially when it involves such atrocities. With a world filled with so much hatred, animosities and evil, this movie shows that no matter what is done, there is still room for forgiveness.

This movie is about the brutality of evil set in WWII and the triumph of the American Spirit,  good in itself in this main character, who to me was an outstanding American hero.

The main character takes us along his spiritual journey from childhood struggles, to remarkable endeavors during the Olympics during the Nazi Regime. He survived his quest while flying and ask God to protect him and he in turn, promise to return homage to God and promise to have faith, which was tested at the POW camp, time and time again with the brutality of our American soldiers and how they suffered horribly at the cruel hands of the Japanese Regime.

6183460,3,B00HLTDCLM,I read the book before seeing the film. While the film was entertaining to watch it felt rushed. Perhaps because the book offers much more detail and a more in depth look into the life and experiences of Mr. Louis Zamperini. The film is visually stunning but lacks dialog and a great amount of details that were perhaps more critical to the storied life of Mr. Zamperini. I also felt like there should have been more development of Zamperinis companions in the death camps and even before the plane crash that help the story. My girlfriend watched the film with me and had never heard about this harrowing story aside from the snippets I mentioned to her while reading the book. Needless to say she didn't understand much of what was going on because there wasn't a lot of development that you would expect from a war time epic movie. I don't mean in anyway to air away from a great film or from Ms. Jolie's directing capabilities but the film left me with a feeling of wanting more from it.,1427673600,,991,4.480662983425415

Angelina Jolie should have had an OSCAR for it and the leading actor should have had one also.  This young man could ACT...  It is the amazing life story of a man who went through hell and back during WWII only to go on to live to be 97 yrs old.  I had not heard of him, but that did not make his ""story"" any less incredible.  How he lived through what he did, I cannot imagine - along with many others who have lived through similar circumstances.  LOUIS ZAMPARINI - everyone should see his story.

I just do not understand how the Academy Awards people OVERLOOK a movie like this.  This is OSCAR MATERIAL - not Birdman!  My hat is off to Jolie for the amazing directing job she did on this movie.

I think more should have been told about after the war, how the Japanese soldier that gave all the beatings not only refused to meet after the war in Japan, but even said he did not feel that he did anything wrong.

This movie felt more like someone skimming through the pages of a good book. Seriously, a good movie but to do it justice, it would have had to be at least 4 hours long. There are so many things left out. The Japanese were monsters and they did monstrous things to the gi's. They made the Nazis look like pacifists. This film is really sanitized. There was one point in the book where the Japanese made some GI's lick feces off their boots. That's just one of many, many acts of torture in the book. Don't take my word, just read it. Whether you're a liberal or not, you will actually be cheering Hiroshima being destroyed, (Which isn't shown in the film), since it's the only thing that changed the Japanese decision of killing all the GI's if they were to lose the war.",1427587200,,895,4.3017751479289945

With two hours and 17 minutes to work with, you would think that they would have been able to get some of the most important aspects of the story across. Phillips is largely ignored, and Louis is presented in a shallow manner. Had this movie been fiction, I would have said that it was poorly written.

I've spent months criticizing Hollywood thinking that the snub of Jolie and this movie were based on sexism or some kind of dislike of Jolie. Sorry, Hollywood; you were right. This movie was pretty bad.",1427500800,,805,4.709219858156028

Not impressed with Angelina Jolie's directing either.  Good choice of Miyavi but twisted depiction and dark imagery paints an unrealistic picture.  Man flies in plane, plane crashes, survives in life raft, sits in prison, survives prison---wow, big deal not movie material.  Then credits show that such a ""strong"" person became an alcoholic after the war, but I guess was strong enough to overcome that and run in a marathon or something....this movie was just plain stupid.",1427500800,,648,4.908256880733945

There were some vague scenes where it appeared the kid, although a trouble child in his youth, had faith and religion he could turn to  because of his mom's obvious religious leanings, but it kept reaching for that only to fall very short. The combat scenes were excellent, the acting superb, but even a scene where the pilot of a bomber, having survived a harrowing landing after a mission, was on is knees praying and crossing himself, the main character actually just sort of dismissed it. I got more of an impression that he was swayed by his troubled youth and being a tough guy rather than having an relationship with the things that make us strong under horrific torture.

The movie is also a tad long at 2;15. When it was over I just sort of shrugged and it made me wonder what drove him, inspired him to be ""unbroken"". It just wasn't there.",1427500800,,1041,4.616216216216216

What about the suffering of the family.  We must always remember the sacrifice made for freedom and sometimes knowing the true suffering makes an imprint on those of us who sit home enjoying a good life with our children safe and sound because of all veterans around the world.  We might even be more careful when people want to take our freedoms away.  This was a great and good man and there are many more right behind him.,1427500800,,572,4.40952380952381

My dad was legally blind by the time the book was released and my brother had suffered a debilitating stroke 3 years earlier.
The three of us were completely mesmerized and enthralled by Louis Zamperini's story!  What an incredible man!  What a true American hero!
This movie is beyond a disappointment, it is an injustice and a disservice to not only the memory of a great man, but to all service men and women.
Mr. Zamperini deserved the best movie Ms. Jolie could make, not this horrid farce.

The filmmakers never give us a reason to empathize with the characters but see a few snippets from the life of this outstanding man. I saw Seabiscuit, Laura Hillebrand's other book that was adapted for the screen, the same day. What a difference between the two films. Save your money and wait for this to come on free TV or read the book. I read the book straight through on a business trip a couple months ago.

If you've read the book, then you will realize how absolutely superficial the movie is.  If you haven't read the book--buy the book, not the movie.  Jolie does such a disservice to Louie (and the others who suffered as he did).  There is no way to cram the events of this novel into a movie (as is the case with most novels).  In the end, she has to cut out, blend together, gloss over, and reduce to snippets so much of his story, that the impact and the true beauty of the story is lost.  This story isn't about entertainment; it's about appreciating and loving a man who suffered and lost much...but in the end, remained Unbroken; please honor Louie and his sacrifice by READING his story, not  padding Jolies pockets.

It was quite gripping and definitely a must see.  To those Christians that criticized it because Angelina left out his faith.  I can't disagree more.  First of all, you would have to read the book to find out he doesn't become a christian until well after he was back from the war.  This movie only covers his time in the war with some flash backs to describe his upbringing and his Olympic career.  The movie would easily have been 3 hours if Angelina chose to tell his entire story.  She did put in the end that he attributes his ability to forgive those that tortured him and the ability to get past his experience to his faith.  It was mentioned twice in the end.  Again, this is a must-see movie!  People must see and appreciate what those before us sacrificed for this country.  I know Louie Zamperini was by no means the only American to have experienced such horror but thank you for telling your story and representing what the many men and women have given for this country.",1427241600,,1127,4.391304347826087

The ending of the movie did not go into detail of Louie's after the war issues, which gives a good understanding of the issues faced by returning veterans of WW2. The movie misses a portion of the religious issues or agreements with god, Louie made during his time during the war and after war.  The movie has good texture and thrusts the viewer into his story. Overall it is a good movie, too bad closing issues such as his return home were removed from the movie, this would have made it a more pragmatic story of the fact he was only human and experiences affect a persons future.

Beautiful movie, great cinematography, and the cast of unknown actors made WWII feel all too real. My parents were of Italian heritage and my Dad was a WWII veteran who struggled with PTSD for much of my youth. I felt the authenticity of the times and the characters. Often historical movies follow a chronological linear path to create a story arc where perhaps none existed. ""Unbroken"" judiciously moves back and forth in time to focus on events in the early life that shaped the character of the man. This also relieved the tedium of the long lost at sea and prisoner sequences. Angelina Joile will only get better as a director and she is quite good already.",1426636800,,773,4.649635036496351

I know Hollywood does not believe, therefore, they choose to ignore anything, even if it's the truth, if it does not fit their world view.

In the end I felt like yeah he made it through all these trials and then what.  The captions at the end of the movie to show that he went on to follow Christ and find forgiveness, did not do it justice.  This could have easily been and two or three part movie that held people captive.  It was to short to do complete justice to what his whole life represented.

Far from leaving me satisfied, the film version of Unbroken left me empty and hollow, trying desperately to understand the characters and their motivations.

One of the most important aspects of the book was how Louis was so mentally tortured when he got back home (PTSD, etc).  He was miserable until he found God with the help of Billy Graham.  But there must be a strict separation of church and hollywood.  Plus that Jap soldier the Bird was a seriously demented and mentally unstable person.  The movie did not touch on that aspect much.  He was a total wing nut.  Sadistic.  Sexually gratified by torturing American POWs.",1426636800,,530,4.5638297872340425
6183992,3,B00HLTDCLM,"No ""Bridge on the River Kwai"" (also based on actual events) where there is much deeper emotional connection with the characters. Roger Deakins is amazing (as would be expected) and the film is VERY good looking. But also unnecessarily protracted by needlessly long
(and fetish-ized) torture scenes. ""The Railway Man"" shows you can establish an abundance of empathy for the pain without the
extra half hour of sadism, which borders on ""Torture Porn"". What keeps your attention, of course, is the very valid question, ""How could he possibly survive?"" And that's legitimate. I thought the best scenes were when ""Z"" refuses to be a propaganda mouthpiece and live at the Japanese ""Four Seasons"" and opts to return to prison and solidarity with his fellow prisoners, and, of course, the ""Beam scene"" where ""Z"" holds a heavy beam up over his head for over 30 minutes, which finally breaks ""The Bird."" I also find it fascinating that when the war was over and ""Z"" was forgiving his captors, ""The Bird"" refused to meet with him!",1426636800,,1019,4.862068965517241

6184029,3,B00HLTDCLM,"If you are a conservative person, perhaps you should do yourself a favor and simply skip this review as it will upset you.

One big problem I had with this film from the get-go was the unbridled, uncritical air of soldier worship so thick that it seems to suggest that all other hard working people of the world are completely worthless and their work wholly unmeaningful.

This film was touted as a celebration of the unbreakable human spirit, but if you want that, you are instead advised to watch the excellent Netflix show ""The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt"" instead of this film as all this film does is annoy a liberal person like myself to the zenith of frustration; as many of us can see right through Angelina Jolie's hyperauthoritarianist agenda, whether or not (certainly was not), her aim.  Instead it seems only to validate accusations that she is at the most, a covert Nazi worshipper, part of an illuminati with her ties with other international orgs through her goodwill ambassadorship and advocate of eugenics; and at the least, a pernicious authoritarian elitist.

Maybe she was trying to make some statement, but that's what I got from this film.  Italian stereotyping on par with the annoyingly racist beginning of Saturday Night Fever; single-minded aggrandization of the military as unblemishingly blameless; and of course, depicting the Japanese as singularly murderous, torturous scoundrels--which any military most certainly is to captured enemy combatants without exception (ie: abu ghraib)--it's as if we are trying to re-ignite some stuff with the Japanese who actually love the US (well, except for the last decade perhaps).  And of course, we all convenienly forget what happened to the Japanese at the end of WWII don't we?  So they tortured some folks.  I guess we got them back, didn't we?",1426377600,,1818,5.036666666666667

6184031,1,B00HLTDCLM,"I have not read the book as other reviewers here and so my opinion is based on the film alone. I found this film tedious to the point of boredom. I had had high expectations for this film since I was really impressed by Jolie's ""Land of Milk and Honey"", I expected a solid film but this failed miserably. First of all there is hardly any character development of the lead character, no emotional resonance, no depth of character. The supporting characters are just card board screen fillers. I  left the film bored and with no feeling for the hero, there is little imparted on what emotional struggles ensued to help him persevere, no insight into his weaknesss and strengths. The fault is not just with direction but in the script itself which has no meaningful dialogue and simply stitches a series of events together, from what I understand the book gave them a lot to work with so I can only assume their efforts to bring the material to life an unsatisfactory attempt. I may now read the book if only because it's so praised here by the reviewrs of this film, if this film were all I had as introduction to the life of this man he would soon fade from memory. I made the mistake of buying this film, I suggest those who want to see it wait until it's available as a rental. It's as banal as the cliche ""if you can take it you can make it.""

Zamperini was offered freedom in Tokyo and he rejected it and went back to camp. And this is just one incident in which his good character comes through in the movie. Jolie did a very good job in making sure the audience could feel part of the action and understand what the characters were going through. Her work is """"A"""" material. Zamperinis life was so rich that to tell them all in three hours is impossible. Make no mistake, the quality of Jolie's direction is superb. The beginning is very unique. I give Unbroken three and a half stars just for the relatively unbalanced distribution of Zamperini's life in this production. Absolute thumbs up for direction and overall message. If Zamperini is watching from heaven, he is smiling for this work. It reflects his spirit.",1426291200,,913,4.6419753086419755

He worked as a slave laborer on the infamous Bura-Siam Railroad (Death's Railway) which was made famous by the movie The Bridge Over the River Kwai, another misrepresentation of the facts. Unbroken starts out with the comment that it is a true story.  Like MacArthur, the Director gives the Japanese wide latitude and glosses over the the truth. When I bought the movie I told my wife that even Angelina Jolie could not screw up a strong story like Unbroken. Well, I was wrong. I feel this movie is a dishonor to men like my father who suffered truly unimaginable torments.  My father's story is at http://sw-expow.com.",1426204800,4,714,4.741935483870968
6184047,5,B00HLTDCLM,"Positively surprised how good this film is.  This is Angelina's second feature film, after the largely successful in Europe, In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), which I found to be an astonishing debut in film making.  Looks like Mrs. Jolie likes to make movies about wars and how its affects humans.  What's even more to it, she is really good at it.  IMDb rates her debut film at 4.3 stars...which to me is a ridiculously low rating score.  Unbroken (2014) gets the score of 7.1 which is fair.  I also think that Mrs. Jolie and Clint Eastwood have similar taste in film directing.  In the future, I would like to see the two collaborate together on some political/war film.

About Unbroken (2014):  the film is composed of three short films in one.  The first part opens up with the main character Louis Zamperini (real life person on whose life the film is based on).  Louis comes from a family of Italian immigrants.  At the start of the film we are introduced to already grown up Louis.  He is serving in the U.S.A. military forces and flying as a crew-member in one the American bombers.  During a bombardment of some Japanese occupied island, Louis flashes back to the times of his childhood and how his brother saw a talent in him.  Louis as a child was getting in all kinds of trouble at school and at home.  His older brother Peter took him under his wing and helped him become an Olympic speed runner.  Part two of the film, begins with Louis and his fellow air-men flying  a random mission over the Pacific.  Their bomber's engines malfunction and the plane crushes into the ocean. Louis with two others survives the crash.  For about the next 30 minutes the movie turns into something of a ""survival on the ocean"" type of film, think Cast Away (2000) with Tom Hanks.  After being stranded on the ocean and floating on inflatable dinghy for over 40 days, only Louis with the pilot survives.  The two men get separated on their way to the POW camp.  That is when the third part of this film begins.  In the last part of the film, Louis will have to put up a fight not with mother nature, but with human cruelty.  I found, the Japanese actor who played the real life Japanese prison cam commander very ""homosexual"" looking and acting.  I think that the casting people did a horrible job at choosing the actor to play the role of Watanabe.  It was irritating to watch that Japanese actor act and speak.  The guy would fit better in some Asian gay porno with his baby face looks and nicely plucked eyebrows.  Other than that, the film is epic.

6184057,5,B00HLTDCLM,"I must strongly disagree with the vast array of critics who have undervalued this film, but I am not surprised. The robotic critics looking for a film to please THEM conveniently forgot that Angelina Jolie made a film to honor Louis Zamperini and she has done that in spades. Perhaps the critics forgot that this film was produced by the highly competent Coen Brothers or that the Cinematographer was world-renowned Roger Deakins, or that the theme music was developed by world-renowned Alexandre Desplat. And with all that, it never even occurred to the critics that perhaps Jolie did not WANT to talk about Zamperini's born-again evangelism, out of respect to his deceased ardent Roman Catholic family ? Jolie is not stupid, but the critics seem to be. I have rarely seen a film so devoid of artifice, so lacking in pretentiousness, so humane in its brutality that I am quite certain the critics also missed the obvious metaphor between Louis holding the heavy wooden piece above his head and Jesus on the Cross. You have to be a nitwit to have missed that. No, the critics, in their conceit and self-adornment, have forgotten what traditional filmmaking is all about.  In avoiding cliches, avoiding artifice, not seeking absolute perfection, and placing trust in her Producers and Cinematographer, Angelina Jolie has managed to produce a film, few Directors today are capable of making, a film that honors its subject matter with sincerity, rather than a film that attempts to honor its director, with grandiosity. It is this that the critics missed, I did not, and Angelina Jolie has the last word on the life of Louie Zamperini, and not those who neither met him, nor even bothered to read about him. This is a movie for those who honor movies and people and not awards.",1425945600,27,1775,4.858085808580858

As magnificent as it is, the movie is only the beginning of an incredible true story.  Louis'  life was hard, gritty, dirty and sometimes very dark. But it was also defiantly triumphant.  To do justice to such a life one must be brave enough to show what made Louis' life so amazing.  With an abundance of material the only obstacle for a sequel would be showing Louis' conversion to Christianity and how he was able to forgive what most of us would consider unforgivable.  Hollywood is not generally known for it's tolerance of anything ""Christian"", and since Louis's faith in God is the basis of what made his life so amazing I'm skeptical about anyone in Hollywood attempting a sequel. Louis was such a character with that zest for life, and that twinkle in his eye, it would be a real shame to miss the whole point.  See the movie. Read the book.

Major parts of the recovery and his journey are either ignored or falsely represented. Major characters are either left out completely or have less than a minute screen time. The brutality of the original story is brought down to the PG-13 level and makes the original story less powerful and less inspiring to newcomers of the story. There are also things in the film that would not make sense unless you read the book, like the part when Louie has to lift the mounted gun off of him. The way it's portrayed in the film makes it look stupid. He tries but cannot remove it, passes out, wakes up, and instantly removes the gun without any sense of effort. I feel that this movie could have been a little better if it was narrated, especially to describe scenes like this that wouldn't make sense unless you read the book or his quote on the situation. Overall, this story is too long to capture in one movie. It should have been either a multiple parted movie or a short television series. This film just feels that Angelina was just trying to grab an Oscar with a potentially moving story. However, the execution of the story was what hurt the film the most.

Unbroken follows the life of Louis Louie Zamperini, from running at the 1936 Olympic games at Berlin to being interned at a Japanese prison camp during World War 2.

What did I think?

Unbroken opens strong with a thrilling dogfight. The speed of the plane, the sudden sprays of bullets and the massive drop to the ocean below are almost palpable. Its a shame that the rest of the film doesn't follow this lead. Hamstrung by an uninspired script (despite being co-written by the Coen Brothers) director Angelina Jolie focuses on Zamperinis physical torment, namely his being punched in the head many, many times. It makes for a grueling film that fails to reward the viewer. Any attempt at exploring Zamperinis internal life or the moral complexities of war are studiously avoided. The prison warden, for example, is an offensive clich of the inscrutable and effeminate Asian man.  Unbroken may be Jolies love song to Zamperini, who died this year, but in its reluctance to describe the mental and spiritual tolls of war, the films messages about self-belief and forgiveness lack impact.",1422144000,3,1104,4.951351351351351

I agree with Kyle Smith writing in the New York Post that ""on a scene-by-scene basis, the film works perfectly well."" But I also agree with him somewhat that the movie is ""trite"" and ""thin of character."" I have never been a big fan of Angelina Jolie, but I can't help but feel she's endured some significant Jolie-bashing just because she is who she is.

While the ""Unbroken"" scenarists have trouble making Zamperini into something more than a generic hero, the basic facts of what he went through are gripping enough. Particularly in the two early sequences where Zemperini is a bombardier for the US Army Air Force on a B-24 bomber, Jolie shows her mettle in constructing some thrilling action scenes.

The flashbacks to Zamperini's childhood don't work as well as they're fraught with clichs. Joe Walsh in Cine Vue points out that Zamperini's brother ""encourages the young Louis to compete long distance running and provides trite motivational speeches. The emotional drive of these moments is there to kindle a sense of the rise to glory; hard work is demonstrated through a series of running montages that imitate Chariots Of Fire (1981), all of which adds up to be surprisingly dull.""

Jolie's attention to detail in recreating the 1936 Olympics is quite welcome and I found it interesting that Zamperini came in eighth in the 5,000 meter race he competed in but broke the record for the fastest fractions in the final lap (the fact that Zamperini was actually congratulated by Hitler, is left out of the narrative; it might have been interesting if Jolie left that sequence in).

Perhaps the best sequence in the film is Zamperini's 47 day survival at sea. It's not only how he survived (of the two other men he was with, one of them died), but we also get a sense of what some of the other characters he interacted with, were all about.

Zamperini's sojourn as a Japanese prisoner of war pretty much sticks to the facts as detailed in the Hillenbrand biography. I found out that Zamperini was indeed punched by most of his fellow soldiers upon orders of the sadistic Sgt. Watanabe (aka ""The Bird""). Zamperini was also forced by Watanabe to hold a beam up, which he did for an extraordinary 37 minutes (although it seems like hours as Jolie frames it). Shooting the whole sequence as if Zamperini was some Christ-on-the-cross figure, was a bit too much! Including Zamperini's trip to Tokyo where he spoke on the radio and later declined to be part of Japanese propaganda broadcasts, was a fascinating digression in contrast to the scenes in the camp, ably highlighting his heroic demeanor.

Of the critics who weren't thrilled with aspects of ""Unbroken,"" some felt there was wasn't enough character development. Tim Robey writing in ""The Telegraph' bemoaned the exclusive focus on Zamperini: ""But when Louie's self-belief is the only subject on screen, which is gormlessly often, Jolie presses her young lead into a lot of face-pulling, anguished grimaces and screams of violent elation. We are not dragged deeply into either a man's soul or his character."" Joe Walsh said that Jolie, ""focuses too much of what he endured and how he survived such suffering, crafting a lackluster and dull film about an incredibly remarkable man.""

Unlike the classic ""Stalag 17,"" ""Unbroken"" fails to develop any of the characters of Zamperini's fellow prisoners of war. Justin Chang notices this shortcoming, writing in Variety: ""Jolie sensitively conveys the solemn intimacy and tender camaraderie that arise among men at war, but she never captures these soldiers in all their bawdy, rough-and-tumble vigor and rebellious energy; nor does she evoke the fire in Zamperini's belly that made him not just a survivor but a natural-born leader, his instincts and intellect as nimble as his feet.

Rodrigo Perez in ""The Playlist"" suggests that ""Unbroken"" is too long: ""Suffering from pacing and monochromatic tonal issues --various types of drab torture for two hours-- ""Unbroken"" is also overlong and eventually settles into a slog with little narrative drive."" And Roger Moore in ""Movie Nation,"" finds the film derivative: ""But if we've seen the beatings, the maddening stretches of solitary confinement, the war of wills between the stoic serviceman and the sado-homosexual Japanese camp commander in one film, we've seen it in five-pretty much every film from ""The Bridge on the River Kwai"" to ""Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence"" to last year's ""The Railway Man.""

Lawrence Toppman, writing in the ""Charlotte Observer,"" felt there was quite a bit more to Zamperini's story, mainly dealing with his post-war experiences: ""We don't see his alcoholism and post-traumatic stress disorder after coming home, the decay of his marriage, the vengeful hatred that led him to strangle his captors in his nightmares. Nor do we see his conversion to Christianity after a 1949 Billy Graham crusade in Los Angeles, an event he credited with saving his sanity, marriage and perhaps his life. He was able to forgive his tormentors, even going back to Japan to try to do so in person. Perhaps the filmmakers were afraid his devout faith would consign their movie to the low-attendance ghetto where Christian movies often land.""

In the end, ""Unbroken"" held my interest. Jolie has more flair for the visual than the narrative, which, unfortunately, focused a bit too much on Zamperini's ""self-belief,"" and not other aspects of his character. The supporting players also got short shrift in terms of character development. All in all, ""Unbroken"" is worth watching, despite its shortcomings.",1421625600,10,5734,5.037974683544304
6184078,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Great book, ok...movie... alot of the beginning parts were left out of this movie.
Not enough story... to this movie.. they coul have done so much better... Angelina kind of jacked this one up...i could have been great.",1421539200,,219,4.7894736842105265
6184079,5,B00HLTDCLM,"The film is based on the true story of Louis Zamperini, as written by Laura Hillenbrand in her bestselling book, Unbroken: A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.  Louie started out life as a juvenile delinquent during the late twenties.  Thankfully, his older brother, Pete, got him interested in running track at school.  That was where Louie first persevered and showed the townspeople in Torrance, California that he had the capability to break existing records.

""If you can take it, you can make it.""

The kid ran just like a cop was after him.  His talent as a runner eventually earned him a spot at the Berlin Olympics in 1936 and the eye of Adolf Hitler, though the Fuehrer isn't mentioned in the movie; nor is the fact that Louie risked his life to steal the Nazi flag off the Reichstag building and getting shot by the German guards.  Even then he was one tough boy.

When World War II broke out, Louie enlisted in the U.S. Army and became a bombardier.  His aircraft eventually crashed into the ocean while on a mission, and he, along with two men, spent 45 days in a life raft, dealing with hunger, thirst, sharks, enemy planes, and no protection from the sun.

Being rescued by the Japanese, he then spent two years in a prisoner-of-war camp, a large part of it under the command of a Japanese soldier nicknamed ""The Bird"".  In reading the book and then seeing the movie, I feel there was a inner connection between the Bird and Louie.  I think the Bird secretly wanted to be like Louie and admired the man's strength and fortitude.  Because the Bird couldn't be like him, he chose to try and break him and failed as the American soldier stood fast and remained unbroken by the harshest of tortures inflicted upon him.  That's not to say there weren't times when Louie wanted to die and end it all, but something deep inside him kept the young American pushing to survive till the end of the war.

When Louie finally returned home in the book, he nearly destroyed himself and his marriage until he found God and the inner strength to forgive those who had hurt him so badly in the camps.  The film, however, ends with Louie returning home to his beloved family and not what happened afterwards.

There is a written epilogue at the end of the film, explaining what happened to Louie and showing pictures and video of the real man as he ran the Olympics in Tokyo at the age of 80.  He and the Bird never saw each other again after the Japan was defeated in 1945.

The movie is beautifully filmed and acted by Jack O'Connell as Louie.  His early years as a runner in school and in the Olympics were told in flashbacks during the war.  The life raft and prisoner-of-war camp scenes were expertly told and filmed, displaying the brutally of what Louie experienced.  Jack O'Connell does an excellent job of portraying Louie and how he managed to persevere against all odds.

Last, Angelina Jolie as the director did a fine job with the film and daring to bring Louie's story to the big screen.  Plus, it was her clout in Hollywood that got the studios to cough up the money to green light this movie.  Even then, it wasn't easy because she had to convince the studio of her passion for the story and of her ability to turn it into a great film.  She succeeded with high marks that's earning the studio back its money and making it a nice profit.

The real Louie Zamperini died last year.  Before he passed away, Angelina Jolie was able to show him a rough cut of the movie while he was in the hospital.  Louie loved the movie and what Angelina had been able to do with his story of cruelty and forgiveness.

As someone who thoroughly enjoyed the book by Hillenbrand and now loves the film even more, I hope Unbroken will receive its just rewards and inspire people to be more like Louie Zamperini, who was a true hero.",1421452800,156,3848,4.479196556671449

6184081,5,B00HLTDCLM,"TEN STARS**********!! I keep reading people's reviews about this movie and it makes me so angry and people who leave the negative comments are so ignorant! I read this book and saw so many interviews of the making of this movie with Angelina Jolie and Mr. Zamperini himself before he passed...someone said Jolie needed to read the book more and that you couldn't get the feel of the other characters. Someone also said she needed to learn her history more! That's BS because if you watched the interviews you would know Zamperini helped Jolie make this movie! He was very much involved as she was! He helped her make it and she knows his life story inside and out! They actually live right down the road from each other. You can see her house from his. She couldn't put everything in the movie because it was already over 2 hours long. If she put every detail of it in the movie it would've been a 20 hour movie! The movie was about him and what he went through. She couldn't put anymore in it because it's a movie. That's why you couldn't get the feel of the other characters. If she added more parts to it she would've had to take more time to add the rest of what happened! She made the movie the best she could using only a short time. She did an amazing job! Someone said its the basic war movie and it was repetitious. It wasn't like every war movie. Everyone has a story and his was truly amazing! This generation would think something like that because Zamperini was a part of the greatest generation yet. They don't make men like him anymore. He sacrificed his life for his Country with no hesitation! Jolie did an amazing job directing this movie! Zamperini was there for her when she felt like she wasn't good enough to do it, but she did. Also, Hollywood has been trying to make a movie of his life since the 1950's! No one knew how to make it until Jolie came along to do it! Know your facts before you leave a negative comment! Other people were complaining it was too long. Actually, it wasn't long enough...how do you make a 2 hour movie about something amazing like he went through? She couldn't put a lot in there if you read the book you know what I'm saying. It should've been longer, but people are already complaining it was too long! Must see this movie! I can't wait to own it!",1421280000,7,2301,4.3534883720930235
6184082,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Usually I have a lot to say after seeing a movie; whether that be positive or negative. For this movie, I don't have much to say. Rather than go into an in-depth review when there are plenty of better reviews already written for this movie, I'll be brief in my thoughts on this movie.

I found the story to be really touching, but it was obviously hard to watch at times, particularly  knowing these events actually happened.  For Angelina Jolie's first directing gig, I was surprised. I didn't expect much out of her, and while this movie had some areas to be improved upon, overall I thought she did a good job. The movie was a little long and dragged at times, but there was a lot of amazing parts of Louis Zamperini's story to tell, so I can understand how it might be hard to choose what to keep in and what to omit. I thought the acting was powerful, and would highly recommend seeing this movie.",1421107200,6,902,4.357142857142857
6184083,5,B00HLTDCLM,"One of my favorites The best stories are true stories. Lots of people like to focus on Louis's life after the war but the fact is the seeds of his faith that would help him through his life were sown during the war as he was going through his darkest hours, and I thought the movie showed this very clearly. The scene on the raft during the storm in which he promises to devote his life to God if he is saved is really one of the most moving scenes I can think of. The scene of Louie's Mom praying for him also moved me, as well as the scenes of him comforting his dying comrades in arms who gave their life's for this country. It put Louie at the heart level for me. Excellent cinematography by the great Rodger Deakins. Why has that guy not won an Oscar yet? Excellent performance by Jack O'Connell as well. Check him out in 71 in which he plays another brutalized soldier.",1421020800,,875,4.183431952662722
6184084,1,B00HLTDCLM,"Well, I loved the book, but the movie turned me off by its lack of attention to authenticating details which would have given it the believability that it deserved. After weeks on a life raft in the middle of the Pacific Ocean, Louie and the boys looked like they had just been to the barber shop for a haircut and shave. Same with the concentration camp. Think Tom Hanks in Castaway. It is all about the details. Angelina Jolie should go back to acting, which she sometimes gets right.",1420761600,11,486,4.47191011235955
6184085,2,B00HLTDCLM,"How can a movie about someone leave the most important part out. Read the first book, Devil at my Feet and skip the movie. I can not give this film more than two stars unless the rest of the story is told. Forgiveness is what made Louie so special. Forgiveness separates the head choppers in this world from the nice people. This movie is mostly about torture and sadism. This film is about the night before the day, except we never get to the sunrise. Very disappointed.",1420675200,8,471,4.425287356321839
6184086,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Angelina Jolie follows up her directorial debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey, with Unbroken, a film adaptation of Laura Hillenbrand's account of the fascinating life of Louis Zamperini. I read the fantastic book in 2010, and was enamored with the story of the incredible Zamperini and all of his accomplishments. Jolie seemed like an odd choice to direct this serious drama, but I entered the theater prepared for the inspiring story that the book portrayed.

The film opens with Louis(Jack O'Connell) on board an American WWII bomber. Zamperini's charisma is apparent as he jokes with his comrades during the tense mission. Immediately, his will is tested as his plane faces a retaliation attack from the Japanese forces. Louis remains calm as he fights to overcome these insurmountable odds. . . a theme that seems to be at the heart of Jolie's film.

A flashback reveals a young Louis who is bullied by his classmates for being the son of Italian immigrants. Encouraged by his older brother who reminds him that ""a lifetime of glory is worth a moment of pain,"" he uses this trauma to fuel his training as a track runner. Soon, he qualifies for the 1936 Olympics, where he runs a record earning final lap.

As he prepares for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics, WWII breaks out, and Louis's Olympic dreams are put on hold. It is during the years of the war that his will is truly tested. Engine failure leaves Louis stranded in the ocean with two others for over 40 days, only to be rescued by Japanese forces who promptly place them in a POW camp. In the camp, Louis is faced with sadistic physical and psychological torture.

There is no denying the skill and care that this movie has been made with. Both on and off screen talent put in a commendable effort in portraying this fascinating story. Unfortunately, the emotional heft of the book is absent in the film. In the book, Louis faces tremendous obstacles including alcoholism and domestic violence, all stemming from the residual PTSD from his 2 1/2 years in the camp. He doesn't find true redemption until he commits his life to his religion. In the film, all events following the camp are relegated to a brief caption before the credits. This denies the story the emotional turmoil and restitution that makes Zamperini's life so inspiring. Instead, the film makes Louis into a kind of super human who, no mater the obstacle (the torture scenes are quite long and graphic), suffers through and overcomes. In the end, the film ends up being serviceable, but never the inspiring story of redemption that it deserves to be.",1420675200,5,2578,4.760626398210291
6184087,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Louis Zamperini had the kind of extraordinary life Hollywood craves telling. Especially during this time of year his ""triumph of the human spirit"" would surely draw the attention of Academy voters and we've heard the drumbeat for both rising star Jack O'Connell and celebrity director Angelina Jolie long before the film hits theaters. Zamperini's story, one that sees him excel in the sports arena and on the field of battle, has all of the ingredients to be uplift and inspire. But that's all they are; ingredients.  Put together in a handsome, jumbled and overlong package, Unbroken looks great but fails to have the impact Zamperini's feats deserve.

Based on Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling novel, Unbroken is almost too respectful of its subject. He's surely deserving, but by trying to cram in multiple phases of his pre-athletic life to his Olympic triumphs to his combat exploits, and finally to his time as a POW, there's simply too much going on to  hold together. Also consider that the narrative, most recently penned by the Coen Brothers, bounces around chronologically with his athletic prowess as the emotional touchstone. Whatever encouragements and lessons he learned giving him the strength to endure later hardships. ""If you can take it, you can make it.""  Functionally it works; you can't help but admire Zamperini but we aren't given enough to separate his story from numerous other movies about the survivors of POW camps.

The film opens with a blistering mid-air sequence in which Zamperini and his B52 bomber team endure enemy gunfire while on an all-important run. As the bomb doors jam and the crew is torn apart by bullets, we see his split second decision-making, courage, and fearlessness all in one stunning act of bravery. This is a long stretch from the petty criminal he was as a youth before discovering he was just a little bit faster than everyone else. Running helped turn Zamperini's life around, becoming a well-respected man who raced for America in the 1936 Olympics. There would have been more races if it weren't for WWII getting in the way. When their bomber is shot down over the ocean, Zamperini, pilot Russell Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson), and another spend a starving, sunbaked 47 days floating in a dingy. Let's just say it's not as exciting as Life of Pi or as gripping as All is Lost.  You keep hoping for a CGI tiger to pop up and just eat them already.

Their ordeal, and ours, takes a more sadistic turn when the survivors are captured by the Japanese and placed in a prison camp run by a brutal guard nicknamed ""The Bird"" (Japanese pop star Miyavi). He takes a special kind of pleasure in torturing the Olympian, beating him just for looking in his general direction. Then he beats him some more for not looking. The Bird is like the grown-up version of the kid who enjoyed pulling legs off of bugs. The beatings get worse, and Zamperini bravely endures them while fulfilling his patriotic duty. When given the chance to publicly denounce the United States he refuses. He only begins to waver when the punishments start affecting the other men. Even then he remains ""unbroken"", but we've long since endured enough of Zamperini's suffering to throw in the towel ten times over.

Jolie's sophomore effort is a marvel of technical efficiency. Much like her impressive directorial debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey, she shows a sure hand for the broad dramatic sweep of war but struggles with the more intimate moments. Maybe there were too many hands involved on the screenplay but clunky script does her and O'Connell no favors. O'Connell's strangely muted performance doesn't live up to the aggressive promise he showed in Starred Up and '71, and one can't help but think he was miscast in the role. There's something about these specific kinds of movies that just haven't clicked lately. Remember last year's The Railway Man?  The problem lies in idolizing the subject; rounding off any rough edges to present the most heroic, cleanest version possible. Unbroken is still an admirable crowd-pleasing film but Zamperini's story is worthy of so much more than that.",1420675200,8,4124,4.913793103448276
6184088,4,B00HLTDCLM,Maybe people should relate to the movie instead of relating to who the Director was of this film.,1420588800,5,97,4.444444444444445
6184089,3,B00HLTDCLM,"This is based on the true story of Olympic Gold Medalist Louie Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) and his internment in a Japanese POW camp. As a POW war film, it wasn't as good as many of the fictional offerings. The intent of the film was to be inspirational. Louie lived by the motto, ""If I can take it, I can make it,"" not my first choice for a life motto. Apparently it is his spirit that was ""Unbroken"" as they broke his body and damaged his mind. He was held captive by ""The Bird"" (Takamasa Ishihara) a man who talked to Louie like a dysfunctional lover saying, ""Don't look at me."" to the point nausea.

At one point the troops are moved and as a bombardier, Louie had to personally see the damaged his kind caused, but there was no emotional, ""what have we done"" scene. In fact at the end, he credits his faith as carrying him through his internment and surviving enhanced interrogation techniques, yet we see minimal evidence of that while he was imprisoned.

It is a film that fails to convey the message that was in the book, except as a post script. At one point I had a Mel Brooks moment and thought what a great musical this could be using the songs, R-E-S-P-E-C-T, and ""Working in a Coal Mine."" My bad. This was a limited inspirational adaptation.

6184090,4,B00HLTDCLM,"If one word were to describe Unbroken it would be the power of forgiveness.  Based on the life of Olympic track gold medallist winner of 1936 and World War II American prisoner of war veteran Louis Zamperini (Jack O'Connell) and his story retold in Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling novel Unbroken:  A World War II Story of Survival, Resilience, and Redemption.  Director Angelina Jolie and Screenwriters Joel and Ethan Coen have re-produced highlights of Zamperini's experiences that took him just about a life-time to learn from, and that no one can say they understand what he went through during WWII; the haunting aspects of war that left him with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the resistance and final pursuit to forgive his foe POW camp supervisor Japanese Imperial Army Sergeant Mutsuhiro Watanabe ""The Bird"" (Takamasha Ishihara).

Unbroken contains many underlining elements of Zamperini's experiences as far back as to his somewhat misguided childhood as a juvenile delinquent to his moments of triumph as a young track star to a WWII US Army Air Corps B-24 bomber pilot and later POW.  Indeed, he went through a period of hell and back during and after the war.  Hillenbrand's book does an exceptional job of retelling of all of the details, which unfortunately, was missing in the film adaptation.  Jolie covered much ground with over two hours and seventeen minutes, especially in the opening scenes, the clich&eacute; air combat scenes of dog fights and later when the plan goes down in the middle of the Pacific Ocean and Zamperini and fellow comrades Russell Allen ""Phil"" Philips (Domhnall Gleeson) and tail gunner Mac (Finn Wittrock) had to fend for themselves and at times add a little humor and trivia to pass the time despite being surrounded by sharks, Phil recanted when Eddie Rickenbacker's crew went down in the Pacific and survived for over 20 days, which also breathed hope that they too would do the same; there is one jump out of your seat and several makes you want to cringe scenes but overall, the first hour provides a good backdrop and history of Zamperini's life as shown in flashbacks. Each scene takes the viewer up to the point where Zamperini is led to two camps, but what one of the missing links was the aftermath of the war and where the book specifically elaborates to the ongoing nightmare at the camps and Watanabe's relentless provoking with his chants to Zamperini of ""why don't you look me in the eye"" that plagued Zamperini throughout his life as a civilian and where he eventually was guided to dedicate the rest of his life to his faith after experiencing a Billy Graham religious revival.

Nevertheless, the entire film is riveting and emotionally moving.  For viewers that read the book, a kindly reminder, Unbroken has the Hollywood touch and specific details are not present.  However, without being too critical, Jolie shows an inkling of abruptness that may leave viewers that read the book with is that it?  But for those who have not read the book, the film only entices one to do so as well as understand who Louis Zamperini was as well as thousands of World War II POWs or any POW that may not have had their stories retold.",1420243200,2,3195,4.865561694290976

I was annoyed that the film did not show what happened to Zamperini after he returned home after the war. For me, that part of Zamperini's life is really what showed you what he was made of and what was at the core of this man.

6184093,2,B00HLTDCLM,"Angelina Jolie took a magnificent five-star book about the many ways Louis Zamperini was ""unbroken"" by  life...and turned it into a two-star movie mostly about a concentration camp.

Perhaps casting a few Hollywood stars might have helped the narrow story that seemed to revolve around body blows in a concentration camp. I thought it was an odd choice for an uber-superstar director/actress who is married to an uber-superstar/actor: not one single ""known"" actor is in this movie.

But mostly I was left feeling grief that the movie defines the inspirational Louie Zamperini by his years as a POW. . .which he refused to do; he refused to define himself by that, refused to allow that period of his life to drag him down. It is how he met life's challenges before, during and after the war that truly made him heroic and ultimately ""unbroken.""",1419984000,32,844,4.847222222222222
6184094,4,B00HLTDCLM,"There are some feelings that can probably be better conveyed through a motion picture than a book, and this movie does a good job of capturing the fellowship, pride, and sense of urgency of being part of a B-24 crew; the fear and frustration of being stranded on a raft; and the hopelessness of being in Japanese POW camps.  Of course, the movie could not contain all of the anecdotes and details that Laura Hillenbrand's 500-page book contained.  The writers and director had to make choices of what to omit; and, in general they did well, but I am critical of the following omissions:

1. Zamperini was unbroken, but not unscarred.  To me, what really made him unbroken was not just his ability to deal with torture and deprivation during the war, but his ability to overcome the emotional scars after the war.  The movie skips over his emotional scars as though his ability to survive the war is what made him unbroken.

2. The movie had several examples of Zamperini being ""unbroken"" during his time on the raft and in captivity, but probably the definitive act of being unbroken was his holding a large wooden beam over his head in defiance of the Bird.  The act of holding the beam for 37 minutes was impressive; but, for me, the defining wartime ""unbroken"" moment was described on page 210. Zamperini was ordered to run a race against a Japanese runner or else have all of the other captives punished.  Louie did not intend to win the race, but he was motivated by months of humiliation as well as the captives' cheering.  Louie won the race and took the beating that he knew was coming and considered it worth it.  Because the movie showed the ""race"" against the Japanese runner in which Louie was defeated and humiliated, the race that he won should have been included as a more appropriate example of being ""unbroken.""

3. The movie attributed Zamperini's ability to forgive to his commitment to God, but it was more specific than that.  Zamperini's scars led to depression and alcoholism and were ruining his marriage.  He found peace through the Gospel of Jesus Christ (shared with him by Billy Graham) and this is what saved his marriage and enabled him to forgive his tormentors.",1419984000,427,2193,4.6796875
6184095,5,B00HLTDCLM,"I just saw a large part of this movie tonight at the theatre. It is an excellent movie. But I have to write that after watching approximately half of it I had to get up and leave. Because I couldn't watch more of the all too true details of allied serviceman being abused by their Japanese guards anymore.

This movie has some very fine young actors in it who are baby faced and in their early 20's. It reminds me of how when I graduated H.S. here in America before 911 I wanted to join the army reserves partly to help offset the cost of a state college but mostly to full fill the sense of adventure I sought. Luckily my father who was a combat vet pretty much told me 'over my dead body.'

After 911 a wanted badly to join the military but couldn't. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I walked out of this movie as well as the recent Brad Pitt movie 'Fury,' not because I didn't think they weren't good movies but because the older I get and I'm quickly rushing toward forty I realize that I am grateful that I never had my courage tested the way the greatest generation had theirs tested. My fathers generation it's tested in SE Asia or the way my friends were tested in Iraq and Afghanistan.

 And that anyone who hasn't been there themselves but thinks they would have made the grade is really just fooling themselves because no man or women can truly answer for their courage unless they were there.",1419897600,6,1410,4.269662921348314

6184097,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Angelina Jolie's film version of ""Unbroken"", based on the novel by Laura Hillenbrand,  has all the hallmark traits of an old-fashioned classic Hollywood drama. It tells the alternately tragic and uplifting true story of an Olympic runner, Louis Zamperini, who survives 47 days on a raft after crashing in the ocean with two others in his crew to become a prisoner of war in several different Japanese camps during the second World War. The bright and colorful cinematography, sweeping shots of the meticulously designed camps, the score, the manner in which the narrative is told are all very much in the traditional vein of films like Stephen Spielberg's ""Empire of the Sun"" or even John Sturges'""The Great Escape"" from 1963. It's also well-intentioned and obviously focused on telling this gripping tale in as a respectful way as possible (which also reinforces the notion this movie was modeled in such a post-Hollywood fashion).

  The problem is that much of the first 45 minutes of the movie feels too conventional and safe. Jolie's directorial style is too much of an imitation of the type of aforementioned motion picture to the point that there is nothing personal, intimate or distinct about the way the first 1/3 of the cinematic work is structured.  The storytelling, acting, characterizations and dialogue (from a script co-written by Joel and Ethan Coen which has none of their snappy wit but instead make those populating the screen spit out tired lines and sadly the occasionally even more exhausted joke). It works to a degree still but we, as an audience,  feel held back by its familiarity and are not as engaged in the goings on of the chronicle as we should be.

  Once the P.O.W. camp scenes come into play the movie's prior shortcomings are quickly forgotten and dropped as the next two thirds resonate an undeniable power. The writing, the acting and even the cinematography become more gritty and appropriate for the material. This bulk of the film puts us through the emotional ringer and one cannot help but think that Jolie could have had the masterpiece she so desperately seem to want to create with the old fashioned set up in the first act. It's a shame the movie takes so long to find its footing but once it does it's an experience in triumphant and inspirational storytelling coming together with the many artistic touches on screen to create something truly special.

  ""Unbroken"" is a hundred and thirty seven minutes long.  In the last two thirds of its duration we fill every wrenching moment of it. Even at this length the movie seems too brief. In its concluding minutes we are force fed a great deal of the narrative's epilogue-like exposition in a blur of words that would have been far more exhilarating and satisfying if it was played out and expanded as another act of about a half hour or so. Because of this the film suffers and in so doing holds it greatly backwards from what it should be. Thus, making ""Unbroken"" simply a good and not great piece of cinema and an example of the importance of a director finding his or her own voice, uniquely setting up the story and giving the story at hand ample time to be told without rushing through events and details as this work often does.",1419897600,5,3233,4.772401433691757

 Who would have guessed that Angelina Jolie, with only one other directing credit, had the ability to produce this masterpiece?  Most of us never saw In the Land of Blood and Honey, her first outing as a director about the Bosnian War so we might be forgiven if Unbroken took us by surprise.  The story comes from the book of the same name by Laura Hillenbrand but the screenplay we attribute to Joel and Ethan Coen, the famous Coen brothers who are responsible for so many top notch films.  In a story about a brave and plucky victim who must hold on to his life, sanity and dignity throughout horrifying ordeals some directors might veer off into mere sentimentality.  Not so with Jolie at the helm.  She brings us the tale with strength and realism.
 I say ordeals in the interest of precision.  The protagonist, Olympic runner and Army bombardier,  Louis Zamperini suffers two separate and crushing ordeals.  On a rescue mission in the mid part of World War II his bomber crashes at sea.  He and two companions survive the crash only to be adrift in the Pacific ocean for weeks on end.  This horrifying experience nearly kills the three survivors through exposure, thirst and hunger.  Indeed, one of their number does expire.  But Fait has not finished with Zamperini and his pilot.  When the Japanese rescue the half dead survivors, they are beaten and given rancid food to survive on-or not.  Eventually they end up in Japan itself under the thrall of a prison camp boss who would just as soon kill his prisoners as to see them live until the end of the war.  Some of the brutality meted out by the Bird, as the prisoners called him, seem casual, as if he toyed with and brutalized the prisoners out of boredom.  Other examples of brutality seem very carefully measured, a studied attempt to reduce the enemy soldiers to the condition of some kind subhuman wretchedness.  When watching this kind of behavior, historically true in every respect, one finds difficulty in forgiving the enemy.
 A friend of mine exposed me to Hillenbrand's book a couple of years ago, so I had a familiarity with the story.  If anything, Jolie down played the vicious nature of the Japanese as captors.  Americans found fast death by beheading, slow death by deliberate starvation and exposure to harsh conditions and in a particularly vile episode described in the book but omitted from the film, by crude medical experiments.
 Louis Zamperini emerges from the story as a man of unshaken tenacity, a model for us all.
 Two well seasoned if not famous actors play the main two Americans.  Jack O'Connell (half Irish, half English) and Domhnall Gleeson (Irish) play respectively Louis Zamperini and the bomber pilot known as Phil.  Both of them have many credits.  Gleeson had a leading role in the deeply moving  and recent film About Time.  The Bird, the demented prison boss, is played by Japanese composer Takamasa Ishihara.  He has only a single acting credit, a short some ten years ago.  It makes another point for her that Jolie used him to best effect.  We hate him pretty quickly after we meet him.  The best acting brings out emotion in the audience.
 This four saw-blade film has a long run time of two hours and 17 minutes.  It should make lots of money after an opening few days of $50 million.  It carries a PG-13 rating but some of the brutality in the prison camp might disturb people.
 Fun movie bit-Universal Studios has owned the rights to the Louis Zamperini story from 1957.  At one time a movie about Zamperini starring Tony Curtis might have been made but it took the push from the 2010 best selling book by Laura Hillenbrand to propell the project into production.  I am glad they waited until Angelia Jolie could take up the task.",1419811200,4,3750,4.683001531393568

6184100,5,B00HLTDCLM,"I had read the book (Unbroken)as well as the great interview with Angelina Jolene about this incredible World War  11 hero and Olympic star.  I immediately saw the movie and it is a wonderful and inspiring story.  The book went into more details of the problems he had after the war with his personal life; nevertheless, the movie is still one every American should see.  It is sometimes difficult to watch seeing the brutality he experienced in a Japanese prisoner of war camp.  The truly amazing thing is this man's  will to live and survive under the most extreme conditions both at sea and in the prisoner of war camp.

Even though the movie was a little long (2 hours and 17 minutes) I think it moved along at a fast pace and I was never bored.  This is an inspiring story of will and determination to never give up.  This is a story for all Americans to see.  I loved it.

6184101,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Theatrical review.  Directing only her second film, Angelina Jolie takes on the challenge of bringing to the screen the truly amazing story of Louis Zamperini.  Adapted from Laura Hillenbrand's best seller by a quartet of writers that included the Coen Brothers, the film has limited focus which seems to be a disappointment to numerous critics.  But I understand the necessity of trying to corral the many aspects of Zamperini's life.

Jolie's primary narrative deals with his terrible ordeal as a POW of the Japanese during WWII.  He was a bombardier that had successfully completed a series of incursions in the Pacific.  On a routine rescue mission, his plane lost power and crashed into the ocean.  Three survived including Zamperini (British actor Jack O'Connell, ""300: Rise of an Empire""), the plane's pilot, Phillips (Domhnall Gleeson, ""About Time"") and Mac (""American Horror Story's"" Fin Wittrock).  The 6 weeks at sea is fully fleshed out and provide some of the film's best scenes as the survivors stay alive by capturing sea gulls, fish and sharks.

Lou and Phil are eventually captured by the Japanese and sent to a prison camp.  Lou in particular is brutally tortured by the prison's commander, Watanabe (Takamasa Ishihara) who is actually a corporal.  Odd.  The POWs call him ""The Bird"" and he is determined to break Lou, a former Olympic runner.

The film does go back to an earlier time before the war when Lou (C.J. Valleroy), the son of Italian immigrants continually gets in trouble due to petty theft, drinking and smoking.  His heritage also gives him plenty of opportunity to get into fights with classmates who disparage his social status.  Lou's older brother Pete (John D'Leo and Alex Russell) talks him into trying out for the high school cross country team.  Zamperini set various records in high school which led to a place on the Olympic 5000 meter team.  In the finals in Berlin, he finished 8th but had such a furious finishing kick he was summons to meet Hitler in these, the last Games before the war.  Various aspects of this earlier life are nicely interspersed as somewhat of a respite from the brutality ""The Bird"" inflicted upon Lou.

If the film should be criticized I would offer that this brutality went on too long, not only for the soldier(s) but for the audience.  And as if it wasn't enough, the POW camp prisoners are moved in the final act to yet another camp.  One that processes coal.  At 137 minutes it's a little much.  Perhaps the neatest trick is that Jolie pulled this off with a PG-13 rating.  That of course allows the film to be brutal as hell, just don't show any blood.  The film can be difficult to watch at times because of the conditions but has some strong performances, especially by O`Connell that make it worth seeing.

There are many more chapters in Zamperini's life after the war, including his new found devotion to God, many charitable acts including meeting and forgiving his Japanese tormentors.  All but ""The Bird"" who refused to meet with him.",1419724800,11,3019,4.8229571984435795
6184102,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Movie was good...but the book was better.  If you are looking for a more 'complete' story about the life of Louie Zamperini and what influenced him to turn his life around,  read ""Unbroken"" by Laura Hillenbrand.",1419724800,,211,4.833333333333333
6184103,5,B00HLTDCLM,"This was a great epic movie. I haven't seen a movie that was this well done for a long time (excellent acting, directing, musical score, editing, etc). I also enjoyed it more than the book-which I didn't expect to happen. It was a roller coaster of emotions.  One minute you want to cheer and another cry, then cheer again.  Everyone applauded in the theater at the end, which I haven't seen for a long long time.  I highly recommend it, but it is not for kids or the faint at heart. Jolie is a great director-go figure. What can't this woman do? I predict best motion picture and director for the Oscars.",1419638400,6,605,4.383928571428571
6184104,3,B00HLTDCLM,"Angelina Jolie shows herself to be a capable director, and there is nothing lacking in the acting quality.  I believe the movie would have been served well, however, by having an extra half hour letting the audience heal along with the character of Louis.  It is about a remarkable man named Louis Zamperini, an Olympic runner who became a WWII airman, POW, and ultimately Christian ministry leader.  I appreciate the dedication every component of the movie demonstrates, and that Jolie didn't try to totally secularize it/take away the religious elements completely, which would be dishonest to Zamperini's story.  I also appreciate that it didn't pollute every conversation with cussing.  I would have loved to see how he heals and seeks to show Christ's love to those who treated him cruelly.  End titles give important information, but I don't think are a good substitute in this story for dramatizing that important resolution.  I also wanted to understand his transition from youthful rebellion to disciplined runner better, which the movie (probably in a takeoff from Forrest Gump) does just by showing him running while younger and then suddenly running while older.  Dramatizing his life after the war, though, would have been a more important use of the screen time than his transition from rebellion to discipline as a teenager.  Things that I would have loved to see dramatized would be how he changed his priorities after attending a Billy Graham crusade, then him seeking out his former enemies and forgiving them.  If the movie added another 30 minutes after the war and made them really rewarding emotionally, that would have made all the difference to me.

It's got excellent cinematography by Roger Deakins and puts you up close in the bomber, liferaft, and prison camp, but there's limited payoff after enduring all the screaming and beating by the sadistic Japanese prison camp commander--satisfying only if you expect it to be a movie just about survival.  The moviemakers had reasonable rationale of trying to develop a smaller section of his life kind of like the 2012 movie Lincoln developed the 13th amendment political battle--that is, trying not to bite off more than it could chew--but it was more draining than inspiring to me, and maybe that's because such a large percentage of the movie is an endurance test of abuse by the Japanese commander.  That was probably the hardest thing Louis endured.  The analogy of Christ unfairly crucified and Zamperini having to hold up a wooden beam as a means of torture is intentionally situated at the climax.  The climactic moment is his unbreakable resolve to survive that particular abuse, to the shame of the evil Japanese commander.  Resolution in the movie comes soon afterward, when the war ends.  After that, there's only a few title cards before the credits telling about how his life was after the war.

If the movie's main goal was to show the triumph of the human will to survive, they did it well.  But I thought a big part of why Zamperini inspires people is because he emulated Jesus' example of forgiveness.  I read Leonard Maltin's online review of the movie and thought he worded his impressions well, which were also my impressions:  ""But what do we gain from watching this stoic American being tortured and punished?  We admire his resolve and strength of character because that's what is expected of us...but something is missing.  Perhaps it's just too difficult to digest so much privation and abuse.  Or perhaps we are stymied because we don't get to see first-hand how Louis Zamperini rebuilt his life after suffering so greatly.""

I really liked the way the opening exciting bomber sequence and Olympic race were filmed.  (An online movie critic named Rodrigo Perez wrote about it, ""This aerial action sequence is extremely well oriented and a triumph of filmmaking, an impressively deft use of sound, editing and composition."")  In my opinion, while the movie could be better, it certainly is not UNWORTHWHILE or poorly made.  It mainly depends on whether you're expecting a steely role model or a story of a man whose heart softened after the war and astonished his former enemies with Christian love.

The ending is what made all the difference for me in the movie Awakenings starring Robin Williams and Robert De Niro, about an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to treat symptoms akin to Parkinson's. The whimsicalness of that movie's ending, which directly connects to what the Williams character learns from his patient Leonard (played by De Niro), made the movie so much more meaningful, because it emotionally moves the audience past the sense of loss. If Unbroken is going to take on an epic quality, with a hero with a Charlton Heston level of will-power resisting an evil opponent, it needs to see the story through instead of quit after the crisis is over. In order to move me emotionally past the agony of Louis Zamperini's journey, it needed to gradually relax the mood much like Awakenings did.  Showing how Louis Zamperini changed after the war would have effectively completed the emotional journey.",1419638400,9,5109,4.990566037735849
6184105,3,B00HLTDCLM,"A competently made WWII POW film based on a real story that's already been done repeatedly to the point of cliche. Nothing to see new here which is a real shame. No doubt the film is well intended and certainly well acted, but what's the real story here? Yes, Japanese POW camps were certainly extremely brutal, but we've seen that many times in film. like Bridge on the River Kwai and King Rat to name just two from the 60s.

But the hero of this story not only endured it all, but he returned home to endure two more years of PTSD, became religious, returned to Japan to meet his captors to forgive them and then returned to carry the torch in the 1980 Tokyo Olympics. Now, that's quite a story. Unfortunately, everything post VJ Day is relegated to a couple paragraphs of text at the end of the film. what is the point of forcing the audience to share the torture and suffering if not to show how this particular person not only survived but learned to use his experiences to become a better person?

Instead we get lots of film of this person floating in the Pacific after crash landing to no particular purpose and lots of beatings and assorted other violence in the POW camps. It's pretty horrific to watch one blow after another. But surely, the real story is how he was able to somehow overcome this nightmare and forgive his tormentors. That would have been a story of real courage and faith, and truly worth watching and inspirational. and given the number of US troops we currently have going through their own PTSD issues, it could have been very timely.

so, while this film is clearly well-made, it has nothing really new to offer or say, certainly nothing we haven't seen over and over in the past 70 years or so.",1419638400,50,1728,4.462025316455696
6184106,4,B00HLTDCLM,"Though few saw it, particularly during its brief theatrical run, I adore Angelina Jolie's directorial debut, In the Land of Blood and Honey, a poignant and visceral drama set during the Bosnian War.  In my opinion, it is one of the finest and most interesting directorial debuts ever by a film star and, as a subtitled document of sexual violence during genocide, revealed Jolie's courageous and empathetic nature behind the camera.  She has now directed a second film, Unbroken, and once again excels.  It is much larger scope and more polished than In the Land of Blood and Honey, and not as impacting, but it without a doubt further solidifies her superior directorial ability.

Her subject here is Louis ""Louie"" Zamperini, an Italian American of the Greatest Generation with a spectacular life story.  He is played by promising British actor Jack O'Connell in a charismatic and focused performance.  Louie first rose to prominence as an Olympic long-distance runner.  His lightning-fast final lap during the 5000-meter run in Berlin earned him a certain degree of celebrity, as well as a brief personal meeting with an admirer by the name of Adolf Hitler (an encounter not dramatized in this film).  Later, during the Second World War, he served in the United States Army Air Forces and survived over 40 days adrift in the Pacific Ocean with minimal food and water after a plane crash.  ""Rescued"" by a Japanese patrol, this bid for survival gave way to another nightmare:  two years of degradation, servitude, and torture in various prisoner-of-war camps.  (Japanese guitarist and songwriter Miyavi, with his metro-sexual and slightly alien presence, steals scenes as Imperial Japanese Army sergeant Watanabe, or ""the Bird,"" a sadist who engineered many of Louie's abuses and was later cited by General Douglas MacArthur as one of the most egregious at-large war criminals of the Pacific theatre.)

This film exudes earnest fascination with Louie and respect for his wartime resilience.  This is no generic awards-season studio product, but a deeply felt paean to the late athlete and soldier by Jolie.  To be honest, it is a borderline gushing hagiography, indulging in the nearly mythic--dare I say Herculean?--quality of his saga, though Jolie and her head-turning private legion of prestigious writers (Joel Coen, Ethan Coen, Richard LaGravenese, and William Nicholson) include a few evenhanded and bluntly uncomfortable moments so as to not completely canonize their subject.  In one, an ailing bombardier inquires if he will die soon, perhaps tonight.  Louie ponders the question and rather flatly replies, ""Maybe.""  The film holds viewers' hands a tad tightly in its positioning of Louie's torments and trials as a stations-of-the-cross march toward faith and transcendence--there is literal sermonizing early on as a priest expounds on the significance of loving thine enemy--but resistance to the inspiration and uplift proves futile, particularly with so many perfectly executed and truly exciting set pieces, shot by inimitable cinematographer Roger Deakins with an equal eye for verisimilitude and old-fashioned, David Lean-style spectacle.",1419465600,12,3156,5.343434343434343
