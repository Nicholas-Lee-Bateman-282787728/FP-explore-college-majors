Typical Zombie film from The Asylum,Its Great The Asylum are releasing their films on Bluray.
Previously I had to buy from Amazon Germany to get their titles on Bluray.

Good solid story and the Legendary Ving Rhames. Taryn Manning does a nice job too,not to mention she is nice to look at.

4860333,5,B005QUQRBU,"I rarely give 5 stars for anything and anybody that knows me knows that I am a fan of The Asylum movies. Yes, their movies are a hit & miss and/or a love it or leave it sort of thing. Asylum has had many zombie movies over the years however, this 2012 rendition of the zombie apocalypse does have a lot of promise and fortitude along with a compelling storyline to make this movie stand out all on it's own. Although, this was not their landmark hit (that of course went to Sharknado [2013]), like always, in all of the Asylum movies, they were able to show unity and strength amongst characters in a situation that never met each other before but come together to help each other survive such a catastrophe. Yeah, I know that this is a low budget movie that we're talking about but if you look at their movie catalog for 2012, in my opinion, this was one of the stronger movies that stood out that year for Asylum. Anyway, around this time period, their special effects were getting better and that's a big plus too.

4860335,2,B005QUQRBU,"When the dreaded words Syfy original show up on your screen it brings with it more dreaded apprehension than an actual zombie apocalypse.  Credit the film for one thing; it actually managed to perform even below my bottom shelf expectations.  A brief prologue relates how a zombie plague referred to as the VM2 virus wipes out most of the worlds population.  The United States Government decides to utilize satellites to hit the nation with an EMP blast, wiping out all electronics in the hopes of containing the plague.  This immediately sets up the absurd nature of the film.  The last I checked, zombies don't drive cars or use cell phones.  Of course this move means the films survivors have no means to communicate with anyone and have to travel on foot.

The survivors include Henry (Ving Rhames), Mack (Gary Weeks), Ramona (Taryn Manning), Julian (Johnny Pacar), and Cassie (Leslie-Ann Brandt whom you might recognize from Starz Spartacus TV series).  The group is making their way to California in order to reach Catalina Island, a reported safe haven.  The characters might as well be cardboard cutouts for all of the development they get.  The repetitious plot is nothing more than movie, fight zombies, restthen do it six more times.  Director Nick Lyon didn't seem to know whether he wanted fast moving zombies as in the Dawn of the Dead remake or traditional George Romero shambling undeadthus we get an inconsistent mix of zombies that sort of skip along like they all have one bum leg.  Whats more the zombies also behave inconsistently as well.  In one scene, the zombies hide out in a school gymnasium and ambush the groupyet in another they blissfully stroll by as the group hides out in a van.

The makeup is strictly amateur hour and anyone with access to a Halloween store could do just as capable a job.  A lot of the zombies look like they just had some blood splatter on them without any signs of decomposition. But everything gets back to the ridiculous scripting that makes you roll your eyes in exasperation.  Whenever the group enters a new building, they call out, Are there any humans in here?  Whats the point of that?  If someone replies doesnt that mean they're humans since, ya know, ZOMBIES DONT TALK!!!  UgghIf you're interested in subjecting yourself to more torture theres a short making of featurette (4:33) and a gag reel (1:02) but when it comes down to it, this entire film is a gag reel.",1438387200,,2430,4.756563245823389

4860338,4,B005QUQRBU,"I first watched this on the Syfy Channel so I knew exactly what I was getting, a passable zombie flick that follows the usual plot devices.  Three friends leave the relative safety of their remote cabin for supplies in a nearby town.  They are immediately beset by voracious zombies lurking in the area.  As luck would have it, two of them are saved by a roving band of survivors on their way to Catalina.  Soon enough, they are also joined by another small band of survivors.  The bulk of the movie concerns their `adventures' with zombies as they make their way to a supposed survivor camp out west.  Their number increases and decreases when necessary to add an ""ah"" factor when one of their rank and file bites it.  Unfortunately, few of the characters are around long enough to acquire personalities.  Most maintain a `body count' only status throughout.  This aspect didn't bother me as I wasn't expecting anything that would require great thespian talent amongst the mostly unknown actors involved.

I liked this movie because everything in it was predictable (okay, the CGI zombie tigers were another matter altogether).  It's basically just a time waster and when paired with a much better zombie flick would serve as a decent appetizer to get you in the mood for a second or third feature.  It's definitely going in the collection with no allusions that it's anything other than what it is.",1432166400,2,1400,4.7875

4860343,2,B005QUQRBU,"Zombie Apocalypse (2011)

 Ving Rhames is the only famous name associated with this relatively high budget, relatively well done Zombie flick.  The other leading players include the talented and lovely Lesley-Ann Brundt and the less talented, less lovely Taryn Manning.  Brundt does well as a faithful wife who has been thrown by the circumstance of a Zombie holocaust into a chaste but real relationship with Rhames.  Manning plays a peevish, stupid blond who would never have lasted the six months alleged in the film.  Rhames very convincingly is cast as a strong, tough man who leads his group of survivors to safety.
 There are some nice touches in this film that we do not ordinarily enjoy in Zombie flicks.  The survivors must make their way across country to LA where there is supposed to be a haven for survivors, actually on the off shore island of Santa Catalina.  Not exactly an original idea is it?  But all across the country, they follow an unknown band of archers.  When they finally meet, the archers say they knew all about the Rhames led band, but didn't want to join with them.  We didn't think you were up to it says their leader.  The archers are one man and two teen age girls, the husk of a high school archery team from Connecticut.  I thought that to be clever.
 There are a couple of technical flaws that could have been avoided and which would have made this movie a contender for good Zombie flick status.  They filmed two sequences in the same block but in the story line the scenes were supposed to be miles apart.  Ok, a bad error in continuity but not a film killer.  What we do consider to be a film killer is the stupid, absurd, and horribly done CI generated Zombie Tiger at the end of the film.  The CI tiger is awful.  The tiger looks like a childs stuffed animal that has been mistakenly put through the wash and ruined.  Worse, there was no real reason to put the scene in the film.  For some reason the director (Nick Lyon-who also directed Species: The Awakening (2007) threw the tiger in for the finish.  He is a pro and should have known better.  A Zombie horde would have served the same purpose, plot wise, and been better.
 We give only two and a half brains to what could have been a good Zombie flick.  Too bad.",1426204800,,2260,4.477941176470588

a safe haven for humans on Catalina Island.  There are funny moments and more serious parts I the film and I enjoyed it.  LA takes

Kardashians(the worst!).  And how in the world can you tell a Zombie from an average LA aborigine?  I don't know, I live in NY.

ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE

If you have read enough of my reviews then you know that I am a fan of a company called The Asylum. They make really bad B movies, mostly rip offs, but they do every once in a while make a good little flick. In fact they have made one or two films I consider classics, yes you read that right and I said it. Well my friends is not one of those movies, it is one of the average Asylum films. It is a zombie film so it has that going for it but that may be what brings it up to average status.

It is 2012 [I assume from the title] and a group of survivors are making their way to a rumored refuge. They run across another group and join up hoping that they will all make it there. But on the way they will run into all kinds of problems, mostly of the zombie variety. They are making their way to a place called Catalina and they have to catch the ride there.

You know while writing this it is hitting me that I actually liked this more than I thought I would. This SyFy Channel flick is better than most people are giving it credit for, for a SyFy/Asylum flick it really isn't bad. Written by Brooks Peck and Craig Engler and directed by Nick Lyon [Species 4] this movie takes advantage of the action style of zombie flick. If it had to play to its strengths which it does, that would be the way to go. From the beginning we get a lot of zombie killing action. This helps cover up the weak points of the budget and such, so well done Asylum.

I wouldn't say this is a great zombie movie but it is a good Asylum one which is saying something. I did like Ving Rhames here since he adds to anything he is in and for the most part everyone was ok here. I have always liked these types of flicks in which a group of people have to make some kind of journey and people get picked off as they make their way to the destination. Add in a very good making of behind the scenes feature and this is pretty good overall. Your average flick but a good Asylum one.",1358812800,,1975,4.00507614213198

4860378,2,B005QUQRBU,"Zombie Apocalypse(released Oct/11) gives us yet another *gulp* taste of what the world end times/zombie ridden landscape,will look like after it all. Wow,I'm shaking my head right now because I haven't been through a watching experience like this in a LONG time. It's like getting a strong whiff of smelling salts under the old proboscis. Hooo-weee! As you know,there has been as much of an ""outbreak"" of zombie related movies in the past ten years from Hollywood as there have been imaginary plagues that these movies purport to show. Could just one more,be that bad a thing?
This time 'round we have what is called a VM2 virus...whatever happened to the VM1? Geesh,just asking. Anyhoos,it has wiped out a good portion of the Earth's pop(that's ""population"" for you non Tweeters)...doesn't it always? Ving Rhames leads a rag tag group of survivors from the eastern end of the U.S.to L.A.There they all hope to catch a boat over to Catalina Island and safety. Everything that you see in between is the usual hit/kill a zombie,run from a zombie and once in a while get bit by a zombie. In between all the ""excitement"",the players all have a resty-poo here and there.
That is the ""plot"",as much as it is;we definitely have a less is more thing going on here. Ving is no stranger to Zombies,oh no. He was last in Dawn of the Dead in /04 and acquitted himself pretty well in the zombie killing department there. So he knows what he's doing by now. Here,he is more of the menacing hulk type of guy,kinda shy and quiet,bad butt and ready to kill a Z at any moment. The rest of the cast,filled with lesser known actors,also acquit themselves pretty well.""So what is so wrong with the film,Bob?...cut to the chase!"",you may ask. Here are some observations from the couch:
Well,you know that little thing about a lack of plot I mentioned earlier? Ok,then. On top of this we have a myriad of faux pauxs and second rate special effects. The cheapness of the make up on the extras really shows,specially in close shots,which they tried to keep to a minimum,but didn't always manage to do successfully. When they didn't you could easily see either partial face masks or full face masks on many of them or just how lacking the overall make up was.
Near the beginning someone has a shotgun firing about 5 or 6 shots in a row,which is amazing considering you should only be able to get a couple off of that type.
More often than not their weapon thrusts were more than a little fake. One of the leading characters liked to pack a sword,and when she had her victim on the ground all she had to do was touch the body,then a further thrust sound was heard,but not seen.
Many times,also,the stars would be swinging at their foes,but very few,sad to say,ever really connected. I KNOW they NEVER connect in a movie,but these were a bit too far away from the extra,and the camera could pick it up quite well,thank you.
One scene has Ving and his sword packing gal pal crossing an L.A. bridge. A close up sees Ving carrying his now trademark hammer on his left shoulder. The next shot shows them walking away and Ving is carrying the hammer down by his right side.
And miracle of miracle happens at the end. The group are attacked by Zombie tigers at the pier waiting for the boat to Catalina. I LOVE tigers,why did they have to pick Tigers? Grrrr. One they dispatch quickly,while the other nails Ving before it meets its' maker(that's someone in the CGI department,btw).Up to now,any victims(zombie bitten)have turned quickly while they were alive. Ving?....naw. He asks them not to let him turn and he quietly dies. I guess the biggest name has to have a proper death scene sans Zombie turning,right?Ah,the perks of being the big fish in the little pond.
It all boils down to this,guys. We have here a film with very cheap production values and budget. Now sometimes in the past this has worked to a films advantage. In those the campiness is evident and there are usually moments of humour,either purposely or not. But this film is played so seriously(I don't recall a single second of humour ANYWHERE),that there is little room to maneuver. This movie might,I say might,fool/scare some of the younger crowd,but that is it.
Technically speaking the film is in a w/s a/r of,I would guess,1:78:1,as it doesn't say on the box. It is generally clear and crisp but there are some grainy scenes,especially when the lighting darkens. Probably the film itself. There is a featurette of the making of it and a gag reel. Both are way too short. But hey,we are on a budget here,right?
In conclusion,after viewing this zombie/apocalyptic stinker,one wishes the film itself had been consumed in all the destruction. 1 1/2 - 2 stars. I feel generous today.",1345852800,,4721,4.682310469314079
4860379,4,B005QUQRBU,"2012: Zombie Apocalypse begins in June 2011 when the VM2 virus infects a French woman. Within the next 28 days(?), 84% of the European population is infected. The virus becomes a global pandemic as it eventually reaches Japan and all the way to the United States. Six months later, the zombie plague has wiped out ninety percent of the US population. A small group of survivors fight their way across the United States to a rumored refuge on the island of Catalina.

If that sounds like your typical zombie movie plot, it is. Course, this low-budget zombie flick was better than what I expected it to be..considering it's a Sy-Fy movie. What's surprising is it stars Ving Rhames. This is, what?, his fourth zombie movie to date? That's what made this one better than I expected, to be honest. The other actors put in decent performances, though. I loved the action. The special effects and FX Makeup were pretty decent as well. The only thing I disliked was the bizarre ending to the movie.

Taken for what it is, 2012: Zombie Apocalypse is an above-average typical zombie movie that fans(like me) of the genre will gobble up. It's not that bad but not one that fans of the genre will likely remember in years to come. Probably in five or ten years, this movie will be part of a collection of older zombie movies. Sad but true. Rhames has made better zombie movies.  I did like it, though, and thought it was okay for a good zombie fix.

Which leads us to-Taryn Manning. She has to be the WORST actress in the history of zombie films. She can't act her way out of a paperbag. Her character, Romona was also the most useless character I have ever seen in a movie. She gives ""too stupid to live"" a whole new meaning. Her friend is being murdered, what does she do? RUN AWAY and yell at everyone else because they didn't save him! The special effects are sub-par, but I kind of expected that. There were a few major errors that would have been cheap and made things look more realistic, but they producers were obviously too lazy to figure out. For instance Henry kills a zombie with a chainsaw, then right after he stands there holding the chainsaw and you can clearly see THERE IS NO CHAIN on it! How hard would have been to use a fake prop chain or put a chain on after the ""kill"". The film moves along fine until the end and SPOILER alert: there are not one but TWO freaky, fake as f@!& looking zombie tigers at the dock.

Fail. No more Asylum products for this finicky film fan.",1341273600,,316,4.660714285714286
4860383,3,B005QUQRBU,"This film, as many have pointed out, is low budget. So don't go into this movie expecting amazing effects, great writing, award-winning acting, and (as others have pointed out) much sense/logic. Just look at it as something along the lines of Sharktopus (if you haven't seen that movie I reccomend it, its about a shark crossed with an octopus terrorizing a beach town, its fun/cheese to the max!). Unfortunately ZA: 2012 is NOT as good as Sharktopus.

I personally don't understand why a good zombie film is so difficult to make. The plot of this film is simple; Zombie apocalypse(oh noez)! Get from point A to point B (we have a plan!), fight hordes of zombies(pow! pow! bang! bang!, lose some friends to the undead(RIP ;_;), and reach the destination(yay!). Unfortunately, they cant even do this simple (and potentially enjoyable) plot.

The action I thought was pretty good considering the budget. Thats about the only positive thing Ill say about this film. I do admit they tried to be original with zombie animals and I respect it, but it was few and far between so it didn't really enhance the film for me. The major downfall comes to these 2 things though; characters and the pace. The characters were boring, I didn't really have a ""favorite character"", I dislike when that happens in a film. But That can be overlooked  because at least they get eaten right? Well maybe if you can stay awake. Yes people the pace of this film is about as fast as a snail moving through drying gorilla glue...while being salted. The movie will have a short action sequence (which were quite enjoyable for the most part) and then go on for about 15-25mins of NOTHING. I kid you not it all nothing. Just irrelevant fluff. So I give this film 3-stars for being among the better 'bad' zombie films out there, it has zombies, it has blood, it has action, its just not consistent and gets boring.

In conclusion: if you're looking for good modern zombie flicks don't start here. Try Zombie Diaries 1+2 (both EXCELLENT films), Dead Snow, the Dawn of the Dead remake (more of a spin off than a remake though). But if you need a new zombie movie and saw all the others I mentioned rent this one. Its at pretty much any place you can rent films.",1340236800,,2227,4.602015113350126

The plot is simple, months after a plague kills most of the American population, three friends are walking to the big city. They are attacked by zombies, resulting in one of them being killed, but the other two are rescued by a group of survivors, including Ving Rhames carrying a sledgehammer and a chick chopping the zombies' heads off with a sword. Their goal is to try to get through the city to the docks, as they heard there is a refuge on the island of Catalina.

The acting in it is not bad, and the action scenes are great. For a low-budget movie I was impressed with the zombies' make-up, but I think they ran out of money when it came to the lame CGI tiger at the end.

Here's one you missed, the scene where Ving and the other hot chick with the 50 caliber automatic in a shopping cart mow down a bunch of zombies in the alley and you can see the ammo fly out of the gun as she's firing but the ammo belt fed into the gun remains perfectly still..this is terrible and lazy and you can tell that the makers of this film did not try to hard.

4860388,3,B005QUQRBU,"Zombie movies follow a basic formula because they are metaphoric of life. A group of people with brains seek out a safe utopian world free from the unthinking zombies who blindly follow the crowd trying to kill the idealists. There are 2 types of zombies. There are the foot dragging raised from the dead zombies and the faster moving viral zombies. In this regard, the film has met the basic requirements for a decent zombie film.

A group of survivors are headed toward the island of Catalina. Some die along the way. Some are added along the way as in any good zombie film. Why they choose to venture on foot rather than drive a heavily shielded vehicle, I don't know. The special effects were inexpensive CG critters, fires, and blood squirts. In these types of films it is the characters and dialouge that make the production stand out from other low budget movies. In that regard, this one failed to stand out. Ving Rhames needed a personality. Lesley-Ann Brandt had dead deliveries and wore jeans that never got dirty. Like John Wayne movies, multiple zombies die when one bullet is fired. The other film that goes by this name is far worse.

4860400,4,B005QUQRBU,"Surprisingly decent flick from a production company infamously, and humorously, known for producing el cheapo crap. The Asylum has done a bang-up job of filling in where the old Cannon Group left off, and I love it.

Film fans need these kinds of companies to properly address the much maligned B-Movies market. One of my film mentors was huge fan of movie schlock and I learned a great deal about movie productions and moviemaking from understanding the need to fill the space left behind by blockbusters and so-called important films. There's a reason why we celebrate Roger Corman. Without the B-Movies, we wouldn't have premiere directors like Jonathan Demme or Ron Howard today. You have to learn the skills somewhere beyond the classroom, and production companies like The Asylum are the field OJT, where you learn to handle the real-world ropes.

Rented as a filler while I awaited the mid-season return of 'The Walking Dead', I have to say that I enjoyed the film.

The story is pretty much standard boilerplate now, so creatively there wasn't much to engage. The screenplay was decent, sometimes dragging toward pedestrian, but not so much as to be distracting. The plotholes were mostly forgivable.

In the film we follow a group of uninfected survivors crossing the country on foot, making their way toward a reported safe zone off the California coast. Does it exist? And if it does - who makes it? Again, pretty much a straight up rip from a multitude of previous similar films. But done decently enough.

It was really nice seeing Eddie 'Crabman' Steeples again. Wondered what had happened after 'Earl' was over. Great to see him still sporting that awesome fro'. One of the few performers that makes that work.

Of all the Asylum productions, and I've seen quite a few, I have to say this was the best. But that's the equivalent of noting one particular moron being better than the others - top moron isn't exactly a blue-ribbon quality event.

My only complaint is that I'm no fan of Taryn Manning. There's something about her that grates; her contorted face, the raspy vocal pitch, her overacting - all suck. And not in a good way. Weak witticisms aside, she really is an actress of low quality in my opinion. How she continually gets work has been an interesting puzzle; my guesses trend toward the lower anatomical regions, but a certain mean-spiritedness plays a part in that.

Still, that minor burr aside, this flick makes for a very decent distraction.",1326585600,,2475,4.848341232227488
4860401,4,B005QUQRBU,"So the last good zombie apocalypse movie that I saw was Zombie Land and I was very excited when I saw this in the Red Box.  I mean seriously, just the title shows how awesome it's gonna be!

***SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS***

So the movie mainly follows a few main characters as they try to get toward a safe haven called ""Catalena"" or something, it's on an island and it's supposedly free of zombies.  They run across some other survivors whose names don't really stand out in my mind as I sit here and write this.  But the main one I cared about was Ving Rhames!  This guy is such an awesome guy that he doesn't need a gun, he just bashes zombies in the head with a sledge hammer!

They move toward the safe haven and they come across zombies that have been shot in the head with arrows and they wonder if these are other survivors just ahead of them.  Later they meet up with these archers and they team up together to travel to safety.

I loved this movie!  I only have two complaints about this movie.

First of all, Ving Rhames and one of the women survivors come across a .50 cal machine gun and the woman says, ""I wanna take it with us.""  Why?  Do you have any idea how heavy that thing is?  Not to mention how noisy it is?  When you shoot that thing off, all the zombies within 10 city blocks are going to hear it and descend upon you like a pack of ravenous dogs!  Plus how are you going to transport it?  Oh I see, you're just going to put it in a shopping cart and wheel it around.  Then when she fires the weapon while it's still in the cart, the cart itself doesn't move.  COME ON!!!  Gimme a freaking break!  Do you have any idea how much recoil there is on a .50 cal machine gun?  Why do you think they are always bolted to the roofs of vehicles and held down with sand bags in front of fox holes?  If she had fired that gun in that cart the kick-back would knock her over and the fact that the thing it was sitting on had WHEELS, wouldn't be too smart either.  You can use your head and figure out what would happen if anyone in the real world tried to do that.  Not to mention when she was shooting the machine gun, the ammo belt that was going into the gun, WASN'T FRIGGIN' MOVING!!!  Ugh!!!

My other complaint is the climax of the movie.  The survivors are ambushed at the docks where they are supposed to meet up with a boat that would take them to safety and what are they ambushed by?  Take a guess, seriously, think about if you were in a zombie apocalypse.  What would you expect to be ambushed by?  Zombies?  Other humans looking to rob you?  Maybe even a lich controlling the zombies?  No, of course not!  That would make too much sense, instead let's have them be ambushed by zombie tigers.  Seriously, ZOMBIE TIGERS are the final bad guy these survivors have to face off against.  That was just... oh my god, my head hurt from how stupid that was.

***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***  ***END SPOILERS***

So even with those two things that I didn't like, this was still a pretty good movie and I do recommend it for anyone who loves zombies.

4860402,2,B005QUQRBU,"I began feeling very nervous when I put the dvd in and the first preview that played was for a movie called Two-headed Shark. I became almost panicky when the words ""SyFy presents"" appeared in the opening sequence. Thankfully, the movie wasn't completely unwatchable, though you will find yourself groaning and saying, ""Come on!"" in annoyance at the screen far too often. There are some good actors in the movie. I got the film based entirely off of Mr Rhames appearance in it. Also, the actress named Lesley-Ann Brandt is one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen, as well as a good actress (or as good as can be expected in this type of film). Taryn Manning was terrible and about half way through the film, it was almost as if the director forgot she was even in it. The guy that played ""Crabman"" in ""My Name is Earl"" (cant remember his name) is in it as well, but don't expect much from him. The zombies are laughable at best. Poor latex masks are seen far too often. This was obviously a film where open casting in whatever town they filmed in advertised, "" Come be in a movie! You can be a zombie!"" and all the local Fangoria readers showed up. Thats fine, except the director spends too much camera time on these people, so the poor acting and bad makeup become disturbingly evident. As for the story, the main thing that irked me was that these people are supposed to be hard-@ss survivors of a zombie apocalypse, yet time after time they show the worst decision making skills I have ever seen. Repeated numerous times in the film- the characters walk in to a seemingly empty location. One of the characters yells at the top of his lungs, ""Any living people here!"", which is followed by a bunch of zombies showing up, the characters fighting them with a combination of hand weapons and fire arms. Bullets seem to grow on trees based on how they are wasted. In one scene, a group of zombies are fighting the characters and Ving Rhames wastes about 4 bullets shooting a zombie in the chest before one in the head. Not because he needed too, but because he was being tough or something. Another character shoots a zombie 3 times in the head (again, not because he had to-just because he could)?! At one point, there is a scene wherein some characters are describing the value of using bows and arrows against the zombies. He announces to the group to make sure they reclaim the arrows whenever possible because they don't have that many. The VERY NEXT scene, they shoot 3 zombies in an alley (with no other zombies around). All the characters step over the bodies and leave the arrows behind. I know this may sound like nit picking, but as another reviewer here wrote, the attention to detail was horrendous. Oh, and the one unintentionally laugh out loud moment in the movie- at one point, a bunch of zombies show up and one of the characters screams ""AMBUSH!"". What?!? They zombies , in between wandering around aimlessly are plotting to ambush people? Silly. Almost forgot-SyFy doesnt let you down.

4860404,3,B005QUQRBU,"2012 Zombie Apocalypse Blu-ray Review

Distributor: The Asylum Home Entertainment (US)

After the success of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead and Lucio Fulcis Zombie in the 1970's the movie industry of the time decided zombie films were the next big thing and released countless movie imitations all of varying quality. Well, it seems as though history has repeated itself, after Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake proved that zombies could still be cool we were once again inundated by numerous zombie chillers again of varying quality. The latest one being the made for TV effort 2012 Zombie Apocalypse.

There really isn't a great deal to say about this one as its a familiar story and something we have all seen before with a group of survivors trying to cross a zombie waste land to find passage to a safe haven. That being said, the acting is reasonable throughout and for once the characters don't seem to deliberately place themselves in mortal danger whenever they have the opportunity. The only real gripe to be found here is some pretty shocking CGI effects which really stand out from the picture (probably even more so on Blu-ray) The story however moves along at a steady pace and is ultimately entertaining enough for what it is, just don't expect anything different.

Released region free on Blu-ray by Asylum Home Entertainment, you have to bear in mind that this was originally a made for TV movie when critiquing the quality of print. Presented in a 1080p 1.85:1 transfer surprisingly the level of detail on display is actually quite good, colours are more than adequate and black levels hold a moderate amount of depth. With no real visible print damage on display the transfer is actually a lot better than it might have been especially considering the low budget roots of the film.

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 and again does a reasonable job providing clear dialogue and a certain amount of bass to the proceedings. Admittedly this is never going to be a reference quality disc and your rear surround speakers will be left feeling a little redundant by the end of the movie however overall there are no real complaints regarding the audio track. Also included is a 2.0 stereo track however the 5.1 option seems the better of the two.

Extra features are represented by a making of featurette and gag reel footage. The featurette consists mainly of  cast/crew interview footage and some behind the scenes takes involving zombie make up effects and is certainly worth having if however a little short, running at just under 5 minutes.
There is also a handful of trailers for about 8 other movies in an attempt to persuade you into further purchases.

All things considered, this is certainly far from the best zombie movie ever made however it is also nowhere near the worst either. At a relatively cheap import price it is certainly worth an afternoon's viewing although the story has since been done so much better in The Walking Dead television series and it is extremely difficult not to draw direct comparisons throughout the film. This one does however have one last (love it or hate it) surprise in store for the viewer with the final minutes of the film being nothing short of unique which is ultimately quite a task for this type of movie these days. Without spoiling the moment, lets just say the characters have more than just the regular zombies to worry about this time around.

ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE ..Do not just go Willy-Nilly against the Zombie Throng !!!

Starring: Ving Rhames & Taryn Manning.

This film really works fast to a goal of impending death and destruction for humans.

Yes,Other films have traveled this territory,But not with the tenseness and white knuckling suspense.

There is a band of humans who use all kind of weaponry to wipe out the zombies who have no plans to stop chewing on everything.

So, Noticed that SYFY Channel is listed as co-producers,Explains how VING RHAMES stayed for the whole shoot and not just for close-ups and Peaced-Out and let doubles and long shots do the work ( You listening STEVEN SEAGAL).

Taryn Manning ( from Hawaii-Five-O and Sons Of Anarchy) kind of plays the JUDITH DEA part from NOTLD,"" You Know What  Mean "" ?

4860407,1,B005QUQRBU,"<strong>Zombie Apocalypse</strong> (Nick Lyon, 2011)

I somehow got roped into watching another movie made by The Asylum, one of the worst studios on the planet. But my pain is nothing compared to that of Ving Rhames (<em>Pulp Fiction</em>) and Taryn Manning (<em>White Oleander</em>), both of whom were somehow convinced by casting director Gerald Webb, an Asylum regular, to star in this mess. Did they really need the money that badly?

There is a thin plot (a bunch of survivors of the title malady have to fight their way to a human refuge that may or may not exist off the cost of California), but it's not worth going into any detail over. Nor is anything else about the movie, its fake CGI, its overacting, its godawful cinematography, its beyond-belief fight scenes.

4860408,3,B005QUQRBU,"I will start off saying I held no high bar for this, I knew immediately that this was at the most, a B material movie. With that being said, I was pleased overall. It makes for a decent zombie flick, the story is average. The survivors try to get from point A to point B, that's it. Along the way is where we see some disappointment in the horrible use of CGI and some slight bad acting. Ving Rhames did offer some relief throughout, but my biggest issue was the zombies themselves. The zombies here vary between walkers and runners. Their makeup was sub-par and seemingly rushed, definitely not the work of Savini or Nicotero. However, the most annoying part of these zombies is turning out to be a norm in some of the recent undead movies, the noises they make are similar to sound samples taken from the old ""DOOM"" video games. These are not zombie sounds, no actual moaning, just the crazed demonic screams that should not be coming from someone who is dead.

Overall, true zombie fans will get some amusement out of this, but do not buy it, this is a rental only.",1325030400,,1068,4.4213197969543145

The cart doesn't move at all and the chain ammo is ejecting from one side expended but the belt on the other side never moves at all. Attention to detail makes or breaks a movie and there are numerous other failures in this movie with the CGI, particularly when flames are displayed.

My other big pet peeve had to do with the zombies. The makeup was pretty bad in numerous scenes and just didn't make for scary. Then there were the fat zombies. I lost count of how many fat female zombies wearing spandex I saw. It was a lot. The whole suspension of disbelief thing is lost when I have to watch a giant wobbly cellulite filled spandex 'zombie' ass running down the street. Dead creatures wouldn't jiggle like that.

The storyline wasn't terrible. If more effort had been put into the battle scenes, CGI and zombie detail I might actually have enjoyed the movie.",1321315200,5,1132,4.4375
4860410,3,B005QUQRBU,"I hate Asylum, I think they are down there with Troma as the worst in the business. The thing that always gets me is that low budget doesn't have to mean a bad movie, if they only spent more time and effort on what they did, they could actually make a movie worth watching. When the credits rolled and I saw Asylum I nearly turned it off, but I didn't and I'm glad I didn't. This was actually worth watching and surprisingly decent. I'm not raving on it saying it's the greatest or giving it 5 stars like some. But for what it is, it's comparable to Zombie Diaries 1-2 and the German zombie movie Rammbock: Berlin Undead. Guestar57 (the PR man for Asylum) has my blessing to hype this movie, congrats to Asylum squeezing out their first non-turd of a movie. I liked it!",1320451200,,769,4.310344827586207
4860411,5,B005QUQRBU,"I think it's a fun movie that has a few things zombie lovers may not have seen before, and it's got Ving Rhames wielding a sledgehammer. It's not going to reinvent the genre, but it's a solid flick for anyone looking for some zombie action.",1320364800,4,240,4.355555555555555
4860412,3,B005QUQRBU,"Im actually watching this on syfy right now, and i must say it not bad, Its got Ving Rhames for one and a couple of other great and fairly known actors. When i found out that Asylum made this, i couldn't beleive it. Asylum is a mockbuster company that makes rip off of hollywood movies, and they're always terrible, i mean so bad you wonder how the company is still around. This is the only watchable movie of theres, but its not just watchable its actually pretty good. I still feel that Aylum and everyone who works in the company should be kicked square in the jewels for all the crap they spill out.",1319846400,13,603,4.298245614035087
8483817,3,B005QUQRBU,"I've seen plenty of crap from Asylum over the years, but they put a little bit more into this one then usual. Obviously there are the same dialog, acting, and stock footage issues that you normally see in the typical Asylum production, but this sort of nomadic zombie flick is right up my alley. Also, not sure if this is an issue with Amazon Prime or if this is a low grade B flick anomaly, but there's an audio sync issue here.. other than that this is a decent little zombie flick, if you have time to waste and your standards are low.",1529625600,,538,4.233009708737864

I watched the whole thing, because I always hope there's something redeeming in a movie. But not this one. This isn't Z Nation bad. It's ""I want 2 hours of my life back"" bad.

I won't even bother going into details, except to say that it's poor acting (with a few exceptions), terrible screen writing, terrible special effects and overall very lazy directing. You'll see better on YouTube, no joke.",1468454400,,531,4.648936170212766
