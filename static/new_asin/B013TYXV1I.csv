7373541,5,B013TYXV1I,A great Christmas gift for any WWE fan. Mick Foley gives us good cheer.,1447804800,3,71,4.142857142857143
7373542,4,B013TYXV1I,"WWE Hall Of Famer & possibly the #1 Christmas fan in the world (heck, he made his own documentary on Santa Claus & wore Christmas apparel everyday for a full year) in Mick Foley host this DVD set along with his daughter Noelle (get it, NOEL) at his favorite theme park, Santa's Village, on a quest to find Santa while hosting matches & segments of WWE during the holiday of Christmas.

Matches Include:
Boiler Room Brawl Match: Mankind vs Santa Claus - In a nutshell, this was more of a segment than a match with DX taking advantage of Mankind's love for Christmas by having him fight a bunch of Santa Clause's along with the Mean Street Posse as well. This was less than 5 minutes & nothing more past a segment.
""RAW"" Dec. '99
[Blu-Ray Edition of Falls Count Anywhere]

No Ho-Ho-Holds Barred Match: Mick Foley vs. J.B.L. - This was a battle of ""Good Santa vs. Bad Santa"" that saw weapons used from a sack of toys to salad tongs in a match that was more of a segment than an actual match but still entertaining.
Tribute To The Troops '05

Xanta Klaus vs. Scott Taylor - For those who don't remember Xanta Klaus (consider yourself lucky), he was an evil Santa Claus from the South Pole that ""sold out"" to Ted Dibiase & joined his corporation as this was a quick squash match against the future Scotty 2 Hotty as this was one of those ""blink of you'll miss it"" gimmicks that didn't last too long with the only bright side being that Xanta would eventually find another career years later as a ""hardcore chair swinging freak.""
""Superstars"" Dec. '95

Taijiri Claus vs. Bubba Claus - This was a ""Santa Claus Match"" with both men wrestling in their Santa outfits as Bubba used his brawling & size along with D-Von on the outside to his advantage while Tajiri resorted on his high flying offense & strong kicks taking advantage of whenever Bubba started to get overconfident in a solid match.
""RAW"" Dec. '01

John Cena & Trish Stratus vs. Santino Marella & Beth Phoenix - John Cena's original partner, Kelly Kelly, was unable to appear causing Cena to be given an early Christmas present from Santa (sitting the front row) in Trish Stratus' first match back since her retirement two years earlier in a short encounter that had some comedy elements with Santino & Cena along with a ""dream match"" between the most dominate divas of the past decade in Trish & Beth in a fun match that was all about country of Canada getting a present in Trish Status' one night return.
""RAW"" Dec. '08

Kofi Kingston vs. Tyson Kidd - Both men showcased their athleticism early on as Kidd attempted to keep Kofi grounded at a slow pace while Kofi picked up the pace with various kicks & aerial offense as this was all about one man making the classic Christmas story come true by seeing a live flying red nosed reindeer.
""SmackDown"" Nov. '11

Miracle On 34th Street Fight Match: Randy Orton vs. David Otunga - This got taken to the floor quickly with Orton not only dominating using the usual environment & the special Christmas decorations from Christmas trees to a metal sheet with holiday cookies as the match got taken up the ramp to the stage area with gifts being thrown all over the place in what was such an entertaining match in this environment that you saw Randy Orton himself get in the holiday spirit showing that he was having a fun time.
""SmackDown"" Nov. '11

All I Want For Christmas Battle Royal - The winner of this match would be granted one wish from ""Santa Foley"" as this match had some highlights such as a face off between two of the biggest & baddest in the ring, one man so dominate that it came down to other's making an alliance to not only eliminate him but someone else ""legally"" in the match, the match spilling to the outside at one point, and when it got down to the final two.
""SmackDown"" Nov. '11

Miracle On 34th Street Fight Match: John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio - This was a result of what happened earlier in the night with Del Rio & Santa to the point where Ricardo was so upset that he couldn't do his normal ring introduction while Del Rio kept pleading his case of it being an accident only to fall of deaf ears as both men used different weapons around ringside from the microphone to the steps while each man kept opening presents around ringside & the stage area only for them to have completely different results each time to the point where the facial reactions to some of the gifts were just absolutely priceless along with Ricardo's involvement being nothing short of entertaining.
""RAW"" Dec. '12

Good Santa (Mark Henry) vs. Bad Santa (Damien Sandow) - This was the ""Battle For Christmas"" in a glorified street fight that saw different weapons used from a toilet to fire extinguisher along with holiday inspired items & presents with different results for each Santa afterwords in a short but funny contest.
""RAW"" Dec. '13

Christmas Present On A Pole Match: Dolph Ziggler vs. Fandango - The winner of this match would receive an Intercontinental Championship match with both men having the same strategy of going for the poll right away after each major offensive move as you had some moments like one man hitting the other so hard that they both fell off the top turnbuckle & each man being knocked off the pole hitting something painful on the way down in a match that was good for what it was with ""pole"" matches being very limited in what you can do (just watch WCW in 2000.)
""RAW"" Dec. '13

Alicia Fox, Emma, Naomi vs. Paige, Cameron, Summer Rae - Each of the divas wore their ""Santa's Little Helper"" outfits with some going with a more non-traditional look in a basic tag match that saw one team single out a member of the opposing team building to the hot tag with the action eventually breaking down between all six divas with one big move after another with one diva winning the match for her team & keeping her hat on in the process.
""RAW"" Dec. '14

Miracle On 34th Street Fight Match: Dean Ambrose vs. Bray Wyatt - Both men started trading fist right away with the action being taken to the outside with both men using whatever they could get their hands on around ringside from beating on each other with Christmas trees to diving through a stack of presents with the fight making it's way to the stage area & back to the ring as they traded punches & exchanged big blows against each other while using more weapons in unique ways to just beat on each other including sacrificing themselves just to hurt their opponent with some moves delivered that you were unsure who got the worst effect from it.  If anyone has been their previous (Survivor Series, T.L.C., Boot Camp Match) or following (Ambulance) matches then you knew exactly what to expect here in that this was a physical fight but had it's entertaining moments with the holiday gifts & weapons.
""RAW"" Dec. '14

Other moments include Bobby Heenan trying to ruin Christmas on Prime Time Wrestling, Alberto Del Rio's ""accident"" with Santa, and highlights of superstars reading their own versions of ""Twas The Night Before Christmas.""  This is one of those ""budget"" WWE sets with a specific theme that you can watch in one setting so if your expecting five star classics then this isn't here as this was all about WWE celebrating Christmas with Mick Foley & his daughter adding to the festivities so it's an enjoyable release if you take it for what it is.",1447027200,,7346,4.54119425547997

8728792,3,B013TYXV1I,"This DVD is Mick Foley and his daughter Noelle going around Santa's Village looking for Santa while reminiscing about old WWE/WWF matches that had a Christmas theme.  The scenes with the Foleys in them do get a chuckle out of you once in a while because let's face it, Mick Foley is a pretty funny guy!

The scenes with the wrestling in them are also good because you get to see these classic matches.  My favorite match was the Boiler Room Brawl between Mick and Santa, that was always one of my favs!

It's a nice trip down memory lane and worth watching.  Check it out!",1493596800,,572,4.3584905660377355
8728793,5,B013TYXV1I,"The DVD had all the Christmas-themed matches & segments that I can fondly remember up to the year the DVD came out. Also as my favorites, including Roddy Piper putting a stop to anti-Santa Bobby Heenan & Randy Orton vs. David Otunga (where Orton used every X-mas item there!). Just excellent.",1485302400,,292,4.745098039215686

8728799,5,B013TYXV1I,"I personally wanted a Holiday themed WWE DVD for a long time & I really enjoy some of these more random single disc release anyways, so I was really happy when this one was announced. There aren't really any 5-Star matches on the set except for maybe Dean Ambrose vs. Bray Wyatt. It's more so a collection of fun moments with the occasional, usually pretty short, holiday themed match thrown in but overall I'm still pretty happy with it & I'll surely be popping it into my blu-ray player every December!",1450137600,3,504,4.549450549450549
8728800,4,B013TYXV1I,"I came across this DVD at a record store and noticed that WWE had released a DVD related to Christmas. Now I had to look online to see what the contents of the DVD were and from what I saw, it consisted of Christmas moments, and matches from around the holiday season. As someone who likes Christmas, I figured that I should check it out.

Regarding the matches on the DVD, in no way did I expect any 5-star epic matches, but that is not to say that I was not entertained at all. It was fun to see a montage from Christmas moments in the past, and also a couple of ""Miracle on 34th Street Fights,"" both of which were fun to watch.

As for the main part of the DVD, I didn't mind Mick Foley and his daughter searching for Santa Claus. It was a fun portion of the DVD.

Overall, I have to say that I found something related to wrestling that I could watch during the holiday season. However, the DVD could have included more content, but it's okay. I am hoping that WWE puts out another holiday-themed DVD, as long as they don't include when DX mooned the crowd, or a part involving an overweight male stripper at Armageddon 2006. With WWE being PG-rated, I doubt that those two moments would make it.",1449705600,2,1199,4.25
