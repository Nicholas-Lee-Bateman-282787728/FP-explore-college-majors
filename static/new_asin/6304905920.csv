938718,1,6304905920,"Sometimes i wonder why some movies such like this, really exist!!
Although i love Carmen Electra, I wouldn't ever recommend this film to anyone...
It is what we call, a useless movie! It has nothing to offer and absolutely nothing worth seeing except for the naked body of the sexy protagonist... I own it only because of her, and although i hadn't expected it to be good, it was terrible!! It dissapointed me...",1036281600,9,412,4.657534246575342
938719,5,6304905920,I cant believe some of the reviews to this movie.  I thought this movie totally rocked. Like for instance where carmen pours a jug of milk down herself its so hot.  To give this movie such a harsh review leaves me wondering what the hells wrong with you.,992908800,5,254,4.270833333333333
938720,2,6304905920,"As a movie destined for 'USA Up All Night' (without any need to edit it for television even),'Legend of the Raven' is dead average. As a movie from  the people who brought us 'Sgt. Kabuki Man, NYPD' and the 'Toxic Avenger'  flicks, it's a huge dissapointment.
'The Chosen-Legend of the Raven' is  the story of a young woman [Carmen Electra] who is chosen by birthright and  circumstance to take up her family mantle (represented by a necklace with  mystical powers) to become the Raven fight against an Evil that threatens  to swallow the world. The film depicts her transformation and her first  battle against said evil, manifested in the Wolf [Shauna Sand].
Nice  concept, exceedingly bad execution. The script is very nearly devoid of  focus, the acting is almost universally bad (Shauna Sand shows some  glimmers of talent, or maybe just carries herself with natural intensity...  but this is offset by Carmen Electra's thoroughly wooden and amateurish  performance), and the fight scenes are as lame as any ever committed to  film. There's not even anything remarkable about the camera work or  costuming, and there's no humour to speak of. To top it off, the Raven's  enemies seem more pathetic than truly threatening.
The only thing I can  think of to recommend this film is that it *did* manage to hold my  attention. Unlike many other poorly made films the creators here at least  had a sense of pacing.
My advice? Pass on this one unless you're the  world's biggest Carmen Electra or Shauna Sand fan. If you're looking for a  film with woman superheroes, get 'The Heroic Trio' or its sequel 'The  Exceutioners.' (The latter is more in line with the tone of 'Legend of the  Raven, but is a vastly superior flick.)",966902400,4,1723,4.808873720136519
938721,1,6304905920,"I wasn't expecting a theatrical master piece, but this one leaves a lot to be desired.  Some very lovely ladies, but not enough shots of them to cover for the bad plot.  I saw this on DVD, and didn't like the format.  You couldn't go straight to ""PLAY"".  I also couldn't get rid of  the Directors commentary with the first section.  I finally got rid of it  by the second, and I don't have this problem with other DVD's I own.  (on  the other one's I own, you have to chose that option, it doesn't  automatically come on, though there may be a flaw in my copy) As for the  plot, it was basically rehashed ideas from hundreds of other B movies,  except this one was more vague.  I did like the all womens costumes  though.",960854400,2,721,4.205882352941177
938722,3,6304905920,"This film is a pretty bad one.  It has the aura of a late night erotic thriller but is just too silly.
If you are a Troma fan, you may be able to get through some of the silly parts.  One of my favorite quotes in the  film is Shawna Sand-Lamas ""You have the power.""  (Not to mention  her little interview in the extras of the DVD.)  She has my vote for  funniest low budget beauty that cannot act at all.  Her scenes look like  she's in pain trying to get her lines out.  Carmen Electra shines in this  film though (probably due to her surrounding actors).
I was hoping for a  more action filled superhero film in the lines of The Demolitionist and  Black Scorpion, but it wasn't.  As a matter of fact there isn't much butt  stomping by Electra in her nice superhero outfit at all.
The big bonus to  this one is that the women cast in the film are sexy as hell.  Huge amounts  of cleavage running away from the bad guys.  Every film has it's good  qualities.
The film tries to take itself a little too seriously most of  the time, when it could have been made to be a hilarious low budget sexy  action film.  It should appeal to people that like late night erotic  thrillers and don't mind miniscule budget movies.",956620800,4,1214,4.223684210526316

7879280,3,6304905920,"For fans of the cult classic, The Crow, its femme fatale counterpart has arrived! This movie is as cheesy as superhero movies come, but the fact that it was made in 1998 and features its title character in scantily clad superhero apparel (sans cape) as well as an uncomfortable-looking steel mask makes this movie a favorite among comic book geeks. It's so similar to Brandon Lee's swan song that it basically has the same typeface, and 'raven' is in the title, so both movies got the bird theme going on. The scene where she walks into the bar definitely screams ""I'm here, bitch!"" It's nice to know that a sexy vixen like Carmen Electra can kick ass and take names, all while looking good at the same time.",1305158400,,708,4.5390625
7879281,2,6304905920,"Much of the plot didn't make sense, and the acting was B- at best.  Thus, one was hoping for a little more female display that frankly never materialized.  With several hot chicks, there's only one scene of any consequence and that's with Carmen who's beautiful face and overall figure is frankly diminished by an apparently stiff set of implants.  But, that's the world these days.  So, if you're a Carmen Electra fan, it's still a good addition to your video library.",1106092800,6,469,4.753086419753086
