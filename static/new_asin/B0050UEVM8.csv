4518508,1,B0050UEVM8,"Was not at all what I thought this was! By the cover you would think this was a movie season that was about horses. This is not a movie!!! It is a dvd that talks about horses and rodeos and such. The reason I thought it was a movie and not a 'talking about rodeos and what horses are best for this type of thing' was because it said: ""Go behind the scenes to see just what it takes to make a barrel racing horse, a performing horse, a trail riding horse and even a police horse! Interviews with trainers, handlers, riders, and owners provide an up close and personal look at the various roles of this beautiful and majestic animal."" So I thought that those would just be behind the scenes things but it is in fact what this dvd is. So if you are looking for a movie story about horses, know this is NOT a movie.

Note: I rated this 1 star because my experience. The dvd was in perfect condition and shipped fast so that is not a reflection on those things.",1357689600,,956,4.139784946236559

4518510,5,B0050UEVM8,"I bought World of Horses 1 and 2 for my children and my niece.  While the episodes can sometimes be a little slow to watch, they are very good for learning about horses and how they're still used in our society today.  The quality could've been better by breaking the episodes up over 4 discs instead of squeezing them on two discs, but they are very watchable and educational.",1354838400,,377,4.449275362318841

4518520,5,B0050UEVM8,"Canadian horseman John Scott hosts this very entertaining and informative TV series. Each season (1 and 2) has 13 episodes, averaging 23 mins per episode, so each dvd runs 5 hours (!) utilizing both sides of each disc.
Season 2 includes subjects such as: The Trail Riding Horse; The Police Horse; The First Nations Horse; The Outriding Horse; The Three-Day Eventing Horse, etc.
I've never owned a horse (but oh, how I would love to) so for me this is a privileged look, up close and personal, into the lives of these horses, horse owners, trainers and the worlds they inhabit. I am particularly impressed by the love and kindness shown to these magical creatures, especially the ""gentling"" technique of training.  Impressive cinematography and insightful commentary contribute to a lovingly produced series, filmed in Canada.
I'm also impressed by how much they manage to pack into each episode: modern day-to-day running of farms, stables and training facilities; historical perspective; documentary footage, all at such a smooth pace with none of the typical in-your-face, loud, screaming presentation that pervades many TV shows these days.
The price I paid for both seasons on Amazon was an absolute bargain for such enjoyable entertainment, and if you decide to own them for yourself I do hope you will enjoy them as much as I do.
Sorry if I sound a bit too upbeat about these two gems, but they really are super!",1374451200,2,1418,4.957983193277311
