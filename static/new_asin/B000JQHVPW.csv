8433363,3,B000JQHVPW,"The description for this item says the 4 programs are on two discs, however it is not.  The package I received was a new, unopened package.  On the outside of the package is says ""on 2 discs"", but there was only 1 disc in the package.  All of the advertised programs are on the one disc, but there is no menu; all programs run back-to-back so you have to fast-forward or skip-to-a-scene to find the individual programs. What a pain!  I don't mind that all programs are on one disc.  The fact that the disc has no menu system is what I don't like.  The content of the programs are okay and what I expected.",1221609600,,605,4.217391304347826
