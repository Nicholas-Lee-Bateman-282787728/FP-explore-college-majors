5006125,5,B006MQ0FRE,"I was looking for a video of ""The Raven"" to use with my students.  This video worked perfectly.  The oral interpretation is great and the visuals match perfectly.  Some of the images, particularly the grim reaper, are a little strong but still they lend well to the overall presentation.",1319241600,,287,4.816326530612245
5006126,5,B006MQ0FRE,"I teach 11th grade American Literature, and I was completely impressed with this interpretation of the classic poem. It's tough to find an updated, high-interest video about The Raven that isn't hokey, but this fits the ticket. The students were really into it and it allowed them to understand the poem so much better, too!",1301529600,,324,4.909090909090909
5006127,4,B006MQ0FRE,"I was looking for something a little different for my Poe class.  This exactly fits the bill.  More than just a narration.  It is beautifully read, but you also get engaging images. Isn't so long that students will lose interest.  This is a great find.",1301011200,,252,4.533333333333333
5006128,5,B006MQ0FRE,I teach Edgar Allan Poe in my 8th grade ELA classes.  The students love his writings.  I had been looking for a great adaptation of The Raven.  This has great illustrations and it was easy for the students to understand.  I would strongly recommend this for teachers and anyone else who likes Poe's work.,1300406400,,304,4.574074074074074
5006129,5,B006MQ0FRE,"I showed this to my high school English students, and they really enjoyed it. The illustrations are imaginative and thoughtful, the music and sound effects are topnotch (the music reminds me of Hitchcock's composer, Bernard Herrmann), and the voice-over narration is compelling (the narrator speaks in a wonderfully low and evocative voice). Plus, the entire video clocks in at eleven minutes (short but sweet, which is what teenagers love). Absolutely worth buying. I look forward to more Poe-related products from Taletube.",1292630400,,525,5.493827160493828
5006130,5,B006MQ0FRE,"""Highly recommended!! Excellent quality! My students will love these DVDs..since they will be able to relate to the fantastic illustrations!! Thank you for shipping so quickly!!!""",1290816000,,179,5.923076923076923
5006131,5,B006MQ0FRE,"As mentioned in my review of
<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Edgar-Allan-Poe-Classic-Compilation-The-Cask-of-Amontillado-and-the-Tell-Tale-Heart/dp/B001MQ36WA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Edgar Allan Poe Classic Compilation: The Cask of Amontillado and the Tell Tale Heart</a>

I am using this DVD series to help my students get into Edgar Allen Poe in a medium they will be familiar with. That said, I ordered this one immediately after showing the first since It was such a great success with the students. And this one delivers the same level of quality as the other. I was concerned since ""The Raven"" can be very complex and difficult to truly understand for some. But i didn't need to be, this DVD tells the whole unabridged poem. And with the aid of the on screen text it becomes much easier for those unfamiliar with Poe's work to follow.

Personally, I used the version with subtitles. So that my students could read along while they watched, and as i mentioned before hopefully have an easier time understanding. Which, according to them did in fact help them understand the material, as well as helping them remember portions of it later on when i tested them. Compared to other methods I have used in the past, I would have to say these DVD's have been the most successful and thought provoking in my students thus far.  I have yet to see them so interested in classic literature, it really is gratifying to see. And i will continue to utilize these DVD's for my future classes, as i doubt i will find anything which displays the material in a better, easier to understand format.

I would love to see more of the classics done in the same fashion! So once again thank you Taletube for providing such a valuable teaching resource.  I will be recommending these DVD's to my co-workers for use in their classes as well.",1287014400,,1864,5.098360655737705
5006132,5,B006MQ0FRE,"I am teacher who got this for their 9th graders,English class. I loved it and the students loved it. I love how it was 100% unabridged and true to the poem. The students loved it because they gained a much deeper level of understanding.",1287014400,,236,4.386363636363637
8501104,1,B006MQ0FRE,I ordered this as an aid for my sons class and its NOT Poe's The Raven.  Unfortunately I don't know how to seek a refund and I can get no one to take it off my hands,1477353600,,165,3.4594594594594597
8501105,5,B006MQ0FRE,"I have to confess that I did not buy this video, but I did see it on the big screen at the  Poe Film Festival in Richmond, VA.  This film captures the true essence of the Raven poem.  Even more impressive is how the raven responds to the actors which lends to the intensity of the film.",1475107200,,286,3.982456140350877
8501106,5,B006MQ0FRE,Great. My students (Max risk grades 8-12) loves this. A great visual accompaniment to the poem.,1472256000,,95,5.0

8501109,5,B006MQ0FRE,"THE BEST
This release not only has the best version of ""The Raven"", but also includes a biography of Poe and a ""making of"" video.
Many teachers have already commented about using this in the classroom because to them it is ""The Best""!!",1362096000,,235,4.488372093023256
8501110,5,B006MQ0FRE,"The graphics of this video are not only creative and enjoyable, but also effective in facilitating student viewers to make connections and read closely!",1321401600,,152,5.375
8501111,5,B006MQ0FRE,I am a Poe fanatic and am always looking for something visual in my blantant attempts to convert non-readers this American contribution to great literature. Taletube has created a visual feast that enhances the COMPLETE poem. I will watch for more TALES from this group!,1320451200,,270,5.022222222222222
8501112,4,B006MQ0FRE,"If you are an educator, you will like these videos.  These videos are acceptable to show in a classroom since they are still pictures of the story with a narrator in the background telling the tale.  Plus, there is a function on each of these that allows you to have the words of the story appear on the screen.  This helps if you are having students follow along.  I love Poe and it is very hard to find videos that actually match the actual story.  I have a corny one for the Tell-Tale Heart that has a live actor, but it's laughable.  This one adds to my collections, it makes a nice comparison to the one I already have, and it doesn't even require me to get my kids to have a permission slip signed to view it.  It's an exact replica of the story, so it's not commercially made so that it tampers with the original.  It is perfect for my 8th graders.  I'm now looking for one on the Black Cat.  I hope you make one of those soon!  The only problem I have with it is that I had no idea what I was getting.  The other reviews said it was good, but I never knew it would be still pictures and then a narrator in the background.",1320192000,,1129,4.0588235294117645
8501113,4,B006MQ0FRE,"I showed this to my 8th grade ELA class after they read the poem ""The Raven"". They loved it.  The quality was as I had hoped for - not disappointed at all. The length is perfect to be able to show in a single class period and have some immediate feedback/discussion time in the same class. Absolutely got my money's worth and will certainly purchase more taletube products in the future",1320019200,,386,4.436619718309859
