1801751,5,B000077VQI,"I bought my first Karen Voight DVD about a year ago.  She is very easy to follow and no your typical annoying video instructor.
This video is the perfect mix that is recommended for a workout schedule - weights, cardio, and stretching.  If you've ever tried the Self Magazine ""Self Challenge"", this is the perfect video to accompany.  It's everything the challenge recommends on one DVD!!
Thanks to Karen Voight (and Jennifer Kries), I have a completely new body that I hardly recognize and it only took 1 year (I was almost too far gone!!)",1052352000,15,540,4.663157894736842
1801752,4,B000077VQI,"Although I really enjoy this DVD and have used it quite often, the packaging is misleading. You don't get a different workout for eveyday what you get is a different sequencing of the same circuits for any given day. This would have been a better product if the circuts were available from a main menu to put together your own workouts. When pressed for time this offers a decent thirty minute workout that includes a warm up and cool down.",1049760000,11,440,4.5125
1801753,4,B000077VQI,"I bought this video with the impression that there were varying workouts.  I was disappointed that there is really only 1 cardio section that is repeated throughout.  Also the workouts are not for the more advanced exerciser...more beginner to intermediate.  Nevertheless, as always, Karen Voight is a great instructor...she is articulate and precise.  The workout is good for variation but, being more advanced, these workouts would not be fulfilling enough for everyday!",1043712000,12,472,5.513888888888889
1801754,5,B000077VQI,"Karen Voight is phenomenal. Each workout is only a half hour and is labled by the day of the week so it is easy to keep track of which workout comes next. She has some simple, but innovative moves that work out each muscle group. I love the combination of cardio, strength training and yoga on this DVD. Equipment required is minimal. You will need 5-8 lb dumbells, a yoga block and a yoga mat. One thing I think the buyer should know is that each workout may vary with the part of the body you are working on, but each time you focus on that area, it is a repeat of the same clip. For example, the ab workout is the same, the warm up and cool downs are the same, etc. I highly recommend this DVD. Karen teaches proper form expands my workout and I also appreciate that her body is sculpted and healthy looking. Worth the money",1036627200,2,827,4.175
1801765,3,B000077VQI,"Karen Voight has the best stretch DVD on the market 'Pure & Simple Stretch'...this DVD unfortunately is best left to people in shape like Karen. It's a great idea of a workout, one for every day, but she jumps right into the workouts that assume one is already fit. Karen is a great role model but word of caution: start slow with these, even if you don't keep up at first.",1375747200,4,373,4.267605633802817
1801766,3,B000077VQI,"I was so anxious to try these routines, only to find out that most of the DVD is actually a remix of Karen Voight's BURN & FIRM workout, which I already own and have been doing for years.  There was nothing written about ""Slim Physique"" to indicate that was the case.  Even the pictures on the DVD case are nothing like what is actually on the DVD.  Otherwise, the routines are fantastic.  I just wanted to tell anyone who already owns BURN & FIRM, this DVD is not for you.",1290297600,5,473,4.222222222222222
1801767,4,B000077VQI,I like the video because it gives you variety.  It's not just the same thing every time.  There really is a different work-out for each day of the week and each work out works on different parts of the body.  It also adapts for different levels of ability.  I think it is a good video and I am very happy with it.,1241136000,,313,4.0
1801768,5,B000077VQI,"Great DVD. I love the easy to do, realistic workout. You don't get the same boring workout every day. This DVD has a different workout for each day of the week. If you don't like Thursday, then do Monday instead.",1231632000,,212,4.325
1801769,5,B000077VQI,This DVD provides a good variety of workouts. I love the upper body workout and the cardios.,1213488000,,92,4.470588235294118
1801770,3,B000077VQI,"I gave ""Sleek Physique"" three stars, becuase I personally didn't find it very challenging. I hardly broke a sweat with the cardio sections, and the strength training sections barely gave me any sort of burn in my legs or arms. This DVD, however, would be a good beginner workout because Karen does give good cues and explains each exercise move. There is a little bit of cordination and balance required. For example, in the lower body strength section, you do back leg raises standing up with some ballet arm moves. I am not very coordinted and lack some balance, but I found the exercises manageable.

I also gave ""Sleek Physique"" three stars, because after a while doing the same workout segments day after day got a little boring.  For a beginner, though, it might be easier and less frustrating to stick with the same thing as you ease into the discipline of exercising each day.",1202169600,2,884,4.696774193548387
1801771,5,B000077VQI,"This DVD is the best bargain in fitness.  It includes a great variety of exercise types (aerobics, yoga, weight training & abs), all with Karen's superb instruction.  Be warned that this is a remix of previously released workouts, so if you already have an extensive library of Karen's DVDs, you may already have everything on this one.  Even so, it's a must-have for people who take their workouts on the road -- you only need to bring 1 DVD. Many thanks to reviewer Rebecca Johnson, whose extensive description I printed out & keep in the box along with the DVD.",1200355200,5,564,4.62
1801772,4,B000077VQI,"I really enjoy Karen Voight's workouts but would have to say that this one isn't among my favorites.  There are seven 30-minute workouts (one for each day of the week) that target different areas - cardio, strength training, toning.  Each workout is very well developed as you'd expect from Karen, but some of the days repeat routines so you're not really getting seven completely different workouts.  That disappointed me a little.

I think this DVD would be excellent for someone just beginning to workout, but on it's own, I've never seen any results.  Since I try to workout at least 75 minutes a day, I use the segments to supplement other shorter workouts to reach my time goal.  Since the intensity is kind of low for me, these segments are like 30 minute cool-downs for me.",1184025600,6,781,4.705882352941177
1801773,5,B000077VQI,"I disagree with the others who dislike this video. I have Burn & Firm and actually like the sequencing on this DVD better. Yes, there is some repeat material, but all the yoga included is new and great! The Sunday stretching yoga is the best! It is a 30 min floor sequence and includes some very deep stretching with beautiful music by Shastro; very relaxing. All the workouts are fun and not too difficult for us over 40's crowd :o)

It is a similar workout setting as Burn & Firm and also BLT on the ball (another fun and easy routine). I wish the covers looked similar on this style she has produced. This looks like an older tape from the cover photo.

You get 3-1/2 hours of workouts on this tape. I got it on sale for $7.99 which is a great price. Well worth the money. I really like Karen's tapes and this is another good one!",1176595200,9,833,4.232704402515723
1801774,1,B000077VQI,"This video sits in the back and I only pull it out to use the yoga segment every now and then.  Karen is very dull and has little personality.  The entire workout takes place in a boring room and the music was boring as well.  The packaging makes it appear that you will be doing 7 different workouts, but there are only a few segments that are pieced together.  It is a very basic workout which doesn't make me work up a sweat and the weight training segments don't make me sore the next day.",1170892800,4,493,4.157894736842105
1801785,2,B000077VQI,"If you have the Karen Voight video titled ""Burn and Firm"" Circuit Training - don't bother with this product.  It is the same thing!!!  Burn & Firm is a great work out and what Slim Physique does is breaks down Burn & Firm by taking different segments of it and having you do part of it each day for 30 minutes.  For example - on Monday you will do the lower body workout - on Tuesday you may do the upper body workout.  Both of these are directly from Burn & Firm which you can break down by yourself.  The only new thing on this DVD is the yoga - which I'm guessing is from one of her other DVDs.  I was greatly disappointed with this purchase.  If you don't have Burn & Firm, this tape will give you a good workout - just don't buy both.",1168300800,11,739,3.9863945578231292
1801786,4,B000077VQI,it is a good home workout for someone who is looking to get back into shape but isn't ready to hit the gym again just yet. it is not a difficult workout but it was good for me after having a child.  i didn't sweat a lot but it got me moving and i could sit my child next to me and keep an eye on him.  i compare it to a brisk 30 minute walk.,1167955200,2,341,3.473684210526316
1801787,5,B000077VQI,"I have a lot of Karen Voight tapes.  She is very articulate and entuziastic trainer which helps a lot.  Most of her tapes including this one for the ""advance beginners"".  Yoga part (on this tape)is difficult and you should be really flexible to do that.  Aerobic part is challenging, but doable.  The most I like Monday & Thursday parts which I do very often.  I add 5 min abs routine and feel very good.",1143158400,3,404,4.391891891891892
1801788,1,B000077VQI,"I definitely should have rented this first.  One of my favorite workout videos is Karen's ""Burn and Firm"".  But I was getting bored with it.  So, I bought this one to spice it up...and the first day was just portions of ""Burn & Firm""!  I was definitely disappointed, and have not picked it up again.",1113177600,12,299,4.381818181818182
1801789,5,B000077VQI,"I have recently gotten into Karen Voight's style of aerobics and I love her!  Her personality is totally my style.  She's real, feminine and athletic all at the same time.  She teaches simple, very effective and efficient moves that really make a difference in your body.  I used to be gung ho for the Firm series, and although I still like them- I really like Karen's moves a lot more.  She doesn't stress your body out like The Firm seems too.  Perhaps I was overdoing the Firm.  I don't know, but I really have gotten into the more gentle yet efficient lengthening cardio moves that Karen uses. It has changed the way I look at exercising. My body has a more sleek look now that Karen is my choice instructor rather than the Firm :)  AND- I look forward to exercising a lot more now too! If you eat healthy and you exercise with Karen most days, you will see a difference. This DVD is a great intro to Karen's stuff... If you find yourself wanting more cardio after her cardio, just pair it with a nice walk or run. It's perfect for me and may be for you too!",1106524800,10,1062,4.275
1801790,4,B000077VQI,"This workout is a little too bland for me, and while each day has a different workout, there are some repeats of sections. The cardio is the same no matter which day you do it; same with the upper and lower body toning as well as the yoga. Some days you have a choice which workout you want to do and it will occupy you. I enjoy this for something different; I fit this in one week out of every month or two just to shake up my routine a little bit.",1090454400,10,449,3.891304347826087
1801791,5,B000077VQI,This is my first Karen Voight exercise DVD and I love it! There is good variety (although some days are repeated segments). The overall result is a great balance. I especially enjoy her cardio segments and the yoga workouts. I have a number of exercise videos/DVDs and Karen Voight is by far the best instructor I've seen so far. I will definitely buy more of her products!,1081468800,5,373,4.582089552238806
1801792,4,B000077VQI,"I really enjoy working out with Karen Voight, but I was somewhat dissapointed with this video.  Yes, each segment of each workout is repeated depending on what day and workout you choose, but the problem I had is there is no cooldown from the cardio to the strength training.  You go from high intensity to lying on the floor doing abs in 5 seconds.  I have to stop my DVD and bring my heart rate down before moving on.  But this is a good video if you only have a limited time to squeeze exercise in.  While you don't do more than 20 minutes of cardio, the routine is intense and really gets your heart rate up.  I'll continue to use this video as a supplement when I have limited time, but I'll rely on Karen's longer workouts as my primary exercise.",1076457600,6,752,4.26056338028169
1801793,5,B000077VQI,"While this is an interesting concept, will it work for you?

Do you only have 30 minutes a day for a workout? Then, this might be a great solution. Karen has created a variety of mix 'n match workouts. All you do is select the day of the workout. If you are used to working out for an hour, you might have to combine two days.

Monday (Cardio & Lower Body Strength): This is an interesting combination of small cardio segments that seem to increase in intensity. You end the workout with a short floor routine and some stretches.

Tuesday (Yoga Strength): Karen shows you how to get the most out of each move. She will work your body into a finely tuned fitness machine. Compared to other 45-60 minute yoga workouts I have, this seemed to be a very quick workout for me, so adding 40 minutes of walking will take this to a new level. You can do the walking before the yoga and it will warm your muscles so you can go deeper into the stretches.

Wednesday (Cardio & Abdominal Strength): Aerobics workout in which you start with a warm-up routine, then move into more energetic moves. I thought the ""bunny hops"" were kinda cute. It is like using a jump rope without the rope. Karen is a bundle of high energy and takes you from simple moves to complex routines that not only challenge your body, you have to stay very aware and the footwork is very creative. The aerobics workout is followed by floor routines for abs. Some stretching at the end.

Thursday (Upper & Lower Body Strength): You start with the cardio workout and then work your way into using weights while standing. Lots of upper body work and then you go to the mat and continue working out your upper body. The cool down has some lower body stretches.

Friday (Abdominals & Yoga Stretch OR Yoga Strength): You start with Abdominals and have to get to you mat very quickly. In fact, you might want to be flat on your back with the remote in hand before you even start. Karen seems to be famous for jumping right into the workout, so this is something you have to be aware of. There is no explanation before each workout. The explanations are all during the workouts and the instruction is refined and you make the most of each move. The Yoga workout is on an oriental carpet and is quite a beautiful routine due to the carpet, the music and the lighting, wood floor, etc. This is my favorite section on the DVD. Karen's black cat-suit type outfit also sparkles. This section of the workout is sort of magical and relaxing. I'd like to see more workouts like this! An entire DVD of stretching routines would be bliss. (If you love this section of the workout, you might also enjoy YOGASCULPT.)

Saturday (Cardio & Upper Body Strength): Again, you start with an aerobics routine. You will notice the ""swimming"" from a workout she did with Elle Macpherson in ""Your Personal Best."" Karen definitely seems to have a lot of ""signature moves"" which make her routines easier to do in the long run. Your body knows how it is supposed to move and it is very satisfying to find moves you have learned in other Voight workouts. Karen is quite creative and always seems to be in a state of constant change because she makes up new moves in addition to the old ones, so you really have to focus. Her workouts are as much for the mind as the body. Cardio Circuit Energy Boost  is followed by the weight workout you did on Thursday.

Sunday (Yoga Stretch): I started with this routine. It has a nice flow and there are plenty of creative poses. The stretches do seem designed for the very slim as there are some poses in which you literally twist yourself into a pretzel. Never fear, there are only a few of those poses and you can work your way to that level of flexibility.

Tools: hand weights, yoga mat, two blocks and optional foot stool.

Karen presents each workout in a no-nonsense style. She gets right to working out. So, have all your equipment ready to go. You won't have time to go find your yoga mat, weights or block once you start the workout. For the most part, the footwork wasn't too fancy, but there are a few times I just went back to walking until I could figure out the routine. If you are used to aerobic workouts and want a new challenge, Karen will give your mind a workout too. She has a friendly instruction style and a pleasant voice.

Karen Voight has always been an inspiration to me. Her workouts really motivate me. If you enjoy this workout, you might also want to try: Ultimate Circuit Training. It also has B.L.T. on a ball workout, so you don't have to buy the additional DVD.

""Sleek Physique"" is a fun DVD to use every now and then for a complete week. It gives you a break from trying to figure out which workout you are supposed to be doing. Karen does the organizing for you. This is perfect to take with you on vacation so you don't get out of your workout routine.

This DVD has previews of other workouts and links to Karen's
website so you can purchase exercise equipment. Throughout this workout, Karen has a workout partner.

All of the routines are from previous exercise dvd's.  What's different about this dvd is that she has created a schedule to perform the exercises for every day of the week.  For example on Monday you would do cardio and lower body exercises for 30 minutes.  On Thursday you would work on your upper and lower body.
