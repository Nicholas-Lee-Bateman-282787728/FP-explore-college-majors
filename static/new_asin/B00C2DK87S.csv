8576504,3,B00C2DK87S,"There are two boxed DVD sets for Unit One (at least), one for the American market and one for European. Unit One originally appeared as 4 seasons, including 32 episodes. Season 1 had episodes 1-9; Season 2 had episodes 10-16, Season 3 had episodes 17-30 and the final Season 4 had only two episodes: 31 and 32. I have no clue why Danish TV would call two episodes ""a season"" but that's neither here nor there. The American DVD sets provide all 32 episodes in 3 DVD sets, labeled as ""SETS."" The first two sets have 12 episodes each, which means they include both full Seasons 1 and 2 and run over halfway thru Season 3. Then the US-format ""SET 3"" includes the last 6 episodes of Season 3 as well as the final 2 episodes of Season 4.

How's that for confusing? It's made worse because the European market DVD sets have been released entitled ""SERIES"" and there are 4 of them, with the last one, the one I'm reviewing here, containing EXACTLY the same material as the US SET #3. There is NO US Set #4, of course, since there are no episodes beyond #32.

Why do I give this 3 stars? Well, Unit One in overall terms I'd grade as 5 stars, although I would say the series declined to 4 stars toward the end. (Read my review of the US Set 3 for details why.) I'm downgrading THIS set a star because of the confusing presentation. Americans who ordered off Amazon are going to naturally gravitate from buying the first 3 American ""sets"" to considering purchasing THIS PAL-format ""Series 4"", particularly if they have an all-region DVD player. I did, and didn't discover my error until I started watching this set/series. I would suggest the packager could avoid all this confusion by listing the exact episode numbers on each box. The American releases do this, clearly labeling the 3 sets as containing EPISODES #1-12, EPISODES #13-24 and EPISODES #25-32 right on the bottom of the cover artwork. THIS Series 4 PAL-format only mentions in the small print on the back (which cannot be accessed from their display page on Amazon) that ""Season 4 consists of 8 full length episodes"" which is again confusing since Season 4 as defined by Danish TV consists of only the final two episodes.

Yes, I will be returning this set since it's a dupe for me. Which is sad since I was looking forward to more episodes of this first-rate Nordic Noir detective series!",1442361600,3,2343,4.534278959810875
8576505,5,B00C2DK87S,"All the episodes of Unit 1 are great. I like Mads M and Charlotte F a lot. Stories good, character relationships multi faceted. I have mostly Region 2 versions, bought a Code Free player for this series and older Wallanders.  Now it seems MHZ has USA format versions.  I am not 100%sure I have the last 2 episodes according to Wikipedia. Since I have discovered NORDIC Noir yrs ago, I don't really bother with commercial American TV ""stuff"". If you takea look at my other lists or reviews you'll find other gems....ones that I found out about thru amazon reviews and IMDB.",1419465600,2,572,4.598039215686274
