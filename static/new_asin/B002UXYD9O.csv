3993626,4,B002UXYD9O,"This season is great. I have watched all of seasons 1-5 and feel the first three seasons have been the best. I'm looking forward to the last season and believe in all this Little Mosque on the Prairie is a cute, funny positive show that everyone should watch.",1345507200,3,259,4.416666666666667
3993627,5,B002UXYD9O,"I love, love, love this family-friendly series!  With no swearing, nudity or sexual innuendo, it still manages to be funny -- why can't we get more of this in the States?  For those who have missed this wonderful series, the main characters are:

Amaar -- imam of the mosque.  He was a lawyer at his father's Toronto law firm before he decided to become an imam.

Yasir Hamoudi -- a rather secular Muslim who owns a construction company and shows up for Friday prayers.  He is the one responsible for finding a place to have a mosque -- a difficult task that is solved when he rents the parish hall of the Anglican Church (you really need to see the first season!).  He is the consumate romantic, passionately devoted to his wife.

Sara Hamoudi -- Yasir's wife, who was an Anglican until she converted to Islam when she married Yasir.  Her devotion to Islam is limited to Friday prayers.

Rayyan Hamoudi -- raised by secular parents, the daughter of Sara and Yasser is an outspoken feminist doctor who is also a devout Muslim who wears the hijab (headscarf).  When her parents stray too far off the path, Rayyan is there to remind them of Islamic behavior.

Babar Saddiqi -- brilliant economist & fundamentalist Pakistani Muslim who butts heads with Rayyan and Amaar (whom he doesn't consider a ""real"" imam becaus he doesn't have a beard).  He is raising a teenage daughter by himself because his wife divorced him.

Fatima -- Nigerian Muslim widow who runs a cafe.  She wears hijab and often agrees with Babar or Rayyan on topics related to Islam.

Fred Tupper -- the local conservative (to the point of paranoia) talk show host. Always looking into this wierd religion & a bit paranoid about his Muslim neighbors.  It doesn't stop him from hanging out at Fatima's cafe, though!

Rev. McGee -- the lovable leader of the Anglican church where the mosque has its home.

This season introduced love stories -- Babar falls in love (briefly), Rayyan falls in love (less briefly).  As always, we learn about Islam without realizing how much we are learning.  The first season seemed to have more of that, but now that the audience is (presumably) more knowledgeable, there is not as much focus on differences.  My personal favorite is ""Ban the Burka"": a new woman shows up at the mosque, wearing the niqab (face veil).  All that can be seen are her eyes.  Naturally, Babar, the fundamentalist Pakistani Muslim falls in love with the wonderful, modest Muslim woman.  A truly hilarious episode, especially when he is trying to get Yasser, the consumate romantic, to teach him how to talk to a woman -- something he never learned in his first marriage.  (Yasser:  Well, how did you meet your wife?  Babar:  On our wedding day.).

My second favorite has to be ""The Five Year Plan"", where we find out a bit about where various characters were five years ago  -- nice bit of background and explains some of the current day actions.

Also good are the episodes about the ""No Fly List"" and ""Spy Something or Get Out"", which both touch humorously on government perception of Muslims -- and Muslims perception of government.

""Mercy Beet"", ""Wheat Week"" and ""Welcome to Mercy"" were ok, but not as much fun for me.  Fortunately, they are a small portion of the 20 episodes in this set -- and even the worst isn't that bad.  I find there is always something to like in an episode.

The introduction of J.J. near the end of the season built some nice romantic tension, as he is obviously a rival for Amaar.  Up until now, there has been no romantic interacton between Amaar and Rayyan, but he is an obvious choice (young, handsome, etc) for a match for Rayyan.  Then J.J., whom Rayyan remembers as a geeky kid, comes to town.  Guess what?  The geek has grown into a tall handsome man.  How is Amaar going to handle this?  Or doesn't he care?  (Watch the show to find out!)

The show has just finished its 5th season and I can't wait for it to be out on DVD so I can buy it!  Highly recommend this series for the whole family!",1305331200,4,4006,4.572433192686357

8381591,2,B002UXYD9O,"Gets boring after about 6-7 episodes. I mean, nice idea, love love, Muslims are just people too, with all the usual humanoid limitations. But this is just pedestrian situation comedy. But  Good start to dealing with the issues.",1503446400,,227,4.973684210526316

8381598,5,B002UXYD9O,I wish that this show/concept would be accepted in mainstream USA.  It is so charming and endearing.  The lead in music is addictive.,1435881600,,133,4.739130434782608
8381599,3,B002UXYD9O,"First of all, let me tell you something about myself, to make sense of my evaluation: I am eighty. I am a European (not a U.S. citizen). I am a Muslim convert. I just got the first TV intended for my own use (there were two previous TVs in my life: the first for my daughter, in the sixties, the second for my husband, in the eighties & nineties; that is when I watched a few programs with him: Startrek (the second wave, not that stupid first series, and certainly not that jingoistic last production, the ""prequel"" which suffered greatly from being made right after the attack on the twin towers. I am not a TV watcher, not so much because I don't like what is on TV but commercials (and perhaps capitalism in general) make me nauseous. I don't think there is anything on TV I ever would give five stars to. And although I now have a 60-inch monster, I have used it exclusively to play DVDs and tapes.

I don't think the characters and situations of ""Little Mosque"" are particularly unusual. But since the show deals with issues that have that have also irked me at my own mosque--for example, the totally unnecessary sexism coming from the various Muslims' ethnic culture (totally unnecessary in the framework of Islam and its founder). I feel relatively well represented by the character of Rayyan. I assume that Sarah is a Muslim to please her husband, or more likely in an effort to appease her unappeasable mother-in-law (I had one like that; she got herself a larger apartment on my wedding day so that my husband could move in with her); since Muslim men are allowed to marry anyone of the opposite sex, even atheists and scientologists, Sarah had no need to convert; and I consider her, at best, a Muslim in name only.

The first season was quite pedestrian, but it established characters, and rounded them out somewhat. Seasons two and three, I might give four stars to. (Just to establish what I might give five stars to Satijit Ray's ""Music Room"", or to ""Rasho Mon""--or ""The Battle of the Casbah,"" for its political relevance to present-day U.S.A.; I cannot think of one TV show I would give five stars to, even though I might have enjoyed them (I have also watched ""Startrek: Next Generation"" and ""L.A. Law"" because my husband was watching them).

Getting back to ""Little Mosque"", I am going to watch tonight season 6, disc 1: I am feeling not that the show is running out of steam, but that it already has done so. There are fewer characters. I feel that Reverend Thorne is a pointless monster, totally two-dimensional, while his predecessor is a human being. Baber at least has ability as a mathematician / statistician; for example, when he taught at his daughter's highschool, the students actually liked him so when Islam is not involved, he can be rational, even witty; and since he is not a specialist in humanities or social sciences, his religious rigidity appear logically justifiable.

So I would call ""Litte Mosque"" a somewhat shallow (but not stupid) entertainment, floating somewhere between two and four stars: that would make three stars a reasonable compromise.",1388188800,3,3092,4.699261992619927
