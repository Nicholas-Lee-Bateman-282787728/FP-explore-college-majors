7943934,1,B00005LC8W,"Incredibly poor print, probably pirated from a bad 16mm  screening -- the projector sound is quite audible throughout and it often skips and rolls.  Amazingly poor quality.

Also, the movie itself is terrible.  I love Peter Sellers and William McGonagall and I was really looking forward to the movie, but it was surreally bad, lame, weird, dumb, and almost entirely unfunny.  Sad to say, it stank.

Buy Poetic Gems to enjoy McGonagall, and buy The Wrong Box and The Party and Dr. Strangelove to enjoy Sellers.
Don't buy this.",1388188800,,526,4.853932584269663
7943935,5,B00005LC8W,"I know it's a great Movie, it has the word great in it's title. Gave it five stars becuase it has 5 stars: Spike Milligan, Peter Sellers, Victor Spinetti, Valetyne Dyall and Charlie Atom. (Actually Charlie makes it only 4&1//2 stars, but has on the bill twice...) Must be agreat movie, as since it arrived it's been on a stack of other unwatched movies I haven't watched yet that are also great, like Black Swan and The Pat Palson Half A Comedy Hour. A must see for the blind. Comes with a special audio track for the deaf.",1309478400,,523,4.346938775510204

7943937,4,B00005LC8W,"The joke is that William McGonagall, famous still today for being the world's worst poet, was actually a not unsuccessful comedian. His humour was peculiarly Scottish, and might best be described as pawky. Instead of rotting away as an unemployed weaver, he made a decent living as a rotten versifier --- and declamatory tragedian. People flocked to hear his recitals because they were so famous for being so awful, and McGonagall cried his way to the bank. The real joke was on those who didn't get the joke. The same applies to this film. In one sense it's abysmal, but that's the point. Most of Spike's work is like this. At the same time he was the author of what the London Times recently called the funniest joke ever written. Still, I can't quite give this supremely barmy performance 5 stars.",1158537600,5,800,4.680851063829787
