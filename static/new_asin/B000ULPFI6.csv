2922330,5,B000ULPFI6,"I purchased this item ahead of time for my 12 month old for Christmas. He is a big LeapFrog fan (they have a lot of episodes on Netflix - we've seen every one they have), and it is pretty much the only show he will watch. So I am positive he will love this as much as he loves the others!!",1408147200,,289,3.7540983606557377

2922332,5,B000ULPFI6,My kids love LeapFrog videos.  They watched this a couple times around Christmas.  Cute video for the price I got it for.,1396569600,,121,4.454545454545454
2922333,2,B000ULPFI6,"I am a fan of the Leap Frog videos and this one is okay but it is really hard for young kids to understand.  It's a cute idea to mimic the classic ""It's A Wonderful Life"" but maybe for 8+ year olds.  This video is kind of depressing because no one in Tad's family has time for him and no one will listen to him despite his begging.  Everyone is too busy getting ready for the soon-to-arrive babies.  His sister hangs up stockings and doesn't hang up his even though he is standing there with her because she hangs up the baby's stocking and says, ""Sorry Tad, there's no room for you.""  That is pretty mean!  Tad goes to his Dad to talk to him about but his Dad is too busy putting together the crib and won't even listen for this poor baby to tell him something important.  So sad!  When Tad is ""unborn"" and encounters his family, they are having trouble and Tad helps to bring out the best in them.  Then, when he ""wakes up"" and is back with his family, he apologizes to them!  They were the ones who were so mean to that poor frog and he is the bigger person.  For a Christmas movie, this one is pretty depressing.",1394409600,4,1116,4.144186046511628
2922334,5,B000ULPFI6,"Received it within a few days of ordering it without and issues. It seems as if will be both educational and entertaining, but I'm going to wait to watch it until it's closer to Christmas.",1380672000,,188,4.4
2922335,2,B000ULPFI6,"My nearly 4 year old got very, very upset over this movie. If you have a 3 or 4-ish year old, definitely sit down and watch this with them. Around 3 years old is when fears about being left, losing family, nightmares about not being able to find mom, etc., start to surface as realistic fears. If this is the developmental stage your child is currently experiencing, and/or there's a new baby in the family (or expected), be aware.

I didn't review the storyline before putting the movie on, and let my nearly 4 year old watch it while I was cleaning. Next thing I know my daughter is in tears - no movie has ever done that to her before. I sat with her and the scene was very sad-  Leap outside the window of his home singing about how he missed his mom, and the mom singing about missing him, but his family didn't recognize him and he was feeling rejected (It's A Wonderful Life storyline). I hoped the ending would really make the purpose of the story hit home, but it was pretty anticlimactic, lacking in excitement and fun, so any child upset by this movie wouldn't get the chance to be uplifted by the ending before it ends. As expected, my daughter was clingy and had tantrums following this movie. Just be aware that this movie could stir a lot of emotions in your child.",1380412800,9,1280,4.351464435146443
2922336,4,B000ULPFI6,"Even though this movie annoys me, my niece can't get enough of it. The moral of the movie is very impressive.",1375488000,,109,4.238095238095238
2922337,5,B000ULPFI6,There is nothing that comes close to the leapfrog series of videos.  I would highly recommend them for children under 7!,1374710400,,120,4.714285714285714

2922342,5,B000ULPFI6,I was babysitting for a week for 7 childrene Ages 1 to 11. This video kept all there eyes glued. They are a christain family and homeschooled. Cant go wrong with Leap Frog they are all the best!!!,1356048000,,196,4.184210526315789

2922344,1,B000ULPFI6,If it weren't for the fact that I love my daughter so much I would make it my life's quest to destroy this show from time and space.,1355270400,,132,3.75
2922345,3,B000ULPFI6,I am a huge fan of the Leap Frog DVD's. Sadly we couldn't even watch the whole show because the DVD was scratched and would pause and skip around. :( Guess it was really only worth $3.,1354060800,,184,4.0

2922349,3,B000ULPFI6,"Most children will enjoy this, but some get scared as my grandson did -age 3? Therefore it is a judgement call by parents.",1324857600,,122,4.3478260869565215

2922351,5,B000ULPFI6,"I love Leapfrog products and this one doesn't disappoint. It's a short little movie (48 minutes) but still forms a complete story. I bought 2 of these, one for my kids and one I gave away on my blog. I think the recipient will be just as pleased with it.",1324252800,,254,4.1

2922355,5,B000ULPFI6,"Tad has hard age appropriate feelings and self esteem issues resulting from his mom being due to have a baby on Christmas. The necessary preparations (setting the crib up, etc,) for the coming baby takes time away from Tad that his older siblings and parents would normally give to him. And of course with the baby due any time everyone in the family is constantly talking about baby this and that which makes Tad feel jealous and invisible to his family. A flying winged magical fairy bug comes to grant Tad any wish he wants and Tad wishes that he was ""no longer here"". In a ""It's a Wonderful Life"" like plot the flying fairy bug makes it where Tad has never existed in Alphaville and shows how each of his family members and family friends are affected by him never having been born. Just like the George Bailey character in ""It's a Wonderful Life"" Tad is shown how everybody's life is not as great and history is not as positive for everybody, because he was never born and Tad realizes his important role in everybody's life.

2922356,5,B000ULPFI6,"Both my one year old daughter and nine year old son love this DVD. We have most of the other Leap Frog DVDs, so a Christmas special with their favorite characters was definitely a must-have. Although it doesn't have the educational value that the other videos do (it doesn't seem to teach anything but a moral lesson -- which is just as important as learning to read, I suppose), I found it amusing that it seemed to be a Leap Frog take on It's A Wonderful Life. Fun!",1265673600,2,467,4.318181818181818
