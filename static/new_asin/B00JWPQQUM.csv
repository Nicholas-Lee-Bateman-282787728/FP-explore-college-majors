8654181,4,B00JWPQQUM,"Overall this is a great collection, but realize the title is dated. This is NOT the complete collection. Currently, there are 32 episodes of Montalbano and this contains the first 26. If you want all 32 episodes, you need to purchase 3 additional DVDs with 2 episodes each for another $60.

If you rip the episodes to with MakeMKV, the region doesn't matter. This is actually a UK disk (region 2) so the audio comes up as English even though people are speaking in Italian.",1530576000,,473,4.564705882352941
