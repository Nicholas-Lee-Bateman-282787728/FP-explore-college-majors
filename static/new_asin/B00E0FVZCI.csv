5882409,4,B00E0FVZCI,"I lived near Shepard and Dark during a period given much attention in this revelatory documentary. Johnny Dark comes off as a true spiritual seeker (he and Shepard were both involved deeply in the Gurdjieff Work for much of the time span of this film), very humble and observant of life's little redeeming moments. Their interaction during the period in which they're combing through old letters reveals Shepard as kind of a curmudgeon and a bully, apparently resentful of Johnny's participation. Those familiar with Shepard's oft-plumbed relationship with his violent alcoholic father will see how deeply embedded he is in Shepard's psyche. There are also moments of supreme sweetness here. I re-watched the film, which actually employs a frustrating yet commendable discretion regarding Shepard's relationship and break-up with actress Jessica Lange, immediately upon finishing it the first time. Anyone interested in American arts and letters, family relationships, and the 1960s' legacy will enjoy this documentary, and will profit even more if they read the recently-published book of Shepard-Dark letters. There's a nice teaser at the end: Shepard is plumbing Greek tragedies for an upcoming play called ""A Particle of Dread,"" and Johnny says that Shepard's preoccupation with the Greek notion of fate might be a way of Shepard letting himself off the hook for many of his choices and misbehavior with those around him.",1391385600,13,1425,5.366071428571429

5882411,5,B00E0FVZCI,"Following playwright-actor Sam Shepard as he and long-time bud Johnny Dark prepare a book of letters for a pile of money,
this documentary gets at the heart of one of America's greatest artistic figures without any kind of filter. Following their long
friendship from 1963 onwards--including a heartbreaking period of personal loss and domestic meltdowns--the story revolves
back to Shepard's basic obtuseness. Nothing explains his behavior, walking out on his family, and then (spoiler alert) walking out
on his friend and their project (which was eventually finished). Any insight into one of the great playwrights of our time, however,
is worth a look. I found Shepard And Dark to be an extraordinary trip into the eclipse of masculinity, which is, of course, one of
Shepard's greatest concerns. And while I was looking for any evidence of Sam Shepard's residence in Nova Scotia from 1969 to
1984--there's not a mention in the documentary--I found the film to be deeply engrossing anyways.",1387756800,11,992,5.20625

5882413,4,B00E0FVZCI,"It's a ""must view"" for serious Shepard fans.  But not so much if you're not.  I am, so this was of high interest to me.  The pacing of this doc is very uneven and at times just feels like a nice amiable, rambling homage to two buddies celebrating their lifetime friendship - until it's not.  Ultimately it deals with friendship, relationships, solitude vs the need for companionship, and, yeah, even one's purpose on this earth.  There's some success, sorrow, pain, and humor.  In other words, all the elements of lives lived deeply, if not necessarily wisely.  Johnny Dark is every bit as compelling and complicated as Shepard.",1444867200,3,628,4.813084112149533
5882414,4,B00E0FVZCI,"Hello. My name is Lonnie PINGLETON. I am very briefly seen in the documentary SHEPARD & DARK. I am the bald man with glasses, working a floor buffer at the beginning of the film. I am sincerely greatful to Treva Wurmfeld for adding a cut of me in the film. It is a wonderful and humbling thing she has done.
A little update: Johnny Dark no longer works at the deli. He is now facing, straightening up the stock on the shelves, making the store look presentable for the customer. Sad to say I am glad he no longer works in the deli, as he had a bad habit of trying to ruin the floors, while we were trying to clean them. I hope this new job works better for him.
Still, I am not joking. I am forever greatful to Treva Wurmfeld for giving an average guy a chance to see himself on the big screen, if only for a few seconds.",1432944000,4,821,4.042944785276074

5882416,5,B00E0FVZCI,"I was completely taken unawares by how compelling this documentary turned out to be.  First, it is a glimpse into that oft-hidden realm, the male psyche.  Second, it is a stirring call to intellectual introspection, a long-lost art if you ask me.  And third, it speaks to the need to review and examine great literature.

Shepard and Dark are both self-educated in a way that makes me wish more minds were capable of and/or motivated to be.  They read the classics--really read the classics--mining for truths that resonate to the basic human character traits that never change throughout the ages.  As young men, a chance encounter caused them to forge a lifelong friendship.  On some level, they must have recognized companion souls, although Dark explains it as a ""meshing"" of character traits that proved complementary.  They are different, but simpatico.  Dark comes off as the more likable, and I wondered if his kindly character afforded an emotionally stunted Shepard a sounding board for growing up male that Shepard was denied by his alcoholic father.  Shepard's father was a nasty bit of work, and Shepard cannot seem to recover from the experience.  By his own admission, Shepard admits to emotional isolation and rootlessness, despite two marriages and children.  The film never touches on Shepard's mother or her role in his upbringing.

Shepard, normally a very private man, comes off as tortured, lost, doomed to make the same mistakes in life, incapable of sustaining loving relationships, and a curmudgeonly loner.  He openly discusses the dilemma involved in being a loner, namely, wanting to interact with people, yet incapable of enduring their company for long. However, when Dark's wife, Scarlett, sustained a brain hemorrhage, Shepard was untiring in his efforts to rehabilitate her, spending hours walking her around.

This is a very thought-provoking film, less for the prurient peek into the life of a reclusive movie star/playwright, and more for a keen psychological portrait of two complex yet fascinating men and the strange glue of their friendship.  I've ordered the book of their correspondence.",1420156800,3,2129,5.19941348973607

5882418,3,B00E0FVZCI,This movie was ok. The name Johnny Dark makes me wonder if there is a connection to the Johnny Darko movie (which leaves a mark on your memory). This is a documentary about Sam Shepard and Johnny Dark's long time friendship. Curiously odd film.,1414886400,,244,4.568181818181818

5882421,5,B00E0FVZCI,"In the first place, I couldn't believe the enigmatic Shepard even considered such a project, much less followed through with it - up to a point.

The majority of the story is delightful - two old friends reflecting on their quirky history together. How could anyone not envy the tie that bound them together for decades... in spite of everything.

But then...was it only in his look back that Dark realized he'd so often been treated  by Shepard as being less than equal?

And who wouldn't ache for Shepard? Did he really reach 70 before he admitted to himself that - his writing to the contrary - he has more often than not been his father's son ?

Fascinating, informative, yet disturbing and sad.

A movie that definitely deserves a second look",1401753600,3,747,4.621212121212121

8599737,2,B00E0FVZCI,"I rented this from Amazon Prime because I'm in awe of Shepard's accomplishments and talents.  I was disappointed that the film was narrated by, and primarily about Johnny Dark.  Sam seems to have lifted Johnny's status from ordinary and easily forgettable comedian to one with an artistic and literary style.  Not satisfied with the benefits Dark enjoyed from his friendship with Sam, upon learning of his friend's terminal illness due to  amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Dark proceeded to capitalize on his penchant for saving all things pertaining to Shepard.  Following Sam's death, Dark shopped his collection out as a documentary based upon correspondence.",1516924800,2,660,5.431372549019608
8599738,5,B00E0FVZCI,"Very well made and illuminating documentary.  I started reading the book Two Prospectors and there were gaps that didn't make sense to me that the documentary was able to fill in.  What jumped out at me from seeing the documentary was what well-lived and full lives each man lived on their own terms.  I got fascinated with the book because I lived in the same neighborhood as both Sam and John when they were a family.  I actually saw Sam at a local bar once sitting alone.  He looked at me and it was an odd moment because I didn't know whether to say anything.  He was pretty famous by then and I didn't want to come across as a goofy groupie...so I just left.  Another reviewer wondered if they ever reconnected prior to Sam's death this year and I am curious also.  I'm pretty sure that John maintains Sam's website, so there might be clues there!",1511049600,2,852,4.382165605095541
8599739,5,B00E0FVZCI,"This documentary moved me deeply; the winding path it takes came as a complete surprise, and yet it revealed who we had been watching all along: Sam was always Sam, and John was always John. I have always loved and respected Shepard, but I fell in love with Dark in this movie: he is the one who's blessed with all the heart, patience, compassion, commitment and utter unconcern with wealth and bourgeois comfort.

Sam, we see, is regularly haunted by the ghosts of the past; he is a control freak, he is insecure, he's anxious. And he makes no qualms about it: his description of his experience of separateness, aloneness, and the drive to create in solitude moved me to tears. He has a ton of bravery in his own, alcohol-soaked way.

I would love to read the letters: Sam may not want to revisit them, and I can respect that; but I sure do want to!! What a couple of guys!!!",1510358400,5,876,4.401234567901234
8599740,5,B00E0FVZCI,"Admirers of Sam Shepard will enjoy this intimate look at this unlikely yet enduring friendship. They're well-matched intellectually and play off each other in amusing ways. It also reveals the challenges of a friendship between a star and a ""nobody.""",1509494400,,250,5.275

8599742,4,B00E0FVZCI,"I am currently reading the book of letters, that this movie has as the center piece, ""Two Prospectors"" and was happily surprised to learn of this movie. I highly recommend both. The movie is good, but there are large blanks to fill in as to when things started to crumble (these two are tight lipped about it. Maybe we see just enough?)

To my knowledge, Johnny Dark has not commented after Sam's death and it makes me wonder about the state
of their friendship in recent years. How great though that these letters were preserved and that this movie was made as another round of story telling.",1504915200,2,593,4.542056074766355
8599743,5,B00E0FVZCI,"I am a big fan of Sam Shepard through his work as an actor and a playwright.  Other than his long term relationship with Jessica Lange, I knew nothing of his personal life.  So I found this film to be enormously interesting.  The basis for the film is the long term friendship of Shepard and Johnny Dark.  We see them in the early days in Greenwich Village.  Soon Shepard moves in with Dark and Dark's wife.  This is the period that I found most fascinating.  Shepard marries a young girl whom I believe was Dark's wife's sister.  (I may be wrong; she may have been a close friend.).  They have a child and the group lives together in a communal situation.  Dark's wife then develops a debilitating disease (MS?  It's been a while since I've seen the film so I'm vague on details.)  The group takes turns being with her, night and day.  Sam takes his turn with the rest, although he has begun to enjoy some success with his work.  Sam continues to prosper and takes over the complete financial responsibility for the group.  This situation continues for a few years as I recall.  Sam buys them a bigger home, still financing the whole family.  Then he meets Jessica Lange, falls madly in love and has the terrible dilemma of leaving the family or leaving her.  He chooses Lange, leaivng his son to remain with the family and be raised by Darke.

Although the details of the story sound horrible, what emerges in the film is the great humanity of all concerned.  Shepard's life was indeed messy but he managed to emerge with some sense of honor and decency.  How Darke ends up in a dumpy little town in New Mexico working in a deli is something we don't really understand.  He has become the one who has chronicalled Shepard's success.  We see files of scrapbooks and photos, in his humble little house.

The two embark of a project, to make the film about their friendship and this puts the two at odds, eventually even destroying the relationship.  Yet Shepard goes out of his way to push the project through in order to bring some needed finances to Darke.

These glimpses into Shepard's personal life illumine the man hugely, in my opinion.  As lovely as he is on screen, he seems even more so in person.",1501459200,6,2207,4.493702770780857
8599744,5,B00E0FVZCI,"If you are fascinated by Shepard, this film gives phenomenal insights into the humor and demons contained in his work. Even without that familiarity, it's still a remarkable portrait of the close friendship between two very male guys of that generation, with all the joy, sadness, contradiction and complexity that that contains.",1476576000,2,329,5.346153846153846
