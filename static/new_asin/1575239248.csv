8623382,5,1575239248,"i have been a fan of Agnes Nixon since I was twelve years old and I have truly loved her work on daytime drama for many years.  I bought this product because I simply wanted to know more about the woman who has entertained me with her story lines and characters since 1966.  It reveals her humble beginnings as a child, getting her start in daytime as a pupil for the legendary Irna Phillips, right up to the premiere of 'ALL MY CHILDREN'.The DVD is a MUST for any Agnes Nixon fan.  God Bless you, Agnes! Thank you for all the many hours of enjoyment you have given me with your great stories and wonderful shows! I miss you terribly. Daytime just isn't the same without you!",1398470400,,675,4.299212598425197
