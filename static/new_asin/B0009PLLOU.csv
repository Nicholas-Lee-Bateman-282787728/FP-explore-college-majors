The problem with the product descriptions on Amazon.com is that they do not give you a list of the episodes that appear on thes DVD sets.

8064836,5,B0009PLLOU,"Western TV is a collection of 28 episodes from 6 different Western TV shows from the days when Hollywood knew how to make great Westerns on both the big and small screens. I paid $7.98 for my set and considering that you can pay $5 and higher for just 4 episodes of one of these shows, you cannot complain about the price. The reason why you can get so many episodes for such a low price is that all of these shows are in the public domain. The quality of the prints used in this collection vary, but overall you will get a fairly decent picture on your screen.

A very good deal for the money.",1215216000,,594,4.120689655172414
8064837,3,B0009PLLOU,"I was most interested in the Shotgun Slade and the Judge Roy Hill episodes.  I had always heard about Shotgun Slade and so I was interested in seeing those episodes.  I enjoyed them and would be willing to see more.  However, they were a little more ""light weight"" than several people had led me to believe.  Still, I'm curious to see more.
Judge Roy Hill was interesting, but a little too comedic for my taste.  I've seen all of him that I need.
I also don't ever need to see another Buffalo Bill Jr episode.
The Lone Ranger is something that I've always liked.  However, if you don't know the opening story, you'd better find it somewhere else.  They give you most of it on this set ... and then don't finish the story!
All in all, the set is at least worth the price.",1199145600,,770,4.268965517241379
8064838,4,B0009PLLOU,"SHOTGUN SLADE is probably the only western to ever have a modern jazz soundtrack. Slade's custom made double-barreled shotgun fired both a shotgun shell and a rifle bullet.

BUFFALO BILL JR. was a Gene Autry Flying A Production. An orphan adopted by Judge Wiley (founder of Wileyville, Texas), Bill eventually became the town's marshal.

The eccentric JUDGE ROY BEAN was 41 when he married a 15-year-old girl. Bean held court in a saloon he owned in a west Texas desert town. Series star Edgar Buchanan actually bears some resemblance to the judge.

THE RANGE RIDER roamed the west on his horse Rawhide, doing good deeds. Also in this Flying A Production was the future star of BUFFALO BILL JR., Dickie Jones. (Range Rider Jock Mahoney was Sally Field's step-father.)

The WAGON TRAIN and LONE RANGER episodes in this box set are some of the more common  public domain examples of western TV programs. Through many years of travelling, the Wagon Train kept rolling. Lone Ranger's story is most familiar of all, yet it's a great concept. An ambushed and near-death Texas Ranger is rescued by an Indian. He heals and goes on a quest to rid the west of bad guys, his new friend by his side.

8064839,4,B0009PLLOU,"Here's yet another inexpensive collection of Western television series episodes that have fallen into the public domain.  The number of shows represented, six, is a bit smaller than some of the other collections available, but there is a greater number of episodes offered for each of the series, with ""Wagon Train"" represented by three hour-long episodes and ""Buffalo Bill Jr."" represented by seven episodes, and the other series having four or five episodes each.  The episodes from ""Wagon Train"" and ""The Lone Ranger"" have been released many times over on other Western collections and individual DVDs, but shows like ""Buffalo Bill Jr.,"" ""Judge Roy Bean"" (in color), and ""The Range Rider"" are not often seen on DVD.  The sixth show included in this collection, ""Shotgun Slade,"" seems almost out of place as it really is a hybrid Detective/Western series.  However, there are five episodes of ""Shotgun Slade"" included here and only Platinum Disc Corporation's 15-episode, 2-DVD collection (which Amazon also carries) represents a larger collection of commercially available ""Slade"" episodes on DVD.

As is typical with public domain material, the audio/visual quality of the episodes is not up to the standards of modern day releases, so my advice to the ""high definition"" crowd is to avoid this set.  However, for collectors/fans of vintage television shows and Westerns, all of the episodes are watchable . . . just be aware that you may already own some of these episodes if you have previously purchased Western television DVD compilations from Brentwood, Diamond Entertainment, Goodtimes, Madacy, and Platinum Disc Corporation; the audio/visual quality of this release from St. Clair Vision is comparable to those other sets.  St. Clair Vision ""ups the ante"" a bit for budget DVD releasing companies by including some bonus material, chief among them being the inclusion of an audio ""Lone Ranger"" radio episode from 1955.  Fans of television Westerns may also be intertested to know that St. Clair Vision has released 36 (of 39) episodes of the mid-1950s Western series ""Stories of the Century"" on a separate collection that Amazon also carries.",1121040000,13,2152,5.253644314868804
