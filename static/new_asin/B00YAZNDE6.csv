7209493,1,B00YAZNDE6,"I was expecting the chicks to actually turn the tables on the dude, as was stated in one reviewers statement.  However this movie is actually a soft porn for dudes, plenty of girl nudity, and licking the lips,all the while they're bitching about men being perves, blah blah, etc etc.  No male nudity at all, such a disappointment.  And in the end, who is left standing?  The guy, of course.  Pretty boring for me, and really low budget as stated by others.",1445558400,3,456,4.512195121951219
7209494,4,B00YAZNDE6,"Surprisingly good for what was obviously a threadbare budget.  The story is a clever inverting of I Spit on Your Grave, with malicious young women using the internet to trap and torment a man rendered childlike by the drugs that are also repressing his violent nature.  The tormenting is actually quite funny to a point as Jerry will do absolutely anything they ask for a peek at their naked bodies.  The teasing, however, soon becomes incredibly cruel leading to two of the pack tying a chord around his neck and leaving him for dead, his whole ordeal being streamed on the web. It becomes clear that he survived and a year later, and off his meds, he returns to  exact revenge, killing them one by one, he now live streaming their plight.  The acting was very good and natural, not the usual bimbo fare delivered for low-budget efforts in this genre.  Absent are the formulaic trappings that make Hollywood horror so wooden, this film is alive and feels it.  It speaks to the cruelty that can be dished out on social media in a fresh way and despite an escalating body count there is humor sprinkled throughout, indicating an intelligent director.  Well worth the money.",1445040000,14,1172,4.682926829268292
7209495,5,B00YAZNDE6,"This movie is the UPS of 2015 horror films it delivers the goods. Great horror, suspense, originality, tons of hot nudeness, humorous moments, good script and great pacing. From beginning to end this creative 2015 gem is phe fricking nomenal! Exploitation at its finest!

A 21st century gender bender unlike any I've ever seen. These disturbed, depraved and bored wanna be Paris Hilton, Kim Kardashian mean girls, decide to go all Paul Walker Joy Ride on a lonely wacko named Jerry. The ""empowered"" females turn the tables and decide to creep on the creeper. Watch the chicks degrade, humiliate, belittle and emasculate poor little old 6'4 350 lb. Jerry Tobin. All for cheap thrills and because they can. Just to show other obsessed horned up men woman can play that stalker, weirdo, power trip game too. Unfortunately for the females in this film men still play it better.

Jerry and this movie have more tricks up their sleeve than a sociopathic transgender Las Vegas magician. Duck tape does things I never knew it did. And I gained respect for these psycho chicks who don't want to run, they want to stay and play. Fight for fun and to the death. Last man or woman standing wins. These chicks are viscous and I LOVE them. Oh no im just as twisted as everyone else. Creeper is so entertaining and how Jerry recovers from that purple faced choke out I'll never know but I thank the movie Gods he did.

Enjoy this heart pounding in your face jazzy drum score and good performances by the whole cast. So many nice touches in this North Carolina sleezetacular. I'm a movieholic and I'm late for my meeting. I gotta go microwave me some Monica's Chili and watch this movie again.

Usually with films like this, I'm not really watching, but this film kept my attention. Mostly horror, but some of it was comedy.

7209552,1,B00YAZNDE6,"Do not believe any of the positive reviews for this movie as it is just a horrible piece of garbage on every front.

Basic plot, SPOILERS are coming, a lonely loser-type uses the internet to meet women. These women want him to do disturbing things and he does them to please them and get a ""reward"". Some of the women take it too far and end up ""killing"" the guy. Some time later, he returns to exact his revenge on these same women and posts the feeds on the internet.

The premise didn't sound too bad. The execution was horrible. The loser was played by a man more suitable to star in a wrestling event, plus he wore a horrible horrible wig. The women, all nasty individuals, torment him for their pleasure. He agrees because his reward was to see the women, partially naked or fully naked. He was supposed to get ""rewards"" for each vile act they made him do, but we only get to see 1 or 2 rewards. Two of the horrible women decide to kick it up a notch and plan to meet the loser, only to beat him and eventually try to kill them. These women, while vile nasty individuals, collectively didn't weigh half this guy's weight. Plus their ""beat down"" consisted of punches, slaps, kicks, and honestly, this guy could have just blocked their attacks, and killed them each with one punch. This fight was so unrealistic.

I guess one year later, the man has returned, minus the wig, and has captured all the tormenting women and has turned the tables. He does some sort of punishment to each woman that he was subjected to by them a year earlier. He is also streaming these torture videos. With a shaved head, the loser now looks more menacing but all of a sudden he is a no non-sense military type, also very unrealistic. But then again, why would women, in their 20's, be using a website to meet guys, just to torment them. Even Paris Hilton wouldn't do this.

The kills in this movie are ridiculous, the acting ridiculous and overall, this movie is ridiculous. If you want to see some average looking women tormenting a professional wrestler, then this is your movie. I was surprised that crud like this actually had some extras on this dvd. That too is ridiculous.",1452470400,2,2164,4.457070707070707
7209553,4,B00YAZNDE6,"This is an 80's style slasher with everything that made them so watchable. Four girls tease Jerry Tobin (Jerry Tobin) and have him perform humiliating tasks to see them nude. Jerry is mute and an Iraqi war vet on meds. They sneak up on him and abuse him and leave him for dead...although he is not dead. A year later the four girls are his nude captives.

The acting in this film is simply horrible. The plot is...well not much of a plot. The sound track was irritating as they kept using ""Psycho"" stabbing sound for every move. The girls in this film were obscene and their torment reminded me of ""Knock Knock"" the rip off of ""Death Game."" And what was with the plastic pink hand cuffs? They almost got away once, except who knows how to use a clutch anymore?

7209554,4,B00YAZNDE6,fun to watch not boring. cheap but ok lot's of eye candy. I would really give it two and 3/4 stars but I had to even out the haters.  It is a film not video which is a plus or at least it looks like one.,1451433600,,203,3.4130434782608696
7209555,3,B00YAZNDE6,"Creeper follows some extremely hot and sick women as they torment a guy who is about three fries short of a Happy Meal over an internet site, forcing him to do what they want him to do. We watch for a good chunk of the movie as this man is made to make a fool of himself and he does so just so he can get to see these girls naked in return. I guess we cant blame the character THAT much, but as things tend to do, it goes way too far and before we know it, our loveable wacko from the internet is now tossing these fine women naked into the woods before he tries to kill them, all the while broadcasting the results live on the internet. The movie kind of toys with us a bit, because our Creeper is just reacting to what happened to him. But it gets hard to not get behind hot naked women on-screen, even if they are a-holes to the highest power. So, don't be surprised if you don't find yourself wanting the big guy to still get done-in, even after youve seen what has happened to him leading to this point of the movie.

The movie is presented to us by way of filters to make it seem like a Grindhouse movie. This can really add to some movies, but this one doesnt seem to fit that method at all and I sort of wish they hadnt of went with that. We get some blood here and there, wer also get some CGI. I would harp on some of the effects more, but this is a movie that knows what its bread and butter is and it isn't the blood, its the nudity. We get plenty of that and Im sure everyone will be watching and keep watching mostly because of just that. The ladies are evil by all logic, but being a guy who digs women, I just couldn't hate them. That might make me a bad person, I dunno, but I couldnt. I will say that Darryl Baldwin is certainly a hulking individual that looks pretty darn scary. Even when we see him eating cans of chili and doing his business on a portable toilet of sorts. It isn't a movie that is made to be taken seriously, but at least it isn't boring. That goes a long way.",1449705600,5,1998,3.9825436408977555

7209599,4,B00YAZNDE6,"This movie creates a new victim / attacker scenario by using a satire of today's young women. Since it's a satire, it's exaggerated but still rings true. The narcissistic girls are quick to identity an unattractive, lower-class, older man as a ""creeper,"" and justify their treatment of him by saying he is not really human. Guys like him, they say, are just there to feed and clothe us. This refers directly to the working class, as opposed to the consumer-oriented youth that feels the world revolves around her. They plan to kill him for fun, explicitly saying that, being young women, they will be seen in the victim role: ""When is the last time you saw a beautiful woman go to jail?"" The daring scenario rings true, although conventional viewers would find it disturbing or ""misogynist,"" because it defies the idea that women cannot be villains. But the freedom to be potentially evil might just be a form of liberation - from idealizations.

The revenge story is a reversal of classic rape-revenge b-movies. It's crudely filmed with some continuity problems, but it works. Neither the man, who appears to be a veteran, or the girls, who remain unrepentant to the end, are likable. So, this is a rarity - a morally ambiguous erotic-horror-thriller. The suspense of the second half of the film is handled well, and ""Jerry"" turns out to be not unlike Jason - a super-strong and all-but-indestructible foe. Jason punished promiscuous teens, so the girls' punishment has a familiar ring.

Any semblance of acting in this movie was not only non-existent, but relegated to those of us that could feign interest long enough to provide a review.  As a previous reviewer stated, this move was a poor excuse for misogyny and while some people may tune in for that very reason, my advice would be to turn away quickly.  Any and all characters are far too inane and annoying. Moreover, the only apparent eye candy in this flick was when the credits rolled.",1445817600,,564,4.456310679611651

7209623,1,B00YAZNDE6,"If I could give it less than one star, I would. This is simply an awful, awful film. It looks like somebody shot it in their backyard and just wanted an excuse to get girls naked. The special effects are laughably bad, the story is disjointed, the whole thing is a mess. Do not waste your time.",1445731200,,294,4.175438596491228
7209624,4,B00YAZNDE6,"I liked it. It is a cheap budget horror film which borders on soft-core porno. What does interest me in these films is where they take us psychologically. In this one there really are no angels (well the one girl who early on whom was a little bit unsure of what they were doing maybe is a bit of an angel.). While no saint, very pervy what he was doing, it was still wrong of them to tease him. Like I said, no angels here. I would love to hear a ""making of"" featurette and know exactly how the actresses were able to put themselves in that headspace, especially where they spent oh half the film stark naked (don't get me wrong, they are all very healthy looking). My favorite scene was the cage in the swamp, that was something I would never have thought of. So for the cast, I give it a 4 star. Very simple in its delivery, a bit cheesy in spots and somewhat unbelieveable. But I loved the grittiness. The cast delivered.",1445731200,3,925,4.231638418079096

8717945,3,B00YAZNDE6,Not the cheapest or worst acted movie I've ever seen but right up there but The copious amount of nudity in this movie more than makes up for the imperfections and it kept me on the end of my seat waiting for the next shot of full frontal.if your a guy like me  that's more likely to buy a movie because of the nude women do yourself a favor and check this one out.(btw it's free to watch on amazon prime),1499644800,,405,4.0
8717946,2,B00YAZNDE6,"A run of the mill B-movie just with the worst fight scenes/ special effects ever. The girls are attractive but not smoking hot and while there is gratuitous nudity sprinkled throughout, the movie itself isn't good enough to make me admit to anyone that I actually watched it on purpose. It's not absolutely shameful, but close to it.",1492905600,,333,4.758620689655173
8717947,1,B00YAZNDE6,"This movie is so bad...just so bad. I get that it's an homage to grindhouse flicks, but dude, NO! I have seen my fair share of bad movies and thus is just God awful. I really don't know why I finished the movie.

So this dude is online looking for friends and this chickshould ""befriends"" him and humiliates him. He takes revenge kind of like ""I Spit on Your Grave."" Dude has no lines mimicing Mike Myers and Jason trying to be scary & creepy but falls flat. Mean girls trying to be mean girls but horrible at it.

Concept: OK
Characters: Card stock
Acting: Average
Pace: Moderate

8717948,1,B00YAZNDE6,"I have watched a ton of B Horror flicks. I only have four movies on my ""These both suck and blow"" list. Now I have five. Anyone rating this more than one star HAS to be related to the film. Has to be. If you can make it through the first hour of idiot girls fake giggling, you will be rewarded with full frontal nudity for the rest of the movie, if you like that kind of thing. I do not.
