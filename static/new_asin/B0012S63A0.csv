The fact is that it is mostly a promotional film as it shows students of this particular artist holding up their work which is the same picture painted ovr and over again.",1308960000,,326,4.327868852459017
8247668,5,B0012S63A0,"I have tried a few other instructional painting videos and this far surpassed my previous experiences.  She does a great job of both explaining and showing.  It is also nice there are students in the video.  So, she has them try certain techniques and corrects their form.  I highly recommend this video if you are just getting started with acrylic painting.",1264896000,2,358,4.819672131147541
8247669,5,B0012S63A0,"I do a watch a lot of how to creative video's. What I want out of them is clear, concise information. Gingers video teaches what is says it teaches. While its true production quality is not high I finished this video with the painting it promised. This is a how to dvd not a movie. By the way I spent thousands on an art education and still had to teach myself how to stretch a canvas. Ginger explains this important studio skill perfectly. I wish one professor had taken the time to do so. That alone is worth the 30 dollars for the video as you will save 100's on canvass. I had no trouble with the sound at all. All in all I was personally happy.",1254960000,3,649,4.118110236220472
8247670,5,B0012S63A0,"This is exactly what I have been looking for. I wanted a video that was like being in an art class. This is it! Ginger Cook provides useful information on how to prep a canvas, mix colors and which brushes to use to achieve various affects. If you are looking for a video that is a self-paced class that at the end you will have a beautiful picture and feel like you could apply what you learned in future paintings, this is the video for you. I do recommend that you set up like you are in the class and pause or rewind as needed. You will be very pleased with the outcome if you take the time to apply what Ginger Cook teaches you. As an accomplished
artist, she is sharing her talent with you.",1253145600,8,696,4.125
8247671,5,B0012S63A0,"I'm so pleased with this video!!! I found the negative reviews listed here, were not accurate to my experience at all.

Ginger is an excellent instructor & obviously loves what she does. I researched Ginger & found that her art is EXTRAORDINARY!!! I aspire to have talent such as hers someday.
With Acrylic Secrets,I was able to paint the picture just like everyone else in the video. With the tips, tricks & instruction in this video, I was able to take a class right in my home. Since I am a stay at home mama, I rarely get out to take such a class. The local painting classes are much more expensive than this video! I would not have been able to ""replay"" a class either.

I have purchased other videos for such as Tim Holt, Tracy Bautista & others. I am pleased with my new adventures of at home instruction & would encourage anyone of any age to purchase this video if they are interested in painting. I think this video would be great for a classroom in public schools as well.
Thank you Ginger for a great class!!!",1252713600,7,1021,4.368421052631579
8247672,1,B0012S63A0,"I buy this for my mother for chrsitmas because she has recently  started to become interested in painting.  We put this into our relatively new theater system and attempt to watch video.  this look like someone has taken cheap camcorder put on tripod and with this terrible sound quality created a movie.  You can barely see what she is painting and can barely hear what she is saying  unless you turn the sound way way up.  At which point the scene transitions are SO LOUD that it shake the window.  I rteturn this DVD and I am not happy with this at all.  My mother did not even want to watch this because it was neraly impossible to listen to and bad to see. Between straining to hear and plugging ears fromt he terrible transitions to the poor quality of the video, i would rate this a 1 out of 10.  I feel bad for this but it was not worth $5, not to mention $30.  Sorry :(",1232150400,5,878,4.1726190476190474
8247673,5,B0012S63A0,"Being 70 and taking up a new hobby I was looking for the fastest way to get results that my family and friends could say that I have some talent.  After using Ginger Cooks method I have just those results.  My art may never hang in the louve but my friends and family think I'm a budding Rembrtandt.
  Ginger's DVD's were quite helpful in advanceing my satisfaction with getting results quickly.

8247674,5,B0012S63A0,"I really loved this two disk DVD.
This instructional DVD shows in one painting many different things. I liked the sequence on how do wet on wet techniques for water by applying two layers of wet paint that allows for easy blending. I was especially impressed with the 4 novice students who seemed to be able to master this on the first try. I think $30 is a deal when most of the other painting DVDs I have seen that are over 3 hours with 2 disks are usually twice that. And if you want to understand how to mix colors effectively, this is great. There must be 10 different shades of green in the DVD, all of which are mixed without buying a green tube of paint. For me I had a blast applying the step by step lesson and learned allot.
The bonus feature on stretching canvass was very helpful too.",1212192000,9,797,4.215686274509804
8247675,3,B0012S63A0,"She explained and demonstrated the techniques well, but the lighting made it very difficult to see the different shades of color.",1211328000,,129,5.190476190476191
8247676,1,B0012S63A0,"I wasn't very impressed by this DVD.  To be honest, I think I learned more by watching Tim Gagnon's time lapse video painting sessions on YouTube--and I didn't have to pay a penny for that.  Granted, Ginger Cook does provide useful information on how to prep a canvas, mix colors and which brushes to use to achieve various affects, but the entire two hour-plus lesson covers just a single painting.  For thirty bucks I was expecting more.  For instance, if want to learn about how to paint a mountain scene, or a seashore or a structure of some sort, this DVD is of little help.  My advice: save yourself thirty bucks and check out YouTube instead.",1207612800,16,649,4.560344827586207
