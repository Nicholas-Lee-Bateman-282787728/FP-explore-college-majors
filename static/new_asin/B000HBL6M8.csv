8137960,5,B000HBL6M8,"This is a great interview wit Paul McCartney. I missed the PBS broadcast of the interview; and I couldn't find it at the local library. So when I saw it on amazon.com, I wanted to buy it. I played the DVD and enjoyed the interview. I also enjoy everything Charlie Rose does.",1426118400,,274,4.288461538461538

8137962,5,B000HBL6M8,"While the older 'Charlie Rose' installments are a few dollars more, this one might be worth it. Jan Harlan and Christiane Kubrick highlight this tribute to one of the greatest, (and unique) movie directors of all time. The focus revolves around the DVD documentary, and its development. I would love to see all those interviews that didn't make that cut! Intersting discussion, along with Martin Scorsese (who seems to weigh in on many documentaries about film history) is a brief history of Kubricks personal life from his wife, Christiane.",1377561600,,541,5.089887640449438
8137963,4,B000HBL6M8,"I know very little about business and certainly very very little about big business like 'Amazon'. Jeff Bezos its founder here talks about the company, its present position and plans, that is of late June 2001. 'Amazon' during this time was apparently going through a time of drop in its market shares after the highs they hit in 1999. Bezos talks about Amazon being a 'customer centered company'. He talks about the expansion from books, music, video into other areas such as electronics. It is the ' superstore' of the world, in Charlie Rose's phrase. Bezos explains how Amazon forms partnerships with other companies. He says the 'Wall Street Journal' has in a survey- article rated 'Amazon' the company with highest customer satisfaction.
Bezos appears as an extremely smart operator, a person who really knows what he is doing, a good businessman. I suspect that those who take interest in business will enjoy this interview.
I write a lot of reviews on 'Amazon'. And sometimes I wonder if it makes much sense to 'work for nothing' in this way. I do not know the answer. And certainly the model and goal presented here by Bezos does not inspire to continue this for some noble goal. On the other hand I don't see anything wrong with the doing business for business - sake. On the whole my sense is that 'Amazon' and companies like it , say 'Barnes and Noble' and the whole Web- commerce business have in the world I know something about the world of books, truly been of great service and help to most interested readers. I still find it quite 'amazing' that I can find almost any book I want through the service of 'Amazon'. And I appreciate having the opportunity to write about books , ideas, people, that I have some experience of - with the hope of communicating this writing to others.",1195344000,,1796,4.668769716088328
8137964,5,B000HBL6M8,"Milken tells the story of his own struggle with prostate cancer. At the age of forty-six without symptoms in a regular check up he had a Prostate Specific Antigen(PSA) of twenty- four, a much higher number than normal. A repeat check turned out to prove that it was no mistake. After this Milken began the fight for his life. He radically changed his diet, learned everything he could about the illness, spoke with and was treated by a number of doctors. He does not mention this, but financial means enable one to better fight an illness like this than one would otherwise.
Milken also drastically changed his life- style which had involved rising to work at three in the morning and going to sleep at eleven at night. He  made a major effort to reduce stress in his life.
The illness and the fact that five members died in a short time of cancer made him devote most of his energies in the years ahead to aiding in the struggle against Cancer. He contributed and raised money for cancer - research and as the program on Charlie Rose attests spoke persuasively about the importance of public education about Cancer. He also has urged for increased Federal budgets for Cancer care.
Milken is insistent almost obsessive in his quest. Rose does not really ask him about the financial scandal, the jail term, the moral question involved but rather presents him as innovative financial person who revolutionized the investment situation in America. In any case Rose is right to make that secondary here as Milken has an important message and mission, and his carrying out so assiduously is greatly to his credit.
P.S. The major innovation of Milken was in changing the way projects for research of Cancer is funded. He seeing the slowness of the traditional process, enabled and provided seed money for a far wider range of proposals. He accelerated the whole research process. The idea which he initiated in Prostate Cancer research has so far as I understand it taken off in other areas. I owe this information to Dr. Lewis Rosen.",1195257600,,2028,4.745042492917847
8137965,4,B000HBL6M8,"Paul McCartney a living legend is interviewed by Charlie Rose. The studio audience is overwhelmingly 'for' McCartney. They love the 'Beatles' and they love Paul McCartney. McCartney appears in order to publicize his first book of poems, ""Blackbird Singing."" He reads a number of the poems. However before reading them he tells what they are about. And the poems sound as if they are the literal repetition of what he has said. The poems are unfortunately not much as poetry.
Paul has since the 'Beatles' have gone, formed his own groups, done many recordings, written a symphony, painted , and now published a book of poetry. But the lisence to do this comes because of the world's love for the 'Beatles'music.
McCartney appears as a very pleasant fellow, with a good sense of humor, and with twinkle and irony towards himself also. It is difficult to know however whether he understands the truth, the truth which need not be bitter.i.e. What the world truly wants is 'the Beatles' and not what McCartney has done after them.
Rose is smart, and therefore has McCartney talk about his present doings, his poems before getting into what everyone is still curious about, the story of 'the Beatles'. One poem which should have been more moving than it was is about the relationship between Paul and John. Paul tells a few Beatles' stories including one about a hurricane postponing a gig , and them spending the night off , drinking and crying together. Paul says how he is glad that he and John made up before John's death.
Rose somewhere mentions the song 'Yesterday' which he claims is the most recorded of all times. Paul says he prefers, ""Here, There and Everywhere"" which involves more 'craft'. He speaks about how he enjoys the craft of songwriting, of how he considers himself primarily a songwriter, how songwriting comes relatively easy to him. He also when asked by Rose what he wishes to do with the rest of his life says 'Enjoy'
A pleasant hour, but one without the playing of any of the Beatles songs which are so loved by so many of us.",1194307200,5,2048,4.7075208913649025
8137966,2,B000HBL6M8,"I teach a freshmen information systems class and viewed the video for about 100 students, they were bored to tears...the questions in the interview were very common questions with predictable answers.",1173312000,,200,5.483870967741935
8137967,3,B000HBL6M8,"Public Television staple Charlie Rose presents his usual eclectic mix of interviews with leading personages from science, technology, literature, and the arts. Whether these interviews were originally intended to be together on the same program, or not, I do not know.

Not being a paleontologist, I can only comment generically on the first segment which I found interesting more for the details of discovery than the discovery itself.  Youth and perseverence, and some basic good luck seems to have mattered as much as training and experience. And both guests are articulate enough to explain the significance of their discovery and their techniques with enthusiasm.

My interest was in the second segment, with ABT principal dancer Angel Corella.  Viewing it, however, made it interesting for an entirely different reason: watching Charlie Rose's hit-&-miss interviewing technique. Mr. Corella managed to smile with equanimity as Mr. Rose mangled his name not once, but several times; and Mr. Rose's research was missing some basic chunks of info that would have prepared him better--such as viewing the PBS doc ""Born to Be Wild: The Men of ABT"" (c. 1998) which includes a bio of Mr. Corella.  Mr. Rose also seemed to forget he had already asked the same question only minutes before.  Through it all, Mr. Corella remained the polite, honest, emotive, articulate person he is, and demonstrated some brilliant dancing in the two clips shown from his variations in the ""Corsair"" pas de trois, and ""Don Quixote"" pas de deux.

The final segment provided both some wonderful insight into Blake's life and thought process, as well as some views of his more famous drawings and paintings.  For those of us unable to attend the exhibit, it was nice to see.",1160697600,,1751,5.0979020979020975
