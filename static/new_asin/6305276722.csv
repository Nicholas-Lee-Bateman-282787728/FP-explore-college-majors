7888045,5,6305276722,This box set has been a joy to own. A lot of memories in here for me. I should point out that this set should be updated With a 20th Anniversery Box set that should be out on DVD with all the Orginal 4-6 shows not this 3 hour cut out C*** that Vince and his guys have put together on these other vhs tapes and dvds. I can say that I have been to WRESTLEMANIA 19 & 20 they were awsome,1095811200,,383,3.682926829268293
7888046,5,6305276722,"While not a big fan of the ""WWF Attitude"" box set, the bottom line is that A) It's cheaper than the original retail price of the original new releases (check out the original pre-views, hit a rental store, or look at old wrestling magazines for more info if you don't believe, but these tapes cost as much as one PPV TODAY ($39.95 for WM IV alone!). Yes, it's over $100, and almost $200, but divide that cost by 14-15 tapes, and the resulting figure is quite nice. Now, consider buying each tape individually at $10 a tape, or even $8 a tape and compare the difference. I promise it is significant. ESCPECIALLY if you are looking for the Coliseum video version, which can run anywhere from $20-80 each, depending on the seller. There are slight differences and edits in the footage on each different version of WM, but it's always nice to be able to get a collection of items all at one time, and at a discounted price. Recommended.",1075334400,3,932,4.488235294117647

I grew up on wrestlemania, so for me it's a walk down memeory lane.  From the Hulkster to Stone cold, it's all here.",1048204800,,284,4.109090909090909
