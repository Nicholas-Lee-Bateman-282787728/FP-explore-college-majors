7751910,5,B01FUYRKIU,Great performance by Kelsey Grammer as a Brit banker and some serious moral lessons learned about the financial crisis thanks to a decent script.,1468886400,,145,5.083333333333333
8761572,4,B01FUYRKIU,"Let's be clear right from the start: ""Breaking the Bank"" is not destined to go down in history as an iconic film about the greedy bankers that damn near sank the world economy a few years ago.
That said, this is a charming movie with a fine cast and smooth direction that is something of a cross between ""Trading Places"" and ""Wall Street."" It has some pointed things to say about the pirates who ran (and in many cases still do) gigantic financial institutions around the world; many of whom have no real idea what they're doing beyond the fact that they are getting fat bonuses annually. It's also an offbeat sort of romantic comedy that  offers some interesting sideline commentary about the harm major banking institutions have done (and in many cases are still doing) to individuals and the environment.
Kelsey Grammer and Tamsin Greig co-star in the movie and both, I think, do their roles proud. Grammer manages to make his bumbling banker someone that the viewer can sympathize with and even feel some affection for despite his ineptness. He spews hoary old one-liners about marriage and parenting like they are new jokes and that is oddly in keeping with his character. Grieg, who is a very fine comedic actress, brings a sort of regal disdain to her role as wife, mother, and majority shareholder of the bank her family founded 200 years ago. John Michael Higgins, as a ruthless American banker out to take over the troubled bank, is smarmy enough to fit right in with the current Wall Street crowd.
The script is fairly predictable and doesn't really ask the actors to stretch their talents very much but that's not a terrible thing in a film that's part social commentary and part romantic comedy. You won't be on the edge of your seat nor will you weep copious tears at the scenes flitting across your screen. Neither, however, will you cringe. As I said, this is a charming movie that you can sit back, relax, and enjoy without having to concentrate very hard.",1486425600,,1973,4.685878962536023

8761576,3,B01FUYRKIU,Clueless British banker manages to lose all the bank's $. Lumbering thing. Not funny. See 'The Big Short' and/or 'Too Big to Fail'. Pass on this.,1473379200,,145,4.615384615384615
8761577,1,B01FUYRKIU,"slow paced ""comedy"" of dim witted old English money, lost and regained; disappointing",1472774400,,85,5.615384615384615

8761579,4,B01FUYRKIU,"Charles (Kelsey Grammer) is the figure head of Tufton Bank, a prestigious British bank filled with tradition. He inherited the position from his father-in-law. He surrounds himself with knowledgeable people. His daughter Annabel (Sonya Cassidy) is a staunch anti-capitalist who lives with ""freegans"" people who live out of dumpsters. His wife Penelope (Tamsin Greig) is controlling. Charles remarks to his wife, ""I'm trying to forget my mistakes. No sense in two of us remembering the same thing.""

Because of a combination of the real estate bubble and bad trades, Charles causes the bank to go into the red as his wife is unforgiving and he contemplates ending it all. His ledger is ""nothing right on the left and nothing left on the right."" At this point the formula of dry humor that worked do well changes as the film enters into a combination of ""Life Stinks""  and the more familiar ""Trading Places.""

What was unfortunate was that they were able to come up with good one-liners and a cast who were great at delivery, but resorted to a silly formula ending that felt rushed and confused.

8761581,4,B01FUYRKIU,"Yes , Kelsey Grammers character was inept at banking, and the character wasn't getting that his actions were ruining lives, but you still really liked the character. When I was watching it, it reminded me of any old Cary Grant movie. Lovable character. Good movie.",1470700800,3,264,4.888888888888889
