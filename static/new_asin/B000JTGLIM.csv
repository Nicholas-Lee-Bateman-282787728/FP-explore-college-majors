2679058,2,B000JTGLIM,"***Okay, I've left my original review below, but I'd like to add this note - I LOVE pot humor, and I generally like ANYTHING funny, but this is like the worst pot movie I've ever seen, and if you're not stoned, it's not funny.  I see by all the not helpful votes that rating anything pot-related as not good earns me no friends, however, I was just reviewing the movie honestly.  I would never watch it again, even with my pot smoking friends.  I should maybe also rephrase.  I was not expecting a ""realistic"" movie.  Maybe what I meant is the acting sucked as bad as the plot.***
Original review:
This movie is really not a good movie.  It's tedious to watch.  While watching, I actually said to my fellow movie watchers, ""That entire scene could have been cut out.""  This was true more than once.  Beyond that, nothing in the movie is believeable.  There are a few sparse laughs, based on crude drug or sex humor.  Maybe if one watched with their own evil bong, this movie could be enjoyable.  Don't buy it, rent at a discount.",1163289600,2,1029,4.414893617021277

2679065,5,B000JTGLIM,What can I say huge fan of the series just saw the 3D one last week in chicago and loved it. Its one of those type of movies you watch with your buddies and just shake your head and laugh. It has that bathroom humor hs and college guys use. Great cast of people met robin and charles band last week 2 amazing people If you like goofy humor and weird stuff happening in a movie this is the right movie for you. PT 2 is really funny king bong is nuts.,1302825600,,449,3.891304347826087

2679067,4,B000JTGLIM,"After Sid's many years of watching Full Moon films we could only assume that Charles Band and his crew had to be big time tokers considering the quality of their movies. After watching Evil Bong that thought has been confirmed, launching our enjoyment of Full Moon even higher then ever before. Only a company like this could make a horror film based on smoking weed out of a possessed bong. It's right up Sid's alley.

The film focuses on some burn outs who gain a very nerdy roommate who is against smoking bud (much like a portrayal of a young Santa). They read in the classifieds of High Times that a bong with evil powers is for sale and decide they must have it. Once they start taking their hits the bong brings them into it's world, which happens to be a strip club run by midget actor/Full Moon Alumni Phil Fondacaro, where they are held captive. Eventually the only man that can save them is the bongs original owner Tommy Chong.

Evil Bong is certainly not for the movie snob looking for a legitimate horror flick. But judging by the title we could only assume you'd steer clear of it unless you wanted low budget b goodness. In addition to some hilariously bad acting we were graced with Rock of Love contestant Brandi C playing one of the strippers. Fantastic! This was before her she attempted to hunt down ""bald under his cowboy hat"" washed up rocker Bret Michaels and thought she'd make it in the film world. For Sid this one was a success and certainly would have been loved in the golden days due to it's gratuitous stripper nudity and horrid acting.",1250553600,,1568,4.4982456140350875
2679068,4,B000JTGLIM,"Tommy Chong and Evil Bongs!!!! How can you go wrong?? There's lots of fun here. You got your group of stoners (think the gang from Half Baked but more clueless) that stumble on a bong with magic powers, but not the good kind, the bad kind... the EVIL kind. Once you smoke this bong you're sent into this evil world filled with strippers that try to kill our heroes (not a bad way to go) and now they must find a way to destroy this evil bong. Tommy Chong is hilarious as the guy who has gone up against this bong before. He's got that classic stoner's charm that has made him famous. I couldn't stop laughing at all the goofy stuff these guys were doing. This is your perfect stoner flick with hilarious moments and naked chicks. I mean, this is no masterpiece but if you like some just dumb fun entertainment it's certainly worth a watch. And I just heard that a sequel's coming out in July!!!! I can't wait to check it out. I hope they make a long line of the movies in the future.",1246492800,,983,4.2063492063492065
2679069,1,B000JTGLIM,"This was a very dumb movie about a possessed bong named Eebee. Whenever she is smoked by the stupid pot-heads, they are transported to a world with hot women. That's pretty much all there is! If you have an extremely low IQ from smokin weed all freakin' day, I'm sure you'll love EVIL BONG!!!",1235865600,,292,4.425925925925926
2679070,3,B000JTGLIM,"Yeah, I know you've stared down this box while browsing at the local video store, wondering if it's really worth your time and money.  Well, thankfully I watched it for ya and I'd honestly have to say that you might wanna leave it alone.  It wasn't THAT bad(I watched the whole thing so I guess that's something), I know I've certainly seen worse.
The story deals with a group of stoners who purchase a bong from New Orleans that supposedly has a curse on it.  Well, it certainly does.  Those who use it are zonked out of consciousness and then have their souls(we can assume it's the soul) placed inside the bong.  The inside of the bong houses it's own mini universe which is a strip club.  The strip club is full of hot dancers who wear Monsterbras(a new item Full Moon sells on their website).  Also in the strip club/bong purgatory are many members of the Full Moon universe who make brief appearances.  You'll see Ivan from Decadent Evil, the Jack In The Box from Demonic Toys, The Gingerdead Man, and Jack Deth from the Trancers films.  Plus a completely pointless and unnecessary cameo from Bill Moseley.
Our stoner heroes are usually killed by one of the strippers upon entering this world, and are then doomed to spend eternity there while their real bodies die, a la Nightmare On Elm St.  The stoners' new roomate is a nerdy anti-drug metaphysics student, so naturally he is instrumental in saving the day.  Tommy Chong plays the bong's original owner and stops by in the final act to lend a hand at stopping the bong before it sets out to conquer the world.
It sounds a lot more fun than it is, as is pretty much the case with most of the newer Full Moon films.  They have amusing concepts, but cruddy execution.  Also in the same tradition is the fact that the entire film is shot in one set, in this case it's the stoners' apartment.  We never leave the apartment, only in the fleeting strip club scenes.  It actually seems more like a play than a movie.  You should also know that when you see the name and picture of a well known actor on the cover of a Full Moon DVD, be assured that actor is in the film for less than ten minutes.
Evil Bong has a few chuckles here and there, and the cameos are cool, but it's definitely not the ""High"" point in Full Moon's catalog.",1214784000,6,2283,4.4
2679071,2,B000JTGLIM,"Only thing I thought was cool about this movie was how Band mixed a few of his other horror movie characters in it. I think reviewers are focusing on Chong too much when this isn't really a Chong movie. Chong is on the cover to get some sells. It wasn't like he was in the entire movie. He came in towards the end to put an end to this disaster of a movie. This is a Charles Band movie, and like many of his movies they're only good because they're so bad. - And this comes from a Puppet Master fanatic!",1186099200,3,503,3.99009900990099
2679072,5,B000JTGLIM,"This is a funny movie, but I guess you can only appreciate the humor if you are currently smoking..... I loved the soundtrack and would buy it if I could find it, the movie lacked any real acting talent but was funny none the less. Not a movie for children unless you want to answer eight million questions. If you have a warped sense of humor and love pot then I suggest this movie.",1184371200,,383,4.1891891891891895

2679075,2,B000JTGLIM,"i sat there watching this movie wondering if anything exciting was going to happen. sat there long enough to doze off and turn off the second half of the movie because i was getting so bored i couldn't keep my eyes open. it appeared to be a college film made for art class done by stoners who didn't care if anyone was going to watch it. i didn't give it one star because it has a great soundtrack to it and i only wished they would have put in more money for editing and maybe more scenery then the apartment of the stoners. (sorry if the second half of the movie was good, but i couldn't make it that far). they spent way too much filler time in this movie and should have cut about half of it out to keep the pace quicker instead of letting it draw itself out.

so what was i expecting? not much, but i'm just a little mad i wasted my money on this. definitely a rental when you're high with your friends. i would have expected something like this to come out of the 70's, but not anytime lately.",1167004800,5,999,4.096938775510204

I thought it was very funny and even if you don't have an odd sense of humor like I do, you should  buy this movie  just to  give the rude gesture to  departed Attorney General Ashcroft and the rest of the Bushies . If anyone ever makes a believable movie about a magic bong, please let me know. SHEESH !  You can tell what to expect here from the title alone.",1163462400,20,576,4.181818181818182
