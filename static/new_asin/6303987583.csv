7858801,3,6303987583,"These serials were, after all, made to be viewed one chapter a week, and so watching one in its entirety can become tedious.  This is definitely in that category.
Now, I've given it three stars mainly because serial collectors aren't likely to regard it as one of the classic must see ones.  It is enjoyable, at least for those like me who just plain enjoy the serial genre.  But there isn't a whole lot to distinguish it.
However, as an adventure serial, separate from the crime, science fiction, super hero, or western genres, it is surprisingly good because it sweeps over a variety of geographical locales.
It begins in Cairo and involves a couple of espionage agents, a villainous sea captain, and various other characters.  Over the 15 chapters, you're taken to sea, to the Northern California Coast, to the American desert, among other places.  You have smugglers, pirate types, and just plain no-goods battling our heroes.  And then there's the black coin of the title which is supposed to bring bad luck to the holder.  It apparantly doesn't all the time though.  Actually, the black coins are Arabic coins which were made over by Christian Crusaders, and over a period of time turn black.
So this is a serial which just doesn't have the elements that serial lovers especially love, but it is a rollicking adventure story, and as I said before, is far better viewed a chapter at a time.",1023408000,8,1395,4.735537190082645
