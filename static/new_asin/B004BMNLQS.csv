8422037,5,B004BMNLQS,"This 2 disc set is truly amazing, both in the quality of information and the quantity. It runs for 490 minutes and includes instruction, applications, forms and details. Nicholas Yang takes you through the information at three speeds, slow, medium and fast. He states that all training can be done at different levels. Basic training can be practiced at very high levels. High level training can be practiced at basic levels. It is for this reason that I recommend this set for all level of martial artist. I am new at learning some xingyi and bagua, after having 15 years of Yang style tai chi training. My teacher is a former coach and instructor at Shaolin Temple and also worked with the Beijing Police. He has been teaching us some of the very things that this DVD set goes over. Kicks, punches, applications. I learned some very good nuances from watching, even though my level is low and my physical stamina is not up to doing the forms and sets as shown.

The quality of the filming is also wonderful. They use a very uncluttered studio, with a plain blue background and the camera work captures both hands and feet. This is sometimes not the case in lesser quality productions from other instructors.
The sets are shown first by Nicholas Yang and then by a few other students. A good eye can begin to pick out the  subtle differences in ability, style and technique. We have not all been brought up by Master teacher/family members, and so I like that the simple things are pointed out. For example, he tells us that the forward foot in toed in about 15 degrees in some stances so that your body weight is
focused in instead of leaning to the outside. He mentions to cock the wrist back when practicing tiger grabs so that you work deeper tendons and ligaments, instead of just using the finger joints. In the same section he also says to squeeze and condense the body while squeezing the hands. This is the sort of thing that those new to the practice can do, and is also a gem of information to
those at a higher level.

I also liked the short clip at the beginning by Master Yang. He tells a little about how the names of the forms where created and about the sections of China that they came from.

All in all, this is an Amazing collection. I recommend you buy it and then take the time to try it.",1302393600,,2311,4.443396226415095
8422038,5,B004BMNLQS,"A great DVD on the more advanced parts of Long Fist Kung Fu, terrific exercises for martial artists of any style, although you may feel a little silly doing some of them, they will work your legs and additional muscles to an extraordinary degree.  At 400 minutes in length, you get amazing amounts of information handed to you at a great price.",1300579200,,344,4.548387096774194
8422039,5,B004BMNLQS,"I was totally impressed with the quality of Mr. Yang's Long Fist DVD.  While he is still coming into his own with the formal oral presentation, there is no question he quickly hits his stride once he begins physically demonstrating and verbally describing the component forms of Long Fist - simply outstanding.  His martial skill is evident and he clearly understands the depth of the art (eg, subtle points, like intention and flow).  The instructive format of the video and the genuine heart with which Mr. Yang delivers the content yields a solid resource for the practitioner truly intent on improving their skill level. Highly recommended.",1296259200,2,644,5.056603773584905
