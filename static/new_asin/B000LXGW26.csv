8465781,5,B000LXGW26,Haven't watched it yet. But I'm sure it will be great,1454457600,,53,3.909090909090909
8465782,1,B000LXGW26,"This video is nothing but highlights of the players, most of whom were no big deal, with monotonous voices spouting platitudes. I got it free, but I still want money back, because I'll never get back the time I wasted on this. Legends? Quinn, Abiamiri, Shark, Carlson? Not by any stretch of the imagination.

My only regret (other than watching it) is that I can't give zero stars.",1292976000,,381,4.602941176470588
8465783,1,B000LXGW26,"This item is misleading.  Only 1 Heisman winner is featured (Tim Brown).  And only a few other greats, such as Montana, Bettis, and Page.  The style mimics a draft analysis.  Are you kidding me?!  And not very detailed analysis at that.  I would've returned the item but am collecting an ND DVD set.  So... I decided to keep it.  But I wouldn't recommend this item overall.",1203638400,2,373,4.545454545454546
