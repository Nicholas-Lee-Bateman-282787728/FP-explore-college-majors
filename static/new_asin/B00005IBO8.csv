8278383,1,B00005IBO8,"NOT CHRISTOPHER BRADLEY?

Someone has attached Christopher Bradley's name to this movie.  This appears to be an error, unless there are two actors of the same name (generally not allowed).  I have not seen this movie, but, if you take a look at the cover photo (a tiger) and the studio (Greatest Sports Legends), you will see that this cannot be the same as the movie ""Killer Instinct"", released by Lions Gate and starring Eddie Bowz, Christopher Bradley, etc.

Unfortunately, the Lions Gate movie was never released on DVD, and is only available used as an out-of-print VHS.  The Lions Gate release is the one that stars the same Christopher Bradley who starred in Leather Jacket Love Story.

BE CAREFUL IF YOU BUY THIS MOVIE - IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO INCLUDE THE ACTOR NAMED CHRISTOPHER BRADLEY.",1296777600,,795,4.766423357664234
