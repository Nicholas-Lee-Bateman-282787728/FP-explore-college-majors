There are also far too many slow ballads on it for my taste. The soloists are also too studied and in ""studio mode"" to be fun.  Some people may like this, but, for me, his live performance DVD ""Obrigado Gente!"" is a far better choice. On that DVD there is a wide range of energy from his great up tempo songs with full band, to great solo guitar/voice pieces. His guests are also wonderful. If you like mellow background music get ""40 Anos Depois"", but if you want inspired Bosco buy ""Obrigado Gente!""",1390262400,,679,4.223076923076923
