8509612,5,1889127272,This is a great addition to the video and music CD that Christy Lane offers... a great way to be more clear with the steps.  I became very interested in learning how to dance and Christy's products have become my main teacher now.,1242691200,,230,4.348837209302325
8509613,5,1889127272,"Christy Lane's ""Complete Guide to Line Dancing"" IS complete.  Not only recommended for teachers, but also any one wanting to learn line dance.

By following her comprehensive guide that starts you with sections on beginners, intermediate and advance line dance. There also a section on line dance terminology. Her book and music is also extrememly helpful.

I bought her DVD/book/music as a beginner just for the fun of dancing at parties and weddings, but now thanks to Ms Lane, I am teaching line dance classes and loving every minute of it.

Thank you Christy Lane,

8509614,5,1889127272,"I have used this video to intoduce my elementary students to basic line dance steps.  Christy has a wonderful way of teaching in a fun, yet understandable manner.  My upper elementary students were able to catch on to the steps without frustration, unlike other line dance videos I've used.  Christy breaks down the harder steps into small segments so that it doesn't overwhelm the new learner.  If you want to learn a variety of line dances with ease, this is the video to purchase.  Christy also comes to the Texas Association of Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance Convention each year and attracts a huge crowd that is eager to learn her old favorites, as well as the latest dance moves. If you have the opportunity to see her in person, she will inspire you to attempt any style of dance.  She has many other wonderful videos that I have also used.  I have never been dissatisfied with any of her products.",1063065600,47,925,4.672839506172839
8509615,5,1889127272,This video made it so easy to learn all the dances. I had sat on the sidelines too embarrased to try in public. After using the video I was able to join in. This is a great way way to learn!,1062806400,17,190,3.658536585365854
8509616,5,1889127272,"My hat's off to Christy Lane for producing this great dance video! Finally a tape where the instructor puts her back to the camera so I don't have to turn my head 180 degrees to learn the steps.
I bought this video because most line dance videos only have about 5 dances and this one has 22 so I definitely got my moneys worth. Christy did a great job in the terminology section breaking each one down so I could breeze through the dances as she progressed to the intermediate and advanced line dances.
This video is a great resource containing all the #1 nostalgic line dances. I highly recommend it - take it from a real Texan!",1034640000,,629,4.338983050847458
