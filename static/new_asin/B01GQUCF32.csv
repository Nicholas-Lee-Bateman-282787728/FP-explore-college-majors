8763351,5,B01GQUCF32,"Thank God for inspiring you to share this message through this book and dvd study guide. So far we've had eight guys attend each of the first two sessions and hopefully we can get a few more in each week. The concept of what kind of legacy we are leaving for our families is definitely eye-opening, whether it be for someone who has adult children and now grandchildren or someone like me with a 9 year old. It has been great to learn from everyone's experiences and their backgrounds and there has been a lot of insight from the group because of all of the different points of view. Of course as a dad I could talk about my daughter all day long, which makes it easy in this setting to have great conversations about our relationships with our kids.
Even though I've read the book several times, when I am preparing the outlines for each week's session, it makes me more and more aware of the impact that I have on my child's life on a daily basis and how important it is to be constantly following the example of Christ, so that I am leaving a Godly legacy that she will continue and hopefully pass on to her children some day. It's a much needed and sometimes sobering reality check for me and the others in the group to think about how little time we have to instill those Godly principles in them and how quickly the legacy we want to leave them can get derailed.
I want to thank you specifically for the challenge of those middle chapters (or as I have referred to it, the ""heavy lifting"" portion of the study), which we will be getting into in the coming weeks and how that has made me more conscious of the relationship that I have with my own father and how I should be treating it as a Christian. As your analogy of ""Sam"" perfectly put it, ignoring the situation is not what God wants and now each of the men in the group have some guidance on how they should deal with their relationships with their dads as well. It will be a very interesting few weeks, to say the least.
I pray for God's continued blessing on you, on your family and on your ministry. The impact you have on those men you have reached - myself especially - is immeasurable and I hope that this group can have almost as great of an impact on those who are attending and on their families as well. Thanks again for your time and for your service.",1475366400,,2324,4.272108843537415
