5671132,4,B00BT765ZM,"The 411 by Maria:

I watched this last week and again this week with a friend and I must say, I can't wait to watch it again.

Two families, the Ostroffs and the Wallings who are best friends and neighbors.  One has a daughter named Nina who is away at college and way too busy to come home. The other family has a daughter named Vanessa who has always been jealous of free spirited Nina.  After a 5 year absence Nina finally comes home after she spots her boyfriend cheating on her.

Both families are experiencing growing pains of different kind, so when Nina becomes involved with David Walling instead of the Walling Boy (which is the wish of her mom) two families find themselves at odds.

OK...boring synopsis by me and everyone else.  I found the movie to be quite interesting. While I thought the relationship seemed weird, rushed and a bit flighty, that is probably because we don't see how they spent time together as Nina was growing up. Which would probably have made it that more strange but I digress. They just seem to fall into a kiss and I am unsure if that is because there was an extreme closeness, sexual tension (I saw none) or two totally pathetic people who would have simply made out with whomever had sat on the couch with them.  OK..while I don't get the relationship I enjoyed the dysfunctional family's ways of dealing with it. Nina's mom follows her to a hotel. Her dad is interested in how renewed his old friend David is now that he has a hot, new, young girlfriend (hello, his daughter)

The storyline was interesting, the cast excellent, the movie loses something because it tries very hard to tie up this relationship without it being twisted, dark and unappealing. Hello, he is 50 and having an affair with his best friend's 24 year old daughter. That is twisted. BUT....I liked it but I think that has to do with Hugh Laurie, Leighton Meester, Catherine Keener, Oliver Platt, Allison Janney and Alia Shawkat who were all excellent.",1369526400,,1967,4.581196581196581

5671134,2,B00BT765ZM,"This is more of a TV ""sit-com"" than an actual movie, and there is very little to recommend it. Not even Catherine Keener can save it. As to the plot, it tries to superimpose outlandish humor and over-the-top acting onto a more serious sexual/marital dilemma. And the formula doesn't work. In fact, there aren't very many laughs or social insights to be derived from this film.",1368403200,5,376,4.712121212121212
5671135,4,B00BT765ZM,"This is another feel good, feel awkward, sometimes humorous indie. The beginning of the film establishes the characters of the six main players. Two families are best friends. They do everything together, but not all is well. David Walling (Hugh Laurie) has been sleeping on the couch. His daughter Vanessa (Alia Shawkat) does some first person narration. Growing up she was best friends with Nina (Leighton Meester) who is part of the second family. Unlike Vanessa, Nina is a free spirit and Vanessa sees her as the antagonist.

Nina breaks up with her boyfriend and comes home for Thanksgiving after two years. The parents hope to fix her up with Toby Walling (Adam Brody), but Nina has suddenly developed a taste for older men, older married men who sleep on the couch. They are quickly discovered and the film goes into a mild disaster mode with crude comments from Nina's mom (Allison Janney) and snarky remarks from the hurt Vanessa.

The film had some funny parts, but for the most part it simply makes you smile at the awkward situation. The characters were well developed. The dialouge was decent. It has appeal and is worth a view, at least once. Leighton Meester did a great job.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex or nudity. Some crude sex talk.",1368316800,8,1254,4.7695852534562215
5671136,4,B00BT765ZM,"While this wasn't the greatest movie ever made, it definitely was solid. With a lot of movies I watch, I find myself stopping and starting the DVD every once in awhile as I get distracted by something else. So, for me to watch a movie from start to finish without interruptions is a rarity. This was one of those movies.
The plot is solid and believable, the dialogue is solid and believable, the characters are (for the most part) solid and believable, and the acting is strong from start to finish. Again, definitely ""worth a look.""
No real weaknesses anywhere, which sounds like ""faint praise,"" but really isn't, because so many movies these days have glaring weaknesses. So it really is nice to watch a movie that doesn't have any weak spots - makes it very enjoyable and satisfying to watch.",1367971200,10,796,4.652482269503546

The Walling and Ostroff families live across street from each other and are best of friends. One Thanksgiving Nina Ostroff (Meester) surprises everyone by showing up unexpectedly. This innocent act changes both families forever. For awhile now I have started watching movies without seeing the trailers for it. That way I go in with no real expectations and no idea about what the movie is about. I did that with this one. I knew the basic plot but that was it. I have to say I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this. The writing is very witty and funny and I laughed out loud most of the way through. The movie deals with a very hard and sensitive subject but has so much heart and laughs that it takes the pain away from the idea and makes it enjoyable to watch. This is a very good indi-comedy that I highly recommend. Overall, very very funny and very much worth watching. I say B+.",1366675200,7,1024,4.283505154639175
5671138,4,B00BT765ZM,"""The Oranges"" (2012 release; 90 min.) brings the story of two married couples living across the street from each other. There is Terry and Cathy Ostroff (played by Oliver Platt and Allison Janney). Terry and Cathy are best friends with David and Paige Walling (played by Hugh Laurie and Catherine Keener), whose marriage is not going well and whose twenty-something yr. old daughter Vanessa still lives with them. This is in sharp contrast with Terry and Cathy's daughter (and Vanessa's childhood friend) Nina (played by Leighton Meester), who is living ""la vida loca"" in San Francisco. Things go unexpectedly sour for Nina who, tails between her legs, moves in with her parents. The two families are enjoying their time together, until Nina and David develop a crush on each other (despite their significant age difference). At that point we are about one-third into the movie, and to tell you more of the plot would simply ruin your viewing experience. But as you can well imagine, all kinds of crazy situations develop from there, some of them funny, others bittersweet, and yet other moments outright sad.

Several comments: Hugh Laurie (yes, he of the ""House"" TV series) shows again with this performance how versatile he really is. (Remember a year ago he released an album ""Let Them Talk"", which was critically well-received.) I'm sure it had to be a relief for Laurie to be playing a character so vastly different from ""House"". However, Catherine Keener and Oliver Platt also bring choice performances. It's difficult to assess Leighton Meester, as it is hard to make that leap of faith to see what she sees in David, who is twice her age. Also it is a bit strange that the movie was released in early October (when I saw it at the Landmark E Street Theatre in Washington), as the Thanksgiving and Christmas holidays play a significant role in the movie.

All that aside, the bottom line is that this movie is more than just a 'romantic comedy', as the movie brings home some poignant moments. I found myself enjoying this movie a lot more than I had expected. If you are in the mood for one of those ""little indie movies that could"", ""The Oranges"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1352419200,34,2179,4.792553191489362

This is the story of two families who are friends and neighbors.  Both parents are going through difficult times when quite unexpectedly a major new complication arises: the good-looking, young-adult daughter Nina, of the neighbor couple, becomes romantically attracted to HouseI mean---to David Walling, as hes named here.  And since House-er, David, has been sleeping in the man-den alone for quite a few months now, its awfully hard for him to say noAll the predictable consequences play out [although lets face itin Hollywood, things that would be predictable in real life often don't play out in quite that way].

I won't spoil the story, but the characters' reactions to the main ""twist"" of the movie is a bit underwhelming and unbelievable. The movie isn't especially funny, and doesn't have much to say.

Leighton Meester's character, Nina falls for an older man, but that older man happens to be her dad's best friend and neighbor. A lot of drama ensues but this film isn't meant to be taken seriously. The Oranges is an oddball comedy, and sometimes it's just really nice to watch a movie that makes you laugh and forget your own troubles. I highly recommend it.

5671268,4,B00BT765ZM,"A bit of fluffor is it? This smart script written by Ian Helfer and Jay Reiss explores the conflicted views of society toward off kilter relationships through the tragicomic reactions of the two families and a few friends. These reactions, which range from awkward to furious, form the heart of the warm, funny, and occasionally touching movie. Some viewers may be distraught by the moral neutrality of the film, but since when did an intimate relationship between consenting adults, one of whom happens to be unhappily married, require censors to issue a strong moral condemnation? Not since the 1950's, yet we still talk about (and film) May- December coupling and other aspects of relationships that are far more detrimental to Good Housekeeping mentality than this story.

David (Hugh Laurie) and Paige (Catherine Keener) have a flatline marriage and a handsome young son Toby (Adam Brody) and funky daughter Vanessa (Alia Shawkat). They live across the street from best friends Terry (Oliver Platt) and Cathy (Allison Janney) whose wayward daughter Nina (Leighton Meester) has returned home from San Francisco for the holidays after breaking up with her fiance Ethan (Sam Rosen) after she catches him cheating. Cathy sees the perfect timing for Nina to re-connect with the very eligible Toby, tries all tricks to make this happens, but Nina will not be told how to respond. Instead Nina and David become entangled in an affair, which cause all manner of alterations in the friendship between the two families and the relationship between the parents of each.

In the hands of other actors this would just be a silly, flippant Rom-com, but given the cast and direction by Julian Farino it is a fine examination of human foibles. Grady Harp, November 13",1383696000,,1756,5.051724137931035

The cast is very funny. If you have seen any of these actors in previous films (and I am sure you have), the characters they play are exactly what you would expect. Given the quality of the actors, this is not a bad thing.

The movie offers a critique of suburbanism and consumerism without being as heavy-handed or blatant as something like American Beauty. While a comedy, it also is not as ridiculous as some other films with similar vents. The characters reflect on who they are and how they feel about their lives. Note that this is not a particularly romantic movie, although it would be good to watch on a date.

Unsurprisingly, the age-discrepant affair causes friction between the Ostroffs and Wallings. Consequently, Nina and her older lover decides to end the relationship, but have second thoughts after they realize that they're happier together.

In one scene Nina tells her distraught mother, ""If what we're feeling is real and genuine, then age doesn't matter.""

To which Nina's mother sarcastically inquires, ""Are you okay sucking David's old balls?!""

Nina, played by Leighton Meester, was not that likeable at all, and just came off as a selfish and immature h bag instead of a witty girl finding her unconventional way. The older guy she has the affair with, played by Hugh Laurie, comes off as a creepy old man and a horrible husband and uninvolved father. His daughter's role seems almost pointless. Terribly cast. Overall, I guess I really didn't like this movie that much at all.",1376956800,,846,4.761904761904762

5671310,1,B00BT765ZM,"I love Hugh Laurie. However, reading the brief description first on Amazon didn't outline the plot. It said, ""Fresh-squeezed laughs and sexy fun sweeten this critically-acclaimed comedy with an all-star cast.""

How was I to know that this movie showcased Hugh Laurie's ""zipper trouble"" with his best friend's 20 year-old DAUGHTER.

He watched his best friend's little girl grow up. Then he had lots of sex with her. Yuck.

His character struck me as a Woody Allen wannabe.

If my best friend's husband pulled that stunt with my own beautiful 20 year-old daughter, my husband and I would star in a new movie stealing the title ""There Will Be Blood.""

What a stinker.",1374883200,8,665,4.849557522123894

Then you throw into the mix the fact that one of the ""dads""  (Hugh Laurie) falls in love with his best friend's 20 year old daughter is a little too hard to believe.  Glad I didn't purchase this DVD.  It truly wasn't even worth the $3.99 I paid to rent it.  I must give this movie a thumbs down.",1373932800,2,427,4.035714285714286
