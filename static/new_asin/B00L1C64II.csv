6459447,2,B00L1C64II,"This was a ok video. I did not like how it when from one year to the next. It jumped around and went back to other years. It did not show airmen working in one job and how the base housing was,",1422316800,,193,3.619047619047619

6459452,3,B00L1C64II,"I can't give this dvd another 5 star rating like the previous reviewers.
The video quality of this dvd is horrid  The subject matter is good but it skips around too much.  The dvd spends a whole two minutes on the Vietnam War -- wow -- not much of a salute to all of those who served in southeast asia.
I needed a good dvd to show a high school class (Veterans Day lecture).  It definitely won't be this one.",1415491200,3,408,4.075

6459471,5,B00L1C64II,"I was amazed at how promptly my order of this DVD was sent and the courtesy of the company. I saw this historic Army Air Corps DVD on sale and immediately bought it for a friend who is 93 years old and was a crew member on a B 17 in WW2 that flew missions over Europe. He still wears his original Army Air Corps uniform for events. I know he will enjoy watching History of the Air Force DVD with its sections, especially the section of 1943.

6459480,3,B00L1C64II,"Don't buy this ""collection"" of rare videos. It's just old AF history videos that are available for free on youtube. The audio and video are awful which leads me to believe they just lifted them from youtube, and burned them to DVD (they couldn't even be bothered to to name the DVD file).

Update: Without my asking, Stonebridge has refunded me the purchase of this disc. This has led me to up my rating to 3 stars for the customer service (the customer service by itself is worth 5 stars). As for the product, still not the best for me. I was born into, and grew up in the USAF, and spent my summer hours in museums and the base library studying this history. So, if this video looks interesting to you, give it a go. If it turns out it's not for you, they will take care of you.",1452038400,5,780,4.2

6459488,2,B00L1C64II,A collection of USAF vintage video that is poorly put together and edited.  A video glitch with the DVD about half way through.  I didn't even finish watching the whole DVD.  Returned it.,1437782400,2,187,4.606060606060606

6459491,5,B00L1C64II,"I did receive the DVD and thoroughly enjoyed it. When I ordered it, I believed it would be more technical in nature, as opposed to historical. Upon receipt, I realized it was in fact historical. Being an aviation buff I enjoy the historical as well. It is a well done anthology  of the growth and change of the Air Force over the years.

I was hoping for more film about the early history and the part that I, and my squadrons, lived and made during the 60's and 70's.
