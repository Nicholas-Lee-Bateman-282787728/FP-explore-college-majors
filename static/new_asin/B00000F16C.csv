8133318,1,B00000F16C,"Although there is some valid information on this video it appears to be a bootleg.  Even the name of the company, ""Booklegger"" sounds more than a little suspicious.  The visual quality is extremely poor and it is recorded at EP speed.  There is less than 1/8 of an inch of tape on the supply reel.  The content is basic and like all golf videos produced by knowledgeable instructors you can usually find at least one technique or reminder that makes it worthwhile.  My only real criticism is the suspicious nature of this product.",996192000,,530,4.655913978494624
8133319,4,B00000F16C,"The video is a great knowledge of Davis Love III, one of the greatest swings in the PGA IMHO.  I believe that the video has great information and helps intermediate users to improve their swing to look good and hit good.",955065600,2,220,4.365853658536586
