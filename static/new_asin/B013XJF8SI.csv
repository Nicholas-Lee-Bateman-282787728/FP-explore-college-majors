8729162,5,B013XJF8SI,"A MUST HAVE time capsule for every music aficionado. In a way, it's a historic re-revelation of a fundamental turning point of music transition and pop culture of America, and the world. Watching this now and looking back, it's sheer brilliance. It encapsulates so many of the shifting social norms, cultural changes, race relations, and the impact music had on it all.

Disc 1 - ROCK N ROLL REVUE & RHYTHM AND BLUES REVIEW
This is pure gold. Magnificent! It's like sitting in a theater watching a vaudevillian live production  from the Apollo with classic comedy bits, tap dancing, and a whole lot of Rockin' Rhythm. There's swing, jazz, dixieland, rock n roll, rhythm & blues. Seeing Cab Calloway perform Minnie The Moocher (Hi De Ho) with only a 4 piece band is pure magic. Let me repeat that. It's Cab, and only 4 other cats. No big band. It's live. And he brings it d-o-w-n! You just gotta see it. Lionel Hampton on percussion (no, not vibes) is on fire during a performance of a wildly complex and intricate swinging number with his big band. Just, awesome. Nat King Cole drops a calypso vibe with nothing but his voice and a hipster dude playing bongos. Far-out man. You'll even see Count Basie's drummer, Louie Bellson, do a drum solo that's pure technical expertise of rudiments, paradiddles, triplets, all with a flipping wrist style. BUT THEN...his drum solo shifts and turns with a pounding beat into what may very well be the first arena rock style drum solo ever performed. It's a complete drumming mash-up of eras. Insane!

Disc 2 - ROCK, ROCK, ROCK
I'm not going to go into to much about the story line other than to say that, yes... This pre-MTV expose' to a time way-back-when actually does have a story line. If you have children with a curiosity for retro pop-culture and mid-century musical influences, this is an investment that will be heirloom material. It's a cavalcade of corn and camp. And it's coooool, man!

Seriously; This DVD collection, it's all about the music. And there's a lot. Check the sellers Editorial Reviews description for a list of all the greats performing on this set. Just to see Alan Freed (the ol' Moondog) actually conducting a Rock N Roll orchestra....And SINGING, is worth the price of the set. Yep, he sings. Absolutely classic.

The FILMCHEST  DVD rip:
Here you actually get a lot of bang for the buck. Both discs total 228 minutes. Don't be discouraged when you pop in either of the DVDs and the initial footage looks rough. All vintage ""newly discovered"" source film (no matter the condition) is going to have more initial wear at the very beginning because these are films. Sourced, discovered, or acquired. The key here is to find and select the very best source (or, master) that you can, and then go through a resto process to see if it's worthy of a reboot and mass production. FILMCHEST found such a sourced ""master"" worthy of duplication. In this particular case, just give the DVD a few moments. Get past the most volatile part of the film (the initial few moments of footage where the reels were loaded and spun over and over) and then you will be pleasantly surprised. To be clear, this is not remastered in HD...per-say. But this FILMCHEST DVD printing is impressive. It has gone through a restoration process because you just don't see vintage footage like this that looks this good. If you buy an old flick recently dropped on the DVD / Blu-Ray market, some can pass the eye test on a small screen. But the question is; Will this look good on a big TV?  Blemishes are  more magnified on larger screens. This DVD looks excellent on a 55"" LCD. But remember, this is in it's original 4x5 aspect ratio, not 16x9. Make sure your TV setting is for ""native"",  and not stretched. Haven't tried it on the projector 12' system yet. But the contrast is excellent and the clarity is sharp. Scratches, smudges, squigglies, etc., are almost none existent.

In my opinion, this DVD should be protocol for each and every middle & high school musical department. Teachers...Get this video and show your class. Turn it into a 3 day event and a learning experience that will have staying power with the kids. I guarantee it. Any family that appreciates and values music while still looking for an entertaining and humorous way of delivering a message that impassions  learning and appreciation for stage, theatrics, and of course music, it's a must. Fans of, or up and coming comedians? The comedy here is priceless from a learning perspective. Oh yeah. Last but not least; You music buffs, it's a given. Rock, blues, classical, jazz, swing, pop, standards, world beat....Each and every one of us will dig this vid. It's here on this FILMCHEST DVD...In pristine and glorious Black & White.",1445299200,7,4739,4.71825876662636
