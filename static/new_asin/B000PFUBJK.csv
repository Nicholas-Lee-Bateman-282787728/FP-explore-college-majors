2818495,5,B000PFUBJK,"I recalled enjoying this back in 1996/7 when it was first aired on British TV; so I dug out a copy and I just finished watching it.

What a beautiful drama, the acting is superb; scenery, gorgeous; and the story is thoroughly engaging.

The dialogue can be slightly difficult to penetrate at times, but not so as to seriously impede one's enjoyment.

One of those programmes that reels you in completely. I was sorry when it was over.",1207872000,8,434,4.538461538461538
2818496,5,B000PFUBJK,"This is a terrific series, but it does make some demands on the viewer.  The frequent flashbacks (sometimes flashbacks within flashbacks) can be confusing on a first viewing; the Scottish brogue is sometimes difficult to understand; and anyone who has not spent some time in Scotland will probably not fully ""get it.""  But if you make the effort to get past these things, this series is enormously rewarding.  I'm watching it for the second time and getting so much more out of it than I did at first.  Still, I loved it the first time too.  And I am not exaggerating when I say it sometimes has me in tears, it is so moving.

But if you're the sort of viewer who does not want any challenges, you should probably give it a pass.",1206576000,7,729,4.402985074626866
2818497,1,B000PFUBJK,"My husband and I love British drama and purchase everything or anything that has been shown on Masterpiece Theatre or any BBC production.  The Crow Road was most disapointing.  We watched 2 eposides on Disk 1 and sent the series back to Netflix.  The plot never ""got off the ground.:  The characters lacked chrisma and in my opinion, the plot was horrible.  I really didn't want to give it one star, but was required to in order to post a rating.",1203638400,7,446,4.45679012345679
2818498,4,B000PFUBJK,"I originally saw this on BBC America years back and recorded it on VHS. I am excited for it to finally be available in this region on DVD. What a fantastic story and wonderfully acted, by everyone, but especially Joseph McFadden who plays Prentice. You may have to listen really hard to catch some things they say but it is a great story so rewind a few times until you catch it all, it's worth it.",1199232000,15,398,4.25
2818499,4,B000PFUBJK,"This certainly held my interest.  I found it a little hard to understand some of the dialogue because of the accent, but it was worth the effort.  A young man, haunted by his uncle who disappeared under mysterious circumstances, goes looking for answers and uncovers a multitude of family secrets in the process.  Very satisfying.  Good acting, character studies, and plot.",1198800000,18,373,5.065573770491803

8191139,4,B000PFUBJK,I never got to see this when it was aired on tv so this for me was a great find. i have moved from Scotland to live overseas so as well as this being a good drama with Scottish actors it was also great just for the scenry. in fact i gave it to a friend to watch recently who move to Australia and missing home. Would love more of the same.,1399334400,,339,3.7222222222222223
8191140,3,B000PFUBJK,"As the three stars indicate...it's okay.  What is billed as a mystery I did not find very mysterious.  In fact, by the third episode, I couldn't give a ""tinker's damn"" about Uncle Rory.  You could literally cut this 4 hour mini-series down to 90 minutes and not miss a thing.  I generally love British and BBC dramas, but this was a struggle to get through.  You could refer to this series as challenging.

As one reviewer noted, the Scottish accent can sometimes be difficult to get around.  Actually, for the first 1/2 hour of the show, I really thought they were referring to Prentice as Princess...no kidding.

This is only for those Anglophiles that have the patience of a saint and can get passed the Scottish accent.",1387411200,,723,4.637795275590551
8191141,5,B000PFUBJK,"Having read the book before buying the DVD, I was familiar with the characters as well as the story line. Being a Scot it was easy for me to understand the dialect, also the humour! A keeper!",1377129600,,191,4.1891891891891895
8191142,3,B000PFUBJK,This movie was interesting but it was slow and hard to follow.  In the end it was OK but long time getting there.,1366848000,,113,3.9130434782608696
8191143,5,B000PFUBJK,"I am so glad Crow Road has finally made it on to DVD. I have been enjoying a version I taped from TV for years. What a pleasure to see a decent copy and enjoy this mystery,comedy, drama all over again. Great characters and fun situations. Lots of Scottish humor.",1360713600,2,262,4.26
8191144,5,B000PFUBJK,"This BBC TV adaptation of Iain Banks' novel, ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Crow-Road/dp/0349103232/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Crow Road</a>"" dates from 1996. It is perfectly attuned to the spirit of the book and I doubt that the many changes to the original story that have been necessary in order to present it cinematographically would upset even the most ardent of fans. The pace does start out a little slow, perhaps, but by and large, it is well handled over its four episode span, with each more gripping than the last. Performances by and large are good, with the strength of the dialogue making up for any hamminess in their delivery. Needless to say, Peter Capaldi shines in his role of the missing Uncle Rory -- a character who never actually appears in the book but masterfully added to the dramatisation by screenwriter, Bryan Elsley.  The musical soundtrack by Colin Towns is, characteristically, both highly evocative and annoyingly memorable.

There are a couple of extras on the disc, in the form of a general interview with Iain Banks, and a director commentary track on the first episode, which is well worth a listen and gives an interesting insight into the values of the production team without giving away any surprises for the later episodes.

Despite its age, still strongly recommended.",1343692800,6,1360,5.345794392523365
8191145,4,B000PFUBJK,"I've purchased a DVD for a TV mini-series I watched long time ago: The Crow Road. I received the pack clean and safe 22 days after I bought it. This was ok because I live outside the US.
The DVD are fine, I started to watch them again. I would like them to include subtitiles or CCaption but I haven't found them yet.
Anyway this I knew at the time I ask for it.

I'm pleased with the product and I think the purchase was a success.

Saludos a todos!",1298592000,2,450,3.988888888888889
