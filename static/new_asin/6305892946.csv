Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox Arquette, David Arquette, Parker Posey, Scott Folley and Patrick Dempsy make this the last  but the best of the SCREAM movies!",950486400,,257,4.586956521739131
1085188,5,6305892946,"When I first watch Scream I didn't know what to expect, I didn't really like horror movies and only watch it as all my college friends were. The result of this movie was simple, I don't think I ever enjoyed a film as  much. Then there was Scream 2, which was again a good movie, but not as  good as the original, as it was pretty much the same, and the posible  killers limited. So, when Scream 3 was released, I had to see it, but I  didn't really expect a lot. Scream 3 was brilliant, maybe not as good as  the first, but better than the second. The number of possible killer was  again huge and the twists regular. The story sorta goes like this....its  the set of Stab 3, and the killings again start, with the cast members  being killed in the order they were in the script. Dewy is on set as a  technical advisor, and Gail Weathers is helping the police find the killer.  The murders revole around the life of Sydneys (who's living in the woods,  but soon becomes involoved) mother Maureen Prescott, and then explains the  basis of all the movies. Scream 3 completes the story, it is very clever  filmand without doubt the best horror since Scream. I hope the DVD will do  it justice, as both Scream and 2 are presented on poor disks. Please let  them end Scream on a high, don't ruin a good thing.",950140800,6,1304,4.26530612244898
1085189,5,6305892946,"I'm a huge fan of the Scream movies and I can tell you that this was the best movie of them all. I love to watch horror flicks for the simple reason that they don't scare me but when I went to go see Scream, I jumped out of  my skin. It was not only scary but funny and a great use of imagination,  and you can't say that about a lot of films! Go see it, you'll love it!",950140800,,370,3.6125
1085190,4,6305892946,"I thought that Sream 3 was a good ending to the tilogy.  I liked it.  For the first time in all three movies, I guessed the wrong person as the killer.  I guess that my only problem with the movie was the fact that they  used that tape with Randy on it (if you haven't seen the movie, this will  not ruin it for you.)  I thought that that part was a bit cheesey, and I  thought that the creators should have been able to come up with a more  creative way of getting the information he gave across to the audience.  However, I do not write scripts, so what do I know.  But all in all, I  liked the film, I think that it was definitely the funniest of them all.  Go see it!",950054400,,671,3.888888888888889

1085278,2,6305892946,"The weakest film in the Scream franchise. Even though Wes Craven directed this, Kevin Williamsons writing talents are sorely missed. The previous films did a great job balancing the scares and the humor resulting in some excellent deadpan satire, this time around however, the scales tip a little to far on the slapstick end of the spectrum. At least it has enough backstory to make this entry canon.",1483574400,,400,4.897058823529412

Parker Posey stands out as the typical dysfunctional Hollywood actress playing the role of Gale Weathers in Stab 2.  Look for some unique cameo appearances as well.  The plot concerns a murderous mystery which evolves during the shooting of Stab 2 and ropes Sydney, Gale and Dewey back into the fore.  Scream 3 harkens back to the original Scream with the sets of Stab 2 replicating the home of Sydney in Woodsboro and also the one from Scream's finale.",1446076800,2,580,4.647058823529412

They did their best with the script they had and I remember being shocked at the end when I was younger.  If there weren't so many difficulties on set, maybe a solid film would have arose.  We may be stuck with a rushed and overlooked project but it's still fun nonetheless.

For the blu ray, It's the same that would come with the box set edition.  It has a slick menu and the transfer is very good.  I do wish there were more special features but of course the commentaries are still on there, along with the classic trilogy montage from the box set in 2000.",1420675200,,687,4.246153846153846

1085412,4,6305892946,"Wes Craven went for a trifecta in directing the Scream series and Scream fans were treated to the release of the 3rd Scream in this series that was released in theaters in early 2000.

The film opens with Cotton Weary, who has become a popular and controversial talk show host, being murdered by Ghostface after failing to tell the killer the whereabouts of Sidney Prescott, who has gone into isolation following the events of Scream 2. The Ghostface killer also kills Cotton's girlfriend, Christine in the process.

It's discovered that Sidney is off living in a generally isolated location, as a crisis counselor for an abused women's hotline. However, the new Ghostface will not leave her alone and calls her house, threatening her. This threat lures poor Sidney out of her hiding place and draws her to Hollywood, near the set of ""Stab 2"" (based off the events of Scream 2), being directed by Roman Bridger.

When cast members of Stab begin getting killed off by the Ghostface killer; Sidney, Dewey, and Gale once again must come together to solve the mystery of who's behind the Ghostface mask killing off people, this time in Hollywood!

Overall: Just like Scream and Scream 2, I enjoyed the plot overall for Scream 3. It was interesting to see most of the setting of this film take place on movie sets, hilltop houses, and such. Unfortunately, I feel that they made it too obvious as to who the killer was. When I watched this for the first time, I guessed who the killer was and low and behold, I was right. There are too many giveaways that go on for it not to be obvious. So overall, the premise is enjoyable and is watchable but the movie is way too predictable, which was a bit disappointing, seeing as how the previous Scream movies were completely unpredictable.",1401580800,,1776,4.6826923076923075

1085449,4,6305892946,"Ghost face isn't a character it's a costume.  I find that puzzling to say the least.  It makes all the murderers copy cats, plagiarists, wholly lacking in originality, nonentities until revealed and even then the ""surprise"" only works once.  At least this entry started out like an action flick.  That didn't amount to much, unfortunately, the rest was par for the course; a guy in a silly costume chasing people through buildings.  Run, chase, hack-hack-slash.  The prime motive remains the same: revenge.  It's always been a family affair.
The only thing that keeps me watching this series is the few surviving characters: David Arquette, Courteney Cox, and Neve Campbell.  In this one, Parker Posey provided a few laughs.  Carrie Fisher's brief appearance was jarring.  Otherwise, business as usual.  At least the big reveal didn't include an over the top performance, bug-eyes and people who don't know how to properly hold a gun.  Some rudimentary thrills but not a bit scary, the filmmakers don't stray far from expectations, they know their formula well at this point.

Me and my guy have been setting up The Scream Killings with an ending like The Noxhema chick in Urban Legends.

1085498,4,6305892946,"Certainly, despite the multiple murders, this is an almost benign entry in the Scream Franchise. I don't feel a need to compare it to the other two, this being the third in the series, but it does has a lighter tone and sticks to the point better. Still there is a sufficiency of screams (by the cast), ambiguities and warmth to satisfy the average viewer for the somewhat reduced level of real horror. The two lead female parts continue to be neatly handled by two actresses ( Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox), very different in type but attractive and talented. One of the female newcomers also puts in a good performance. It is a far cry from the best of Hitchcock but  I commend it to the audience which has seen the other two as well as those who have not.

1085534,3,6305892946,"I went into this Scream movie with low expectations as I knew going in this is generally considered to be the worst, and after seeing the movie and learning of its troubled, different and fast production I'm not surprised. While this movie does include the majority of stuff from the others and makes homoages to them by tieing them together and setting the stage for the ending, it doesn't fully succed and supports the cliche (proven just as much as it isn't) that the third act is usually the worst.

Before I go on, I did enjoy the movie, it felt intense in some areas, it did follow the rules pattern, I was glad with how the storylines ended but I have more complaints then likes for this film. See the movie first.

The movie does try to be good by giving a very surprising beginning, moving each character's storylines along in good ways, throwing in humor. giving Randy one more rules segment, adding new people and giving them much focus, more outside reactions to the groups perils, doing the new backstory later film installments do and revealing a big mastermind killer.

However many of these dont' work or are actually what hurts the movie. The focus on newer characters trying to track down the mastermind killer, hurts the movie as less time is spent on the three main people, Sidney espically as she is really a supporting character in this movie, who really is only there to get in trouble. The humor is more about people being patheitic, rather then well done humor. The tone of the movie feels different as the LA setting makes the movie feel more alien. The killing of Randy is actually made worse in this movie as it is revealed he dies because of breaking one of the rules.

Personal dislikes were that the killer was actually just one person, his identity came out of nowhere (let's make him the killer and not make it believable). Also this killer is back to stumbling into everything it's path which I don't like. Finally this killer didn't feel completly menacing lots of the time once his identity was revealed, annoying.

So it was nice to watch but is without question the worst one in the franchise and I'm glad it wasn't the last as, thankfully, this horror franchise managed to redeam itself and stay that way.",1359417600,,2244,4.6

1085536,4,6305892946,"""Scream 3 for some reason has always been the black sheep of the ""Scream"" family. Maybe the fact that Kevin WIlliamson bowed out of writing early on left fans filled with dismay. Truth be told, it isn't very scary and the comedy is played quite broadly as opposed to the satire so brilliantly constructed by the first two installment. But..the question remains...is ""Scream 3 really THAT bad or is there some hidden gold behind its rough exterior.

The film begins with Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), by called by Ghostface (voiced by Roger L. Jackson) demanding the whereabouts of Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) who has gone into seclusion since the events of Scream 2. He refuses and both Cotton and his girlfriend Christine (Kelly Rutherford) are murdered. Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) meets with Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox) to discuss the murders prompting her to travel to Hollywood, where she finds Dewey Riley (David Arquette) working as an advisor on the set of ""Stab 3, the third film in the film within a film series based on the Ghostface murders.

After Ghostface kills ""Stab 3 actress Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy) he begins taunting Sidney by phone, having discovered her phone number, forcing her out of hiding and drawing her to Hollywood. As the remaining ""Stab 3 cast gather at the home of Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey), Ghostface kills her bodyguard Steven Stone (Patrick Warburton) and uses a gas-leak to cause an explosion, killing fellow actor Tom Prinze (Matt Keeslar).

Dewey, Gale, Jennifer and the remaining ""Stab 3 actors Angelina Tyler (Emily Mortimer) and Tyson Fox (Deon Richmond) attend a birthday party for the director Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) where Ghostface strikes. Roman, Angelina, Tyson and Jennifer are killed and Ghostface orders Sidney to the mansion to save Gale and Dewey's lives.

""Scream 3 is the kind of movie that has a lot of great ideas mixed in with a few mediocre ideas. The film spends far too much time with Sidney away from the group, alone in the cabin. We want to see Sidney take on evil and put on a good fight. Something that doesn't happen here until the final act. That being said, Courteney Cox as Gale Weathers has never been better. Given a bitter rival to play against, played by a deliciously witty Parker Posey, she shines in every single scene that she is given. Overall, I think ""Scream 3 is a fun film. It may be the worst installment of the franchise but it is still a hell of a lot better than 90% of the horror that is released today.",1358640000,,2525,4.811059907834101

1085584,5,6305892946,"SCREAM 3 is lots of fun and finishes the original trilogy smartly.  As a film it is not as good as the original SCREAM but far surpasses the somewhat disappointing second film.  Back again is an intelligent script that provides the perfect mix of scares, suspense and quick wit all mixed together.  And Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox Arquette and David Arquette are back shining brightly not missing a step in their well crafted roles.  Supporting cast is also real fun.  Parker Posey is a hoot and Patrick Dempsey turns in a great dramatic turn fitting into the horror movie fold perfectly with his usual class and charm.  Was I reviewing the film alone I would be giving it 4 stars for only the original is a true 5 star film but the blu ray transfer ups the viewing experience and makes it a winning 5 stars and then some.

The video transfer is very good.  It is not as crisp as some but certainly an upgrade over the dvd.  Colors are bright, close ups are clean with great detail. Black/white ratio is excellent.  Both day and night scenes are well done.  This all adds to a dramatic viewing experience.  But the true star here is the audio. The DTS HD 5.1 track is amazing.  Dialogue is always crisp and strong and your entire surround sound system will be put to great use throughout.  Back speakers which are often not utilized well are definitely strong here. You will be jumping out of your skin as every effective scare is made that much stronger by the superb audio.  It honestly was like watching the film for the first time.  The blu ray transfer here turns a very well done film into something even better.  It uses all blu ray has to offer in video and audio to make the viewing experience an amazing horror delight.

1085599,4,6305892946,"One would think that two SCREAM movies would have milked out all of the ideas they had. Then again any fan of horror films, or follower of Randy in the series, would realize that a good horror franchise needs to become a trilogy to be great. Okay forget the new movie and just consider this one for the moment.

Gone are the days of school, both high school and college. The survivors of the earlier films have moved on with their lives. Gale (Courtney Cox) and Dewey (David Arquette) were and item but are now apart. Sidney (Neve Campbell) lives in a secluded and secure location where she councils victims via phone. And Cotton?

Well as the film opens Cotton (Liev Schreiber) has become a radio talk show host and is on his way home when he gets a call. One of ""those"" calls fans of the films recognize by now. The killer is in his home and about to kill Cotton's girlfriend. Cotton races home to stop this but fails and in so doing finds himself the second victim of part 3, his girlfriend being the first.

All of this occurs as a film studio is in the process of making STAB 3, the third movie based on the fictional murders in this series of films. I wonder if INCEPTION got their idea for a dream within a dream from these movies within movies? Anyway, Word of Cotton's death reaches the cast and crew and of course Gale is there to cover the story. In her usual insensitive manner she goes looking for the story. It leads her to the studio where the film is being shot and running into Dewey who is a technical advisor to the film, helping Jennifer Jolie (Parker Posey) as the character based on Gale.

The banter between the two goes back and forth but eventually they work together as members of the cast begin being murdered in the same order their characters are in the script. The killer also keeps leaving behind pictures of Sidney's mother, the woman whose infidelity began this whole story.  He/she also wants to know where to find Sidney.

Each cast member as well as studio executives and the police detective in charge of the investigation (Patrick Dempsey) become a suspect at one time or another. Perhaps the only ones not suspects are Sidney, Gale and Dewey. As the cast and crew are whittled down, the revelation of who the killer is this time around and his/her motivations are revealed.

It is the revelation that shows how original and interesting this series actually was. Once more they could have taken an easy out or done something that didn't relate to anything. Instead the film works as another whodunit where we are presented with clues that will lead us to the killer if we only pay close attention. Here we are again presented with what could have been a lame excuse for a movie but instead becomes a good little film all in itself.

The ideas behind movies are discussed in each of the films. On the surface this is seen when each one discusses the rules found in all horror films. But it also takes on critics who talk about how bad sequels can be, proving them wrong. It talks about how violence affects us by showing that perhaps the violence we see onscreen isn't what causes violence but the circumstances of our lives do. It talks about a press who is willing to sacrifice love, honor and respect for people in the attempt to get the story. And it talks about the fact that while we may make fun of sequels we still fill the theater seats to see them when they come out.

The series is well worth adding to your collection if you're a horror fan. Once again Lionsgate has done a bang up job of putting together a quality product here. The extras on all three don't offer much but I for one don't mind. I find that with all the movies I want to watch I rarely have time for these any longer. I mean come on, how come a movie can be 90 minutes long but have 3 hours of extras to watch?

Suffice to say that the SCREAM series as released now on blu-ray is a great buy for fans. Now all we have to do is sit back a few months and wait for the release of SCREAM 4.",1304467200,,4003,4.339572192513369

1085601,3,6305892946,"No spoilers here.  Read other reviews for that.  Just some thoughts...

I give this movie 3 1/2 stars.

I saw this movie in the theater when it came out.  It's a pretty good slasher movie.  It stars David Arquette, Courteney Cox Arquette, Neve Campbell, Patrick Dempsey, Jenny McCarthy, Deon Richmond, and Parker Posey.

It's a slasher movie that pays homage to other horror films of the past.  It also spoofs them.  It's definitely a different kind of horror movie.  I would categorize this as a movie that appeals mostly to a teenage audience.  I say this not only because of what's on the screen, but also the soundtrack, which features songs from then-current bands (some of which are still active), such as Creed, Slipknot, System Of A Down, Sevendust, Godsmack, Incubus, Coal Chamber, etc.

I heard that Scream and Scream 2 are better than this one.  I have yet to see those movies.  I plan on seeing them in the not too distant future.",1294531200,2,942,4.664634146341464

1085603,5,6305892946,"I try to be as honest as I can when reviewing Movies and I must say that this is a classic.  A ""must have"" movie for anyone who likes scary movies.  I will say that Most movies get worse as the sequels come out but this one is just as good as the first one.  I have all of the Scream movies and I would recommend them to anyone who has not seen them or to anyone who does not own them.  One of my favorites.

Obviously The plot surrounds Sidney Prescott (Nev Campbell) and the rest of the gang from Scream 1 and 2.  I will say that Randy does make a cameo appearance in this film even though he was butchered pretty badly in the second one by Billies Mother :P  The plot is honestly pretty much the same as the first two with a mysterious ghost face killer wanting to kill Sidney for some crazy unknown reason.  The reason is however ALWAYS made clear at the end.  With Scream 3 though I must say that you will not see this coming if you have never seen it before.  It was a BIG Shock to me when I first saw it.  The rules that applied to Scream 1 do not apply to the Concluding chapter in the Scream Trilogy!  You think you know the facts but the truth is you don't.  The past comes back to bight them in the behind and everything that they thought they knew about the past was WRONG!  That is precisely why I recommend this one to anyone who doesn't own it or has never seen it :) It is just a classic.  So go pick it up on here while there are still some left and please enjoy :)

1085604,4,6305892946,"I'm a pretty big fan of the whole `slasher' genre.  I know that isn't a very credible cinematic choice, but there is something about the whole `killer on the loose' thing that excites me.  No other `slasher' film has reached the heights of `Scream', and while neither of the sequels matched the originals pure bite, the third (and final chapter...until next year that is) film manages to reign in the mediocrity of the second offering and deliver a very satisfying (and thrilling) ride.

The film plays out with a group of actors being stalked by a masked killer very reminiscent of the killer who has been stalking poor Sydney Prescott for two other films now.  Seems like Sydney can never catch a break.  Regardless of the fact that she's uprooted her life and moved away, she is still being terrorized.  While the tacky movie series chronicling her horrors is being filmed (they are already onto their third film), Sydney finds herself once again a victim and soon everyone around her is, once again, turning up dead.

For me, the second film felt a bit flat.  I know that a lot of people raved it, and it had some interesting twists, but in the end I felt that the ending was forced and unconvincing and unsatisfying, and there was an overall darkness to the film that I didn't really enjoy.  I love dark and scary, but one of the greatest things about `Scream' was that it was terrifying while still managing to poke fun at itself.

It had wit.

Thankfully, this third offering has regained some of that charm.  It doesn't nail every nuance, like the original film does, but it snaps back with some freshness.

I'm happy to see that Neve Campbell will be working again.  I wish that she could nab some roles that were not `Scream' related, but for some reason no one else has aknowleged her talent, at least not lately.  Hopefully we can see a Campbell resurgence after `Scre4m' hits theaters.  She really is a talented young woman and she nailed these films effortlessly.

With a fresh cast featuring returnees like Cox, Arquette and Schreiber not to mention new blood like Dempsey, Foley, Mortimer, Posey and McCarthy' `Scream 3' is definitely worth the time of any `slasher' film enthusiast!",1274140800,,2199,4.699738903394256

The third Scream has an ensemble cast with new faces Patrick Dempsey, Park Posey and reunites us with Scream survivors (Neve Campbell- Sidney), David Arquette (Dewey), and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette). Scream 3 improves much upon the second film which many raved was better than the first, and I did not think so. I thought Scream 3 was an exceptional finale and best sequel of the Scream films. The third film investigates further into the bizarre and weird life of Maureen Prescott (Sidney's mother) and what she did before she joined Woodsboro and married Sidney's father. Sidney has left into hiding since college graduation and Scream 2 and has secluded herself deep inside northern California. Dewey has gone to films helping the Scream like Stab offshoots and Gale Weathers has gone to national media highly publicizing her Stab books and Scream experiences. The third film reunites them as someone in the Stab film set has gone crazy killing many of the cast and helps bring Sidney out of hiding, while letting Ghost Face plan his final move. Overall Scream 3 was much more comical than the first two with much applied humor. There was also a big set of surprises (including Cotton Weary and the killer at the end) as Scream 3 goes where no Scream has gone before, breaking all the set genre horror rules that the first two made up.",1267833600,,1492,4.786821705426356

It was also recently announced that ""Scream 4"" is in preproduction, and both Courtney Cox and David Arquette have stated they would be interested in reprising their roles.

1085608,4,6305892946,"In the aftermath of the second round of killings, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) has retreated to a house in the middle of nowhere and works as a phone counselor.  But her life is about to be shaken up once again when a new round of killings begin.  At first she tries to ignore them, but when the killer calls her at home, she realizes she has no choice.

The new round of killings seem to be centered around the production of Stab 3.  As the cast begins to fear for their lives, Sidney teams up with Gale Weather s (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dewey Riley (David Arquette).  Why is the killer leaving pictures of Sid's mother on the victims?  Who will survive the latest blood bath?

This is generally considered the weakest entry in the series, and the arguments against it have good merit.  Neve Campbell wasn't available for the full production, and Sidney's decreased presence really hurt the film since the franchise has always been about her.  Original scribe Kevin Williamson isn't back at all, and this film doesn't quite have the same satirical punch of the first two.  And the ending seems rather farfetched and out there even for this franchise.

Despite these weaknesses, I can't help but enjoy the film.  While the jokes aren't in the same manner, there are still some funny moments in the film.  The suspense in the few scenes is still very intense.  And the final fight is very nicely done.

While I can understand the complaints, I still enjoy this film.  It frightens and provides a few laughs along the way.  If you've enjoyed the first two, you'll want to give this one a stab.",1263772800,2,1598,4.590106007067138

1085612,3,6305892946,"I had purchased Scream 3 as part of the Box set of Scream films. Although the actual disc presentation and extras are exceptional, to me the film let me down.

The premise is intriguing: that there are more mysteries and unanswered questions surrounding the life and death of Maureen Prescott that even her daughter, Sidney, didn't know about. But somehow the plot premise that Maureen was a B movie actress in horror films seems so out of left field it really doesn't go well with the rest of what has happened in the previous films.

There are some excellent scenes and acting in the film. The most haunting being Sidney's visit to the movie set and seeing the exact replica of her and Stu's home from Woodsboro and viewing the scene of Tatum's demise. The opening sequence is also well done, but not as good as the other two. Parker Posey does steal the film as Jennifer Jolie and Neve Campbell is always good as Sidney Prescott.

An early sequence where a member of a class that Gale Weathers is lecturing asks her if after all the terror that has occured, it was really worth going after the story. That to me would've been a starting point to a similar but different plot.

My plot would consist of this: There is a third film being done in the Stab series, but they would actually shoot in the town of Woodsboro, which has the community up in arms. The attacks by the killer would be directed at the cast, but instead of just pictures of Maureen Prescott: the killer would leave pictures of all the victims starting with Maureen or maybe Casey Becker(Drew Barrymore). There would be another reporter but their story would cover the human element of the story, interviewing family members of the victims. As the body count mounts, a secret would be revealed about the Prescott family and the real reason for all the trouble would be revealed in the final act that would take place at the house where it all started.

I think the First two films are fine book ends, but the third one sticks out like a sore thumb.",1150761600,3,2018,4.517808219178082

1085614,5,6305892946,"Scream 3 begins, in classic form, with a murder. The titles roll and you're in it for what is presumably the final time. Scream 3 pays severeal homages to it's predecessors and is probably best viewed with the other two in sequential order. The most thrilling aspect about this movie is that it's the finale essentially meaning that those surviving characters you loved from the first and second enteries might just not make it in this final outing. That aspect alone got my butt in the theater opening weekend. I was a little turned off by the "" movie within a movie"" plotline that sort of carries over from the second movie, but after a while it grew on me. Scream was always meant as a trilogy and delivers this by crafting the story around three pivotal points in every person's life. In part one most of the characters are in high school. Part two picks up in college, while part three takes place in the working world. It doesn't sound so clever, but not many horror movies gain this type of commitment from their stars, so that this kind of story can be fleshed out. For this and so many other reasons, I gave Scream 3 five stars, no so much because it's the best of the Scream trilogy, but because it answers some questions, provides some closure and ends happily for those that survived.",1140480000,4,1296,4.495762711864407
1085615,4,6305892946,"With the success of ""Scream"", and the even bigger success of ""Scream 2"", it really comes as no surprise that director Wes Craven would return one more time to the surviving characters from Woodsboro, and finish his trilogy of terror with the release of the final chapter, ""Scream 3"".  But without writer Kevin Williamson by his side, can Wes Craven's ""Scream 3"" really live up to its predecessors?

After the terrible events that occurred around Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) in Woodsboro in ""Scream"", and the mayhem that followed Sidney to her college campus in ""Scream 2"", now to protect herself and the ones she loves, Sidney has gone into hiding via self-imposed exile.  However, on the Hollywood set of `Stab 3', the movie series based on the events that occurred on those tragic days in Woodsboro, the cast members begin dropping like flies in the same order as their characters are written to die in the film.  With these recent murders and suspicions rising, Sidney comes out of hiding to help her fellow Woodsboro survivors, deputy Dewey (David Arquette), who is now a bodyguard for one of the actresses on the film `Stab 3', and his former lover/news reporter Gail Weathers (Courtney Cox-Arquette).  Just when they thought they knew the rules of the game, this new killer has come along and broken those rules.  And this time no one is going to be safe.

""Scream 3"" rejoins the three main characters from the previous two films for one final time, along with director Wes Craven, sadly writer Kevin Williamson opted out of this final chapter.  The acting was about equal to the caliber of ""Scream 2"", which means that the acting continued to be fairly solid all around.  The gore, just as it was in the second film, was not as over-the-top as ""Scream"", but did seem to be a little more evident than it did in ""Scream 2"".  The story was still full of twists and turns, with plenty of thrills to go around, plus plenty of comedy to break up the dark proceedings.  Sadly, the humor sometimes takes front-and-center, leaving the drama in the background.  This problem, in my opinion, is based on the fact that Kevin Williamson chose not to return, though he had his share of problems finding a decent blend of humor and drama in ""Scream"", he skillfully mixed the two in his second outing with ""Scream 2"".  Some other aspects of ""Scream 3"" that were a little weak, most notably the clues being left at the scene of every murder were a little too convenient, and the actors playing parts in `Stab 3' were a little too unrealistically stupid, which made for plenty of humor but added to the dumbing down of this franchise.

Overall, not as strong as the second installment, yet still above the first film in terms of storytelling and execution (no pun intended).  ""Scream 3"" is a successful and enjoyable conclusion to Wes Craven's trilogy of terror, but I would have preferred that writer Kevin Williamson would have stuck around for this final act.

Rated R for strong horror violence and language.

""Scream 3"" is not as satisfying as the original horror masterpiece ""Scream,"" but what can we expect from the final chapter in a slasher trilogy? The first film was a superior horror thriller, one of the most loved slasher movies of the past decade. That was a picture with some hard standards to live up to; however, Wes Craven, director of the trio, accomplished another success with the sequel of ""Scream."" Usually this kind of movie would fade into the Hollywood recycle bin by now, but ""Scream 3"" still produces chills, thrills, and lots of surprises even though we have been receiving the same kind of story for the past four years. This film is marginally passable, although the most flawed film of its series, that fairs as recommendable, but not substantial in quality.

The film's opening once again provides the audience with a pre-credit murder sequence that is almost the highlight of the entire production. The ""Scream 3"" writers take advantage of one of the movie's old and important characters to arrange this very effective, and scary, sequence.  The setting is several years after the second film. The small college town of Woodsboro is where we are placed. Neve Campbell again stars as Sidney Prescott, a tormented young woman who was the target of the killing sprees in the past. She has attempted to move on with her life with her father, and has an anonymous hotline operation that offers assistance to those in need. Also, television reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) has experienced a big career jump, now working for a network called Total Entertainment. While the wrongly accused murder suspect of Sidney's mother, Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), has his own trashy TV talk show.  The central presence that connects the events here is the production of ""Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro,"" a movie the characters are creating that follows a horror trilogy based on the terrors experienced by Sydney. The masked murderer may or may not be found on the set. Besides police Detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), and the arrogant bodyguard Stone (Patrick Warburton), concluding the list of suspects, there is Dewey Riley (David Arquette), a former cop who is now an advisor for ""Stab 3,"" Roman Bridger (Scott Foley), the film's director, John Milton (Lance Henriksen) the film's producer, as well as acting counterparts Sarah Darling (Jenny McCarthy), Tom Prinze (Matthew Keeslar), Angelina (Emily Mortimer), Gabe Tucker (Deon Richmond), and Gales's reciprocal (Parker Posey).

Certain plot points lead our suspicion to believe one of several characters is the killer. We are fooled again; however, but does the killer's identity really matter here? As long as we receive a speech on why he or she is responsible, we would be satisfied and any of the character's could have been the killer. None of the characters have any shape or construction. We care only about the order that the victims will be picked off at, not about who hides behind the ghost mask. The identity is actually pointless when the slasher is finally revealed.  Once again, a key success in ""Scream 3"" is the scary sequences that build up momentum and thus work well, usually where the slasher kills his victims. What makes these scenes so effective is how we know that characters are three dimensional; they put up a firm fight for their lives, unlike victims in most slasher films. However, the plot seems to revolve around the murders, instead of the murders branching off from the story. ""Stab 3"" seems to be a central presence to connect the film's somewhat desperate through line.  Some of the plot points are fun and revealing. We see a videotape of a past character describing the possibilities of the movie's final outcome. This event programs our imaginations to suspect the unexpected. The plot does desperately attempt to fill in missing pieces of the previous screams, however, showing some signs of contrived foreshadowing. Each scene moves the story forward, though, replenishing the plot with freshness and ability around every abrupt corner.  ""Scream 3"" is a close call, and is given somewhat of a mixed review, but I still am giving the movie a marginal recommendation. It contains more startles, more surprises, and more effective scary material than most slasher movies.",1135987200,,4580,5.089333333333333
1085617,4,6305892946,"Normally, as a critic, we are exempt from the cost of seeing a movie. Normally, we get in for absolute zero when we attend a press screener of a film. However, since Dimension, for what appear to be highly mysterious (and controversial) reasons, cancelled the screener of Scream 3 I had to pay.

This is one movie that I did not waste my money on.

I saw this film in a theatre with about 700 other people, and the place was full to overflowing. Watching Scream 3 was reminiscent of watching a full-blown cult screening of The Rocky Horror Picture Show. People were dressed in full Mr. Ghost Face regalia (albeit without the knife), and the audience clapped, cheered, jeered, and chanted at practically every moment of the film.

To imagine the theatre I was in, imagine the theatre in the first ten minutes of Scream 2, remove the homicide, and multiply by ten.

In a lot of ways, seeing the movie in such a setting is probably for the best: I would have felt like such a silly ass loudly rooting for the killer in front of the rest of Cleveland's press contingent. My generation was raised on slasher flicks: they're our genre and our domain, and seeing Scream 3 with people of my generation was a refreshing switch from eating Thai food at the Ceder Lee cinemas with the rest of the critics.

Of course, it wasn't just the overwhelmingly ""this is campy, and I like it""-atmosphere that made me enjoy the film... Scream 3 wasn't half-bad either.

Seeing as Dimension has already handed down their edict up on high from the Greenwich Village thrones of Bob and Harvey Weinstein that no one shall tell the details of Scream 3, and since I don't want them to have an excuse to bar the Internet critics from their next the-NSA-couldn't-break-this project, I will not tell you much. What I will tell you is this.

Mr. Ghost Face is at it again. I obviously won't tell you who Mr. Ghost Face is, only that he has had a few upgrades. One, he can imitate people's voices (this is revealed within the first scene), and two, this guy packs a second knife (not revealed until later, but I thought you should know). This time he's killing the cast of Stab 3 in the order in which they die in the movie.

Only one problem. Stab 3 and Scream 3 have comparable security levels, so Stab 3 has multiple drafts of the script so that no one quite knows who is going to be next. Of course, Mr. Ghost Face is going after whoever is left from the original cast (by now we have whittled it down to Courtney Cox, David Arquette, Liev Schreiber, and Neve Campbell) while he is at it.

By far the campiest of the Scream trilogy, Scream 3 is undeniably fun. It isn't even structured so that it is guilty pleasure. It is structured so that it is following the rules of a sequel, not a trilogy, and thus everything is much more elaborately planned. The pace is quicker, the jokes are funnier, the IQ of the movie drops by at least 20 points.

Scream 3 chooses as the target of its insults not the horror genre but the Hollywood system. Stab 3's cast is wonderfully postmodern (each person corresponds to a member of the surviving original cast), but plays its insults to actors, actresses, directors, and producers instead of to serial killers, shower scenes, axe murderers, and chesty victims.

Ehren Kruger is able to step into the voice of Kevin Williamson without missing a beat, but is sadly not quite able to pull off a script without plot holes. The biggest thing that Scream 3 has going against it is the plethora of plot holes that exist in this film.

But this is camp, and we don't care.

In the end of Scream 3, when all is said and done, you are left with the feeling that you have just roasted marshmallows, made out in a drive-in, skinny-dipped in the lake, and done all of the other things that are both incredibly youthful and asking for it should you happen to find yourself in a serial-killer situation. The film is youthful. The film is Gen-X. But above all, it's fun, and it doesn't ever pretend to be anything more.",1133827200,2,4009,4.4603825136612025

Scream 2 3.5/5

Both good movies, and Scream 3 is still directed by Wes Craven, but it's not as good.  Why is this?  Well, the fact that there are no characters that are really likeable as an enormous affect.  I mean Neve, David, and Courtney are really like the only characters who we've known from the first film.  Jamie Kennedy was FOOLISHLY killed off in Scream 2, but he's in this one, you'll see what I mean.  The hot famous blond to bite the dust in this movie is Jenny McCarthy.  I think she's really easy on the eyes in this.  I first saw her in Python and she looks like 10 years older in that movie for some reason.  Anyway...I don't know.  You might like this, but it doesn't really have any classic/clishe suspensful chase sequences like Courtney Cox towards the end of Scream 2, and it's just kind of a rehash of everything.  Who really cares about the revelation at the end of the movie?  It doesn't make it any more rewarding or good.  So, what does this have going for it?  The return of Neve Campbell, who seems to have considerably less screentime than in the previous movies.  David Arquette, who is not as likeable as in the first 2.  Courtney Cox, who look the worst, and just seems in the way.  Random cameo by Jay and Silent bob, Roger Corman, and Carrie Fisher.",1113004800,2,1298,4.359832635983263

1085658,4,6305892946,"Scream 3 is a good film. Not great, but good.

 It certainly has a lot to live up to. The original Scream, when it was first released, was a refreshing departure from the belabored and formulaic cesspool to which horror movies had long since relegated themselves. Mixing an array of tongue-in-cheek self-referential in-jokes with legitimate terror, the first installment of this multi-million dollar franchise revived a genre that had long since been condemned to movie history, buried alive by such cinematic c**p as Critters 3 and Leprechaun 4: In Space. Never heard of those? Not surprised.

 Unfortunately, the sequel, and even the third installment to some extent, threatened to collapse in upon itself. Part of the charm of Scream was the way it mixed a clever hook (a horror movie that knows it's a horror movie) with some very simple, but plausibly disturbing murders and motives (or lack thereof). Cashing in on the success of its predecessor, the makers of Scream 2 hastily jammed together a conglomeration of dying college students with some shaky logic, resulting in mediocre fare. Although it has some great scenes (with the intro being one of the best and most ironic murder scenes out of all three installments), the second of the series seemed a bit too blood-happy. ""See here?"" the makers seemed to be saying. ""We're doing it again! Isn't it great?"" And we smiled and said, ""Sorta.""

 Well, Scream 3 is a winner. In fact, the worst that can be said for the flick is that its irony is often a bit forced, and it occasionally succumbs to the very cliches that it seems to mock. Although it doesn't reach the crystal clear tones of the original, it takes the same old cast to some impressive heights. The film is set on the set of Stab 3, a movie within the movie that is a fictional fictionalization of the actual murders in Screams 1 and 2, which are fictional to us, but not to the fictional makers of the Stab movies. Following me? Therefore, there are pretty much two of every cast member. Courtney Cox, for example, plays Gale Weathers, while Parker Posey plays an actress playing Gale Weathers. It's pretty cute.

 This gives the cast some artistic license, which adds to the humor and the tension of the script. With the performances by Posey and David Arquette (as the somewhat annoying Deputy Riley) by far the best of the cast, Scream 3 boasts not only some believable fear, but it also has plot twists that aren't ludicrous for once. Written by Ehren Kruger (the man responsible for the fabulous film Arlington Road), this final bow by the Scream movies is done gracefully and, thank God, unpredictably.

 Of course, there are some hitches. The killer, for instance, takes two ice picks to the neck, one to the chest, a nicely carved and varnished Victorian table to the skull, and several vases to face, and he/she still comes off with barely a bruise. Ah, but do we care? Not that much, really. Although some of the movie trips a bit over moments of unnecessary complexity and melodrama, those moments are few and fleeting. And although it can be said that the movie itself is not quite as substantial as the first, it is certainly a fitting and satisfying close to a franchise that never took itself too seriously to begin with.",1091491200,,3257,4.728395061728395

1085662,4,6305892946,"Scream 3 is the final chapter of the Scream series, and it finally concludes one of the greatest Horror movie series' ever in my oppinion. This Scream includes the survivors of the last Scream which include Sidney (Neve Campbell), Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox)and old Cotton Weary. At this point in the series' Sidney is out of school and lives with her father, isolated from civilization. She has taken on a new name and works as a person who gives advice to people in need of it. Dewey has become an electrical technician and is now working on the set of Stab 3 (which is based on the first 2 movies but is completely fictional to what really happened). Gale is now a talk show host, and Cotton is also a talk show host for a show called 100% Cotton. After one of these people die (trying to make this spoiler free) Sidney once again realizes that she is not safe. She wonders what will happen if the killer ever finds her. After a call from the new killer Sidney is frightened and after a few daus comes down to the Stab 3 set to find out what's going on.
The new killer has decided to kill everyone involved in the Stab 3 movie in the order that they die in Stab 3. The problem is that (hopefully) his plan will be foiled by the others (Gale, Dewey, Cotton or Sidney).
Screa 3 goes back to it's roots. It goes back further into the life of Sidney's mother and her secret life. It goes more into Dewey and Gale's relationship, and it is (in my oppinion) the scariest of the Scream's. The great thing about Scream 3 is that it doesn't follow the same formula as the other Scream's while still not taking itself seriously enough (remember shoot em in the head or they won't die and they'll be super human! haha). This is in part to the change of writers in the movie. Kevin Williamson doesn't write in this movie but produces the movie instead. I think it was a good change of pace for the Scream movies, and made this one the perfect way to end the series'.
So overall Scream 3 is a great movie, and is a definte buy if you've seen the first two. But it's not exactly like the first two. The movie foccusses more on Dewey and Gale then it does Sidney, which those who saw the first two know that, that wasn't like the last few Scream's. Overall great movie - should definitly get with the box set.",1084147200,2,2325,4.2984054669703875

I just wish they wouldn't have changed Gale Weathers, she looks completly different. She is so skinny you can't hardly tell that it is her. I definetly recommend buying this movie. Actually, you should buy the trilogy box set for only $35.",1079222400,,394,4.410958904109589
1085664,5,6305892946,"In 1996, Wes Craven had directed the cleverly scary and hip, SCREAM. In 1997, Wes Craven returned to the director's chair to direct SCREAM 2. In 1999, Wes Craven had directed and welcomed us to the final act: SCREAM 3

  In L.A., California, Cotton Weary (again played by Liev Schreiber) has returning to his L.A. home, where he has been shooting his Pilot episode to his talkshow entitled, 100% Cotton. He gets a call from a woman who claims to be his biggest fan. He asks for her name, making pleasant conversation, where the girl asks what his girlfriend do. Cotton asks how she knows about his girlfriend, where the Killer's voice takes over. Cotton's girlfriend, Christine Hamilton (played by Kelly Rutherford) lives with Cotton and is showering. The killer tells Cotton that he wants to know where Sidney is, but Cotton is smart enough to reveal that, but the killer hangs up after telling him that he will now kill Christine. Cotton rushes on home, as the killer appears. She locks herself in Cotton's in-house office. At that moment, Cotton's voice appears, but the killer is using a voicechanger that takes up your friends' voices. Cotton arrives at home, grabs a hotpoker and breaks into his office, where Christine hits him with golf club, but the killer appears and kills both Christine and Cotton. The killer is somehow linked to the latest film, STAB 3: Return To Woodsboro. STAB 2 was made after the events of Scream 2.

  Sidney Prescott (again played by Neve Campbell) is safely hiding in a very secluded suburban area. Sidney is now working as a Women's Crisis Counselor. She, at the moment, does not know of Cotton's murder.

  Gale Weathers, who is now an anchor woman for Total Entertainment, is offered, by Detective Mark Kincaid (played by Patrick Dempsey), to help the cops find the killer. At that moment, while Sidney is feeding her dog, the news reveals Cotton's murder. Sidney looks horrified, for she now knows that this is still far from over.

  On the set of STAB 3, the producer of the all three STAB films, John Milton (played by Lance Henrikson), Roman Bridger (played by Scott Foley), who is STAB 3's director, and the movie exec are talking about how the murder was possibly influenced by the making of STAB 3, while four of STAB 3's cast members are on a replica of Stu Macher's house. The four castmembers are Tyson Fox (played by Deon Richmond), Sarah Darling (played by Jenny McCarthy), Tom Prinze (played by Matt Keeslar), & Angelina Tyler (played by Emily Mortimer). In STAB 3, Sarah will be playing Candy, Tyson will be playing Ricky, Tom will be playing Dewey, replacing David Schwimmer, who played Dewey in STAB & STAB 2, and Angelina will be playing Sidney, replacing Tori Spelling, who played Sidney in STAB & STAB 2. Gale arrives on set to get a good scoop on the set of STAB 3. There, she meets Jennifer Jolie (played by Parker Posey), who has played Gale in STAB & STAB 2, and will be playing Gale again in STAB 3. They have a little competitive arqument until Dewey (again played by David Arquette). Jennifer borrows Dewey's cell, while he talks to Gale. At that moment Gale and Dewey talk bitterly, where Gale is escorted out.

  That night, Sidney has a nightmare, where she sees her mother's ghost, which turns into the killer's image. This ordeal is getting to her, seriously.

  The next morning, Sarah Darling arrives at the studio to meet with Roman. He isn't there, so she decides to wait. He calls her and tells her that he is ten minutes away, but decides to run through the script with her while he is on his way. The read through Candy's murder sequence, where the STAB 3 killer says that his favorite name is Sarah. At that moment, Roman's voice turns into the killer's voice, where Sarah is killed.

  Dewey and Gale head over to Jennifer's house. Gale, Dewey, and Jennifer find out that the killer is killing the celebrities in the order they die in the movie. The third person in STAB 3 that bites the dust is Gale. But, who amongst Gale and Jennifer will get killed? Luckily, there were three different versions to the script of Stab 3, so maybe Jennifer and Gale may have a chance of survival.

  That night, Jennifer and Dewey are in Jennifer's house with Tom and Angelina. Gale arrives to tell Dewey that the director, Roman Bridger (played by Scott Foley), who was arrested for the murder of Sarah Darling, being that he was supposedly the one who called Sarah, was released due to the fact that Sarah's call did not come from Roman's, but from a cloned cell phone and was very untraceable. After the first two murders, the killer left a picture of Sidney's mother, Maureen Prescott. Dewey picks up the picture left at Sarah's death. He looks at it and notices that the buildings in the back of Maureen look unbelievably familiar. He picks up a picture of Jennifer dressed up as Gale and notices that she is standing in the same spot Maureen is standing in her picture. Maureen Prescott was in Hollywood over 25 years earlier. While Gale and Dewey are discussing what they found out, Jennifer's bodyguard, Steve Stone (played by Patrick Warbutton) is murdered.

  Dewey and Gale return to the living room and discover that Jennifer, Angelina, and Tom are nowhere in sight. They suddenly come inside and find Stone's dead body at the front doorstep. Dewey and the rest run back inside and lock the door. Suddenly the power is cut and sends the crowd running outside. They suddenly get a fax. It's a re-write of the script. Only it's not the script to Stab 3. It's a script explaining who in the house is going to be murdered next. Who will it be? Gale? Dewey? Angelina? Jennifer? Tom? They run back outside, but Tom runs inside to find out what happens. The page reads, ""The killer will grant mercy to whoever smells the gas"". Unfortunately, Tom used a lighter to read the script. The combination of fire and gas blew Jennifer's house into nothing, killing off Tom. Dewey, Angelina, Gale, and Jennifer find yet another picture of Maureen. This time, on the back of it reads, I KILLED HER.

  Sidney arrives in Hollywood. Dewey, happy to see her, asks her why she showed up because it is not safe for her. She showed because of the call she got from the killer. She says she's no more safe there than she is in Hollywood, but in Hollywood, she's not alone. Sidney notices the pictures of Maureen in Kincaid's office. Gale asks her if she was an actress because the pictures looked a lot like publicity stills. Sidney has no idea. At Sidney's request, Sidney, Gale, and Dewey go and see the places in the pictures where they run into Martha Meeks (played by Heather Matarazzo), Randy's sister. Martha has found a very useful videotape of Randy (played by Jamie Kennedy) that he made from the second film. It explains that the Sidney, Gale, and Dewey are not dealing with a continuing sequel. They are dealing with a sequel that is the concluding chapter of a trilogy and tells them how to stop this.

  Gale goes off to find more info on this whole ordeal. Of course, the annoying Jennifer shows up at her side. The two head into the Archives building, where they meet Bianca Burnette (played by Carrie Fisher). Gale shows her the picture of Maureen Prescott and asks her for info. She tells them that they are look for Maureen Prescott and that they are not going to find anything about her. If they look for Rena Reynolds, they'll find more info. She hands them a file on Rena Reynolds. Rena Reynolds was the stage name Maureen was using while working as an actress in Hollywood. She starred in three horror movies: Amazombies, Space Psycho, and Creatures From The San Andreas Fall. The movies were produce by John Milton, the guy who has produced STAB, STAB 2, & STAB 3.

  Sidney, is in the bathroom, where she meets Angelina. Angelina runs off to Stage 16. Sidney realizes that Angelina dropped her brush. She runs after her, hoping to find her and return her brush. She walks through the set that appears to be a house that looks all too familiar, but can't put her finger on it. She exits the house and finds the set looking like Woodsboro. In front of her is a replica of her house. The house she just walked through was Stu's. She enters her house, with memories of a conversation she had with Billy in the beginning of the first film. At the moment, Sidney is attacked again, for third time. Trying to bring her down mentally, the killer uses the voice of Sidney's mother. Dewey comes to her rescue and has her taken to the police station for safety. Dewey is then approached by Gale and Jennifer, where they him about Maureen's acting escapade. They head over to Milton's office and find out some things about Maureen that no one has ever known before. They head over to the police station to tell Kincaid and Sidney what they found out. But instead, they get a weird call from Sidney saying she's heading over to Milton's house, where Roman is having a party for his own 30th birthday.

  There, all hell breaks loose when Tyson, Jennifer, and Angelina are murdered. Sidney is called by the killer, who has Gale and Dewey tied up. Sidney shows up to battle the next killer for the third and final time. Who is the killer this time? If you want to know, all you have to do is SCREAM one final time.",1077321600,,9279,4.58368580060423
1085680,5,6305892946,"ok so Scream 3 isn't the same inspired thrill ride that the first two were but belive me this is still a heart pounding, shocking, scary, freaky and emotional thrill-ride. Once again our ghost masked killer is back for some more, but this time he quite happly tell all the potential victims what hes going to do and how hes going to do it as well. From what they can figure out the killer is slicing people up in the order they die in Stab 3 (the third movie about the woodsboro murders)One of my personal faviourite scenes is when all the victims are stuck in a house while the killer is faxing bits of the script, while the actors are frantically trying to read the faxs there getting. I did find that this film is more energetic than the others in the trilogy. The whole feel of this film is actually more grown up, I think that one of the most extremely inspired murders is when Posey Parker gets stuck behind a wall of mirrors as the killer trying to slice her up to shreds, but dewey and sydney can hear her but cant see her.
Ithink that the ending deserves a paragraph to its self as it's what really makes this film as inspired as it is, I was a fan of the ending on number one but really hated number two as to me it just seemed really silly and completely unrelavent to the plot. This ending is real white knuckle stuff, there secret passages miror walls secret doors and much more Sydney gets beaten around so much that you really truly start to think that she could lose this battle and she very nearly does, the ending is very stylishly done with progectors and mobiles and guns and knives, you really start to feel the desperation that sydney is going through. you also feel sorry for Gail and Dewey as they frantically try to get to there friend.
All in all this film is one hell of an ending to a truly inspiring horror trilogy that will stay in peoples memorys forever and we can all just be glad that it didn't spiral into endless sequels that shouldnt even of been made unlike some horror series

Sydney is living on her own as a womans crisis counciler, and the 3rd STAB movie is coming out ( what happened to #2? )And she can't be found by her killer ( or so she thought ) and back on the stage of STAB 3, the bodies pile up of the CAST of STAB 3 but none  of SCREAM. SO they are being killed in the order they die in the movie ( STAB ) and police believe that it is by someone on the crew. Adn questions come up when they read about  3 different scripts to keep the ending from getting on the internet.

This one was packed with comedy, which I greatly enjoyed. It made me laugh out loud. The only problem is they did not kill off cast from the origional SCREAM.

1085685,2,6305892946,"Scream 3 is undoubtadly the worst film of the otherwise average Scream series, and is a career lowpoint for legendary horror director Wes Craven.  Without writer Kevin Williamson (who actually managed to give the characters some depth in the previous installments), we get one dimensional supporting players who we could care less if they live or die.  Parker ""The Queen of Independant Films"" Posey is the only real highlight of Scream 3; her performance makes the film somewhat watchable.  The cameo appearance of Jay & Silent Bob is also a nice surprise, but the rest of the film is mostly downhill from there.  The series' overall interlinking storyline has become more jumbled and ridiculous this time around, and while it offers a few good scares and some nice kills, Scream 3 is otherwise a dud.  Returning stars Neve Campbell, Courtney Cox, and David Arquette are back, as well as original members Jamie Kennedy and Liev Schrieber in cameos, and the rest of the cast includes Patrick Dempsey, Jenny McCarthy, Scott Foley, and Lance Henriksen.",1067558400,2,1049,5.005747126436781
1085686,4,6305892946,"By the time that Scream 3 was released around the turn of millennium, pretty much everyone in the world was familiar with the style of the film, and its storyline. Such is the immense popularity of this film series that you can't help but not think of it when you think of the horror genre. The first Scream film was ground-breaking and original in every way possible while Scream 2 slightly improved the suspense and nail-biting moments while retaining the same old formula. With Scream 3, director Wes Craven has wisely drawn a line under this phenomenon and called it a day. However, Scream 3 is no bad film. It's a great ending to a fantastic trilogy, but one thinks that anymore films in this series would become too predictable and familiar.

In Scream 3, Kevin Williamson, scrip writer from the first two instalments is absent. Unfortunately the absence is painfully noticeable. The scrip goes too far and tries to reach areas of the storyline that are too deeply rooted in the unfamiliar to be believable after all that has happened in the first two films. The film attempts to complete the circle by rounding it off with this film, yet it can't help but bringing in new facts and stuff like Maureen's ghost that we really didn't need to know. The long and overdrawn explanation of everything that has happened towards the end is not really needed either. You finish watching the film feeling a little disappointed by the lack of action and suspense, but there's certainly one thing that this film has in copious amounts that the first two didn't - blood and guts.

Most of the action that goes on in Scream 3 is featured on the Hollywood-style set of Stab 3, the sequel to the original which featured the true-story events of Sidney's events that we saw in the first Scream film. Stab 3 focuses more on Gayle Weather's account of the goings on around the Woodsboro Murders. Having the characters of Stab 3 play the real life characters that we seen on screen is a delightful touch, and adds many humorous moments to the film. As with the first two films we are treated to a fabulous opening sequence that last some ten minutes to get the audience worked and hyped up. With Scream, we saw Drew Barrymore brutally murdered in the opening, while Jada Pinkett was killed off in the cinema in Scream 2 while watching the Hollywood blockbuster Stab. This opening is the worst of the three, but it's still very good and entertaining.

Neve Campbell completes her role as Sidney Prescott in Scream 3 with grand style. Her acting peaks here and she shows raw emotion as the traumatised woman. Courtney Cox is fabulous once more as the news reporter Gayle Weathers, but she has lost her snappy edge from the first two instalments that made her the shiniest character in the film. David Arquette has now fully transformed into a very likeable character, and is a different man to the geek we saw in the first film. And that's pretty much it as far as main cast stars go. Scream and Scream 2 had many extras and minor role-players, but Scream 3 focuses more on the three main characters who have been in the film since the beginning.

OVERALL GRADE: 8/10

Scream 3 is definitely a satisfying and well-received finale to the greatest slasher flick trilogy ever. The ending is the second best of all the three, with the original Scream ending in pole position. Nothing can top that! Final instalments are supposed to ruin some classic films. Many examples can be chosen, such as The Omen and The Exorcist, but Scream 3 is a perfect round out to the best trilogy ever, Scream. Let's just hope, however, that Wes Craven doesn't release a Scream 4. The results could be disastrous. We might just have to kill him.",1067126400,,3705,4.633181126331811

After watching the orignial Scream, I viewed it as a gewl, a gem of it's own kind, it sparked a new genre of horror films that have been dead for nearly a decade. It was a classic and spinned off look alikes, such as I KNOW WHAT YOU DID LAST SUMMER, and many many others. In 1997 SCREAM 2 was released, and it was very dissapointing. It didn't have what it took to pass the predescessor. It was wasn't written richly, but a very bad let down. Now SCREAM 3 was released February 4th, 2000.

Rany Meeks makes an appearnce, as his sister shows her a video tape before he died in Scream 2, explaining that in the Trilogy anything can happen, even Sydney can die. He says that a shot in the head, or freezing the villian will only kill him. The film opens up with two murdes like the predescessors.

1085714,5,6305892946,"You know how the old saying goes. Everything must come to an end. Sadly, one of the best and most clever series in the genre closes it's final chapter with 'Scream 3'. Even though thr franchise was only around for a little over 3 years, it felt a lot longer. Kevin Williamson was absent on this entry, unfortunatley, but Ehren Krueger, who went on to write ""The Ring"", steps up and does a great job. The master, Wes Craven, also returns. Part 2 set up the rules for a horror sequel, but this time around our gang of characters and newbies are playing by the trilogy rules. All bets are off. We pick up a ways into the future as we are re-introduced to heroine Sidney Prescott, once again played with heart and conviction by Neve Campbell. She has become a recluse living in the hills, who has never forgotten the horrors she has seen. Gale Weathers(Courteney Cox)is back on the prowl, as is Deputy Dewey(David Arquette), who is working as a consultant on ""Stab 3"", a sequel to the film series that was turned into a movie from Gale's book, ""The Woodsboro Murders"". Gale is also being followed by an actress(Parker Posey), who is playing her in the ""Stab"" films. As production on the new film commences, a new killer pops up and the body count begins rising. It appears that the killer is going thru the script knocking off the actors in sequence as they die in the script. The only problem is that there is a different draft of the script, and no one knows which on the killer is going by. This leads Sidney out of hiding to become the killer's number one target again. New revelations are revealed about Sidney's past and all the connections from the first film are brought back up and given a real ending. It's a smart way how they tie it all up. This sequel is really a movie within a movie. We see re-creations of sets from the first film on movie lots and that whole bit. The new film introduces us to other new characters as well. Deputy Kincaid(Patrick Dempsey), who is assigned the new case of killings. Roman Bridger(Scott Foley of ""Felicity""), the director of the new film. Jenny McCarthy, Deon Richmond, and others fill out the cast of the ""Stab Movie"". Liev Schreiber returns as Cotton Weary in the film's glorious opening. Horror director Roger Corman has a small cameo, and veteran actor Lance Henriksen plays the film's shady producer. It was slightly evident in this entry that the series was going to paint itself into a corner. By now, we pretty much knew the game and how things worked in a 'Scream' movie. The problem is that Craven and Krueger pretty much stick to the formula and don't really do anything new or refrshing like they did in the original. Some of the story's end resolutions bring some surprises, but the film as a whole really doesn't. But don't think for one second that this in any way hurts the film. It's still an intriguing tale that delivers incredible fun, thrills, chills, and unending entertainment. As for our characters, they are still the heart and soul of these films. What's surprising here is that Neve seems to of had a smaller part. This seems to be more of a Gale movie since that character appeared to have more screen time than Sid. Of course, Sidney really comes into her own and becomes the main victim once again. Didn't it look like Courteney Cox was wearing a wig in this film?. Jamie Kennedy also returns in a brief cameo, via video, as Randy. If this is truly the end, then it goes out in grand style. The last scene with Sidney and the opened door was a real nice touch. The movie is still clever, witty, suspenseful, and a lot of fun. It is ten times better than a part 3 in a horror series has any right to be. That is quite an accomplishment in itself.

The first one [was bad], the 2nd one was better, but this is easily the best in the series. It just barely makes a 3.5. This third installment of the hugely popular Scream trilogy doesn't have the moxie and smarts of its two predecessors, but it's still a great thrill ride. The Scream Trilogy has to be one of the most influential trilogies since Star Wars and the Godfather. The first Scream, it was easy to figure out the killers, in Scream 2 they made it harder, but I didn't guess right in Scream 3 though. So anyway, these aren't really that scary, but Scream 3 does have effectively scary parts. As I said, the slashers that came before it are FAR superior to these, but for some laughs and a couple of cheap thrills, you should buy this along with Scream & Scream 2.

After watching Scream and Scream 2, you pretty much know what could occur. I will admit that there were some twists that were unexpected, but after the initial shock was over, you were left thinking, ""why did they do that?""
The ending, no matter how suspenseful, made me want to scream at Wes Craven. I felt that he could have come up with something much better than Sidney's long lost brother being the killer. Scott Foley didn't seem like the best casting choice, but he served his purpose.
I guess it was a little disheartening to find that many of the characters that the audience has grown to love in the previous movies were killed off all because of a stupid plot twist.
Don't get me wrong, the entire Scream trilogy is good, but if you can, I would definitely skip this third installment.",1043712000,,974,4.5397727272727275

Her story is being turned into a movie and one by one, the actors in the movie are being picked off in a very terrifying manner. Each more individual than the last. Get ready for the finale of Scream because this one will get you going.
O.k. let's start out, seeing as how this is the end to a scary movie, there's more blood and the body count is significantly higher. There are numerous twists and turns in the plot and honestly there's no safe bet on who the killer is this time. So really, all bets are off.
I won't give away too much because seriously, even the slightest give aways really hurt this movie! But why is that Dewey (David Arquette) back again?! That will always bother me about the Scream series that a character that should have been dead in the first movie, wasn't.

I think that they could have made the sequel a bang by having Randy be the killer somehow, and have him live, but it's not so...  Anyhow the only problem that I have with this one is that it gets slow sometimes and I think if they had one more killing scene between the grand finale and the 3rd person killed than I could've gotten through.  Also I just don't like how they don't make everyone a suspect like in Scream 1, but has more suspects than 2.

 The third and final Scream finds Sidney Prescott living in isolation and in fear of once again being stalked. Dewey Riley and Gail Weathers are coincidentally teamed up when Cotton Weary is killed in true Scream - or in  their world, Stab - fashion. Again, they are united with a cast full of stereotypical yet fun characters (Especially Parker Posey) who run, die, and try to outwit whoever is under the mask.
 I, for one, am glad they ended this series with a third installment. Even though this movie is entertaining and deals a deserving ending, I could see the series getting old with another installment. Just how many people would have a reason to kill Sidney? But like I said, Ehren Kruger came up with a final resolution that tied all three movies together in good fashion.
 The DVD is a complete fan's choice with features such as hilarious outtakes, a behind-the-scenes montage, a couple of deleted scenes (An interesting alternate opening), an alternate ending, Creed video (I love it), trailers, a LOT of tv spots, audio commentary, and I do believe there may be one or two things I'm missing.

As most other viewers have noted, the series kind of goes downhill after the first one, and continues with, in my view, the weakest of the three with Scream 3.  To me, something just seemed different with Scream 3.  The previous two were very well acted, and you cared about the characters, and you wanted to experience things with them.  But, after viewing the third scream, I just didn't get the same sense of connection.
Sure, it was still entertaining to guess who the killer was, and there was always a twist, and I am not knocking the ending completely, but...because of the ending they chose, they really didn't need to make 3 screams, because this ending just kind of comes out of the blue.  They could have really just made this last one as the only scream and everything would have been fine, because the first two don't really mean anything after seeing the third.  Atleast, that is the sense I got from it.
Again, it is entertaining, but, the acting just falls off completely, everything seems [poor], and the actors seem to fake every scream (I am wondering though, because they are the Stab actors, maybe Craven wanted it that way, to display how fakey and cheap ""Stab"" was supposed to be).  I also didn't like their loud screams anytime something happened, like someone startled them, everyone was always screaming, and this tends to annoy you, and lessen the meaning of real screams, so they don't startle you as a viewer much anymore.

Again, the Ghostface Killer stalks and kills and its up to the cast to find out who the killer (or killers) is/are before its too late.

As always, several thing are going on at once. Cotton Weary [Liev Schreiber], exonerated as the killer in a past episode, has become a hot syndicated TV talk show host. Driving home in Los Angeles one night, he gets a phone call from the real killer. He races home to save his girlfriend. Sidney Prescott [Neve Campbell] has vanished to a remote area of northern California where, safely locked away in a secure ranch, she works as an over-the-phone crisis counselor. Naturally, this is one mad man she can't escape. In Hollywood, a studio is making Stab 3, a movie about the killings covered in Scream and Scream 3. Dewey [David Arquette] is technical advisor on the picture. Gale Weathers [Courtney Cox Arquette] is a highly paid and sensationalistic TV journalist. When Cotton has a fatal encounter while trying to save his girlfriend, Gale is called in by the LAPD as a consultant. That's how she runs into Dewey on the movie set. After a couple of the cast members are done in, the pair realizes that the serial killer is working in the order in which the characters the actors are playing were killed.
The problem with the picture is that director Wes Craven really has run out of ideas. It is almost as if he simply filled a prior commitment. The satire and the humor that made the first two movies so good is almost absent here, which makes this one basically a competent but ordinary horror movie. There are some spooky scenes, such as one in which Sidney is chased by the killer through the Stab 3 set, which is an exact replica of her own house where much of the original movies took place.
The actors give good performances, especially Neve Campbell and Courtney Cox Arquette, although they, too, have an air of doing this movie because their contracts said they would.

1085762,4,6305892946,"Four long rip-off filled years after the world was first introduced to the world of Sydney Prescott, Deputy Dewey, and Ghostface, Director Wes Craven released the highly anticipated sequel Scream 3, the third and final chapter of what would ultimately became one of the most affectionately beloved horror franchises of the 1990's, to the world. For all of his fans around the globe who had considerably shoved the previous Screams to immense commercial dominance and lasting cultural impact around the world, Craven was authoring one last concluding passage to the films that film audiences eventually would realize was originally intended to be a Trilogy by Scream creator/screen writer Kevin Williamson himself. This alarmingly frank yet insidiously cunning last major innovation of the series that defined 90's horror allows Scream to defiantly defy cinematic trends, rules, and formulas once again by choosing the method, style, and course of it's demise. Just like it's inception, the Scream series seared through its life cycle and the Hollywood establishment like a blaze of glory eliminating the old and creating a gamut where new ideas and innovation could grow out of the ashes of Hollywood's deplorable repetition of thought.
As for Scream 3's tale, we pick up our story a few years after the traumatic events of Scream 2; Hollywood is still reaping some insanely lucrative rewards from the past two homicidal rampages that directly involved poor psychologically troubled Sydney Prescott and her friends. On the set of Stab 3, some unusual trappings of malice begin to develop as cast members, familiar Scream faces making cameo appearances, and crew members start to turn up slaughtered and covered with cryptic photographs of a strangely familiar young woman who may have been an actress in Los Angeles back in the Golden Age of Hollywood. This baffles authorities who bring in Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dwight ""Dewey"" Riley (David Arquette) to investigate the similar Modus Operandi of these killings with that of the previous Ghostface sightings. Is there a correlation between these incidents? How does Sydney play in to all of this? What further mysteries exist in the mythology of the Scream pictures? These and many more doubts are questions that you're going to have to determine for your self by watching this terrifically savvy movie, but I promise you won't be dissatisfied by what you see.
Scream 3 conclusively wraps up the Scream Trilogy narrative with profuse intelligence, engaging enthusiasm, plentiful trademark horror references, all the familiar faces that are alive and not (No there's nothing supernatural in this movie. Just watch!), characteristically virtuoso Craven directorial touches that bring Scream back to it's thriller based roots, the rapidly stellar satirical touches of the previous films, and another radiantly extraordinary performance by Neve Campbell to decisively create another daringly original horror film form Wes Craven and Kevin Williamson.
As for Scream 3's DVD edition, it includes a stellar anamorphic widescreen presentation, a revealing Wes Craven commentary track, deleted scenes, a deleted alternate ending with Wes Craven commentary, Creed's ""What If"" Music Video, and series outtakes from all three films to solidify a very consumer friendly package.

""This shockingly fun thriller really knows how to end the trilogy, but it's nothing more than I expected.

THAT IS TOO EXPECTED!  They do that in all horror movies!  Especially the SCREAM movies, they really point it out!  Wouldn't WES CRAVEN figure out that we've gotten passed that????  Who knows.  Yet I was satisfied with NEVE CAMPBELL, DAVID ARQUETTE, and COUTNEY COX ARQUETTE's performances.
The film was overall, chilling- but not scary.  There were some laughs, but a lot of the humor was just dumb.  The ending was a fine way to really END it.  The trilogy idea was great and original.  The main performances were pretty good.  Yet the film was rather expected and typical- until the end- it was still a fun film to see and try to guess who the killer is.

First, the leads (Campbell, Arquette, and Cox-Arquette) managed to have fun even though they had to play the same characters getting chased and abused by the different killers.  And the supporting cast is great:  Scott Foley as the plagued director; Parker Posey is superb as Gail's film character (she actually steals the movie!); Patrick Warburton as the macho guard is just fine; Carrie Fisher's cameo as the video archivist is priceless.  Lance Henriksen falls short only because he looks totally bored, which is unusual since he is such a good presence in so many other films.

Score: 80/100
It was the big question, could Scream 3, the end of the highest-grossing horror franchise in history, live up to its 2 fantastical predecessors? The answer was a very convincing yes. Scream 3 is so hip, cool and watchable that you can't help but love it.
After the terrifying events that occurred around Windsor College, Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell) is now living alone in a secluded Northern California mountainside. Still haunted by her past, frightening images of her dead mother reappear time after time in her head as she tries to get on with her life. She now gives advice, under a fictional name for safety, to women in crisis via telephone. Soon enough though, her comfort turns to fear as she receives a threatening phone call from an anonymous source who informs her on the recent murders committed around the Hollywood set of ""Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro, the third and final chapter to the 'Stab' series. Sidney decides to visit the set when she finds out that with every victim, the new killer leaves behind a different photo of Sidney's deceased mother, Maureen Prescott. Eventually the cast of ""Stab 3"" start dying one by one and more photos of Maureen appear. Mark Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey), an LAPD detective, is sent to investigate the strange murder and becomes friendly with Sidney. Meanwhile, Gale (Courteney Cox Arquette) visits the set of ""Stab 3,"" after she hears of the murders. Ironically, she meets up with Dewey (David Arquette), who is now working behind the film alongside his actress/girlfriend Jennifer (Parker Posey). Gale, Dewey, and Sidney rejoin along with the actors and actresses of ""Stab 3,"" who are all shaken up by the rest of the cast being killed off. As the secret to Sidney's past unfolds, the three discover that in the trilogy, anything can happen.
It's amazing how many bad reviews this superbly timed third chapter got. It's entertaining, it's funny, it's clever, it's got plot and it's got blood, so anything else anyone was expecting from the Scream trilogy was obviously out of their league. The new team and oldie's all co-operate to make Scream 3 successful, and the performances are great, particularly from Campbell and Posey, who light up the screen as Sid and Jennifer. David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette stay on their usual great form, and all the characters come in some use. Scream 3 is also immediately different from the first two films as it has much more cameos, including Kevin Smith creations Jay `Phat' Buds and Silent Bob, and Carrie Fisher who actually makes a joke about her casting on Star Wars! The film also has a fun, campy feel to it and it knows exactly what it's doing and how to do it.
You may be going `Oh, whatever!' when the killer finally takes off the mask, nevertheless this is still endlessly inventive and mercilessly entertaining, and must not be missed by all audiences who enjoyed the first two films.",985392000,,2924,4.838323353293413

Scream 2 dissapointed audiences with nothing but just another horror film, but Scream 3 corrected that and brought the sereis to an end. Scream 3 was

1085881,5,6305892946,"Poor Sidney has now changed her name to Lara and is working for a woman's crisis center. Meanwhile Hollywood are making a new Stab movie, Stab 3: Return To Woodsburrow. After a murder the police hire Gale Weathers to check out the film to see if there are any suspects. There she meets Dewy who is the technical adviser. It doesn't take them long to realise that the killer is killing the cast in the order they die in the movie, the only snag being there were three scripts made to keep the ending off the internet. The body count (along with the tension) rises and the killer leaves pictures of Sidney's mother after each killing.  Scream 3 is the final instalment of the Scream trilogy. The makers are probably going to make a forth one. If this is the  last ending it's a brilliant way to end it. the killer has now changed his routine, which is so good that the audience won't even see him coming. A video tape of Randy Meeks is shown that explains the rules of a movie trilogy.  1. Anyone can die, even the main character.  2. The killer will always be super human, meaning tougher to kill.  3. Something from the past will come back, meaning the past is not at rest.  This one has the biggest body count of the three films and possibly the most humour. The film is also full of expendable  new comers, like Jenny McCarthy, Parker Posey. It also has some cool cameos, like Jay and Silent Bob (Clerks, Mallrats, Chasing Amy and Dogma), who were created by Kevin Smith, and Carrie Fisher from Star Wars.  This one lacks the irony and the in jokes of the first two movies and has half the amount of film references. But it has enough suspence and laughs to make up for that. The direction by Wes Craven is probably his best to date. In the fun final set (in a big mansion full of secret passages), he throws some false alarms and cool camera shoots so we never know where 'Ghostface' is going to turn up next.  The creator of the first two Scream movies (Kevin Williamson) didn't get a chance to do this one so Elgar Kruger has taken over and has givin the movie some originality and great  twist that kind of changes the first movie.

It's not Hitchcock. It's not as good as the first two. The finale of the ""Scream"" movies is still as good as it could possibly be. What can you expect from a script that was being re-written everyday? I expected much less and got much more. The great thing with this ""final chapter to the trilogy"" is that it doesn't seem like a sequel. Yeah, it's tired, but it stands on its own more than the other two films. It's as if ""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" were horror movies and now ""Scream 3"" is a suspence movie. The sad thing about it is two major flaws: First, the killer gets lucky by having his victims run into the very room he's in, or the killer disappearing after being shot and someone comes in causing you to think they're the killer. Things just worked out too unrealisticly. Second, the killer fakes his death to throw off the audience watching, but why does he do it story wise? Ah, you see.
It is still a great mystery and a great acting job on Neve Campbell's part. Gale Weathers lost her nerve and is less bitchy this time, which is sad as well. But the film, over all, is as good as can be expected.",980812800,,1173,4.288288288288288

I do NOT think this movie is scary,(it is suspensful, but not scary), and I do NOT think it is as good as 'Scream'-the 1996 thriller that gave the Box-Office a '90s horror shake- , but in some ways it is better.  I enjoyed the idea of 'Stab 3' and of Sidney hiding out in the hills of Los Angeles, but it just doesn't have that wonderful, creepy, jump-to-the-edge-of-your-seat fun that 'Scream' was totally filled to the brim with! Only see 'Scream 3' if you have seen the first two (1996 & 1997), or else you will not have one CLUE WHAT IS GOING ON!  I also thought that it was kind of sad that the cameos in this film,(Jenny McCarthy, Parker Posey etc.) - are more exciting than the lead roles!

I don't want to give away the plot, as it might make the movie sound even worse than it already is in this review.

Picture quality is alright for the movie, but when it comes to the features, forget about it.

After the ""horror"" of Scream 2, Sidney becomes a recluse and lives in the woods, surrounded by security systems and comfortable in her anonymity. She is coaxed out of her exile when another ""copycat killer"" begins to murder the cast members of ""Stab 3,"" the third movie based on her story. Together with Detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) and her old sidekicks Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette), Sidney hunts down the killer and finds out the ultimate secret about her mother's past. This same secret is responsible for the nightmare that she's been living throughout the trilogy.
Kevin Williamson's writing made the first two movies tolerable, if barely. Ehren Kruger diverges greatly from Williamson's style in Scream 3, breaking the continuity of the first two scripts. Kruger does manage, however, to give a convincing conclusion to the story line of Scream 1 and 2, which is what makes this film a must-see for fans of the first two installments. While Scream 3 tries to make it hard to guess whom the killer is (""In the final act, all bets are off""), it fails in this regard, and predictability is (once again) the norm.
Related to this change in writers is the poor characterization we find in Scream 3. The sad truth is that not only are the characters introduced in the film deprived of any depth, but the characters that are the series' legacy are also denied any growth or expansion. There are no epiphanies, save for Sidney's apparent tranquility as the curtains fall, and her realization that ""it's over"" (oh please, LET IT BE OVER!).
Neve Campbell manages to use all three of her facial expressions in different enough combinations so that it isn't annoying. David Arquette and Courteney Cox Arquette work with the meager script they're given and deliver great performances for their characters, as they did in the first two films. Patrick Dempsey plays the part of Kincaid well, even though his appearances are minimal and his character is given no opportunities to develop. Parker Posey is mildly annoying, but mostly ignorable, as Jennifer Jolie (who plays Gale in ""Stab 3"").
Some special things to look for are the cameo by Jay and Silent Bob (from Dogma), a performance by the always-beautiful Jenny McCarthy, and an unexpected appearance by Randy Meeks (Jamie Kennedy), the all-knowing horror movie buff from the first film.
If you're going to get Scream 3, get it in DVD, simply because VHS will be dead in 3 years and you'll have to get it again anyway. The differences in video and audio quality alone should be enough to warrant the purchase of the DVD version.

Now the real life characters and the actors from Stab 3 must team up to fight the menace that haunts them and uncover the truth that lies hidden underneath it all.  Tori Spelling and David Schwimmer sure made a good choice to leave the Stab series after Stab 2.  This movie will blow your mind if you are a true Scream fan.  No guarantees in this one as to who will live and who will die, everyone's fair game.  So sit back and relax and have a scream of a time!",972691200,,1274,3.9960474308300395

The ease and simplicity of DVDs are what makes them like candy, but for a serious collector this is not the format for you. All the bonus selections looked a step above a MPEG that you'd download off the Internet. In some sequences you couldn't make out a character's face! And unless it's hidden, my copy did not contain the Creed music video. No loss, but I found that a little odd. And the deleted scenes they did show were none of any substance. Two additional takes on the pre-title sequence that didn't add a thing to the story or build up. And the ""alternate"" ending? It still ended the same way, they only left out Sid's ridiculous bullet-proof vest device that makes it more like an episode of Scooby-do than anything.

What makes this movie is its sheer shock value.  Guts & gore have been sacrificed for a sassy script and a thrill a minute suspense ride where everyone is a suspect.
While the original cast are there (Arquette/Campbell/Cox Arquette) and give tour de force performances as ingenu/pained victim/bitchy reporter, hats go off to duplicate performers taking the characters' role in the Stab 3 mise en abime movie, and we vigilantly observe and wonder who gets it next.
Parker Posey is absolutely sensational as Cox-Arquette's double and the pair explode on screen with sharp dialogue and physical acting which do not so much displace the horror as become a disturbing stimulant, like citrus juice on a cut.  Oh yes that powerful.

1086044,3,6305892946,"""Scream"" and ""Scream 2"" shamelessly satirized the horror movie genre in a stylish and popular fashion, but the same cannot be said for ""Scream 3,"" the final chapter in the trilogy of films. The same style and humorous fashion of the first two films is present in ""3,"" but the movie doesn't have the same element of satire. What it does have is an impressively suspenseful story with a likeable cast, even if its not as involving.
The plot is basically the same with a few new characters and situations thrown in: someone is out to find the location of Sidney Prescott, who has been in hiding for quite some time. Cotton Weary's brutal murder is a message to the fearful Sidney, who is quick to disregard it as having anything to do with her, but when people begin disappearing off the set of ""Stab 3,"" the third in a trilogy of movies about the Woodsboro murders, she begins to take notice.
And so does Gale Weathers, the news reporter who stops at nothing to get her story. She meets up with Detective Kinkaid, who uses her as a source for information. With her new legal loophole of investigation, Gale begins her investigation, running into Dewey, who is now working on the set of the now-suspicious slasher movie, as well as many other zany actors.
The mystery surrounding the murders? Photographs of Sidney's mother are being left at the scene of each crime, photos that lead our group to believe that she may have been an actress. As the clues become more clearer, Sidney will have to face her past, and an unlikely opponent who has some close ties to her.
Some pretty good material here, with fingers pointing every which way at each character. The movie ups the ante by involving more people in the plot, so that the identity of the killer will be a secret until the climax. It places Dewey on the set of the movie, along with the obviously suspicious actors, and even some of the police force come into play as possible murderers.
But, as the movie starts knocking off people one by one, the possibilities become numbered, and that's when the puzzles begin to get harder. The movie throws clues and evidence our way so many times that when the final answer hits us, it's like a brick wall because its was so blatantly obvious. It's one of those mysteries that keeps us thinking, and then has us kicking ourselves for being so blind.
But, for all its well-crafted mysteries, ""Scream 3"" doesn't have the same play on the horror genre as its sister films. The two previous outings played on all the old-school teen horror tactics used in films like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th,"" with characters spouting off dialogue about the rules of horror movies and sequels. Here, all we get is a videotape of Randy, who gives us a few rules that never leave a lasting impression. They just don't have the same effect on us here as they did before.
Even still, the closing film in the ""Scream"" trilogy is an admirable achievement, a well-crafted thriller that takes some very nice twists and turns before revealing its true colors. It doesn't live up to the first two films, but it's quite a ride!",968198400,,3096,4.590252707581228

I will admit that I jumped, bit my nails, and (only once) I actually screamed during this film.  It is fairly scary (although the whole idea and characters of ""Scream"" are starting to get old).

1086048,2,6305892946,"Wes Craven did the same with the Nightmare on Elm Street Series.
The  first one is always great, with a sinister plot, or a creepy bad guy or an  interesting plot, but then Craven starts seeing greenbacks and the now  series loses it's edge and becomes a cash franchise, rather than a good  pieces of celluloid.  It's the same with Scream.  The first one was  excellent in it's way of satirizing other scary movies (including Nightmare  on Elm street) by devising a set of ""rules"" that one must follow  to survive a horror movie.
However the second fell into the generic  slasher movie flick and this one was even worse.
Sydney Prescott is now  in hiding, working as a phone counselor for distressed people.  She's  leading a sheltered, protective life (An alarm detector on a 4 foot high  fence?  Give me a BREAK!) and is in a location no one knows about.
Meanwhile, Stab 3 is in production and the first character to die  (Cotton Weary from Scream 2) is killed in real life by another copy cat.  Holy deja vu Batman!  He begins killing other characters in the order of  their deaths in the movie and ultimately, after the second death, the  production is shut down.
The killer wants Sydney to come out of hiding  and face him/her for past misdeeds which includes Sydney's promiscious  mother.
The movie is composed of people and their acting doubles  sarcastically making fun of each other and this ranting gets old very  quickly.  The problem is, there is no other dialog to replace this.  Obviously Kevin Williamson has run out of creative things to do or say.  The killer becomes the typical omnipotent character who is everywhere and  knows everything.  He begins killing the cast members for no reason (other  than having another Craven gimmick) with them having no chance.  So this is  just another typical movie right?  Yeah, but Craven/Williamson should know  better by now.  It is pretty sad for them to end (yeah right) this trilogy  this way, with the main character who becomes not a person, but a  runner/screamer/scared face person, the others becoming meat for the  grinder and secondary comic relief having no chemistry with the secondary  female (and their married in real life!).

  The story is about Sidney Prescott,  who now goes by another name.  Her life is okay, but someone begins to  stalk her once again in a deadly game of cat and mouse.  Meanwhile, a movie  called Stab 3 is in production.  Before the movie is finished, a murderer  begins to stalk the ones involved in the movie one by one.

  Gale Wethers, who is now a  major celebrity, teams with Dewwy to catch the cunning killer.  As they get  closer and closer to the truth, they realize that Sidney has a connection  to the carnage, and she may be the next victim.

1086100,4,6305892946,"Wes Craven has produced another entertaining, high budget horror movie in the third of what is now a trilogy.  The film professes an end to the  sequels, but at $100 million average box office per movie, frankly I'm  skeptical.  The first three ""Friday the 13th"" movies didn't gross $100  million between them, and now twenty years later, they are producing number  ten.
This film didn't traverse any new ground, continuing from ""Scream 2""  with the movie within a movie concept.  Though Craven still presents a  droll and effective story, he has stopped innovating.  He simply continues  to present us with good but jaded themes.
It seems the gore has been  toned down for this film, which is probably not a bad thing.  The story  answered all sorts of questions about the first film that no one had.  I  suppose they needed to create questions so they could make a movie to  answer them.  I didn't find Ehren Kruger's writing to be up to the standard  set by Kevin Williamson.  Williamson's humor was much more sophisticated  and astute whereas Kruger settled for low brow sarcastic sniping and tongue  in cheek humor.
The whole cast delivered a collectively enjoyable  performance, although with the paranoid and overwrought way that Sidney was  written, Neve Campbell couldn't have had much fun.  Courtney Cox was funny  and flaky as ever as Gale Weathers as was hubby David Arquette.  The rest  of the ensemble including Patrick Dempsey, Emily Mortimer, Liev Schreiber,  Scott Foley, Parker Posey and a host of other victims all did a terrific  job.
I enjoyed this slightly more than Scream 2, but much less than the  original.  I rated it a 7/10.  Craven's once fresh approach to horror is  still good, but it is starting to get threadbare.  If there is going to be  a fourth installment in the trilogy (would that be a quadology?), Craven  needs to get creative again and take the genre to the next level or risk  running out of gas.",965433600,,1940,4.7492447129909365
1086151,5,6305892946,"It's literally impossible to express in 1000 words or less how good Scream  3 is.  But I'll try my best.  Here goes...
Sidney Prescott (Neve  Campbell), after surviving The Windsor College murders a few years ago is  now living in quiet seclusion in the picturesque mountains, far far away  from any knife wielding psychopath with a ghost mask...or even her old  friends.  In fact, she has no friends--the only person she talks to is her  father and she has Dewey Riley's phone number just in case.  Meanwhile,  down in Hollywood Roman Bridger (Scott Foley) and John Milton (Lance  Henriksen) are making STAB 3: Return to Woodsboro, the final chapter in the  STAB trilogy.  But when it's cast members begin to get knocked off one by  one in the order their characters die in the script the movie is shut down.  With actors out of work only one question remains--who's doing this..and  why?  Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette) and Dewey Riley (David  Arquette) are also back to help out Detective Mark Kincaid (Patrick  Dempsey) to help out with the case.  When Sidney is drawn out of hiding to  do some helping of her own and try yo lessen the body count all hell breaks  loose all the way down to the inevitable showdown and unmasking of the  killer/s and what a surprise it is!!
Screenwriter Ehren Kruger (Arlington  Road) and director Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street) have done a  wonderful job in scaring their audience half to death and then making them  laugh until another scream erupts.  The score is great, the cinematography  is excellent, the acting is top notch, it's so funny...should I go on?  Oh  yeah, one more thing--the extras on this DVD include Outtakes which are  quiet frankly hilarious, Deleted scenes--ummm yummy!!  Creed's What If  music video is great as is an Alternate Ending and best of all...Audio  Commentary with Wes Craven, Patrick Lussier (the editor) and Marriane  Maddalena (one of the producers).
Get out there and buy this DVD  now...you WON'T REGRET IT!!!",965088000,,2004,4.822485207100592

1086154,5,6305892946,"The most terrifying scream is always the last one, or so ""Scream 3""proclaims. Surprisingly enough though, the ending to Kevin Williamson's clever trilogy doesn't let viewers down-- even without Williamson scripting  the final chapter.  From the opening scene fans of ""Scream"" and ""Scream  2"" will be shocked and pleasantly surprised at who lives and who dies. And  although the ending is your typical cheesy horror film conclusion, it fits  ""Scream"" perfectly. After all, this wasn't just any old horror franchise.  This horror series cleverly made fun of its own genre and trilogies while  scripting together an engaging and intriguing plotline that kept viewers  guessing to, appropriately enough, the very last scream. Written by Ehren  Kruger, ""Scream 3"" is the perfect ending to the horror franchise that  brought back scary movies in the `90s. Clever, funny and suspenseful,  ""Scream 3"" leaves the rules that ex-Scream star Jamie Kennedy clued viewers  in on in the original ""Scream"" at the door.  Neve Campbell, David  Arquette, and Courtney Cox-Arquette return for the final chapter of the  ""Scream"" series, but this film is Arquette and Cox-Arquette's alone. While  viewers should care about Campbell's character and whether or not she  lives, viewers will be cheering for the ruthless TV reporter Gail Weathers  and the dopey Deputy Dewey the whole time. Hopeless romantics will also get  caught up in whether or not the two on-again off-again, real-life duo will  end up happily ever after like they did in real life.  As though the  film wasn't great enough in the theater, the DVD just adds to the whole  ""Scream"" experience, giving away not only the alternate trilogy ending, but  also giving fans a chance to see deleted scenes and out-takes from all  three ""Scream"" films. Additional DVD features include the Creed ""What If""  music video, theatrical trailers, and commentary by horror master Wes  Craven.  So sit back with a friend or loved one, turn off the lights,  and get ready to laugh and scream one final time. You won't be  disappointed.",964828800,,2061,5.102102102102102

Scream 3, on the other hand, takes all the movie cliches that were intelligently avoided in the first  two films and crams them into 2 hours of nonsense. The characters here are  so stupid I actually wanted them to die. I mean, if you and a friend were  in a huge mansion in which a killer is on the loose, would you split up and  would you each go in a separate direction? I didn't think so...

This ""Final Act"" is not as good as it's two  predecessors but it is still an average finish to a good trilogy. In my  opinion the first ""Scream"" was the best and the following films  did not live up to the first film.  I think that ""Sream3"" was not  as good as the others because it was not as original as the first film and  everyone was comparing it to that because ""Scream"" re-defined  teen-slasher films.

1086184,4,6305892946,"Williamson's style may be missing, but it is not entirely missed. Instead Scream 3 is scripted by Ehren Kruger, who brought us Arlington Road.  Scream 3 has all the main survivors and a cameo by Randy via videotape,  which is a welcome one.  Stab 3 is the movie that is in production in  Scream 3 with all the characters meeting their counterparts.  The  interaction between Courtney Cox, who plays the ""real"" Gale  Weathers, and Parker Posey, who plays Gale Weathers in Stab 3, is always  funny and refreshing.  Parker Posey is highly energetic and seems to be  having a great time making the movie.
Anyway, after a couple murders  everyone realizes the people are dying in order that they were to die in  the script of Stab 3.  Unfortunately, four scripts were created and no one  is sure which one the killer is following.  Shortly after, the killer  decides to create his own script to keep them guessing.  Scream 3 does not  have much in the way of scares and can be predictable, but it is still a  welcome end to the trilogy.  GRADE: B
-""Here's how I see it: I've  got no house, no bodyguard, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants  to kill me? No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I  go where you go.

1086185,2,6305892946,"Ok.. let me lay this down for you
Scream 1- Great... orginal, funny, suspenseful and one of the best movie twist in the past decade.
Scream 2- Not bad... Being released after movies like Urban Legend, I know what you  did... this movie takes second chair to teh genre. Its hard to scare people  once again with the same old tricks. Ending had somewhat of a nice twist.  Saddened by the loss of Randy.
Scream 3- Not good... OK i will give them  some points here. One, i like the fact that they gave the killer more of a  variety of killing methods.. the chasing with the knife is old. Two, It was  nice to see that people in this movie are using those things you hear so  muc habout...what are they called..OH YEAH guns. Three, I liked the idea of  the voice changer but the conception that someone could get a hold of  something like that or that something like that could exist at all is  stupid. Me being a audio editor can tell you that for that to work it would  have to be Scream 3000. and Four, i enjoyed the jay and silent bob  part.
But the ending was stupid as all hell. For a killer premise to work  as shocking you have to build up something with that. The first killers  were great... you loved them.. you were shocked that it was them. The  seconds killers, yes one being very predictable, but the second a nice  added touch. You see so little of the killer out of mask in this movie that  when he takes of the mask you go. ""Who that hell is this looser""  Then the story behind him just seems to pop out of mid-air.
I have to  give the Scream movies something. They remain a constant. Getting worse as  they go on. I am gald that there will be no more. Its a disgrace to the  first movie to have such bad sequels.
I am sorry i have yet to see a  scary slasher film in my entire life. There is a difference between scared  and shocked. And Scream one was the only one to shock me.",963964800,,1892,4.123287671232877
1086186,3,6305892946,"Enough already! I will admit that I loved the original ""Scream"" and I was interested in ""Scream 2"" to see what happened next, but ""Scream 3""? I think I wasted my time. I know that I am probably in the minority here, but I  think that everything that the original movie did to restore the slasher  film to its glory this movie undid.
The opening scene does reach out a  grab you, and gets the action rolling, but eventually you find yourself  hoping these characters would die a little faster. The three remaining main  characters once again find themselves the target of a serial killer. Only  this time it is obvious that the writers were straining to come up with a  reason for this killer to terrorize his victims, (oh by the way, several  years ago...this happened...and then...) and when you do finally get the climax  of the picture, it is a major disappointment.
The action takes place in  Hollywood, as each of the cast members (inlcuding Jenny McCarthy) in the  ""Stab 3"" (the movie within the movie) begin to tun up dead; murdered by a  sadistic killer that leaves messages for the police in the form of old  photographs of Sidney Prescott's dead mother. Dewey (David Arquette), Gale  (Courtney Cox) and Sidney (Neve Campbell) start to help the police track  down this killer. I guess the problem I have with this film is this:
In  the first film we established the ""rules"" for a horror movie, but in this  film everyone seems to have forgotten them. Sidney walks onto a dark movie  set alone, knowing that a murder has already been committed there.  Characters wonder off into a large dark mansion and decide to split up. We  see people who should know better say things like ""Wait here."" Or ""I'll be  right back."" Then out of the blue Randy the video store geek who died in  ""Scream 2"" shows up in the form of a video he recorded before he died, just  in case the gang ever came up against a killer a third time and needed his  help. Excuse me! How stupid are we supposed to be!  Although his little  monologue is hilarious, it is so totally unbelievable that I have trouble  coming up with the right words.
Wes Craven also returns to direct and  does a decent job directing some very good actors in a very bad script.  There were none of the ""Man I didn't see that coming!"" moments in this  movie, and that's what I have come to expect from the ""Scream"" series.  Personally I saw the ending coming a mile away. I didn't get the person  right, but I nailed the circumstances leading up to it all. It's not that  I'm that smart, but trust me you don't have to be a genius to figure this  lame plot twist out. One of the few bright spots is Parker Posey. She plays  the ""Stab 3"" version of Gale Weathers and is absolutely hilarious playing  her to the hilt. There is also a very brief cameo by Carrie Fisher that is  mildly amusing. Over all the movie was huge disappointment, and had it not  been for the outtakes and deleted scenes on the DVD I would have really  felt cheated.
Given the state of the Scream plot line, I guess there was  only so much you could do with, but making a movie for the sake of making a  movie is not the way to go. And it really is a shame, because they could  have done some great things with the cast they assembled. If you need this  movie to complete the trilogy, then by all means buy it.

The killer is everywhere, seemingly able to move faster than the speed of light  and the victims seem to be magnetically drawn to their demises by the sheer  stupidity of their actions.(Got that) In other words the killings seem more  than ever to be written to occur at a certain time instead of being in any  way a surprise.(The killings are very predictable) The standard  ""Scream"" plot twists are thrown at you like eggs on Halloween  night.(If you are into that sort of mischief) The confusion mounts as many  details are brought to the surface that in the other movies were never  mentioned. The ending is a total surprise and seems to come waaaaaay out of  left field. I thought the whole way the trilogy of ""Scream"" came  to an end seemed like it was made up during the later stages of the making  of ""Scream 3"". It's one thing to have a surprise ending and its  another thing to just make one up that sounds surprising because it has  nothing to do with what actually happened previously.

1086204,3,6305892946,"The words of Sidney Prescott's mom ring throughout this, the final chapter in the Scream Trilogy.  Her spectre provides a creepy visage previously missing from the series.  This is not to say it is altogether congruent  with the rest of the tale.  Scream was never about ghosts.  Maureen  Prescott's appearrance in the final chapter should have been limited to  video footage if new screenwriter wanted it to make perfect sense.  Otherwise, the movie is a serviceable, if not altogether surprising end to  the story.  There are several thrilling scenes excellently executed through  Craven's direction, but there is a lot more down time in Scream 3 than you  would expect in a movie of its kind.  The cast, except a remarkably  well-cast Patrick Dempsy, acts like they are sleepwalking through the  movie.  Lance Henriksen was a terrible choice for a movie executive.  I  just can't see Frank Black falling prey to a whiney punk of a killer.  And  what in the heck does Sidney Prescott's dad do that he can't hang around to  see if his frequently stalked daughter is alright, anyway?  Krugher does  his best, but he is not Williamson, and it shows.  Craven should not have  made this movie without him.
Another bone of contention is with the DVD  packaging and advertising proclaiming that this movie has an additional  commentary track with Wes and the Production team, along with Cast &  Crew bios and the Creed music video.  Nothing doing.  They have alternate  takes, deleted scenes and a montage of the making of the series (the former  two with commentary), but that is it.  Then again, mine could be an error.

1086205,4,6305892946,"Scream 3 is the final film of the Scream Trilogy. In Scream 3, Sidney Prescott (played by Neve Campbell) realizes that another killer is stalking her when cast members of ""Stab 3: Return to Woodsborro"" start to get  killed. She decides to keep hidden in her well protected home in the  mountains, until the killer finds out her hiding place. She then goes to  Hollywood, where all the murders are happening, to face the killer. Gale  Weathers (Courtney Cox Arquette) and Dwight ""Dewey"" Riley (David Arquette)  have their usual love fling, and they both investigate the murders and the  photos that the killer leaves behind after each murder to try to find out  who the killer is.  So far, the Scream series has been a ""slash-`em-up""  series with lots of scares and gore. Scream 3 is much different than the  other two. Scream 3 is more of a thriller with a ""whodunit"" plot. Scream 3  definitely doesn't have as many intense murder scenes, and a lot less blood  than the other two. The movie ends in a twist that you probably never would  have thought of.  Scream 3 is rated ""R"" because of profanity, gore, and  violence that may be inappropriate or offensive to young audiences and  people who get offended by such matter.  Scream 3 is mainly based on  events that were in the first Scream, so I advise you watch the first two  movies of the trilogy before you go see the third one, otherwise you would  be lost. If you saw the first two movies of the trilogy, I suggest you go  see Scream 3. It links the events of the other two movies together and  makes the whole trilogy make some kind of sense.

1086206,3,6305892946,"I'll give this movie 3 stars because there is some merit to the film.  But, the original screenwriter (Kevin Williamson) would have done a much better job.  Instead of taking us on a thrillride of the horror genre, this  new screenwriter walks us through the plotlines of the first two flicks.  The help video from Randy in the middle of the movie made no sense.  It's  important to make a great movie, not a great sequel, which is what I felt  the writer was trying to do.  There is a difference, and it was painfully  obvious in this film.  Many of the scenes were mediocre at best and did not  set up a suspenseful thread like the first two flicks.  I wish they would  not have done the film at all unless Kevin Williamson wrote it (I guess the  initial outline--which he submitted at the same time as his original  ""Scream"" screenplay to the studio--was not enough to carry the  movie; maybe the producers thought it would have, but if so then they were  way wrong).  One good thing about the movie: an appearance by ""Silent  Bob.""  I don't think many people knew who he was when I saw this movie  in the theater (he's a character from films like ""Mallrats"" and  ""Clerks""--if you haven't seen those, well, you should see them  right away--they are really funny movies).",963100800,,1273,4.4868421052631575
1086207,3,6305892946,"Scream what a series of films.  It all started out as probably one of the best modern horror film series and ends on a kind of downer.  With the absence of Kevin Williamson's writing talents this film has a strong lack  of scares and suspense.  As a HUGE horror film fan I found this film quite  dry.  What made the first two films great was an enormous amount of scares,  wit, and originality that brought the films into a new generation.  But  like most horror film series the goods have to end sometime.  Much like  Halloween or Friday the 13th, if the sequels had been kept to a minimum  they would have become immortal.  Where Scream 3 is concerned it simply  offered up nothing new to really be scared by, such as Drew Barrymore's  opening phone conversation in Scream or the scene in Scream 2 where Sidney  has to crawl over the killer to escape a wrecked car.
This film opens  with Liev Schreiber's chilling death where the killer seeks info on the  whereabouts of the now hiding Sidny Prescot (played very well by Cambell  again) and leads the viewer into a false sense of things to come.  The  murders continue to plague the set of the new horror film ""Stab 3"".  In the  name of that movie inside a movie title is the first inaccuracy.  Wouldn't  it or shouldn't it have been ""Stab 2""?  Even after the grisly death of  Schreiber's character, Cotton, the production goes on on the new Stab film  leading to the untimely deaths of several other cast members.  Returning  again are Cox and Arquette reprising their roles of Gale Weathers and Dewy.  Perhaps the best part of the film and sadly little used was the meeting of  the real characters and the Hollywood characters, the best example of this  being that of Cox and Posey who really seemed to work well with each other.  During the course of the story Sidny has visions of her mother being  murdered which would have been a nice effect had it been done just a little  better.  I won't go into detail of what the rest of the story was about  because it may for some give away the end.  The end I found to be  unexpected that is to say who the killer was, but I was disappointed to see  that they went there.  There was also a lot of hype whether or not Sidny  gets killed in this one or not.  You'll have to see it because I won't tell  you but some may be disappointed.  Over all not a bad film but could have  been better, it is worth seeing and I have to say a fun ride. Nice little  cameo by Henrekson.
Now for the DVD review.  This was actually a great  DVD presentation of this film it offered up a lot of extras.  The picture  and sound quality was very good and the over all presentation was  excellent.  The alternate ending that is advertised wasn't all that  different, I guess I had my hopes up for something different.  But needless  to say this is how a DVD should be done, loads of features and cool  presentation.  The one downside is the listed price...just a little too high.",963014400,,2956,4.337016574585635

1086235,5,6305892946,"THERE ARE NO SPOLIERS IN THIS REVIEW!
There's really only one word to describe Scream 3 and that is ""wow""!  I was one of the first to see this movie in Ireland.  I was already a fan of the first two.  Contrary  to what most people say I think Scream 2 was better than the first chapter.  I knew this one would be even better--and it was without a doubt for MANY  reasons.  Firstly, Ehren Kruger wrote the screenplay.  I remember seeing  Arlington Road and saying to myself ""God, if Kevin was to drop off  writing duties on Scream 3 then this is the man to take over"" and I  have to say the Weinstein Brothers couldn't have made a better choice.  Kevin Williamson is my favorite screenwriter (Tarantino second and Kruger  third) but I don't think that even Kevin Williamson would have brought the  originality to this final chpater like Ehren did.  The whole style of the  movie was different yet familiar and in that way it allows the audience to  remember it's watching a Scream movie without saying ""Hey, I've seen  that before.""  The whole voice distortion thing was ingenious and the  opening scene was the best ever!  OH MY GOD.  Who would have guessed?  And  it was sooooo suspenseful and well done that my jaw was on the cinema  floor.  Everything is either scary, thrilling, controverisl or funny all  the way down to the inevitable blood-sluiced-slide down to the unmasking.  As Ehren Kruger said himself--it is a little like Scooby Doo (but in the  fun way).  The cinematography was top-notch (great colors, framing and of  course those famous hint-hints to the audience where the camera favors a  certain character and immediatley makes him/her a suspect.)  The DP Peter  Deming and Editor Patrick Lussier worked well together and I think their  work is fantastic, especially on this film.  The pacing was well-maintained  (another Kruger touch which is evident in his films) and keeps you guessing  about the identity of the killers until the very end.  And it's NOT just  one of those He/She/They-takes-of-the-mask-and-gives-any-ol' motive.  The  ending not only relates to Scream 3 but also to the first movie.  When the  killer(s) is/are finally revealed you say to yourself ""Wow.  That's  smart.""  Craven, Kruger, Maddelena, Williamson and Co. couldn't have  done a better job.  The score is frightening to say the least and the  characters are well cast and developed and are very very very very funny  especially Jennifer's character (Parker Posey) and Tyson Fox (Deon  Richmond) and Jennifer's bodyguard Steven Stone manages to raise a FEW  healthy laughs every time he pops up on screen.  Patrick Dempsey's  character Detective Mark Kincaid (cool name) is superb as the detective who  takes over the Stab 3 case and the chemistry that takes place between  Campbell and him is electric (especially in a scene in his office where he  talks to Sidney about her mother and both their lives).  Kincaid's partner  J. Wallace is like a light version of Chandler Bing who is relaxed as hell  and so sarcastic he's funny.  Liev Schreiber (I love this man) is a welcome  addition to the cast, returning as Cotton Weary, the man who was once  framed for the murder of Maureen Prescott (Sidney's mother) in Scream but  was later exonerated.  Cotton is now the host of the country's ""No. 1  nationally syndicated talk-show"" and has a beautiful girlfriend  Christine (Kelly Rutherford from Melrose Place) who is never quiet sure  whether she can trust Cotton or not.  Parker Posey is hilarious as the  actress Jennifer Jolie who portrays Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox Arquette)  in STAB 3.  And Dewey Riley (David Arquette) returns as the technical  advisor on the set of STAB 3 and also happens to be Jennifer's boyfriend  which Gale is not so happy about.  This love triangle gives rise to some  hilarious and unforgettable movie moments.  Jenny Mc Carthy is also great  (for a change) as Sarah Darling, who's just an actress in STAB 3.  Sarah's  scenes are like a story on its own.  It's like a look into an actresses  life in Hollywood and how they're typecast immediately.  Luckily for  McCarthy, she was able to break free of being typecast and shows that she  can in fact act.  Emily Mortimer is great as Angelina Tyler, the  ""young, sweet, ingenue"" who plays Sidney in STAB 3 and Matthew  Keeslar is fantastic as Tom Prinze, the actor who plays Dewey as is Scott  Foley's character Roman Bridger (I'll probably change my name to this) as  the director of Stab 3: Return To Woodsboro who is paranoid about his film  being ""killed"" and his neurosis about it is funny too.  When the  characters who play other characters in Stab 3 meet up the result is  instantaneously hilarious.  This also provides extra space for Kruger to  point the finger of suspicion at EVERY character (this is not an  understatement).  But don't be fooled by the well-meaning demeanor of most  characters.  You need to look beyond the facade of most characters to see  the truth (Kruger is a master of this).  Oh, I almost forgot, the cameos.  Randy Meeks, who died in Scream 2 is back.  How?  His sister Martha  (Heather Matarazzo) brings Sidney, Gale and Dewey a video of Randy  explaining the rules of the trilogy which he made before he died.  All will  be revealed when you watch the movie.  It's NOT predictable either--far  from it.  I loved the ending especially.  I don't want to say much about  the killer(s) motives so I'll move onto the last sequence in the movie  which was so well done that I'm jealous of Craven's talent.  If you don't  BUY this film then you're simply a fool.  Yes, a FOOL--because this is  without a doubt not only the best horror film of all time but is a worthy  entry into any film fan's Top Ten...or even Top Five Best Movies Of All  Time.  I saw it 8 times in the cinema and have it ordered from Amazon.com  on DVD and will receive it next week (great service) and you can bet your  bottom dollar (or pound in my case) that I will be waiting to attack the  postman before he hops off his bike.  Can't wait to see it again..and  again..and again...and again and I'm not crazy by the way.",962841600,,6111,4.688212927756654
1086236,3,6305892946,"I am sorry to say that I was really disappointed that this movie did not deliver.  The plot could've worked well if the actors could've worked with it.  Their performances were just so campy!  This movie could have been  much better but it just seemed like the actors were not interested in their  parts.  Except for maybe Parker Posey.  Courtney Cox & David Arquette  seemed bored.  As for Neve Campbell - it doesn't look like she wanted to do  this movie.  I don't blame her one bit given her castmates'  performances.
I really enjoyed Scream & thought that Scream 2 was  pretty good as well.  I was actually looking forward to seeing Scream 3.  But to no avail.
The only reason this DVD gets three stars is because of  all of the extras on it.  Bloopers, Deleted Scenes, Lots of extras - I  actually haven't had a chance to go through all of them yet.  Movie rates a  2.  DVD rates a 4.

I've always been a fan of horror movies but let's face the fact that horror movies today are trash, except for Scream.  Whoa, what a great conclusion to a trilogy! Scream 3 has some surprises for  the viewer. The killer (or killers) doesn't play by the rules, which is not  a good thing for Sidney (Neve Campbell), Dewey (David Arquette) and Gale  (Courteney Cox). Sidney hides in the woods, but then she decides to face  the music. There are some phat twists and turns in the film, and it is  chillingly fun. The actors were great, especially Campbell. But I enjoyed  Parker Posey's portrayal of the actress who plays Gale Weathers in Stab 3;  she's hilarious. Anyway, this film concludes a very impressive trilogy. To  be honest, I don't like teen-slasher films, but this film is too clever to  resist. I highly recommend it!

I won't spoil the ending even though I would like to so I  can explain my disgust with it:) Oh well, the dvd is cool none the less(my  local circuit city screwed up and put it on sale a week early) The picture  and sound are great and they finally release a scream movie with some  decent extras. This movie is worth a look due to the fact that it does end  the popular trilogy(or so they say I already have heard about a scream 4  with a new cast) The fact is that these movies make money and they will  make them forever until they don't. I would give this a C- because of its  disappointing ending and the terrible actress Parker Posey. I have seen  other movies by her and she isn't bad there but here she is awful.

Scream3 is deffinately an important addition to the previous 2,not  only 'cause it provides the final chapter of the series but because it  is,on it's own, a great movie. It is very different from the other two as  far as character is concerned:it is darker,moody and very post  modern-ish.

Neve is really  good,Potsy is really funny and in general all seem to fit in nicely with  the movie(although Cox looks like a dag,but still delivers the  thrills).Part 3 is also more comic than scary,but Scream was never a true  horror film,nor did it ever try to be one.

Of course, Scream 1 gets major points for being revolutionary, which is  always tough to follow, but the third installment does it quite well.  Its  hall of mirrors plot (is it a movie or is it real life?) keeps you guessing  until the end when it finally topples over with ridiculousness.  However,  when the credits roll, hopefully you'll forget about the holes you found as  the conclusion was unraveling and remember the thrilling ride you just  experienced.  Neve Campbell is at the top of her game here with an  expressive and deeply affecting performance.  The rest of the cast are also  competent players, with Parker Posey being the hilarious standout.

1086373,5,6305892946,"Scream 3....the final act? or is it?  We are still kept guessing
  This trilogy, a true trilogy, is one of the best and definitley the best HORROR trilogy EVER!  All characters and actors in these films were  perfect for the roles they played.  The only question is -- Freddy or  Ghostface (who's better)
Wes Craven while with Freddy tickled our dreams  and fantasy parts of our mind.  With The SCREAM TRILOGY he puts reality  into the horror genre.  Scream is great because EVERYONE can relate to  watching scary movies, having friends or loved-ones killing people, and  being AFRAID when you're alone.
All the Cast: Neve Campbell, Courtney  Cox, David Arquette, Skeet Ulrich, Matthew Lillard, Rose McGowan, W. Earl  Brown, Liev Schreiber, Jenny McCarthy, Parker Posey, Patrick Dempsey, Henry  Winkler, Laurie Metcalf, Jada Pinkett, Omar Epps, Drew Barrymore, and my  favorite Jamie Kennedy ARE FANTASTIC---LOVE THEM ALL!",960681600,8,922,5.205479452054795
1086374,4,6305892946,"The point I think most critics seem to be missing about 'Scream 3' is that it IS the third movie of the trilogy, and so it is almost impossible to keep up the same level of freshness and originality. So that's a given. And  yet, at the same time, the final installment managed to be laugh-out-loud  funny and built up to a really suspenseful, and well-crafted finale. Yes,  Sidney's role was nothing more than basically a cameo appearance but the  new character of Parker Posey carried the movie all on her own with such an  amazingly witty, over-the-top performance. The script was as fresh as they  could have made it considering that this is their third effort, and while I  found the revelation of the killer somewhat disappointing (I had so hoped  it would have been one of the returning members from either of the first  two movies - notably Sidney's father - which would have made more sense) it  was still a well-made ending, and the final ""epilogue"", with  Sidney leaving an 'open door', literally, was the perfect final image, and  Wes Craven gave such brilliant irony - and a fitting conclusion - with this  final shot. Supporting players were nothing more than cardboard cutouts  (and what is up with Deon Richmond's character? totally expendable) yet at  the same time the death scenes (except for that of Jenny McCarthy) were  suspenseful and had just enough energy to keep us on the edge of our seats.
Oh, and yeah, the 'voice changer' was a cool little device that added  some creative edge to the killer's techniques this time around.",960508800,,1551,4.70631970260223
1086375,5,6305892946,"With every other horror trilogy i've seen, the first is okay, the second, gets worse, and by the third i forget why I ever took the time to watch any of them.  Scream 3 is different.  It is every bit as scary as the first  two, if not more and was definetly more funny.  Its probably my favorite of  the three, although the ending was kinda stupid, only the very ending.  I  have seen the collectors edition of Scream 1 with the director and writers  commentary and it was very interesting.  I only wish I had been more  careful and bought the collectors edition of the second.",960422400,,577,4.308411214953271

1086377,5,6305892946,"""*RING RING*. Hello"" Thus starts the Scream trilogy, in the classic fatal phonecall scene.  All of these movies are well thought out, have good characters and actors, and are very scary.  The first movie is a  great and classic movie with great performences by Neve Cambell(Sydny),  Skeet Ulrich (Billy), and the best by Mattew Lillard(Stu).  The sceond was  a disapointment.  The story was terrible, the script was ok, although I  loved how they introduced Cotton.  The third one is the best of all.  The  killer is great, it has plenty of twists and turns, and I thought it was  great how they introduced the ghost factor (with Sydny's mother).  If you  haven't seen this movie already, I very highly recomend it (as well as the  other screams).  I gave it a very well deserved five stars.",960163200,,791,4.705882352941177
1086378,4,6305892946,"Williamson's writing and the character of Randy are missed, but is still a great conclusion to the trilogy.  I enjoy this film better than the 2nd and close to the 1st.  The reason this film is so good is because it's  different from the first two. Slasher films from the past were always the  same in every sequel, but this film dares to be different and does it well.  I really didn't want to see a Scream 2 all over again, so I was pleased  with what I saw.  The top 5 reasons I liked the 3rd better than 2 are 1:  Neve gives the best performance of all three. 2: darker than the second. 3:  better ending (closed area and I didn't know who the killer(s) was/were. 4:  More mystery. 5: More suspense rather than gore (unlike the second).  Please order this film now!",960076800,2,769,4.23448275862069
1086379,4,6305892946,"When Scream came out and I saw it in theatres, I loved it.  The characters  were good and well rendered, and the script was both funny and thrilling.  When the sequel came out, I had believed that no sequel could surpass the  original, but Scream 2 proved me wrong.  Therefore, I figured that Scream 3  would triple the fun and thrills.  It didn't.
The movie was shockingly  unoriginal.  Though the main characters were good, the fallback characters  were paper-thin, with no personality at all (excluding Parker Posey, who  was great).  You didn't care when the killer popped out and slit their  throat, because you really didn't know them like you knew the characters in  the last two.
Also, there were really no 'good and thrilling' scenes.  The postmodern killer-jumping-out-of-a-dark-corner stuff and then BAM!  someone is dead just didn't work.  Where were the good Kevin Williamson  suspense scenes, like the car scene or the soundstage scene in Scream  2?
But, you see that I have given the movie four stars.  This is because  of the ending, which makes up totally for the rest of the movie.  As soon  as Sid is called at the police station and arrives at the mansion, all hell  breaks loose and you are launched on a twenty-minute-long roller coaster.  EXCELLENT ENDING, better than the previous two movies' endings.  It was  original, suspenseful, had a bomb fight scene b/w Sid and the killer, threw  in some twists, and resolved in a way that wasn't corny.  Believe it or  not, that twenty minutes saved this film and made it worth the money.",959904000,,1554,4.776515151515151
1086380,4,6305892946,"I am a big fan of the Scream series but this final  installment was way over the top even for my standards.  It came together nicely but it felt forced.  I wasn't sure if I liked all the humor that was injected this time  around. Several plots and lots of characters added to the confusion. I  loved Parker Posey in the Gale role and enjoyed many moments in the movie,  including the interior sound stage sets of Woodsboro were Sydney is chased  by the killer!  A great surprise ending  left me satisfied and surprised.  This movie did very well without Kevin Williamson's script so enough of  that issue!  ........and what's up with Courteney Cox's hair and  jewelry!  Yikes!  Gale really looked horrible in this last installment  (We think? ). One suggestion for you honey:  McDonald's, McDonald's, and  more McDonald's!

1086382,3,6305892946,"The statement in the title is true and that's why I'll rate this movie so highly, 'cause actually there isn't much to rate. If some of you saw Urban Legend (1998) shortly after Scream2 came out then you know what I'm talking  about. That movie was almost good for nothing (except some better lines and  scenes) - just a rip-off of Screams. Scr3am goes on the same road.
The  dialogue is forced, jokes are bad and more like awful puns, you never gonna  guess who the killer is cause there's nothing to guess, etc. It hasn't got  the virtues of the first two parts of the trilogy and mostly it is because  Kevin Williamson droped out.
Ok, this was a little bit harsh; there are  good things in this movie too. Campbell, Cox and Arquette are as good as  they used to be (except Courtney's hairdo) and Liev Schreiber does a good  perfomance as Cotton (still the same hilariously freaky style as in  Scream2). Some memorable scenes and Wes Craven's amazing camera work.
Overall: To those who haven't seen previous parts it should be a big  event, to the real Scream fans it's just the conclusion (although, some  plot-lines are unfinished). The movie is good, but n&oacute;t as good as you'd  expect from a movie named Scream.  And definitely not a scary movie!",959731200,,1256,4.573991031390134
1086559,4,6305892946,"I had my doubts about seeing Scream 3.  To my surprise it was very entertaining.  The reason I like this sequel more than the second, was Scream 3 had more of the tone the first did.  Scream 2 was to dark and  there was no satire in number 2.  Scream 3 is funny,scary,and will leave  you wanting more.  Their is one catch, make sure you see number 1 to  understand the back story of Scream 3.",959558400,,392,4.065789473684211

This brings back the  comedic Horrer that made scream such a big box office smash, and of coarse  more of that trademark poking fun of the horrer genre that we all love,  trust me this is ""A Scream baby!""
It is set around the set of  ""Stab 3"" The only one of the stab films not based on real life or  a book written By Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox, Scream 1 & 2 and  Friends). But someone wants to make his own sequal and ofcoarse its up to  our beloved heroine (Neve Campbell Scream 1 & 2, Party of Five) to  track down the killer/s but not without a little help from her buddies Gale  and Dewey (David Arquette Scream 1 & 2).  there are Some great Scream  New comers introduced in this film, probably the most memorable being  Parker Posey Playing the Hilarious Jeniffer Jolie theres also Patrick  Dempsey, Jenny McCarthy and Felicity's Scott Foley. Also Liev Schreiber and  Jamie Kennedy make small but Awsome Cameos. Believe me this movies got it  all and all i can say is that it's all over and it goes of with a  bang!

1086561,5,6305892946,"Wow! What can I say? The Scream movies actually have a good plot/story, so that makes them superior to most horror movies to start with - if you can call them horror. Excellent how they brought up new stuff that actually  fitted in with the other two movies, but totally changing them. Not like  those movies where they say something happened, but they showed you  something entirely different. The plot actually thickens and gets better.  Scary, funny, VERY entertaining.

1086562,4,6305892946,"Hello Sidney... Wes Craven is the mastermind behind the Scream series. He directs his films with great style which relates to the viewers' different moods. The original was greater than the sequel but the third has overtaken  the first. Although most of the jumps and scares have been seen before, it  still seems to scare you. The storyline is fantastic for a horror/thriller  film, very sophisticated but logical. Neve Cambell has done a terrific job  as Sidney Prescott, although it's hard to say the same for David Arquette.  The question that gets me thinking about the film is if Sidney is immortal  or not? Nothing seems to damage her, physically that is. The movie has a  decent duration and the actors are actually convincing in most cases. Wes  Craven has shown us what I think is his max and Courtney Cox does so  aswell. Scream 3 is definately worth purchasing, especially on the DVD  format.

He realized what would would have been too cliche  if done a 3RD time and changed it.  i.e. that manipulating voice  changer/recorder.  That was a stroke of genious.  Speaking of genious, most  fans of the previous films will notice the great subtlties eluding to the  first 2 littered throughout the picture.  The only flaw, minor as it may  be, is the lack of sidney's presense.  Her character is not as solid as  before, but what screen time she has is excellent.

I waited impatiently until its scheduled release in December of 1999.  I was shocked  to see it had been moved to February, but I waited even more impatiently.  In the best horror film series I have seen yet (and I have seen a lot), the  Scream series provided laughter, suspense, happiness, and sadness all in  one big package.  All the characters in this movie, as well as the other  two were written to the point that you know them, and you feel with them,  and even get scared with them.  The twists and turns in this movie kept you  guessing, but you just couldn't quite figure it out until you were told.  Even though there were different writers, the story was blended beautifully  and all your questions were answered at the end.  It was really the end,  unlike some horror series that kept coming with all new characters and  stories.  This movie was packed so tight that your eyes couldn't leave the  screen, almost sucked you in with its eerie flashbacks and daring escapes,  not to mention the all too famous murders that made Scream a classic.  This  movie, as well as the first two, were done as they should have been:  to  get you to sit, stay, and suck you into the downright horror that makes  them good.
