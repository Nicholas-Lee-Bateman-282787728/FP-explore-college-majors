3412501,2,B00188NXN4,"The mediocrity of the story for The Tale of Despereaux is rivaled only by its terribly indistinctive character designs and video game equivalent animation. As it mixes the worst concepts from Ratatouille, An American Tail and The Great Mouse Detective with a wasted cast of familiar talents and unrecognizable voices, it stumbles at originality with absurdness and an accustomed narration. The morals of the tale are apparent, but the method of storytelling is wearisome, humorless and unfortunately unentertaining.

In the kingdom of Dor, where the festive Soup Day is more celebrated than Christmas, the master chef prepares a new recipe to amaze the townsfolk. Presented first to the King and his family, the soup is spoiled by Roscuro the rat (Dustin Hoffman) when he accidentally falls into it. The Queen immediately dies from shock, and the King is overwhelmed with heartbreak. He bans the consumption of soup throughout the kingdom, as well as proclaiming it illegal to harbor or help a rat. The rat civilization is confined to Ratworld, hidden deep in the filthy sewers of Dor.

As the narrator (Sigourney Weaver) explains, the hero doesn't make an appearance until he is needed, so it is now that Despereaux (Matthew Broderick) is introduced. Born with incredibly oversized ears, Despereaux is a tiny mouse who walks with not a dash of timidity, doesn't scurry and never cowers. He's a giant in his own mind, and constantly seeks adventure in Mouseworld, the underground city of mice (an upper-class community that never mingles with rats). When his failure to learn the skulking ways of his teachers gets him exiled, he is abandoned in Ratworld, where he is saved by Roscuro. Wallowing in guilt, Roscuro seeks forgiveness from the King, while Despereaux is intent on telling the Princess (Emma Watson) a story - and then coming to her rescue when she ends up in the hands of an evil rat dictator.

The only worthy element in the story is a subplot that uses two generally good characters, Roscuro and Miggery Sow (a pig-farmer who dreamed of living in the castle, and is now a servant for the Princess), and turns them into a source of villainy. Ultimately they will seek a predictable redemption, but their appearances initially inspire sympathy - an alluring twist to throw at the audience. It's not much, but it's something, especially considering how this tale of nonconformity, bravery and courage lacks the will to inspire or excite.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX [2008] is based on the award-winning book by Kate DiCamillo, and featuring an all-star voice cast including Matthew Broderick, Dustin Hoffman, Emma Watson, Kevin Kline, Stanley Tucci, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, William H. Macy, Tracey Ullman, Robbie Coltrane, and Ciaran Hinds. The screenplay adaptation was penned by director Gary Ross and other luminaries as stated above.

The story is set in the Kingdom of Dor, which has fallen into perpetual sadness and darkness after its queen dies as a result of a freak accident caused by a rat in her soup. Banished from the surface world, rats have retreated deep underground and grown vicious and resentful. The mice in ""Mouseworld,"" are much more well-adjusted and very cuddly. Enter young Despereaux Tilling [Matthew Broderick], who befriends the lonely human Princess Pea [Emma Watson] and Despereaux Tilling becomes very enamoured with her and with tales of chivalry and brave knights.

Despereaux Tilling envisioning himself as a likewise honourable and courageous knight, Despereaux Tilling sets out to rescue the Princess Pea and save the kingdom from the grief that has gripped it for years. Along the way, he encounters Roscuro [Dustin Hoffman], a banished rat who wants to make amends with Princess Pea . . . until she rejects him. In the rats world it is dominated by the sinister Botticelli [Ciarn Hinds], who enjoys staging gladiatorial arena matches between doomed mice and a giant cat.

Princess Pea finds herself becoming Botticelli's prisoner due to the actions of her troubled and homely servant girl Miggery Sow [Tracy Ullman]. If Despereaux Tilling can save the Princess Pea, he might also just restore hope and light to Kingdom of Dor and prove that even the least among us deserve a chance. Oh, did I mention that soup is a major part of the story?

Rarely does an animated film follow traditional fairy-tale conventions without attempting to include as many popular culture references as possible. THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX is one of a kind, because it is a really beautiful animated film, and there is even animation-within-the-animation, and an epic that will delight children, their parents, and anyone who loves a good animated film alike. There is adventure and fantasy, especially Boldo, a creature made out of produce and voiced by Stanley Tucci, is one of the most amusing, imaginative screen characters in fairy-tale lore, but also the entire Mig subplot is especially poignant and a good lesson for children to learn, the only thing that might upset children is that the animated film raises an interesting question: Why are rats, the bringers of the Black Plague and one of the most detested urban pests, suddenly so popular as the heroes of animated films? Then again, the cuddly denizens of Flushed Away, Ratatouille, and THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX do not resemble their real-life counterparts, which parents should explain in the best way to their children. But if children thinks this what happens in those particular animal kingdom, children might not be so charmed by their antics in the animated arena. Again the result is exactly the kind of animated film the entire family should treasure, and will be especially enamoured and charmed for younger viewers, and especially the happy ever after end of the animated film and I suspect it will get repeat viewing many times, but what a shame it was not produced in 3D. But despite this, if you want to give children a magical experience of wonderful a fairy tale, then you will not go wrong with this excellent Blu-ray disc, and once children are hooked, I suspect they will beg their Parents to do lots of repeat performances.

Blu-ray Image Quality  Universal Animation Studios and Mediumrare Entertainment bring you this wonderful magic animation in stunning 1080p image presentation. The wonderful colours are captured well, from the bright blue skies and blue-green ocean waves of the introduction to the more muted tones of the castle and village to the vivid browns and golds of Mouseworld and the dark yet garish reds and blacks of Ratworld. In the bonus features we learn that the film-makers were trying to capture specific painterly styles, from the Vermeer-like Castle setting, to the Hieronymous Bosch-influenced Ratworld, and the video transfer does this justice with nary a compression artefact in sight, and the good colour saturation is very good detail overall. This Blu-ray presentation completely blows away the standard-definition inferior DVD. Compression artefacts and minor image flaws are nowhere to be seen, providing fans of this animated film with a totally sharp, and brilliant detailed of all the characters in this glorious magical animated film. Please Note: Playback Region B/2: This will not play on most Blu-ray players sold in North America, Central America, South America, Japan, North Korea, South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong and Southeast Asia. Learn more about Blu-ray region specifications.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Universal Animation Studios and Mediumrare Entertainment presents us with a 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience and captures the energetic film music score by composer William Ross well. Use of the surrounds is fairly subtle: a ""Land Ho"" from the rear right channel as a ship approaches the Kingdom of Dor, the rattles and clanks of armour and weapons all around us as one of our brave rodents escapes the King's soldiers, and some water drips and other ambient sounds to establish the dreary dankness of Ratworld are a few places where the surround channels are put to very good use, but when there are no surround sounds I had to crank the sound up quite a lot, because at the normal setting I have it was very quiet when the characters talk. The dialogue is very clean via the centre speaker, but a bit too pristine at times, sounding artificial. Surround elements is sparse, but well balanced, evenly mixed with the animated film's robust film music score. The bass is rich and lively, but not quite as enveloping, particularly during some of the animated film's more intense action sequences. All in all, this is a fine surround mix, and is always clear and intelligible which helps us to follow the animated characters sometimes complex motivations.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Special Feature: Deleted Songs [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [4:36] Here we get to view two deleted songs, which you view black-and-white storyboard drawings that have been animated and they are as follows: It's Great To Be A Rat and Soup, Soup, and it would have been interesting to see how it would have actually looked if they had been included in the finished animated film.

Special Feature: Making of THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [11:41] Here we go behind-the-scenes of the animated film with the cast and crew, especially seeing the voice cast in the recording session and are allowed to act out the scene they are putting their voices to, and also see the process involved in making this particular animated film. We also get to view some nice clips from the animated film and some very nice colourful illustrations. Contributors include: Hate DiCamillo [Author], Gary Ross [Screenwriter/Producer], Allison Thomas [Producer], Sam Fell [Co-Director], Robert Stevenhagen [Co-Direstor], Stanley Tucci [Boldo], Emma Watson [Princess Pea], Matthew Broderick [Despereaux], Kevin Kline [Andrew], Gabriele Zucchelli [Supervising Animator], Brad Blackbourn [Director of Photography], Evgeni Tomov [Production Designer], Jason Horley [Lead Digital Matte Painter] and Ryan Michero [Head of Lighting]. It is something that fans of this animated film should definitely check out.

Special Feature: Scene Progressions [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [35:08] Here we get to view six different scenes from the animated film and we also get to view how it progressed into the five different stages of evolution, until the finished animated film via the following: SCRIPT; STORYBOARD; LAYOUT, ANIMATION and FINAL LIGHTING and as we view each stages we get to hear the actual narration that is said in the film by Sigourney Weaver. With each six scene progression that are included, will only really be enjoyed by really die-hard fans interested in how it looks at each stage of production, and if you are not a fan of this process, by the time you get to the sixth Scene Progression, you might get very bored.

Special Feature: Top Ten Uses For Oversized Ears Featurette [2008] [1080p] [1.78:1] [1:20] Here is an extra bonus for young children, especially if they are getting bullied for being different, and informs them of the benefits of oversized ears, and especially with wonderful colourful illustrations, starting at number 10:

10. FLIGHT: Handy for those unexpected drops.

 09. BALANCE: Perfect for nay tightrope walking.

08. ENHANCED HEARING: To gain advantage when on a noble quest.

07. MAGIC TRICKS: Ever seen the old coin-behind-the-ear trick?

06: WIGGLING: Kids just love that.

05: PROTECTION: To help cushion your fall.

04. SHIELD: Handy in the event of unwieldy flying vegetables.

03. FANNING: To cool down after a perilous escapade.

02. SPEED: The airlift makes running feel light on your toes.

01. DISTINGUISHING FEATURES: They make you unique and that gives you confidence.

Finally, I suspect it is something older viewers will only feel it is only worth viewing once, but I suspect younger audiences will want a repeat viewing.

Finally, writer-producer Gary Ross has crafted an impressive screenplay that is ambitious without being condescending or predictable. Kate DiCamillo's fans should forgive Gary Ross and others for changing details to suit this animated film. If anything, the animated film should attract more readers ready to follow the more in-depth chronicle of Despereaux Tilling, Princess Pea, Mig, and the other magical characters that are introduced to in this very memorable and magical animated film. THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX is definitely a mixed bag, but is ultimately in my opinion very well done. The animated film is much more intended for family viewing with younger children; especially in the way the story is unfolds, as well as presented and it also includes plenty of humour for all ages to really enjoy. As a mainly children's animated film, it definitely provides a very good message, and shows you can have a very good time. Children will love all the characters, but especially Despereaux Tilling himself the mouse who is very lovable, very entertaining and especially as it has a fantastic and brilliant voice cast that gives the animated film that added bonus as well. The Blu-ray release is really fantastic and very colourful, and featuring also a great image and audio presentation for this animated film, while adding quite a few interesting Blu-ray special features. Highly Recommended!

I think comparing mediums is important, but there is no comparison between this film and the delightful book on which the film is so loosely based.

The novel has dark moments but in those moments there are teaching lessons.  I think the reason the movie has deviated so much from the original tale is this:  The novel is long and wordy, and includes three tales, so to speak.  The movie ""rushed"" through the three tales or character growth of the book. I encourage anyone to read the novel....the language, the vocabulary, and the themes are interesting to explore.  Please don't misinterpret this review, the movie is cute.  However, I wish the movie would have included more of the original novel.

3412640,2,B00188NXN4,Pretty dark for a G rating.  Kids didn't really like it.  Too scary.  Animation was OK.  Story was strong yet dark like I said.  The characters were not cookie cutter good-guy/bad-guy for the most part.  Most/some of them had their flaws but had redeeming qualities too.  The story dug into a few of these with reasons why they were the way they were which made it a bit more interesting.  The semi-retarded chamber-maid seemed like a bit of a demeaning characterization.,1449619200,,471,4.728395061728395
3412641,5,B00188NXN4,"One of my all time favorite films; up there with Casablanca, King Arthur, Agora and other epic adventures.
Being an illustrator myself, with each viewing I grow more amazed at the gorgeous animation here. Unlike most anime, Disney or Pixar films, both the background and the actual characters have similar depth, perspective, shadowing and detail. (most animated features have those marvelous backgrounds but the characters are one dimensional; understandable considering they MOVE, etc. yes we know what is done),  Here, though, it is pretty seamless.
  The voices are perfectly matched; Hoffman is great, Broderick is perfect and Langella  was certainly not wasted here with his wonderfully deep Christopher Lee-like tones...

I hadn't read the book, which is probably, I think now, a good thing. So for me, the film was a wonder. It is indeed a shame that for some, the book rendered such a fabulous experience
null and void.
  And, yes, I think probably older kids would like it, and adults should. Very young folk, perhaps not so much.
 Adults who study medieval history, especially in the Languedoc region, may find tidbits of interest in this little film which would escape others. Indeed, there are many layers to this fine
tale.
  Perhaps it is an acquired taste for devotees of chivalry only. Not many of those about.
It is indeed sad to realize what gems are trodden underfoot nowadays without a thought.
Education may be all but impossibly expensive in today's world, but self-education is still, thankfully, thus far, still available free at your local library.",1449360000,4,1574,5.089494163424124

3412660,5,B00188NXN4,"I can never forget the time where my sister and I (in are early teens) went to see this on the big screen. It was December 19th, 2008 and I originally wanted to see this because I had a crush with Dustin Hoffman at the time. Then after the opening credits I then realized that I actually came for Kevin Kline who is in this. Once I saw his name on the credits, I smiled and shrugged my shoulders. Then that's when I became a fan. I had to say the Despereaux is so versatile with his ears; he even used them as a hang glider in one scene. Whenever my sister and I hear Roscuro say stuff like ""No!"" or ""Keep moving!"", we pointed out that he sounded like Shifu when he (Roscuro) said those things. Andre is my absolute favorite character. When I showed this to my parents, they realized his part was so small and he sat and did nothing throughout the entire movie. There is a character that is named Princess Pea. I just called her Princess because the name of Princess Pea made me think of a fairytale ""The Princess and the Pea"". I got this DVD as an easter present. Sometimes I look at this and I can hear my mom say to Kevin when I met him ""She loves you from Despereaux."" The official website (which you can't go on there anymore) was fun and entertaining",1443484800,,1256,4.172839506172839

It's great for kids. It  really is, the animals talking to humans despite their leaders ban on interacting with humans.  The cast isn't bad, but the story line is quite weak from an adult standpoint.  But since it is for the kids it is good.

So if I were under 10 years old I would give it a 5 star rating; however, being the Dad who purchased the movie for his kids, it's only an OK movie.",1404345600,,654,3.9015151515151514

The story is not the usual bland, banal drivel we've come to expect from Disney Studios' works (except for the ones done by Pixar). Yes, there is some darkness in the story, but that makes it real. Anyone who completely shelters a child from reality to the point of ""all is sweetness and light"" shouldn't be allowed near children. Children need to know the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, and that it takes courage to confront what is wrong or evil. One of the more interesting points in this story is that a person who does wrong is not necessarily evil.

My students hated the fact that Despereaux was brave from the start--because for them the whole point is that someone who is afraid and timid CAN become a hero. They found Roscuro a huge disappointment in the movie as well--he was so wimpy and whiny in the beginning that his corruption is completely unbelievable and renders his redemption meaningless. The general meddling with the story to transform it into something banal, fluffy and antiseptic was unwelcome most of all by me, who, as a teacher, loved the book for the way it launched my students into rather deep discussions about corruption, redemption, inner darkness and light--as Neil Gaiman said, Fairy Tales are more than true not because they teach us dragons are real but because they teach us they can be beaten.

3412853,1,B00188NXN4,"The book was an absolutely DELIGHTFUL story. Charming, evocative, mysterious, fun, and cheerful for the most part. One of those stories that is just made for reading aloud, and which keeps the audience enthralled to the last word, and which provides a simultaneous sense of satisfaction mixed with disappointment when it ends. We read it together as a family, and it was thoroughly enjoyable. In fact, it is high on my list of Must Read books for children - oh, not very YOUNG children, because the story is too long for them, and requires connecting the dots between several story lines woven skillfully together. But 10 to 18 year olds - yes, even teens love this story. A lovely way to create bonds of shared memories for families with teens that they aren't sure how to connect with again.

I wish the movie captured even a hint of the charm and delight of the book. But it does not. We bought it, in hopes that it would capture some of the essence of the story (in spite of hearing bad reviews). To our great disappointment, it failed in every respect. Other than the name, and a few shared names of characters, and the mention of soup, the movie bore no relation to the story in the book.

The creators of the movie, from some misguided notion that they had to rewrite the story to capture the movie audience, managed to strip it of every defining characteristic, and to create a story that was not only devoid of any of the charm or enjoyment that the book possessed, but completely, and utterly uninspired and pathetic. It was a waste of money to even make such a travesty. Many other movie reviewers have agreed that the movie was on the low end of the scale. In fact, it is something that could only be appreciated by someone who had a very short attention span, no taste, and who had no previous exposure to the original story (the very young kids who appreciated the endless string of Land Before Time movies comes to mind).

It truly was not even the same story! They changed the settings, left out essential elements, threw in completely meaningless and worthless replacements, created environments in the story that had no reason for being there, and in short, utterly ruined it. I am not too harsh, in fact, there are not words available to truly describe the vandalism perpetrated by the unskilled crew who created the appalling monstrosity.

The sailing ship in the opening scene was the first clue that something catastrophic had occurred - the book does not go near the sea at all. The absence of essential character discovery, and the remake of the dungeon into something like the dark side of the rat city from Flushed Away were obvious and unpleasant changes which displayed the ignorance and amateurity of the vandals who posed themselves as screen writers. The cook - a female character with personality and some humorous appeal - was replaced by a male chef who was merely a caricature, and a bad one at that. The movie was replete with illogical changes such as this, bad whims, carried out with no purpose, and with a sense of pathetic uselessness. The crowning atrocity though, was the vegetable man (an incredibly stupid creation of dancing vegetables which completely destroyed the story line without any kind of benefit whatsoever) - which had all the feel of an addition by a recent graduate artist, who had created something like it for a school project, and just HAD to use it SOMEWHERE, whether it fit or not.

This book could have been recrafted as a movie that was worthy of the excellence of the original story. But because this company purchased the rights, and made such a travesty, they not only polluted the world with so much animated refuse, they also blocked those who would do it right from doing so for some time to come. I think that is the saddest thing about it. In the afterlife for film creators, there must be a special torture chamber reserved for the perpetrators of such heinous actions - where they are first blessed with the good taste they lacked in mortality, and then forced to view their own bad films through eternity!

Don't bother with the film. Buy the original book - the OLDER one, without the movie character illustrations (the ones in the older book are better). Read it aloud with your family. You won't regret it.",1358380800,15,4286,4.647757255936676

3412860,2,B00188NXN4,"I found this movie to be very disapointing. The Tale of Desparaux (the original book) has the potential to make a fantastic movie.....if you keep all of the elements that make it touching, sad, and beautiful. This movie took out many interesting details that raise all types of moral and social questions, and give the story a whole new level of meaning, from the background of Miggery Sow's life (her father selling her, how she had her ears boxed, etc) to the dungeon keeper and he and Desparaux's strange relationship. And then they added the whole thing with that ridiculous vegetable man! What was that?!
I understand that it was meant to be a kid's movie, and as a kid's movie it did very well, but I feel that whoever decided to take this beautiful book (by renowned author Kate Dicamillo)and turn it into a movie should NOT have made it into a kid's movie. The book is totally innapropriate for a very young audience (not in the sexual term, but in the sence of emotional maturity)and it would have done better as a movie for older veiwers....or, better yet, if it was not made into a movie at all.

I didn't find a whole lot to like in this slow moving animated feature starring the voice of Matthew Broderick as the titular Despereaux, a mouse with Dumbo-sized ears and a complete lack of fear (does that really enable courage or just stupidity?), an unlikely hero who helps save a princess and an unusual rat (voiced by Dustin Hoffman) against all odds.  Despereaux is ostracized from his mouse family and friends due to his willingness to associate with whomever and who has a knight's code of honor.  This allows him to make friend's with the princess, a winsome slender blonde-haried girl who is hopeful despite the recent death of her queen mum and the emotional absence of her grief-stricken father.  All of this is set around a chef with a supernatural vegetable being who helps him make the most tasty soup's in the kingdom.

There are some good messages in the film and it is exceedingly safe for children.  The storyline of the littlest person with the biggest and bravest heart is always a winner, but the film is slow.  The animation is fine but not overly colorful.  The voice acting is underwhelming, except for Dustin Hoffman; Broderick is bland as can be.  I hate to give this movie a bad review because it really is fine for the kiddies but, as an adult who watched it, it is dull, dull, dull.",1352764800,,1324,4.6239316239316235

3412880,3,B00188NXN4,"Well, it's not Disney or Pixar, but it is fun. However, the coming attractions (including Barbie and Thumbelina) give away a significant fact: this is designed for children, friends. Matthew Broderick is the voice of Despereaux, gentleman mouse. Emma Watson speaks for Princess Pea, and Dustin Hoffman gives voice to Roscuro the rat. I believe the narrator was Sigourney Weaver. So there's real talent here, and there's some very good animation, reasonably good writing, and on the whole it is a fun movie. But it is unquestionably a kids' movie.

I got nothing against kids, and I got nothing against kids' movies. But lately I've been spoiled to think of animation as being for both children and adults. They don't over-simplify, nor make things too sweet to be believable. Well, I hate to say it, but this one does.

Despereaux was different from the day he was born. His eyes were open right away, and he had enormous ears, each one as wide as his head, if not wider. He was smaller than the other mice of the same age, but he did not cower and he was not afraid. This is considered to be a serious flaw in his behavior. His parents and teachers confer on it, they figure he will grow out of his deviance, etc. It's a little too much like kids with learning disabilities being told they are really superior. Indeed, some of them are.

Because he's not afraid, he creeps into Princess Pea's room and finds she is so unhappy. Her father has gone a bit overboard mourning for her mother's death, drowning in a bowl of soup when she was shocked when a rat (yes, Roscuro) fell into it. Not only did he ban soup, he banned rats (like that was possible), and for reasons that are never made clear, the sun stopped shining and the rain stopped falling, so that all they ever had was a drought under grey skies.

There are several additional elements to the story, but to explain how they fit in would give away too much. There's a pudgy little pig-keeper who gets sold to the castle as a servant along with a consignment of pigs, and (again for completely unexplained reasons) ends up waiting on the princess. There's a boss rat who rules the population of rats which never see the sun because (a) there isn't any and (b) they have to keep out of sight or knights in full armor (why?) will go after them. I couldn't help feeling much of the plot was not so much thought out as an integrated story as pasted together under the ""wouldn't it be funny if"" sort of brainstorming session.

In the end, it's a pleasurable movie because Despereaux is in fact quite a heroic little gentleman and Princess Pea is rescued from the rats due to his creative thinking and his having befriended Roscuro at a critical moment in his life. The narration gives the credit to forgiveness, but it's not at all clear to which bit of forgiveness it refers. I felt the moral to the story was rather thin, compared to the more obvious theme of Despereaux's courage and honor.",1336953600,,2946,4.519699812382739

3412899,5,B00188NXN4,"When I head that ""The Tale of Despereaux"" was going to be turned into a movie, having read the book I couldn't help but feel a little uneasy about this move. This isn't for the usual reason of worrying about the movie not staying true to the book, but the fact that I thought it would stay in fact to true to the book.

See, if you have not read the book, you'll find that the story is told in a non-linear way, far from the best. My worry was, if the movie followed this story telling format, it would be a major bombshell. Eventually though, I did get around to watching the movie and found myself pleasantly surprised. I found the movie to be a good adaptation and better then the book.

The movie was told in a linear manner. The characters were given more depth to their characters then what the book put out. The things that grated on my nerves in the book were gone. The changes that needed to be made to make the movie successful worked. And I might add, the rat character is treated as a more gray area character then the books decided to treat him.

No... ""The Tale of Despereaux"" is not the most amazing film out there, I must admit. But considering the original source material, I personally think they did well. I've heard others who've read the books who disagree on this part, but that may also be due to the fact that I've read other book series similar to this like Redwall, so I know it isn't the best.",1308182400,,1420,4.2518518518518515

Every time they were like, ""oh, the princess is so beautiful,"" I was thinking, who? the girl with the thin head?

3412901,3,B00188NXN4,"I probably underestimated The Tale of Despereaux when it was first released back in 2008. I can recall only seeing one TV spot for it and not being impressed with it in the least. The colors used in the film are kind of bland and stale in comparison to nearly every other animated film released nowadays while the character designs feel a little uninspired, especially when it comes to the humans utilized in the film. But it's similar to trying to judge a book by its cover. There's usually at least one thing in every film, good or bad, that takes you by surprise whether it's an idea, a performance, a story point, a special effect, a script, or a score. That one thing can usually be described as the best thing about the film. The Tale of Despereaux manages to offer several surprises though and is a bit more creative at its core than you may be expecting.

Having not read any of the books, I wasn't entirely sure what to expect from the film. I've also always wondered if humans in films like this are purposely made to feel boring in comparison to the talking animal world around them since they're secondary to the story. I also feel like I was being too hard on the animation based on trailers and TV spots alone as it's easily both fluid and engaging from beginning to end. Mouse and rat hair are also exceptionally detailed and facial expressions, although not implemented to the extent you may be familiar with in Pixar films or Shrek, are spot-on. The opening credits are a fantastic introduction and lead-in. The constant use of needle and thread, medieval theme, and fable like atmosphere help establish the overall feel of what to expect from the film.

Our introduction to Chef Andre (Kevin Kline) gave off kind of a Ratatouille vibe at times, which isn't necessarily a bad thing at all. The use of mice and the importance of soup and the kitchen made the 2007 Pixar animated film jump to mind rather easily. Even the kingdom of Dor has a whole day devoted to soup. The similarities stopped once the soup spirit, Boldo (Stanley Tucci), entered the fray. It seemed so bizarre to have a spirit made of fruit and vegetables show up, but it fits the film rather well and the character has at least one memorable scene overall. Chef Andre's soup machine is intriguing, as well. The way it manages to do something as simple as make soup, but is rather intricate to handle so many different types of ingredients and large quantities of said ingredients is a pretty wondrous feat to behold.

Mouseworld and Ratworld are easily the film's biggest draw. Most of the film's originality and creativity lie within these two worlds. The fact that an entire world is micro-sized is kind of remarkable in itself, but the way matches are used as lampposts and a lens to a magnifying glass is used to reflect light make something so simple seem a little bit more complex. The arena in Ratworld also tends to be rather extravagant and fits that complex theory rather nicely. The fact that Despereaux seems kind of loosely inspired by Don Quixote really won me over, as well. As a fan of the imaginative, the bizarre, the ludicrous, and the absurd, that aspect probably spoke to me more than it would most.

The Tale of Despereaux is pretty decent overall. While it may not be as flashy or colorful as the animated films of today, its exceptional animation and unexpected bursts of creativity will more than likely make the film a worthwhile journey. The storyline does feel a little worn and familiar, which is probably the film's biggest flaw. Fortunately though, The Tale of Despereaux is still fairly entertaining and possibly a bit better than it lets on.",1307491200,2,3659,4.633281972265023

As much as I admire the cast of actors, their voices did not necessarily fit the looks of the characters. Despereaux was adorable and lovable, however I don't blame the mice for thinking there was something wrong with him. It wasn't because of him being different; it was because he was NEVER afraid. ""Being brave isn't about not being scared. It's being scared but doing what you have to do anyway."" Someone who is not afraid of anything is quite honestly more foolish than heroic. Regardless, the little mouse was so cute even if he did have idiosyncrasies. The beginning had a lot of exposition, the middle had the most humor, and the end had a moral. Why did the cook suddenly pick that day to make soup?  How was the sunlight a sudden jolt to wake up the King from his long period of mourning? These are among some of the questions I had.

3412919,2,B00188NXN4,"Just to warn you, there are possible spoilers in this review.

The Tale of Despereaux sounded like a really good movie. Who doesn't like cute and likeable characters voiced by good actors in a heroic tale. That's what this movie is marketed as, but once you watch it, you see that that's not the kind of movie it is at all.

The beginning of the movie was painfully slow. The plot did not advance well at all. There was no action until about the last half hour of the movie. Before that, all we got was the background story about the different players, which I must say, didn't really fit together all that well. So not only was most of the movie slow, it was also a little choppy and didn't really make sense. At the end it sort of all came together, but I was hoping for more of an ""ah-ha"" moment. It never came.

Something else that bothered me a little about this film was that it was rated G for all audiences, but I wouldn't let young children watch this movie. First of all, there is nothing to keep their attention. There was very little action and very few funny scenes (I remember laughing once when Despereaux tripped the mouse traps on purpose the first time and that's it). And secondly and more importantly in my opinion was the fact that most of the movie was very dark and disturbing. The bad guys were really disgusting and evil rats, who ate the mice that were banished to their ""world"" and who also at one point in the movie attempted to eat the human princess. They didn't succeed, but it gave *me* a nasty feeling, and I'm an adult. I would hate to think what it would do to young children.

Yet another thing that was a little annoying was the fact that at the end of the movie, where you would expect a moral (in this case, forgiveness rather than holding a grudge or being bitter is the right thing to do and it will make you feel good) was poorly presented. For example, the girl that helped betray the princess to the rats (who were going to eat her) didn't help her escape and never asked for forgiveness and that was kind of annoying and didn't seem to fit in with the ""moral"". But then, that whole character was kind of annoying, and didn't really add anything to the movie in my opinion. Telling her part of the story just made the beginning that much longer and more boring.

Also, on a side note, I wasn't all that impressed that a crack was made at the beginning about how, to the people of the kingdom, Soup day was better and more important than Christmas. This was just foolish and uncalled for. Again, it didn't advance the storyline any. It just came across as a cheap shot at Christmas.

All in all, the actors did a fairly good job with a really bad storyline. My recommendation is to skip this movie and go find something more funny or adventuresome.",1285632000,4,2791,4.337164750957855

The first thing I said when I saw the movie was ""ok that's not how the book starts."" But I thought I'd give it the benefit of the doubt, maybe it would get better as it went along. Unfortunately,it didn't...IT GOT WORSE!!! If the movie is your first introduction to ""The Tale of Despereaux"" please do yourself a favour and turn the movie off, and go read the book. You will be so much happier that you did!!",1285372800,3,531,4.115384615384615
3412921,4,B00188NXN4,"The Tale of Despereaux is one of those animated films that I'm really glad I went into with low expectations.  After all, I reasoned going in, this represents Universal Pictures' lone foray into a market dominated by heavy hitters like Pixar and DreamWorks.  Reviews at the film's theatrical debut were certainly mixed but the cast was nothing short of epic and the book on which the film is based seems pretty well accepted.

The DVD was the perfect compromise in my opinion and I went in to watching it expecting a smaller budget version of Ratatouille with a slight fairy tale slant (ala Shrek).  What I came away with was a pretty satisfying experience quite unlike any other animated feature on the market today.

The story goes something like this: Three unlikely heroes - a stunted, big-eared mouse who prefers reading books to eating them, an unhappy rat who schemes to leave the darkness of the dungeon, and a bumbling servant girl with dreams of being the princess of the kingdom- come together in grand fashion within the halls of the king's castle.

Calling The Tale of Despereaux a modern-day fairy tale is really the best way to describe the tones, moods and themes contained within.  So thorough are the small details contributing to these comparisons that it is incredibly easy to begin to question whether this was in fact based on a fairly recent book or something much, much older.

All of the classic ingredients are here: An unlikely hero, a medieval European setting, a narrow-minded king, hulking (if extremely unintelligent) knights, talking rodents and so on.  However, the formula begins to sway slightly the moment the viewer realizes that this singular tale is essentially the culmination of three separate stories that just so happen to come together fairly neatly by the end.

Of course it's the title character we're expected to relate with so his segments are, naturally, the most abundant and linear but the story thread concerning the rat Roscuro isn't too far behind.  Fortunately Sigourney Weaver's impeccable narration welcomingly strings the viewer along on the transitions and future pertinence of the story's alterations.

As expected, however, the tale as a whole doesn't flow quite as well as it should; particularly if the goal is to appeal to and attempt to hold the ever-fluctuating interest of a child.  Since I've never read the book on which this piece is based, it's impossible for me to confirm whether the way this story is told is a masterpiece translation of the original material or a fairly scattered assemblage of its own design so I will leave it at this: The story is a bit complex and disjointed to appeal to younger viewers.  The sheer cuteness of Despereaux and his cohorts may be enough to carry the momentum for a while but it appears kids, the younger ones especially, tend to get bored by the midway point of the film.

On the flip side, the structure is pretty well plotted for older kids/ adults to enjoy.  There is a bit of fairly dry humor strewn about but, and not unlike most Rated G feature films, it is wise to go in expecting little in the way of layered dialog or even visual silliness to inspire a chuckle.  Indeed Despereaux tends to take itself pretty seriously for the most part.  Fortunately the story is developed enough to justify the heavy burden.

The visuals themselves are quite impressive and what I initially suspected would hold this film back from Pixar or DreamWorks status.  It turns out I was quite incorrect in such assumptions as the color palette, lighting, texturing and animation are all first rate all the way through.  In fact the near-caricatured humans bring a very unique visual flair to the whole thing.  If looking at animated talking mice and rats seems a bit unrealistic, not to worry, the humans will offset any such concerns as will the dazzling cast and their stellar deliveries (Dustin Hoffman in particular brings a whole lot of class and depth to the fold).

In all The Tale of Despereaux is one of the more pleasant surprises I've come across.  I could not go as far as to say it's perfect entertainment for all ages (as kids, the primary audience no less, seem to become a bit bogged down in the narrative) and adults capable of appreciating its quaint charm will likely end up watching something a bit more, well adult.  However, there seems to be a segment of older kids, young teens who will appreciate this one for its strengths which, in case you haven't already realized, are quite numerous.",1285372800,,4512,4.790967741935484

3412923,2,B00188NXN4,"That was the word my 7 y/o daughter uttered, after about 5 minutes , to discribe the ""man who made this movie"". You see, we had just spent the last two weeks reading the book, a few chapters every night. And my daughter really liked it, and with the first few minutes the makers of the movie had taken great liberties with the plot. Mind you I have no problem with Cook being a man in the movie when she was a woman in the book, the Vegetable Man that appears at the beginning doesn't even exist in the book but I didn't have a problem with that either ( ""What in the world is that?"" asked a very pissed off 7 y/o). But the thing that really not only annoyed my daughter but really pissed me off too was that Roscuro the rat is shown here as Despereaux's BFF when in the book he is actually the bad guy, and I mean THE BAD GUY. Yes in the book for a couple of pages he's not that bad but after he is just the Devil incarnate until he sees the light. Despereaux and Roscuro don't even meet in the book until they are ready for their dual. And here they are shown as friends, now I know that books will change when brought to the screen but to actually have something so blatantly different is just ridicules.
The movie also shows Despereaux as a one dimensional hero that doesn't seem to be afraid of anything, when in the book he is a much more rounded character with many faults, one being that he faints when he gets very nervous. This leads to the point where he wills himself not to faint in order to save the Princess, in the movie there is no great change in our hero.
In short this movie is not worth your money, buy the book and read it with your child, you will have a great time with all the suspense and backstories that you get when reading the book. Your child's imagination will leave you speechless.",1280188800,2,1814,4.141643059490085

It just unfolds.... moment by painful moment. True, it could have been worse with a chorus and a kick-line, but I believe myself to be sufficiantly scarred.
This film is full of brain-washing ideas for a rated G movie. I would not show it to children-- ever. Soup is, in this movie, ""better than Christmas,"" the portly ""ugly"" characters wind up together isolated out of town by the end of the film, NONE of the females seem to have the ability to read and rely on male mice to do this for them, and of course, all father figures in this film have abandoned their children in this film.

Anyone who has taken the time to aquaint themselves with rats would know this. The author obviously bases her plot on outdated and cruel prejudices born of ignorance. This would have been a very different movie if the animals' true natures had been honored.

Happily this movie has not only a superb script which explores important human values, virtues and failings, it also uses only the finest ingredients;  great voice acting, beautiful, original, and fitting design and art work, and top notch animation.  And all this executed by the hands of master chefs--uh craftsmen.

As many reviews here suggest, it is too strong and too deep for young children.  The Mrs, who has a better feel for these things than I, says the minimum age for this movie should be around 9 or 10.",1259280000,,651,4.626086956521739

I found the story to have a great message, but not enough excitement and sharp wit....something I've grown accustomed to as of late with so many top notch animated films. It's not a bad film, but there are certainly much better animated films and also many worse!

3412964,1,B00188NXN4,"This is a G-rated movie, or at least that is the rating provided by the MPAA.  It should never have been rated G.  The film includes scenes in which the princess, after being betrayed by her handmaiden, is about to be eaten alive by rodents.  That's probably the most egregious part; however, there are lots of other similarly disturbing parts - things that will almost certainly be upsetting for younger children.

The overall tenor of the film is very dark.  It is NOT a cute, happy movie to give to children.  Some other reviewers here claim that it teaches children life lessons; if so, then it should be noted that top among those lessons are: that friends betray you, bad things happen, often for no reason; and that the world is a miserable and lonely place.

The little critters were cute, and the adults interesting.  Like Bees movie, talking to people was forbidden by the powers that be in the mouse world.  And the parents were distressed over their fearless child.  But in the end, good things happened all around.

3412971,2,B00188NXN4,"This is a beautifully animated fairy tale centered on a yearly Festival of Soup that has a cast of mice, rats, a cat, and of course, The King and Queen and Princess of Dor.

There is an annual Soup Festival that is more popular than Christmas.  This festival made everyone happy and the sun shines and music plays and laughter is everywhere.

The tale is convoluted and hard to follow for an adult, so I wonder if children can follow.  They will love the animation, cute characters and some of the action, but if it is not that fulfilling as a story as it does not make sense.

We see Roscuro, the rat, leave a ship docked in Dor and he causes a terrible accident during the wonderful Soup Festival.  He falls in the Queen's soup and she faints and falls in the bowl and dies.  (I sat and wondered why no one pulled her head out of the bowl).  The King is heartbroken.  He is depressed.  Suddenly the sky turns dark and no color or sunlight or even rain comes to the Kingom of Dor.  Just because a rat fell in the soup and the Queen fainted - then drowned in the gourmet soup.

So as the Kingdom of Dor falls apart, a hero is born -  It is a small mouse by the name of Despereaux.  He is one of the cutest animated subjects with ears as big as Dumbo the Elephant.  Despereaux is a worry to his parents and teachers because he is not afraid, he does not crouch or hide.  He has no knowledge or reason to be afraid.  He reads books on brave and noble knights  and chivalry.  You wonder why they make such a big deal of not hiding or running from everything.  In later scenes is is clearly afraid of a cat the rats release.

Then Dexpereaux is banished from his mouse home for not behaving ""mousey"" - scared and frightened and ready to run.

We realize there is a mouse level of civilization and another level below ground is the rat level.  The story gets a bit off track.  It is also confusing to see Roscuro the Rat as Despereaux's friend (who is sort of a rebel in the rat world)  - and then later  - Roscuro turns into an enemy - because the Princess did not like him as a rat.  It seemed odd or off kilter from the story.

A sub-plot in this story is a jealous maid to the princess who wants to be a princess.  She is reunited with her dad who gave her up as a baby.  He finds her by seeing a birthmark on her neck - calls her his ""Princess""  -  this also seems off the focus of the story.

Even though the story is blah and a bit meandering - the characters are cute and interesting.  Big name stars do the voices: Matthew Broderick, Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Kline, Richard Jenkins, Robbie Coltrane, William H. Macy, Tracey Ullman, Sigourney Weaver, Frances Conroy, etc..

But you can see what other reviewers are talking about when they say the story is a mess.  Leave the room for a minute and you'll be completely lost when you come back.

It's not just the convoluted nature of the plot that's a problem:  it's that, since the story gets you emotionally connected to one character for about twenty minutes, then abruptly changes course and follows another for 20 minutes, you find yourself feeling disconnected and uninvolved.

Additionally, elements of the plot are downright illogical.  Since when was its the rats' goal to consume the princess?  Seemed like that came out of nowhere.  And that part about how the mice are deliberately taught to be craven?  That might have sounded okay on paper, but it certainly doesn't fly on screen.

3412977,1,B00188NXN4,"What an absolutely horrible movie.  While the CGI animation was interesting and well done the story was shocking and horrifying.  Any child that isn't traumatized from this film wasn't paying attention, thus making it a bad film for its ineptitude to maintain its audiences' interest.  For those of us that did follow the story line (especially small impressionable children) will no doubt wake up screaming from what could have happened in the movie. (Spoiler Alert Below!)

I've seen many sci-fi horrors that maintain an R rating while the violence and horror aren't actual visuals but implied.  The imagination is a powerful additive to the cinematic experience.

When you are first engulfed in Rat World you are greeted with gruesome sights of rats using human skulls/bones for decor and mobility.  I'm not squeamish and thought this was fine in itself... after all the rats live in the dungeon and there probably could be some catacombs around the corner (of course by the end of the movie I wonder at how the owners of said bones met their ends).  As adults we are all well informed on what a rat's diet consists of.  No biggie kids don't look too closely- and Disney's used skulls without any repercussions.

SPOILER ALERT:

Now here is where the real problem comes in.  The whole story was downright dull and the whole ""weave a new fairy tale in the fashion of old"" routine is just that OLD.  We (the audience) know we are moving to the climax and then thereafter the happily ever after.  When I think of a great plot twist for kiddies it ALWAYS involves kidnapping a princess (check) an unlikely hero (check) a villain you can really hate (check) and mortal peril involving the princess facing being eaten alive by dozens of rats!  That's right folks... I haven't seen rats trying to devour human flesh since everyone's favorite ShowTime Serial Killer, Dexter.

If you want to show your kids dark, sick, and twisted stories stick with the Brothers Grimm least you can hide behind the pretense that they are acknowledge masterpieces and not new cinema garbage.

He fell into such a dark hole (literally and figuratively), and all he wanted to do was make things right again. He's the real hero in my opinion. Yes, he had a downfall, but every hero gets lost once in a while.

I thought the three different worlds were interesting - Mouesworld, Ratworld and the human world - the plot that unfolds between them never lagged. Although, the soup story was kind of a weird way to start off, but it's suitable for youngsters and fits in with the G rating. I did think that for a G-rated film there were several moments that might waver on the scary side for small children, but there wasn't any bloodshed shown and the dramatic fight scenes weren't too harsh and didn't last long.

Overall, well done with likable characters, an engaging tale, and the moral of forgiveness shines brightly at the end. I'm glad I watched.",1244073600,,1050,4.544973544973545

I also thought (and I have never read the book, so perhaps I'm wrong) that some of it was a rip off from ratatouille...the appreciation of the soup, the rat guiding the human, and the one head evil rat, to my mind, was a rat version of the snooty food critic Anton (?).

3413016,5,B00188NXN4,"I for one did not read the book.  Actually, I barely heard of the movie, my wife picked this up for us to watch with the kids before we watched our movie.  It turned out to be an excellent animated movie with emphasis on movie.  What I appreciated about Tale of Despereaux was the fact it had a story to tell and it was done very well.  This is not just another animated fluff movie full of one liners and stupidity.  It has enough action to keep the young's attention, of course what's an animated movie without a few talking animals and a magical character who goes from assistant chef to.......  well I won't let that out of the bag.  I also appreciate the fact this movie takes the time to develope the main characters, you understand the reason they do what they do, it makes you feel for the characters, whether you like them or not, your opinion could even change on certain characters as the movie unfolds, and no loose ends are left hanging at the end of the movie.  The plot is not predictable as many of the Hollywood carbon copy dribble is today.  I found Tale of Despereaux an entertaining movie that kept my attention as a 40 something, my grandson's, who is 4, and feel it can do the same for all ages.  I personally hope to see more animation coming out that has this type of depth to the story.  As some one already mentioned this is an excellent family movie and done cleverly so.  For instance, one place in the movie a character sneaks a knife out of the kitchen, as an adult you know full well what is going on but the knife is never shown again.  Another place it is incenuated one character will eat the other but they go through a door which closes behind them.  And, whether you understand fully what happens there is really irrelevant because justice was served and a bad guy is out of the movie, which was the point.  What I'm trying to say is children will still understand the story as it's done here without graffic deeds being shown.

When you make a movie based on a book it's inevitable that comparisons will be made and people will be interested to know if it follows the book line by line but it should stop there.  Try to judge the movie based on it's own stand alone merits.  It's entertainment, not a history lesson.

3413020,3,B00188NXN4,"How do I describe THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX? On the one hand, it's got top-notch animation, wonderful voice acting, and interesting characters. On the other hand, it has a few too many characters, grown-up themes, and requires the viewer's rapt attention. On the gripping hand, it's just not for little ones. To be clear, it's fine for young ones to watch, it just seems that they are not the film's intended audience. This is odd since it LOOKS like it's a kid's show. It was advertised as a kid's show. But my 4-year-old only watched when Despereaux himself was on the screen, and my 11-year-old spent most of the movie telling me how different it was from the book. My husband and I liked it, but we all agreed it was simply ""OK.""

THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX is actually a couple of tales, starting with the story of a sea-faring rat named Roscuro who loves soup. Through a horrible twist of fate, Roscuro's presence results in the queen's death (death by soup, believe it or not) and the banning of soup and rats from the kingdom. I had to wonder why no one had thought to banish the rats before but eh. Roscuro ends up in the dungeon where only the rats hang out. The second story is about Despereaux the mouse. We decided that Despereaux must be Flemish for ""Dumbo"" since that's pretty much who this mouse looks like. He can even fly with his giant ears. Despereaux is literally fearless and as such is banished from mousedom for fear of the other meeses learning his bad traits. Guess where he's banished to. That's right, the rat dungeon. Another story is about a peasant girl who dreams of being a princess. Apparently, this was toned way down from the novel, in that the girl's owner only sneers at her and doesn't beat her in the movie. We see how she is sold to the king's cook along with a herd of pigs. She eventually teaches us a lesson about jealousy. Then there's the king's story. He's so sad at the loss of the queen that he bans soup and rats (as we've covered) and sits in his room all day plucking a mandolin. His sadness manifests itself as gray clouds and no rain - everything dies. Then there's the princess who wishes she could fix everything, the jailer who wishes he could undo a tragic mistake, a cook who wishes he could once more make soups, an evil rat who doesn't seem terribly evil, and, and, and... As I said, there's a whole lot going on.

The short answer is that THE TALE OF DESPEREAUX itself is not offensive, but there are better options in this genre. Take a look at&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragon-Hunters/dp/B001U3D88M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragon Hunters</a>, for instance.

Whew.  That is a mouthful, yet it does not even scratch the surface of the Universal animated film.  The story is enchanting, and the entire production is packed with big name voice actors, and a manifold thematic presence.

Matthew Broderick is Desperaux, repeating an earlier role from Ladyhawke when he played Phillipe the Mouse who also crawled through a sewage system to escape.  Other actors included in the cast are Dustin Hoffman, Kevin Kline, William H Macy, Tracy Ullman, Emma Watson, Sigourney Weaver, and Christopher Lloyd.  The 3D animation is outstanding (very early Disney like in many spots) , and only on a couple of occasions are the backgrounds not meshed well.  It`s not a far stretch to imagine Mickey Mouse in the place of Desperaux, and Goofy as Roscuro as they take on the rats at the film climax.

Not many of the modern animated films keep viewers interested in the story, but this one does.  Desperaux is a modern Galahad.  While his mouse companions are scurrying in fear, he is walking boldly into the unknown.  While others are eating books, he is reading them.  His befriending of the princess,  is enough to outcast him.  Roscuro, the rat, is inspired by Desperaux`s tales of honor and bravery.  His honor, is tested and in the end rings true.  The mourning king, lives in the past, while playing his mandolin amidst tears.  The dark pall that hangs over the kingdom remains as long as a king does not hope, and forgiveness does not live in the hearts of the Dorians.  The Princess`servant, traveled to the castle to be in the big house, to be a princess.  Once there, even being near her princess was enough.  The jailer, who lost his daughter many years ago, still mourned too.  Only when he found her, and she realized that she has value to her father, does she truly become a princess in her own life.  Specifically, the themes of courage, forgiveness, redemption, and encouragement are dominant in the film.

I really liked this film, and highly recommend it to film goers of all ages.

The previews showed the best part - the mouse like no other.  The rat, voiced by a dull Hoffman (time to really retire), was never developed.  The narration was dark, dreary, and barely moved the movie from one (well animated) bad scene to another dark scene.  The end was stupid - the chef, who was told to not make soup, SUDDENLY decides to make soup.  This makes the clouds finally drop their rain.  The rain makes all the loose ends come together somehow.

Nothing really happens in the film until the very end when there is a little action.  and Despereaux, supposedly the main character, isn't often even in the film.  I found they tried to throw in aspects from the book but didn't give them enough background or fleshed the ideas out enough, resulting in a very fragmented film.

3413027,1,B00188NXN4,"Since its publication, I have read ""The Tale of Despereaux"" to my third grade classes.  Even if the students knew the story, every year they begged to hear it again.  I loved reading DiCamillo's beautiful and subtle tale of forgiveness and redemption.  She literally spoke to the reader - asking them to think about events in the story.  I was excited, then, to see the film version of this deep and amazing book.

As I viewed the movie, my disappointment was palatable.  With the destruction of the book through the invention of scenes and characters, I was shocked at the needless violence interjected into the story.  Isn't a dungeon scary enough to interest an older child?  Does one need gladiators to excite an audience?  Sadly, the incredible artistic qualities of the film were not enough to rescue this ill-fated film.  I would never recommend this to my students or to anyone else.

What does it take to keep filmmakers honest?  It has been done. I cite the film versions of the books by C.S. Lewis and J.K. Rowling.  Even the book, ""Watership Down"" was given a movie worthy of its story.

The film tells of Despereaux (voiced by Matthew Broderick), the tiny but courageous mouse and Roscuro (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), the sailor rat. At the opening of an annual soup festival in the kingdom, Roscuro arrives at port. His curiosity to see the royal chef's famous soup firsthand inadvertently leads to the death of the queen and the subsequent banning of soup, and banishment of rats. Grey, gloomy years follow until Despereaux comes along. Ridiculed by his fellow mice for his total lack of fear (which is apparently vital for a mouse), Despereaux follows his brave and adventurous spirit and meets the princess of the kingdom. This leads him to be banished from his mouse world, and sent to Ratworld. There the two protagonists meet and form a strong bond, vowing to bring joy back to the princess's heart. However, when the princess won't hear Roscuro's apology, he turns bitter and plots revenge against her. It will take Despereaux to save the princess and get Roscuro - and the kingdom - on the right track.

This movie has an important message of forgiveness and hope. It's also interesting to see themes like abuse of power and social bullying at play, themes not often explored in animation. But first and foremost, boy is this a beautiful film! Roscuro is the first character we really come into contact with, and I just wanted to keep looking. It was his scene that was the little I saw of the movie to begin with, and made me want to see more. He's the star of the movie in my opinion. The movie is superbly animated and visually presented in every way. The settings and characters attract you to the screen. This truly is a movie made with heart.

Give this film a chance, it's an astounding animated movie. It's beautiful, has wonderful characters, it's very well animated, it has a strong and well-delivered message. I live for films like this. I'm getting this the minute it comes out.",1238025600,2,2158,4.614583333333333

Despereaux (Broderick) is a mouse who is banished from Mouseworld for not acting like a mouse.  He doesn't cower, he doesn't intentionally trip mousetraps, and he speaks to humans.  In the human's world, he meets Princess Pea (Watson), and decides to go on a quest for her to restore sunlight to a dark and grey kingdom.  He is assisted by the rat Roscuro (Hoffman), who had caused the problem in the first place.  Meanwhile, Miggory Snow (Ullman), the princess's servant, is plotting to remove the princess and take her place.

""Despereaux"" has a more complex story than one might expect from G-rated fare, but it is not too much to alienate younger viewers.  The storylines intersect well, and all come together in the end.  The animation is good, but not Pixar quality.  That is a small complaint, and Pixar is in a league of their own anyway.  The voice talent is made up of many big names, and Broderick, Hoffman, and Watson are all excellent.

That does not mean you shouldn't ever see this.  It's a worthy rental for sure.  However, I should clarify who might benefit from renting this ineffective film.

YOU SHOULD RENT THIS IF...
...you really love beautiful computer rendering.  This film is a study in computer art.  Like most major CG features these days, the animation is well done.  Like most CG features, the voices are acted well enough.  Where ""The Tale of Despereaux"" stands out from the crowd is in sheer visual beauty.  If this does it for you or you're just curious, what the heck, rent away!

YOU SHOULD NOT RENT THIS IF...(and there are more of these ""ifs"")
...you actually want an original and engaging story.  This film is painfully predictable and not particularly interesting.  If you ever want to feel that the hero is truly in peril or has a chance to fail, this won't do it for you.  There is peril and danger for sure, but never will you doubt the outcome.

...you've had enough fantasy stories featuring a brave little mouse.  Let's face it; this mouse thing has been done to death.  I'm sure the book was better, but this is not the book.

...you have sensitive children.  For my kids (10 and 6) this film was a bit of a bore and quickly forgotten.  For other kids it was terrifying and disturbing.  So parents, keep your children's sensitivity level in mind before you let your kids see it

...you're mad at Matthew Broderick for cheating on his wife.  I could not get that out of my mind while watching this!  For me, Despereaux became just a little bit less heroic because of that. (Or is it just me?)

DESPERATLY SEEKING DESPEREAUX
Personally, I would fall into the ""Rent it for its visual beauty"" crowd.  To be fair, there are moments in this film that have heart felt emotion or interesting character developments, but when pieced together those moments made for an uneasy mix.  Not even the beautiful imagery could make up for the overall predictable outcome of the story.  If you need an expert opinion then ask my kids.  They have yet to asked if I'm going to buy the DVD.

3413045,2,B00188NXN4,"""The Tale of Despereaux"" may qualify as a new film but it is far from qualifying as a new idea, unless one has never heard of the concept of a family-friendly animated movie featuring, as its main character, a cute, affable and heroic little mouse who speaks English, along with his rodent brethren. More significantly (not that conversing in a way thought to be exclusive to the human species is not significant), the character in question seems much more enlightened than the average mouse and, on top of everything else, also tries to save the world, or at least make some sort of difference. Examples abound, from Walt Disney's original cartoon mouse named Mickey to 2007's rodent chef in ""Ratatouille."" In between, there have been cartoon mice portrayed in the more conventional role of catbait (ala ""Tom and Jerry"") and in the less plausible role as superhero coming to save the day (""Mighty Mouse""). There was also that story in the eighties called ""An American Tail,"" about a mouse living the life of an immigrant to America. Somehow our furry friends seem so much cuter and sympathetic on screen in such productions than they usually appear in real life, found scurrying in piles of garbage, filthy sewers and whatnot.

The likeable mouse in this outing, bestowed with the heroic-sounding name Despereaux (voiced playfully by Matthew Broderick) is an unusual mouse, indeed, and not only because of his appearance, which features an average cartoon-mouse body, topped with huge ears resembling those of Dumbo. His behavior is a problem. Where he should eat the pages of books, he reads the books--with sincere interest. Where he should cower, he innocently stands his ground. Where he should be meek, he's brave. So unlike his mousy community is he that his teachers and his parents grow seriously concerned about him, as all attempts to teach him the sacred traits  and rites of mousehood fail to impact him in any meaningful way. Eventually, he's banished from the community falls--rather literally--into the dark, dank dungeon that is home to the vicious rats.

Conveniently enough, he meets Roscuro (Dustin Hoffman with an accent that is vaguely Bostonian), a friendly rat who used to be the assistant to the (human) royal chef--it seems ""Ratatouille"" inspired someone--in the lavish palace before a culinary accident that kills the queen and resigns the king to never-ending melancholy about his dear departed and other misfortunes forced our misunderstood and maligned rat into a life of exile in the underground. He longs to return to the gentility and prestige of the royal family, but his appeals to Princess Pea (Emma Watson), the most accessible member of the family and on whom he has something of a crush, go misunderstood, with disastrous consequences.

The story is also about the humble Miggery Sow (Tracey Ullman), a servant to the princess who--after yet another misunderstanding (there seem to be many of them in this film)--finds herself no longer at the gracious side of the princess she so respects and honors, but toiling in the dark, obscure bowels of the castle, leading a life filled with miserable drudgery.

As one predicts early on--less from the nature of Despereaux than from the fact that such is usually the case with films of this sort--the mouse at the center of it all plays a part in the lives of all of these characters and more. Eventually, what was wrong is righted. Obscurities in characters' lives unexpectedly become clear (unexpected to those characters, not to the audience). There's a climactic battle toward the end of the story, as you may have figured (because there always is), this one involving hordes of the hostile rats who conspire to overthrow the monarchy.

Though the movie, at ninety minutes, does not have an epic running time, it still feels as though it could have spared several minutes. Its story rambles somewhat and is not particularly inventive--more like a scattershot assemblage of bits and pieces of enduring themes from other, more memorable stories (empire in decline, people--and animals--banished from their rightful lives, lost dignity, alienation, fighting for one's beliefs, reunions with long-lost family, damsel in distress, and so on). As usual with movies such as this, an army of celebrities has been cast to play the voices. Aside from those already mentioned, we hear Robbie Coltrane, Richard Jenkins, Kevin Kline, Frank Langella, Christopher Lloyd, William H. Macy, Stanley Tucci and narration by Sigourney Weaver.

Meanwhile, the animation is well-crafted and, to its credit, does not share the overly-sleek and -shiny look that most computer-rendered animated movies flaunt, presenting images that feel a touch closer to an enhanced, yet classic, hand-drawn aesthetic, presented in colors that don't feel too artificial. However, it is, ultimately, fairly average animation that does not push the envelope in any way or offer anything of significance by which to remember itself.

Such is the case with the rest of the film. We live in an age in which there are not only more films produced annually than any time in recent memory, but there are many animated features (mainly from outside the US) that push the boundaries of the film, of storytelling, and of the subject matter that can be told. Not that there haven't been some compelling individual animated movies from the States lately, but virtually all major Hollywood animated movies of at least the past decade are interchangeable in terms of aesthetics, target audience, and overall story arc. Once upon a time, Hollywood was known for being innovative in animation. But, while ""Despereaux"" is not a disaster, it is unfortunate that a film which purports to be about a character who represents boldness in the face of spirit-crushing submission passed off as an acceptable norm is itself content to remain nothing more than just one more banal, unchallenging movie in crowd full of them.",1234742400,5,5942,5.087179487179487

3413047,5,B00188NXN4,"(No spoilers in this review)

""The Tale of Despereaux"" is a story about the positive effects that those on the fringe of society can have on those around them.

Despereaux is a non-mouse-like mouse who isn't afraid of things, doesn't scurry, and won't hide like mice are supposed to do.  He's smaller than other mice, but he has an enormous heart full of courage.  At the same time, a friend of his, a rat, is also unusual in that the rat likes the sun instead of the dark.  Together they try to right a terrible wrong, and to restore happiness to those who are in sorrow.

I think that I can imagine why some people don't like this show.  They may not like it because it is lacking in the kind of frenetic action that is the norm for children's animated movies these days (e.g.,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shrek-Full-Screen-Single-Disc-Edition/dp/B00009ZYC1/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shrek (Full Screen Single Disc Edition)</a><a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Madagascar-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B00005JNX0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Madagascar (Widescreen Edition)</a>).  The Tale of Despereaux also differs from most other recent animated movies that target children because Despereaux is notably short of wise-cracking, even crass characters commonly found in other offerings.

OK, those are some difference, but what's there to like?  Well, the creators of this movie were able to recruit an amazing set of actors to provide the voices for the project.  There is also significant character development.  You won't go far into the movie before you start to relate to the characters in one way or another, and the character development continues throughout the entire movie.  The characters develop ties to each other during the movie, and you enjoy following them along.

The animation is very good, there's no doubt about that, and the plot is engaging and thoughtful - things missing from the vast majority of children's movies these days.

So, if you and your children enjoy thoughtful, deeper story lines, then this show may be for you.

3413048,1,B00188NXN4,"As a parent I've sat through my share of crummy kid's flicks.  ""The Tale of Despereax"" however, left me stunned.  This was less of a chilren's movie and more of a primer on how to commit child abuse.

Movie devotees will rave about the animation which was first rate, but the story was terrible.  Look at the trailer and you'd think the story was about a cute little mouse waving a needle like a sword.

Well, that cute little mouse is turned over to grand inquisitors BY HIS PARENTS because he refuses to cower.  For his crime, Desperaux is sentenced to be eaten by rats.

Repulsed yet?  Add to that a young girl, Miggery Sow, beaten, abused and sold into slavery along with a bunch of pigs.  She winds up at the castle, steals the princess' crown, gets offended when someone laughs at her and drags the King's daughter down to the dungeon so she too can be eaten by rats.

Desperaux rushes to tell the King that the princess is in the cellar about to be eaten alive but the old fool is too busy wallowing in self-pity to lift a finger.

Then someone whips up a pot of soup and all is sunshine again.

I will never take my son to a Dreamworks production again without checking the reviews first.  A plot line that features rats eating young girls and cute little mice is not suitable for children...or their parents.",1231718400,13,1317,4.392561983471074
3413059,4,B00188NXN4,"I ended up enjoying this movie a lot more than I expected. The animation meets very high standards, but there's a lot of good animation around these days. Instead, it features characters that I really like and a surprisingly complex plot.

I liked the premise, too, that the brave little mouse lives in Mouseworld society where bravery is actively discouraged. He even talks to humans - an unconscionable act of bravery. He goes through life blithely unaware that there's anything wrong, until his antics earn exile from his timid world. That's about when things start getting complicated. A third society, the rats, adds itself to the mouse and human worlds, with plots moving along in each and between them. Another movie might have collapsed under the weight, but this one managed to tie all the threads together and finish them off neatly.

A number of dramatic moments might be a bit much for skittish kids. Perhaps the book would help prepare your little one, but you'll know best. The right kid will enjoy it a lot, but there's plenty here for the grown-up buying the tickets, too.

Despereaux escapes from the Rat World dungeon and seeks to return sunlight to the Kingdom of Dor. The kingdom has been in mourning since the death of the Queen due to an unfortunate incident involving soup and a rat named Roscuro.

Meanwhile Roscuro seeks the forgiveness of the Princess. But, when his apology is refused, Roscuro turns bitter and seeks his revenge by manipulating a jealous chambermaid named Millery Sow. Eventually Despereaux, Roscuro and Millery find their ""happily ever afters"" and the Kingdom of Dor is restored to its former greatness.

This is an intelligent, ambitious kid's story that touches on the themes of bravey, kindness and mercy. These are values worth teaching. But the movie has so many sub-plots and metaphors involving soup, rain and a spool of thread it's easy to get confused. Perhaps these were better explained in the book. In any case, this is a better than average movie that most children and many adults will appreciate.",1230163200,5,1170,4.934010152284264

There are multiple ""main"" characters all of whom are experiencing existential dilemmas or, in the case of the maid, a psychotic break. Note to parents of young kids, this psychotic break means that she decides that SHE is the princess and then (on the advice of a once kind, now malevolent, rat who she thinks is just a voice in her head giving her directions) kidnaps the princess to be eaten by feral rats in a gladiator style ring. I swear I am not making this up. The titular main character, Despereaux, although cute is kind of an afterthought in the psych ward of the rest of the story. He is banished and condemned to death (this is a kids movie?!?!) by the mouse council of elders because he is not afraid enough. His parents buckle to societal pressure and kick him to the curb. He is then tossed to the gladiator pit as bait for a rabid cat for the entertainment of the mob of rats. I kept waiting for any of this to make sense and it just didn't happen.

3413066,4,B00188NXN4,"In the Kingdom of Dor, the greatest day of all was Soup Day.  The royal chef spent months figuring out the day's special soup.  And, of course, it was fed first to royalty.

Only this year, Roscuro, (v by Dustin Hoffman) a rat coming in on a ship, smells the soup and ventures to the castle out of curiosity. By accident, he falls into the soup and frightens the Queen to death.

The King goes into mourning.  He banishes the rats to the dungeon, cancels Soup Day, and locks up his daughter, Princess Pea.

In the meantime, a young mouse Despereaux (v. by Matthew Broderick) is born without the usual mousely survival instincts. He reads the tale of the Princess in a book he's supposed to eat and vows to help her.  You see, he's not a mouse, he's a gentleman of the truest sense of the word.  And his own word.  Despereaux agrees to find out the end of the story for Princess Pea, but when he realizes she's in trouble, he's vowed to rescue her as well.

I'll leave the rest of the story to you.  ""Despereaux"" is a beautifully drawn family cartoon with an all-star cast.  It's suitable for all ages, but some dungeon scenes made the littlest audience members cry.

3413067,5,B00188NXN4,"*Spoiler Alert. A request was made to add this for people who don't like to see storyline*

My daughter wanted to see this film.  Probably because the ads showed a cute mouse. We had never heard of this book so I can't judge the story.

The qualities of the stories are simple.  Mistakes, redemption, pure of heart, honor, etc.

The movie opens with a ship heading to a city. On it is Roscuro the rat.  Wearing cloths and an ear ring he looks forward for the famous Soup of the day of the kingdom of Dor.  Wandering through the city he accidentally finds himself in the royal hall as the royal family are first to try the soup.  Too entranced with the smell; Roscuro falls into the Queens soup and she is shocked to see a Rat, suffers a heart attack and dies.  The guards chase him and he eventally falls into a drainage where he lands in Ratworld.  There he is discovered by Botticelli who befriends him and decides to teach him the proper ways of being a Rat.

The grieving king then declares no more soup and rats are outlawed and any who harbor them will be punished.

Despereaux is born in mouseworld.  He is not a typical mouse.  Smaller then normal and he has over-sized ears.  What's worst is that he doesn't cower, run, and he likes to take the cheese from mouse traps. His parents are called into school and told he is about to fail since he does not cower from knives and he draws pictures of cats.  Even names one fluffy.  The school master suggests that Despereaux follow his brother who graduated and was a proper mouse and could teach by example.

They head off to the library where Despereaux is supposed to eat books but instead he starts reading them and learns about knights, honor and questing to save the fair princess.  This eventually takes him to the Princess Peas room where he befriends her as she is curious by his gentlemanly ways.

Eventually, Desperaux is found out and he is punished as he has gone too far by talking to a human.

He is sent to Ratword where no mouse ever returns.  The rats find him and toss him into a Colosseum where he is to be sacrificed to a cat.

Roscuro notices him and sees that he is different.  He decides to save him by declaring he wants to eat him.  Botticelli, leader of the rats, agrees as he had been unhappy with Roscuro since he was refusing to eat flesh.

In Roscuro's room, Despereaux tells Roscuro about knights, chivalry and his quest to save the princess.  Roscuro recognizes the princess is the very girl whose mother he caused to die and decides to help as he may get a chance of redemption by telling her he is sorry.

I could go on but I don't want to completely spoil the film.  Overall I liked the film as the hero really doesn't solve all problems.  It's more cause and effect that guides the story.  The actions of one affect another.  Happiness is lost and as the narrator says a hero appears when most needed.  Despereaux is the hero and he actions effects others and causes actions which cause the return of happiness.

The cast is excellent.  Sigourney Weaver does a great job as the narrator.  Matthew Broderick as Despereaux and Dustin Hoffman as Roscuro.  Emma Watson as the princess(though I must admit I thought was Emily Watson).  Tracey Ullman as Miggery Sow.  Kevin Kline as Andre the soup master.  Ciaran Hinds as Botticelli(though I must admit I thought Peter O'Toole would have been better).

Visually the film is beautiful and the music adds to experience in the right ways.

Violence wise it's pretty safe.  There is fighting but you don't see things like stabbing, etc.  It can be intense especially with the Rat chases and the rat gladiatorial scenes but it's not too bad.  My girl is sensitive but she only wanted a little comfort but she still kept her eyes on the screen.

My daugher wants to see it again as it's a great film in her opinion and I think it's was worth the theater price.  My daughter has already declared we have to obtain the film when it goes to DVD.",1229731200,41,3971,4.4287690179806365
3413068,4,B00188NXN4,"""The Tale of Despereaux"" is terrific family entertainment, a computer animated fable that's not only visually striking, but also solidly structured. I can't make any comparisons to Kate DiCamillo's book, seeing as I haven't read it. Not that it matters a great deal. Movies stand apart from books, no matter how faithful they may be. All I know is that the film is an absolute delight from beginning to end, charming and funny, fun and meaningful, populated by characters that function as recognizable archetypes (and this is despite the fact that many of them are rodents). It essentially tells the story of three outcasts and the events that link them together, one a mouse, one a rat, and one a human. As they move towards their own personal happily ever afters, it becomes clear that it's just as much an internal journey as it is external.

The wonderful narration, provided by Sigourney Weaver, sets up the story. In the picturesque kingdom of Dor, the one day that's even bigger than Christmas is Soup Day, when the King's chef, Andre (voiced by Kevin Kline), unveils his newest culinary concoction. For miles around, the air is permeated with the heavenly aroma of soup. No one is drawn to it more than Roscuro (voiced by Dustin Hoffman), a rat who traveled to Dor with his seafaring best friend, a human named Pietro (voiced by Charles Shaughnessy). Roscuro is not like other rats; not only does he prefer being out in sunlight, he's also honest, and he appreciates crumbs as opposed to scraps of dead flesh. Unfortunately, his love of regular food gets him into a great deal of trouble. When he sneaks into the castle to get closer to the soup, he winds up in the royal dining hall and falls into the Queen's tureen. The sight of him is so shocking that the Queen suffers a heart attack and dies.

Grief stricken, the King decrees that soup be banished from Dor. This plunges the kingdom into a gloomy, barren state where it neither rains nor shines. And as for rats, they're now considered criminals and must retreat into the darkness. This includes Roscuro, who was left behind. After falling down a drain and landing in the castle's dungeon, he meets Botticelli (voiced by Ciarn Hinds), who looks like a rat version of Nosferatu; he takes Roscuro under his wing with the intent to brainwash him, turning him away from sunlight and honesty.

Here enters a puny mouse named Despereaux (voiced by Matthew Broderick), who was born with gigantic ears and wide-open eyes. He lives in a world that actually enforces fear--passing or failing in school depends on whether or not a mouse will cower at the sight of a knife. Much to the chagrin of his parents (William H. Macy and Frances Conroy), his teachers, and the entire mouse population, nothing seems to scare little Despereaux. When he's taken into the royal library to learn how to eat books, he actually begins reading one of them; it's an adventurous tale of a brave knight whose quest is to save the fair princess. This leads him to the chamber of Princess Pea (voiced by Emma Watson), who only wants everything to go back to the way it was. She and Despereaux quickly become friends, something that doesn't go unnoticed by the mouse community. For breaking the law against coming into contact with humans, Despereaux is banished into the castle's dungeon with the rats.

There's a third subplot involving a servant girl named Miggery Sow (voiced by Tracy Ullman), who was sold by her uncle. Miggery would like nothing more than to be a princess, although her stature wouldn't allow it; whenever she sees the crown on Pea's head, she always wonders what it would be like to wear it. Through a series of events I won't reveal, she meets Roscuro, who feels so hurt that he convinces her to kidnap Pea and bring her into the dungeon, where hungry rats await in the shadows. It's now up to Despereaux to be the noble, valiant hero he read about in his favorite book.

This story wouldn't be anywhere near as wonderful were it not for the film's extraordinary look. It actually seemed as if it came off the pages of a fairy tale, with its bold lighting and subdued colors and naturalistic settings. Even entirely fantastic locations are believable, probably because the filmmakers understood how important they are to the development of the characters. Consider the opposing appearances of Mouseworld and Ratworld: located behind a wall in the castle's kitchen, Mouseworld is quaint and colorful, a mishmash of hollowed out books and broken crockery; Ratworld, on the other hand, is shadowy and sinister, made of rotted wood planks and discarded bones.

There is, however, one major drawback to this movie. Two scenes feature Andre arguing with a man named Boldo (voice by Stanley Tucci), who magically builds himself out of vegetables. Even within the context of this story, where talking rodents are considered real, there is absolutely no explanation for this character or his magic. Some have speculated that Boldo is a figment of Andre's imagination, sort of like a manifestation of his conscience. But that can't be; at a certain point, Despereaux interacts with this character. How could he and Andre share the same imagination? Were it not for this one mistake, ""The Tale of Despereaux"" would be right up there with the best animated film of 2008, ""WALL-E."" Fortunately, the vast majority of ""Despereaux"" gets everything right, from the animation to the voices to the messages of individuality and redemption.",1229731200,5,5477,4.833688699360341

8268880,3,B00188NXN4,"This is the story of a very cute itty-bitty mouse with big ears who is constantly in jeopardy, continuously threatened, banished, and headed for execution.  This is something akin to the Brothers Grimm.  It all starts on soup day.  The drama involves a crazy chef, a vegetable man, a rat, and a dead queen.  After that everything turns bleak.  Soup and rats are banned, and a miserable drought sets in.  This story is almost based on the book of the same name by Kate DiCamillo.
The artwork is exquisite, pity the same cant be said of the didactic story and the overuse of too many name actors with overly familiar voices that didn't suit the characters.  This was more a tale of desperation and too many cooks.  The first director was unceremoniously fired.  There was a second director who also didn't make it to the end.  The third director didn't even bother to read the book ANDhe reportedly directed the film from a different location via speakerphone and email!
