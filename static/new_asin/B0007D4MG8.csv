8046906,4,B0007D4MG8,"Once upon a time, there was a little duck who dreamed of falling in love and to dance with her prince. But for the poor duck, it was not meant to be because...well, duck is a duck.

  Until a bizarre old man gives the duck a pendant that changes the duck to a girl.

  The girl, named Duck is given a chance but needs to follow the old man's order.  That is to help the prince who appears to lack emotions, find pieces of his heart in order to bring happiness to the prince.

  And with a special power of turning into Princess Tutu who has the power to unite the shards to the prince's heart.

  All things seem to go well until you find out that Duck's presence as a girl also has its caveats.  If Duck is to ever act like a duck, she will change to a duck (that is until she finds water and she'll change back to a girl).

  The first volume (episode 1-5) featured Duck as she does what she can to help the prince.  The first episode serves as introduction to main characters and the supporting characters of the series. As well as showing the characters passion for ballet.

  In this second volume of PRINCESS TUTU, we are introduced to the crow princess Kraehe.

  Where Tutu's goal was to obtain all shards to restore Prince Mytho's heart (more or less his emotions).  Princess Kraehe will do what it takes to prevent Tutu from accomplishing her goal.

  What everyone doesn't know is that the evil Princess Kraehe is in fact, Prince Mytho's girlfriend, Rue.

  To make matters worse, Mytho's protector Fakir is even more determined to stop Tutu and Kraehe from accomplishing their goals and keep Mytho's heart shattered to pieces to protect him from the two.

  So, the second volume continues to focus on Tutu trying to obtain the shards but more insight on Rue and Fakir and their role in why Mytho is the way he is.

  Both the Japanese and English dubbing are well done.  I'm a bit more biased towards the Japanese version, only because the English voices for Mytho and Fakir sound a bit older for their characters.

  As for special features, included is ""Ballet for Beginners"", ""Erude"", outtakes, in the studio, clean opening and closing animation, reversable cover and a commentary insert by executive director, Junichi Sato.

  All in all, PRINCESS TUTU is a beautiful, enjoyable anime that both children and adults can enjoy.  Definitely an anime series worth checking out.",1220400000,,2390,4.546099290780142

8046908,5,B0007D4MG8,"""May those who accept their fate be granted happiness.  May those who defy it be granted glory.""

These are the words that the mysterious Edel echoes throughout this beautiful tale.

What is the fate of Duck, to vanish as Princess Tutu and never be able to confess her love to her prince?  Will she just be satisfied with simply giving Mytho back his heart and his smile?

What of the prince's will, does he even want his heart back, for as we see in this second dvd, as of yet, all the shards have only made Mytho suffer.

There is Rue, who loves the prince as he is...what shall she do with this changing Mytho who's eyes seem to only reflect Princess Tutu?

And finally the dark Fakir, who wonders if he must ""accept fate without trembling...trembling!""  What is his fate?

Everytime we think there is an answer, more questions arise, in the characters and in out own selves.  Who is right, and who is wrong?  Continue living a puppet's life, constantly being pulled by invisible strings?

I am sitting on the edge of my seat, anticipating the third volume of this most intricate tale.  I hope you too get the same experience.",1133049600,4,1129,4.502463054187192

[...]

This dvd will be awesome, I have seen the episodes in Japanese, so I can't wait to see the dub of it...The dub is awesome, they picked great VA's for the characters...now If only ADV would come to their senses and pick up the rights to dub Cardcaptor Sakura, 'cause I think they could dub it WAY better than Nelvana did...

I just hope that they're going to have some great specials on the upcoming dvds of Princess Tutu..",1125446400,7,535,4.2772277227722775
