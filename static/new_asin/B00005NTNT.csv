7947849,5,B00005NTNT,"Clint Eastwood is probably the best actor and director of our time.
I have watched all of his entire history of movies in which he act and directs
He no foubt has a sense of what needs to be told
Morgan Freeman is also a excellent narrator.
this set is great and should be bought by all who love Clint and admire his talent be it film or music
I Just watched J Edgar and really enjoyed it The acting was great  and the way Clint Eastwood directed it and ofcourse Clint wrote the music.
They don't come any better.

7947850,5,B00005NTNT,"I would like to give these 5 stars to Dina Ruiz Eastwood, because of the love and dedication she shares to his ex husband. I have been beloved wife and had 15 years marriage, we managed to avoid the split, but still I became a widow  within 30 minutes. As a journalist I founded such a column myself in a journal I was editing, because in Estonia we have a plenty of persons, who deserve to come out of the shadow. Dina chose an angel to portrait Clint through his work. But I would like to see Clint, when he is not on a set, where he became a director and an actor. Because the tragedy to the actor is, when his grizzled charisma remains in the memories of the associates and his roles become the memories of the memories. And I would n't like that. That is why I like to add some personal touch. This pure american soul and an american rebel is having the british roots. He becomes from the old aristocratic family and they were one of the first settlers, who landed in USA. The surname Eastwood becomes from the name Answald, which is an old German one and means "" a divine power"", and also an old English Osweald "" a good ruler"". His first love is music and I am married to history, but we both are playing piano. He likes the old movies. We have two of the favorites actors in common, Cooper and Bogart. We both like AKi Kurosawa.  And we both like a cool beer, my favorite is actually metheglin. The golf is not my game, I admit. but this is his passion, I guess, after jazz. My daughter speaks Estonian sometimes like Clint american English, like having a hot potato in the mouth. It is so funny and loverly and makes me laugh.  Lennie Niehaus has composed a musical portrait of Clint, which maybe tells you more about him and the first part of it carries a title ""Out of the shadows"", which were created specially for to this documentary. And I like that.",1388275200,,1864,4.259887005649717

7947853,4,B00005NTNT,"You know who you are. Maybe (like me) you recall him from his early days on television. I was a kid then but I remember how handsome he was, so rugged, so mysterious.
  What I've always found fascinating about Eastwood is how people didn't foresee the fact that this man had staying power, that he could be more than a stereotype (although I think he allowed himself to be stereotyped for awhile and made big bucks doing so; not the dumbest move around).
  Watch this documentary, though, and try to think beyond the comments of the reviewers. They have worthwhile points but take them as a starting point for reflecting on Eastwood's career and about when he veered from Westerns and Dirty Harry type roles to even more daring movies. He has continued to evolve from actor to director and...what takes my breath away and serves as inspiration for me...is how, at his age, he is able to stay on top of the game, with the chops to direct Mystic River and Million Dollar Baby. I think he's surprised even himself but that, of course, is just a wild guess.
  Anyway, this documentary is a must for Eastwood fans and will provide new facts as well, even for those who think they know it all, as well as a divergence of opinions (feel free to disagree with any or all of them). After watching this, do your own research or just go back and go through his films from the early years onward. While you are at it, get a track of Sergio Leone music (just trust me on that one; see below):

7947854,4,B00005NTNT,"I have recently regained my interest in Clint after re-watching Unforgiven again. It really is such a perfect film. So I got a copy of OUT OF THE SHADOWS to learn more about him (as I found most of the biography books way too dry). The doco is well paced and informative. It covers most of his films in alot of detail. Its first half is dedicated to him as an actor and the second half's focus is on his directing. I enjoed this half the most, a new director like myself could learn alot from old Clint. He is a very gentle and quiet director, who lets his actors find their character without stepping in too much. He is very matter of fact and down to the point and he just loves films. Like when he was being directed by Segio Leone and Don Siegel, unlike most actors, he never left the set because there was way too much to learn from watching these great directors work.
This DVD is great not only as a source of information on such an inspiring man, but also as a wealth of tips on how to direct.
I only deduct one star because there is not enough interviews with the mystery man himself and because I wanted to see way more of him actually working on his films (instead of finished famous scenes from his films).
This man deserves way more acknowledgement from the Oscars. They should definantly give him an honarary life time acheivement award real soon. Because whether he's acting or directing, nobody in film, can say so much with so little words.",1018224000,25,1457,4.34065934065934
