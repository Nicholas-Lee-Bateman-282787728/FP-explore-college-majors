3772403,1,B001R123WE,"I loved the Muppets Show.  It IS a trip back in time.  Enjoyable, clean, simple fun with amazingly incredible entertainers behind the each muppet and as guest stars.

But why would you buy this three DVD set for over $120 when you can by the 3 DVDs separately for under $75?  $50 for a box to hold the three?  LOL  LOL LOL  LOL  LOL  Someone's being had!!!!!",1336262400,24,358,4.223880597014926
3772404,4,B001R123WE,"THE MUPPET SHOW: After a long tenure as one of SESAME STREET's most charming stars, everyman KERMIT THE FROG was promoted to host THE MUPPET SHOW, a slightly more adult oriented, wildly entertaining ""behind the scenes"" variety series populated by quirky, colorful new characters. Headed by creator JIM HENSON and FRANK OZ, the enormous cast included heckling curmudgeons STATLER & WALDORF, hip house band DR. TEETH & THE ELECTRIC MAYHEM, bad one liner king FOZZIE BEAR, piano pounder ROWLF THE DOG (a holdover from the old JIMMY DEAN show), and KERMIT's main squeeze, irrespressible scene hogger MISS PIGGY. Purposely stale puns, madcap musical productions, and skewed skits like PIGS IN SPACE and VETERINARIAN'S HOSPITAL were trotted out weekly, along with a who's who of big name singers, comedians, broadway and film legends, and dancers. STEVE MARTIN, ELTON JOHN, CAROL BURNETT, ZERO MOSTEL, LIBERACE, RITA MORENO, VINCENT PRICE, JOHN CLEESE, ALICE COOPER, and PETER SELLERS were just a few of the over 100 celebrity guests who lined up to take their knocks and swap one liners. For five frantic, flambouyant, fun-filled seasons, no man, woman, or child was safe from MUPPET mayhem...not that anyone wanted to be.

RATING: FOUR FELT STARS",1325030400,7,1242,5.21
3772405,2,B001R123WE,bad price its half the cost to buy each season separate these bundles are supposed to be cheaper deals not much more expensive,1322784000,24,126,4.521739130434782
3772406,4,B001R123WE,Great show remimds me when it was on when I was a kid. Its a great product I didn't rember over half tof the gust stars on the show so it was good to finly put a name to a face with a lot of them.,1303430400,,196,3.282608695652174
3772407,5,B001R123WE,"Very interesting. I remember watching the shows in the 70's as a way to be entertained and to relax after teaching junior high students all day. I decided that it would be fun to see them again. Times have changed since then. I didn't find them as funny as before but still enjoyed them. A trip back in time is usually just that, a trip back in times sans the same feelings. But, it seemed that it made a hit with my college nephew who laughed out loud during many of the skits. So, maybe the fun times have been passed on.",1265414400,13,523,4.137254901960785
3772448,5,B001R123WE,Wonderful show. Brand new set. Perfect!,1451088000,,39,5.666666666666667
3772449,1,B001R123WE,"I love the old Muppet show! It's clever, funny and enjoyable for the whole family.  Frankly the Muppets just have not been the same since Jim Henson passed away! IMO: The new Muppet show just isn't very good. I recommend anyone buy these older versions...they hold up even if the kids don't know the guest stars!  However, I'd steer clear of buying this particular set of 3!
If you buy each season separately, as of 11/28/15 I came up with only $34.15 total, Season 1 is only listed at $8.95, Season 2 $13.22, Season 3 $11.98!  If you have Prime you don't even have to pay shipping...so....save yourself some money this holiday season!

This set is now $65. as of 11/13/15! Honestly! What in the world is Amazon thinking? How is it so much more to buy them in a set? According other customer reviews it's not even in special packaging.",1448668800,3,835,4.509933774834437

Loved the special feature ""Muppets on Puppets"" on Season-3.",1412121600,,306,4.464285714285714

3772467,1,B001R123WE,"OK, the original Muppet Show is a piece of iconic history, and made back when Jim Henson was still alive, so it was actually GOOD (unlike the stuff made post-Jim Henson), but, if you buy seasons 1-3 separately, you're spending under $65. If you buy this, you're spending nearly $100. That doesn't make any sense whatsoever. ::P",1344470400,6,327,4.754385964912281

Very disappointed but at least the DVD's all work. The description needs to be updated and or the product image as it is very misleading.
