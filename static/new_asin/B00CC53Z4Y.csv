5714157,5,B00CC53Z4Y,I was curious would this CD be what I needed.  It is!  It's just what I wanted and is helping me to undertake my own self-guided transformation!  Thanks,1375747200,13,152,4.357142857142857
5714158,5,B00CC53Z4Y,"This was a workout DVD that really got me sweating! I really liked the differing levels of challenge on this as it allows you - wherever you are starting to be able to either jump in completely or slowly. Realize though that this DVD will challenge you and will make you work for the outcomes that you want, but it is worth it. Also, the exercises were fun and varied which kept my interest as well.

I thought Chris Powell did a great job and if the results of some of the people using this DVD are any indication, you can definitely slim down by staying with the program and watching what you are eating.

I truly am enjoying this DVD and the exercises within, and recommend it to others as well as a great addition to your own workout!

I'm super sore today. It's a great kick your butt workout but you're having fun while doing it because Chris is SO nice and funny to listen too.",1466208000,4,311,4.288135593220339
5714166,5,B00CC53Z4Y,"I love my new Boot Camp DVD with Chris Powell! I like the many options available for working out with this DVD. I enjoy working out with the instructor, since Chris is very encouraging and motivating. He does a great job explaining the proper technique for the exercises and you have the option of using the beginner technique or the more advanced technique with Heidi. The warm-up is great for preparing your body to work out and the cool-down helps relax all those tired muscles. I really like the quick repetitions and the fact that we move from one exercise right into another, it keeps me from getting burned out and bored with my exercise routine. The best part is there are four levels of workouts, so as you progress, you can just move on to the more difficult level without purchasing a new DVD. You can also combine workouts to mix up your routine. I will definitely purchase more workout DVDs with Chris Powell.",1466035200,4,922,4.593939393939394

5714168,4,B00CC53Z4Y,I used quite a few at home dad's when I was losing weight. This was one of my favorites and still is almost 100 pounds later. Use it and try your hardest,1465257600,3,153,3.8125
5714169,5,B00CC53Z4Y,I'm an avid Extreme Makeover fan so I was anxious to get and try this DVD.  Chris Powell has done an excellent job of producing a workout DVD that can be used by all fitness levels.  I've been using it faithfully for about 6 weeks now and it never gets boring for me.,1462147200,,267,4.018867924528302
5714170,5,B00CC53Z4Y,Good,1461456000,,4,4.0
5714171,5,B00CC53Z4Y,I am a huge fan of Chris and Heidi Powell! This workout is a step up if you are ready for something different. It's challenging but fun and is split up into 3 different levels of intensity. It is definitely worth what I paid for it and arrived right on time!,1458000000,,258,4.078431372549019

5714173,5,B00CC53Z4Y,"This is a good DVD for beginners--and I say that with a few caveats.  I am very fond of the level two, three and four work outs--especially the fourth one.  I am absolutely in love with that level four work out--it's just absolutely ferocious!  You can push yourself as hard as you want to or take it easy--and I tell you what, it's pretty exciting to stay on level with Heidi Powell!  I am not a fan of the level one work out.  I do not think it's a level one work out in the slightest!  In my opinion, a minute and a half of plank, seventy-three squats and forty back lunges is NOT beginner!  The seventy-three squats especially are difficult and would be very difficult for a beginner.  This DVD is also pretty dry.  I do all four work outs in a row and there's a lot of the same thing--that can get pretty boring after awhile.  I would say that this is a good DVD for someone who is intermediate.  It is very motivating to watch those who've lost weight complete this work out.  Their form is not always great though--keep in mind!  I'm also not a fan of how many cuts there are in this DVD--often I was trying to match Heidi and it's not helpful when I'm watching a super close close-up on Alex.  Also the room they are working out in seems bizarrely small?  They are all cramped in there.

This is a great weight-free work out.  I definitely have seen results, I just got a bit bored after awhile!",1454284800,,1403,4.233962264150944

5714187,4,B00CC53Z4Y,"It has some good features with weights, etc.  It has multiple workouts that you can customize to your needs.  Also, of course even if you master one of the levels, changing weights will make it a new one next time.

The only thing I have a problem with is the sound on my DVD....Sometimes the music drowns out the instructions..too bad it's not Bob's voice every now and then. LOL I have enjoyed this DVD and am glad I have it in my exercise regime.",1427068800,,449,4.258823529411765

5714195,4,B00CC53Z4Y,I like it. It was worth buying.,1413158400,,31,3.5714285714285716
5714196,5,B00CC53Z4Y,"The thing that attracted me to this video is that it contains people of different body types.  Rather than watch several in-shape people show me how to exercise, I much prefer seeing people like me that are still in the process of reaching their goals.  Each person in the video does slightly modified versions of the exercises, reflecting their individual level of fitness.  This is a big advantage the video has over the others ones I have tried.  I believe it encourages people of all fitness levels to complete the exercises as best as they can.

If you are really out of shape, I don't think you will find these exercises to be easy.  You will probably need a couple of weeks before you can comfortably complete the warm up, level one program, and cool down.

I really like Chris Powell's personality and his presentation.  I plan to purchase more of his videos and books.",1412899200,4,877,4.612903225806452
5714197,1,B00CC53Z4Y,I guess this DVD is for those who have NEVER worked out before. The instructions given are so simplistic and Chris seems to be kind of talking down to the viewer. I didn't even go through the entire DVD.,1411516800,,203,4.230769230769231

5714212,5,B00CC53Z4Y,"I love Extreme Makeover & Chris Powell's positivity.  I was not disappointed with this DVD.  I have tried / bought tons of work out DVD's, and either end up uninterested, lost at the pace, or bored.  I completely engaged with the workouts offered & moderation levels, I can feel every part of my body being engaged.  Chris is very motivating, and it's nice to have average people (from the show too!) doing the same workouts I am, taking breaks, not feeling worse about myself looking at some skinny little thing in a skimpy workout outfit that I can't keep up with.  Highly recommended for those just starting your journey, for days you can't get to the gym, or just to get your body moving for 15 mins a day.  Well worth it.",1397520000,5,726,4.462121212121212

5714245,1,B00CC53Z4Y,I don't like this video as much as his first one.  He focuses more on his wife and how wells she does her advance moves.  Well not everyone is in advance moves.  He does not fully explain the moves as he did in the first one.  I work out to the first video almost everyday.,1376092800,8,273,3.909090909090909

5714247,4,B00CC53Z4Y,I have currently lost 80 pounds with a goal loss of 120 pounds. Chris Powell's first DVD was one of the first in my library. I always wished for additional ones because I enjoy his training style in encouraging attitude. The first DVD was great when I was a beginner and it helped get me off the couch and start moving. I was really hoping this one would be a step up and nice add on to this first DVD. I found this one to be as changeling as the first which now after a year of workout 5 times a week is not changeling enough. If you are looking for a good starter disc you can't go wrong with this or the first Extreme Makeover Weightloss Edidtion DVD,1376006400,47,653,4.069767441860465
5714248,5,B00CC53Z4Y,"I loved this dvd! I have *some* experience with working out and it still completely wore me out. It's got a good warmup and cool down section & I love that the actual workout is scalable since there are many different levels. You can do as much as you're able to.
Definitely recommend this dvd!",1375920000,22,294,4.363636363636363
