8421517,4,B004B4RPC2,"I admit to being a little biased since I'm involved in the project featured in this documentary. However, I found it to be very professionally produced and covered all of the main aspects of the project. I sat down expecting to just glance through it and ended up watching the whole thing from start to finish. It pulled me right in.",1293494400,,333,4.475409836065574
8421518,5,B004B4RPC2,"Rarely is it possible to observe ordinary people doing extraordinary research in modern astromony, but this is exactly the point in this most wonderful documentary, ""Mystery in the Sky"".  The filmmaker takes you on a great adventure, led by the Citizen Sky Project on the hunt for an enigma hidden deep in the heavens. The experiences of these amatuer astronomers charting a pathway to find the mystery will delight, inform, and astonish you with their passion and observation skills, which are badly needed in this growing field of astronomical research. If Space is the last frontier, it is good to know that inquisitive minds here on Earth are ready to go to the outer limits of 21 century science. Great gift for children wanting to know more.......",1291075200,,753,4.929133858267717
8421519,5,B004B4RPC2,"Mystery in the Sky had us riveted. We had no idea that ""citizen scientists"" existed and that there are international cooperative ventures to solve scientific mysteries. We learned a great deal about stars...this would be great to share with children 12 and older who show an interest in astronomy. The narrative is clear and informative and the quality of the video is excellent. This DVD would make an unexpected and welcome Christmas present for those who take an interest in science and enjoy furthering their knowledge base.",1290384000,,528,5.080459770114943
8421520,5,B004B4RPC2,"This is a well done story of the scientific study of epsilon aurigae -a variable star-and the need for amateurs to help w ith home observations. This is a very interesting star system which is visible to the naked eye, even in city environments which happens to dim every 27 years! No one knows exactly why. It is currently in the dim cycle and much work needs to be done to get data which may explain what is happening. Even visual comparisons by amateurs are needed so citizens are asked to join citizen sky web site and contribute to this study. The DVD does a nice job of explaining the possible star system involved, how far away the stars are, and what is already known about the system along with some discussions of the scientific method and the fun involved with amateur astronomy. There are some beautiful computer simulations and discussions with professional astronomers about the help amateurs can give and the theories that are now being presented to explain current data. People without a telescope who live in cities without dark skies can help with real science. It is exciting! Go on the web and look at AAVSO. American association of variable star observers - or go to citizen sky-a web site just for this science project to find out more. The DVD is worth the price to those with any interest in the stars.",1289865600,,1326,4.622881355932203
8421521,5,B004B4RPC2,"""Mystery in the Sky"" is about how amateur astronomers, any people interested in stars, can help scientists unravel the mystery of a particular star by pooling their observations.  The video explains concepts in astronomy so clearly that I came away with a much greater understanding of basic ideas in astronomy that I thought I understood. Even if you don't have a telescope, this video lets you enjoy the wonders of the star-filled sky from the comfort of a cozy chair.",1289520000,,470,4.875
