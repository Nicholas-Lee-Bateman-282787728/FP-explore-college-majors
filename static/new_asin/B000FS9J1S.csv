8125991,5,B000FS9J1S,"I did not know what to expect from an old Bollywood film.  And since it is a ""play on words"" if you will...with the Vedic shadow planets of Rahu and Ketu.  Yes it is campy...the soundtrack , the acting, the sets and the four song and dance numbers that break up the drama of the story.
But you know what ?  I really liked it !  It is a great escapism and I must say the song and dance numbers (that are the stock and trade of most Bollywood films past and present)  are really fun to watch and the tunes are catchy.  And the ladies saris and costumes are sparkly and attention-getting.  There was not any reviews on this film--so I thought I would try my hand at it.  It is about two corrupt officials in a country village who have been committing crimes and accepting bribes and being bad.  The complaints from the villagers are getting the attention of the government and they send a handsome and not-so-easy to seduce and corrupt police officer to investigate.  There is lots of action and campy villains.  One villain does triple time in different disguises---he is fun to watch.  I do not want to give away anymore info to spoil it for you.
