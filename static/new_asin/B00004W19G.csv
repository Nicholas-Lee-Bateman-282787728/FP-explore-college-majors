1359203,5,B00004W19G,"My main interest in Erich von Stroheim's 1922 silent film classic ""Foolish Wives"" is in the use of lavish background sets and the glittering costumes which represent Monte Carlo in the 1920's.
  I was surfing through TV channels and came upon the Turner Classic movie already in progress.  As I watched the rich black and white images, it seemed as if I were looking at an album of old photographs which came to life.
  I'm buying a copy of this movie because I'm intrigued by the furniture, the use of everyday articles of the 1920's, and the formal dress.  And, hey, it's not a bad story, either!",989193600,10,598,4.542056074766355
1359204,4,B00004W19G,"In 1922, Universal Pictures commissioned Erich von Stroheim to direct, write, and star in ""Foolish Wives"". His first film, ""Blind Husbands"",was quite a hit. His second film, ""Devil's Passkey"", has turned to dust. Prof. Arthur Lennig has edited the clearest scenes from 2 Italian versions of this ancient classic, and for the first time you may see and own the most complete edition of ""Foolish Wives"" in startling DVD. Green and orange sepia toned sequences alter the mood and story. ""Foolish Wives"" opens with von Stroheim munching on real caviar and Russian cigarettes as he gazes out of his oceanside chateau with his two female consorts. This begins his story of a bogus European count out to defraud and seduce unwary American tourists' wives. The first film to sport a Million Dollar budget, von Stroheim reconstructed an authentic replica of the Monte Carlo casino on the Universal back lot. A tour of Universal Studios today reveals no trace of this once famous set. I recommend this tale of kinky sex and mild debauchery as it winds down to a surprise ending. Just three years later, he directed ""Greed"" at MGM. It is now considered among the one-or-two greatest films of alltime. Eventually, Hollywood studios barred Erich von Stroheim from directing any more lavish, expensive epics.  They said his style was over-rated. They've been copying and re-inventing it ever since.",977356800,41,1384,5.043668122270742
1359205,5,B00004W19G,"Erich Von Stroheim was an absolute genius and brought the art of movie making to new heights. In a time when many films consisted of room shots with the individuals in frame overacting to compensate for the lack of sound, Stroheim was developing complex characters, plot twists and subtle nuances. He understood that a certain look, movement of the eyes, or quick smile could tell an audience more about a character than 10 title cards.
""Foolish Wives"" is genuinely wonderful film that shows Erich Von Stroheim at one of his best moments; Not only writing & directing, but starring in the film itself as a hoaxing opportunist very much addicted to using women and very much in need of money. He finds a vulnerable woman that allows him to begin weaving his web of seduction over her emotional and financial state.
""Foolish Wives"" is an excellent film, compared to silents and talkies alike, ""Foolish Wives"" holds it's own.",970963200,19,922,4.841772151898734

7924368,5,B00004W19G,"Stroheim was a unique filmmaker and actor.  The setting is Monte Carlo in 1921 with Stroheim, Gladys George and Mae Busch as frauds and blackmailers.  The foolish wife is fooled by Stroheim's masquerade as a poor, but noble, Russian officer.
She comes close to being seduced but escapes and learns the true value of her husband.  The film is a more complex follow up to Blind Husbands, 1919.",1386806400,2,391,4.720588235294118
7924369,5,B00004W19G,"They called him ""the man you loved to hate,"" and that might have been the feeling that some moviegoers had for director Erich Von Stroheim. And that was for sure the feeling that some movie executives had for him, especially the legendary Irving Thalberg, who some consider the best producer ever. The majestic and delightful ""Foolish Wives"" is a testament of Von Stroheim's appetite for big budgets and out-of-control behavior, the ones that he was famous for. However, it is also a testament of his grandiosity as both an actor and director. Referred to as the ""first million-dollar picture,"" ""Foolish Wives"" is now available in a glorious Blu-ray edition, thanks to the folks at Kino-Lorber.

The film opens in Monte Carlo -- ""Europe's playground"" --, and we are immediately taken to Villa Amo Rosa, ""secluded and leased for the season by three members of the Russian aristocracy (or so we are told):  Princess Olga Petchnikoff (Maude George), Princess Vera Petchnikoff (Mae Busch), and their cousin, Count Wladislaw Sergius Karamzin (also a Captain in the Russian Army)."" They also have a maid, Maruschka (Dale Fuller), who is clandestinely in love with Count Karamzin. They live an apparent idyllic life - caviar for breakfast--, but in the underneath, they are in desperate need of money. Enter Mr. and Mrs. Andrew Hughes (Rudolph Christians and Miss Dupont, respectively), who would be arriving to Monaco, with Mr. Hughes being the commissioner plenipotentiary from the United States. Mr. Hughes would be meeting Monaco's officials to present them with his credentials.  Count Karamzin immediately sees an opportunity there, and eventually befriends them, with the objective of conquering Mrs, Hughes' heart (and money), telling them that he wanted to be a ""kind protector"" to them. He and his cousins also want to secure respect and status in Monaco's high society. Count Karamzin is a playboy, and dresses as Captain in the Russian Army (a mania that Von Stroheim had in most of his pictures; he claimed to have been and officer in his native Austrian army), stating, ""I think I'll enjoy this undertaking."" And enjoy he did, playing the part perfectly until the very end.

For ""Foolish Wives"" von Stroheim, constructed an impressive and expensive set in the Universal lot, recreating luxurious Monaco, and he filmed 21 reels during its production in 1921, for which Thalberg ordered one third cut, and then one half. The Kino Blu-ray features the 1972 restored version from the American Film Institute. This is the best and almost complete edition of this film available. If you are a fan of silent movies, and of von Stroheim in particular, this is a must-have for any reason that you can think about - cinematic history at its best. The Blu-ray also includes the very complete and informative documentary ""The Man you loved to hate,"" audio commentary by Valerie von Stroheim and Paul Kohner, New York Censor Board cuts (yes, von Stroheim was racy), and much more. (USA, 1922, B&W, 143 min plus additional materials)

7924371,5,B00004W19G,"FOOLISH WIVES is a great old film. Stroheim had a keen eye for the bizarre and for details. This DVD has its flaws
but all in all quite acceptable.",1357862400,,147,4.103448275862069
7924372,3,B00004W19G,"Erich von Stroheim directs and plays Count Wladislaw Sergius Karamzin (Capt. 3rd Hussars Imper. Russian Army). He is very much in love with his dashing persona that is best described as an acquired taste, I think it would have been much more effective to have that much footage on a really talented actor that is also good looking,but that is just a detail. The film is a good film, the characters are interesting and well developed and the scenes are beautifully filmed.
The problem, and it is a problem no matter how much talent we may think von Stronheim had as a director, is the timing. It is an unnecessarily long movie, period. I can totally understand how this became a real challenge later as he thought longer was better and the more expensive the production, the better too. Neither one of these is necessarily true as we know from other great directors.
In all fairness, the length of time has always been endemic to German cultural productions, it is actually one of its most salient characteristics and can be traced all the way back to Goethe's Faust and Wagner's Operas, though I dare say it probably started out from the very beginning in their medieval dramas. The problem ussually starts with confusing and melding two different things which creates a third which is neither. For example with Wagner's operas, there is no question the music is great quality. The problem begins when throwing that content into the structure of a performance: 4 or five hours without interruption is not the usual amount of time people can sit without a bathroom or refreshment break. As far as this perspective is concerned if you can't  take four hours to say it, then it is not worth bothering with, and I for one could not disagree more. Here for example at the very beginning of the film we see the characters in a villa endlessly having breakfast. I mean you have all the time in the world to count the patterns of silk on Count Sergius' silk robe, which I also found overly done and a bit ridiculous.
Then there is the walk he takes with the wife of the American envoy to Monaco (Miss DuPont)  that turns into a total nightmare as they hit a rain storm and when it is raining the hardest Count Sergius takes her into a boat and decides to go across the lake to some hut, where a witch like hag lives with her goats. This entire scene, which is endless, is totally unnecessary, we get to see several long shots of the goats too, as if they were major characters, and of the hag sleeping. In the midst of this a monk stops by and stays with them too, another twenty minutes going nowhere.
The film finally takes off when he tells the American wife to meet him at his villa, where his cousins Maude George as Princess Olga Petchnikoff and Mae Busch as Princess Vera Petchnikoff, who look like Weimar trans-gender women, run a mini casino where they clear  Cesare Ventucci, (Cesare Gravina) a Counterfeiter's bills that he makes for them on a regular basis. The  permanently depressed and abused maid Marushka (Dale Fuller) however has been having an affair with the Count as well, she has even given him her life savings after he has a crocodile tear scene asking her for money, which she consents to do thinking of his (false) promise of marriage. As one of the first vengeful neurotic lovers in film, she sees them through the keyhole and decides to set the place on fire and throw herself to the sea from a cliff later. Both scenes are shown in exhausting detail.
I can totally understand why this movie was heavily edited, but can not begin to comprehend how it could have possibly been longer than this. Suppossedly one of the 'great' ideas was that it reproduced Montecarlo on a Hollywood backlot. Unless they were going to do a series on the Riviera, it would have been better to go there. I now can see why von Sronheim ran into problems with ""Queen Kelly"" and Gloria Swanson as that story started to 'grow'. The word 'cut' must be very difficult to pronounce, or to put in mind in German, which is a shame for there is no question there are great qualities here as well as a lot of talent. I have hear that the original length of his 'masterpiece' ""Greed"" was 9 hours, even cuting it down to two viewings of 4 and 5 hours each is difficult to envision. Who had that much time for a movie then? or now?",1250467200,5,4315,4.507024265644955
7924373,4,B00004W19G,"Very interesting story of deception among the jet set before there was one.
Eric von Stroheim plays a real Count who dishonors his home and visiting country by enlisting two fake cousins in his schemes to extract wealth from Monte Carlo vacationers. When he's not pursuing rich married women, he's ""borrowing"" from the Housekeeper he has promised to marry.
One of the ""cousins"" is Mae Busch in an early role. Known better as ""Mrs. Hardy"" or L & H's nemesis in many Laurel and Hardy films, it's fun to watch her strut her stuff: the character is similiar to the one from ""Chickens Come Home"", from about 10 years later.
Great sets, costumes; interesting camera angles; tintype effect. New musical soundtrack is a solo piano, beautifully incorporated.
Viewer should know that the film conatins some very disturbing racial
content, of course, typical of the period.",1220140800,4,862,4.951724137931034
