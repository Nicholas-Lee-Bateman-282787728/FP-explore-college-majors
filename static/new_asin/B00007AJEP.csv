1804432,4,B00007AJEP,"This video is fun to watch.  There is a lot to learn from Flea and Chad just by watching them.  This is not a ""how-to"" video.  Watch and learn.  During his ""interviews"" with River Phoenix, Flea rambles about how he got into playing the bass and his personal philosophies.  I think this was filmed shortly before River's death, and I think it shows just how bad his drug problem was.  He and Flea look pretty wasted.  The interview is more like a late night conversation you have with a buddy after a long night of drinking or whatever.

It's pretty fun and energizing musically, and I found the interviews pretty hilarious.  It's kind of like Cheech and Chong do the bass.",1156809600,4,672,4.487603305785124
1804433,2,B00007AJEP,"This DVD is primarily Flea's philosophy on music, love, life, etc.  I would consider it more inspirational than instructional. Definately belongs under the philosophy section and not the music instruction section. The few moments of instruction are fairly basic -- thumping, slapping, plucking. All right-hand technique. Flea admits that he can't read music, tabs, etc. So he doesn't really speak to any fretting technique. In fact, he sums up his entire left-hand technique as ""pressing his fingers down on the strings"". You might love this DVD if you're interested in Flea, the musician. You'll be disappointed if you're looking for some significant bass instruction. Instead, I would highly recommend Victor Wooten's Live at Bass Day 1998.",1156204800,2,742,5.396551724137931
1804434,5,B00007AJEP,"OK first off this video is extremely helpful for bass players and i would say anyone really,But this footage here is extremely helpful,yes go for it.",1141516800,3,149,4.769230769230769
1804435,4,B00007AJEP,"If you are looking for an instructional video, this isn't it.  For a few minutes he explains his warm up drills, but most of them should already be familiar to the average player.  He shows the slap and pop drill that he used to learn and perfect the technique, but I found that I wasn't personally able to learn it alone from his short description.

  The value in this video would have to be its insperational aspect.  I'm a (very) new player, and watching him play blew me away.  I came a way from it with a whole list of techniques to go an try to learn on my own.",1139443200,2,568,4.109090909090909
1804436,3,B00007AJEP,"Flea is a great bass player. There's no denying that.
However, most of this DVD is a discussion of his personal philosophy and Flea masking his conciet by transparently false modesty.
I own this DVD and I do watch it, but I can't help but wince at most of his cliched ""advice.""
That being said, watching him play is great, and there are some useful transcriptions in the booklet that accompanies the DVD, which will allow you to have a glimpse at what the guy is doing.
Overall, this is a good DVD, but if you're a bassist looking for an instructional video, look elsewhere.",1048464000,25,574,4.476190476190476
7974720,1,B00007AJEP,One thing to learn is to read all reviews this is a complete waste of money I put it on the same level of terrible as abe laboriels funk dvd nothing taught.  If you want to see this great player do yourself a favor and buy Chad Smiths drum dvd flea is actually much better in that than in this dvd,1508544000,,297,3.8688524590163933
7974721,5,B00007AJEP,amazing what this man has accomplished off the dome,1490400000,,51,4.777777777777778
7974722,5,B00007AJEP,"This is how I learned to play the bass! To hell with the ""bass basics"". Best video ever, Flea and River are gonna take you on a very weird 1.5 hour journey",1453075200,,155,3.875
7974723,5,B00007AJEP,"Let's face the truth.. this man is the greatest bass player of all time, but he's not and will never be a great teacher. thanks for the advice though!",1447545600,,150,4.206896551724138
7974724,1,B00007AJEP,"I paid 1 penny for it (plus the normal shipping from amazon) and I overpaid. my first clue should have been at the start where he's babbling about stuff swirling around in the room he's going to try to make speak. I forgot how weird this dude is. there's more hippy trippy stuff like you have to love who you play with, you have to learn every style, always pour out what you feel. what will you learn on style? NOTHING. you watch him play, with 20 mins left you see slow down a riff. if you're a fanboy get it. if you want to learn something, wrong video",1429660800,,555,4.10091743119266
7974725,3,B00007AJEP,It's so old... I love Flea but damn is this an old VHS to DVD video. I started watching but I haven't finished yet. I'll have to find a more time appropriate vid for me.,1379116800,,169,3.857142857142857
7974726,3,B00007AJEP,"Luckily, I got this dvd after I was pretty good at playing bass. If they hadn't been the case, I would have been pretty mad. You get to see some cool jam sessions with Flea, and he gives some good musical philosophy with River Phoenix (right before he died) but there's a major problem with it: it won't teach you how to play bass.
When Flea actually tries to be instructional, you'll see that he clearly is not a teacher. It does come with a cool tab booklet though, with good warm up exercises.",1247443200,,496,4.287234042553192
7974727,3,B00007AJEP,"Unfortunately, i did not read the review; i usually do! I was looking for an instructional DVD. However, i do not regret buying it. It's cool, with River Pheonix interviewing ect. It's really cool.
I see that ""Lick Library"" has an instructional DVD on Flea and the Red Hot Chili Peppers Bass, so i think i'll buy that one.

I hope that one will be instructional!!!(=",1247097600,,366,4.545454545454546
7974728,5,B00007AJEP,"The first time I watched this video, I thought it was the stupidest thing I'd ever seen.  The second time I watched it, I started hearing what Flea had to say.  He actually has quite a bit of sage advice.  Play every note as if it's your last.  Any sound the bass can make can be part of a spontaneous jam.  Whatever you do, be true, be loving, and don't be lame. <end of quotes>  I make sure to watch it at least once a year as a reminder.  He says he doesn't know theory, but the theory he's picked is as valid as major diatonic harmony.",1225324800,,539,3.9813084112149535
7974729,1,B00007AJEP,"This DVD is not an instructional DVD. You won't learn anything with it. There is few tabs of riffs that Flea is playing in it, but they realy are no use...

This DVD is fun if you would like to see Flea when he was younger and if you like this guy. This inverviewer is boring and looks like he will fall asleep any minute...

If you want to improve your playing, purchase something else. If you wan't to have a good laugh and look some cool jamming that you won't learn to play, this might be for you...",1169942400,2,503,4.070707070707071
