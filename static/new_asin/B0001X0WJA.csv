The days are filled with sunshine, but certain events take place around the city that violently evoke the horrors that were to come as the soviet government gained it's stranglehold on the people.

The film company are awaiting the arrival by train, of the rest of the crew from Moscow. These actors and technicians arrive with tales of delays and restrictions of liberty that previously they have not experienced.

The shooting progresses interruptedly, and in betwwen we learn of the private lives and characters of some of the cast and crew. There are many memorable scenes in this romantic drama that will linger in the mind long after the film is ended.

The ending has an optimistic air, but it is a very uncertain one, as in time we know from history books of the imminent birth of the ussr.",1363478400,,928,4.751552795031056

There is such an amazing blend of rapturous indolence, blissful ignorance and terrifying urgency in this gloriously photographed film. Mikhailkov is indeed a master - on a par with David Lean - as master story teller in cinema. Although his canvases are smaller than Lean's choices, they embody every bit as much, and sometimes more, than the British master.

The performances are flawless - ineffable. The music, too, is so heart-breakingly fused with the images, that truly one cannot think of one without the other.

This is a remarkable, astonishing glimpse of the most powerful country in the world, with a culture at its zenith, imploding upon itself - perceived by a group of individuals at varying degrees of consciousness.

Buy it.

Let it wash over and envelop you.

Try and get it out of your mind...

Thank you, RUSCICO, thank you.",1096329600,5,995,4.783625730994152

I have not seen it in about twenty years, but the final scene where she is on the driverless electric train going through the mist and saying to the soldiers who are chasing her that they will be cursed by the people for what they are doing is an image I have never forgotten. She is an amazing actress and the director is also great, I should also add that all of the performances in this film are outstanding.",1084320000,3,455,4.181818181818182
