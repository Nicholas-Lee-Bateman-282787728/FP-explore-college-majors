Hope someone sometime gets the film copy and transfers THAT to digital video.",1368316800,,247,4.391304347826087
1031397,5,6305381194,"I saw this movie in a theater in Springfield, Mass. in 1965.  I took a chance and ordered a used copy. Could've fooled me, except that the seal was broken on the case.  No complaints, great film (sort of an anthropological study of the Cafe Racer subculture).",1302480000,,259,4.48936170212766
1031398,3,6305381194,"An engaging hybrid of British 'kitchen sink' drama and American biker film, this atmospheric feature was considered daring in 1964 as it touched upon homosexuality, however obliquely.  It has a suitably somber appearance in B&W but, filmed in CinemaScope, there is a certain elegance to its images.

Dot (Rita Tushingham) and Reg (handsome newcomer Colin Campbell), a young working-class couple,  get married. She is sixteen, shallow, selfish, and vain. He is sweet, generally light-hearted, and thoughtful, but under pressure reverts to macho, blue-collar stereotype.  As a result, they fight constantly and soon separate. Reg meets Pete, a flamboyant and extroverted biker, who becomes his best mate. They move in together while Reg sorts out his life.  Despite Pete's constant mothering, possessiveness, and jealousy, naive Reg only figures out that his friend is in love with him when Pete is outed in a dockside  bar at the end of the film.  Typically, there could be no happy endings for gay men in 1964.

The film is especially interesting due to the photography, period locations, and the early cinematic homosexual reference. Colin Campbell is beautiful, a wonderful actor, and quite suited to the role of a confused youth trying hard, but not prepared, to be an adult.  His pretty, boyish presence is essential to the theme of sexual repression which precipitates all the minor tragedies and frustrations in his life.

This Televista version is a poor Pan&Scan version.  There are two widescreen issues, from Kino (out of print) and Blackhorse (Region 2), well worth searching for.  It makes a great difference to see the film in its original form without half the screen missing.  The wide format is especially convincing in the road and racing sequences.",1179532800,24,1766,5.176056338028169
1031399,5,6305381194,"This British New Wave film is in the social comment style of A Taste of Honey and A Kind of Loving and it is one of the best of these films.  The relationship between the two mates in the story has been misunderstood since gay liberation and so therefore has the film.  The film is about the disillusionment of youth in the modern world.  The story has two young buddies enjoying the freedom of the roads on their motorbikes while facing having to grow up in the adult world.  One of them gets married and finds himself entangled in the responsibilities of marriage, while the other (Dudley Sutton's character) is determined to avoid this fate and keep his motorbike and the freedom of the roads, so he has nothing to do with girls.  However at the end of the film, when the two friends finally part to go their separate ways, Dudley Sutton's young man is left facing a future of rootless drifting with the spectre of homosexuality lurking ahead of him.  The homosexual figure at the end of the film is delberately intimidating and the film's ending would not have the power that it does if he was already a homosexual.  The film is about the fall of innocence and youth.  Seen this way (as it was in the 60s) the film is very powerful.",1115769600,3,1236,4.438053097345133
1031400,4,6305381194,"""Leather Boys"" is a black-and-white noirish film of the kitchen sink school directed by Canadian Sidney J. Furie and starring '60s pop icon Rita Tushingham.  However, it is Colin Campbell, as Tushingham's young  husband, who takes center stage in the drama, and his performance is  heart-breaking.  ""Leather Boys"" is essentially a drama about  consequences.  Campbell's character marries Tushingham because that's what  a young man from his class and with his prospects does.  But he is unhappy  in marriage and with the lack of options available to a young man in the  era before London began to swing in the 1960s, without really knowing why.  Then a new mate comes into his life, played by the great character actor  Dudley Sutton, and his world is suddenly turned upside down.  Can a couple  of motorcycle jocks find love in England in 1963?  You probably already  know the answer to that one, but see for yourself how it plays out on film.  The closing scene is a study in ambivalence.  To my mind, this is a  little-known classic of early ""gay"" cinema.",954547200,12,1058,4.810055865921788

7889554,5,6305381194,"I find the Leather Boys one of the more engaging of the British kitchen sink films, with its young and somewhat hopeful characters and the portrayal of the motorcyclists and their Wandsworth hangout and scene. It begins like many of the British films of this period, with a look at a young working class couple but eventually has some surprising twists. The couple are Reggie (Colin Campbell) and Dot (Rita Tushingham) and they are young enough to be living at home and spend much of their free time at the Ace Cafe on North Circular Road, the meeting place for London's biker crowd. These were mostly young people, portrayed as good-natured and fun, if a bit rowdy.( Do not bring American Hells Angels-type biker gangs into your mind.)

Reggie is a very sympathetic lad; he isn't particularly angry, he just isn't quite sure what he wants to do with his life. Dot is an airhead, to put it bluntly, shallow and vain but at least fun loving and well-intentioned. Dot wants to get married, for no particular reason except that that's what girls do and Reggie goes along with it, well, because he's an agreeable guy. Recipe for a perfect marriage, right? Even the honeymoon leads to disagreements and as they drift apart back in London, Dot proves to be a poor homemaker who mostly likes to go shopping with her mum and get her hair done. Reggie starts hanging out with his mates and takes up with the seemingly carefree Pete, with whom he becomes best friends to the exclusion of Dot. Events proceed from there.

This is a fascinating film in every way from its good acting to the fine black and white photography. The scenes of everyday British like in the early 60's is especially priceless from the biker hangout to the family wedding and especially the honeymoon at Butlins big seaside resort (where Ringo Starr once worked) with its crowds and dance hall. As in many of these films, the scenes of daily life seem almost like documentary footage.  The motorcycle race from the Ace Cafe to Edinburgh is an unexpected treat in the film, opening it up far more than the usual kitchen sink drama. Though references to homosexuality are in the plot, ""The Leather Boys"" refers simply to the leather jackets worn by the motorcyclists and not to a gay S&M kind of thing which it might suggest today. While not quite as intense and dramatic as some of the other British New Wave Films, it scores on its honest portrayal of its everyday characters whose lives seem to mirror the lives of many people.",1457222400,,2492,4.64625850340136
7889555,4,6305381194,"Pretty good story to which a working class Brit can relate. Immature couple get married and the shine fades rapidly. Yes, even during their honeymoon. Locale is the inevitable gray and rainy row house environment. If you're American you will need captioning because the accents are a bit on the thick side. Note the repeated use of ""init"", a contraction of ""isn't it"", by the cast. A true depiction of the working class in the UK.",1449100800,,430,4.671052631578948
