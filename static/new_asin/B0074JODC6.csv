5054645,4,B0074JODC6,"Though it sort of bounces back & forth, it is a great overview & history of Led Zeppelin. I especially like the interviews & footage of Peter Grant (their manager) who was highly instrumental in their success. I'd recommend this to anybody even remotely interested in what Led Zeppelin was all about.",1358208000,5,300,4.788461538461538
5054646,5,B0074JODC6,"Led Zeppelin, ... great, as always !!!
Led Zeppelin, what was, is now, and always will be.
I love watching Jason Bonham in his Dad's shoes.",1357171200,,139,4.384615384615385
5054647,5,B0074JODC6,"It has interviews with Peter Grant. right  before he died. Also Ahmet Ertegan................
(I think that's how you spell it) Anyway it takes you all way up the O2 show in 2007",1356998400,10,178,4.5625
5054648,5,B0074JODC6,"This is the epitomy of rock n roll. When you go to Webster's Dictionary and look up rock n roll, it should say ""See Led Zeppelin"".",1355875200,4,130,4.038461538461538
5054649,5,B0074JODC6,i love it just the greatest band in the world just wish i was there  hope they tour again around here  love it,1355356800,2,110,3.739130434782609
5054650,5,B0074JODC6,"An interesting, informative and well done documentary.  I caught part of this on the Bio or History channel and didn't have a chance to watch it all but I knew it would be worth buying  It was!  A must have for the Zeppelin fan.",1354147200,14,228,4.136363636363637
5054651,2,B0074JODC6,"This is not much in the way of fun and insightful to watch. Once they get to Zeppelin 4, the rest of the program lasts about 10 minutes and mostly covers Bonzo's death and its aftermath. For Zeppelin freaks, it is, I suppose, a little lemon juice on your leg.",1352851200,34,259,4.2
5054654,4,B0074JODC6,Excellent Show,1512950400,,14,6.5
5054655,3,B0074JODC6,"Very good for a topical overview.  Lacks something however.  This band can be profiled better I take to task.  I think it is definitely for dyed-in-the-wool fans who likely, actually, know everything here and more.  I'm still waiting of r something more definitive.",1512777600,,265,5.093023255813954
5054656,1,B0074JODC6,"How could anyone give this 5,4,3, or even 2 stars?  It sucks.  I don't think there's actually any zeppelin songs in the movie.  Maybe just clips that are short enough to avoid having to pay for the use of them?",1512691200,3,210,4.2
5054657,3,B0074JODC6,Nothing new here. It has all been said and done. Long live their music.,1512259200,,71,4.142857142857143
5054658,3,B0074JODC6,"I was really puzzled to see only a 3 1/2 star rating. Fans of a band like Zeppelin tend to be ecstatic about any product they can get. Now I get it.

If you're a fan, you'll enjoy the vintage stills and footage, maybe the interviews. You'll also be frustrated as hell as you slowly realize they didn't license one note of Robert Plant's singing!

If you're new to Zeppelin, you'll probably wonder why all the fuss about a band that apparently only played blues/rock instrumentals really loud for 20 seconds at a time.",1507420800,2,517,4.48936170212766
5054659,2,B0074JODC6,A real stinker.,1506729600,,15,4.333333333333333
5054660,2,B0074JODC6,no Led Zeppelin music in the entire documentary. Only cover songs of Zeppelin. Also looks like it was patched together from random interview. This band deserves a high quality documentary. Not this.,1505779200,3,198,5.21875
5054661,1,B0074JODC6,"Another fake ""critical review"" rockumentary. No original interviews with Led Zep, just a bunch of no names like ""entertainment lawyers."" A few short clips of older Zep, just short enough to avoid copyright infringement. And much of the ""Zep"" music is actually cover bands making making Zeppish instrumental music. Sucks....",1505606400,10,323,5.48
5054662,1,B0074JODC6,"I'm 30 minutes in and I haven't heard Robert Plant sing once- NOT ONCE!  Even while the unimportant old dudes were talking about what an amazing singer he was!  Even when playing fan footage!  The minute he started to sing, they muted him in order to keep blabbing about his singing!  A crime",1505433600,4,292,4.452830188679245
5054663,2,B0074JODC6,"Someday, someone who loves Led Zep will make a thoughtful, respectful, non-sensationalized history that explores their music, their creativity, their artistry, and their rise and fall. Unfortunately, this ain't it. Stock footage, short musical excerpts that are repeated endlessly, a handful of talking heads (with lots of shots showing their hands, I guess that's ""artistic"") and almost nothing about the band's songwriting or album production. At least, that's what the first 45 minutes looked like, admittedly that's all I could take.",1505088000,2,537,5.6419753086419755
5054674,3,B0074JODC6,"Hyperbolic film that glosses over Led Zeppelin's ripping off of many originators of ""their"" songs, while extolling the virtues of their manager and endlessly looping through the limited footage of live performance.",1504310400,,214,5.71875
5054675,2,B0074JODC6,"Audio quality is bad. Some of the backing tracks sound like cheap karaoke versions of original songs. The story of the band is here, but impossible to feel it due to poor audio quality.",1503705600,2,185,4.470588235294118
5054676,3,B0074JODC6,For those in the know there won't really be anything new here. I understand licensing Zep music can be pricey but I could have done without the attempts at Zeplike music in the background over and over.,1503187200,3,202,4.486486486486487
5054677,5,B0074JODC6,"Nothing haunts you like the music of your youth. I saw these guys at Royal Albert Hall in London while I was bumming around Europe on $2/day in 1969 with a high school friend.
So here I am at 65 years old, still wanting more Led Zeppelin. With that kind of experience, I found this DVD to be very interesting and enjoyable.",1500595200,2,323,4.225806451612903

5054679,2,B0074JODC6,No John Bonham on the cover.,1490140800,,28,3.8333333333333335
5054680,1,B0074JODC6,"This is a very disappointing DVD.  It uses the same stock footage throughout with very quick glimpses of concert footage that doesn't provide the matching music.  Instead a very mundane 60s riff that is unrecognizable to me is repeated throughout.  No doubt the people who made this DVD didn't want to pay the fees required to use the real Zeppelin tunes.  It is inconsistent throughout - it undertakes detailed discussions about the first four albums and then fails to even mention one of its finest - Houses of the Holy.  If you want to really learn about the history of this true super group, perhaps the greatest of many great classic rock bands, you'd be far better served to read ""When Giants Walked the Earth"" by Mick Wall.  Save your money, I wish I could get mine back.",1485734400,5,778,4.601449275362318
5054681,3,B0074JODC6,"This is an interesting documentary, and I'd recommend it for any Zeppelin fan.*  It includes recent (post-Zeppelin) interview snippets with Plant and Jones, in which they nostalgically reminisce about the recording sessions, the tours, the fabled destruction of hotels, their relationship with manager Peter Grant, etc.  Most of the dialogue is from a couple guys who were close to the band in the early days.  Perhaps my favorite brief segment is when Jimmy Page, along with fellow British guitarists Eric Clapton and Jeff Beck (!) have a face-to-face meeting with Queen Elizabeth.  She's obviously not a follower - they explain to her that they play guitar.  (Jeff Beck laments that he was never as famous as the other two.)

* BE ADVISED!  The DVD cover says, ""featuring rare performance footage.""  In my opinion, that is deceptive.  It has some brief video snips of the band in performance, including fan-recorded video (obviously using a device far inferior to the ""phone cameras"" of late), and there is some background instrumental music - mostly ""Dazed and Confused.""  But there is little if any performance footage where you see the video and hear the music... it's almost all voice-overs.  If you want to see performance footage, get yourself the 2-DVD concert set -&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Led-Zeppelin/dp/B00008PX8P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Led Zeppelin</a>&nbsp;- it's excellent.

(I borrowed this DVD from the local public library.  The hour I spent watching it was well-spent, but I'm glad I didn't buy it.)",1483747200,,1574,5.535564853556485
5054682,5,B0074JODC6,"After reading some of the reviews concerning this movie, I must admit that I was a bit apprehensive.  I ordered it anyway.  ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC !!  I saw Led Zep in concert in 1972, 1975 and 1977 at the San Diego Sports Arena....and I was the first in line to get in each time (when spending the night at an arena the night before was thought to be insane - and it was ""open seating"" back then - with no rip-off ticket agency scalpers !! I actually took color photos of them when in the front row two of the three times I saw them !)....at any rate, a good friend of mine at University High School in San Diego, Cameron Crowe, recently left school to be their ""road writer"" for Rolling Stone magazine, after R.S. editor, Jann Wenner, read Cameron's work in ""Cream"" magazine.  He and I loved Led Zeppelin in high school.  They were the most FANTASTIC band in the world to see in concert...and after watching this DVD, it brought back some of those incredible memories I felt as a 24-year old (now in my 60's)....and while I was watching them on my TV with this DVD, I felt, ONCE AGAIN, the power and the AWE from the mighty Zep once again....fantastic interviews of the band, and great chronicle of the band, how they formed, the myths and legends, and the incredible history of the most dynamic rock and roll band ever seen, heard or to perform on planet Earth's history !",1476230400,33,1373,4.389763779527559

5054691,3,B0074JODC6,It wasn't exactly what I expected to get. But it's OK. This band was heavily explored in and out for so many years and some people manage to squeeze it to the very last drop even today;))),1421884800,,188,4.108108108108108

8510040,1,B0074JODC6,"As other reviews have noted, you will not hear Robert Plant sing a note in this docu-travesty. And the playing in the background is not  Zeppelin on an off night, rather a cover band that not only isn't the real deal, but isn't even Great White. And in a very sneaky way, this generic heavy rock is tacked onto grainy footage of the actual band live on the stage . If you've ever listened to Led Zeppelin's music, this is a directorial sleight-of-hand that goes over like a lead balloon. There are extended interviews with very peripheral figures from the band's history, and little bits of stock interview footage from the band members themselves and their legendary manager Peter Grant. But these are tiny bits of truffle, added to pureed garbage that isn't worth a buck. Did I mention that I didn't like the video?",1517184000,,817,4.63448275862069
