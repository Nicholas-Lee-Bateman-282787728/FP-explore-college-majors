7906275,5,B00000F0Z9,"I love these old shows growing up ,this DVD is exactly like if I was watching on
them on TV for the first time, the quality is superb, this DVD brings me so much joy. I ordered more. The best shows from Costello with his pots and pans to getting in the playing music at hillary's birthday party, even the duck dinner. I am looking for the one with the mustard  factory bit with brunch with Mike the cop and bingo. I will keep looking for that one. This is a great delight and I'm very satisfied.",1493510400,,495,4.103092783505154
7906276,5,B00000F0Z9,I'm a big fan of abbot and costello since I was a kid and seening these shows again and again is great fun for me.right now I'm going to buy vol. 8 to 12,1226361600,,153,3.5294117647058822
7906277,4,B00000F0Z9,"I have an old LP record (remember those?) of Abbot & Costello's ""Who's on First?"" routine, plus other A & C routines that I really don't remember very well.  ""Who's on First"" is a great classic, and is the reason I purchased this DVD (the audio-only version does not appear to be available anymore).  Although the W-o-F routine on this DVD isn't exactly the one from my old record, it is certainly close enough, and still very funny.  It is nice to be able to actually SEE the routine, so I'm glad I got the DVD.  The rest of the DVD contains shows that definitely have their moments.  ""Duck Dinner"" and ""Million Dollar Refund"" are very good, in particular.  It is refreshing to see actual TALENT in comedy!  It was difficult to decide between 4 and 5 stars for this one, so it is probably best to consider my rating as 4 and a half stars.",1173312000,,839,4.339743589743589
7906278,3,B00000F0Z9,"This is a great DVD, but there should be more shows then the the four. That's probalbly the only reason I wouldn't purchase any more of these DVD's. Either include more episodes or lower the price!!",1153785600,3,198,4.527777777777778
7906279,5,B00000F0Z9,"Great comedy.  Quality very good.  It's too bad that comedy today does not follow the format.  Those were the days when people actually had to have talent! If you're a A&C fan, this is a must to have.",1130025600,3,200,4.2105263157894735
7906280,5,B00000F0Z9,"From the minute Abbott and Costello hit the screen to the end credits on this four show set (and each additional set) we are able to witness the end of a great american art form called Burlesque. And Abbott and Costello were easily the greatest surviving exponents of that style comedy. Besides being the absolute best comedy team ever the ""boys"" are smart enough to give us maybe the best supporting cast ever assembled in a comedy series. First there is the brilliant Sid Fields. Not only does he do multiple duty playing a vast assortment of (always) funny characters but he even wrote the series to boot! And if that weren't enough we have Joe Besser the ex stooge (or was he a stooge after this) playing arguably the funniest fifty year old kid ever! Then there's Hilary Brook who combines timing and beauty as well as maybe being the greatest ""straight"" woman ever! Filling out the cast is Joe Kirk who also plays several characters and Mike the cop. Both are excellent foils for Lou. After those players you will see many of your favorite character actors and actresses from the fifties such as Gloria De Heaven, Jane Frazee, Phyllis Coates, and many others. Sadly the show ran for only two years and was cancelled. It's a tribute to Lou's brilliance as a business man that he insisted that the boys have ownership of the series after they ran once. In fact Lou forced Bud Abbott to do the series as well. Seems Lou the ""dumb"" one was actually the mastermind behind the team and made very smart creative decisions. A special Emmy should be given to the boys and to Sid Fields for having written the second greatest conmedy series of all time (the Honeymooners being the first). Buy any volume without hesitation today before they take them off the market and you kick yourself for not getting them when you could have!",1121385600,7,1825,4.601226993865031
7906281,4,B00000F0Z9,"A&C's classic ""Who's On First"" routine and Sid Fields' brilliance earn most of the four stars I've given volume 1. However, it's a shame the greedy distributers have shafted A&C fans by:  1)Including only four episodes per disc when DVD's bandwidth provides room for at least seven. Thus the entire series could have fit on eight DVDs with considerable room left for extras.  2)Every A&C fan I've ever met considers the 1952 first season vastly superior to the disappointing 1953 second season. As is done routinely with TV series, the two seasons should have been issued separately on four discs each. That would, of course, have greatly diminished the producers' profits as second season sales would have been relatively meager. A&C fans be damned!  3)The outrageously high price compared to other popular TV series. The 13 volumes cost nearly $200 even after allowing for discounts offered by online sellers or retailers. Two seasons of ""The Dick Van Dyke Show"" sells for about half that. Also, sellers like deepdiscountdvd.com offer much lower discounts on A&C discs than is their norm, which leads me to  believe that the producers have set an unusually high wholesale price, which would preclude sellers from offering the usual discounts.  Ironically, the producers' greed has probably cut their profits while concommitently denying many young people a chance to view A&C's brilliance. When browsing for DVDs I often see potential customers pick up A&C discs, visibly recoil when they see the prices, and quickly replace them in their bins. Had the series producers offered the 1st and 2nd seasons  separately, on fewer discs, and at more reasonable prices, I believe the set would have sold untold thousands more copies.  Bud Abbott, Lou Costello, Sid Fields, Joe Kirk, Hillary Brooke, Gordon Jones, Joe Besser, et al, all gone, deserved better.",1093910400,37,1852,5.132890365448505
7906282,4,B00000F0Z9,"The 52 Abbott & Costello TV episodes are a rarity. Must be: with only 4 of them to a DVD that'd easily hold six or seven. These are lovingly-transfered from the original 35mm masters owned by Lou's daughter-- Chris Costello, authoress of the excellent book ""LOU'S ON FIRST!"". In the ""olden days"" [before VHS], Bud and Lou insisted upon owning the ""home-theatrical rights"" of their 36 movies, and 52 TV shows on ACTUAL film. MOST television programs from the 1950s no longer even exist beause filming broadcasts was quite expensive...I LOVE LUCY comes to mind as another survivor (who knew the reruns would build Desi & Lucy-- DesiLu-- their own  studios with the first TV program to use multiple cameras? In the early 1940s, when the Abbott & Costello COULD've owned Univeral Studios, outright-- and DID save them from bankruptsy-- one of the biggies in their contracts was ""home movie rights"". Bud and Lou were competative, and enjoyed watching 16mm films, at liesure, IN their own home-screening rooms at a time when watching movies at home wasn't possible to the average ""Joe"" who probably didn't even own a television yet...or a horse, a pool, restaurants, a nice car. The comedy team, even in their advancing years, really WERE ""the boys!"" Everyone knows that ""Boys like toys."" Good enough reason that ALL of these programs-- like Bud and Lou-- STILL survive. In many cases, these, almost plot-less <read SIENFIELD here> excuses for repeating ""old chestnuts"" are the ONLY surviving representations of famous vaudeville skits honed and sharpened by A & C-- also my favorite VITAMINS. (My review COULD have rated a ""5"" if there were five episodes on this DVD-- a ""6"" if there were six.) => YOU do the math. <= 13 DVDs or 13 VHS tapes!? The only way I'd replace my VHS tapes is if there were LESS ""little-video-boxes"" to fall off my fairly-full video shelves. The covers on the DVD and VHS tape of ""#1 of 13"" are identical, and I doubt the DVD-transfer is more pristine than the EXCELLENT tapes in the series.  ATTENTION: I do NOT own the DVD-- this review is based on the VHS copy of the same program material.  Buy it. WHICH version is up to your wallet-- and shelf!",978825600,29,2170,4.735449735449736
