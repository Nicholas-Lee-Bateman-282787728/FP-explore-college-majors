6708351,5,B00O3GUZ5C,Amazing brilliant acting -  made me nostalgic to a time probably my grandmother wasn't even born. heart warming story and one that can be watched with children without fear of vile language or bad scenes. I haven't seen the Shirley temple version but can't imagine it one upping baby peggy and I am a fan of Shirley temple - there's no remaking a classic and I really wish they'd quit doing that no matter the genre or era.,1354492800,3,423,4.423076923076923
6708352,5,B00O3GUZ5C,"This is a charming movie and in such amazing quality for a motion picture filmed in 1924. It shows how rustic Laguna Beach was back then in contrast to it being presently another over-developed Orange County,CA community. Baby Peggy is a real little heart-stealer. This film is probably her best effort and shows why she was so wildly popular at the time. A timeless classic of a film just like the children's book which inspired it.",1329436800,7,433,4.7105263157894735

8681840,4,B00O3GUZ5C,"Baby Peggy was a very popular and well-paid child actor from the silent era, but time has not been kind to her memory or her films. Many of them are lost today. Luckily Captain January survives and it is an excellent example of Peggy's talent. She is a very natural and adorable actress, the perfect child for a role that tugs at your heartstrings.

Captain January is an orphan. Her parents' boat wrecked near a lighthouse, and the lighthouse operator rescued the baby from the debris. He believes that the little girl was sent to him by God to keep him company in his old age. Her vibrancy keeps him young too. At five years old, she needs to begin her education, and while ""Daddy Judkins"" teaches her what he believes to be important-- The Bible, Shakespeare, and the dictionary-- the meddling women in town don't believe he is a suitable parent. In the midst of his fight to keep her, her biological aunt arrives and discovers that the adorable little girl is indeed her niece.

There is a definite feel of the 20s emanating from this film. The focus on nature, the strong belief in God, the sentimentality which is accessible to all ages and not at all pushy-- all of these elements combine to create an old fashioned but by no means irrelevant story.",1356912000,2,1256,4.553097345132743
