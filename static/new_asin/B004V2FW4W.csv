8442684,4,B004V2FW4W,"I have watched so many really good movies over the last 2 years that commenting on this one is a little intriguing.but more than that i was so taken aback that i had to do something to vent my amusement and elation so i rushed to the site and now i m writing a review. More than a review it is just an experience oozing out to the web page. Although i have grown up watching all kind of Hindi cinema i am not such a big fan of it(now that i have watched cinema from all round the world)as far as story driven movies are concerned. More than stories generally our movies are all about stars and now a days a few typecast characters. Instances of movies purely driven by a strong story are not umpteen to say the least. Well after watching ankahee today i can safely add it to the list of great story backed cinema. such a lovely script,with a quite an out of the league music,which is so unconventional but complements the film superbly are what make this movie a radical experience. Watch it to believe it and expect no fireworks because there are not any. The movie just flows without much ado but but leaves you spellbound. And i had never heard of the name is such a pity and there are only 10 votes for the film vindicates the fact that this jewel is still lying somewhere undiscovered by movie-buffs. So go-out today and bag a copy.",1304985600,2,1337,4.267716535433071
