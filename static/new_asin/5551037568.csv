204974,3,5551037568,the documentary is a remastering of a old movie in the times of the war... but not have subtitles in spanish,1353801600,,108,4.190476190476191

204976,5,5551037568,"A great story that explains world politics and what we are still struggling with even today. Most notably the manipulation of populations for global advantage and the value of various regions of the earth. And yes, it is US propaganda and still an accurate snapshot of America and other countries before and during WWII. Highly recommended for repeated viewings.",1310428800,5,362,5.1525423728813555
204977,1,5551037568,"I should have known better that if you're going to squeeze 7 movies, nearly 8 hours of video onto two DVDs, that the quality would suck.  The compression on the video is so bad that images are blurry at times.  Plus there are audio and video dropouts.  I returned this and bought the set from PDQ Filmworks where each movie is on its own DVD, and there are two extra WWII movies, to boot.  If you want a cursory view of these great films from Capra, then buy this edition.  But if you want a true collector's quality set, in great packaging that will last you years, then I'd check out the 8-disc set from PDQ.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/WHY-WE-FIGHT-7-World-War-II-Films-by-Frank-Capra-8-Disc-DVD-set-Complete-Series/dp/B000UVDKO2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">WHY WE FIGHT: 7 World War II Films by Frank Capra (8-Disc DVD set, Complete Series)</a>",1296518400,19,894,5.641791044776119
204978,3,5551037568,"The Why We Fight series is a masterpiece, composed of many clips taken from the second world war. I plan to show this series to my class, and I know they will be entertained and educated. The price is great, but there is one problem there should be seven programs.  Series titles should include: * Prelude to War * The Nazis Strike * Divide & Conquer * Battle of Britain * Battle of Russia Part 1 & 2 * Battle of China * War Comes to America. To get four for 9.99 is a steal!",1293321600,6,475,4.0
204979,1,5551037568,"We bought this with great expectations, but the videos were defective.  SKU will not respond to our complaint, so we will review this wonderful series this way---if you can find a modern set that works, buy it.  This is a worthwhile look at early WWII America, and its homey values.  It identifies the enemy specifically,and beats the propaganda drum beautifully, if that can be done.  Our collector's edition was a bust, but find a merchant other than SKU, and be rewarded with a superb documentary, couched within its own time.

SKU...don't mess with loyal Amazon customers.  We remember.

7802332,5,5551037568,"This is a ""Must Have"" for all history buffs, especially those of history of World War II. The CD's are well produced, with only small amount of blemishes attributable to the decomposition of original film over the years; but even then not too bad. I also think this would be a great tool for teaching young people a lot about that era, particularly the national attitude and mind-set of the 1940's, when victory was anything but certain!!!

These CD's are the entire set of films made and shown to every member of the U S Armed Forces during World War II as a tool of educating them and informing them as to the reasons behind the war and indeed, ""Why We Fight"" in it. The films were produced and distributed throughout the war and immediately after by many movie professionals of Hollywood who were on active duty ""for the duration."" It also includes footage following the fall of Nazi Germany depicting the concentration camps and hideous aftermath from them. The number of eyewitnesses from that era are disappearing at an alarming pace, so this set contains an immortal witness of that period that so shook the world.

I think this set is well worth the money and is also very well produced. I recommend it without reservation!",1432771200,,1231,4.668202764976958

7802334,3,5551037568,Quality of video is OK but not restored from original so it is a little fuzzy. Be forewarned it is packaged and distributed by what I would term conservative christian interests who are promoting the christian world view as opposed to a more universalist approach. It comes with study questions that reflect their agenda.,1412208000,,321,4.962962962962963
7802335,5,5551037568,"This series of ""patriotic documentaries"".... okay, propaganda films...were made by Hollywood filmmaker Frank Capra during the Second World War to justify our involvement in the war.  The Axis being the fascists that they were, Capra's job was relatively simple.  Still, Capra's series is dramatic and thrilling and gives a good overview as to what was going on back then.  I heartily recommend this series to everyone.",1402531200,3,418,5.303030303030303
