I have seen Miss Scotto live during her heyday in San Francisco and at the Met, and the vocal hardness and juddering high notes are absent on this DVD.  Instead, in this Montreal concert, we get a plethora of lovely pianissimi - even when not appropriate.  No matter.  There are a couple of fortissimo notes that are slightly unpleasant, but the rest are held back and what we get are lovely sounds throughout.  She sings Verdi, Puccini, Catalani to great effect and with great feeling.  All of her great roles are represented here.  Any Scotto fan and opera lover would be happy with this DVD - she looks and sounds lovely.  The recital from Japan is not as grand.  She sings persuasively throughout, mostly Italian and French lieder, with some operatic chestnuts thrown in for good measure. The mostly Japanese audience is very appreciative.  I am going to add this one to my collection, too.",1124409600,5,1017,4.7542857142857144
