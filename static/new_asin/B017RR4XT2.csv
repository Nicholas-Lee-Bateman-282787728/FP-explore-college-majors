7514990,5,B017RR4XT2,My copy of Shaun Two was disappointing. Volume two had no sound but volume one was perfect. Another copy of the set was the same- no sound on Two. It's disappointing because I adore Shaun and his screwy flock. The sounds do make a difference in spite of the fact that there's no real speech. If you can obtain a working set I highly recommend Shaun. It sounds like a kid's program but adults will laugh too.,1458000000,,407,4.298701298701299
7514991,5,B017RR4XT2,Even better than Season 1...loads of laughs!!!  I am 41 and laugh along with my 7-year old to these.  Sheep rule!,1456272000,,113,4.333333333333333
7514992,5,B017RR4XT2,"Let them eat Sheep Dip AGAIN - to all the sellers trying to get a hundred dollars for this out of print stuff.
Lionsgate is re-issuing this baby.
The first ""let them eat sheep dip"" I posted was under the Season One re-release listing (along with the US release of the new movie Nov 2015).
Time to head back to the barn once again for those 7 minute chuckles.
You (and the kids) won't regret buying this or Season One, even if it's just for a quick thing to watch before bedtime.
And after the kids go to bed, pop up some popcorn and sit back, watch some more, and chuckle (some more)...
These little 7 minutes tunes are that addicting.

Update: December 10, 2015.
Lionsgate has updated the release info on this baby, and even more reason to ""let them eat sheep dip!""
Tell those marketplace sellers to keep your old releases of the these programs!
Just like the wonderful discovery of the newly season one re-issue, season two will also be 16x9 widescreen for the first time in the U.S.
And has anyone noticed the season one episodes begin with just a little gap of black before the episode begins?
The older issues used to start already in progress with the theme music as they were poorly mastered the first time.
I'm so happy, happy, happy that I'll volunteer to spoon feed sheep dip to those marketplace sellers for being so greedy to make money off of the out of print stuff that kept us from buying!
Christmas comes again in February 2016.
Thank you!",1447286400,8,1455,4.449438202247191
7515062,5,B017RR4XT2,"What's not to love about Shaun? Note to parents. This season has less ""scary"" episodes which is nice for younger kids. A few of the episodes are off the wall, but that's kind of a nice break.

Having the episodes be pure situational fun and not forcing some point of view is also refreshing.",1470960000,,291,4.388888888888889
