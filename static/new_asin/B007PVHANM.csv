5103696,5,B007PVHANM,Much Love and Blessing to the Marley family for authorizing this very detailed account of his Majesty's son and messenger - Robert Nesta Marley!  The interviews from close family members and friends really set this documentary apart from other works about the great Bob Marley.  This documentary will help educate generations upon generations to come that Bob Marley was on a mission to spread Jah's Love for all mankind.  One Love to Kevin MacDonald and his team for creating a great piece of art. - JAH Bless,1335052800,56,510,4.839080459770115
5103697,5,B007PVHANM,"Can't say enough good about the Bob Marley documentary. Extremely well done, supremely interesting, wonderfully informing and moving. 5 stars out of 5, if you like Marley at all, you owe it to yourself to see it. What more could this man have done for the world if he had lived longer? It would certainly be a better place, of that I and I have no doubt whatsoever! Could you be loved? Then be loved!",1334966400,83,400,4.346666666666667

5103704,5,B007PVHANM,"What I liked most about this film is it really digged deep behind the inspiring music and legend of Bob Marley revealing what made him tick, and the true meaning of his impacting music. It will change how you view him as an artist and change the way you listen to his art. I have only more respect for the man rather than the legend. Thank you Bob...",1483228800,,350,4.161764705882353

5103770,5,B007PVHANM,"About 10 minutes into it, I realized I'd already seen this film, and yet I watched it again with the same interest and enjoyment as the first time.  I've seen a bunch of different movies about Jamaica, Reggae, and Marley himself.  This tells his story in a really...approachable way.  It's a good mix of archival video and photos, concert footage, and interviews with his family and contemporaries.  There are a few interesting facts and stories interspersed within the film, but it's not an exhaustive history of the era.  The characters are familiar and quirky as ever, the anecdotes are vague and dubious as ever, and the arch of the story is a little bumpy at times.  But all in all, it's a great film that fans must see.",1433980800,,725,4.625

5103838,5,B007PVHANM,"Being a born & bred Jamaican, I found the documentary/movie ""Marley"" very informative. I left the island in 1978, but I had never really appreciated Bob Marley & his music while growing up. This movie gives so much information about Bob the man, his beliefs, his fears, his philosophy about life. He was a very insightful musician, so immensely talented, so full of the desire for peace among his brothers & sisters, as shown in his writing ""One Love."" The latter part of the movie tells of his battle with cancer & how he faced it, how he fought it, how he finally made peace. Taken too young, way too soon. I don't know anyone who doesn't love Bob Marley & his music - the world loved this man. Anyone who has ever thought they could relate to his music should see this movie, & you will really appreciate how he influenced his fans. Loved every minute of it.",1412208000,4,861,4.421383647798742

5103846,3,B007PVHANM,"Bob Marley and Barack Obama have one salient historical similarity; they came into this world a product of bi-racial parents, of african and caucasian descendancy.  While in Obama's case, his mother was white, in Bob's case his mother was african Jamaican, but both men would lead extraordinary lives, with Marley's being unfortunately much too brief.  His is a tale of nascent talent awakening in the form of a new style of music influenced by salsa and other latin music sounds, but the reggae style that evolved is characteristically distinctive in its cadence, rhythm, and beat.  This video provides a really good understanding of Bob Marley's life as seen through the eyes of friends, associates, lovers, his wife, and many others who became close to him on his journey through life.  A committed Rastafarian, who incomprehensibly smoked ganja weed in heavy doses while simultaneously treating his body as a temple not to be poisoned by impurities in food, drink, or thoughts......Marley created quite a stir among the music afficionados of the world.  The story as presented by this rather lengthly bio is thoughtfully done, with high regard for Marley and his political achievements through musical messaging that challenged people to learn to work together, to live together in a peaceable manner, but to fight for your fundamental individual right to freedom in thought, word and deed.  I came away from this with a newfound respect for Marley, although I am in complete denial of the authenticity of the rastafarian ""religion"" to exist as a belief system at all, and I certainly cannot fathom the value in letting ones hair grow forever as a sign of the intensity of ones faith.  But that's where the freedom of individual thinking is manifest, correct?",1411430400,,1763,5.058620689655172

But as a casual fan, someone who's knowledge about Bob and his career comes exclusively from the liner notes of the Songs of Freedom box set, I learned a lot about the man and his music from this documentary. The production values are excellent, with subtitles for shlubs like me who can only understand every third word coming out of Scratch Perry's mouth. There is plenty of great live footage and commentary on the music and specific gigs by the musicians. They sprung for the rights to use Marley's music, so the soundtrack is great. They interviewed the right people--Rita, Scratch, Family Man, Tosh, etc etc--so the stories are interesting, first-hand, and in the case of the musicians interviewed, actually about the music, how it's played, that sort of thing. My only complaint is that it's too short.",1397520000,,1000,4.8882352941176475

5103924,4,B007PVHANM,"I've always been a Marley fan so I was interested in his background.  This profile gave a pretty balanced view of his life without dipping into idol worship as in some documentaries.  Great musician, not such a great husband and father.  A good reminder that celebrities are real people.",1395273600,,287,4.816326530612245
5103925,5,B007PVHANM,Very interesting and creative in how it was filmed.  I would recommend for anyone wanting to know more about Bob Marley.  We especially loved the real interviews and clips of him performing.  He was another great talent who died too soon!,1395187200,,238,4.7560975609756095

5103932,5,B007PVHANM,I would recommend this documentary. It was a very interesting insight to the life and beliefs of a musical legend.,1393804800,,114,4.75
5103933,4,B007PVHANM,"I have listened to Marley for years, knew a little of the back story, knew that he died from cancer contracted through a melanoma on his toe.  This gives you a sense of his roots, upbringing, and remarkable transformation to a first rate musician whose music lifted him from poverty. It also shows the underbelly of sycophants and hanger-ons that attach themselves to anyone wildly successful.  Like Mozart, one can only imagine the music we might have heard had Marley lived a long and prosperous life.",1393545600,,503,4.837209302325581

5103937,4,B007PVHANM,"Impressive documentary. I loved seeing this very spiritual side of Bob Marley, and how prolific a songwriter he was!!! The only thing I would have liked, would be to see the filmmakers delve a little more into an analysis of the albums and a bit more on what happened in Marley's development into the leader and songwriter he became. What happened from the time of ""Burnin'"" and ""Catch a Fire"", to ""Natty Dread"" and ""Live!"", which no longer included Bunny and Peter? Who was Vincent Ford? How did he end up using his songs? But obviously you can't include everything in it or it would be a five hour affair! Thanks again to all involved for an inspiring and informative documentary!",1393200000,,682,4.644628099173554

5103942,5,B007PVHANM,"My family and I, love this movie. We are not weed smoking rastafarians, but we love this man. We love his energy for life. My Hawaiian people would consider him to have great spiritual power called ""mana"" in his voice. The power to heal with a song is a true gift passed down from the heavens or from whatever place you believe there is goodness. We love this man and we thank this man for his medicine that heals the heart, mind and soul. In Hawaii, we will never stop loving you.",1392768000,,481,4.239130434782608

5103947,5,B007PVHANM,"A fascinating documentary about Bob Marley's life, drawing on friends and associates to flesh out Bob the man, Bob the artist, Bob the husband and father, and Bob the spiritual man. Really worth watching. It's on Netflix, but I bought the DVD for the extended interviews. Bunny Wailer is a crack-up.",1392336000,,299,4.882352941176471

5103950,1,B007PVHANM,"I really expected a documentary on someone as colorful and unique as Bob Marley to embrace the topic and run with it in a creative yet factual way.  What I ended up watching was very, very dry and quite dull; but at least the music was good.  The rest of the documentary was not so impressive.",1391990400,,293,4.214285714285714
5103951,5,B007PVHANM,This was an insightful documentary on the life of Bob Marley-I enjoyed it very much.  I learned things about him that I never knew before!,1391990400,,138,4.52
5103952,5,B007PVHANM,I grew up in Jamaica when Bob Marley was in effect writing this story through his presence on the local landscape. It served to place Jamaica on the global cultural map and this disc represents an immortalisation of those experiences.,1391817600,,234,4.875
5103953,5,B007PVHANM,"I didn't know much about Bob Marley, except for the lyrical reggae music and happy smile and dreadlocks. But after completing this ~2.5 hour documentary, I understand why his music has had such long lasting appeal. It's the music of the masses, and resonates with a humanity that we can all relate to.

The documentary is a painstaking and precise history of Marley's life, from birth in Jamaica to an unwed mother and a white father that was never part of the family, to his emigration to the U.S. to his death from cancer at the age of 36. Many of his friends, associates and children are interviewed at length throughout the film, which is also interspersed with hundreds of still images and newsclips. Many of the interviews include English subtitles, which is a good thing, because the Jamaican patois is sometimes almost unrecognizable as English. But the real heart of the story, and the most compelling part of the film, are the many video clips from his concerts. The lyrical reggae music, sung and danced with abandon by Marley on stage, are mesmerizing, painting a picture of a true artist who was still evolving right up until his final concert.

I also learned about life in Jamaica and the Rastafarian movement - an African-based spiritual ideology that arose in the 1930s in Jamaica. It is sometimes described as a religion but is considered by many adherents to be a ""Way of Life"".

Bob Marley still retains a huge following more than 30 years after his death, and his style is still being mimicked by others, but there is only one Marley.

The lyrics of one of his most famous songs ""One Love"" are still trapped in my mind:
One Love! One Heart!
Let's get together and feel all right.",1391472000,,1700,4.656666666666666
5103954,5,B007PVHANM,"It's was enlightening, fascinating, and gave a new perspective on how we should treat ourselves and others. One Love. ",1391299200,,118,5.2105263157894735
5103955,5,B007PVHANM,"As a 13 year old, my mother, stepfather, sister and I went to Jamaica for a week.  Upon arrival we were greeted by a group of people in traditional dress and they were singing One Love.  I have been a fan of Bob and his band mates from that point forward.  In my early 20s I read books about Bob and watched the VHS movies that I had (Time Will Tell, Bob Marley and The Wailers, and Heartland Reggae) many, many, many times over.  I then bought the Songs of Freedom box set when it came out and listened to it for many months in my car.  His music always puts a smile on my face and takes my cares away.  He was a beautiful human being!  Not only do I recommend this movie and the rest of the stuff that I mentioned, but I recommend his other records and his words.  If ever you are feeling down or even if your not, Bob's music will put your mind right where it needs to be!  One Love  One People  One World",1391212800,,908,3.9613259668508287

5103960,5,B007PVHANM,I found this documentary to be very interesting and informative. I did not know Bob Marley was so young when he died. The streaming was smooth and clear. I will likely order some more movies and download more content  in the future.,1390867200,,232,4.523809523809524
5103961,5,B007PVHANM,I got this pretty quickly so I was very happy about that! I took this with me on a 8hr flight so I'm glad it took off 2hrs of my flight :)  Great documentary on the late and great Bob Marley. I'd recommend this seller for movies.,1390867200,,229,3.872340425531915

5103970,2,B007PVHANM,"As a musician and reggae fan, I find this story lacking in the area where Bob Marley is the most interesting to me, his music. If you are interested in his biography, there are several good books that cover that area. The beauty of video is that the music can be heard and seen. i found the very short snippets of music to be most frustrating. At one point, they start to discuss the origins of the reggae sound, then segue to an undated but early take of ""Stir it Up"", which was a truly revolutionary song in both the musical sense and in a social sense. But you get only about 20 seconds of Stir it Up, and with no date, there is no context of how revolutionary that song was at the time. Nobody had ever played a bass line like that, no song sounded like that before that song came out.

I await a Marley video bio that focuses on what made him so great, his music. This one does not deliver in that key area.",1388966400,2,912,4.094972067039106

This is the first ever documentary I watched about ""the man"".  I heard things from those who consider themselves fans.  I remember when he died.  But, I now know ""the man"" Mr. Bob Marley.  He was on a mission to sow love, peace, and togetherness.  Interesting that what many consider the most about him outside his music was his smoking ""herb"".  That was not WHO he was.  He was a man of peace.  A man of world love (coming out of his personal experiences).  And and man who had a profound gift to verbalize the rights and wrong of the world.

Jah (God) placed him here to sow into the world.  I am thankful there are those who understand him and who continue to carry the word. . . .",1387843200,,796,4.198675496688741

You don't have to be a Marley fan to appreciate this movie. He was described in the film as a ""beautiful spirit."" It's difficult to overstate how important he was in his native Jamaica, and the impact of his message and music on the development of a sense of national identity.",1386374400,,446,4.309523809523809

5103992,3,B007PVHANM,"Being that there have been so many documentaries about Bob Marley, MARLEY had an impossible task of having to deliver something new. Although brought worldwide attention to Jamaican culture, Reggae music and the Rastafari movement. Although Bob had a total of eleven children with seven women, the less-famous mothers and children of Bob's life seems to have been greatly underplayed in this film. MARLEY does deliver fascinating insights into Bob's compound and goes in depth about his illness & cancer treatments.",1384992000,,515,5.37037037037037

Had this one since this summer but followed the artist since he was an obscure group leader (The Wailers) in Jamaica, WI. This is a short story or the life of Bob Marley that's very entertaining and informative.",1382227200,,385,4.848484848484849

5104009,2,B007PVHANM,"The movie appeared to claim that Bob Marley cancer progressed because of advice from bad doctors, and this isn't really true. Bob Marley didn't want to amputate his toe, because of Rastafari beliefs of keeping the body whole, and he SOUGHT OUT doctors who would say they could cure him without amputation. I wouldn't consider him to have been misled by poor advice from doctors, because he went out looking for quacks, and this was what caused his death. Ignorance and wishful thinking was the same thing that killed Steve Jobs.

It was nice to see a movie about a person who was a hero to so many, but it's frustrating to see them broadcast sugar-coated b/s about why the man really died.",1378080000,2,689,4.6016260162601625

I did not know that he had given so much of his time and money for Jamaica and Africa.  He cared about all people and you could tell by the music he produced.

It goes into a fair amount of detail about his white father, including a riveting segment in which they play Bob's ""Cornerstone"" song for his white cousin, explaining to him that Bob was inspired to write the lyrics after the white Marleys refused to loan Bob money for a car.  Also surprising given that the film is a Tuff Gong production, it doesn't portray Bob as a saint . . , one of his daughters says that if she were her mother, she wouldn't have tolerated his infidelities.  Even if Bob's life doesn't interest you, the lush shots of Jamaica and colorful Rastas will enchant you.",1368662400,,681,4.565573770491803

5104068,5,B007PVHANM,"All I can say is WOW!

Kevin MacDonald did an excellent job of portraying Bob Marley's life.
He shared a lot with the people who did not really know Bob.

I watched this movie/documentary twice & it moved me so much.
It made me; sing; shout; dance; be happy; be sad; & my eyes filled up with tears from knowing what Bob went through in his life time trying to make the world a better place for all.

I thought there was one down side to the movie/documentary. I think all of his childen should have been a part of it but maybe they had their own personal reasons for not contributing. In all, it is still a great movie/documentary.

Bob left behind a great legacy!!! And his children are carrying it on for him.

If you are a collector of movies & documentaries, this is a must have for your collection.

I must say that his music had some influence on my especially his more ""conscious"" lyrics. I'm a cable technician by profession and was in a customer's home when we go to talking and he was ""going on and on"" about the movie. He knew much more than me. Then I saw the preview for the movie and thought that this is something definitely worth seeing. I thought I knew Bob Marley but after seeing this movie I barely knew anything. This documentary is the real deal. I enjoyed it quite a lot.

His father's well to do family, threw Bob's mother and him out onto the street when they asked for help. At the time, his father's family owned the largest construction company in Jamaica, now the only reference to them ever existing is through the song created by the child that they cast aside. Bob Marley is most certainly one of the 5 greatest musicians of all time and this story will help further that legacy.",1366156800,,492,4.53932584269663

I have watched many other stories of his life history, but none captured the essence of how his life impacted particularly those around him.  I always wondered why the Wailers departed; how Rita felt about his numerous ""baby-mothers"" and from all the reggae artist in Jamaica, why was he so much more popular.  Now I know

Music tracks through the feature spanned his first to last recordings.  It is 3 hours long and it felt like 30-minutes.  Whether you have seen several other biographies or none, this is must-see TV for casual and hard core fans of Marley",1365724800,,630,4.530973451327434

5104108,5,B007PVHANM,"If you never thought about where reggae came from but you just know that the sound speaks to your inner chill, this movie will open your eyes to how lucky you are that Robert Marley was ever born. It begins where else but at the beginning of his life in St. Anne, the country side of Jamaica. Bob's experience of growing up neither white nor black allowed him the unique perspective of third person in a family, town and country. This point of view about life nearly killed him as he tried to unite Jamaica during a tumultuous political time in the small Island country's history. Robert (Bob) Marley will remain larger than life and the face of reggae music for the rest of history. More importantly this movie will help future generations know that he should be remembered as the most influential human being of our time.",1365638400,,823,4.5675675675675675

The production value is positively divine. They clearly spent tons of time and money producing this, which really shows a clear respect for the film's subject. I was raised on Bob Marley, so I like to think I know more than the average teenage girl about him. I learned a ton, and I was really pleasantly surprised by that.

5104112,5,B007PVHANM,I really enjoyed this movie. The scenery was breathtaking and the movie was very informative. Some of the iconic pictures of Bob Marley shown against the backdrop of his life and the political realities of his world make an interesting juxtaposition that we tend to forget about in America. We hear the words and remember the smile but forget the tyranny and bloodshed.,1365552000,,369,4.873015873015873

With great regret I have to confirm that even after returning the first copy of Marley that I received (as non-playable!) - I received a replacement Marley DVD that I, again, had to return as unplayable.  I have, before making this order for Marley, very recently updated my dvd player, and all dvd's run very well on my new system - so, the fault is with the actual Marley DVD!!!

I got to know a little more about Bob Marley.
I've always known about him and am familiar with his music but I have never really known the man he was.
This Documentary gave me a little in-depth review of who he was.

I was touched when after an assination/murder attempt on his life(which he got shot) he still went on and performed on stage days later in bandages and Joined in hands two rival political leaders on stage..(Beautifully Amazing).

Though he was a bit promiscuous, the women didn't seem to mind at all
Seems like they all knew about his promiscuity and accepted it.....If they didn't mind...why should we.

Great Man who died too soon.
I believe he could have been a Great Leader.

Love how they really broke down his life story and you get to follow this well put together timeline of his journey. For me, it trumped a lot of the negative rumors I had heard over the years about him, and the message he sent through his music is how he truly felt.

It's rather long for a documentary, but there's never a moment of 'when is this thing going to end'. Watched it on a date night, the two of us have been listening to his music non-stop since!

5104186,5,B007PVHANM,"""Marley,"" the most recent documentary about the life and work of Bob Marley, is perhaps the best documentary so far about the reggae superstar and Rastafarian missionary, and an absolute must-see for all reggae fans.  Interviews with Marley's family, friends and close associates provide rare insights into his life and character, not only as a world-famous entertainer and musical evangelist, but as a human being.

Unfortunately, ""Marley"" omits one of the best radio interviews with Bob Marley, the one done by Mumia Abu-Jamal for WUHY in Philadelphia during Marley's 1979 ""Survival"" tour.  Unlike corporate ""mainstream"" journalists, who recounted Marley's multiple relationships with women and sensationalized Marley's sacramental use of ganja (marijuana), Abu-Jamal focused on Marley's lyrical messages of African unity and resistance to oppression, and traced the spiritual roots of the Rastafarian movement in Marcus Garvey's back-to-Africa movement and the culture of the Maroons, Jamaican slaves who fled the plantations and established an independent society in the mountains.

Although it is always saddening to be reminded of the tragic end to Bob Marley's too-short life, perhaps the most disturbing moment in the film occurs when Rita Marley mentions that the cancer in Bob's foot developed AFTER SOMEONE STEPPED ON HIS FOOT WITH A SPIKED BOOT during a soccer game.  This suggests that, rather than merely succumbing to a deadly combination of genetic and environmental factors, Bob Marley may actually have been murdered.  Considering the previous attempt on his life, and the murderous history of the CIA and American imperialism, this is horrifying but should hardly be surprising.  As Marley himself said (in ""Redemption Song""), ""How long shall they kill our prophets while we stand aside and look?""",1360627200,,1816,5.534296028880866

5104228,5,B007PVHANM,So far the tablet has been really fun along with helpfull. I origanly got it so that my wife could access etc. That takes away the time we spend together. Our Fun is all the way of the house. Often I found it isolated. This smart thing has allowed us along with myself less restricted or confined to the back on wich it displays me. I have never even manipulated a befor. I always thought they were very limited and could not perform the average tasks. However I have been proven wrong. Surfing !!!!,1354924800,,499,4.319148936170213
5104229,2,B007PVHANM,"I want to say that I love the man's music a great deal. I also wish to say I seriously looked forward to seeing this film. Sound-wise, the b/w film REALLY shouldv'e been remastered and visually cleaned up in spots. Even minor noise reduction anyone has in the house could have and should have easily been done, but wasn't. However, the later, color video; ""Is this love?"" came out super-nice acoustically. This is being played on a Samsung HDTV with KRK Rokit 5 power speakers--low-cost, nice, flat response speakers for studio playback.

As for that above-mentioned track, the microphone looks to be a Shure 81, which is an odd choice for singing. Normally used as drum overheads. But it sounds well by then. It gives me hope to see a man with a REAL hard upbringing, look so happy. It makes me sad to see him be married and lie about it on tape, and lie to women, enslaving them as his own people were enslaved. There were 11 children with 7 women. I knew this before, so it doesn't color my view of the film. It can't change how I feel about the music, but I'm always looking for a true hero.

I can't figure out why he was so intent on a black audience when his father was white. What does that matter? Maybe  it was the white folks who needed his message more, about solidarity.

""Could you be loved?"" REALLY needed even minor remastering. I could do it here at home on a limiter/gate worth less than 500.00. However, I realize I'm a snob, much more so than 90 percent of the normal population.

I think it could have lost quite a bit of time, personally. He went to bed hungry. Seriously hungry. It could've been cut short, ""Here's what poverty looks like where Bob grew up."" I wanted to see more concert footage, and I REALLY wanted to see subtitles, as the accents are very hard for me to understand, personally. It took me DAYS to understand people when I was IN Jamiaca; great place if you're going somewhere. Each island is a bit different, so I get thrown for days. But I really love it. Nowhere in the world like it, truly.

Camera-wise, I'd like to have seen the whole band, and especially the drummer. Not just Bob.

I have some old cd's and I had to play with them for noise-reduction purposes, unfortunately.

I liked how he mattered so  much to other people. How his music matters so much. How he was able to give hope. No one with an easy life can give you hope.

I judge movies based partially on how much I personally am interested in the subject, but a REALLY good movie SHOULD suck you in, even if you hate all other movies on that subject. I hate mafia movies, but I love ""Casino."" That's the only movie like that I can stand. I was never big on the Carpenters until I accidentally caught a documentary on them, and had to see the rest of it. I cried watching it, and I never owned a Carpenters album until after I saw that film. She was a PHENOMENAL drummer that no one knew about. She never played on a hit album, but she SHOULD and COULD have. Easily.

Towards the end, talking about his cancer and death, the film gets more of my attention. I don't care about the politics. I don't even care about hearing about cancer. But how it affects him gets very interesting.

Sad how so many valuable people are dead of cancer. People who are true lights of the world. Sad how people took advantage of his money; how generous he was. How sad his eyes are in one of his last photos, how scared.

The credits end with ""Three little birds,"" which never fails to make me tear up. ""Don't worry, 'bout a thing, 'cuz every little thing's gonna be alright..."" Hope. That's what this man's music says to me.",1354233600,5,3617,4.3486646884272995

5104242,5,B007PVHANM,"Last summer I found myself wanting to own some Marley music, and purchased the soundtrack without being familiar with the DVD itself.  I enjoyed the music so much, I later came across the DVD on Netflix and watched it, all 2 and a half hours, with rapt attention.  The DVD pays tribute to his life, music, & religion.  It is full of concert footage, and goes a little bit into the history and political strife in Jamaica central to his music.  I don't normally have the patience for DVD commentary, but I was so taken by Marley's life story, I watched it a second time through with commentary by Kevin MacDonald and Ziggy Marley, and was then moved to tears by the end.  The commentary was excellent and is recommended, and creates a more intimate glimpse into Marley's life.  His life ended too young, but the joy he created lives on all over the world.  This DVD is so rich in special features you will want to spend an extra night watching them after the documentary is through.  Previously I only knew of the music from the popular songs on the radio; having watched the DVD and purchased the soundtrack has broadened my understanding of his life and his influence on the world that continues today and his legacy that will live on.",1351296000,7,1236,4.511210762331839

She and I truly enjoyed Marley's music but were amazed to learn about his very humble beginnings and all of the political unrest in Jamaica (didn't know about it).  Really made me appreciate Bob Marley the man and peacemaker as well as his amazing music!  A must for anyone who only loves the music, let's you really get inside the man (a very amazing man at that).",1350864000,,487,4.148936170212766

This is absolutely THE best depiction of his life and certainly the most thorough that I have seen. I really appreciated the producer's successful attempt to humanize Bob, beyond the spiff smoking music master that we always see him shown as.  He was a powerful being with the best of intentions for humanity, without regard for race.  His life is a testament for how we should all put our beliefs into action.  Anybody who wants to get an understanding of who this man really was, watch Marley and you'll find him.  I cried at the end.",1349654400,,627,4.621621621621622
5104253,5,B007PVHANM,"I really, really, really (did I mention REALLY) enjoyed this documentary on Bob Marley. There were so many different things I had no knowledge about but learned from watching this documentary. Most people seemed to want all the meat and potatoes regarding the assassination attempt, the bands conflict(s) (if present) to the separation of two of the members which was not addressed in detail. I felt the overall tone of this documentary was to provide a positive outlook on the man, the music n the legend not to divulge on the negative. The above situations most people were hoping to get greater in depth insight on (Bunny Wailer & Peter Tosh splitting off from the Wailers, etc.) were alluded to or mentioned briefly but never went into great lengths which can be deemed positive or negative by many; especially big Marley fans. I myself wished the director did decide to go there but  can see why he went the course he did. I mean there are many books out there on Bob and the Wailers for those wishing to get the who/why and what. The movie has wetted my appetite to know more (which I think was their goal to do so its been accomplished). I plan on buying this DVD (as I streamed it from Amazon as a Prime Member) and also a book or two to find out more on his formative years with the Wailers and thereafter. I would and have suggested for any Marley lover to watch this film.

I do have one gripe though, I'm an islander...I know the patois. I wished I could've been able to turn off the damn subtitle as I couldn't focus on what was being said because my eyes were being constantly drawn to the subtitle. I don't know if there's an option on the DVD to do so but I hope so.

Oh and those who are griping about lack of concert video footage there are other videos out there for purchase on his concerts. This is not a concert video documentary showing nothing but. However, if you want to know what motivated Nesta Robert Marley, about his life growing up in Jamaica, his families (mother and father's) influence, the faith Bob embraced; Rastafari & promoted, what motivated Bob, his life and work ethics then this is the film to watch. And even if you've read and seen everything there is already on Bob, I'd say watch this too.

In laymans terms...this movie is about the man, the music & the legend; Bob Marley. It is not about not going to school, smoking ganja and having a bunch of kids. Its about the choices one man made in his struggle to come to terms with his life, his religion and his love of music. Nesta Robert Marly has spread Reggae and the Rastafari movement ALL around the world. There isn't a nation who does not know who Bob Marley is, his music crosses boundaries and cultures. His message is simple...one love.",1349654400,,2741,4.4541832669322705

A few key things like his honoring by the United Nations were left out but we got a well balanced portrait of the man.  Of course it is the music that shines through as the star - they did a great job with that!  One Love and ongoing positvibes to the world from Bob.,1349568000,,329,3.8805970149253732

When I saw Manley and Seaga shake hands at the ""One Love"" concert I almost fell off my couch. There is so much power behind One Love. It was even able to bring two rivals together if only for a moment. If we all, a conscious people worked together, world wide, is it possible to have....One Love?",1348617600,,424,4.379746835443038

1. Failing to deal with Marley's other children is now a problem when documenting bob's life. it would have been great to hear from julian,kymani, robbie etc.

2. Way too much time on cindy breakspeare and bob. We have heard this story in every documentary made.

The music industry today is in shambles, but for anyone that thinks they are fighting a tough road, this documentary will give you hope. It also stands in sharp contrast with the kind of excesses and narcissistic actions of today's vapid pop stars, many of whom could not find a cause they care anything about other than what color to paint their nails.  Marley will live on as will other great artists, while the buffoons of today get forgotten, though arguably not soon enough for my taste.

That is something that I have not seen alot of. Also loved the commentary from Rita, Ziggy, Cedella, and the various people that worked with or knew Bob. I thought there was a perfect mix of interviews and performances. The best part for me, something that I haven't heard alot about before, was the last few months of his life.

5104300,3,B007PVHANM,In my opinion the movie is quite chaotic and long. The background story has not been structured together specially for those of us who do not know much about his life.

5104302,5,B007PVHANM,Not only is this an excellant documentary on the life of Bob Marley.  It also fills you in on the history of the Rastafarian Religion in Jamaica.  The suprise is the development of the recording industry in that country.  Plus they introduce you to all of the other artist and record people of that era and the political climate they created in.  I have viewed it again and again.  Well worth the price!!!!,1346630400,,406,4.506849315068493
5104303,4,B007PVHANM,"Given the length of the film, it seems oddly hollow at times.  I was left still having no idea what the core of Bob Marley was like.  His political views (other than cynical) were obscured, his personal relationships were confusing.  What mattered to him?  The only truly clear point I emerged with was that Bob Marley wanted his musical career to succeed, he wanted to conquer markets worldwide and was upset that his music was not embraced by African Americans.  And that he was ""tough"", and felt alienated for a variety of reasons.  He loved children, it was said, but seemed to have little time to spend with at least some of them. That's hardly unusual for driven men, but given Marley's apparent rejection of ""western"" family structure, it's kind of troubling.  Surely his children were hurt by his behavior, and he seemed to spread himself awfully thin in terms of personal commitments.  Furthermore, there are many questions about some of the most important events in his life.  A few are alluded to by Ziggy Marley.

Who was really behind the assassination attempt?  What happened to those who did the shooting?  And who on earth was giving Marley medical advice?  He appeared to have no appropriate treatment for the melanoma that was diagnosed on his foot, guaranteeing that it would reappear in metastases and be ultimately fatal.  And when he had a seizure from the cancer spreading to his brain, someone advised him to just continue performing??  Clearly someone was terrified of losing potential income and momentum but who?  Was it Marley himself?  Chris Blackwell?  Those in his entourage?  Why did the Wailers really break up?  Was it the reluctance of two of the members (Tosh and Bunny Livingston) to tour, or was it Chris Blackwell's preference for dealing with Marley solo, given his more marketable (e.g. whiter) image?

""Marley"" was a visually gorgeous movie, and it was interesting to hear the story of the musical history of Jamaican reggae.  The interviews with his children, his old teacher, Bunny Wailer, and a few of the Hope Road regulars were interesting.  I found it sad that there was so  little from Rita Marley, who must have a lot more to say.  I found the movie visually lovely and thought provoking but ultimately unsatisfying because the obviously elusive central focus remained, to me anyway, still unfathomable.",1346198400,9,2353,4.911167512690355
5104304,3,B007PVHANM,"Scottish director Kevin MacDonald has created a long-winded biographical documentary in ""Marley"", which follows the life of reggae star Bob Marley from his childhood in the country village of Nine Mile, Jamaica until his death from cancer in Miami in 1981 at age 36. We see his youth in Kingston through the eyes of friends and bandmates, his success with The Wailers, his conversion to the Rastafari movement, international success and rifts within the band, their African concerts, and growing popularity in the United States. The roster of people interviewed for this film is enormous, and, in some sense, it is nice to hear these people's perspective, but the 40 or so interview subjects contribute to the film's general lack of focus and limp tone.

We get a decent overview of who Bob Marley was, how he came to fame, and the influence he had. But, at nearly 2  hours long, it's almost shocking that we don't get more than that. ""Marley"" touches on issues of Marley's driven personality, his music, his family, his politico-religious beliefs, his involvement in Jamaican politics, the evolution of The Wailers and of Marley's career, but it presents a smattering of information on these topics. Nothing ever crystallizes. There is never enough depth to convey an understanding of Marley's relationship with these themes beyond the fact that he did them. Even when addressing a specific event, such as Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer's split from the band in 1974, we get a fuzzy explanation that avoids controversy.

Kevin MacDonald seems not to know what he wants to say about Bob Marley. This is surprising, as his fiction films have not lacked focus. Many of the interviews included in the film have no relevance. It could have easily been edited down to 1 hour 45 minutes. I'm sure MacDonald had a huge amount of footage that could have been fashioned into a good film, if only he and the editor had a clear idea of what they were trying to convey. As it is, ""Marley"" is a bunch of interviews cobbled together that left me with only a superficial understanding of Bob Marley, his career, and his legacy. I was surprised at the paltry concert footage, as well, as Marley was so dynamic in concert. Marley was a driven, energetic man, but this film is overlong, tedious, and for all the talk, doesn't say much.",1345334400,9,2314,4.794486215538847
5104305,4,B007PVHANM,"While I have no complaint with the quality of this film, I do object to the cheap, flimsy ""recyclable"" snapcase.  I hope this isn't a trend.

The Dvd was informative and filled with touching tributes.  Enjoyed hearing songs from the early days and seeing how things evolved.  The film was really done well, portraying him as a great musician, but also as just a man.  Brought tears to my eyes to see how he suffered.  PEACE BOB!!!!!!

5104307,5,B007PVHANM,I have read numerous books on the life of Bob Marley but nothing compares to Marley the movie. It is breath taking and spiritual journey into the life of Nesta. Highly recommended!,1344816000,,180,4.65625
5104308,5,B007PVHANM,"Being a massive Bob fan, it shouldn't have taken me this long to see this documentary, but in my defense I really was not expecting any new facts, performance footage or interviews to be revealed.  After viewing, I have to say that I was very pleasantly surprised at what additonal footage they were able to get that wasn't already in other Bob documentaries.

Interviews with unknown (to me) family members were very interesting.  I loved it when his half-sister was asked to listen to Cornerstone and how she immediately interpreted it's meaning.  I was surprised though that only Ziggy and Cedella were interviewed from all his children.  Nice new interviews though with Bunny and his obvious delight to talk about early Wailers.

As far as performance clips, most I have seen before.  Maybe a couple of live clips that I haven't or possibly forgotten about.  But no matter how many times I see it, the One Love concert clip where Bob is just going crazy with the dancing is amazing!

The sad ending is very emotional.  I hadn't seen some of the photos from the clinic in Germany.  This is a man though whose legacy will continue to live on and thanks to this documentary insofar as it's part to help maintain that.",1344816000,,1218,4.671361502347418

Enjoyed the presence of many of the people in the video.  Excellent job of capturing much of the flavor... if there had been smell-ivision and ganga, then the experience would have been 100%.  Oh for a Jamaican patty on the street in front of the studio.  These people were very nice to me, a young man from america.  40 years later, I am thankful for the experience.
One commenter said something about all reggae being the same, and to that I say, I feel sorry for you, reggae is a rainbow...  Ah, but are there colors to the color-blind?",1344729600,,694,4.4603174603174605

I have all of Bob Marley's work, from the dvd's to all records and live work and I am happy to add this to my collection.  This is something that I want to pass down to my kids and let them know, just how important this man was on the world of music, peace and culture!

I see some people talking about it was too long, or I wish it were a concert film....go get you a Bob Marley and the Wailers live at the Rainbow DVD and let the rest of us learn more about the man that some of us idolize.",1344556800,,754,4.074324324324325

5104315,5,B007PVHANM,"As a life-long fan of Bob Marley,this DVD was a must-see,must-hear,must-feel experience for me...I couldn't wait!
The movie gives me a new perspective on Bob,his family,music & life. It was a roller coaster of emotions and such great insight from those who knew him best. I will share this with as MANY people I can,because even all these years after his death(which I remember like it was yesterday),the 'Legend' lives on and we cannot forget Bob's contribution to this planet, One love, peace & blessings...",1344470400,,509,5.0
5104316,5,B007PVHANM,I have to agree with all of the positive comments on this documentary. This is the absolute best documentary that I have have seen on Bob Marley. I watched it with someone that wasn't aware of Marley's history and gained a new respect for the music and the man.,1344470400,,261,4.346938775510204
5104317,3,B007PVHANM,"I fear I am being kind giving this movie three stars; it is really too long and a bit of travesty. First, what is good about the movie--it has SOME (but no where near enough) concert footage and some great interviews with Bunny Wailer and even a short interview with Lee Scratch Perry. And what is both good and bad about the movie--it has a way too short interview with Familyman Barrett, which is good and leaves one wanting more. It was also fun to see Marley's kids all grown and Rita Marley.

But you could have bottled the good stuff and had a movie half the length. (I wouldn't have been bothered if they had stretched out the movie to the same length with concert footage--in fact, that movie would have been a 5 star movie in my opinion.)

What was wrong with the movie:

1) WAYYYY to many interviews with Bob Marley's white male cousin (brother?) who played no real role in his actual life. Boring and irrelevant.

2) WAYYYY too many interviews with the ex-Miss Universe that Marley had a fling with the in 1979s, Cindy Breakspeare (I think I got the name right). She is also white; so Marley liked a pretty woman? He must have slept with hundreds (AT LEAST!) and there is no particular reason to bore me with one.

3) And this is most important--Chris Blackwell--who is a vampire&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Judgement-In-A-Babylon/dp/B004ZNJ5XG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Judgement In A Babylon</a>&nbsp;chose to market Bob Marley and the Wailers as a solo act (not as the Wailers, which is how they were viewed in Jamaica). This may have been a factor in the break up of the Wailers, which is a crime. IT also creates an historical inaccuracy--that Bob Marley is some strange unique musical genius. Blackwell knew better and he also knew he couldn't market the whole genre reggae to white rock fans--so he didn't try very hard. Thus the movie basically ignores the wider world of Jamaican music to try and sell the lie of the unique Robert Nesta Marley. I really missed Bunny Wailer in the movie after the Wailers broke up and kept wondering about Peter Tosh--and they were Marley's brothers! (Wailer quite literally)

When I left the theatre, I discussed the movie with the popcorn seller. He looked a bit embarrassed to admit it, as he is a hip young white dude, but he said he thought maybe Marley wasn't interesting enough to support a movie that long. That is not quite the problem--by including so much material peripherial to WHO Marley was and WHAT it meant to be an international Rastafarian superstar--the movie actually manages to drag many times.

I personally would recommend against buying a DVD of this movie (though, as I noted, I haven't seen the DVD and if it is filled with all sorts of awesome concert footage they didn't include in the regular movie, I could be wrong); if you want to see it, I would upload it for a single viewing--I'd be vaguely surprised if you watched the whole thing if you weren't trapped in a theatre.",1344384000,6,3005,4.789575289575289

5104320,5,B007PVHANM,"NOBODY can say one bad thing about this film. BOB MARLEY is the KING of all artists. This movie shows that he was never motivated by money. All he ever wanted was; ""for MANKIND to live as ONE....black, white, Chinese,""

Marley did not measure wealth by stuff, and bank accounts..he measured it by ""LIFE"".

People would come to 56 HOPE ROAD asking for money for dem pickney, medical bills, food, rent...and BOB stood there and gladly handed out his earnings....he did not ""dweet, for tax deductions, he did it because he never forgot his roots.

This movie is a MUST HAVE. I would give it 10 STARS, but 5 was the limit.

""HAILE SELASSIE IS THE CHAPEL"", is the tune the movie ends with....wait and see. I do not want to ruin it for those who have yet to see it. One love and more LIFE ~",1344124800,3,784,4.312925170068027

I can't wait for this Blu-ray to change the world, even if only a little bit, then Bob's message was true. There is nothing false about this great man, prophet, life-living rastafarian. Our ""civilized"" way of life could really benefit from more people like Mr. Marley!

5104322,5,B007PVHANM,"""Marley""  is a documentary about reggae king, Bob Marley, that covers the musician's life with emphasis on the personal over the political.  Director Kevin Macdonald (""The Last King of Scotland"") provides a portrait of Marley's upbringing as mixed-race child in the slums of Jamaica plagued by an almost-always absent father and poverty. His rise to prominence and fame is traced. However, this isn't a concert film.  Instead, Macdonald offers interviews with family members, musician friends and politicians, and relies for visuals on archival footage and still photos.

When his mother moved to Kingston, Marley turned to music and the Rastafari religion.  He incorporated his spiritual views -- far from the mainstream of the time -- into both American-style pop melodies and Jamaican ska music.  He is credited with turning reggae into a worldwide sensation.

Marley became a vocal advocate of political peace in Jamaica, was once targeted for assassination, and was shot after a political squabble. He dated a white beauty queen while remaining married to one of his black back-up singers, and fathered 11 children with seven women. All this while selling millions of record albums.

Macdonald provides an objective look at Marley.  We see many facets of a complex man and realize that Marley, driven primarily by humanistic rather than commercial goals, was far more than just a pop star of the 70's.

Special features on the Blu-ray release include extended interviews with Marley's friends and colleagues, photo gallery, audio commentary, and reminiscences by Marley's children.",1343520000,,1586,5.358870967741935

His music connects spiritually to people all over the world and transcends people from all walks of life. The music is timeless, and universal, and will continue to move people for a time of times and half of a time. This documentary reveals a lot about the man, but not enough. You can never finish talking about Robert Nesta Marley. The king is dead, long live the king.",1342742400,,447,4.451219512195122
5104325,5,B007PVHANM,"One of the most exhaustively-researched biographical docus I've ever seen, and nary a moment of its two-plus-hour runtime is wasted. Packed with honest, revealing, enlightening face-to-face chats with every major player in Bob Marley's story, this candid tell-all effectively captures the social impact of his work on-stage and in-studio, along with the intimate details of his private life. It doesn't take much prodding to realize that before we can fully comprehend one, we must also understand the other. Dedicated apostles of the icon should welcome the personal insights, while more passive appreciators are bound to be staggered by the power of his voice on multiple levels - musical, political, religious and intellectual. Warm, complex and genuine, just like its subject - I can appreciate his work on a whole new level today.",1341187200,3,835,5.333333333333333

5104328,5,B007PVHANM,This was a great and informative documentary. I am only sad that they took out so much to get the movie to 2 1/2 hours (read that in an interview with the director). I would've gladly sat in the  theater for another half hour of looking into his life! This documentary gave me chills at some points and brought me to sadness in the end because we lost such an influential and great man. The only other disappointing thing is that I would've loved to see interviews from all his children...but it is still worth watching again!,1340236800,3,526,4.422680412371134

This film soothed my soul by allowing me to understand not only the music but the man and all the positive people with him that brought reggae music to the world.

Seeing this theatrical documentary renewed my love for Bob and the importance of continuing to spread his message of peace, love, and unity. As an educator his message really speaks volumes to me because I am in an important role. I have the opportunity to teach young people today about Bob's message through education. His picture hangs in my classroom close to my desk and each year the students inquire as to who he is and each year I will continue to tell them about BOB MARLEY!!!!

Visits to the Bob Marley museum hint at a lot of what is revealed in the documentary but I think this film provides more of an understanding of the reasons behind the music.  I rented the movie and now I intend to buy it and I don't feel like I've wasted a penny.  Enough really cannot be said about how honest this film was and how authentic the people portrayed were.  I did chuckle a couple times when I saw Jamaicans being Jamaicans but I think this added to the honesty of the documentary.

5104337,5,B007PVHANM,"Really well researched and well done - the best and most honest Bob film, and possibly the best reggae doc there is. Some particular strong points include talking with and about Bob's extended family on the Marley side - everything else on Bob always simplifies this side of things. Bunny was also uncharacteristically forthcoming, although I thought a bit more about Tosh would have helped. A final nitpick - showing Channel One while talking about Studio 1... hmmmmm

Some very real and raw footage is used to take you into the life and the man that was Bob Marley. I would recommend this to ANY Marley fan or someone that is interested in him and his music. Bunny Wailer is great in this. And his kids give accurate and honest accounts of growing up with Marley. So sit back with a some mellow mood tea and enjoy this beautiful movie.,1336867200,4,528,4.12621359223301
5104349,5,B007PVHANM,"Unlike most of the garbage Hollywood is producing these days (stupid sequels, unoriginal stories, PG13 watered down crap and on and on), this movie really stands out. I love the line where Bob is asked if he is rich. ""Are you a rich man? Do you have a lot of possessions?"" and he answers ""possessions make you rich? I don't have that kind of richness""

What a touching movie. A+++

I don't even write very many music or movie reviews (even if I love a film), but this was simply so magnificent I felt compelled to speak on it. Seriously, I'm not gonna make a point to go into some long drawn out review b/c, others truly have summed up far more succulently everything I could say about this. But best believe if you're a Bob fan this is truly a MUST SEE! Heck, even if you don't know much about him and his music you NEED to learn yourself up on this and watch. I actually didn't realize there was a documentary out for at least a full week after its initial release, though ironically I had been listening to (what I later put together as) the OST. And let me tell you, they truly nailed the musical experience in this one (as others have stated)! It was absolutely so enlightening to get such a deep insight on how some of the songs had so much more of a powerful meaning! Not to give anything away, but the segment on his earlier years and the song ""Cornerstone"" was particularly deep and awesome b/c, the true meaning of it was so much more mind-blowingly different than what I had ever imagined that song was! And that's just one example out of many...

I'm dead for real, whether you're a Marley fan, a fan of peace, love, and life--WHATEVER--you simply NEED to watch this!",1336435200,21,1339,4.334661354581673

5104352,5,B007PVHANM,"I have heard and read about the (family-approved) Marley documentary, and as a long time fan of Bob Marley couldn't wait to see this for myself. The movie opened today in Cincinnati, and I was there.

Going into ""Marley"" (145 min.) I wondered whether this movie would be too long, I mean 2 1/2 hours! My fears were unfounded. The movie brings Bob Marley's life chronologically, and the first half of the movie was the most fascinating for me, seeing the (very) humble beginnings of where Marley grew up, being a son of a white man and a black woman who has a brief fling. Even though I am thoroughly familiar with Marley's music, it was a revelation to see his initial musical beginnings, such as hearing his first song (1962's ""Judge Not"", which already documents his social conscience at that early stage). The movie delights non-stop. Other highlights for me were the footage of the 1976 ""political"" free concert in Jamaica, done under great pressures. The footage on stage shows utter chaos around Marley as he performs, just unreal. There are many, many other highlights. The last 20 min. of the movie deal with his battle with cancer, showing pictures and footage I had never seen before. I didn't realize that after his last live performance in Pittsburgh (Sept 1980--that performance is out on an excellent 2 CD called ""Live Forever"", by which time he was already gravely ill, yet put on a great show), Marley moved to Germany for 6 months in a desparate attempt to fight the disease. He flew to Miami in May, 1981 and died 3 days later.

In all, WHAT A MOVIE! Not to be missed by anyone who is a music history buff. I had one chance to see Marley live, when he came to Brussels in 1980 (I grew up in Belgium). My friends and I pondered what to do, we wanted to go but by happenstance, Belgium played the European soccer championship finals that night, surely a once-in-a-lifetime event. We figured we'd catch Marley on his next tour and watched the soccer game on TV. (Belgium lost, and never has advanced to a final since then.) Little did we know Marley would pass away a year later.
