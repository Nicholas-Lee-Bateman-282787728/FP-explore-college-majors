4505026,1,B004Z29WD0,"Having seen this movie I read some reviews on IMdB and here on Amazon. I was truly blown away that anyone could give this garbage a five star rating. The camera work is not inovative or visionary, it's bad. Make your eyes bleed bad. The acting is worse. I'm not sure if the cast had a general idea of what was supposed to be going on and just improvised their dialogue, but if not, I hope they all made enough money to pay for acting lessons. The one HUGE continuity gaff of Woodrow trading his car for a motorcycle in one shot and riding off into the sunset, then seen a few shots later driving the car enroute home again, wearing a sweater vest that he had shed some many scenes before, shows just laziness in the editting process. I don't know why I kept watching except that it was like staring at a circus freak and trying to figure out what was wrong with it and wondering why someone would be so cruel as to put it on display for everyone to ogle and ridicule. I'm just glad I didn't purchase this crap and I hope you don't either.",1321747200,13,1038,4.195
4505027,5,B004Z29WD0,"An abridged version of my review:
Bellflower is badass.

But to go into further detail for those who need more convincing, this film swallows you into a separate existence of envious invention.  Shot on a homemade camera, it follows two dudes as they build homemade flame throwers to attach to their reconstructed apocalyptic car, aptly named Medusa.  The cinematography is mind blowing, with hazes of golden yellow lurking in most scenes, which perfectly compliments the amount of fire and explosions.  In all honesty it's a real bummer that more people haven't seen this, as I fully plan on forcing it onto my friends.  The cars, the flames, the soundtrack (!!!!), the painful demise of a relationship, everything about this film is tangible and personal.  Initially I wanted to see this  because I am a lame girl and I thought it would be an edgy, indie romance sort of vibe, and I liked the homemade aspects of its production.  Instead I found out that I want a flame thrower.  And a car with a secret whiskey spout for mid-ride pick me ups.  But instead I just got the movie on dvd.",1321401600,16,1087,4.673684210526316

4505030,5,B004Z29WD0,"I have seen a lot of indy movies over the years....few have been great and many have been contrived and without good cohesion.  I didn't have unrealistic expectations going into the movie.  I thought it would be good but nothing more.  I was pleasantly surprised that it was so amazing.  I don't personally identify with the characters or the plot, yet I empathize.  The acting was extremely organic, yet not directed and produced in a cheap, film-student-esque way.  This film is so low budget yet it packs the punch of a billion dollar film.  My hat is off to the cast and the producer and editor.  The music is on point as well.  Everything is just about perfect in this movie.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.  It reminded me of when I saw Aronofsky's first films' ""Pi"" and ""Requiem for a dream"".  I just instantly connected and was immersed.  Same thing happened here, but I liked Bellflower even more than Aranofsky's films (forgive me Darren I still love your work).",1315872000,3,978,4.551724137931035
4505031,5,B004Z29WD0,"I'm closely related to Bellflower's director so you'd think I'd know a lot about it, but while I saw it and commented on it along the way ,the final film was a complete mystery and surprise to me. This title is not yet available on DVD but I saw it at Sundance in a preview screening. I entered the theater in Park City with a mixture of trepidation and hope and with no pre-formed bias. That is, I'd already rehearsed in my head how to act if I hated it. While there are often small differences between previews and final releases they are probably small, so I think that what I saw is close to the eventual DVD release. The first part of the film feels like a brutally accurate portrayal of 20-something LA life in the large bohemian population of wannabe and soon-to-be artists and actors here. A switch is flipped at the halfway point that takes the train completely off the tracks. I left the screening with the profound feeling that I had witnessed a small but seismic shift in the language of the cinema. Whether you will love it or hate it (not too likely) I think you will be glad that you saw it and own it. The visual language and dramatic structure are strikingly fresh. Watch it.",1311811200,2,1192,4.373873873873874

4505086,2,B004Z29WD0,"An excruciatingly pedestrian (High School) student film with some interesting ideas and a few nice FX.

I couldn't sit through this movie. After the first 40 minutes of holding my breath I gave up and started skipping through scenes.
There are at least 30 minutes in this movie that could have been a three minute montage. Even the good takes are edited just a little too loose - allowing your focus to drift.

Every camera shot is from the same (MAYBE steadycam) chest height with almost no variation of angle/tilt (not even a ""hero shot"").
The above issues are not a result of low budget; but instead a lack of artistic vision. It seems unlikely that the director/editor had any film school training, as these issues are very basic.

If you care to know about the story itself...
Where the hell do they get comparisons to John Hughes from? Ok I'll humor that for a moment: Imagine Ferris Bueller but with worst actors you've ever seen and none of the perfectly on-trend music/montage? Sucks right? It's possible that a real name actor could have carried this film in the way Joseph Gordon-Levitt carries slow parts of ""Brick"" (yes that film had more premeditated vision as well)... but it wouldn't save the film from dragging. There is just too much non-essential dialog.

Boy meets girl, boy reveals that he makes cool gadgets, boy enters conflicts with girl's social group, boy becomes murderous anti-hero baddass... Could work, right?  It doesn't and it comes off as transparently masturbatory on the part of the filmmakers.

The whole thing reads as ""poorly planned and executed wish-fulfillment movie by insecure flyover-state-suburbanite sissies"".

But a couple montages and we might not see it so clearly- it could have been truly ""Mad Max""-esque.",1448928000,,1756,4.932203389830509

4505202,5,B004Z29WD0,"When I saw previews for this movie before it released on blu ray and DVD, I thought it might be a nice low budget indie film to check out. After all, I enjoyed watching the Mad Max trilogy as a kid and watch them every once and a while now as an adult. I watched Bellflower one morning  half way paying attention and the more the movie went on, the more attention I payed to what was going on.

As far as my taste in movies goes, I like a little action, a little romance, a little suspense, and a plot that isn't predictable. Bellflower did this on a new level with cinematography unlike any I had ever seen. Finding out that the director had actually built the camera himself, I can understand why now.  After I watched it one time, I couldn't wait to watch it again to catch what I had missed during the first watch.

As many reviews and descriptions state, the plot follows 2 characters, Woodrow and Aiden. Woodrow and Aiden are roommates and best friends who are obsessed with the film Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior. I say Mad Max 2 because Lord Hummungus is mentioned and he isn't in any of the other Mad Max movies. As you can see in the movie, they live dirty, they look dirty, and it seems like they don't have any real jobs, but to question their income to me would take away from the plot. To put it plainly they get by on what they have which isn't much. But they do spend their days building a replica flamethrower and car from Mad Max 2. To me, I see this as something to make life enjoyable for these 2 and it also leads to some very interesting scenes. Anyway, Woodrow and Aiden are Mad Max 2 enthusiasts by day and drinking buddies by night. They meet Milly and Courtney at a bar and things go up hill for a bit and then take a dramatic turn and just when you think the movie is about to get to it's absolute climax, the twist comes in leaving you with one thought, ""What the hell just happened?!"" And then it sinks in.

Because Bellflower combines so many of my favorite qualities in one movie, it is hands down one of my top favorite movies that I've ever seen. It captivated me. it made me angry, it gave me goosebumps, and it blew my mind.",1424044800,,2157,4.175480769230769

4505227,5,B004Z29WD0,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Bellflower"" [USA, 2011]

1. I usually find romantic dramas to be predictable and boring. But this movie is a rare exception.

2. Its about two best friends, Aiden and Woodrow, who moved to California together to make their lives different. They spend their spare time (which they have a lot of) fantasizing about what they would do during the apocalypse. They build Mad Max-inspired cars and flamethrowers as their hobby.

3. Woodrow falls in love with a girl named Milly, and Aiden starts spending time with a girl named Courtney. They embark on their respective relationships, which are realistic and heartfelt. But halfway through the movie, things go bad. There is cheating, car accidents, brain damage, and betrayal.

4. The last half hour of the movie splits into two different timelines, and it is up to you to decide which one is the real one and which one is imaginary.

5. The movie works largely because of the two lead actors. Tyler Dawson plays Aiden and Evan Glodell plays Woodrow (Glodell also wrote and directed the movie). Its one of the best portrayals of adult male best friends Ive ever seen. They perfectly illustrate the young adult male psyche dealing with love, friendship, and the realization that idealism rusts away, that changing where you live doesn't change who you are.

6. The cinematography by Joel Hodge is very unique. Beautiful macro shots combine with dirty lenses and grungy perspectives to give the film a look Ive never seen before. It was nominated for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Cinematography.

7. No matter which version of the timeline you believe, if you watch all the way through the credits you may get confused again.

8. The movie shows that some apocalypses really do happen. But they are not global, they are personal.

9. This movie is a beautiful emo-hipster tragedy, and is further proof that some great movies never make it to your local pop culture movie theater.",1405900800,13,1960,4.861861861861862
4505228,5,B004Z29WD0,Gorgeous film.  The craftsmanship (this was basically shot with a homemade camera) is stunning.  Not to mention Evan Glodell's truly memorable performance as Woodrow....  I'm looking forward to the next Coatwolf production!,1405036800,,223,5.90625

This was an absurd waste of time, and I'm annoyed at myself for having sacrificed 2 hours of my life watching this crap.  It would have been more interesting, and certainly more insightful and entertaining had I watched paint dry on the wall.

One pathetic kid writes, "" You will see yourself in the characters of this move. "" No possibility of this, and I hope the vast majority would agree.  This is a cast of losers, brain-dead, immature, rattled individuals. If this is a good life, there ain't much hope for the future. The characters are a grouping of every sort of socially and emotionally dysfunctional miscreants, showing psychologically  undeveloped actions.

Another female deep intellect writes,  ""Initially I wanted to see this because I am a lame girl.... Instead I found out that I want a flame thrower. And a car with a secret whiskey spout for mid-ride pick me ups. But instead I just got the movie on dvd."" You're kidding, right?  Please tell me you're joking. She actually then bought the DVD? .....like to review it and seek out the deep hidden meanings of life?
Low budget? Beginning film school class would laugh this production back to the drawing board. It could have been filmed in video mode on an iPhone and had a far better cinematic effect.

I would say the mid-part gives a little bit of ""this is too long""... But the beginning catches you pretty well, so it is okay to go through this mid section. Plus you know it's going to break bad by the end, and it's true that the ending is full of tension.
It is an experimental piece and it deserve some knowledge, just because of the way it was produced - but on top of that, that is a pretty good film.",1380326400,,655,4.00763358778626
4505234,4,B004Z29WD0,"This was a very cool movie. Decent acting, great shots and atmosphere and fun to see the flamey, homegrown destructive gadgets & vehicles. I have to give it up, some serious indy spirit of film-making, inspired and driven (sorry).

BUT, I will say, the overall plot of the movie left me a bit stupified and numbed to the characters. No one comes out truly likeable, and seems to only reinforce to the overall vacuousness of hipster Brooklynite ""culture"", which, in its roots consist of spoiled art-hipster-bros bumming Williamsburg. Fortunately, the movie is not set in Brooklyn and comes clean of some that irony streak which makes hipsterdom so detestable. The cognitive-dissonance experienced by the film's key players seems contagious and moves easily to the viewership (I watched it in a group). May be more hipster irony about divested existence brought on by a jaded affect and disgruntled view of modern-day society, hm?

I admire the director's ""jack of all trades"" vision and it's oddly beautiful at moments despite its ""microcosmic apocalypse"", ""appetite for destruction"" narratives. A little more investment to the character development and may be a story arc that doesn't leave you remote, disgusted with humanity, but I have to wonder if that was part of the point. May be my perceptions failed me or may be I have to give it another go. And that's the thing; I don't really want to--I don't want to see this movie again.

4505261,5,B004Z29WD0,"I heard absolutely nothing about this low budget indie film, and from looking at the box it really didn't sound like my kind of film at all . . . in fact, at first glance it really seemed like some sort of lame derivative hipster knockoff with very little going for it at all . . . then, out of curiosity, I finally watched it.  It was NOTHING AT ALL LIKE I EXPECTED.  Wow.  This was a truly GREAT movie in so many ways.

The biggest parts of this film are supposedly the car and the homebuilt flamethrower.  I've been around custom cars all my life and know a few guys who own flamethrowers, so that really was not that big a deal to me, although both were pretty damned cool.  Flamethrowers are a lot more temperamental than one might think, and the one they built was impressive.  Although the car and flamethrower are cool, watch this film for the acting and writing.  Brilliantly executed.

Early into this film, I disliked the main characters -- a pair of alcoholic slackers and a bipolar girl they meet in a pub -- but after 20 minutes they started to grow on me as their personalities unfolded and they became more humanized -- a half hour into it things start to get pretty intense -- then it culminates in a hallucinatory mind-warp that will leave you speechless.  This film will never have mass appeal because too many people just won't be able to understand and appreciate it, but it is destined to remain a cult classic with a dedicated following.  The cast obviously put everything they had into this, and the story is poignant and moving.  The flaws are few, minor, and hardly worth mentioning . . . this was a brilliant film and I recommend it highly.",1359590400,,1667,4.4295081967213115

They attract inept, inarticulate white females going nowhere in their early twenties, and it doesn't go well for any of the parties involved. The film takes its fictions seriously, the plot never strays from where it has to go once the characters are established, and those qualities are admirable.

On the other hand, it only takes a minute to suss out that the two male leads are inept, inarticulate, and going nowhere. Which leaves the viewer with no real plot progression, memorable moments or surprises, flamethrowers notwithstanding. You know before they speak that nothing they say will be poignant, stunning, funny, or anything other than a platitude peppered with f-bombs and dudes. And you know whatever conclusions they draw, daydreams they have or actions they take will be dunderheaded, futile, and likely destructive as well.

Honestly, I can't tell if the writer/director is cleverly commenting on a hipster subculture that has moved beyond fixies to arsenals, or if this is just something not very far from the reality of an inarticulate, inept new filmmaker who doesn't have anything to convey.

4505263,4,B004Z29WD0,"Bellfower is one movie where you do NOT want to turn it off halfway through and assume the rest of the storyline is going to maintain the same carefree teenage relationship-type drama that takes up the first half.  Trust me, the second half is MUCH more suspenseful.  It's about a group of teenage guys that have an interest in creating really outrageous flamethrowers.  These throwers shoot a flame that must be about 30-feet long!  Never seen one so incredible!

Anyway, that's only one aspect of the film.  One of the boys meets a girl in a bar and they seemingly hit off a picture perfect relationship right away.  They travel to Texas together, go on dates, go out to dinner, trades a car for a motorcycle, etc.  This is when you might be tempted to turn the movie off and call it a disappointment, but I can't stress enough how much of a mistake that would be.

As soon as the girl is seen cheating by the boyfriend and the boy gets into an accident, well let's just say, he now has nothing but vengeance on his mind.  He occupies his days in bed being really angry and bitter all the while dealing with the facial scars connected to the accident and the ex-girlfriend responsible for it, so he makes it his personal mission to make her suffer.  Bet you didn't see THAT one coming, haha.  Simply put, the guy has an attitute problem and feels insulted over how the relationship ends.

The best way to describe the second half of Bellflower is total madness.  The one long-haired friend of the ex-girlfriend is SUPER cute!  She plays a really graphic scene later on (that may or may not have actually happened- you'll see what I mean when you watch it) and the flamethrower comes into the picture on one occasion that's related to the storyline, and it's a good one.  Again though, may or may not have really happened.

Lots of fighting, violence, revenge, etc. dominate the second half.  So yes, deal with the uninteresting first half and prepare yourself for total chaos during the second half of Bellflower.  You'll feel so rewarded!",1358380800,,2041,4.573002754820936

One day Woodrow meets a girl named Milly (Jessie Wiseman) while joining in a cricket eating contest. In spite of Milly's warning that she will hurt him, Woodrow starts dating her until the day when, as the film's subtitle says, ""All Things End.""

Maybe I should not tell you much about the film's second half, where you will see some terrible events that might or might not happen. All I can say is that, compared to the first part, of which content is raw and real, the second part is unnecessarily confusing. This part could be much better with a simpler narrative or tighter editing.

Despite the real flame-throwers used in the film, ""Bellflower"" is a drama. Made on a budget of 17,000 dollars, this would be easily characterized as ""one-of-a-kind"" film. The film's orange-tinted photography is unique, to be sure, and so is the black ""Medusa"" car, but the film's story is at its heart a pretty orthodox one, about friendship between males with nowhere to go.

Once my vitamins (and temerity) had been successfully gathered, I watched it another 10-12X before finding the cheapest Blu-Ray I could find (through Amazon, of course), pushed the ""Buy Now"" button and awaited it's delivery daily to see if the film warranted my initial reaction. It did.  Not since ""Searching For The Wrong-Eyed Jesus"" has an Indy film had such a complementary soundtrack that both adds to and keeps the viewers on their collective toes to add to the benefit of the film and help to complete it, too. Far too many films today rely on big-budgeted royalty checks and generalized 'guesses' as to ""well, this song might sound good dropped in here"" in determining their placement, rather than to the overall feel and rhythm of the film, itself.  These independent artists were pure fresh air to me, particularly the Small Town Zeros-""Secrets"", which lent itself to the apocalyptic subtext succinctly.  Let's face it, I was brought up on a diet of the Mad Max films in the mid-80's, where we would have all night Dusk 'til Dawn film festivals in my suburban basement where everyone became suitably lubricated for the festivities as the night wore on- the films' malevolent fight over ""the gas"", the irrefutably galvanizing car culture with it's host of poor-man's but righteous Bond-gadgets to disfigure and disable, and the man himself, ""the Ayatollah of Rock and Rolla"", Humongous, who led the pack with his choke-hold and ""worse then Ahnold"" elocution.  The inventiveness and damn-straight honesty of the characters and dialogue (of Bellflower) were revivifying most of the time in the ""best"" way, with only the occasional freshman mistake to intrude.  The markedly stylized cinematography was the other half (along with the soundtrack) to keep the audience's interest peaked throughout, and was the reason that my initial reaction was so markedly demonstrative and jettisoned me across the room to the computer to immediately buy the Blu-Ray.  So to the cast, crew, and Mr. Glodell, Kudos! ...for getting this prematurely wizening hipster off his a%$- Holy carbuncle!

4505307,3,B004Z29WD0,"For a movie shot on pocket change and gas money, ""Bellflower"" succeeds brilliantly.  The filmmakers utilize low-budget locations in a way that makes sense for the movie, and get a great look with digital shooting.  IMDB claims the director made the cameras himself; I can believe it, because the cinematography is creative, unusual and high-quality.  The actors, especially in the first act, come across very naturally and actually act like real human beings.

One thing that ""Bellflower"" captures very well is the downside of that ""free-spirited"" girl who captures the imagination and heart of the introverted guy.  She's great, and fun, but a girl who loves to do whatever comes into her head at any given time will sooner than later move on to someone or something more interesting.  However, that's where this movie starts to break down.  It starts off energetic and fun, loses its way in the second act, and doesn't start to come on strong again until the end of the second act.  The characters start to break character, and continuity breaks down, before you start to have an idea as to why.  I knock off two stars primarily for these reasons.

The 30-minute ""making of"" featurette is almost better than the movie itself.  It gives you a raw, unvarnished look at what it takes to break into the movie business. The writer/director lives in a garage in conditions barely better than a homeless man.  The team scrounged semi-abandoned office space as a production headquarters that they at times lived in; they barely had money for food; and, after the SXSW debut of the film, they didn't have enough money to get home but for an unsolicited $1000 cash from P Diddy.  What they had was the burning desire to make a movie, and because they were dirt poor and broke they had no option but to succeed.  Young people who dream of hitting it big in Hollywood need to watch this.

SPOILER-FREE VERSION OF MY REVIEW: This is not an action/adventure movie. The trailer mislead you into thinking so. Virtually all the action in this movie happens in the trailer. This movie is about two loser/slackers and their dream to build a flamethrower and the ultimate Mad Max-inspired muscle car. Woodrow, one of the slackers, falls in love with Milly. They both seem to like each other. But something tears them apart. And Woodrow must contain the rage inside him that threatens to destroy his own life as well as the lives of his loved ones.

I liked it. I can relate to the viewpoint of a young, shiftless male going through heartbreak. Those who didn't like it had gripes with the acting; the shaky-cam; the dialogue: there's a lot of ""sweet"", ""awesome"", ""totally awesome"", ""dude"", etc. peppered throughout the dialogue; the slow-pacing; the jumbled storytelling; the ending; and a few other things.

Like I said, I can relate to it so I like it. But here's my recommendation. Rent it before buying it. So many people have been disappointed with this flick. I wasn't one of them. But judging from the reviews here and on imdb.com, the disapppointment was pretty huge.

SPOILERS

This spoiler-filled part of my review is for those of you who would rather see spoilers than taking the precaution of being one of those reviewers who said, ""I can't believe I wasted 103 minutes of my life watching this movie.""

Woodrow and Aiden are shiftless slackers from Wisconsin who movied to Southern California for sun, sand, babes, and booze. Their goal is to build a cool flamethrower and the ultimate Mad-Max inspired muscle car. One night, at a local bar, Woodrow enters a cricket eating contest, where he is soundly beaten by a chick named Milly. Woodrow ends up scoring a date with her the for the next day. On that first date they drive from California to Texas. Why? Because she asked Woodrow to take her to the most disgusting restaurant he can think of.

All this is surprising. Milly is carefree, weird, unpredictable, cool, and extremely friendly. She laughs at his jokes, gives free and easy sex, and is interested in him as a lover. But months later, Woodrow's desperate wussiness begins to smother her. In the trailer, Milly says, ""You don't want me to be your girlfriend. Because I'll hurt you."" That's exactly what happens. Woodrow comes home one day to find Milly is screwing some other dude...in his house...on his bed. Woodrow punches the dude twice, but the dude isn't fazed. Milly tries to explain that she's sort of sorry but Woodrow ends up running off in his motorcycle. He doesn't get far because some car smashes him and trashes his bike.

After getting out of the hospital, Woodrow and Aiden decide to finish making the car they call ""the Medusa"". But Woodrow is distracted. He ends up sleeping with Courtney, Milly's best friend and a chick who is Aiden's girlfriend...sort of. Courtney loves him. But he can't get over Milly. He goes to her house and burns her things on her front lawn. The guy who ended up screwing Milly gets killed by Aiden. Aiden runs away. Woodrow brutalizes Milly and Courtney kills herself. Afterward, Aiden ends up on the street screaming his head off.

But wait, everything in that last paragraph was a dream. Woodrow gets into an accident and leaves the hospital. But everything that happens afterward is his fantasy. That was the part that pissed a lot of people off. So many reviewers were like, ""What? It was all a dream? Total cop-out!""

I wish it hadn't all been a dream myself. But still, I liked it. There were some gripes though:

1. The dialogue was mainly a bunch of ""dude, sweet, totally, totally awesome,"" kinda stuff. Most of the dialogue was conversational. It wasn't deep or anything.

2. The acting was amateurish. When the actors had to display real emotions like anger or fear, they were pretty bad. Many times they looked like they wanted to laugh, as if they were saying, ""Dude, I can't believe I'm in a movie.""

3. The lenses were dirty. During takes, filmmakers will generally clean their lenses to get the dust, hairs, and grimes off the lenses. Much of the time the director kept it there on purpose, causing some haters of this flick to label him an idiot.

4. The shaky-cam was annoying.

5. The rape scene disturbed some despite the fact that it was only 10 seconds. But it wasn't rape for exploitation. It was showing true emotions of a heartbroken man.

There is other stuff I wanna say but I'll stop now. If you wanna know more about this flick then go read more reviews on imdb.com. I only recommend renting this movie. Rent it first. If you like it then buy it afterward.",1341792000,,4869,4.663943990665111

4505310,4,B004Z29WD0,"<strong>Bellflower</strong> (Evan Glodell, 2011)

I grant you, I have not yet seen many films made in 2011 (nine, according to my spreadsheet) and most of those have ranged from the aggressively mediocre to the outrageously awful (if you value your sanity, avoid <em>2012: Zombie Apocalypse</em> at all costs), and so I probably have no business opining on the best, worst, or anything else of 2011. And yet I will still tell you: when the dust settles, say five years from now when I have fifty or sixty movies made in 2011 under my belt, <em>Bellflower</em>, if it is not still perched atop my Best of 2011 list, is pretty much guarantted to still be somewhere in the top three. It's that good. Which is not to say it doesn't have its flaws, but it's still that good.

Plot: two slackers, Woodrow (director Glodell in his first feature appearance) and Aiden (Tyler Dawson, also in his first feature appearance), are obsessed with <em>The Road Warrior</em>, spending their days building flamethrowers and drawing concept art for their version of Medusa, Mel Gibson's car in the film. Life is going along just peachy unil Woodrow meets Milly (Jessie Wiseman in her first screen appearance), an outgoing, vivacious woman who he finds himself in a relationship with very quickly. This is the beginning of the strain on Woodrow and Aiden's friendship; the story, which develops an episodic feel later on, details the way the relationships between Woodrow, Aiden, and Milly's circle of friends change as the events that start from Woodrow and Milly's impulsive decision to drive to Texas on their first date escalate.

First off: this fim was criminally mismarketed as a sci-fi feature. One could conceivably call it fantasy, if you turn your head and squint right, but what it really is is a romantic drama with a kind of gritty realism that stems from Glodell's being realistic about his minuscule budget and embracing it in order to make his film look as polished and professional as possible. Second: these characters exist. That is the film's strongest point; you can look at at least one of these characters and say ""I know that person"" without any of the leaps or elisions necessary with most films given the two-dimensionality of most Hollywood characters (and the emotional shortcuts used to build them, as I've detailed in numerous previous reviews). The soundtrack is perfect, the cinematography is almost perfect (Glodell and Dawson hand-built the cameras used in the making of the movie, so had complete control over the film's look, and they knew what they were doing), Glodell's script is fantastic for about eighty of the movie's one hundred seven minutes.

Then comes the movie's biggest downfall: there's a series of what may or may not be fantasy or dream sequences, in some cases possibly nestled inside one another. It's a very, very difficult technique to pull off, and I'm not sure I've ever seen it successfully done in a movie; the closest media analogue I can come to what I think Glodell was trying to do in the last half-hour of this film is Catherynne Valente's novel <em>In the Night Garden</em>, with its stories-inside-stories-inside-stories structure. Glodell doesn't quite have enough of a handle on it, though it's impossible to say whether it's his inexperience as a filmmaker, his script, continuity issues, or any number of other factors contributed to the problems here. On the up side, it does keep people talking about the film, because they're wondering what the hell was going on there. On the downside, they're still talking about it, in the main, because they hated the last half-hour so much. I didn't; it seemed to me that if you paid enough attention you could work out which parts were Woodrow's revenge fantasies/wishes for things to go back to the way they were at the beginning of the story (that is, after all, the meaning of the opening scene, which gives us a reverse montage of key scenes from the movie) and which parts really happened--if any of them did. But you do have to pay attention, kind of in the same way you do in the final montage of <em>Poetry</em>. And if you had told me before I watched <em>Bellflower</em>, when I thought pretty much the same as everyone else about it, that I would be comparing it to <em>Poetry</em> with a straight face in my review, I'd have probably laughed at you... but at heart, the two of them are very much of a piece.

In short, a micro-budget film that doesn't come off feeling like a microbudget film. I expect great things from a lot of folks involved in this movie (especially Jessie Wiseman, whose performance is fearless, brazen, and occasionally heartbreaking). A lot of people ended up hating it because they thought they were getting something they didn't. Don't be that guy.

The dialogue and acting are true to the characters, and the strong buddy element between Woodrow and Aiden was a strong hook that emotionally dealt me into the story.

I'm also a huge fan of David Lynch, and which I wouldn't characterize this film as Lynchian, it definitely had the disorienting flavor of a Lynch movie. The cinematography was especially tasty.

We are in the middle of a war, between our civilized selves and the anarchy that cries out inside us, that wants to be Kali the Destroyer (or in this case, Humungous). Glodell holds the hidden secret of our hearts. We mash this secret down and deny its existence until the pressure becomes intolerable, and we feel so alone in the world, in that place. But surely if there is any single point to this film, it's to show us this secret is one we all share. Glodell holds out his hands and lets us look inside ourselves, to reach what we're struggling all the time to catch out of the corner of our eye. Our better selves? Maybe - but surely not the point at all. Our true selves? Definitely.

The story follows two friends who mod old cars, Mad Max style, and build flamethrowers, until one of them falls in love with a girl and they all embark on a dark, nihilistic journey together. A couple things to note here: Glodell, a bit of gearhead himself, not only built and modified the cars featured in the film, he also crafted the flamethrower and pieced together the camera used to film the movie out of vintage camera parts and Russian lenses. Filmed on a tiny budget, Bellflower is one of those very independent films that comes around every once in a while and impresses me with its ambition and audacity.

So, when I see some people want so badly to make a film that they go so far as to have each participant perform multiple tasks each (e.g. be an actor, editor, producer, coffeemaker) then whom am I to be the ogre and say, ""Sorry, but ...""
OK, the ""but' part is that although the storyline had a bit of potential, ""but"" had they taken the time to write and rewrite and think and rethink it all through such that they came out with not only a coherent creative product but something that captured the viewers' attention. That's the point - right! Otherwise it isn't an art form without the viewer.

And the final tally is! One vote for a hodgepodge of drinking, partying, brief dumb sex sorta, guys hanging with their car mods and similar boy toys with a bunch of stuff thrown in that made no sense. Two votes for I'm not an ogre and you could see that they tried. If a bit of objectivity is needed in this vote then I offer my inverse ratio theorem - movies are as good as the inverse ratio of the number of songs and credits ""special thanks"". So 26 songs and 62 ""special thanks"" equates to about a two rating. By the way, those numbers are midrange. I've seen much higher numbers.",1323388800,2,1408,4.370229007633588
4505321,1,B004Z29WD0,"I wanted to like this movie.  The synopsis on the box makes it sound kind of like an out-of-control mix of post-apocalyptic elements (sort of) and David Lynch.  However, I found the movie to be incredibly disappointing.  It turns out it is just a movie about a relationship between two twenty-something hipsters.  The relationship aspect of the film plays out like melodrama involving betrayal and infidelity.  So many movies that have come before it have broadcasted the plot points of this film a thousand times over.  There are no surprises.  The relationship begins, it plays out, aaaannnnd...done.  Having a cool apocalypse car and a flamethrower thrown into the mix do very little to add color to this predictable story.  In fairness, the acting is pretty convincing and the dialogue is decent.  It's just the predictability of the story and the broken promises of ""disturbing violence"" and such that really sink it.  I guess if you're clued in on the plot before you watch it, you may appreciate it more.  I, for one, feel that the movie's packaging completely misrepresented it.  Hats off, though, to Evan Godell, a clearly innovative and ambitious young filmmaker (he helped created the gadgets in the movie, built the cameras to shoot it - at least that's what I heard - and takes a lead role).  Hopefully, he'll realize that good writing and acting can't overcome the disappointment of a very unoriginal story.",1322784000,3,1421,4.940928270042194
