4496562,5,B004XML3KC,"This short segement from 60 Minutes, about 20 minutes in length, is a rare glimpse into the life of the Monks of Mt Athos, the Heart of Eastern Orthodox monasticism and prayer. With breathtaking camera shots and slow editing, the pacing of the segment reflects the tempo of the monastic life. Interviews with various monastics recount how and why they chose this uncommon way of life, which is a service of love not only to God and their fellow monks, but for the whole world on account of the power of their prayers. It is really well-done and I recommend it heartily.

There are many many more. Of course, what unites all Orthodox is our bond in Christ as His Body, and this is solidified in our liturgical life. So if you are really interested in Orthodoxy, begin to attend our liturgies and talk to some folks who are seeking to live out the gospel in an Eastern tune. There's nothing like it!
Enjoy!",1314403200,10,1867,7.486363636363636
4496563,5,B004XML3KC,What a wonderful glimpse into a place so remote from the rest of the world.  I'm really glad that 60 minutes was persistent in trying to get access.,1310256000,4,148,4.285714285714286
4496564,5,B004XML3KC,"My father called me long distance, telling me  about what would be on the 60 minutes TV show.  As I was watching the show, I thought--""I should be recording this"".  And of course, I didn't!!!  I was so focused and frozen watching and listening to this great show.  Next best thing was to order it as soon as I could.  I felt the price was very fair & it arrived within a few days to my door!.  This is a must-have in video/DVD library. I only wish it would have come with a plane ticket & passport!",1308614400,19,498,4.072164948453608

After reading a lot about the Byzantine Empire, which initially supported the monasteries on Mount Athos, I had bought one of the several books on the suject, which I found to be unsatisfactory because of its black and white photographs. What this program makes clear is what a beautiful place Mount Athos is, both in terms of its natural surrounding and the stunning architecture.

While the interviews with the monks are short (the entire program only lasts 25 minutes), I found them to be quite interesting, unlike those in Mysteries of the Jesus Prayer.

All in all, an interesting and enjoyable program.",1306886400,23,902,6.150793650793651
4496566,5,B004XML3KC,"I was extremely fortunate to visit Mt. Athos in 1974. Without a doubt, the most surreal experience of my life. I am not Greek Orthodox, and obtained a visa from the Greek Consulate in Chicago that I then had to take to the Greek Government in Athens. It involved flying to Thessaloniki, Greece, taking a 3 hour school bus ride, surrendering my passport, boarding a ferry for an hour trip down the Peninsula. Then a harrowing school bus ride up to the main exit. I applied as a student of Byzantine Architecture, and, as a foreigner, was separated from the three young Greek men I met who spoke English. I slept in a cell for non-Greeks. There are no female anythings on the site; so no milk, eggs; moldy cheese and bread and tomatoes. You must walk on dirt paths from one monetary to another. My Greek did me no good; the monks spoke Church Greek. Luckily, my young friends translated for me!

Since I was there, they have added some electricity. Photography was allowed, but not of the monks, and the Churches were illuminated only by oil and candles. I felt as if I was literally on the moon, cut off from civilization as I was. I was well treated and it probably ranks as the most exotic place on the planet.

BUY this DVD! You will never see anything like it.",1303776000,48,1263,4.416309012875536

A great documentary with so much information and wonderfully short be deep impacting dialogue with the Monks that leaves the viewer craving more.

8447207,5,B004XML3KC,"This little documentary provides a good introduction to ancient Christianity as preserved and practiced by the Orthodox Church. Here the viewer gets a sneak peak into Christian practice and tradition extenting back to the time of the Apostles. This is Christianity that has never been involved in crusades, inquisitions, reforming fragmentation and scandal such is the norm in Western Christianity (what most people call the Roman Catholic Church and all of it's Protestant branches). If you're interested in learning more, perhaps try Mountain of Silence by Kyriacos Markides, Coming Home by Peter Gilquist, or Baptist to Byzantium by James Early.",1378080000,,648,5.49
8447208,5,B004XML3KC,Most monasteries on Mt. Athos do not allow for filming or pictures. I was pleased that one monastery gave a glimpse of a service. All monasteries on Mt. Athos are for men only. This is because the Theotokos (mother of God or Virgin Mary) visited the mountain and from then on no women were/are allowed. The 60 minute documentary allowed me a glimpse of what it is like on the Holy Mountain. I hope 60 minutes is allowed another visit.,1357776000,2,434,4.4375

8447212,5,B004XML3KC,"This beautiful video allowed me to relive my experiences in Mt. Athos.  After twelve trips made in twelve consecutive years I was able to see just a fraction of what makes Mt Athos (The Holy Mountain, Agion Oros)a unique microcosm within our planet with its Byzantine history and beauty that surpasses our imagination.  60 Minutes took me back to relive my experiences that I could feel my foot stepping on the same ground and touching the spots the images were depicting.  The highlight of this short film was to see familiar faces, people I know, and who embarked me through my current path and spiritual journey. This film is a great introduction to such wonderful place, unfortunately only accessible to a few, to experience and learn that in the midst of our tumultuous earth there is a unique oasis, mysterious though, extremely beautiful and full of prayer and hope.",1327622400,10,873,4.845637583892618
8447213,5,B004XML3KC,"""They finally got it right"", I heard several say, Orthodox friends who'd been there and then seen this 60 Minutes look at Mt. Athos.  CBS was refused entry to these monastic communities or to do this story for almost 30 years.  The monks have changed their minds and opened up some.  Now we have this reverent overview of the Holy Mountain, its impact through the last 1,000 years and today.

I've since booked my trip to this place for 2013 and look forward to walking the dirt roads between monasteries here.  I will venerate the relics of Father Porphyrios and others who have shown us the light from this mountain.  I recommend this DVD.  Although it is available online, having a DVD to pop in the player for friends would be nice.  This is a warm story on what it is like to make an entire simple life of simply, talking to God, living in community with others, staying...near.",1323561600,11,883,4.509433962264151
