8323104,1,B001N3R8T4,"This DVD did not work when I tried to play it in my Blu-Ray player. I put the disc in to the player immediately after opening it. The disc played the first 5 minuets then began to skip and pause randomly. I am not happy at all. The video claims to be shipwrecks of the Great Lakes, but the first 5 minuets that I was able to watch was no more than B-Roll of Mackinac Island. I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my dad. On Chirstmas day, rather than being able to enjoy a Blu-Ray about shipwrecks I had to deal with a disc that did not work. NOT HAPPY! Seller should contact me to correct the problem.",1419811200,,605,4.05
