455918,3,6302276268,"What if Sesame Street made a 'best of' video and didn't invite the stars to the party?
Poor Ernie and Bert don't even get the chance to introduce their favourite bits in this too short, half-hour video. Instead, the viewer gets stuck with Big Bird and Gina. Whatever goodwill is generated during Ernie and Bert is swept away with the useless banter between our hosts.
While we get to see Bert playing checkers with a pigeon, where's Ernie singing Rubber Ducky? That classic bit should have been a no-brainer for this compilation.
Two great talents get the short-thrift from their superiors on this one. That's too bad.",1022544000,8,618,4.785046728971962
455919,5,6302276268,"My 5 year old watched this video over and over and over (you get the point) when she was a toddler.  Now my twin 1 year olds have begun watching it.  They LOVE it.  Ernie and Bert are their favorite Sesame Street characters and the short skits and fun songs keep them glued to the TV for the whole 25 minutes.  My 5 year old was also scared of the ""Egypt"" section, but not until she was about 4.  Up until then she loved it.",973987200,4,424,3.9411764705882355
455920,4,6302276268,"While there are way too many great Ernie and Bert segments from the series for one 30-minute tape, this is not a bad collection. Within this tape, you will find the classic ""Bert Plays Checkers with His Pigeon"", ""Bert and Ernie in Egypt"", ""The National Association of W Lovers"", and a few more as well! Fun for the whole family!  END",894844800,,333,4.459016393442623

7824811,4,6302276268,"These are some fantastic shorts from my faves Bert and Ernie, but I really feel that, (1) you should buy them on DVD and (2) the video is just wayy too short.  They have hours and hours of footage, couldn't they add some more in?  But you still have to love Ernie and Bert.  Just go buy it on DVD.",1286841600,,297,3.9166666666666665

7824814,5,6302276268,"I have been an Ernie and Bert fan since I was a kid, and this video is now so much fun to watch with my own baby, or the children I babysit.  There are some classics in here: The trip to Egypt, the night of camping out, the trip to the movies where Ernie has to solve the problem of a lady who sat in front of him with a huge hat, etc.  Then there is the wonderful lullaby, ""If I Could Visit the Moon.""  It's too bad they didn't make this a DVD, and it's too bad there aren't more of Ernie and Bert, because I for one am sick of Elmo!!!  Anyway, for those of you who are ""Old School"" Sesame Street, you will love this.  It is Jim Henson at his brilliant best.",1168819200,3,659,3.8161764705882355

Not even ""Rubber Duckie"" or ""Doin' The Pigeon"". But still, if you want some of the most hilarious muppet moments ever, buy this video!",1036368000,,281,4.64
