8436430,4,B004N6F3TK,"I saw this film at SIFF 2010...a rather entertaining and, as it progresses, surprisingly absorbing narrative that suddenly transforms from a sex-infused (male/male, one VERY sexy girl) road trip into a deeper (and darker) psychological mystery.

As a bonus, Ms. Seidoux is utterly alluring and seductive, in general, and the opening (hard rock) sequence features several minutes of a topless Lea doing a very provocative/erotic dance (for the older male character, Sam).

If you are uncomfortable with homoerotic imagery, or French films in general, this movie is not for you.",1387843200,,576,5.388888888888889
