369596,5,6301788486,"I think this was by far the best adaptation ever made.  True to the text with stellar performances by the entire cast.  In our opinion this is the best performance ever done by Anthony Hopkins, though one of the least recognized.  Our VHS version has worn out because it was  a family traditon to watch it together every Christmas.  I don't know why this was never put out on DVD.",1098403200,26,380,4.371428571428571
369597,2,6301788486,charles dickens wrote this so called classic.its long boring and stupid! theres this kid who cuts a escaped prisoners shackles off and many years later he repays the favor.and theres an entire unrelated story in the middle.you could let your kids watch it if they need to go to sleep.theres many versions.they all suck.old people seem to like it.no chicks! its consistent with the book.the important message is be nice to people and theyll repay.stuff doesnt work like that in real life though.this movie is no good.,1097625600,,516,4.942528735632184
369598,5,6301788486,This is by far the best version of Great Expectations that I have seen. I do not know why Disney does not have this available for purchase. It is the most faithful to the novel and has great performances.,953424000,23,204,4.256410256410256
369599,5,6301788486,"I thought this was the best version of the book that I have ever seen on the screen.  The acting, setting, costumes and script were fabulous and very true to the original.  As a teacher I find this video absolutely  invaluable for students; it helps them to correctly and clealry visualize  the time period.",936748800,10,307,4.62962962962963
369600,5,6301788486,"I was one of the lucky ones to purchase this last summer.  The one my parents taped off TV back in summer 1989 was pretty shabby.  Now that I'm on my own, I can surely appreciate the wonderful acting and detailed  screenwriting from this fabulous Dicken's novel.  Great job by Kevin  Connor, John Goldsmith, Anthony Calf, Anthony Hopkins, John Rhys-Davis,  Adam Blackwood, Jean Simmons.",925430400,4,386,4.953125
369601,5,6301788486,Definitely one of Disney's Classics. I can't believe it's not available. I have been looking for this movie for years. I think it's time to release it -------- PLEASE !!,918172800,2,169,4.666666666666667
369681,5,6301788486,just Love this version of Great Exspectations with Anthony Hopkins and John Rhys-Davies BRAVOOOOOOO wish it was on DVD tho :) worth watching again and again :),1323648000,2,159,4.925925925925926
369682,5,6301788486,"This is a Disney film, I watched with my kids on the Disney channel twenty years ago . I've been looking for it ever since. Found It !! Thank  you Amazon.
And still love it.
A great mystery, Charles Dickens would be proud.",1299110400,,222,4.162790697674419
369683,5,6301788486,"I began Disney's version of Dickens' tale with reservations -- even if it fleshed out the story, could it surpass Lean's version?
At first I didn't think so. Pip's clothing, for instance, looks coarser in Lean's, and the fact he wore them to bed is probably accurate for the time and their economic condition. Then the spareness of the Gargery household is probably accurate for a blacksmith's income.
But on the other hand, John Mills was too old to play the adult, Pip. And the actress who played the adult Estella wasn't very satisfactory. Then there's the complete departure of the ending from that of the book.
I could go on but I'll end by saying I've been won by Disney's version because it contains so much more of Dickens' story. In fact, I wonder if it's possible to do justice to a Dickens' book in the usual 1 1/2 - 2 hour movie. I just wish someone would clean up the tape a bit and digitize it.
But, of course, one can have both and enjoy them both for different reasons. (One can only dream that Lean had had the money to do the entire story his way.)
Addendum: I've just bought this German DVD of Disney's version and the quality is excellent. But, I also had to locate instructions online for converting my DVD player to an all-region player. (It's legal for the owner to do this and it doesn't void the player's warranty; a computer repair shop probably can do it for a nominal sum).
Thank heaven a German company had the wisdom to see the value of digitizing this film. Where Disney apparently found sufficient funds to support this English-made production, they didn't see sufficient sales to justify converting it to DVD. For us lovers of this Dickens' story, I'm very thankful a German company did.",1295654400,2,1720,4.551612903225807
369684,5,6301788486,This is our family's favorite Dickens movie adaptation. When is it going to released as a DVD? Make it blu-ray while you're at it.,1294185600,,130,4.458333333333333
369685,5,6301788486,Well made.  It's as close to the book as any version will get.  Wish it came in DVD format though.,1288483200,,98,3.85
369686,3,6301788486,"I absolutely love this movie, it is undoubtedly the best adaptation of the book.  My lowered score is entirely based on my buying experience.  It was advertised (in bold upper-case letters) that this was a ""brand new, factory sealed"" video.  On first inspection, it was obvious that it had been used, the seal broken, the labels a bit worn.  Then, while viewing, the second of the three videos buzzed horribly throughout.  I've wanted this movie for a long time and was very disappointed, not so much at the movies, but I hated being lied to.
  I have no idea why Disney hasn't released this on DVD, but if I'm paying for a used product, don't lose my business buy lying to me when just saying ""used in good condition"" would have been fine.  If you have the opportunity to watch a good copy of this movie, do it!  It is WELL worth it, and you'll not find it's equal.  Disney, get this out on DVD!!!",1283126400,3,898,4.387878787878788
369687,5,6301788486,"Excellent film.  Where is the DVD?  This is an excellent film based on Dickens' classic.  I agree with all the previous, positive reviews herein.  I only wish with enough attention the powers at be will see to make a DVD as soon as possible.  BTW - Anthony Hopkins delivers a rich and asthetically beautiful performance as Magwitch, yet this work is not listed with his other works.  Please create a DVD copy before this treasure is lost.",1259884800,,438,4.623376623376624
369688,5,6301788486,When will a DVD be released?  The VHS version is antiquated and an inconvenience to use.  It's hard to believe that a mini-series that was so critically acclaimed isn't available on DVD.  Help.,1244246400,,193,4.787878787878788
369689,1,6301788486,"This is the best version of Great Expectations in film, I gave it a star because it's in VHS. I have no idea why they didn't come out on DVD.

Well...if any of you are waiting for DVD or planning to buy this VHS, think again. This film actually came out in DVD at UK so look somewhere else.",1207267200,2,290,3.9152542372881354
369690,5,6301788486,"This is by far the best overall version of ""Great Expectations"" and when I say that I mean to take nothing away from the great David Lean film.  I had taped this when it was originally broadcast on the Disney channel, but made the mistake of loaning it to my niece when she was studying the book in school.  She's a great kid, but I never saw the tapes again.

Hopefully one day Disney will issue this on dvd without screwing it up.  I should think even if there was no other reason to see it there would be some interest in seeing the pre-Hannibal Lechter Anthony Hopkins threatening to eat someones liver.",1162339200,5,607,4.345132743362832
7815958,5,6301788486,"Wonderfully well acted by some great names, a complete version of the Dicken's novel done with the Brits as a TV mini-series.  While not wide screen, I highly recommend this version.  A bit over 300 min.",1456790400,2,203,4.611111111111111

7815961,5,6301788486,"I have taught GE for decades at the 9th and AP 12 levels, and this is the truest and most faithful version. I want Disney to put it out on DVD. Such a shame that it is not more widely available.",1418601600,4,194,3.7560975609756095

My absolute favorite rendition done on film...

7815966,5,6301788486,"This is by far the the most true to novel adaptation for Great Expectations. The only possible improvement is that there could be more dynamics between Pip and Estella.

Please Please Please release the DVD version.",1349827200,2,215,4.972222222222222
7815967,5,6301788486,"I too remember watching this mini series when it was first released and being impressed with how closely it followed the Dickens book. I wish they would release this on DVD. If only for the performance watching Jean Simmons play Miss Havisham, after previously playing Estella in the David lean film of 1946..Disney please release this. Give us something decent to watch aside form all the mindless drivel that cloggs Television these days.",1337904000,2,440,5.041095890410959
