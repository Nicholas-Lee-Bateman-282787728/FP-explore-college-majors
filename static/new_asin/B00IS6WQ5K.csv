8644887,2,B00IS6WQ5K,"Did the Lizard Man step off the set of Power Rangers or out of a Halloween costume store? I can't decide. Anyhow, the suit is just as bad as the acting. I love schlock like this, but kinda got bored with it. Be sure to watch the music video at the end to see our menacing creature dancing with bikini clad chicks at a pool party, that itself deserves one star.",1457827200,,360,4.084507042253521
8644888,1,B00IS6WQ5K,"This film is based on the South Carolina lizard man which everyone I know in South Carolina considers a hoax, as shown in the film. Bill Buxley (Michael Gaglio) saw the creature as a child and now as a rich adult is determined to capture the rubber headed creature who strikes with CG blood splatter.

On the plus side, we see the creature early and often.
On the minus side, we see the creature early and often.

It looks like a ""Creature from the Black Lagoon"" costume. The acting. dialogue, and story line was bad and low budget.

Now I will say that the girl on the cover is in the film and played by porn star Brittany Blaze. However, they spent so much money on the monster costume, they didn't have enough left over to have her remove her top. Instead we have a topless scene with Amy Jokinen (The Bachelor) and Yelena Savranskaya.

Guide: F-bomb and nudity. No sex.",1430352000,3,873,4.403726708074534

8644890,4,B00IS6WQ5K,"This lower budget film is not bad!  The suspect that the monster suit would not fool anyone, except for perhaps during the darkest and/or foggiest of nights, but; it still fit the roll!  The movie shares elements with classic films such as Creature from the Black Lagoon and King Kong.  I enjoyed it, and I am pleased with my decision to purchase it.  If they make a sequel, I will buy a copy!",1406937600,4,393,4.342465753424658

Synopsis: A teenager escapes an encounter with a lizard man and aspires to become a billionaire and hire mercenaries to capture one and display it to the world.

In many respects this is a true story, as the plot is generally based upon the actual Lizard Man of Scape Ore Swamp sightings in Lee County, South Carolina. Additional plot devices come straight from King Kong (33) and the monster bears a striking similarity to the Creature From The Black Lagoon (54).

The Carl Denham character is split into the two distinct roles of Bill Hansen as the driving force and backer of the expedition, and unscrupulous TV personality Professor Reeves (Michael Harding) as the zealous promoter. There is no Fay Wray love interest, but we do get a John Driscoll type hero nonetheless, Mark Turnball (James Lewis) was the leader and co-survivor of the mercenary team that captured the creature. He and the appalled doctor tasked with examination of the creature each work independently to prevent additional slaughters of innocents by the creature.

This is an exciting throwback to classic fifties sci-fi monster movies with many themes and characters represented. Any vintage monster movie fan knows that they were mostly low-budget with talky exposition and usually with extraneous and unlikely romances thrown in for padding. Lizardman mostly steers clear of these pitfalls with numerous action and attack scenes in between the bickering and in-fighting between the principle characters.

The monster suit is very well realized and a highlight of the production. The cast are very good in their performances as well. Complexity of both cinematography and script is quite impressive. Most problematical are budget induced shortcomings in the minimal gore effects. Most injuries take place off camera or are enhanced with CGI blood effects applied on the cheap with no regard to continuity. Thus a character can look severely injured but be barely bruised in the next scene.

The DVD:

Camp Motion Pictures always provides a class presentation of their features and Lizardman is no exception. It looks great in anamorphic widescreen, though no subtitles or closed-captions are provided. After the close of the movie proper a rap Lizardman music video appears prior to the credits. A trailer for it and other releases are the only extras.

This is a very entertaining blend of modern monster sightings with the grand tradition of schlock men-in-rubber-suit monster movies. And as Gill-Man knockoffs go, its more ambitious than virtually any of its predecessors; Horror Of Party Beach, Slithis, Beach Girls and the Monster, Monster from the Oceans Floor, Humanoids from the Deep, Revenge of the Creature, or The Creature Walks Among Us.",1400889600,10,3305,5.274285714285714
