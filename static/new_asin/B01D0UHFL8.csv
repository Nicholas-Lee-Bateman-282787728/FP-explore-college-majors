8754600,5,B01D0UHFL8,"This movie is great on a number of levels.  It briefly tells some history from different cultures.  It shows a little about how governments can resist change.  Then demonstrates how having enough passion can overcome resistance.  That passion in this movie is through great music.
These musicians probably risked their lives doing what they loved & focused on common ground rather than the differences toward peace.

  David Broza is very genuine.  The only negative review had to do with someone possibly ordering the wrong product. Touching story",1503014400,,548,5.218390804597701

8754602,4,B01D0UHFL8,"This 2014 film (84 minutes) is just being released on home video by Film Movement. (I was provided with an advance screener. The film (with two co-directors ) documents Israeli singer songwriter David Brozas eight day project  in 2013 to make an album recorded in both sides of the border in Jerusalem (the Israeli said and the Palestinian side) with musicians of both sects. He even brought over Austin-based Americana Singer Steve Earle to produce some of the tracks and play on them. The first song they recorded was Earles hit song Jerusalem. They bring in a young Palestinian rapper who tells how music saved his life and this part will tug at your heart. Some songs are in Arabic and some are in Hebrew but most are in English, including a version of Nick Lowes hit Whats so funny about peace, love and understanding? sung by a chorus of Palestinian kids.
Not all the song performances are complete, but there is plenty of music here. There are four deleted scenes (about 13 minutes total) as bonuses on the DVD  including three complete songs with Broza and Earle.

Be aware that there are a few expletives (the film is not rated) but no violence or nudity.

While this might be considered a long infomercial for the CD (which I haven't heard)  I found the film life-affirming. And, as a big Steve Earle fan, it was interesting to see him in a different environment.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.
