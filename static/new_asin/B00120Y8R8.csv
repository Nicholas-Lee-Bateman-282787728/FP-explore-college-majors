The special effects are decent maybe half the time at best if at all. The English dubbing is horrible, they use the same actor and actress in multiple roles and both don't seem to understand how to emote. They're speaking never matches the emotions of the characters, so it really isn't helping the movie. It would probably be alot better in the original language. The one good point about this movie is that it's an original concept, and with some work and perhaps a bigger budgeted remake, it could be a downright fantastic film.",1218240000,3,684,4.569105691056911
