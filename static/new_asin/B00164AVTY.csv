8260740,3,B00164AVTY,"This is a well produced DVD.  However, because it's intended to teach English riding, I won't be using it.  We have western tack and were hoping for a western riding lesson or two from this DVD.

The basic horse care information is good.

If you are looking for an English riding primer, I recommend you get this DVD.  Look elsewhere for western riding though.",1225584000,22,360,4.5625
