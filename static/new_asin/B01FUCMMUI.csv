8761532,5,B01FUCMMUI,This is a lovely British comedy dealing with the legal profession. The title reflects a lawyer joke: What's the difference between a lawyer and a rat? There are some things rats won't do. It really is too bad it isn't available in the U.S. Would be lovely if Amazon could put it on PRIME for a while. I'd love to see it again.,1533772800,,326,4.190476190476191
8761533,5,B01FUCMMUI,"A delightful romantic comedy, on the farcical side but intelligent. Excellent direction, acting, production values, and music. I can't understand why it's not available on Region 1 DVD.",1512086400,,185,5.642857142857143
