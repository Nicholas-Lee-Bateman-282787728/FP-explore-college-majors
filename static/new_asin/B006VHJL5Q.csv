On the lighter side, the scenery is interesting and the costumes are pretty.  The ladies seem to know martial arts, though they do have that fly-through-the-air thing going on even though they don't do it very well.",1354060800,9,345,4.60655737704918

5020579,4,B006VHJL5Q,"This is a very good remake of the Original made back during the dominant run Shaw Brothers had in the Martials Film making genre. This movie was produced by Jackie Chan and I must say that this is a epic big production, with no shortage of action sequences. It got to be a little long on the drama to the build up but over all a good movie. The main weapon of choice in this film is the sabre and the choreagraph is well done.",1350950400,18,426,4.023529411764706
5020580,5,B006VHJL5Q,"Another big-budget-look film with producer Jackie Chan at the helm, with a terrific look and feel! This time, the women of the nation have to do battle and they are, indeed, more than ready to conquer. Great action and special effects.",1349740800,5,235,4.7560975609756095
5020581,3,B006VHJL5Q,"Until recently, I didn't know China has its own Razzie award (called ""Golden Broom Awards""). Produced by Jackie Chan, ""Legendary Amazons"" is nominated for all four categories of the Chinese Razzie - worst film, worst director, worst actor and worst actress. Well, just in case you are interested in this instant cult classic.

The film's story is based on ""Yang Jia Jiang"" (""Generals of the Yang clan""), which served as a basis of the Shaw Brothers 1972 film ""The 14 Amazons."" In the new version we meet the Yang family, ferociously loyal to the Song Dynasty's emperor. Most male members of the Yang clan are dead after a long time serving for the country.

When Mu Guiying (Cecilia Cheung), wife of General Yang Zongbao (Richie Ren) in charge of the fortress at the borders, learns the death of her beloved husband the armies during the battles against armies of Western Xia, the widows of the Yang clan take up their weapons of choice, and set out for the battlefield for revenge, despite the enemies far outnumbering them, and a corrupt high-rank official trying to interfere.

Not a bad story, is it? But the way the filmmakers ruins it is something amazing. Except for Cheng Pei-pei (""Jade Fox"" of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon""), the film's stars give career-killing performances that are unintentionally funny. The costumes are surely decent, and so is the cinematography shot on location, but cheesy visual effects and over-the-top action stunts (with some silly gadgets) make the film look like a comedy sometimes. I really like the ""red pepper attack"" sequence.

If you are not willing to spend your precious time on something totally ridiculous, just skip this one. If you are an avid moviegoer who can enjoy terrible movies (""Battlefield Earth,"" for instance) for its terribleness, you might find this mess entertaining ... not in the way they filmmakers intended. From a sheer artistic point of view, ""Legendary Amazons"" is just a mess, though I must add to me this is an entertaining mess, which is something not many films can achieve.",1339113600,2,2052,4.939130434782609
5020582,3,B006VHJL5Q,"If you have ever seen a Chinese action film you know they have several things in common. First is that they love bright colors. The martial art fighting special effects include slow motion and sped up sequences which feature indifference to the laws of gravity and physics in general. The English translation sounds like an old Japanese Godzilla film. Fighters are the Chinese version of our old western movies. They can shoot 2 spears from one bow and get two kills. A sword can go through 3 people with one thrust.

When word reaches the Emperor that General Yang has died defending the western border, he commands his son to lead an army to protect the land in what appears to be a suicide mission. The son's fighting sisters join him in order to afford him protection. There is also a dragon staff somehow involved in the tale, and like most Chinese films, there is something I lose in the cultural exchange.

The story does have a plot you can follow. I found the fight scenes to be inane. The ending credits included outtakes. The reason why I watch Chinese pop culture films is for the themes, i.e. what is the message they are sending? In this one the message is China can defeat the overwhelming evil armies of the west. Family is important, but the people of China are also family and of greater importance. Women have their place in society as equals with men (i.e. stop killing girl babies).

No sex or nudity. There was something that sound like the F-word.",1337990400,4,1470,4.581749049429658
5020583,5,B006VHJL5Q,"I have seen this movie at a film theater in Japan, and found out this was a masterpiece in the area of the fighting ladies movies like Underworld and Resident Evil and Tombraiders.

Not only the heroine, but you have a lot of fighting ladies in this picture, an Army of them. @
You can pick your favorite at your own choice.@
 This story is a very very famous in the Chinese world and adopted to a Chinese classic play, I learnd today. I would like to pay respect to the Chinese Classic World.

I believe DVD will soon be available in Japan as well. Unfortunately, however, I saw it in Mandalin version(accordingly in Japan they may sell only Mndalin version) I hope
this Hong Kong version is in Cantonese although I don't understand both of them.

Thinking that I would get the same level of martial arts but with the story lines focus more on the Yang women. What a disappointment Legendary Amazons turned out to be. It reminded me of the bad kung fu movies in the 80's. The plots are all over the places, the dialogs are bad and the battle scenes are a joke. I think I saw a cable in one of the falling scenes.

5020622,3,B006VHJL5Q,"For the most part the production values of the movie are okay with great props and some of the back drops are good, some are not so good, and in parts the green screen backgrounds aren't seemless.  The story is pretty good, but gets muddled sometimes in know who is getting killed or not.  There are so many female Yang fighters it's hard to keep track of who is who.

Most of the women are pretty and there is good action.  If you watch the behind the scenes one can see many of the actresses get injured while filming and the fact they filmed in the desert during winter is amazing they didn't freeze to death.  The crew are wearing down clothing while the actors only get their period clothing.

Based upon the above I give it a three out of five stars and I would buy it again for the $10.00 price I paid for it.",1361750400,3,816,4.165605095541402

5020627,3,B006VHJL5Q,"This was beautifully film but lacking in script, dialogue, flow of story, pacing & editing and some acting direction.  It was more like a stiff movie version of a play that had not completed the translation to film.  The acting in some scenes are so staged for a pose and some scenes just drag for me.  It looked great in some scenes; but it was just ""off"" and I am a very lenient critic when it comes to asian films. I liken it to an old Shaw Bros film only remastered in vivid colors.  Costumes were fabulous and some action scenes were good, but mostly a lot of cut-aways.  I recommend a watch but not to buy.  I probably would not watch this one again.",1356998400,,656,4.208
5020628,1,B006VHJL5Q,"I don't understand why this got any good reviews.  There are multiple reasons that this is a horrible movie.

1) This ""movie"" seems like a TV quality mini-series crunched into a (horribly long) movie.  The graphics, acting, camera style all seem to be TV quality and made for TV.

2) This movie hops all over the place with no real explanations.  It starts with a bit of an explanation of who's who and a little backstory, but even with this the movie is just all over the place.  There are all sorts of characters but you don't really know who they are, how they relate to each other or why you should care for them.

3) Because you don't know who's who or what's going on...why do you care about any of them?  The movie hops from TV one ""end of episode plot point cliffhanger"" to the next with characters dying (or pretending to die) left and right, but who cares, we don't know who they are or why it should be sad.

4) It's hard to believe the movie could get worse as it goes on, but it does.  They create special weapons and tools and, again, how can it get worse???  But the last invention tops the cake...I almost wet my pants at the ridiculousness.

Avoid this movie at all costs.  The only reason I am writing this review is to hopefully spare someone out there the indignity of having to watch this movie.  The reviews are way way off on this one, buy at your own risk.",1356912000,2,1380,4.257692307692308

This film focused less on the story and gave the original movie what it lacked,which was the action. About 70% of the movie is out in the field and Frankie Chan gives you your money's worth.

5020634,1,B006VHJL5Q,"There goes that, what they call Wuxia action scenes, put in an another asian action film.  Ever since I first saw ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"", I've really had a difficult time finding a great asian action or asian war film that doesn't look all so cheesy and ridiculous because of the actors taking flight when they jump or even throwing somebody through the air.

They say this movie is based on a ""true story"" which I was prepared to think that the fighting performances will have to look real and convincing. But no, they went and ruined it.  Everyone's flying in the air like ""fairies"".  Now, I know that it must take alot of work to prepare a split second performance of taking to the air when they are jumping from one hidden platform to another, but even with all that work, the end result still looks so fake and disappointing.  We all know how true, the natural flow of common sense inertia appears to the eyes, so with all that work that they put in their pansy-looking ascending jumps, it's all just another stomach-wretching moment to the skeptical viewer.

The scenery all looks good though. The costumes are really nice, but I've seen prettier asian girls in other films so this film lacked alot of that, as well. And I usually prefer to listen to the natural language (and try to comprehensively follow intently by reading the subtitles), but I wanted to at least try the English dubbing once, and I found that disappointing too.  The English dubbing seems like it was done with a half-hearted effort, and therefore, rather unconvincing. Some of the girls voices sounded like children, half the ages of the actresses on the screen.

Well, anyway, with my expecting so much more than I got (the trailer looked good), I've watched this, (actually I'd rather say I struggled through it), and I'm just gonna give it to one of my young cousins. I guess I've gotta stop depending on watching movie trailers because they seem to be rather deceptive at selling a good movie. I don't think any of that flying around nonsense was in the trailer.

I've noticed that it is gonna be hard for the asian film industry to top ""Red Cliff"" and ""Warriors of The Rainbow: Seediq Bale"", because those are the best asian films I've seen since ""Musa: The Warrior"".",1354406400,2,2261,4.646616541353383
