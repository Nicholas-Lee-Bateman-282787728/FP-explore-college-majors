7289081,5,B00ZR3W4AE,"I have the DVD version of this movie and am looking forward to owning it in Blu-ray.  I enjoy typically enjoy movies for their entertainment value; most of them, however, are ""fluff"".  On rare occasion, I find a film unforgettable.  The Life of David Gale is such a film.

This movie has great actors performing their roles at a high level, and the script is well-crafted.  Let me just say that the ending shocked me when I first saw it and has haunted me ever since.  This is one Blu-ray well worth owning.",1438128000,,507,4.397849462365591

8720676,5,B00ZR3W4AE,"LIFE OF DAVID GALE (2003) is a color film taking place in the present era.  The locations include college classrooms, a house where college students are busy with a wild party, a cluttered office for an anti-capital punishment advocacy group called DEATHWATCH, a dingy motel, rural Texas farmlands, and a prison.  The main issue is that Prof. David Gale had been accused of murdering one of the volunteers for the DeathWatch organization. Prior to this accusation, Prof. Gale's reputation had already been damaged by a false rape accusation.  Although Prof. David Gale had actually ""done it"" with one of his ex-students, played by the abundantly foxy Rhona Mitra, this encounter was actually invited by the ex-student, and there was no courtroom finding of rape.  Prof. Gale was later convicted of murdering the DeathWatch volunteer, played by the easy-on-the-eye actress, Laura Linney.  Prof. David Gale is played by Kevin Spacey.  The professor uses much the same academic mannerisms as used by the mathematics professor, played by actor Stellan Skarsgard, in the movie GOOD WILL HUNTING.  The professorial mannerisms used in both of these movies, as well as by real professors, take the form of professors pontificating before their students, and making coy in-the-know statements about or quotations from ancient scholars.

MOST OF THE TIME.  Most of the time in this film is spent on two activities: (1) DETECTIVE WORK.  Kate Winslet plays a reporter who is hunting down the particulars leading up to the conviction of Prof. David Gale, with the goal of finding him innocent.  Kate Winslet's travels in her detective work lead to encounters with another volunteer of DeathWatch, played by a creepy stalker played by actor Matt Craven.  Much of Kate Winslet's efforts take place on death row in the prison, where she interviews Prof. David Gale; (2) SLIPPERY SLOPE INTO DEGENERACY.  Also, much of the time in this film is devoted to showing Prof. David Gale sinking into degeneracy and despair and alcoholism, following his false rape charge and ultimate dismissal from his faculty position.  An interesting and realistic part of theme is where Prof. David Gale walks drunkenly down a city street, muttering nonsense to himself, as pedestrians walk by and try to avoid bumping into the inebriated man.

COMEDY.  While this movie is not a comedy, there are some comedic moments.  The behaviors and rantings of the volunteer workers of DeathWatch are a bit over-wrought.  The acting and scriptwriting is perfect, and it entertains.  However, it must be pointed out that their rantings were somewhat exaggerated for dramatic effect.  Also, the rantings of pro-death penalty Texans, including the pro-death penalty screed spoken by the Governor of Texas, are also overwrought.  The contrast between the rantings of both sides is entertaining and perhaps, a bit amusing.  Please note that this movie is NOT AN ANTI-DEATH PENALTY MOVIE.  The anti-death penalty theme in this movie is just the topic.  The movie itself does not take any position.  The movie discloses that both sides of the issue are extremists.

IRONIC ENDING. Do not worry, I will not disclose the ending.  The ending is distinguished in that there are actually two endings.  There are two ironic endings, and both are compatible with each other, and both fit logically together.  The ending compares favorably with the best of the ironic endings from TWILIGHT ZONE.  The best of the ironic TWILIGHT ZONE endings are: (1) TO SERVE MAN.  ""It's a cookbook!""; (2) TIME ENOUGH AT LAST.  ""There was all the time I needed.  It's not fair.""; (3) STOP AT WILLOUGHBY.  The ending shows a hearse reading, Willoughby & Son; (4) NIGHTMARE AT 20,000 FEET.  The ending shows that the airplane has a torn up panel on the wing; and (5) LIVING DOLL.  The ending shows Talky Tina warning the mother, ""My name is Talky Tina and you'd better be nice to me.""  FIVE STARS to THE LIVE OF DAVID GALE and its two back-to-back ironic endings.",1480723200,,3982,5.024427480916031
