3543495,5,B001DYFD0O,"I would say my yoga is at an intermediate level, and I love Kurt Johnsen.  He's not annoying, and the day after I do his routines, I feel like I lifted weights in the gym!  There are 6 - 45 min workouts, and he includes variations for beginners.  I would recommend this for anyone!",1252713600,5,281,4.166666666666667
3543496,4,B001DYFD0O,"Have watched Yoga For Life on FIOS and wanted the DVD for use at my convenience and to take with me when I travel. It is the TV program without the commercials which is exactly what I wanted.  Instruction is excellent and it's easy to follow for beginner and complex enough for anyone more experienced with Yoga.  Very good, inexpensive way to practice yoga and fit it in to my daily schedule.",1245196800,8,393,4.444444444444445
3543497,5,B001DYFD0O,"I discovered Yoga for life with instructor Kurt Johnsen on the veria satellite channel, he is amazing. I considered joining a class but you really don't need too with him instructing you, Ive been doing Yoga for 2 years with this instructor and my whole body shape has changed, Im longer and leaner, alot more tone, I would recommend Yoga for life to anyone who is really serious about getting into great shape physically and mentally.",1243468800,12,435,4.7368421052631575
3543498,5,B001DYFD0O,"Yoga for Life is truly the best yoga show on tv.  Kurt gives you both the true mental and physical aspects of yoga.  I have gone through a 200 hour certification and through these shows I continue to build on my foundation, while further challenging myself both mentally and physically.  If you have the opportunity to take a class at one of his Dallas studios I HIGHLY recommend it.  His teaching is a life changing experience!!",1230076800,6,429,4.605263157894737
3543499,5,B001DYFD0O,"I was excited to find out that Veria had created this video from their Yoga for Life show. I have been practicing Yoga with the show for nearly a year and it has changed my life. Just in a year's time I've increased my energy throughout the day, eased aching joints and become leaner. I feel great and I can't wait to see what the future holds as I continue this practice. Twice in the last six months my DVR has crashed and I've lost all my Yoga for Life shows, now I will not have to worry about missing a workout. If you want to make a change for the better in your life, I highly suggest this DVD, it's taken directly from the show. Thanks Veria and thank you Kurt. This is a life saver!!",1225324800,24,692,4.0583941605839415
8295473,5,B001DYFD0O,Love Kurt Johnsen's yoga. Not a lot of unnecessary talk just instruction and a great yoga workout.,1437523200,,98,4.823529411764706
8295474,3,B001DYFD0O,"Kurt is a very good instructor, pleasant and easy to follow, however I gave this DVD 3 stars because of the numerous ""commercials"" placed throughout the practice; I found them very disruptive. I honestly would not have made the purchase if I had previewed it and have only used it twice.",1361923200,,287,4.647058823529412
8295475,4,B001DYFD0O,"If you love yoga that really moves you will definitely want these DVDs.  Good instruction on proper form and several different work outs, work at you level or challenge yourself to go further.",1358640000,,192,4.818181818181818
8295476,5,B001DYFD0O,"I began doing yoga with Yoga Zone 11 years ago with the TV program to relieve fibromyalgia pain for 24 hours at a time.  Other than horseback riding, yoga is the only exercise that I like.  Once my fibromyalgia was properly diagnosed as thyroid hormone resistance (hypothyroidism that requires a different medication), my endurance increased and my pain diminished greatly.  So I could do a more challenging yoga workout.  I used to watch the Wisdom channel.  So I've been watching Veria since it replaced the Wisdom channel on Dish Network.  I immediately was intrigued by Yoga For Life with Kurt Johnsen.  I began doing yoga to the TV & taping some of the episodes of Yoga For Life on VHS.  First I bought his DVD called Strength & later I bought the Yoga for Life DVD with 6 workouts from the Yoga For Life program.  I have 6 of the same DVD.  What I like about flow yoga is that I'm almost 64 years old & I've increased the bone density in my spine by 9% & in my femur by 6%.  I have shoulders that sound like rocks in a plastic bucket from riding accidents.  If I stop doing flow yoga for any length of time I lose range of motion in my arms.  I can live a normal life with almost no fibromyalgia symptoms & I look 20 years younger than my actual age.  I really dislike weight lifting and aerobics.  With flow yoga I can do one workout.  My cardiologist does only 10 minutes of flow yoga daily with a 3 hour class on weekends.  I do 45 minutes of flow yoga 7 days per week.",1317340800,3,1478,4.240143369175628
8295477,5,B001DYFD0O,"My husband and I started doing Kurt Johnsen's classes from a health channel called Veria that our cable provider had.  After moving across the country, we found that our new cable company didn't have the channel so I went online to see if he had any videos and found that the classes from Veria were made into a video series - I was thrilled!  Kurt is an incredible instructor.  He has such a warm, gentle, loving nature so listening to him throughout class is calming, despite the fact that his series is really challenging!  One thing to be aware of - the class was intended for a cable network so there are spots in the video where he will have you start a pose which if you were watching on TV, would continue throughout the commercial break.  When we played the DVD for the first time, we didn't pause the class at ""the commerical break"" but instead just went on to the next pose and kept going but I regretted it when the class was over.  I would highly recommend that when he sets you up for the ""commercial break,"" pause the DVD and continue with the pose for a minute or two like was intended because you will get so much more out of it and the class will ultimately be as long as it is supposed to be instead of the abbreviated running time.  If you love yoga and haven't taken Kurt's classes before, I really recommend ordering this series.  Namaste!",1310256000,2,1361,4.351778656126482
8295478,5,B001DYFD0O,As an aspiring Yogini I am always looking for ways to incorporate yoga into my daily life.  Kurt Johnsen is one of my favorites.  I love the DVD. As for delivery...I almost could not believe how fast it was delivered.  I ordered it on a Sunday and it arrived on Tuesday.  Great great great.,1290729600,,290,4.314814814814815
8295479,5,B001DYFD0O,"I really enjoy Kurt Johnsen's yoga classes and used to watch them on DISH TV.  Since I no longer can get DISH, I sought out a video and found it.  It's an awesome class!",1290297600,,169,3.9411764705882355
8295480,5,B001DYFD0O,"I first saw Kurt Johnsen's practice's on the Veria channel.  I was disappointed when we canceled cable and no longer had access to his shows.

In this DVD he leads a great yoga practice and has such a calming voice.  You get a great yoga practice with lots of encouragement to listen to your own body.  You can adjust the level to whatever you need that day.  Love this set and would purchase more in a heartbeat if he puts out any additional DVDs.",1282262400,4,448,4.285714285714286
8295481,5,B001DYFD0O,"I just love Kurt Johnesn's Yoga!  This dvd has 6 episodes from his tv show, each run about 45 minutes with new poses and different goals.  Love it. Love it!  5 stars!",1279584000,5,166,4.125
8295482,4,B001DYFD0O,I have watched Kurt Yoga for life episode in Veria channel for some time. I like his flow based yoga and clear and calming instruction. I have benefited a lot from it. My regular lower back problem has reduced after practising with episode on veria channel. DVD has six different episode and each is about 44 min long. I wish DVD producer really put something instructional during the break so as to simulate actual break allowing for warm up etc. Otherwise DVD is pretty good bargain for what it gives..,1269043200,3,504,4.611111111111111
