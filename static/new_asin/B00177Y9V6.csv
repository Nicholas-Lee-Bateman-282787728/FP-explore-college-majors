3168199,3,B00177Y9V6,"Shot in 2001 and finally seeing a release in June 2008, ""An Erotic Werewolf In London"" has many old-school Seduction Cinema fans anxiously anticipating the now-classic lineup of Misty Mundae, Julian Wells, Ruby LaRocca and Darian Caine. Filmed partially in London by William Hellfire and also closer to home by John Bacchus, ""Erotic Werewolf"" sticks decently close to the framework of John Landis's 80s masterpiece, but trades in much of the humor for girl-girl softcore tomfoolery. While it may not be the ""erotic parody"" longtime fans might be hoping for, it's got everything else you'd expect from a Seduction Cinema film. What's great about this one taking so long to come out is the packaging and presentation, neither of which would have been nearly as high quality back in 2001 or 2002. The film is presented in a 2-disc set, one containing the film with director commentary and the second featuring the full-length movie ""Night Of The Groping Dead"".  My favorite thing about this disc turned out to be a brand-new interview with Ruby LaRocca, who regales us with a look behind the scenes at what it's like to make a Seduction Cinema movie. She is very engaging, funny and honest. I'd like to see the company include things like this more often.",1209945600,17,1252,4.877934272300469

8265238,2,B00177Y9V6,"I dont't even know why I'm wasting my time with this review of a bad softcore skin flick...I mean I got nothing against them, it's just this one is not all that good.
Most ""scenes"" are as long as two minutes or so...I'm not kidding...some might extend to a whole five minutes but that's about it.
Not that most girls here aren't super fun to look at but they don't do enough for a long enough period of time.
Clocking in at a little over an hour long, they might of benefitted from stretching out the sex scenes as that's really the only reason anybody is going to watch this.
And for all of those reviewers that are ""I thought this was a werewolf movies not some skin flick"", did you guys land on planet earth yesterdsay or what?
It's called EROTIC werewolf in London, what exactly were you expecting?",1524614400,,802,4.3533333333333335

8265242,2,B00177Y9V6,"This movie I have really looking fowerd to see, thinking it was a really cool Werewolf film with a small twist..
like nudity/offering/erotic horror kind away if you get the point, but I really got disapointed when I saw it was just another stupid porn
movie where they  have a this girl thet is a werewolf hunting  sexy beautiful girls  to have sex with they and insted of orgasm she turns in to a werewolf (well if you can call a girl with big boobs and long whit hair on her arms and abit of hair on her body... long nails and long teeth of a werewolf tho)then she kills them.

This is the dummest and the stupist Movie I have ever seen!",1323475200,,639,4.170731707317073
8265243,1,B00177Y9V6,"The whole movie is basically a C grade porno. ''Special'' effects are awful and very cheap. Even in ''making out'' scenes they were cheating. A few times you could see they were making out with an air, not a partner. Only empty moves and moans, if you know what I mean. I can't write it in other words, because amazon don't let me post it. Like a last review. I have to change words on another ones, because they don't allow to use them in reviews. Werewolf scenes are repeating constantly. Yes, I mean it. They use the same scenes over ten times. As for the plot, there is a plot in here, not much of it but it's present.",1303430400,,622,4.191666666666666
8265244,2,B00177Y9V6,"I have no Idea what this film is but it's not a ""werewolf"" film..
The werewolf plot is kind of pasted on this film.
What this movie is really just a girl on girl softcore porn flick.
If your looking for that.. Then this is your film.

If not stay away.

it's all shot on video.
The werewolf makeup sucks and you only see it fortunately in the last 5 mins of the film.

About the only thing of any quality is the box art.

The only reason I give it 2 star's is that it's ok. softcore porn.
But not worth the money.",1250121600,,513,3.9038461538461537
8265245,4,B00177Y9V6,"An Erotic Werewolf in London is long awaited DVD release of a MIsty Mundae film that was shot several years ago.  The film is now available in a two disc collector's edition.  THis movie is part Interview with a Vampire, An American Werewolf in London and a whole lot of HLA.  It has the usual bad humor, off-the-wall-acting and the overall weirdness that you'll find in you typical Seduction Cinema production.  An eastern european she-wolf bites Misty and curses her with lycanthropy.  The werewolf decides to give a reporter the interview-of-a-lifetime.  Films splits into two story lines, one dealing with Misty and the werewolf who tells a reporter her life story.  The other disc has a gallery of MIsty Mundae trailers and a bonus film.

Highly recommended!",1233100800,4,763,4.952755905511811
8265246,3,B00177Y9V6,"An Erotic Werewolf in London tells the story of a lesbian lycanthrope (Anoushka, Play-Mate of the Apes) -- do I need to mention that the film doesn't even bother to give us character names? -- who is seduced by a bartender (Misty Mundae, Spiderbabe). After some post-coital biting, the bartender now suffers from the werewolf curse. Meanwhile, our initial lycanthrope heads to London to tell her story to a British tabloid. This plot device allows for a lot of flashbacks involving werewolves and lesbians. Meanwhile, our bartender is ill from the effects of the bite and is tended by a number of naughty nurses. Eventually, Misty's werewolf turns and meets a tragic fate.

The previous paragraph makes the film sound a lot more coherent than it really is. In reality, the 68-minute film skips from lesbian scene to lesbian scene with a minimum of dialogue and narrative drive. The couplings themselves are above average for Seduction Cinema, with some real chemistry between the participants and no annoying interruptions from guys in gorilla suits. Those looking for wicked werewolves should go elsewhere, as this film sticks with a minimalist aesthetic. We're talking claws, fangs, and the barest wisps of hair to preserve the erotic half of the ""erotic werewolf"" equation.

Ostensibly, the film's star is Anoushka, although her silicone-enhanced assets are atypical for Seduction Cinema films. However, fans of Misty Mundae need not despair, for she commands almost as much screen time as Anoushka, and gets the better pairings of the two, including encounters with Ruby LaRocca, Darian Caine, and Julian Wells.

Shot on three different formats, the video is a predictably mixed bag. It doesn't look horrible by Seduction standards, but it won't win any awards. The best I can say about it is that there are no problems which make it difficult to make out the ladies. The audio is slightly worse, with a lot of variability in the quality and volume of the various effects and dialogue. But, since there wasn't much dialogue in the first place, it's hardly a huge complaint",1216684800,23,2076,5.02906976744186
8265247,4,B00177Y9V6,"Although its title would imply that this is another of Seduction Cinema's sexy spoofs, `An Erotic Werewolf in London' is, for the most part, a straight forward softcore skinfest with lycanthropic eroticism added to the Sapphic couplings. The erotic content is pretty good with Misty Mundae looking stunning throughout. The other main players are Ruby LaRocca and Anoushka, both of whom are excellent in this movie. But Seduction Cinema aficionados be warned: the sex scenes between Anoushka and Ruby have been lifted from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Erotic-Diary-of-Misty-Mundae/dp/B000RUYYVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Erotic Diary of Misty Mundae</a>. It's true that these scenes happen to fit in with the `Werewolf' movie quite well, but it's disappointing that some previously unused footage could not have been found.

The action begins with Misty and Ruby in the bar that they run. Having closed for the night, the ladies are feeling frisky and get straight down to naked business on the counter. Anoushka arrives as the ladies are having a nightcap. Misty is clearly smitten by the newcomer and invites her into the backroom where more yumminess follows. Anoushka is a werewolf, her transformation occurring at the point of climax: a smidgen of additional body hair, extra long fingernails and large teeth, all the better to bite Misty with. And we all know what happens to those who survive being bitten by a werewolf, don't we?

So what's all this got to do with London? Not a lot. Yes, there are some scenes in London and we get to see the usual landmarks: Houses of Parliament, red telephone box (not many of those left nowadays, though) and the entrance to a London Underground station. Reluctant reporter from `The Daily Limey', Zoe Moonshine, is dispatched to get the scoop on the werewolf woman whose home is in England's capital city.

The cast is almost all female. The only exceptions are John Link who plays Zoe's editor(!) and Jeff Shields who plays Misty's doctor. There are cameos from Darian Caine and Julian Wells as Misty's nurses. Their intimate ministrations naturally bring out the beast in Misty. If you'd like to see Darian in another werewolf movie, you may like to check out the slightly dodgy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Curse-of-the-Wolf/dp/B000S6LPAA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Curse of the Wolf</a>.

`An Erotic Werewolf in London' is a decent softcore erotic movie. Some may be disappointed at the relative lack of werewolf activity, but the sex scenes are well performed and very nice to look at, and they're a little stronger than those contained in Seduction's recent releases. Misty, Ruby and Anoushka are wonderful in this movie. Unfortunately, Zoe Moonshine keeps her clothes on throughout, but for those who'd like to see more of this lovely lady, check out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Devil-s-Bloody-Playthings/dp/B000BH4BQ6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Devil's Bloody Playthings</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Les-Chic-2-DVD-Collection/dp/B000EQHTXG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Les Chic 2-DVD Collection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bikini-Girls-on-Dinosaur-Planet-Bikini-Goddesses/dp/B00097E744/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bikini Girls on Dinosaur Planet/Bikini Goddesses</a>&nbsp;all of which, like `An Erotic Werewolf in London', were directed by Bill Hellfire.

There's no behind the scenes documentary on this DVD which is a pity, but listening to Bill Hellfire (writer/director) and Michael Raso's (producer) audio commentary is interesting as they talk about the film's long road to DVD release (it began filming in 2001). There's a featurette called `Reminiscing With Ruby' in which the wonderful Ruby LaRocca talks about her films for Seduction and Factory 2000. ""I've never regretted anything I've done. I had so much fun making those movies, why would I be ashamed of any of that?"" she asks. She also points out that she would not have got any of the parts in horror movies outside of the Seduction Cinema fold (such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flesh-for-the-Beast-Unrated-Edtion/dp/B0000B1A0U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flesh for the Beast (Unrated Edtion)</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shadow-Dead-Riot-Special-Edition/dp/B000CEV3PU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shadow: Dead Riot: Special Edition</a>) if she hadn't appeared in films such as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dr-Jeckyll-Mistress-Hyde/dp/B00008O2ZL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dr. Jeckyll & Mistress Hyde</a>. On the audio commentary, Michael Raso talks about a Seduction Cinema actress whose feelings are apparently somewhat different to Ruby's.

Fans of Ruby LaRocca will be delighted to know that she has a major role in the film on the second DVD in this set: `Night of the Groping Dead'. In the Laundromat, having loaded the machine, Ruby decides to pass the time by having some ""alone fun"" after which, topless, she falls prettily asleep on a table. Then, wouldn't you know it, a zombie enters the premises. On seeing the charming Ruby, the zombie begins to grope her. Ruby is groped a lot in this movie, she's naked a good deal of the time and she's covered in blood a lot too, much of it spewing from her mouth and over her breasts. Now ensconced as Queen of the Zombies, Ruby desires a mate and who better to fulfil that role than Misty Mundae?

`Night of the Groping Dead' is something of a sleazy delight. Ruby is superb in this film. A lot of attention is lavished on her with the groping scenes particularly strong for a softcore movie and, as usual, the sex scenes between Ruby and Misty are lovely.

Seduction Cinema have produced a good package with this release. Fans of Misty Mundae and Ruby LaRocca will definitely want to add it to their collections.",1216598400,5,6088,6.137323943661972
