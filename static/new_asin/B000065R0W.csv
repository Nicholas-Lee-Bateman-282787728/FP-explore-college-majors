1894123,3,B000065R0W,"PHANTOM RACER is one of those guilty pleasure B-movies.  The cursed demonic car story offers nothing new.  The acting is sub-par and there are many implausible plot devices.  However, some of the kill scenes are pretty unique.  Overall, the movie is not boring and is an okay entry in this genre.",1280793600,2,296,4.745098039215686
