370569,4,6301801954,"10 stars for the scenery and photography. 3 stars for the story.

4 stars for the acting. Can't rate the DVD's quality - cuz I have not tried one. And a good old film of its era - I appreciate it for its' vintage style. But the scenery of this movie is awesome. And for that, (for me), gives me quite a bit to appreciate.",1133049600,,321,3.9384615384615387
370570,4,6301801954,THE TALL MEN is a very entertaining Western primarily set on a cattle drive with Clark Gable and Cameron Mitchell signing on with boss Robert Ryan. They must contend not only with the natural elements and marauding Indians but also with their conflicting unbridled emotions for Jane Russell. Director Raoul Walsh this time out seems to display a keen sense of droll humor taking advantage of his three male stars vying for the attention of Russell. Clark Gable as usual turns in a fine performance with his carefree charm and looks and predictably steals this film once again from an accomplished veteran cast.,1132012800,11,610,4.932038834951456
370571,4,6301801954,"Gable only made a handful of Westerns, but this ranks as his best period Western film. He plays a former Confederate who leads a cattle drive with brother Cameron Mitchell. Gable And Mitchell have formed an uneasy partenrship with Robert Ryan (who they tried to rob at the beginning of the film). Ryan is also romancing Jane Russell, whose a former flame of Gable's. She joins them on the cattle drive, much to the dismay of Gable, who doesn't want a woman along because it's dangerous, but who's also still brokenhearted over his and Russell's parting.

This is a very nice western with great scenery, good performances, and a simply smoldering performance by Russell in one of the alltime sexiest women's roles in a Western. Catch it when you can.",1107820800,4,749,4.7615384615384615
370572,2,6301801954,"Clark Gable and Cameron Mitchell star as brothers and cowboys who first try to rob businessman Robert Ryan, but end up partners with him in a huge cattle drive from Texas to Montana.  Along the way they pick up Jane Russell, who falls in love with Gable, but wants the rich lifestyle that Ryan can provide.
The story is hardly short on action.  There's blizzards, Indian attacks, cattle drives, and plenty of male/female friction.  But it doesn't add up to anything particularly exciting or even interesting.  It was a surprise to me, given not only the cast, but also the director Raoul Walsh, who certainly knew his way around action and adventure, not to mention how to pace a film.  There are a few good moments, especially the final drive with the cattle, but not enough to sustain any interest in the characters or the story.  The actors are fine, but the missing energy really hurts the film.  It's a large scale Western, but the scale doesn't impress.",1054944000,,959,4.6726190476190474

Besides, Gable never turns in a bad performance, and certainly that's the case for this movie. Jane Russel, Robert Ryan, and Cameron Mitchell rounds out this Texas cow drive movie, and, of course, with Jane, there's bound to be disagreement and suspense given the men in her lives. It's a good yarn, and the movie is well directed, acted, and there's plenty of conflict along the trail. The question is: will they make it to Montana where the cows are headed, and will Clark Gable win the heart of the feisty and independent Nella (Jane Russel) who plainly has her own way of thinking and doing things?

It is post Civil War and the drive faces Jayhawkers and the Sioux nation in the their drive north.  There is a great closing line as Stark says of Allison, ""He is what every little boy thinks he will be when he grows up and every old man wishes he'd been.""

Meyer (Chickasaw), Juan Garcia (Luis), Harry Shannon (Sam), Steven Darrell ( The Colonel)

Directed by Raoul Walsh

Our story is a familiar one, as in ""Red River"" (1948, this film is a good action western featuring Gable, Russell and Ryan all itching for the end of the rainbow and what money can bring them.

Great direction by Raoul Walsh and Leo Tover behind the camera with sweeping shots that we all love in a western.

Ryan is a cattleman who talks Gable and his brother Cameron Mitchell into heading Texas cattle to Montana -- on the way they meet up with Jane Russell and spark fly between her and Gable, but don't count out Ryan as he has big ideas for an empire and Russell just might fall into his plans -- at the end of the drive who will come away with all the cards, and where does ""Prairie Dog Creek"" fit in.

This is one of Gables best westerns and he is up to his classic style of acting, don't miss this one.  Highly, very highly recommend.

Beautiful and haunting score by Academy Award Winning composer Victor Young, songs by Ken Darby.

370964,2,6301801954,"I really wonder what the other reviewers saw in this picture. Jane Russell with her unruffled skirts and coiffures belongs to an another film. She was O.K. with Bob Hope, but not with Gable and Ryan. This is one of the worst films made with a lot of money. The story is full of cliches. Brian Garfield wrote very harshly about it in his excellent guide about western films. The Tall Men is a ""disappointingly hackneyed and mediocre, bloated far beyond its proper scale: overlong, underscripted, flabbily directed and downwright silly"". I agree with his opinion.",1256428800,2,561,4.854166666666667
370965,4,6301801954,"Writing under two pseudonyms-Will Henry and Clay Fisher -US writer Henry Wilson Allen wrote several enjoyable Western novels and The Tall Men is based on the Clay Fisher title of the same name .It improves on an already enjoyable book.
It opens in snowbound Montana uplands in the months following the end of the American Civil War .Two Texan brothers both former members of Quantrill's Raiders are seeking a new life in the West .The elder and more stable is Ben (Clark Gable ) ; he is a man at ease in his own skin who knowh himself and knows he has nothing to prove .His younger brother Clint ( Cameron Mitchell)is more impulsive and headstrong ,more bitter about the defeat of the confederacy and a man with a recent history of alcohol abuse .They rob a local businessman Nathan Stark (Robert Ryan) who suprises them by making them an offer of a business partnership .He is proposing to buy steers in Texas at a knockdown price and sell tham for a sizeable profit in Montana  ;the expertise of the two men ,especially Ben ,will be of enormous value on the trail drive .The proposal is accepted and the party set out for Texas.

En route they meet a party of settlers which includes the sensual and attractive Nesta  Turner (Jane Russell ) and when Ben subsequently turns away from the other two to ride back to rescue her from marauding Indians the two are snowbound in an isolated shack where a relationship begins to develop between them. The attraction is mutual but a barrier arises between them -Ben simply wants enough money to buy a small ranch ,but to Nesta ranch living is synonymous with the grinding poverty of her youth and she has bigger dreams ,dreams which fit perfectly with Stark's vision of ""owning half of Montana ""
She and Stark -an urbane ,articulate and attractive men -become an item and he brings her along on the trail drive ,much to Ben's disquiet . The trail drive is not without its hazards ,including Jayhawkers ,swollen rivers and most substantially of all a Sioux war party ,not to mention tension between Clint and Stark mostly arising from the presence of Nesta .Throughout it is Ben who is the more gung-ho in facing the external threats .Stark is a pragmatist who is willling to pay off the Jyhawkers and sit it out till the Sioux threat diminishes while Ben is more confrontational .

The trail drive scenes are superbly done and never was Cinemascope deployed so intelligently in its early years .The movie cries out for ther biggest screen possible as the limpid cinematography of Leo Tover is inspired ,filling the screen with panoramic shots of great beauty while veteran director Raoul Walsh keeps the action coming .The scene where the herd is used as a weapon against the Siouc is superbly staged and very excitingly done .Indeed ,as a trail drive movie ,while it does not surpass the classic in that style  ,Red River ,it is not so very far behind it in quality. Add an incisive Frank Nugent and Sidney Boehm script and you have the ingredients for an exceptional movie.

The characters are well developed ,Nathan being especially well drawn .He and Ben are the two sides of the Raoul Walsh her -Ben a strong stable figure ,Stark more like Cody Jarrett in White Heat -driven ,a tough go-getter aiming for the ""top of the world "",but without the psychosis and hysteria .Nesta too is not just a plaything -she maked her own decision at he end and is a woman with a strong personality and wry humour .

The acting is splendid .Gable looks at home on a horse and he looks like a frontoiersman -leathery face ,lean body and a man at ease with the world and all that is in it .russell brings a warm ,playful quality to her role and mitchell as ever is excellent .Ryan steals the show ,for me ,in the acting department though effortlessly conveying Stark's ambition without hamming it up and delivering the often quite flowerly dialogue with ease and style.

A quite magnificent Western and its relative critical and poular neglect is astonishing .See it ,please .",1254009600,3,4005,4.638928067700987
370966,3,6301801954,"The Tall Men has a great opening half hour, but once the snow clears it's pedestrian and overlong all the way despite the combined star power of Clark Gable, Robert Ryan and Jane Russell. The DeLuxe color is problematic throughout - the early scenes and studio footage look wonderful, but out in the wide-open country it tends to make everything on the trail look bleached out and lifeless, the early CinemaScope lenses probably exacerbating the limitations of the system. Still, there's some great dialog and Ryan gets to deliver the definitive description of his co-star - ""There goes the only man I ever respected. He's what every boy thinks he's going to be when he grows up and wishes he had been when he's an old man.""

Extras are limited to a stills and poster gallery, restoration comparison, original theatrical trailer and trailers for The Last Wagon, Yellow Sky and The Proud Ones.",1241654400,,892,4.830065359477124
370967,4,6301801954,"68 years old when he directed this film, Walsh brings his usual sense of humor, long experience with action films, and his uncanny ability to get his viewers involved with his characters.
This was the first of three films that Walsh made with Gable. The other two were: King and Four Queens and Band of Angels. All of them a worth more than a look.
Unlike his contemporary John Ford, Walsh was never nominated for an oscar.
Which means High Sierra, They Drive by Night, and White Heat, all went unnoticed by everyone except the public.",1231718400,,535,4.583333333333333
370968,3,6301801954,"Director Raoul Walsh made his fair share of epic movies in his time with The Tall Men a welcome addition to the list.  After the Civil War, brothers Ben and Clint Allison have drifted west to Montana, making money as highwaymen.  The Allisons get lucky when one traveler they're after, Nathan Stark, asks them to join him in driving a herd of cattle north from Texas to beef-starved Montana.  So after the long ride to San Antonio, on which Ben saves and starts to fall for a woman, Nella Turner, who survived an Indian attack, the Allisons and Stark head north with a herd of 4,000 cattle, battling Jayhawkers, Indians, and each other all the way.  Clocking in at two hours, the movie drags in spots but the pace picks up once the cattle drive starts.  It's a beautiful movie filmed in Cinemascope with lots of gorgeous locations from bone-dry deserts to snow-capped mountains.  Not a ton of action, but the final battle between Allison's cowboys and a Sioux war party is a good one.  Overall, not a great western, but a good one and one worth a watch for sure.

 When it comes to westerns, it'd be hard to do better than the three main leads.  Clark Gable should have made more westerns judging by his part here as Ben Allison, a tough former Confederate soldier driving a herd of cattle to Montana no matter what or who tries to stop him.  Gable's leading lady is the beautiful Jane Russell as Nella Turner, a young woman looking to find the right man with big dreams who likes Allison but can't seem to realize it.  A lot of westerns throw in female characters for the heck of it, but Russell's role doesn't feel tacked on, she more than handles her own.  Don't be confused though, the movie gives her plenty of scenes in various stages of undress to capitalize on her popularity as a sex symbol.  Robert Ryan is also strong as Nathan Stark, the gentlemanly businessman who teams with the Allisons to drive his herd, all the while battling with Ben for the money and the girl.  Cameron Mitchell plays Clint, Ben's younger brother who's good with a gun but still growing up.  Rounding out the cast is Juan Garcia as Luis, Ben's old friend and right hand man on the trail.

  The DVD, part of the Clark Gable Collection, is well worth it if you can track down a copy through a vendor.  The widescreen presentation looks great, especially compared to the old pan-n-scan VHS tapes.  Special features includes three photo galleries which are pretty extensive, a trailer, and three trailers for other Fox westerns.  All in all, an enjoyable western with strong performances from Gable, Russell, and Ryan.  Give The Tall Men a try!",1228608000,11,2628,4.580299785867238
370969,5,6301801954,"Robert Ryan's character, Nathan Stark, is based on a real person, Nelson Storey, who struck it rich near the boomtown of Virginia City MT(renamed Mineral City in the film), and, in 1866, used some of this money to drive a herd of Texas Longhorns from Texas to meet the pent up demand for beef by the gold miners of Virginia City. As in the film, he did have trouble from the Jayhawkers when he tried to drive his cattle through KS, he did have a major encounter with the Sioux in Wyoming, and the army did try to stop him from proceeding further on the Bozeman Trail because of Native American hostility. However, instead of selling all his cattle as food for the  miners,as in the film, a good many were used to establish the first breeding herd of Longhorns in MT. The other aspects of this film are purely fictitious, if entertaining, and mostly surround the give and take between Jane Russell, Clark Gable and Robert Ryan. Of course, we can rightly assume that, in the end, Russell and Gable will end up together, although it doesn't look very likely for most of the film.
  From my perspective, this film incorporates key elements from 3 previous films. As in ""Call of the Wild"", made 20 years before, Gable and companions rescue a beautiful young woman in dire circumstances in a snowy wilderness(not once, but twice in the present film!) The woman eventually has to choose between Gable and another man. 5 years later, director Raoul Walsh directed the Civil War western ""Dark Command"". Quantrill's raiders, a quasi-military  Confederate guerilla gang, were prominantly featured in that film. In the present film, Ben(Gable) and his brother Clint(Mitchell) have just recently quit Quantrill's raiders or some successor gang when they show up in Mineral City. In both films , the featured lady has to eventually choose between  a poor but heroic Texas cowboy or a sophisticated but overly ambitious rival, who throws money and promised status at her. The cowboy doesn't appear to have a ghost of a chance, but.....
  Of course, there some similarities with the previous ""Red River"". Both involve an epic cattle drive north out of Texas. Both involve occasional disputes among the leaders as to how to proceed or handle a dire situation at hand. But, there is no mutiny in ""The Tall Men"". Rather, the long drive sequence serves to better test the characters of the main protagonists and to give Russell's character more time to decide for sure who she wants to live with(Both Gable and Ryan qualify as ""tall"" men.) Russell's royal treatment on the trail by wealthy Stark reminds me of the spoiled tycoon in ""Call of the Wild"". Both merit their private bath tub on the trail!
  I thought Russell and Gable were generally excellent, with snappy dialogue and a good amount of sarcastic humor in their give and take.  Russell certainly serves to lighten the tedium of the long cattle drive compared to the much more limited female presence in ""Red River"". She talks of her hard life growing up on a ranch(where?), but she also seems accustomed to fancy clothes and jewelry. What was she doing in the Wyoming winter wilderness, trying to get to CA? Who cares. Ryan, as Stark, was stiff and unemotional, with little sense of humor. I don't know if this is typical Ryan or an intentional characterization to make Gable's character look relatively more appealing to Russell. As was true of most of his films in his last 10 years, Gable's character was certainly meant for someone a good 20 years younger than Gable, who looked all of his 54 years. However, a weathered-looking Gable seemed better than no Gable. The last 10 min. bring a few surprises in sorting out the final relationships between the principles, which have been simmering through most of the film.
  All-in-all, I found it an entertaining '50s western epic, shot in vivid CinemaScope. I don't agree with the generally scathing  reviews of the times, nor with the common very unfavorable comparisons with ""Red River"". The trail drive was perhaps a bit long, but a lot shorter than the real 1500 mile drive! Yes, Ben was lucky in his occasional risky bravado episodes, but that's what you expect of Gable. The relationship between Stark and Ben and brother Clint was certainly unusual.  I didn't get around to discussing Ben's troubled, more trigger happy brother. Remember that, as former members of Quantrill's raiders, Ben and Clint were used to robbing, burning and killing. The James-Younger gang would emerge as the final incarnation of Quantrill's raiders.",1210809600,,4526,4.838292367399741
370970,5,6301801954,"This is definitely one of the best Westerns of the Fifties--great acting, great scenery, and a great story.  Gable is great here, trying to hide his love for the woman played by Russell, who also sings a couple of tunes and sounds great. This is not a musical--its a western filled with everything--a big cattle and horse drive, Indian fights, and land stealers.  The scenery is great color and the way they show a pack horse getting lost in the river is something else-hope that horse was not really drowned.  It has some scenes in it that you would not think would be a movie this old--which makes it very entertaining.  As for Gable--what an actor in his time-that smooth grin and laughter-the mysterious character he always seems to play--Awesome!!!  If you love this era of Western movies I suggest you buy this one when you find it--its very rare!!!",1179273600,37,855,4.673333333333333
370971,5,6301801954,"In The Tall Men, Clark Gable plays a former Confederate Army officer who partners with Robert Ryan to drive a huge head of cattle from Texas to Montana. Robert Ryan owns the cattle and Jane Russell is the vamp that stands in between them. Cameron Mitchell is Gable's younger brother who runs afoul of Ryan.

Great performances by everyone, particularly Russell, who plays the vamp role for all it's worth, and great direction by Raoul Walsh, who knew action, knew Westerns, and knew what it took to make a great movies. This was by far the best of Gable's period Westerns, and one of the best of the 50s - the golden era of Western films.",1175644800,12,638,4.5

7816078,4,6301801954,"While this film has an excellent cast and good acting, the various parts of the plot have been done in other westerns and there is little excitement in the film that we haven't seen previously. Clark Gable and the actor playing his brother come to a town in 1866 that is almost snowed in with the intention of robbing someone. Clark had previously fought for the South in one of the gorilla gangs. They hold up a man for $2,000, a huge amount of money at that time. He offers them a job to buy cattle in Texas for between $4 and $5 a steer and bring them 1500 miles north for a sale price of over $40 a steer. Clark and his brother can make as much as $50,000. The brothers accept the offer.
Clark is able to get his buddies from the Civil war, virtually all Mexicans, to join in the long trek.
The complicating factors are: (1) Clark falls in love with a woman he saves from Indians during a snow storm, but she does not want to live on a ranch. Despite these feelings, does she love him? (2) The man the brothers wanted to rob makes out with the woman and she seems to like him.  (3) The trek north with close to 5,000 steers runs into trouble with people who want to steal from them, resulting in gun battles. (4) Clark's brother drinks too much, gets drunk, dislikes the man from whom they wanted to steal $2,000, who is now their partner, he dislikes this man, and wants to kill him. (5) This latter man is fast with the gun.(6)  Both brother's are good with guns. (6) Clark's brother is disgusted with Clark for not being proactive and rides away from the camp.",1480464000,,1567,4.237458193979933
