8549551,4,B00AB2O06W,"I first found out about this film in 1993 by reading&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Movies-We-Love-Plume/dp/0452270057/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Movies We Love (Plume)</a>&nbsp;(a wonderfully hilarious book btw--get it!) and recorded it off AMC or TCM about fifteen years ago. There was a very limited pressing on DVD and reasonably-priced copies are impossible to find, so I had to settle for alternate means. The movie looks pretty cheap compared to its contemporaries such as PEYTON PLACE. The jaunty score over the opening titles; the black-and-white cinematography, and faces youve seen all over television make NO DOWN PAYMENT seem more like a TV-movie than a feature film and the plot is like DONNA REED meets KNOTS LANDING as the squeaky-clean 50s couples deal with sordid subject matter that became fodder for the prime time soaps of the 80s.

I found the male characters in this to be more developed and interesting than the women. Tony Randall has a rare dramatic turn as a weak, alcoholic used-car salesman with big dreams but no drive to follow through. Sheree North provides support as his long-suffering wife. Pat Hingle is the hardware store owner with a social conscience married to the sensible Barbara Rush. Cameron Mitchell is the war veteran with a chip on his shoulder and a common wife (Joanne Woodward playing against type) and Jeffrey Hunter and Patricia Owens are the newlyweds who serve as our eyes and ears into this deceptive image of suburban perfection.

Racism, infidelity, sexual repression and abuse all rear their ugly heads before long stripping away the sheen of happiness for each of the characters. Not a perfect film by any means, and no doubt the Production Code still determined the fate of certain characters, but interesting to see how Hollywood was so willing to rip the band-aid off of the American Dream right smack in the middle of its most conformist era. FOUR and a HALF STARS.

8549555,5,B00AB2O06W,"NO DOWN PAYMENT is a drama in black and white, which issued in 1957.  The cast comes in husband and wife pairs, as follows:

(1) JERRY (used car salesman) and ISABELLE.  Jerry is played by Tony Randall, who can be recognized by his big nose.  Jerry is always upbeat, but he is an alcoholic, and his income is low.

(2) TROY and LEOLA.  Troy runs a gas station in town.  He is from Tennessee, and has a glorious war record, but he has a chip on his shoulder regarding his minimal career success, as compared with people who went to college.  Leola is his alcoholic trailer-trash wife from South Carolina.  Leola is played by JOANNE WOODWARD, who was married to Paul Newman for 50 years.

(3) HERMAN and BETTY.  Herman operates a successful home appliance supply store.  One of Herman's employees is Iko, a Japanese-American, who is admired by Herman for his dedication to his work.  Iko asks Herman to help him overcome race-discrimination against him, because Iko wants to buy a house at SUNRISE HILLS ESTATES.  Iko thinks that Herman has ""connections,"" and Herman is deeply sympathetic, but Herman is helpless.  Betty is an anti Japanese racist, and does not care about Iko's plight.

(4) DAVID (electrical engineer) and JEAN.  David can be recognized because he has a handsome, chiseled face, and Jean can be recognized because she resembles Sophia Loren.  In real life, the man playing David is married to Barbara Rush, who plays Betty in this movie.

SUMMARY.  Most of the film consists of bickering between husbands and wives.  Two of the couples (Jerry and Isabelle, and Troy and Leola) are in serious economic trouble, while the other two couples are not so bad off.  Some of the couples have children, and these children are shown as innocent victims who witness the bickering.  This makes for an interesting foil in the movie.  Essentially all of the movie takes place in a new housing development called, SUNRISE HILLS ESTATES, which is a tacky housing development, where the walls are thin and the garages are large, as is the style for many housing developments in California.  All of the couples are in ""each other's face"" because much of the bickering, alcoholism, and attempts at dilly dallying, takes place at parties involving all four couples.  I watched the entire movie twice, and enjoyed it because it presented realistic psychological examples of various family problems.  Another movie, ABOUT SCHMIDT with Jack Nicholson, also had some enjoyable bickering scenes.  AMADEUS also had an enjoyable family squabble in it.  It is my guess that NO DOWN PAYMENT devotes more time to bickering than any other movie in American cinema!

DIALOGUE AND PLOT.  The opening scene shows modern highways and cloverleaf structures, and glimpses of a moving van.  The van is driving to SUNRISE HILLS ESTATES.  We see billboards by a road reading, FAIRVIEW RANCHOS, ENCHANTED HOMES, DUTCH HAVEN, PARK VILLAGE, and SUNRISE HILLS ESTATES.  The pastoral implications of these billboards were intended as a mark of sarcasm that contrasts with the actual disharmony and stress of the residents.  David (electrical engineer) and Jean stop their Ford at a crosswalk to allow churchgoers to cross.  We hear little children engaging in chit-chat, ""I'll bet you $5,000 . . .""  The couple enter their new home, still bare and with no furniture.  They kiss.  We see children outside arguing, ""He will go to hell and burn up because he won't go to church.""  They are referring to Herman (manager of appliance store) and Betty.  The problem is that Herman is washing his car on Sunday instead of going to church.  The wife tells him that he should have waited until Tuesday to wash his car.  This is the FIRST ARGUMENT in this movie!  Eventually, we are introduced to the other characters, and one of them makes the amusing comment, ""Nobody in this development is allowed to own a house they can afford.""  David and Jean peer through their window into the next home, and smile when they see the light romance going on next door, between Troy and Leola.  [SPOILER ALERT]  However, by the end of this movie, Troy and Leola are not getting along particularly well, because Troy has raped his neighbor, and Leola decides to leave him, and Troy is accidently crushed when his car tumbles off its jack and crushes him in his own garage.

JERRY AND ISABELLE.  Next door, Jerry is engaging in his favorite hobby, drinking liquor.  ""Everybody knows its only medicinal,"" says Jerry, explaining why he is drinking in the middle of the day.  The wife exclaims, ""I wish you didn't have to work Sundays.""  ""I wish I didn't have to work period,"" Jerry replies.

PARTY.  The couples congregate that evening in Herman's house.  ""The worst day of my life was putting on civilian clothes,"" proclaims Troy, disclosing his biggest hangup, namely being a genuine WWII hero with a dozen medals, but having a humble job in a gas station.  The first sign of serious trouble occurs when Jerry (used car salesman) dances too long and too close with Jean (wife of the electrical engineer).  The electrical engineer looks on in disgust, but does nothing.  But Troy decides to come to the rescue, and he cuts in, and Jerry gracefully bows out, and walks to the sidelines.  ""Thanks Troy,"" says Jean, not realizing that at the end of the movie, Troy will rape her in her own home when the electrical engineer is away on a business trip.

""I feel lousy, I need it.  Don't look so sad doll, you'll get wrinkled,"" says Jerry to his wife, explaining his drinking.  ""You need help,"" says the wife.""  ""I'm strictly a social drinker . . . I like to drink, it does things for me, makes me feel like I'm somebody.""  ""I'm leaving you, Jerry,"" mutters the wife.  ""No such luck doll, you're stuck with me.""  Then, Jerry adds angrily, ""You're getting on my nerves, leave me alone.""  ""All you want to do is drink and chase every tramp in town,"" says the wife, who then slaps Jerry.  All of the guests stare at Jerry, and one of the children runs away from the backyard patio and into the house.

SHORT SCENES.  (1) At 20 minutes into the movie, we see Herman and his wife, smooching on the couch, with Herman  holding a cup of beer, and alternating between kisses and beer drinking.  This is only a short scene.  Herman and Betty is the only couple that is financially and emotionally secure. (2) Jean encourages David to switch from electrical engineering to sales, which makes more money (but staying with the same employer).  Later on in this movie, at about 52 minutes, David reveals that he will accept the assignment to be a salesman, which requires that he travel north to San Francisco.  (3) Troy and Leola are shown in their bedroom, and they complain about the fact that Herman and Betty are both college graduates.  Troy and Leola then smooch.

SPENDING THE NIGHT IN THE CAR.  Jerry spends the night sleeping in his car, because he is embarrassed about getting too close to the wife of the electrical engineer.  Jerry goes inside.  ""Why did you sleep in the car all night,"" asks his son.  The wife tells Jerry he should switch from selling used cars to selling new cars, where the salary is more secure.  They embrace, and Jerry whimpers for a moment.

CHILD FOR ADOPTION.  Troy comes home at lunch, and takes a moment to flirt with the wife of the electrical engineer.  Then Troy retreats to his own home, and he and his wife (both with southern accents) discuss having children.  Then major trouble brews.  We learn that Leola had given up their child for adoption.  ""I did try to get the baby back,"" argues Troy, ""I went to the hospital, but somebody already adopted it.""  ""Somebody, I'll make you proud Leola, real proud.""  Troy leaves, and Leola stands directly in front of the door of the refrigerator, facing the door, and she cries to herself.  Perhaps this represents that her future is like a closed door.  This is a great metaphor.

AT THE USED CAR LOT.  At 34 minutes into the picture (see how much has happened already!!!), there is an excellent 3-minute scene in the used car lot.  Jerry asks his boss for an advance.  ""Let's try to move a couple of cars,"" replies the boss.  An older couple arrives to view the used cars.  ""Take your time, we don't believe in high pressure in this lot,"" proclaims Jerry.  However, Jerry lays on the high pressure.  ""Sure is a beauty isn't she.  Why don't you get in, put your hands on the wheel . . . how'd you like to drive this car out now!!!  Right now.  With no down payment, and no payment for 60 days.""  ""How much is this car,"" asks the old man (Mr. Burnett), taking the bait.  ""You've got to think of it as an investment,"" replies Jerry, exerting more pressure.  ""Where are you employed,"" asks Jerry.  ""Little John's Hamburger Place.  I'm a short order cook,"" replies Mr. Burnett.  (This reply shows how pathetic is Jerry's job, that is, trying to sell used cars to an impoverished short order cook.)

ANOTHER PARTY.  Jerry succeeds in selling the used car, and he falsely believes that he is more financially secure.  ""What do you say we throw a wing-ding for the neighbors,"" proclaims Jerry to his wife.  ""Jerry, we can't afford that,"" she answers.  Anyway, halfway through the party, Jerry's boss materializes with Mr. Burnett, and they force Jerry to return the money.  Jerry has no money, so he jumps into his own car, and vanishes.  Instead, Jerry's wife gives her own money to the boss (she is not really delighted about having to do this).

BETTY THE RACIST. From 42-48 minutes in this movie, we learn about racism.  Iko wants to buy a home at SUNRISE HILLS, but he is turned away.  Iko asks his boss (Herman) to persuade the home developers association to allow Iko to buy a house, because Iko thinks that Herman has influence in the community.  Herman is genuinely sympathetic, but he only replies that he will think about it.  Iko is disgusted and walks out.  That night, Herman discusses Iko's plight with his wife Betty.  Betty does not want to help, though she is not really an overt racist.  Herman gets fed up with her lack of sympathy for Iko, and he angrily says, ""Betty, how can you call yourself a good Christian and talk like that???""

CONTINUING WITH PARTY AT JERRY'S.  At 53 minutes, the background music is an early vintage rock'n'roll song, THE DRIVE-IN ROCK, by Newman and Coates.  (Please note that Coates wrote the lyrics for many songs recorded by Sinatra, Tony Bennett, Sarah Vaughan, etc.  Newman wrote the score for HELLO DOLLY, and for many other movies, and that Newman is an older relative of famed, Randy Newman.)  Leola and David make flirtational chit-chat.  David scolds her, ""Why don't you knock off the drinking for the night.""  But they continue drinking liquor together.  Troy takes Jean to his own home, to show off his WWII medal collection.  He explains why he is so devoted to his WWII medals, ""Do you think it makes me feel like a man greasing cars and cleaning toilets at a gas station?""  Although they are alone together at this moment, Troy does not ""make any moves"" on her.  Back at the party, Troy's drunk wife reveals her family secrets to all, ""When I told Troy before we were married that I was pregnant, WHAM, he knocked me down!  Didn't you, big guy?!?""  Then Leola reveals more to all of the party-goers, that is, about giving up their baby for adoption.  She wonders out loud if the foster parents are capable of loving her child.  She starts to cry.  Troy hoists her on his shoulders, and carries her off.  ""I want my baby, I want my baby, I WANT MY BABY, I WANT MY BABY,"" cries Leola, as she is carried away.

JERRY IS FILLED WITH OPTIMISTIC BULL.  At 75 minutes into the movie, Jerry returns home (since he was embarrassed by the run-in with his boss and Mr. Burnett).  Jerry reveals his business plan to become a millionaire, by starting a buyer's service for used cars.  ""It will grow just like a chain letter,"" proclaims Jerry merrily.  But Jerry's optimistic bullxxxx only makes his wife disgusted.  She replies, ""Shut up, shut up, shut up, I'm through with you, get a job, be a milkman or a laundry man, you're just another guy like I'm another housewife,"" she shrieks.  Their son Mike comes in, hearing all of the yelling.  The wife is then alone, and she cries in despair.

FROM BAD TO WORSE.  The movie show more despair and more broken dreams.  Troy kicks in his television set, because his wife stated that she'd given up their child because she was afraid that Troy would kill it.  Troy also kicked in the television, because of his recent failed attempt to get a job on the police force, where he was denied the job because he had no college education.  At 81 minutes, Troy goes to the neighbor's house, and rapes Jean (David is away in San Francisco).  The movie image goes blurry at this point, so the viewer is left to guess what takes place.  After the rape (or whatever) Jean runs next door to Herman's house, and Herman offer to call the police and Herman's wife offers to call a doctor.  Herman calls the hotel in San Francisco, but David has checked out and is on the way home.  David returns the next morning, finds out what happens, and hunts down Troy and there is a big fist fight  -- a slugfest.  While Troy is busy fighting, Troy proclaims his grudge against college-trained people. David is not really injured, and he returns home to his wife, and his wife is ashamed of being a crime victim, but David is supportive, and agrees to share her pain.  At 98 minutes, Troy's problems are over, because he is accidently crushed to death in his own home garage, while repairing his car.  The film ends in the same way it began, in that there is a scene of church-goers.  Leola leaves town in a taxi, on the way to her home in the south, i.e., South Carolina.  We see a billboard reading, ""SUNRISE HILLS ESTATES  THE HAPPY ENDING TO YOUR HOUSE HUNTING.""  This makes for a brilliant sarcastic ending.  FIVE STARS for this fine movie.  It provides an excellent lesson in sociology and family psychology.  Really, this film has the greatness of TWELVE ANGRY MEN, but it has all but vanished from the American consciousness.  It does not have to be that way.",1397692800,11,14148,4.634421604191858
8549556,4,B00AB2O06W,"I came across this gem a few years ago on TV. It is the story of four young couples who manage to buy homes with no down payment in Sunrise Hills. Their lives are all very different, but they are all the same in the day to day struggles of married life. The cast is excellent and includes Tony Randall in a dramatic role which he does very well, Joanne Woodward, Jeffrey Hunter, Barbara Rush, Sheree North.....  Very absorbing story I look forward to someday having in my DVD library. They just don't make them like this anymore. A true classic.",1391558400,8,545,4.396039603960396
