8623017,3,B00GGZ7PHE,"The fact that Michael Schenker is not pictured on the front cover of this DVD should be your first clue. It does NOT contain the corresponding concert footage from the live album of the same name, although it does include some footage of Schenker era performances. What it does contain is a history of the band, along with commentary about the album offered up by several individuals who (with the exception of Pete Way) were largely unknown to me. The video clips were taken from UFO's TV performances long before they were the well-oiled machine that pumped out Strangers In The Night.",1430697600,,587,4.764705882352941

8623020,4,B00GGZ7PHE,"Really nothing new, but worth the price of admission for the early band performance.  If you're a fan of UFO, and especially the Schenker years, then this is something you have to own.",1405555200,,184,4.575757575757576
8623021,2,B00GGZ7PHE,"I thought this was the live recording taken from the cd with the same name. too many interviews not enough music I was hoping to hear lights out , but it was not on the dvd",1397433600,,172,3.8055555555555554
8623022,1,B00GGZ7PHE,"I was expecting the original concert upgraded.
This is a documentary narrated by Pete Way.
I went back to order the original concert and it is not available.
Very disappointed that Amazon's description didn't do a better job describing this.
How do I get the entire concert ???",1397001600,,277,4.791666666666667
