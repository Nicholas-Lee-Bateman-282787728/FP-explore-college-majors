8214763,5,B000UTOKIO,This is an excellent series.  I now have all five and it's a great way to learn about - and hear a complete work in classical music. Recommended.,1444435200,2,145,4.178571428571429
8214764,4,B000UTOKIO,This is very well done and the lecture worthwhile though not as cool as the commentary on the Beethoven symphonies by Joachim Kaiser and conductor Chrustian Thielemann. The violin concerto is only 30 minutes..they could have added a couple more pieces to provide more value.,1339372800,6,274,5.111111111111111
8214765,4,B000UTOKIO,A very worthwhile DVD not only for its musical quality but very well done presentation on the composition and the composer,1325980800,5,122,4.857142857142857
