8554852,5,B00ANRWDAA,Great SOV trash!,1466899200,,16,4.666666666666667
8554853,3,B00ANRWDAA,"This is horror shot on video style, 80's.  It's not top shelf SOV for sure.  Aimless plot, terrible direction, confusing editing, but fifteen minutes of it is fun.  If fifteen minutes out of an hour is enough for you, then check it out, if not, avoid with extreme prejudice.  Fans of shot on video horror will glean a nugget of entertainment out of this, but below average for sure.  Basically, if you're a collector of SOV, yeah, check it out, if not, AVOID.",1421193600,2,459,4.481927710843373
8554854,1,B00ANRWDAA,"This is a terrible movie, which I can forgive, but the release itself is so piss poor that it takes this film to a new low.  Avoid is a great word for this DVD.  Only one star because I had to.",1393200000,,193,3.682926829268293
8554855,1,B00ANRWDAA,"stay away from this one. it has everything bad about it..low budget, bad acting, bad laughable special effects.looks like it was done with a hand held movie camara...and the worse part.....the price!!!! it should be worth just  $2...",1360368000,2,233,5.131578947368421
