8327887,2,B000OYNSRO,"I liked this film but would have enjoyed it much better if it had english subtitles. It is clearly a propaganda film that shows Mao as a happy man who cares for everybody, nearly the exact opposite of real life.  It has some interesting scenes of Chinese daily life.  Credits include a few italian film makers, so maybe the Chinese had some help putting this together.  In some ways it was interesting to see a staged color film of Mao (an actor) rather than grainy black and white images.  A lot of extras were used to show the fanaticism around Mao.",1349740800,,551,4.425742574257426
