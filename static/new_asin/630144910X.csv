330837,3,630144910X,"A bit over-acted by the main female lead and the actress playing her mother. However, the supporting cast and other main characters well and are the reason I made it through the story. The main character is extremely childish, self involved and quite hard to watch. Fortunately, she changes a bit toward the end.",1466726400,,312,4.796296296296297
330838,2,630144910X,"Three things ruined this movie for me: There was something incredibly off-putting about Dora (more manic dullard than the intended quirky young adult?);  the acting would be OK for a small town amateur theater; it was just all around drab. It wasn't even visually redeeming. It feels like the movie equivalent of plain cream of wheat. I'm sure it has some substantial, nourishing ingredients if you want to consume it, but I couldn't get past the sludge factor.",1466640000,,461,4.910256410256411
330839,5,630144910X,"I'll give Lily Pons and Judy Garland a tie and give the win to Henry Fonda over James Mason.

Yes, Amazon encourages us to...stick to the item itself, so...

Just one more: the 1935 movie was offered as fantasy and the 1954 movie was offered as something all too real.

Continuing: I cannot say that fans of Pons will love it because I was only familiar with her name until I bought this VHS. So I can say, to the uninitiated, this is really..a ""dream"". She is magical. No other word to describe her talent and beauty. Not some exotic European discovery at the time, she is just *plain* beautiful. Indeed, that radiance coming across the decades and the film generations (the VHS transfer is passable, at best) can overcome her dated style of singing. (Dated in the way that Jolson, Crosby, or Kate Smith is ""dated"").

A Reviewer here said Fonda is awkward and I agree. One might expect a Fred Astaire in the part of the struggling composer, graceful and energetic. On the other hand, Fonda's loping gait is a nice contrast to the balletic Pons' movements.

Jerome Kern did the music and I can't say I found any of it memorable. I'll just recall a very pleasant emanation from LP.

Film buffs will certainly enjoy all too brief moments with Lucille Ball, Billy Gilbert, and one of my favorite supporting actresses, Elise Cavanna, who plays Promoter Darcy's all too distracted Secretary. Recall her as the loose-limbed patient in W. C. Field's The Dentist.",1374624000,,1455,4.6640625
330840,5,630144910X,Great movie with Henry Fonda. I saw this once on a classic station and just thought it was interesting. I never saw the beginning but with this VHS I saw from beginning to end! Entertaining!!,1359072000,,191,4.485714285714286
330841,3,630144910X,"Forget the plot, Henry Fonda and the rest of the cast.  Listen to Lily Pons sing ""The Jockey on the Carousel"".  Unforgettable!  The blues number ""I got Love"" is amusing too as Pons's French accent mangles the lyrics but that last note she hits is extraordinary.  Jerome Kern wrote the songs and the score should be better remembered. There is also an early appearance by Lucille Ball who is shrill and funny.

Thank goodness we have this film memorial of Lily Pons.",1136419200,5,465,4.621951219512195
330842,4,630144910X,"The music score is great. Lily Pons, of course, was a real singer and she performs Jerome Kern's music beautifully. As to Kern's music in this film, I think I am safe in asserting that no one alive today and working in the theater or films is capable of writing music such as this. (Kern wrote the production ""numbers,"" the incidental music was set by Max Steiner.) The film was obviously gotten together to showcase Lily Pons, so it's no surprise that along with great music and great singing we have a contrived and sometimes silly story. Not so bad, however, that we can't stand it for the sake of the music.

Unfortunately, the transfer to VHS is very poor. This tape was produced as part of a set of all the films in which Lucille Ball had appeared. In this movie, she has a bit part as a bored, gum-chewing American teenager dragged by her parents into sight-seeing Paris. It was Lucille Ball's first appearance on film. So the transfer was dutifully made to fill out the Lucille Ball collection, but those who produced this tape apparently felt no need to attend to the sound track, a great shame considering the quality of the score and the singer.

The sound transfer is particularly bad in the lavish, climactic last number. There is a break in the film/sound track that will knock you up alongside the head.

There is no great acting in this film, but it's all decently good except for Henry Fonda's astonishingly mediocre performance. He is wooden when he is not over-acting, with the result that his character is cardboard. Lily Pons was a singer, but she carries off her part with creditable acting skill. Some of that credit is no doubt due to director John Cromwell, who was known to have a peculiar talent, like George Cukor's, of drawing the best from actresses. Too bad he couldn't get more out of Fonda. Osgood Perkins and Eric Blore do much better in their supporting roles.

Four stars for the sake of the music. As to the quality of the transfer to tape, you'll just have to hold your nose. We can dream of a day when someone will restore this film and issue it on DVD. That's probably dreaming too much.",1122076800,,2127,4.53125
330843,4,630144910X,"Husband Fonda pushes his wife, Pons into a singing career. Although reluctant, she gives it her best shot, and becomes a great success. This sours Fonda, a struggling opera composer, so Pons uses her influence in order to get Henry's opera turned into a hit musical comedy... Once this is accomplished, Pons retires from the spotlights in order to raise a family. in Because MGM was successful in making Grace Moore a movie star, RKO wanted to follow suit with their contract player, French soprano Lily Pons: the result wasn't entirely in vain. This film featured up-and-coming 30 year-old Fonda in his first non-bucolic screen role. In the minor part of Gwendolyn Dilley (!) Lucy had her second featured-player role & 20 years later she would buy RKO studios!",1030579200,4,761,4.906976744186046
