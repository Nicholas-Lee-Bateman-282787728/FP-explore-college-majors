6423077,5,B00KE7PC66,"Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is a depressed vampire living in Detroit while his wife Eve (Tilda Swinton) lives in Tangiers. He is sadden that humans or zombies as he calls them, have not only polluted the planet, but have polluted the blood supply. He is forced to buy his blood from a clinic, while his wife manages to get hers from the Christopher Marlow (John Hurt). Adam is a collector and has old clutter around his house. He is an accomplished musician who once shared his life and works with the rich and famous, but now is a recluse, symbolized by the city in which he resides, drinking his blood from a cordial glass.

Eventually Eve comes to visit, then her sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) comes from LA, only to disrupt their lives. Their cities of choice symbolize their life styles.

This is an art film filled with metaphors and hidden clever dialog. It is not for everyone. It moves painfully slow to give the audience the feel of the long dull boring life of a vampire. Their clothing is outdated by centuries as are their belongings. Adam uses his bathroom as storage for all his clutter, encouraging his human quests to use the lawn. It is an interesting film, but doesn't contain the action and horror typically associated with vampire tales. The humor is hidden irony that may take a second viewing to grasp...clever, but far from a knee slapper. Typical of a Jim Jarmusch film.

6423144,5,B00KE7PC66,"I love, love, love this movie!  I can't recommend it highly enough.  The pace is appropriately languid and there are a lot of layers to this story - religion, science, social responsibility, what it means to be an individual yet still part of a couple, struggling against the defeat of humanity, the purpose of art (for self-expression or to change society), the value and cost of artistic fame.  The fact that the main characters are vampires is merely a symbolic device to further the plot; this isn't a vampire movie along the lines of Dracula or Underworld.  It seems clear to me that Adam and Eve are intended to be the ""original"" biblical Adam and Eve, cast out of the light for all eternity, subsisting off of the increasingly compromised human race that is destroying their Garden of Eden, while they foresee future calamities and know history by mere touch.  Adam suffers from depression and Eve and his music are the only things that bring him back from the brink over the centuries.  He overthinks and creates; she experiences and enjoys creation.  They compliment each other perfectly and remain separate individuals while completely devoted to each other.  The movie follows a brief moment in their eternal marriage and shows how they give each other the space and support to be themselves, while also always being one.  It's incredibly romantic, brooding, thought-provoking, wryly funny (Adam's doctor name tags!), and atmospheric.  If you like Glen Duncan's brilliant philosophical novel ""The Last Werewolf"" then you will love this movie!",1515369600,6,1553,5.03125

6423166,5,B00KE7PC66,"""Only Lovers Left Alive"", a film written and directed by Jim Jarmusch, is a brilliant fascinating trip. Starring Tom Hiddleston, Tilda Swinton, the late great Sir John Hurt, the late Anton Yelchin, and Mia Wasikowska, it's an exploration of immortality in a world of mortals. It's one of the few films I've seen to explore the realm of Vampires, in a thoughtful, contextual way. We sometimes despair as people, over our lives, losses, heartbreaks, and the world around us seeming to come apart more and more each day. The longer we live, the greater and deeper these things can impact us. But the classic question of what if one lived for centuries, even longer? Imagine that compounded, as these immortals watch humanity continually poison and destroy itself. And despair over all that's lost. This film moves slow, and lingers on its characters sorrows and joys, their losses, discoveries and rediscoveries. Brilliantly written and directed (think languorous here, this film takes it time, and nothing just rushes by), with brilliant performances all around, I've encountered nobody since Anne Rice (who's still doing it) who brings home this kind of exploration of living forever while the world around one doesn't, so powerfully and evocatively. Even a Vampire has to continue to be open to the new, to discovery, take nothing for granted, and learn to live in gratitude.",1509062400,,1375,5.088495575221239

6423181,5,B00KE7PC66,"Vampire Adam has fallen into a deep depression after becoming frustrated by the state of modern humanity--what he views as apathy around things that deserve respect, such as preserving resources, exploring philosophy, and pursuing the arts. His wife, who lives apart from him (she's in Tangiers to his Detroit), catches on and visits him to get him out of his funk.

More things happen, plot-wise (including a visit from Eve's mischievous sister), but the movie is carried by the quality of the performances and a script that explores truly interesting questions around how to find comfort (let alone enjoyment or inspiration) in what is, essentially, a dark age with few comforts.

Wonderful hypnotic, low-fi soundtrack and four of my favorite actors in the same movie. The dialogue is clever and interesting, and the set design/decor is fantastic, full of interesting and beautiful objects and furniture from various eras. The choice of locations is also very original, offering beautiful night scenes of Detroit and Tangier. There is a fair amount of humor and fun references to literary figures. The pace is leisurely which I think is perfect since it gives a sense of how vampires would perceive time and create their lifestyle accordingly - no reason to rush if you have eternity. On the other hand, the film also brings in a clever ecocritical lens, in which vampires are at possible risk of extinction due to an increasingly contaminated blood supply. Definitely worth watching this artistic film.",1501200000,,942,5.123376623376624

I won't say too much about the characters and who they are, because I think those little nuggets are best experienced by watching the movie and discovering them for yourselves. I will say, however, that this movie is slow moving in a most enjoyable way. If you're someone whose patience is easily challenged, you might want to pick something else, but if you're willing to relax and let the story take you away, you'll be happy with the journey.

He's the only reason I kept watching. He looks spectacular here. And I liked the music, was good to add a new channel to Pandora. I loved Dead Man. I got it to study Gothic movies, plus Tom Hiddleson with long black hair.

But come on. What a horrible movie, really, right? The ending was far more plotless than I'd even imagined it could be. So what? They almost never show real emotion anyway about anything, so what does anything matter?  No character arcs. No meaning. No surprises. Random moments that go nowhere. Stupidly opening their mouths with teeth that grow out immediately after drinking blood for no reason. Never wiping their lips. Episodic events not tied together by structure. His ennui seemed to be his flaw to be addressed through the plot but it never was.

It made me feel like maybe I wasn't eating or drinking enough and maybe that's why I felt so exhausted? But really, it was just from watching that movie. Ugh! I have to recuperate from this one.",1495584000,,1121,4.623115577889447

If you knew you had FOREVER you wouldn't be in much of a rush either. It is incredibly well crafted and acted, Tilda & Tom were stunning in this. Their age old love story had such nuance, tenderness, realism & world-weariness to it. The sets were filled with such perfect decaying beauty and fantastic detail.

Tilda Swinton is so believable inhuman in this role that you can't look away (& Tom Hiddleston is enough like Dream from Neil Gaimen's 'Sandman' comics that you realize why there were so many whispers about him getting the role in the film adaptation). The humor in it is dark irony & the chemistry between them feels very real. It is a fantasy narrative about love & depression & long distance relationships & getting discouraged about the state of the world.

6423388,1,B00KE7PC66,"There is nothing remarkable about the characters, nor the story. The love amounts to the familiar languor with which they drape themselves over each other in sleep. The so-called crises that they meet are dispatched with barely a ruffle. No existential questions are raised about the undead condition. Their relationship to humans is accounted with a few cliches. Even the aesthetics of the actors' appearances and of the set were messy, tired, and disengaged. Even if one takes ennui to be the overriding gloss, it fails, because at best we are spectators to the characters' world-weariness. The film never grips us enough to feel with or for them.

""Only Lovers Left Alive"" is a film about the real problems of immortality:  boredom, anonymity, a safe and reliable food supply .  Tom Hiddleston's Adam and Tilda Swinton's Eve are perfectly matched.  Jozef Van Wissem & SQRL's soundtrack darkly reflects Detroit's urban wilderness. If vampires were among us, one could only hope they would be so languid, intelligent, and careful of detection.  Mia Wasikowska's Ava adds the adolescent element no one can resist.

6423418,5,B00KE7PC66,"I wasn't sure what to expect when I came across this movie, but I decided the combination of vampires and Tom Hiddleston was worth a try. I confess I'm a literature and film snob; I demand high quality screenwriting, acting, and plot before I waste my time writing a review. I'm happy to promise you will find ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" to be a film unlike any other you've seen; one well worth the time of watching. However, it's not a plot that will have mass appeal, nor will its true meaning be understood unless the viewer fits into a certain age and/or lifestyle demographic (e.g. over 30 and married). Had I watched this when I was a teenager--or even in my early twenties--I'm certain I wouldn't have understood the film's central theme. The brilliance of this movie is its original portrayal of marriage--the mundane trials and the deeper, ritualized bond of two people acting as one. I think it important for potential viewers to be aware this film is not really a vampire movie in the same sense that ""28 Days Later"" was not truly about Zombies. This is a film about marriage--a good marriage--that uses the eternity of vampirism to emphasize their common core value: ""Till death do us part."" The plot is slow and cerebral; it's full of subtle surprises that will be missed if the viewer has a limited background in classical music, literature, or historical antiquities. But if you're older, married, and loved Western Civ in college, this will be a movie to cherish. If you're looking for a great vampire flick, you will probably be disappointed with the movie's slow pace.",1462320000,2,1584,4.722021660649819

6423432,3,B00KE7PC66,"I never understood Jim Jarmusch's art life so I tried to avoid watching his films. I saw this movie just because my script that I am writing now is titled <Those who loves won't die>> I wanted to make sure it won't be the same category with his movie.
 It was far from being similar. The movie has nothing to do with the title. It is just not my style just like his other films.
 After watching it, there is nothing left in my head except the images of cool shot of Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston hanging around walking slow, and so on.
 Drinking blood in the glass because it's 21th century and it is not cool to kill people is not new. I've already seen from other movies before and it's all cliche.
 when Tilda Swinton comes to meet her old lover Tom Hiddleston, I really expected something to be happened. Something really big. A crash, a big love story. A vampire love. Like a love that I have never seen before. And some human involved too. But nothing. The movie was too quiet.
 Mia Wasikawska's appearance was a rain to a long drough to me. She was hillarious, makes trouble, and of course happy go lucky vampire.
 It is fun to watch both Mia Wasikawska and Tom Hiddleston again together in one movie since I've enjoyed the other movie CRIMSON PEAK which both actors acted together.
 All and all, if you are not a Jim Jarmusch's fan, this one is still an ok movie to watch since it is the mildest movie he made. If you see his other movies, you will definately say what?
 This one at least has good music and cool shots, great actors.

6423448,4,B00KE7PC66,"What at first appeared to be a masturbatory indulgence of melancholic filmmaking turned out to be a luxuriously downbeat examination of two romantically archaic vampires who have lost their passion for life. Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton play Adam and Eve whose lives have become reduced to depressingly splaying themselves against crimson furniture as they nostalgically pine for the sophistication and artistry of the 15th century. Their vast knowledge and specific tastes in music and style gives off the impression that they potentially were members of a high class or educated background who are now left to waste away in the detritus of Detroit. Thus making them the ultimate pompous snobs and yet dejected beatniks all the same.

But apart from their artistic disconnection to our modern age, they also possess a nihilistic attitude having bared witness to the degradation of our society whether through pollution or scientific expansion. What I enjoyed about it the most though is how the story becomes an incredible metaphor for drug addiction, stds, and ultimately the extinction of a species. Adam and Eve's gloomy disposition and constant desire to acquire ""the good stuff"" portrays a parallel to an addict couple finding love within their shared misery of drug abuse whilst coasting through life.

However, with humans subjecting ourselves to an endless number of chemicals, drugs, and processed food, Adam and Eve not only search out the best blood for its taste and uniquity (also playing into their pompous personality) but for the dangers of being contaminated by unclean blood. Which creates an easy yet clever metaphor for the potential accident of an infected needle. And lastly, we're ultimately witnessing the slow and tragic loss of an ancient species brought upon by the destructive nature of society. Adam continually grows sickened by the world he inhabits constantly referring to us as zombies who have squandered the world's gifts whether they be nature or the brilliant scientists who were silenced out of ignorance. And with the blood of the world now having become tainted, they are left to contemplate existence and desperately search for meaning in a life that appears to be drawing to a close.

I love finding vampire media that completely goes beyond what you expect from vampire stories. Near Dark, Let the Right One In, and Shiki are some of my favourites and I am happy to say Only Lovers Left Alive fits my criteria. Though it is a slow burn film that could've been trimmed down, it is a great representation of what the image of ""slow burn"" is. A match faintly igniting into a bright flame that trickles down to the end as it mesmerizes you with its flashing orange torrents and sullen blue core.

John Hurt is wonderful as Christopher Marlowe; who (spoiler alert) apparently DID write Shakespeare's plays. Tom Hiddleston is fantastic, a Byronic sort of compassionate old soul. Kind of if Byron became a reclusive Rock Star. His wall of heroes; portraits of the great artists, poets, scientists and musicians he's known is worth the price of admission.(The fact that his house is wired up with technology created by Tesla is a wonderful little aside.) Mia Wasakowski is a petulant train wreck of a fragile flower and makes the plot of the story move along nicely. An unusual take on the Vampire mythos, and well worth owning for fans of the genre who like their stories timeless, unusual and deep. For the MTV generation it may move a little slower than you are used to, but I think that is an attempt on the part of the director to give one a sense of what time is like for an immortal being.

If you are parochial, barely literate, easily bored, uninterested in philosophy, and only able to appreciate cookie-cutter music, then avoid this movie at all costs.

Once I knew what to expect, I actually enjoyed the depth of characters and the story, and now I'm a pretty big fan of this movie. Be advised: there is no climax, no central drama that the story spins around, and no core action. If you are waiting for something exciting to happen or jump out at you, you'll be disappointed and bored (admittedly, there are some tediously slow scenes). This is more of a character builder and a thought provoker. To me, this was more a story about depression and survival that just happened to include vampires.

The two main characters of Adam and Eve are marvelous! Yes, it is slow developing, and this is where some audiences will have problems with it.

Whether or not you can feel such a vibe or can enjoy style simply as the outflow of artistic feeling (like with Godard films) will determine whether you can like this movie. The film is not so much driven by plot; it is like music that is more about mood than melody; it is more about what keeps vampires going in their esoteric dystopia where the blood of life is stagnant and contaminated. Personally, I enjoyed it quite a bit, as I have most Jarmusch films. They have an authenticity and sincerity to them, and one gets a feeling of love for music and creation. Various aspects are easy to critique, but I do not see the point. In the film world, execution and polish (if it is right to call CG that) are common, while spirit is rare, and so I rate this one right up.",1444003200,,938,4.245810055865922

Since watching the film Only Lovers Left Alive I bought the soundtrack, which complements the film. Film and music generate a dark mood and atmosphere. The music is psychedelic/Gothic and creates a unique and distinctive sound.

Only Lovers Left Alive is a must see for those who are seeking an intelligent and thought provoking Gothic tale and mood piece. Its not a traditional vampire story that relies on blood-sucking horror and violence to sustain an audience. The mood, tone and music create a film that relies more on atmosphere rather than drama. Its a thematically complex piece as well as including traditional Gothic themes, such as the romantic outsider. It also interweaves modern concerns, such as urban decay and climate change.

But with vampires who are too evolved to kill for their food. Despite this, the film can be a bit hard to follow or relate to in its very hipster-esque, borderline pretentious execution.

This film carries a lighter tone than many vampire movies and has a very smart focus on the two main characters and their importance to each other.

I would recommend going into the movie with no bias or expectations. Besides being a huge fan of the two main actors I pressed play as a total skeptic and was thoroughly delighted with everything.

At night the vampire traipses around Detroit, sees the abandoned old Packard car plant and notices Jack White's house.  In the denouement, he joins his lover in Morocco where, out of desperation, they have to get blood the old fashioned way, by biting the necks of living beings.

Rarely does a vampire movie actually talk about vampires and what might be the ailments of immortality. I admit, this one might have been harder to watch if not for the immense charisma and talent of lead actors, and I am a big fan of Tilda and Tom, but that is not the only upside. This change of pace is more than welcome, pour in your favorite drink, lean back, but keep your brain on, and yet try to experience this one on an emotional level. Let it wash over you with the atmosphere, the dialog, slow build up of the characters as you discover them layer by layer, and even more by unsaid things.

6423571,5,B00KE7PC66,"Love the movie, but seems that there were at least two released versions. I saw a downloaded 720p version at a friends house and we both loved it. He later downloaded a 1080p version, and one scene in particular was chopped up. When Adam goes to the hospital, I think the first 720p video showed him driving up to the hospital. Then, he is seen simply standing behind 'Dr. Watson' while the Dr. is looking through a microscope (a wonderful performance by Jeffrey Wright, who steals the scene in every way). The Dr. is startled by Adam's presence, there's some banter about the  blood supply, the age of the stethoscope Adam carries, and about vitamin B deficiency, and Adam leaves. The camera stays on the Dr. while he goes back to his microscope...he pauses and then turns around again quickly to confirm that he's alone, as he's obviously spooked. And as Adam walks out of the hospital, he lingers hungrily over the dripping blood from an emergency room patient.

There may be other scene changes, but cutting the one in the hospital is terribly annoying. Jeffrey Wright's scene adds so much to the atmosphere, and is one of the few scenes where our protagonists interact with humans ('zombies', in the parlance of the movie) who have a pretty good idea of who they are, or at least 'what' they are. Not to mention the creepy walk through the emergency room with the bleeding patient.

So...is there a BluRay version that contains this scene? Was it only released in some other country? Does the BluRay for sale here on Amazon have this scene? Or perhaps the option of playback where this scene is included? If not, I can only say that a 'Directors Cut' is certainly called for.",1429747200,,1680,4.64983164983165

It's full of unexpected humour and dry observation about the human condition.

The dialogue is never boring and the silent parts of this movie are the perfect invitation to reflect upon certain aspects of the world we live in. Jarmusch never spoon feeds you the answer. Instead he politely opens a door onto the possibility of thinking about something new.",1428883200,,515,4.863636363636363
6423578,4,B00KE7PC66,"Jim Jarmusch is hardly prolific, when it comes tom output, and when he makes a film it is always going to be interesting. Here he delves into the lives (or deaths) of three vampires - though the use of that word is strangely absent in this film. Tilda Swinton plays Eve - she lives in the laid back idyll of Tangier. She is a modern vamp and she relies on Christopher Marlowe (yes The Marlowe) -John Hurt - to get her `the good stuff' from an apothecary.

Meanwhile her husband Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is living the life of a rock and roll recluse in the decaying wasteland of Detroit. He has a gofor to do his bidding but also has his `supplier' while he makes music on ancient guitars. Now Eve decides to visit and their reunion is given a rude awakening when her estranged sister turns up.

Now the plot is pretty simple in that you could have told the whole lot in a short film and this lasts just under two hours. However, as with all great journeys it is the actual travelling that will often be the best part - with the destination often a foregone conclusion. This is `lyrical' and I read one review that said it moved at a `glacial pace'. Well to some it will seem like that but the performances from all concerned have to be relished to be appreciated. This will not be to everyone's taste but it certainly managed to keep me pleasantly occupied for the duration - but not too pleasant - which I think is the whole point.",1428710400,,1429,4.308550185873606
6423579,5,B00KE7PC66,"Adam is a vampire estranged from the mortal world. Apparently once a famous rock musician in  his last incarnation, he hides out now in his run-down mansion in a secluded and deserted part of Detroit, composing music and collecting rare stringed instruments which his mortal friend Ian brings him. Adam despairs of what humans (called by him ""zombies"" have done to the world, how they've treated the truly genius ones who might've saved it, such as Copernicus and Tesla, and reminisces of the many musicians/composers he helped to greatness by giving them his music to claim as their own. Though he's married to Eve whom he loved passionately, they are also estranged...she living in Tangiers where she's kept supplied with blood by Christopher Marlowe who is now so old he's crippled and gets about on crutches.  Speaking to Adam by phone, she decides to come to him to try and bring him out of his depression, not knowing he's had Ian fashion a wooden bullet for him with which he plans to end it all. Eve does indeed revive Adam and they are happy and then her younger sister Ava, disliked by Adam, spoiled and coddled by Eve and undisciplined, hedonistic, and utterly selfish, shows up uninvited to disrupt their lives and destroy everything, sending both Adam and Eve back into the life led by fictional vampires.

What can I add that hasn't already been written by others?

If there are real vampires in the world, this is probably how they would live...disgusted and bored by having seen it all and wanted no part of the world, but having to emerge into it occasionally in order to survive. Adam's reactions to Ava are amusing and no less human than any man who isn't particularly fond of his in-laws. Their method of obtaining blood is nonviolent and while illegal, completely--pardon the pun here--bloodless. It was interesting to see Tom Hiddleston portray someone not the villainous Loki for a change, and also someone not intent on conquering the world but rather withdrawing from it.  The acting is subdued and perfect for the theme...no violent blood-rages, bloodshot eyes or flashing, dripping fangs. There are many tongue-in-cheek moments, in lines spoken during Adam's as well as Marlowe's reminiscences, and in the names Adam chooses to use when he goes to the hospital to get blood from his physician-supplier. The ending leaves one with a sense of dismay as Adam and Eve are forced back into becoming ""creatures of the night"" by Ava's thoughtless noncaring actions.

My one wish...that the camera had panned slowly over the wall holding the portraits of ""Famous vampires through the Ages"" so we could see how many personalities were housed there.

If you're expecting something a la ""Blood of Dracula"" or ""Dracula Untold,"" this isn't the film for you...this is a thoughtful, sensitive, artsy story lavish in scenery and at the same time spare in action.",1428710400,,2873,4.899176954732511

6423589,5,B00KE7PC66,"Big, unkempt rocker hair, kickass shades, century-old dressing robes and lovely vintage gloves; the best love story I have seen all year. Now to the good stuff! Just like our lives, the average movie today is usually very fast-paced. Only Lovers Left Alive is the opposite. So get ready to kick back, pour yourself a drink, and slow down to enjoy this film. Don't bypass it just because you see the word ""vampire"". These vampires don't sparkle in the sun, nor would they ever dare venture out during the day unless they wanted to fry. They don't go off gallivanting in the forest with teenage girls, or claim to be vegetarians by hunting deer. Enter Adam & Eve: brilliantly played by Hiddleston and Swinton. These characters were the much-needed breath of fresh air to remedy the watered-down, sparkly vampire-situation in Hollywood. Never have vampires been so groovy, so truly cultured, and oh so human. (Well, of course they love human blood, O- being their favorite type). They toil with typical daily life problems, just a tad differently. They put headlamps on when the power goes out in the house, they grumble when they didn't get enough sleep the ""day"" before, they have annoying family who comes to visit, etc. Adam is depressed and pissed at the ""Zombies"" (humans) and how they treat the world. He's miserable. We can get there too if we sit for a good hour and come up with a ""litany of every zombie atrocity ever commited"", and then we will feel just like Adam, and possibly become hermits. Eve is the light everyone would need; she's full of life, curious, and chooses to thrive, not wallow, despite the fact the world around them has gone downhill because of how the ""Zombies"" treat things. Shes always looking on the bright side. She's an excellent reminder of what matters in life, and how to really live it. Adam with his pack-rat lifestyle and refusal to allow new technology into his home, and Eve with her lovely books and nifty iPhone. Tons of complexity to these characters, and they don't need to say much for you to see it. Either way, they are so wonderfully easy to identify with, despite their vampiric tendencies. Throughout the movie you see the sweetness of a love, marriage, and friendship which has endured centuries continue on. See Adam and Eve kick back, play chess, eat ""blood on a stick"", talk about diamonds in space that sound like gongs, and of most importantly, show their undying devotion to one another (no pun intended). Lastly, you must pay attention! The humour is witty, dry, and rather dark. But you have to pay attention in order to catch it--if you glaze over for a moment you might miss it. In a way, this is a very gentle movie; refreshing, and will leave you chuckling at lines such as ""look at that s***"" (I promise you'll understand), and ultimately your heart feeling quite happy. Despite it's dark backdrop, it's a light-hearted film in a surprising and unconventional way. An applause for Jarmusche's brilliant work, the lovely screenplay, and last, but not least, the absolutely amazing cast. You won't be disappointed!",1428192000,2,3079,4.778611632270169

Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton are a revelation and hold the film together so well.  I have to say, the first 30 minutes were a hard slog, but then it's Jarmusch so that's not surprising.  Until the couple get together it all feels a little too arty and pretentious for me.  But once they are on screen together, holy hell it is the most beautifully romantic couple I have ever watched.  I'm not even sure the movie is really about vampires so much as it is about ennui and the power of endless love.  But it does offer some interesting twists on the narrative.  Beyond that it seems Detroit is now the go to place for apocalyptic locations and I can see why, desolate, brooding, dark - a sadly perfect place to shoot.

6423617,4,B00KE7PC66,A good movie that is typically and uniquely a Jarmusch creation. On one hand it strikes you as a deceptively simple story that tries a little too hard to be a hip and cool vampire movie. . . and often at the cost of a potentially timeless love story. But on the other hand I am almost sure here that Jarmusch has set up a story that strategically mocks (often in very funny ways) Hollywood/ the American dream and it's alienation of the traditional artist.  And if one is a fan of Jarmusch they will instantly recognize  his signature genius at portraying characters in a perpetual state of modern alienation and loneliness. And Tom Hiddleston's character is a classic figure for being lonely and lost in a modern life that he doesn't want anything to do with it. I might mention that Tilda Swinton is so beautiful here in her mid life immortality that she alone makes things worth watching.  But I really think it's the stand out performance of Tom Hiddleston that makes the movie worthwhile.  Hint: Keep in mind as is the case with almost all Jarmusch films that a second or third watching is required in order to catch the overall affect/,1425254400,3,1141,4.5512195121951216

6423638,2,B00KE7PC66,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I'm not a big fan of most vampire flicks since the subject has not only been done to death (no pun intended) but also because the idea of a human vampire is strictly a fictional construct and hence not a character that one can take very seriously at all. Director Jim Jarmusch has decided to debunk the genre by updating and treating it somewhat as a black comedy. His protagonist is ""Adam,"" a depressed vampire hipster, who enjoys listening to his own dirge-like rock compositions and is proud of his collection of vintage guitars, supplied by his human gofer, Ian, who is part of the local rock scene. Adam asks Ian to obtain a wooden bullet, which he may or may not use to eventually kill himself.

Soon enough, his wife Eve (they've been married for centuries), has just left 400 year old playwright Christopher Marlowe (also a vampire) in Tangier and comes to Detroit hoping that she can cheer Adam up. Over half the film features little conflict between Adam and Eve and aside from engaging in some rather dull conversation, they occasionally leave Adam's home and drive around in a mostly deserted and abandoned Detroit.

Finally something happens past the midpoint; Eve's sister, Ava, pays a visit to the couple from Los Angeles. She ends up killing Ian by biting his neck and drinking his blood. Adam and Eve are appalled by her behavior (since modern vampires don't do that sort of thing) and kick her out of the house. They then dispose of Ian's body and head to Tangier after a bunch of Adam's fans appear outside the house.

When they discover that Marlowe is dying from contaminated blood, they realize they have no choice but to whip their fangs out and kill an unsuspecting couple they meet on the streets. That's basically it--virtually no plot, with a narrative that proceeds at a snail's pace. Score some points for atmosphere, but Jarmusch's tale is as bankrupt as Adam's blood supply. In short, proceed at your own peril!",1423612800,2,1984,4.70893371757925

After living for centuries, there is a pondering on the existence of humanity and ones own life. The Lovers, though close due to their bond, live in a kind of isolation of their own, yet worlds apart. Nothing too bloody, nor crazy, or manic. In fact the entire move rather saunters along at a pace of its own accord, though ends rather abruptly. The music is hypnotic slow, errie, and sensual. A good movie to watch in the evening due to its rather slow trancelike pace. I enjoy outside the box type movies and things out of the ordinary, though can be honest and say if you are a fan of vampire gore, blood, and lots of action, you may not enjoy this movie. It is quite beautiful and the actors do a great job at making the vampire seem as almost an ""ordinary"" creature who is among us and entirely undeteced by most.",1420675200,,914,4.350877192982456

6423666,4,B00KE7PC66,"Jim Jarmusch (Ghost Dog, Broken Flowers, Dead Man, Coffee and Cigarettes, etc) enters the bloody vampire realm in this very long and tedious film he both wrote and directs. He did assemble a respectable cast and relies heavily on dark atmosphere and bad hair but despite all the clever historic references this is a film that appeals to a certain audience - a VERY big certain audience who can't seem to reach satiety for blood consumption.

The ONLY TOW LOVERS LEFT ALIVE are the centuries old Adam and Eve. Adam (Tom Hiddleston) is a musician and electric guitar collector (his source is another vampire Ian - Anton Yelchin) and Adam has grown weary with the world, having lived in it for too long and is disenchanted with the manner in which his current station in Detroit is moving: he request Ian to create a bullet with a hard wooden nose that he plans to use as a suicide tool. Eve (Tilda Swinton, always excellent) lives in Tangiers, friends with Marlowe (John Hurt), and is concerned about Adam's countenance as viewed on Skype. She flies to Detroit to comfort her long lasting lover offering O Negative blood Popsicles and other tidbits to brighten his life. Adam and Eve no longer gain their life source from living individuals but from blood taken form the blood bank in the hospital - with the kind assistance of Dr. Watson (Jeffrey Wright). All seems to be progressing smoothly until Eve's sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) moves in and all hell breaks loose.

This is a genre film and will likely satisfy vampire story fans. The film is well photographed and maintains its creepy premise to the end. There is some witty writing about art, science, and love and were it not for the presence of this specific cast the chief complaint would be ennui.

6423668,4,B00KE7PC66,"Let me preface my review by saying this film won't appeal to a huge audience. In fact I resisted seeing because the premise didn't appeal to me at all. I ordered it from redbox on a free rental and ended up keeping it three extra days because every time I watched it, I caught another dry humor joke, or noticed another tiny nuance to the film. The plot doesn't progress much, but it gives an interesting snapshot into the decay of Detroit, and the Tangier shots are gorgeous. Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton are fantastic as well. Tom especially is great as Adam, as its a character that is so out of his normal range of roles. He's almost unrecognizable, until a slight flash of eyes or smile reminds you that it really is the guy who plays Loki behind the dead eyes and somber attitude.

My only wish is that they had expanded the character of Ian (Anton Yelchin) who is massively underrated in this film.  I believe the blu-ray has some extended and deleted scenes that help flesh out the story even more.",1419811200,,1010,4.454054054054054

The only reason for considering 4 stars is because I found the ending to be somewhat less than satisfying, coming in the wake of an otherwise absolutely awesome ""vampire"" movie. But ultimately I decided to go with the top rating - not just for production values and great performances, but for the mood this film creates as it draws the viewer into its dark and thoughtful world.

Unlike a typical gore-fest vampire films, this movie takes a more philosophical look at these beings of the night, focusing on the frustrations and tribulations that come with a very long life.  I particularly appreciated the subtle references to the historical characters some of these vampires have been, and how they find themselves as relics of the past in a modern world.

Tilda Swinton is her usual phenomenal self, and her role here reminded me of the first film in which I ever saw her -  ORLANDO.  All of the acting in ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE is top notch, the sets evoke a feeling of stale dust and obsolete toys... all in all, this film explores what vampire movies all too often fail to grasp: with immortality comes great responsibility and a LOT of painful memories.

6423719,5,B00KE7PC66,"People will very likely fall into two very distinct camps on this movie: you'll either love it or find it tedious.  I am most definitely in the former camp.

I saw this when it came out in theaters and was mesmerized by it from beginning to end; and it lost none of its magic on a second viewing on DVD.  If you like only action and thrills, this is definitely NOT the vampire for you.  On the other hand, if you appreciate mood, subtlety and a film that makes you think, one which creates its own world and its own very distinct vision within the vampire genre, you will probably be as captivated as I was by Jarmusch's remarkable film.  Tilda Swinton was born for this role, by the way... and Tom Hiddleston perfectly complements her as her brooding, cynical, musical genius of a husband.

For anyone who appreciates the deeper themes in vampire mythology - those moving slowly and dangerously beneath the surface, removed from cheesy horror depictions and cheap thrills - this film is a quiet feast.  Immortality, corruption of the senses, a lurking sexuality... and devotion to the beauty of life.  Jarmusch's vampires, Adam and Eve, have adapted to the 21st century and shed their medieval predatory habits (at least until forced to return to them at the end).  They live, as does the film, entirely in the Night, and the dark mood created by the film is superbly affecting.

And the movie is very funny at points, all the more so because of the understated nature of the humor.  When Eve's annoying and irresponsible younger sister (played very well by Mia Wasikowska) ""drinks"" Adam's mortal friend and then complains she feels sick, Eve snaps back, ""Well what did you expect?  He's from the f**king music industry!""

Ultimately, this is a romance, albeit a very non-traditional one; and Swinton and Tom Hiddleston play it so very subtly, yet their ancient bond is completely authentic.  Beautifully acted, edited and directed.

As I said, either you'll be bored by this or you'll surrender to the dream that is, for me, this wonderful piece of movie-making, a refreshingly original new take on a very old theme.",1416268800,4,2118,4.748633879781421
6423720,2,B00KE7PC66,"Nine Things About the Movie ""Only Lovers Left Alive""

1. This movie was written and directed by Jim Jarmusch. When you see Jarmusch's name on a film, you know right away that nothing will ever happen in it.

2. This movie is about two vampires that wander around, drive around, stare at things, talk, and do nothing. Random things slowly happen. And then the movie ends.

3. It's almost worth watching just to see the performances of Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston, the two ancient emo hipster vampires that are trying not to get bored with life. Or death, whatever.

4. Hiddleston plays Adam, a semi-suicidal musician who hates humans, so he lives in Detroit and releases music anonymously. Swinton plays Eve, who lives in Tangier, and finds joy in reading books and dancing. Together, they apparently knew every famous artistic person in Western history.

5. There is a weird little subplot about the Christopher Marlowe/William Shakespeare conspiracy.

6. There's also a weird recurring conversation about quantum theory, as well as Nikola Tesla. This just shows how embarrassingly little Jarmusch knows about science.

7. Visually, the movie is lush and sumptuous; it showcases the beauty of decay and the decay of beauty. Sonically, the movie is also luxuriously grungy. The soundtrack is a perfect match for the visual style.

8. Jarmusch almost seems to be making a point about humanity's self-destructive nature, or maybe the inevitable disintegration of everything. But Jarmusch fans don't need to worry; he stops himself from actually saying anything deep.

9. Jarmusch movies always have a tone that is more important than things like plot or character development. If you can get into that groove, then his movies are enjoyable. But you can't appreciate his vibe, then his movies swing from boring to annoying. This is possibly Jarmusch's best film - or his least annoying one, depending on your perspective.",1416268800,5,1922,5.095541401273885

6423733,4,B00KE7PC66,"This is a very difficult movie to review simply because it won't appeal to a very broad group of people. My opinion is that it is a love story that has spanned ages between 2 very intellectual and jaded vampires. They gave up attacking humans centuries ago. tom Hiddleston is the brooding one who needs Tilda Swinton to come and see him after decades. He Creates music. When Tilda's younger vampire sister shows up she causes trouble. The very understated performances of Tom and Tilda are so beautiful and touching. Anton Yelchin is superb as Tom's go to human for things he needs. (he doesn't know he's a vamp) The word exquisite comes to mind. Now for the caution, it isn't like any vamp movie you have ever seen. it is deliberately slow and plodding. it isn't a ""Dracula"" type or a ""Twilight"" type...it is very different.

and I never do this, and never will again.  I let someone I know
who didn't like this film and called it utterly pretentious influence
my thinking far too much.  This is never a good thing.  Let THEM
think it's a bad and pretentious film if they think that.  I didn't.

I honestly LOVED Only Lovers Left Alive and, even with its flaws and all,
I roll with Jim Jarmusch, and I generally love almost all of his
previous films (if not every single one), like the crew in Michael Mann's HEAT
roll with Bobby DeNiro, ok?  I roll with you, Jim. You make 'em and I'll keep
seeing 'em.  Even if Dead Man didn't knock me out.  Even if Broken Flowers
I thought was merely good but not great.  Who cares. And who cares what I think,
really, anyway?  I'm a professional published author/critic/essayist, and I'm
saying that.  Who cares. Go rent or buy the film and see if you like it for yourself.
Don't just go by what the idjits on Amazon or the World Wide Webhead say.
Even me. But if you like my review, great for you.

This is a great film, it's not the typical hackneyed modern gorey stupid teenage-marketed
or cliched vampire epic, not even close.  I enjoyed the heck out of this
film and that's all I really have to say about it.  A lot of people
think Citizen Kane is garbage. Who cares? Who cares what other people
think?  One thing they forgot to teach even me in the pathetic excuse
for a ""film school"" I attended (albeit briefly) was that opinions are
like.......etc., but meanwhile most of those people wouldn't have known
a good film if it bit 'em on the behind.

Most ""vampire"" and even most new horror films per se are just pure
garbage.  They're not worth a second of your time.  On the main.
Only Lovers Left Alive is an attempt to render more than just a
""vampire or horror"" film.  It reaches beyond that and attempts to,
with subtlety and humor, be something a bit more than that. If, in some
aspects, it fails at that, then so be it, but I sat there for the 2 hrs.
plus and I never once wanted to hit eject, or felt bored.  But that's just me.
It is definitely more about the characters, love story, ennui, romanticism,
existentialism, and atmosphere than plot.  If it has flaws, then it has
those flaws.  Especially if you're expecting Coppola's Bram Stoker's Dracula
or Twilight or whatever.  You aren't gonna find that type of film here.

I roll with you, Mr. Jarmusch.  You took a chance. Most of these jokers never take
chances anymore.  I don't like Jack White at all, Jim, but otherwise, I was ga-ga on this
dark yet weirdly charming film like a bat on a belfry.",1414972800,,2647,4.340122199592668

6423781,3,B00KE7PC66,"With this film I have officially popped my Jim Jarmusch cherry, to use a slightly vulgar euphemism. Other than my general awareness of Jarmusch as a luminary in the indie film world, I wasn't sure what to expect. Now having seen this, I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. While not as fast-paced and narrative-driven as most of the movies that I'm usually drawn to, it had a laconic and meandering quality that allowed me to immerse myself in the world it created. It was laconic, meandering, esoteric, sensual and a whole other host of adjectives I could use. The cinematography was beautiful; the music was ethereal and trance-like; the dialogue was deep, erudite and offered insight on a variety of subjects.

 At this point, I suppose I could describe the a plot a little, but it wouldn't really do the film any justice since it was a lot more than a mere story. The two central characters, Adam and Eve (Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton), are two vampires who have been around for centuries. Eve lives a simple life in Tangiers with her friend Marlowe (John Hurt), while Adam is living the life of a hermit in Detroit and does his best to stay away from the ""zombies"" (what he calls regular people). He also composes music and collects rare instruments, which he obtains with the help of Ian (Anton Yelchin). The basic portrayal of vampires in this film is not unlike what most people would consider a ""hipster."" In particular, Adam has a preference for older, finer things rather than newfangled technology, an analog person in an increasingly digital world. In a way, despite being a vampire he is probably more in touch with humanity than we are, and since he's essentially ageless he has a perspective that humans will never have. This, in my opinion, is the most important and worthy observation in the entire film, that we as a species should take the time to slow down and enjoy the finer things in life instead of being ""go, go, go"" all the time. In her small but important role as Eve's sister Ava, Mia Wasikowska gives an embodiment of this tendency. In general, the characters were well-developed and the acting was excellent

 Still, the film is not without flaws. For one, despite all the interesting observations, a lot of them felt overcooked and obvious, especially when coming from the mouths of beings that were centuries old. I also wasn't too enamored of the glacial pacing. Granted, the long takes did allow me to fully take in the beautiful sounds and sights, but it still could have been a little slimmer. Also, while not necessarily a negative, the opening sequence made me really dizzy and I didn't exactly recover from it during the course of the film. Overall, I did enjoy the film, if more so on an aesthetic level than any social or cultural commentary. This film is definitely not for everyone. People who like their movies to have more punch or pizzazz, or be more narrative-driven, might find this to be a little boring. But for what it's worth, I feel like this was time and money well-spent.",1414281600,3,3035,4.677902621722846
6423782,5,B00KE7PC66,"Exquisite. LOVED it. The perfect dark, moody, intellectual, artistic film for introverts like me. I absolutely HATED Ava; typical little sanguine extrovert shows up with ""Pay attention to me! Play with me! Let's go out! You're boring! Me, me, me!"" I was 100% with Adam. John Hurt as Christopher Marlowe? Love that.

Detroit by night...is it really like that now?! Fascinating. So glad I don't live there anymore. The lights were still on when I left in the 80s. The director manages to make post-apocalyptic look romantic. Definitely brooding.

Jarmusch uses the immortal character of the vampire to voice his appreciation for some of history's most significant cultural contributors by playing out the fantasy of actually having met them. At the same time, he uses the main character to articulate his disgust with modern society's lack of appreciation for the art, music, and literature that has shaped history.

6423815,5,B00KE7PC66,"This film is not for everyone. Jim Jarmusch has a particular style that I admit would not appeal to me if it weren't for a couple of factors. First, I love Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton. And, I love vampire stories.

OLLA is a slow film, with few characters and little action, about a centuries long love affair.  Adam and Eve are vampires; she much older than he.  And though they spend time, even years, apart they are still connected and in love. When Adam sinks into depression over what the zombies (humans) have done to the world, Eve comes to him to help him persevere.

The vampire aspect of the film is subtle. The need for blood and avoiding the sun are the most blatant tropes, but they aren't thrown in your face. And Jarmusch has added his own touches, like the gloves and susceptibility to tainted blood. There is no obvious plot. What is at the forefront of the film is the romance. What would it be like to live ""forever"" and how would a marriage sustain across so much time?  Hiddleston and Swinton are perfectly cast.  She is ethereal here and I think she carries the film.  He is a perfect contrast to her light and optimism and his dour character provides most of the film's humor. Yes, the film has humor and can be very funny.  The other actors, particularly John Hurt, are a great supporting cast but the film is really about Adam and Eve.

Overall, if you have the patience, or are fan of art-house type film-making, then OLLA is well worth seeing. And vampire fans should definitely see this unique but still familiar take on bloodsuckers.  Highly recommended.

A note about the bluray: there are some nice extras on here, which is getting rare for films that weren't blockbusters. The deleted and extended scenes are excellent (and at least a couple should have stayed in the film, IMO) plus there's three interviews with the cast, a short featurette and trailers.",1413504000,5,1893,4.58753709198813
6423816,5,B00KE7PC66,"This movie gave me such an eerie feeling. It feels like death personified. At it's soul, it's a ghost story, and they are unlike anything you've ever seen before.

Thematically, the premise that the vampires are in the world, not of it, is a common one for vampire movies, but here it's taken to it's ultimate extreme. Adam in particular, seems determined to have no impact, leave no trail, to simply float above it all surrounded by the detritus of the world in a kind of thrift store fortress. He expresses despair because of the damage the human zombies are doing to the planet, but his despair feels remote, and like a ghost, he can only observe the world. Adam interacts with only two zombies, the one who feeds his addiction to musical instruments, and the one who provides his sustenance. You get the feeling he'd really rather not know either.

Eve, by contrast, moves gracefully among the humans, aloof but unafraid. She travels, frequents a human coffee shop, and seems, if not at home in a live music venue, at least she gets a kick out of people watching. The scene where they are at a club wearing sunglasses at night is priceless, and shows their otherness in a vaguely amusing way, but this movie inspires no strong emotions. They seem ageless and benign as they drift, and we are fascinated, but we are not afraid -- at least, not until the very end.

The only sign of life in Adam is his music, and it's throbbing, erotic music that sounds like blood moving through veins. It's strangely discordant, and like the junk he collects, it forms a wall around him. He doesn't want anyone to hear it, though he makes an exception for Eve. She fits him like a puzzle piece, and is the only thing in his life to rouse him from his self inflicted paralysis. Still, it's easy to see why he can't have her around all the time. She brings too much life into his death, and he's clearly uncomfortable with people touching his stuff. Adam tries hard not to exist, but is unable to end his existence.

I thought there were some interesting clues in the extra scenes that didn't make the final cut. One shows Adam and Eve arriving at her place in Tangiers only to discover that another family had moved in while Eve was away. She and Adam just stand there blankly and watch the family gather up their possessions and vacate the room. It's weird and in keeping with the rest of the film. The people aren't real to them. They're just there, and then they are gone. It feels as though Adam and Eve are ghosts, and life leaves the little room when they walk into it.

But it's in the final few frames that we see them, really see them, for the aliens they are. It is a stunning reveal, and we realize, at last, that they are not benign.

6423819,4,B00KE7PC66,"One of the most baffling developments in recent years is the complete obsession that the world in general has undergone with regards to vampires.  I remember when they popped up every now and again in some cult classic not many people even bothered to see.  Now, every movie has them.  Whole franchises are built around them.  Every director wants to play with them.  Teenagers want to look like them.  Tweens swear undying devotion to them.

They make me sick.

In fact, there is no greater cinematic turn off to me than the presence of a vampire, for at this point Im burnt out, and the funny thing is that I haven't watched any of those Twilight movies so I really have no reason to be burnt out.  Im just sick and tired of hearing about them.

Despite all of that, I have to admit that Only Lovers Left Alive certainly intrigued me.  Tilda Swinton always peaks my interest, for her ability to float from quality project and interesting character to completely diverse yet equally interesting character in yet another quality project is just remarkable.  She gets it, and so whenever I see her name pop up on a marquee (do they even have those anymore?) Im sold.

A.I.S.

Swinton, musicians, vampires, my recent interest in Hiddelston, the fact that Jarmusch is directing this, and hes one of those directors with distinct vision; all of these things added up to the fact that I was ultimately going to see this and most likely embrace it.  Only Lovers Left Alive certainly has vision, or at least a visual flare, but for me there was something lacking, something missing from the finished product.  It spoke with a clear tone, a languid and inviting tone, and it possessed a real electric presence, but when the dust cleared and the film ended, the themes of loneliness and undying love feel underdeveloped, malnourished almost.  The abrupt ending felt slightly out of place and somewhat tacked on, and yet Im at a loss for how it could have ended differently.  It just left me a tad cold.

That said, the story told of married vampires living separate eternities is extremely intriguing and definitely demands to be contemplated, frame for frame, and the compelling performances that circulate each scene build for a fulfilled ensemble.  Hiddelston and Swinton complement each other well, portraying a pair that is suited for each other despite their obvious differences.  Aptly named Adam and Eve, these lovers are drawn to each others souls despite their differing world observations, and the performances by Swinton and Hiddleston bring these characters to life.  For me though, the film belongs to Mia Wasikowska, who shows a side of herself I have yet to see.  Her delicious line readings and slinky body language fill the frame and demand our attention.  The film takes on a different life, a fuller, richer identity when shes on screen, that the audience can feel the weight of her departure too strongly.  When shes gone (far too soon, I might add), we mourn.

For me, the film doesnt quite recover from her absence, even though it has a lot more to say and her character really isn't an important factor into the progression of this story.

This is one of those instances where the tone is so effective and yet the overall finished product suffers from complete reliance on that tone and underdeveloped themes unable to back up the said tone.  It just feels rather hallow when its over, and for a film this drenched in atmosphere and intent, I expected to feel something stronger before the credits began to role.",1413331200,,3527,4.766062602965404

6423842,3,B00KE7PC66,"I went into this as someone else's pick for a movie night.

It came with both high interest and high recommendations from everyone - but, no one who had recommended it had seen it, although everyone who recommended it said someone had recommended it to them, so I must assume they had seen it and liked it enough to tell someone else - unless ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE is something like a virus people catch and pass on knowing nothing of how they caught it themselves - and that actually works for this film: if you treat it as the flu - it functions, but try to take it in the frame of a movie with a beginning, middle and end and it fails.

It terms of plot, storytelling, engagement, pacing, timing, conflict and resolution - it fails.  It terms of movement, explanation, direction or even entertainment - it fails.  But, outside the format of a film, it succeeds very well - this is film you cannot look at head on, it all works in periphery, at odd angles and in the margins.  It's beautiful to look at much like a Dutch masters painting but you should go into it knowing the picture is only solid because of the frame surrounding it.  Jarmusch has presented to us here a yard sale of treasures - everywhere we look we see something priceless and precious spanning all the four elements and it's treated both as rubbish and as court to eternals who can't seem to live, much less let themselves die.

The focus of the film seems pretty simple: life is worth living even when you're dead, or to live on at the cost of other lives (how capitalist - and that's not so off the cuff as you may think, money plays a role here).  Basic, short and to the point vampire lore, although the word vampire is never mentioned - we can assume they are the same: although the do not glitter, climb trees in misty forests, fight with werewolves over the lukewarm obsessive love of tragic girls with poor poetry skills and glum internal monologues - no, instead they live apart, more fearful of us than we of them.

Tom Hiddleston's Adam is afflicted by the cancer of nostalgia, while Tilda Swinton's Eve is a bold font in a lusty, often comedic novel, which explains why John Hurt's Christopher Marlow is her closest ally with the wryest of comments and most unsettled ending of the three.  And there is Eve's sister Ava, played by Mia Wasikowska, who, to me, Jarmusch uses to represent everything sick about the current age: rash actions, pointless choices while living and feeding off others for a moment of distraction to meditate the endless eternity.  It's all there, all high minded and pretty much left to be picked apart like Detroit (which, when you see the film you'll understand) - take it or leave it.

The film doesn't feel the need to go anywhere too fast or deal with anything too firmly or really examine anything about itself even at the very end - there are no major plot points that need to be summed up or story arcs that need to be resolved, it doesn't believe in plant and payoffs (what, if anything, becomes of the bullet is left a mystery) and it ends with a new beginning that lasts only a few frames that were more interesting to me than the whole movie before it...and, yet, I still cannot deny the film has its own dark charm as well a boring, pointless hubris - for fans of DEAD MAN and NIGHT ON EARTH, you'll have some understanding.

Overall, ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE is good because it doesn't bother with the norm and bad because it will not examine itself - I guess you could say the film is a corpse in need of an autopsy - stat!  Worth a look because it is beautiful, but it's a one way street when it comes to story - there is no turning back.",1413244800,2,3663,4.383480825958702

6423850,4,B00KE7PC66,"Vampires.  Everybody loves vampires in film.  The more exotic or unusual their circumstance, all the better.  American director Jim Jarmusch (""Broken Flowers""), who also provided the script, tells the story of 2 married vampires, some 4 or 5 centuries old who get back together after an ocean apart.

Adam (Tom Hiddleston) lives in a broken down house on the edges of downtown Detroit.  His only happiness these days is adding to his guitar collection and producing music that no one ever hears.  He contemplates suicide (wooden bullet, doncha' know) as he is fed up with humanity or as he calls them ""zombies.""  Eve (Tilda Swinton) lives in Algiers or Tangiers (not sure) in North Africa.  She gets a regular supply of blood (the good stuff) from her friend Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt), he the supposed ghost writer for Shakespeare.  Throughout the film Adam and Eve drop famous names of people they knew of helped throughout their centuries of existence.  Kind of fun.

Eve, recognizing Adam's melancholia travels to Detroit for a reunion.  Eve's ""sister"" Ava (Mia Wasikowska) drops by from L. A. much to the pair's chagrin.  Unlike the quiet couple, Ava like's to party, not to mention get fresh human blood, a trait frowned upon by our more mature couple.  The movie really looks good although it is almost exclusively shot at night, so watch it in a very dark room.  Fortunately, the Blu ray looks great.  Although I loved the atmosphere of the film, it has little more to appreciate.  Somewhat reminiscent of ""The Hunger"" from 1983, this film lacks the erotic firepower of that film.

The Blu ray transfer comes in 1080p and retains the original 1.85:1 aspect ratio.  As noted earlier, the night time settings require excellent black levels which are evident.  Colors are restricted to yellows and various shades of brown and grey.  Detail and contrast is excellent.  This is especially evident as Adam explores the latest guitars brought to him by his ""supplier"" (Anton Yelchin).  The lossless DTS HD Master Audio 5.1 track is excellent and will play great on your surround system.  This is especially noteworthy in the scene where everybody goes to an early morning club in Detroit.  Subtitles are available in French and English SDH.  Extras include a documentary about the Morocco production, some deleted and extended scenes, a trailer and a music video of Lebanese singer Yasmine Hamdal who also appears in the picture (she's great).

I felt it was kind of a waste of time, has nothing really happened besides them wandering through some streets. It needed some motive or historical line to make it more exciting. Let the right one in, is much more dramatic and spooky, and you felt the little girl had an old soul, a soul that lived for a long time, in this movie, they try to show that by how much they know about dead literary and scientific figures and such, but it doesnt get conveyed. The director is the only reason this didn't turn out to s***, but the characters are hardly memorable, despite Tilda always giving an A performance, she has nothing to work from, we don't hear of their real history prior to being vampires, nor what motivates them for life besides the arts which is great, but the movie doesnt go anywhere else.",1412380800,,1124,4.434782608695652

Only Lovers Left Alive immerses the viewer into the day to day life of two very old vampires. And day to day life it is. Very mundane, very slow pace. However, those used to the vampire genre know there's a special class of vampire films that do this. I think it echoes their immortality well. If you like dramas and culture, this is your film. If you'd prefer action or gore, this may not be your film.

Great music, audio, cinematography and ACTING. I love the two main characters. They're very well thought out for this character driven film. The actors (Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton) portray them well. Even the secondary actors preform well. There is some nudity and violence, but it is tastefully done.

Limited budget? The cast is small, the locations are few. The special effects are slim in number. However the audio quality makes you feel like the film had a larger budget. Unique musical score.

Only Lovers Left Alive has a very Art House feel to it. I enjoyed it. (Did Amazon finally list them under ""vampires"" subcategory""?)

Solid soundtrack as well, along the lines of Morphine and Nick Cave. While the premise is that these two are vampires who have seen so much of history, and met so many historical characters, I couldn't help seeing them, at times, as a couple of strung out junkies.

Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton  are excellent as the romantic, vampiric leads and one empathizes with their characters continual situation as artists in a world they see as dominated by zombies largely through the performance.  Mia Wasikowska's performance as the troublesome but youthful sister is also quite good, especially when compared with her more rigid performance in Stoker just prior.  There are odd spots in the film, and Jarmusch remains a director that has distinctively rough spots in his films (some of the stilted dialogue in Ghost Dog comes to mind).  The pacing mirrors the main characters reflections on art and perspective, but can be jarring or irking to those who want more traditional narrative film making.  Jarmusch's idiosyncratic tastes in pop culture and music do show up in the film, but this film does have a rich texture for most viewers to chew on once they adjust to this style of film making which is increasingly out of pace with even much ""indie"" system.",1409961600,,1097,4.9945054945054945

6424047,5,B00KE7PC66,"This film reflects a moodiness and a coolness that felt like a dream. There isn't much of a plot, it is more of a character study really, and while many might think ""boring,"" I was amazed at how the film never seemed to drag. It was like staring at a painting that never stopped opening itself to you or reading a poem where meaning was found in the simplest of words or listening to music.

Adam (Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton) have been alive so long, they've seen so much, they have a world-weariness that was rather fascinating to watch. (Obviously the casting here mattered.) There isn't a moment or shot that I wasn't looking at something -- whether it was Adam's crowded dilapidated music haven Detroit mansion, complete with torn wallpaper, old vinyl records, a cordless phone from the 1990s, and a TV from the 60s (not to mention the many old classic guitars), Tilda Swinton's elegant and simple clothing, her vast array of books, and her slow walk on the old stone streets of Tangiers where we first find her. Later, as these two drive down the streets of Detroit at night in a classic Jacquar, the camera pans a Detroit that is a ghost town of broken dreams. Looking at the vacant houses and streets, Eve mentions that Detroit will rise again one day as the southern cities burn. In cinematic terms, what is probably the most impressive part of this film was how Jim Jarmusch (the director) made these dilapidated streets of Detroit strangely beautiful. The kind of beauty that makes you want to cry.

The film reflects on art and addiction: music and literature in particular and, of course, the need for blood. Art and addiction have often gone hand in hand -- that insatiable need for pleasure and not being able to stop when we get our fill (something bad does happen here with Eve's sister but I will not say).

Tilda and Tom are so incredibly perfect together. You would swear they've known each other for centuries. They are the very definition of cool in a 50s beatnik cool kind of way with their Ray-bans, their leather jackets and gloves (to protect their hands which apparently are very sensitive), and their really strange hair (that somehow works).

This film is funny with droll comments from a very tired and rather annoyed Adam. To him, the world is full of ""zombies"" as Adam calls humans, believing they are philistines who abhor scientists; he also calls LA ""zombie central"" and believes fame is a bad thing. There is a Christopher Marlowe who is really Shakespeare, a conversation about how Byron was a bit of a jerk, and a wall of pics that included people like Twain, Poe, and Rodney Dangerfield. (Yes, Terri, you were right, Rodney was there.)

Adam and Eve (this was inspired by writings of Mark Twain, btw) are yin and yang -- light and dark. One sees hope and love, the other decay and foolishness. But, ultimately, they are survivors",1409443200,3,2879,4.648330058939096

There are only 5 main actors and precious few others w/speaking parts, but every one of them gives a superb performance.

Last night, I finally settled down to watch this little gem, titled ""Only Lovers Left Alive,"" a low-ish budget, French/German indie film starring Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddleston (Fujoshi, you may commence your obligatory fangirl screaming).  It supposedly made a big splash at the Cannes Film Festival last year, and got rave reviews.

Short story: I LOVED it!

But of course, you want to know what it's about.  It takes place in the present time, and begins with two separate lives: Adam (Hiddleston), a reclusive vampire musician and friend to a plethora of musicians and scientists throughout history,  who has become fed up with humanity and life in general,  who lives in a run-down house in an abandoned part of Detroit, obtaining obscure and retro technologies and valuable musical instruments through a rocker friend.  His wife, Eve (Swinton), a more gregarious and affable vampire, lives in Tangier, Morocco (The movie never does explain why they live separately, but they are still madly in love with each other), receiving her blood supply from another vampire friend.  When she fears that her husband is becoming suicidal, Eve travels to the States to visit, and bring some much - needed happiness into Adam's life.  But the return of Eve's sister, Ava (Mia Wasikowska), brings this idyllic time of theirs to a an inconvenient and abrupt end.

This movie may have been created on a relatively low budget, but it is obvious from the opening shots that not a thing has been wasted in its production.  The focus is kept tightly upon Adam and Eve but leaves room to display the dichotomy of their lives, from the exotic North African streets of Tangier, to the  claustrophobic, depressing, yet maddeningly cerebral surroundings of Adam's Detroit home.

Hiddleston and Swinton's performances however, are the real draw.  You can see the love that Adam and Eve have for each other in every single scene, to the point where nothing is wasted on them ... To say nothing that these are two lower A - list stars in small indie film.  Every moment with them positively sings!  There are other great supporting performances, such as Wasikowska's portrayal of the childish, bratty, gluttonous Ava, (seriously, her stupidity made me wonder how she even survived so long among humans) the focus of the film is kept so tightly upon Adam and Eve, that these other roles are unfortunately brief, and serve as background characters more than anything.

Yet the tight focus on the two protagonists is a good thing, because it balances out the admittedly slow pace of the movie, which may bother some with shorter attention spans.  Fortunately,  every scene is punctuated by riffs of atmospheric music, as well as a few smatterings of obscure  music tracks.  And each scene also holds some significance to the plot and building of the mythos.

Speaking of mythos, this subject is where the movie falters somewhat.  Perhaps it is time constraints, but some elements of vampire life did not seem very fleshed out.  Now, I fully admit that this could have been done for atmosphere,  to immerse the viewer fully in an unknown world, and to give merely a glimpse of vampire life, but to me it sometimes had the effect of being somewhat confusing and just a little bit frustrating.  (What were the gloves for?  Why disguise their eyes with sunglasses even in low - light areas?  Are these vampires the last of their kind, or are they not?  These were some of the questions that niggled at the back of my mind.)  Nevertheless, I loved the aspects of their mythos that were revealed, like how they safely procured blood, and their weakness to blood contaminants.  Despite its imbalances, the movie certainly creates an intriguing species of vampire.

In my opinion, this subdued, atmospheric film perhaps would have been better titled, ""For Better or For Worse,"" with its theme of the steadfastness of love in spite of the worst of circumstances.  One might think Adam and Eve's relationship seems a little too perfect, but that would be a misunderstanding of the context.  After all, after nearly two centuries of marriage, it stands to reason that they have managed to find ways to cope with and weather the various ups and downs, even after the violent, unpleasant, and just plain sad shakeup thst Ava's foolishness causes in their lives.  And being a hopeless romantic, I can appreciate that.  With little in the way of gore or violence to speak of, this movie may turn off more splatter-oriented  vampire movie aficionados, but neither is this some sappy teen romance with a vampire-esque coating, like Twilight.  This is a genuine love story.  Adam and Eve's love is genuine, and that applealed to me.  I believe another Amazon reviewer said it best:  It's a vampire romance for people who are sick of vampire romances.  As for myself, having a vampire milieu for the love storywas simply a tastier addition.  I loved this movie, and I think any vampire fans looking for something a little bit different would do well to give it a watch.",1408838400,2,5073,4.862470862470863

6424095,5,B00KE7PC66,"What do William Lawes, Smokey Robinson, Christopher Marlowe, and Dr Strangelove have in common? They are only a few of the many individuals alluded to in what is one of the most unique movies ever made. If you are familiar with the movies of Jim Jarmusch such as DEAD MAN, NIGHT ON EARTH, or MYSTERY TRAIN then you'll have some idea of what his take on a vampire picture might be but even if you do, you cannot imagine how rich and rewarding ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE can be. Of course the film is not for everyone especially those expecting a traditional vampire flick. The literary and artistic references as well as the languid pace and the total lack of action will leave many viewers (and reviewers) cold and bored to tears. This is not your father's vampire movie but a meditation on life, eternity, the undying beauty and power of art, and on man's many failings and the consequences thereof.

Imagine a vampire movie where the principal vampires are centuries old and are named Adam and Eve. From the posters it resembles THE HUNGER with Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie but it isn't. One of the characters is playwright Christopher Marlowe, also a vampire, who is 450 years old and spending his last days in Tangier. Adam & later Eve hang out in Detroit amidst the ruins of the once fine city and consume ""the good stuff"" - untainted blood from special containers - while coexisting with humans whom they refer to as ""zombies"". They possess a weltschmerz reminiscent of Klaus Kinski in NOSFERATU THE VAMPYRE and yet they prevail. Imagine all the things a pair of lovers would have seen come and go and come again since the world began. That's only part of ONLY LOVERS LEFT ALIVE. High minded and pretentious? To some it will seem so but others will find it deeply satisfying.

There's also transcendent performances from Tom Hiddleston & Tilda Swinton and a wonderful supporting role for John Hurt as Marlowe. The cinematography is hypnotic, the music appropriate, the writing sublime and the direction knowing and sensitive. There are several remarkable set pieces including the initial visit with Marlowe, evening rides in a white Jaguar through the ravaged areas of Detroit, and the havoc wreaked by Eve's little sister (Mia Wasikowska) when she comes to visit. This is such a complex and layered movie that it will take several viewings before it yields all its secrets. Too bad some of the extended and deleted scenes on the special features section weren't left in. If this sounds like something that you'd like to experience then go for it. Others who want a traditional or fashionable vampire picture need to look elsewhere. One of my Top 10 favorite movies of all time.",1408665600,5,2685,4.759656652360515

The chemistry between the 2 leads is so clear, you can't help but love them together.  It's quirky, and mellow, and completely worth the watch.  One of the aspects I really liked about the film is how these vampires have lived through centuries watching the world deteriorate watching the waters taint. Watching their one and only food source become tainted as well, with drugs, liquor and unclean living, knowing one day the human population will be so polluted, that even the vampires won't be able to survive.",1408665600,6,639,4.72972972972973
6424097,2,B00KE7PC66,"It looks nice, and the cast is great, but the screenplay is horrible. The characters drop many literary names, but there's no actual literary value to the screenplay. It's like hearing some new School students at a caf in the East Village read the names on their English 101 syllabus. Jarmusch names Shelley and Byron, but it doubtful whether he has ever actually READ Shelley or Byron. I myself have a Ph. D. in English. So, I have, in fact, read lots and lots of stuff by all those people.

I am not sure why vampires respond to drinking blood like the junkies in Trainspotting respond to a shot of heroin. isn't blood supposed to be like steak? It's food. It's not a drug.

Years ago, I lived in the East Village of NYC. Now, I work on Wall St and live on the west side of NYC. Seeing this film made me glad that I am no longer in the East Village, because it all seems vapidly pretentious. It's MOE important to know when a guitar was made than to be able to actually play it. It's MORE important to know the names of writers than to actually read anything they wrote.

Srlsy, if you remove all the writer's names (and musicians' names) from the script, there's no screenplay left. An episode of Law & Order has better dialogue.

I like Dead Man. I think it was an evocative and weird (and not successful attempt) to make a movie or real artistic value. IMO, Dead Man is much, much better than this movie. This movie is 5 steps below Dead Man.",1408579200,6,1447,4.3088235294117645

This movie was well worth waiting for, Tom showed yet another side of himself as the depressed and suicidal Adam. Tilda Swinton is his Eve and Mia Wasikowska is Eve's sister Ava who is nothing but a troublemaker. Eve finds out that Adam is depressed and so she goes through an ordeal to get to him and see what is wrong. She finds the wooden bullet and gun that he had intended to use. Adam is just disgruntled with the zombies aka the human race. He only wanted to hide and create, not to bother anyone. Ava rather mucks that up for him when she kills Adam's go-to guy and forces Adam and Eve to leave Detroit after disposing of the body.

The fact that they are vampires is really a vehicle to tell the story of Adam and Eve and their relationship. There are only four characters but with Hiddleston and Swinton you don't need anymore.

I see why both of them agreed to be in this though. It's part social commentary, part vampire movie, part love story and part something dark and delicious. I had some questions as to some of the customs of the vamps, how they interacted (the gloves and asking permission to remove them) that never really get answered although I think the ending sort of symbolizes what they mean. I'll have to ponder it more.

With the exception of an eventless drive through a Detroit neighborhood this movie could have easily been shot as a stage play. So slow through the first hour, you know nothing is going to happen. There isn't enough material to make more than a 15 minute short film.

6424106,3,B00KE7PC66,"Pity the vampire aesthete.  He or she has lived for centuries, contributing to and absorbing art, literature, music, and science while also enduring wars and cultural decay.  Such is the thrust of Only Lovers Left Alive, the new film by iconoclastic director Jim Jarmusch (Down by Law, Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai).  It is an atmospheric, slow-paced, and at times wryly amusing film in which to be a 21st-century member of the undead is to be a student of the hip and the sophisticated in an age capable of transforming the archway of a majestic 1920s theatre into the ceiling of an inglorious garage.

Ancient, but still chiseled and handsome, Adam lives in a largely abandoned area of Detroit in an old house crowded with guitars, records, and photographs of artistic and scientific luminaries.  He records atmospheric, dramatic guitar instrumentals halfway between shoegaze and Bauhaus and counts Lord Byron and Franz Schubert among his dead friends.  His even older wife, Eve, calls Tangier home.  She spends her nights speed-reading texts in any number of languages (there is a briefly glimpsed copy of Infinite Jest).  She receives top-notch blood from a close friend, centuries-old playwright Christopher Marlowe, while Adam secretly purchases his from a local hospital.  Sensing his worldview growing even more dire than usual, Eve flies to America to comfort Adam.

Portraying vampires as the ultimate melancholic hipsters, mourning for the world as it is and pining for a richer past, is at once a neat concept and a bit of a nonstarter.  Even if by design, the elegant malaise and the nonstop catch-the-reference namedropping grows rather enervating.  The point (we humans, or ""zombies"" as the vampires call us, need to remember how to embrace beauty and protect our world) is clear very early on, yet made again and again.  Call me a philistine, but this particular film could use a modest shot of earnest mystery and suspense, of grind-house vigor, and I suspect this could be done in such a way as to complement rather than overshadow or undermine its loftier ideas.  Its too-cool-for-school purity of purpose is both admirable and a defect.

Despite my grievances, however, it is not hard to spot the qualities of Only Lovers Left Alive.  It is definitely a beautiful film in its own nocturnal way:  poor Detroit, with its long line of empty and overgrown structures, is now an ideal location to convey an apocalypse in motion.  And the cast is very strong, both in regard to actual performance and, let's face it, in regard to magazine-ready posing.  Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton are a gorgeous, gaunt, and otherworldly pair in stylish sunglasses, and they generate a certain erotic and soulful energy, however wan.  And as Eve's volatile and more bloodthirsty sister visiting from the West Coast, Mia Wasikowska exits the film almost as soon as she enters it, but still tears into her few scenes and jolts the film into action or at least as close as it ever comes to a sense of consequence and propulsion.",1408320000,21,3033,4.944773175542406
6424107,4,B00KE7PC66,"Well, I'll be honest.  I bought the movie because it had Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton in it.  But at the same time, I was hoping for an alternative to the sparkly Twilight vampires that became so popular.

This is quite possibly the slowest movie I've ever seen in my life. It's less of a movie (and even less than that a vampire movie) and more of an art piece and a social diction.  I enjoyed it though, the same way I would enjoy a documentary on Detroit.  The vampire element is more of a background fact instead of the primary focus of the film.

Despite all of this, I did give it four stars for a few reasons.  1) The acting was spectacular.  I wouldn't expect anything less from Tom HIddleston and Tilda Swinton.  2) If you really do look at it as an art piece, it's perfect - the lighting, the music, the cinematic photography, even their wardrobe was spot on.  3) It is a highly unique and completely realistic way of portraying how a vampire would be living amongst us in the present day.  I found it entirely fascinating and realistic (almost to a fault). 4) The slow pace of the movie (more of a crawl) and subtext is kind of refreshing - I'm a little burnt out on the high action, less thought provoking movies that are so popular now (such as the Michael Bay movies).  This film is definitely thought provoking.

I didn't give it five stars because it really is sooooo slow (if you aren't prepared for it, you might fall asleep).

Other than that, the movie was great, Tom HIddleston and Tilda Swinton were great, and I don't regret buying this movie at all.  I fully enjoyed it.  But you should really think about whether or not you want to spend $14 on it.",1408320000,7,1677,4.344051446945338

Tilda and Tom and great together. It's wonderfully romantic, the dance scene is to die for. Car cruising like in high school, dialogue like shorthand with a soul mate. It won me over........

spunky sister

you may find the self loathing vampire played out an/or annoying

As you see the vampires, Adam and Eve -- played to perfection by Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton -- meander through this film you gain an appreciation for their aching love of music and art and one another... and you come to realize that these creatures, feral as they might be actually embody the history of mankind's existence,  and therefore need and deserve to be treasured and protected like the works of art they themselves admire so much.  So, when Adam and Eve have to revert to their more demonic selves in order to survive, you actually kind of cheer for them.  It would have been a great sadness, afterall, to see them lost to void simply because they were ""hungry"".

Some viewers might complain that the film is too ""slow"", but that's actually part of its beauty.  For the long-lived vampires, time creeps by... And here, where we ""zombies"" (as Adam calls us mortals) are allowed a glimpse into their private lives, minutes get suspended and are drawn out... If you want to live with the vampires, you have to learn to see things from their perspective... and the film gives us that.

As I said Hiddleston and Swinton are perfectly cast in their roles: adding grace and an otherworldly ethereal quality to the characters through the deep innate talent both actors hold.  Adam and Eve would have loved being friends with Tom and Tilda (and vice versa), I'm sure.

It's a must-see film.  Grab a copy of the DVD as soon as you can.",1403308800,17,1661,4.574324324324325
6424126,5,B00KE7PC66,"I loved this film. Probably cause I'm an Anne Rice vampire fan-girl. (Not Twilight.) If you're not a fan of vampires, slow drama, a lot of dialogue, great freaking rock music, and notice great actors like Tilda and Tom, then I suggest turning-tail and run from this film. But if you DO love sexy, mysterious, heartbreaking, cool, and an great story then this movie is a great film to watch. I can't wait till it comes out on Blu-ray. Jim J. is also a great director of indie films. I also loved his film ""Dead Man"" with Johnny Depp, also GREAT music.",1402876800,8,550,4.401960784313726
6424127,4,B00KE7PC66,"I fully expected not to like this film, which from many reviews sounded a bit arch and self-aware. Well, it is - but I was pleasantly surprised to find that in this case, self-awareness is part of the film's quirky charm. It was also this reviewer's first Jarmusch film, although familiar with his work by reputation.

This is a film that will appeal most to those tickled by underground communities and subterranean lives, and to the adult die-hard vampire/Euro-Goth crowd. Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton play Adam and Eve, aged vampires who have been married for centuries. Unlike the case of most old married couples, the bloom of romance still clings to this rose - perhaps because the couple have been wise enough to live far apart: she in Tangier, he in an old house in burned-out Detroit. Adam is a musician whose work has ranged from classical chamber music in the 19th century and, in the 20th century, to rock 'n' roll, where Adam has become an elusive musical legend rarely seen (for obvious reasons) by his devoted public.

As the film opens, Adam is going through a phase of existential angst and is considering sending a wooden bullet through his undead heart. Hiddleston's understated delivery saves Adam from coming across as petulant rather than despondent. Eve, by contrast, is a serene, rather Zen sort of vampire: a student of life in all forms, interested in all that the cosmos contains, from botany to astronomy. When Eve realizes how dispirited Adam is, she flies to Detroit to find out what's bothering him, and the film unfolds from there. Amusing cultural references include hints about the water shortage that climate change will bring about, Eve's closeness to Elizabethan writer, Christopher Marlowe (absently and tenderly played by John Hurt) who also lives in Tangier, is also a vampire and, as some have always suspected, the true author of Shakespeare's output. Additional environmental warnings are framed in the scarceness of healthy blood. Eve and Adam and Marlowe obtain theirs through hospital contacts - killing is a last resort. Jeffrey Wright puts in a brief and drily funny cameo as a pathologist in Detroit who keeps Adam stocked with quality O-Negative. The vampires all take their daily nourishment in delicate port glasses as they awaken at twilight, going into brief orgasmic comas as they do so. Adam's contempt for humans (whom he refers to as ""zombies"") for poisoning not only their water and food, but their own blood, is profound.

Shortly after Eve arrives in Detroit to cheer Adam, her mischievous sister, Ava, a reckless vampire some centuries younger than Adam and Eve, whom Eve hasn't seen in 87 years (Mia Wasikowska), shows up, [POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT FROM HERE TO END OF PARAPGRAH] and wreaks enough havoc in 24 hours to make it advisable for Adam to return to Tangier with Eve. However, things in Tangier have taken an alarming turn, as the two vampires find that formerly reliable hospital blood is now tainted and, therefore, lethal. As the film drifts languidly to its close, Adam and Eve are forced to contemplate returning to crasser modes of survival.

The film is quiet, slow, and beautifully photographed: it manages to turn the wreck of Detroit into a romantic setting, as Adam, in a vintage car, shows Eve the sights after dark, such as Detroit's stately old movie theater and the now defunct Packard factory. The soundtrack contains some of Jarmusch's own music.

The cast is enchanting. The pairing of the 50+ Swinton and the barely-over-30 Hiddleston as karmically matched lovers seems odd at first, but it makes sense as Eve's wiser and better regulated temperament is revealed. The two very attractive stars make it work effortlessly; there is no attempt to make Swinton ""look younger"", which is nice, and the pairing also demonstrates that fifty is not exactly crone territory - Swinton is still a beautiful woman. I was particularly taken with Swinton's subtle use of her eyes and head movements to suggest a creature who looks human but . . . isn't . . . quite. Both stars have beautiful voices to listen to and calibrated their performances perfectly to the pace and atmosphere of the film. Mia Wasikowska made the most of her brief role as Eve's decidedly less evolved young sister whose mischief sets the second half of the film in motion.

Apparently, you either fall immediately for the slow charm of ""Only Lovers Left Alive"", or you walk out fuming half an hour after it starts; the film doesn't seem to generate moderate responses. Not a great deal actually ""happens"" - if explosions, speed, and something happening every thirty seconds is your cup of tea, this film definitely won't be. This reviewer fell quickly under its spell, went to see it a second time, and will definitely purchase the DVD when it becomes available.",1402876800,75,4815,4.909090909090909
6424128,5,B00KE7PC66,"""Only Lovers Left Alive"" is a film that's both poetic and ironic - it's underground, languid and cool. If you're not on it's wavelength it may just seem slow, but if you relax and give yourself over to its we've-got-all-the-time-in-the-world pacing, you begin to enter its hypnotic stream, and then what a pleasure it becomes. The film deals with love and mortality - the passage of time, what's of value and lasts, and what is just of the moment. There also is a generational theme, embodied in the four vampire characters (relative to vampire years): childhood, adolescence, mature adult, and old age. Tilda Swinton and Tom Hiddelston, as Adam and Eve, make a lovely and deeply romantic vampire couple - one for whom endless time has not been wasted - they're philosophical, sophisticated and so much in love.  Tilda and Tom are perfection in these roles, their chemistry really holds the film together. John Hurt is the elder vampire mentor, Kit Marlowe, who has seen it all and has described it profoundly in the writings attributed to Shakespeare (a humorous dig at the old bard).  About half way in the film, Ava,  Eve's impulsive little vampire-sprite of a sister, enters the scene like a whirlwind out of L.A. (""Zombie Central"") and proceeds to upend Adam and Eve's gentle world. Mia Wasikowska has a hell of a good time playing Ava as a wild, touchy-feely little jungle cat, always hungry, looking for diversion and a means to quench her endless thirst. Where Adam and Eve contemplate eternity, art and science, and a loving connection, Ava demands to be fed and wants to party. Finally, Ava's dangerous urges create a crisis that forces the vampire couple to set another whole course. ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" is sensual and delicate with beautiful cinematography and a wonderfully evocative soundtrack. The film is refreshing and manages to be both contemplative and funny, a welcomed antidote to our ADHD society and all it's endless noise, ""full of sound and fury. Signifying nothing"".",1402704000,95,1998,4.940476190476191
6424129,5,B00KE7PC66,"The premise of this movie might make the more jaded moviegoer roll their eyes. Another story of thin, pale, artistic vampires angsting over their immortality?

But consider: Jim Jarmusch is the director, and it stars Tom Hiddleston and Tilda Swinton.

Yep. Even though the vampire craze burned itself out a year or two ago, ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" shows that it will never truly die. This is no teen romance starring gel-haired models -- this is a melancholy, bittersweet tale of love, blood and rock'n'roll, drifting in its own little moonlit world. Swinton and Hiddleston are truly sublime as longtime loves who draw strength from each other, but have trouble with the visiting relatives.

Adam (Hiddleston) is a standard vampire -- he's lived for many centuries, and now he's depressed by the way the world is turning out. He spends all his time hiding in a decrepit Detroit house, recording shoegazer music and uploading it anonymously onto the Internet. His only contact with the outside world is when he buys blood donations from a hospital, and when his ""zombie"" Ian (Anton Yelchin) brings him new vintage guitars.

So he pays Ian to make him a wooden bullet, planning to commit suicide by shooting himself in the heart. But his wife Eve (Swinton), who has been living in Tangiers for some years, senses his despair and decides to come visit him.

The two lovers reunite, and Eve manages to pull Adam from his stupor -- talking, dancing, chess, blood popsicles, lovemaking (implied) and late-night meanderings through the empty streets. But then Eve's sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska) makes herself at home in Adam's house, disrupting their lives with her reckless behavior. And when she does something unforgivable, she may force Adam and Eve to leave as well.

The vampires of ""Only Lovers Left Alive"" are very different from the sleek kind you find in most movies -- they have wild untamed hair, odd clothing, and live in shadowy houses cluttered with whatever they love. Mostly they drift around the night, having odd elliptical conversations that subtly hint at how different they from humans (""I just feel like all the sand is at the bottom of the hour glass or something"").

The first half of the movie is about Eve and Adam reconnecting, and how she gradually drags him out of his self-indulgent torpor. But the second half is sparked off by the presence of Ava -- she's pretty clearly going to cause problems right from the start, which sends the lovers spiraling off into the night.

I know, it sounds tedious... but the mixture of vampires, rock'n'roll and romance is strangely hypnotic. Jarmusch's direction is dreamlike and languid here, drifting over the vampire's faces as they lose themselves in their dances and blood ecstasy. Grittiness, decay, pale golden light in the streets. But he sharpens his focus in the latter half, as the lovers encounter a real problem that they have to deal with.

Also, Christopher Marlowe (as played by John Hurt) appears in this for... some reason. I think it's just to awkwardly air Jarmusch's anti-Stratfordian sentiments, but the significance of this character is... completely unknown.

It's hard to imagine two better actors for this movie than Swinton and Hiddleston. They LOOK like vampires -- tall, slender, androgynous and pale as the moon. Swinton plays Eve as a roaming bibliophile who soaks up knowledge like a sponge, delighting in the many things she's seen and done; Hiddleston's Adam is a moody, melancholy mess who hides away from the problems -- and the joys -- of life.  They beautifully exude the air of a couple who has been together literally for ages; after years apart, they reunite with a warmth devoid of awkwardness, as if Eve had only left for a weekend.

""Only Lovers Left Alive"" is a vampire romance for the people sick of vampire romances -- a languid, rock'n'roll-infused tale of joie-de-vivre lost and regained. A work of art, and worth it alone for the performances by Swinton and Hiddleston.",1402358400,242,3979,4.922388059701492
8658074,5,B00KE7PC66,"I originally wrote this for my blog, Indepedent Ethos. But I love this movie so much, I want to share my POV here: Only Lovers Left Alive, the long-awaited vampire drama by Jim Jarmusch, has to be one of the better date movies I've seen in a long time. There is something beautiful yet romantically slippery about the exquisitely matured bond between the vampire couple at the heart of the film. Adam (Tom Hiddleston) and Eve (Tilda Swinton) may be the first vampires of time immemorial. With so many centuries behind them, Jarmusch, who also wrote the script, presents this couple as the antithesis to the naive lovers in the Twilight Saga.

Stunningly stylish from beginning to end, Jarmusch treats the idea of long-surviving/suffering vampires in only the way he can, with brilliant wit and heartfelt respect. Beyond jokes like the characters' names, Jarmusch profoundly considers the effects of immortality on the minds of these creatures, both positively and negatively. Eve can speed read Infinite Jest, and thoughtful Adam tends to agree with Einsteins critique of quantum mechanics: ""Spooky Action At a Distance."" She lives more in the moment, taking up residence in an opium den in Tangiers and in the company of Christopher Marlowe (John Hurt) who apparently faked his death in 1593 to carry on living as a vampire (he's still bitter about Shakespeare). Meanwhile, Adam languishes in a big old house in the appropriately ghostly city of Detroit. He surrounds himself with dated electronics and uses rare instruments to compose experimental music on reel-to-reel tape to be released on limited edition 180 gram vinyl with no label. To stay in touch with Adam, Eve uses Facetime on her iPhone while Adam uses a low-resolution webcam attached to a PC tower.

As with any romance movies involving mature individuals, love can get complicated, even with this decidedly progressive couple. Over the ages, Adam and Eve have developed a becalmed relationship. They don't raise their voices at each other and despite the huge geographic gulf and differing lifestyles, their affection for one another does not waver. Still, a sort of tired undercurrent runs below the surface of their relationship despite a magnetism of shared experiences and an emotional investment that goes back centuries. They don't just have chemistry, they have a fusion as deep as old bones calcifying to become one. They are old souls incarnate.

Ultimately, Adam's loneliness becomes palatable to Eve from across the globe, and she books a red-eye to fly to Detroit. He's gone a tad mad and depressed, turning into a hoarder of sorts. Once at the cluttered mansion, Eve stumbles across a wooden bullet Adam had obtained from his human connection to the black market, Ian (Anton Yelchin). It upsets Eve with a quiet frustration, yet she handles it delicately, recognizing it as a call for attention more than a threat. The real kink comes in the unexpected arrival of Eve's younger sister Ava (Mia Wasikowska), who must have turned undead before her frontal lobe had fully developed. She's the most troublesome of the quartet. While the other vamps prefer anonymity, Ava's rather reckless. Wasikowska plays her with a wide-eyed precocious smile. She's like a mischievous elf hiding in the shadows ready to pounce for a prank, albeit a deadly kind. Her character adds a colorful bit of comic relief to the mostly purposely dour proceedings.

""only lovers left alive""Still, all of the film's characters are a delight, even if the film's plot is spare and ambling. As it is with most Jarmusch films, it's all about the dynamics between the characters, and he keeps the narrative focused on the nighttime activities of the vamps. The entire movie appropriately unfolds in the shadows, against a perpetual nocturnal backdrop. Cinematographer Yorick Le Saux, working with Jarmusch for the first time, delivers varying scenes using diverse degrees of focus and colored filters for different shades of atmosphere.

It's all about the vampires in Only Lovers Left Alive, and they are ironically soulful characters. Humanity has somehow lost touch with slowing down and savoring life, unlike these undead culture vultures. Jarmusch places humans in the periphery. Some human characters are only shadows in the distance. ""only lovers left alive""They roam the world on a diet of junk food and junk culture to the point that their blood has grown literally unpalatable to the vampires. Adam and Eve don't dare bite anyone's neck for fear of contamination by impure blood. Instead, they look for pure Type O-negative on the black market to sip out of sherry glasses. The vampires don't even refer to mortals as human. Instead, they call them ""zombies.""

The film's score and musical sequences deserve highlighting, beginning with the sumptuously absorbing score by lute player Jozef van Wissem backed by Jarmusch's very own band SQRL. The opening scene introducing us to the vampires is a brilliant montage featuring a perpetually rotating camera, turning the image around the screen at what seems to be 33 rpm--- the speed of a record player. The detailed art design, augmented with beguiling costumes, all twirling 'round can feel dizzying. The sensation is heightened further with the growling vocals of Cults' Madeline Follin covering Wanda Jackson's ""Funnel Of Love"" and the super-delayed echoing of a blues-infused electric guitar weaving around a stomping, slow beat, which is occasionally accented with a single ringing chime. It's a bit of sensory overload, but it captivates all the same. The sequence could work brilliantly as a music video alone.

It's not the only time music takes over for narrative of Only Lovers Left Alive in enchanting ways. When the vampires satisfy their thirsts, they act as if they are slipping away into an opiate high. The shallow focus of the scene allows their faces to drift away into blurs, fangs exposed, maws bloody and half-agape. The scene is scored with Wissem lazily dragging a melody across his multi-stringed instrument, varying each refrain with a high note and a low note. Below, a guitar squeals a low, wash of feedback. It's an enthralling moment, which delightfully recurs once more during the course of the film.

But the film is filled with many more delightful scenes, as it strides along at a relaxed pace that never tries the audience's patience, despite its two-hour-plus duration. Clearly, Jarmusch has spent a lot of time thinking about his version of the vampire. Even when they are troubled, like Adam, or deviant, like Ava, they remain interesting and even endearing. With Only Lovers Left Alive, Jarmusch has created a rich world that also provides a witty jab to the immature, pop-culture obsessed consumer who does not seem to know how to stop and savor the more complex arts. Yet, Jarmusch is not above offering a bit of self-deprecating critique back at his over-seriousness as channeled by these vampires. Despite its quirks, Only Lovers stands as one of his greatest and still entertaining personal statements in a long time.
