8269551,5,B0018CWW4Q,"OK, now I'm sure Amazon is losing my reviews! I already reviewed this one! I love the cool kid who thinks she's as smart as the adults and for the most part, she's right. Love the cool world where the bad guys are so inept they're safe. It just makes me hate the world were in even more, though.",1506124800,,295,4.016949152542373

8269554,3,B0018CWW4Q,Our granddaughter loved the first Roxy Hunter (Mystery of the Moody Ghost) which we got at a yard sale so we were pleased to see you had another she could watch.  This movie was not as much fun.  Too many adult problems slowed the storyline down.  Most kids aren't interested in who Roxy's mother is dating.  It was good clean fun in a mythically old fashioned movie town.  An easy way to while away a rainy afternoon.,1432166400,,418,4.376623376623376
8269555,5,B0018CWW4Q,"Fun and appropriate viewing!  I am a fan of this series directed by Eleanor Lindo, who has the ability as a director to capture the essence of a child's perspective .  These fun stories are brought to life without being silly of formulaic.  Great for pre-teen sleep-overs.",1420848000,,272,4.74468085106383

8269557,5,B0018CWW4Q,My 5 year old granddaughter loves all the Roxy Hunter movies.  My 8 year old granddaughter likes them okay.  They are not terribly obnoxious for adults and they seem okay for a kid to watch without sending out any bad messages.,1369267200,,227,4.512195121951219
8269558,4,B0018CWW4Q,I have not seen this item purchased as I sent it as a gift.  My sister said that it looked good and they kids liked it. Delivery was timely.,1329436800,,140,3.8275862068965516
8269559,3,B0018CWW4Q,"I rented this and watched it this afternoon with my seven year old daughter who's very into the mystery girl power type movies so I figured this would be right up her alley. While watching it I couldn't help but think that Roxy although very cute was completely obnoxious and a total brat. I guess they were going for the same old stuff you see in almost all of these movies where the girl star is an obnoxious brat which apparently these days is supposed to depict a strong girl. Well in my opinion a brat is a brat no matter how you look at it and by the way I'm not some old person either I'm a 29 year old Mom (well getting old ;))

Anyhow the story here was basically nonexistant at best. I kept waiting for something to happen and asking myself what the heck was going on. Can anyone tell me what the deal was with the kid who lived with them who missed his parents? Where where they and why was he there with them? Very, very confusing to say the least and weird too! Once you got to the actual meat of the story if you want to call it that it was very easy to figure out who did it, even my seven year old new right away.

When this movie was over I was suprised my daughter had made it to the end since I found it so boring but she suprised me by saying she liked it! So this is the reason I gave it three stars, I guess it did what it was supposed to for it's target audience, young girls. For me though there is much more entertaining stuff out there I'd rather have her watch. Right off hand I can think of the American girl movies. These show strong girls with good values without sending the message that you have to be a brat to be strong. Yes they are a bit sickening sweet but most of this genre is. So I guess go into this expecting an annoying title character and a very very thin storyline.",1236729600,,1810,4.03899721448468
