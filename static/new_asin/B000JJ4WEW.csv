2672557,5,B000JJ4WEW,"I have loved all three seasons of FMP, and even if this one seemed a little out of place in comparison to the first season, it still drove me to watch every episode in one day.  You meet all of the characters that we were introduced to once again, and we become exposed to some new characters who I must say show what they can do quite well.  ;)  The second season is practically ignored, yet Fumoffu can be interperated anywhere chronologically, as just great entertainment.  Anyways I was pleased with TSR, the action animation was beautifull, and it was a nice finishing touch to my FMP collection.",1215043200,2,601,4.537037037037037
2672558,5,B000JJ4WEW,"Full Metal Panic is one of my favorite anime series and this season is no different, its full of action, drama, humor, romance everything you could possibly want in an anime series. This season is a lot more serious than the last two, there is only one episode of humor and the rest is all drama but it will keep you strapped to your seat. This season features new characters such as Belfangan Clouseau aka Urzu-1 who pilots a sleek all black AS. Also features Teletha Testarossa's brother Leonard who is also a ""Whispered"". It may aonly have 13 episodes but it also conatains a prolougue episode 0 and an OVA based on Captain Testerossa (just for the fans of Tessa). This also has a bunch of extras that should keep u busy for a while. I suggest this to all anime fans, u will not be dissappointed....but first buy the first season because to fully appreciate this you're gonna have to love the characters from the beginning.",1214784000,,926,4.517857142857143
2672559,4,B000JJ4WEW,"I would have given this 5 stars if not for the advertisements that I'm forced to watch every single time I pop any disc into my player. They can't be skipped. They can't be fast-forwarded. I can't go to main menu directly. Each of the 4 discs contains about 5 minutes of advertisements (mainly Dragonball Z & Black Cat) that you must sit though before you're able to do anything else. I swear I'm never watching either Dragonball or Black Cat anime. Ever. To all marketing people out there: the surest way to ensure whatever it is you're marketing won't sell is to force the public to watch your ads before they're allowed to go on to the thing they actually want.

So that's all for my only gripe here. Other than that, this boxset really is superb. The packaging is well done, and comes with 4 booklets filled with FMP goodness, things every fan would love to know. Dialogue is in Japanese/English (selectable), with English subtitles.

The discs are also filled with extras, the best of which has got to be the bonus 30-minute OVA, ""A Relatively Leisurely Day in the Life of a Fleet Captain"", which can best be explained as fan-service for Tessa fans... but seriously, it's humourous in the vein of Fumoffu, and every FMP fan (even non-Tessa fans) would love it.

The anime itself is of course top-notch. It's FMP, after all. Seriously, if not for the compulsory ads that can't be avoided no matter what, this would be 5-stars. Possibly the only issue I had is the slight jump in continuity towards the last few episodes, but nothing serious that can't be explained away easily. Like Fumoffu, TSR was done by Kyoto Animation, and is not to be missed by any FMP fan.",1213920000,11,1668,4.5719063545150505

2672561,5,B000JJ4WEW,"Not much to say- much better than the first disc.  If you liked any other Full Metal Panic, you should like this one. Fantastic!",1172534400,,128,4.333333333333333
2672562,5,B000JJ4WEW,"To begin with, I will try to give a detailed and overall plot summary of the entire series -as much as it is possible- without giving to many spoilers away but SPOILERS WILL BE INCLUDED! Therefore, if you don't want to be given anything away to you, than do not read further.

First of all, as I described the first season this series have something for everyone and I do recommend them to anyone!

To the story:

First of all, the story starts where the first season ended (with a few `modifications' made). The anime begins with Mithril being involved in military attacks in the Baltic region while its leader has acquired advanced weaponry technology anti-ECS missile (missile able to detect systems with ECS invisibility). In order to protect hellicopters filled with refuges Sousuke must use the the Arbalest's Lambda Driver, which he still tries to learn how to control. Later on, the viewer will be introduced to the main villain of the series, Gates, who is a member of an organization called Amalgam and basically opposes Mithril and was the one which provided the leader of the Baltic nation with the advanced weaponry. We are also introduced to Xia Yu Fan and Xia Yu Lan, twin sisters who we later learn were raised by Gauron.

After a school side-story, the next mission takes us to Nanjiing, so that Mithri can safe hostages. There, Mao wil hide between the hostages by pretending she is one of them, will have to fight against Xia Yu Lan; Kurz Weber (who is piloting the only Zy-98 Shadow-type Arm Slave in the battle) will have to fight against Xia Yu Fan and Sousuke (who asked to take a M9 instead of Arbalest was denied because he is the only one who can operate the Arbalest and the Lambda Driver) will be left alone with the unreliable Lambda driver to deal with Gates, who is operating a Venom-type Arm Slave. During this battles we will also witness some betray going on (sorry guys, if I say more I will take the suspense away).

Yet, we should also not forget that a love-story between the two main protagonists is going on which will become apparent during Sousuke's constant absences from school and that Kaname becomes worried about him in many aspects; while Mao will start to worry about him as well. Sousuke, starts to reflect upon his own feelings about Kaname and would prefer to remain a student by her side instead of being a soldier etc. Furthermore, and going through various `misinterpretations' that Sousuke Sagara usually does, Kaname and him get closer and he realizes how much Kaname is depending on him. The specific episode ends when Sousuke (who is beginning to realize his feelings for Kaname) is ordered to withdraw from guarding Kaname immediately, with all guard duties being entrusted to another agent, codenamed ""Wraith.""

After being called back, Sousuke falls into a slight depression, not wanting to pilot the Arbalest and wishing he were back at Jindai High. We are introduced to the new Uruz-1, Lieutenant Belfangan Groseaux. He tests Sousuke's ability with the Arbalest, a test Sousuke fails miserably. Meanwhile Kaname is becoming increasingly suspicious that someone is following her. She discovers that Sousuke has left for good and realizes she is now completely alone. She decides to find out who is following her, and through a series of events discovers Wraith, who informs her that aside from himself, someone else seems to be following her. We discover this person is Xia Yu Lan, the younger twin. She shoots Wraith and then attacks Kaname. Kaname escapes, but is pursued and manages to surprise Yu Lan and shoot her with a Taser. After this she is met by Leonard Testarossa, Tessa's brother and a fellow Whispered. He is an agent of Amalgam and has orders to kill Yu Lan. He orders one of his bodyguards (a miniature AS unit) to kill her. When this is done he expresses that he seems to have fallen in love with Kaname and steals her first kiss, which infuriates her. In exchange for her forgiveness, Leonard allows her to take back Wraith who seems to still be alive.

To make the long story short the viewer will follow the Mithril team to another mission, this time in Hong Kong, in which power games and betrays will go on and someone is piloting an AS unit eqiuped with a Lamda Driver as well. In terms of `performance' Sousuke will hit rock bottom and fails completely because he cannot concentrate due to reoccurring thoughts of Kaname. These distraction eventually cause him to crash the vehicle he is driving. Mao tells him she won't work with him unless he can focus. Sousuke realizes he can't and abandons the mission. Meanwhile tensions between North and South China force Mithril to order an assault on the enemy AS before it is found. While they battle the AS, Sousuke wanders through Hong Kong, eventually meeting a Chinese Woman who resembles Chidori. He goes with her to her apartment, most likely to have sex, but due to her appearance thoughts of Chidori constantly fill his mind; (don't worry, He decides to leave) ending up wandering in the streets and meets an old enemy who amongst other things tells him that Kaname died. Sousuke kills him, this time for good. Meanwhile, Mithril is in great need of Sousuke and Tessa orders that Sousuke is been send the Arbalest so that he can rejoin the team and defeat the enemy; but, his will to fight is gone. Without Kaname he is lost.

As Sousuke tries to leave he is confronted with Kaname, who used Wraith to find Sousuke. After beating him up she tells him he needs to pilot the Arbalest and save everyone. Feeling renewed confidence at seeing Kaname alive Souske finally realizes that he is the only one who can pilot the Arbalest and works together with the Al to fully make use of the Lambda Driver.

The final episode, is basically the climax of the show and when the main villain is about to kill everyone Sousuke arrives just in time, makes full use of the Lamda Drive and saves everyone.

The Second Raid ends with Sousuke finally understanding what he wants to do with his life: Pilot the Arbalest for Mithril and attend school with Kaname. He works out a deal with Mithril that allows him to do just that. We are left with both Kaname and Sousuke having realized their feelings for each other, but neither of them being able to admit it.

Now, a few details about the series besides the story:

- It is 13 episodes long but fully pacted with action, the viewer will go through an emotional rolercoaster, has many twists, solid story and is by far the strongest season of all three.

- The animation is even upgraded when comparing it with the first season

- Music and dub are perfectly orchestrated

- As for the price, a logical concern to everyone, well, it is the typical as the usuall price of anime (the price spectrum usually varies between 23 - 29 dollars.)

To sum up, if you liked the first and second season, than this one is defenitely highly recommended for you.

I hope that I could help ^_^",1170720000,6,6948,4.663398692810458
2672563,5,B000JJ4WEW,"Last volume, a lot of Mithril agents bit the dust and now it's payback time as Mao and Kurz team up to hunt down and capture the traitor in their midst who is now hiding with a Mafia don in Italy. Sousuke has to break from his midterm exams and Chidori's constant castigations to rescue the two from the busted result. Another organization, named Amalgam, was behind the attacks in Volume 2 and the viewer already knows that its psychotic leader wants to get his hands on the Arbalest. But Mithril only finds out about Amalgam now and is quite divided on how to deal with the situation, especially because they don't know how or if more of it's own agents have switched sides. This is what happens when you buy loyalty with money, since in the end, Mithril is a mercenary group. One topic under discussion is taking Sousuke away from his guard duty of Chidori!

I felt this second volume was a little more balanced between its serious and comedic sides than the first installment even though it sometimes melded the comic absurd with brief moments of intense gore. Or maybe I'm just getting reused to the style of the first season. I love this show in all its incarnations so far but the frosting on the cake happens in the best 6 or 7 minutes of all the series when Chidori gives Sousuke a haircut after he almost kills a hairstylist at a fancy salon. It's just her and Sousuke alone, and there is such a gentleness as she touches his hair and you can tell he completely trusts her....who am I kidding? You can tell he completely loves her, and she loves him! It's scenes such as these that you hardly see in any form of film, be it live action or animated. Beautiful. This is a great show, but why only THREE episodes per disk now? Seems like a bit of money grubbing. You're paying around $7 per episode which is a bit steep. They should have released the series on 3 dvds instead of 4 to give the consumer more value for his money.",1169510400,2,1934,4.372222222222222

2672570,4,B000JJ4WEW,"The show seemed to have undergone an interesting transformation with this bundle.  The animation is different, almost a cross of Ghost in the Shell (I did hear they use some GITS backgrounds) and Eureka Seven's character drawing style.  I still liked the series and recommend it for those who like Full Metal Panic.  Don't expect the amazing storyline from the first series or the laughs of Fumofuu.",1262908800,,399,4.925373134328358
2672571,5,B000JJ4WEW,"I bought this along with the heavy metal collection and this package clearly outshone the other.  The presentation does not make the anime series, but boy does it help the experience!  I was pleased to find a pretty transparent plastic casing that creates the design you see on the display (if you pull it off the lettering and people are on the plastic) so very creative!  When you open it is filled with fan bonuses in the form of character sheets and detailed information about each character as it pertains to the series.  Also want to note that the CDs are in  a secure casing structure so bonus points.  Again (coming from a collector), if you tend to be heavy handed and aren't that big on keeping your DVDs in the best condition possible please be careful, but I definitely feel confident in the sturdiness of this overall package for the everyday buyer.

The DVD set upon review is a dream come true for me.  I am not a military buff but as an art student it was very inspiring and educational to watch footage used to give the artists and producers insight on how to design the anime and the exchanges between voice actors on the commentary segments.  I am not well versed in Japanese but when switching it back to subs the translation appears quite faithful to what I've seen pre-licensing and I would highly recommend this set to anyone who likes collecting!  Yes, I know the advertisements can be a bit taxing, but I am willing to let that slide because of the overall presentation and extras bundled with the series I have come to love. 5/5 All the way!",1256860800,,1567,4.5053003533568905

The stories not done, but sadly. Japanese public interest isn't here to continue the show and so this final season is a great way to bid farewell to those great characters.",1255651200,,448,4.463414634146342

It's amazing, has a lot of war, great action, and suspence. This is a great sequel to the Full Metal Panic Franchise. It looks so real with crystal clear picture and sound. A lot better than the DVDs.  I know that some people aren't satisfied about this set because the lack of animation from the opening. But I guarantee for those who have a 42"" LCD HDTV or bigger(no plasma) center ALL your color settings(leave it on 1080p). Then you'll get better HD quality while you're watching the series.

2672576,2,B000JJ4WEW,"While it still looks good (much better than the highly compressed DVDs that have tons of blocking artifacts), this show was originally animated in SD resolution and was upscaled for Blu-ray (it's still worth buying if you don't already have the DVDs or are bothered by their compression artifacts).

What's more, it was encoded at 1080p24 despite the opening animation being animated at 30 frames per second.  This means that while the main show animation is fine, the opening appears choppy on Blu-ray compared to the DVDs.  The movement is not as smooth since frames are missing.

Since 1080p30 is not supported by Blu-ray, the opening would need to be encoded at 1080i in order to show all 30 of the frames per second.  Since it's not possible to have the opening at 1080i and the rest of the show at 1080p, they could either encode all of the show at 1080i (like the Japanese Blu-ray release), or encode the show at 1080p while encoding the creditless opening in the extras at 1080i.  I would personally prefer the latter, but I would be satisfied with either solution.",1251072000,36,1073,4.711229946524064

2672579,5,B000JJ4WEW,"Since FMP! The Second Raid has been out for sometime now I am not going into the story in detail, but the Video/Audio transfer (Which is, for the most part why we invest in blu-ray).  As some would note, this is one of the most cleanest and slickest looking animes to date. Coming from Kyoto Animation I would expect no less as this new addition to FMP! on Blu-ray was inevitable due to its slick visuals and fantastic designs.  I should note that this is a triple dip for me. (Collected individually, then the Box Set, now this Blu-ray addition)

THE MOVIE ITSELF: (Maybe some spoilers)
If anyone has followed the first season to FMP! and even the addition FMP!Fumoffu you will know that this is the second season and a hell of a season it was.  Unlike the last season, the 2nd Raid is really straight forward and it leaves out the random filler type episodes.  This time around the story continues almost 3 months later and sorely focuses on Kaname and Sousuke's relationship.  To be short, in the amidst of all the craziness, they both realize how important they are to each other.  As I said, I will not go into much detail, this was a great season you should check it out if you have not already.

VIDEO: (Presented in an AVC-MPEG4/1.78:1/1080p)
I will be up front and say; ""You haven't seen FMP! The Second Raid in all it's glory, if you haven't seen it in Blu-ray!""
I have watched the DVD additions time and time again and this one is an eye opener the first time viewing it.  It is definitely more vibrant, sharp, and the lines are really clean; not just another plain upscale like some thought it would be.  The studio actually went in and remastered it for HD release and more importantly they removed a lot color banding.  Though I might add, it is present in some scenes but rarely apparent.  Just to check if my eyes were not lying to me, I went back to the DVD addition (Upscaled 1080p), and yes this is definitely a step up from that.

AUDIO: (Presented in 5.1 ENG/JP Dolby TrueHD) ^^b
Unlike the video presentation; the audio has been beefed up enormously.  Some of the key upgrades in audio are more rear surround use and a bombastic use of the LFE (sub).  What I appreciated the most was the liveliness that they gave the Arm Slaves; whether they were just walking or in the amidst of action, they definitely rocked the LFE thundering the house.  Good stuff, not audio demo worthy, but good stuff for an anime. It would remind you of the Cloverfield monster rampaging through the city.

EXTRAS:
Unfortunately they did not add anything that the DVD additions didn't have already.  All of the extras which included Episode 000 and the Bonus OVA (presented in HD as well) are all crammed into the second disk. I should note that you can view a short trailer of the Blu-ray addition of Burst Angel; if your are wondering how it would look that is.

In conclusion, if you are a video/audiophile like me and you love to watch your anime in a high fidelity or you just love FMP! that much; you definitely want to add this one to your collection.  This one is a nice addition to the Funimation Blu-ray venture.  Here's hoping for Season 1 and maybe Fumoffu for Blu-ray!

2672584,4,B000JJ4WEW,"In my opinion the mark of a solid piece of sequel anime is a show's ability to not only present new material but to also seamlessly intertwine it with the plot of the original. Enter Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid (TSR) from anime master workers, Funimation. This gorgeous 4-disc set represents the proper formula for improving upon the season before it (which just so happens to be the first of the series) without pulling the story off onto an unrelated tangent.

The Second Raid follows the exploits of mercenary soldier Sousuke Sagara who, right from the beginning, does an adequate job of fulfilling his undercover mission as a regular high school student. Unlike the first season, which focused more on the importance of female-lead character Kaname Chidori, this time the viewer is treated to a bit more sympathetic take on the almost child-like innocence of Sousuke. While their hot and cold romance still forms the backbone of the tale, there is no shortage of political motivation or interesting characters to accompany the action.

While Souske resumes his meteoric rise to the title of Sergeant for the paramilitary outfit called Mithril, the major struggle being presented finds Mithril locked in battle with the terrorist group Amalgam. In truth, and despite how well the good guys are presented here, it's tough not to find the bad guys terribly interesting. Among these is a lesbian pair of twin sister assassins, the enigmatic Leonard Testarossa (who just so happens to be the brother of Mithril's own cheery colonel, Teletha) and his extremely wicked robotic enforcers. Last but certainly not least is the lead villain Gates who, quite frankly, captures the concept of full ought insanity in animated form like something American animators can only dream of achieving through The Joker.

And since Full Metal Panic! initially hooked me with its near-flawless use of mecha, it's only proper that I take a moment to recognize the simple truth that TSR not only picks up where the first season left off, it may even supercede the robotic combat at times. Notable here is the ongoing struggle for Souske to make full use of the full abilities of his unit, the Arbalest, and its emotion controlled Lambda Driver. In my opinion the FMP series succeeds where other robot shows fail in both the mobility of the robots (called Arm Slaves or AS' for short) is in their sheer speed and maneuverability. Right from the beginning of the very first episode viewers are treated to an incredible display of AS stealth, speed, and power. It's cinematic showmanship in the purest form and enough to give even diehard anime fans the chills.

Although not entirely essential to the overall plot progression, I should mention that another Arm Slave, the M9 Falke, makes a few appearances that just dazzle with eerie coolness.

As impressive as the story itself is, it's only fair that I give Funimation credit where it's due in releasing a box set worthy of the material contained within. The set comes in a cell-inspired clear plastic slip-sleeve with a cardboard tri-fold disc sleeve (art work loaded to the hilt throughout). If that weren't enough, the set comes packed with four full color booklets just rife with beautiful artwork, facts, character profiles, and interviews.

The discs themselves contain no shortage of entertainment either. The complete 13-episode series is presented across four discs in uncut glory with dialog coming in the selectable form of English, Japanese or in original broadcast format with English subtitles. While the series itself technically consisted of 13 episodes, Funimation packed both a mini-bonus episode (complete with a scene that had this reviewer actually laughing out loud) and a conclusion OVA full-length episode as well. There is a 7-part featurette entirely in Japanese with English subtitles that does a few interesting things whether they were intentional or not. The first of which is that this section provides an unrivaled look at the Hong Kong lifestyle complete with unlimited comparisons to how life differs there from life in a typical US city. Next it paints the show's creative staff in an entirely different light. I'm guilty of stereotyping anime writers, producers, artists, and directors as moody, withdrawn and slightly disturbed individuals but nothing could be further from the truth with the down-to-earth team responsible for FMP. Finally, anime may be known for an unsurpassed level of detail but never is this reality made clearer than when the viewer is offered a chance to look at the actual Hong Kong locations that inspired the backgrounds of the show. It's downright mind-boggling and a testament to the amount of work that goes into putting a series like this together!

Additionally the set contains a comical little segment in which our creative team takes a trip to a Japanese Self-Defense Force expo for inspiration on the military equipment that appears throughout the series. There are
Japanese (English subtitled) commentary tracks across every single episode from several of the show's voice actors and finally the set offer textless versions of the show's theme songs.

Coming in at a total runtime of 320 minutes, this set is unrivaled in its bonus material and value for the money. The truth is that it is very difficult if not impossible to come away from this presentation without having taken something worth remembering. The anime itself is rich, deep, and oftentimes silly enough to warrant a chuckle but there's something here even for those who wouldn't consider themselves fans of the genre. The creative process and attention to detail is downright awe-inspiring.",1242259200,2,5664,5.089343379978471

2672586,5,B000JJ4WEW,"This is a really good dvd set. It has all the episodes, plus the halarious ova. Both japanese and english dubs, and for those who like english dubs, I took a look at this show's and it was pretty good, I'd still suggest to watch it japanese. I didn't really take a look at the special features in this collection other than the trailers, but there are quite a few listed. The biggest selling point for me was the booklets in this set. It comes with 4 booklets that contain a bunch of information on most all the characters, the story, and several other things. I found them to be fun to read through. It doesn't take up much shelf space, only the size of about 2 dvd cases. The case itself is pretty neat too. It's the only case I have like this where there is 2 dvd's in view but they're actually sitting on a flap that lifts to reveal the other 2. Hard to describe but interesting when you see it.

When it comes to the show itself, I really liked the first season because it had the story line, unlike fumoffu which was also great for a comedy, to it and I was wanting more after, so this series was perfect. It has a more serious story line to it, with the needed comedy as well. The show reveals more about the characters, and there is a nice little appearance from the stars of Deathnote. I think if you liked the first season, you'll love this one. I'd definetly recommend anyone to buy this.",1236470400,,1399,4.220149253731344
2672587,5,B000JJ4WEW,If you are a true anime fan this is a must see.  The graphics are awesome and the story is well acted with comic relief but still serious.  Funmofu is even better.

2672588,5,B000JJ4WEW,"The Second Raid took me by surprise on how well the main story line and mix storylines fit perfectly and ended in a good note. Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid is darker (Seriously), shows more action,cursing is somewhat common in the anime,shows you what extend the characters go through to get what they need. Since i was not expecting some of the things that then producers put in the third season, half the time my jaw dropped and i was shock on how the third season has a edger side to it.

Sum Of The Story (No Spoilers)
Sousuke Sagara has three jobs. Protecting Kaname Chiodri, learning and using the new A-S, and maintaining good grades at school. When all three comes to danger, Sousuke life takes a toll and he has a breakdown. Can Sousuke overcome the odds or taking orders from Mithril is too much for the teenage? Meanwhile at Mithril, Terrorist are attacking Hong Kong and a familiar face waits for them. which side would the war-student bodyguard will pick?

The only con about the anime is that their was two sisters naked and holding each other. Shocking i was hoping that they were not going to hope on the good foot and do the bad (I'm not going to details with that, think about) but they didn't. The fanservice is a little bit more than the first one so yes their is nudity.

The Box set is slimer than the first one so putting in small places is not a problem. It comes with four discs and booklets. If you forgot what happen in one episode or you want to look up who so and so is, The booklet offers it. It will show you their profile, the weapons, the A-S, and how the producers got the background for the anime. The bonus features are Trailers, Bonus OVA (Tessa own short story on how she got drunk and needs to find her teddy bear), Producers showing you modern day Hong Kong and how they use it in The Second Raid and Textless Songs (Opening and Ending Theme).

The anime is better and darker than the first. I would reccommend this to anyone who seen the first season and wants a more intense storyline and more action to it. The replay value is high, so what are you waiting for? Buy it!",1231286400,,2117,4.338383838383838
2672589,5,B000JJ4WEW,"If you love the origional series, you'll love this.
I already have the whole series on 4 separate dvds (via Hong kong ages ago).....& this is where the idiocy comes in:

I assumed more were comming out (like many other great series..GITS for example) to make up a 26 episode series again....I was indeed wrong. The Second Raid comprises of ONLY 13 episodes (no more have been produced).
Why oh why....I need more!!!

Anyhoos...as to this box set I am tempted to give it as a present...trouble is I really like it! The sliding box dvd set is very nice & it takes a second to realise how you open up the other to discs...quite 'trick'. It also comes with nice detailed booklets or 'Mithril Report'..s.

So if you like the first series this is a good buy (nicer than the individual DVD's)...Just remember it is 13 episodes ..not more.",1227916800,,831,4.526666666666666
2672590,4,B000JJ4WEW,"This is quite a remarkable follow up to the first season of Full Metal Panic - it takes the tone of the first season and brings it up a notch - meaning that the action is a little more intense, the story is a bit more complicated, the relationships are more strained, and the fan service is a little more...well... obvious.  Everything that I would expect from a sequel.  The animation is fluid and easy on the eye, the new characters are interesting and engaging while our old friends from the first season all make their appearances.

My only complaint (if you can call it that) is that because the story is more complex (with various story lines continuously interweaving throughout all the episodes much more than in the first series) there was much more to explain and explore and not enough time in all the episodes to develop all the new characters and storyline as I would have liked. This does not detract from the enjoyment of watching and it doesn't necessarily detract from the story itself either - but it definitely leaves you desperately waiting for a 3rd season to answer a lot of your unanswered questions.

The set itself is simple - the DVDs are kept together in a slim box set case.  I don't recall any amazing DVD inserts and the DVD extras are not really anything to get excited about - but for my purposes (which is just to watch enjoyable complete anime series on DVD) this is a perfect fit and I would not have purchased a different set.",1224201600,3,1462,4.50188679245283

2672592,5,B000JJ4WEW,"After finishing watching The Second Raid (TSR) around 20 minutes ago, I was left with a feeling of fulfilment anime rarely ever gives me these days. As an action series it's hard to fault: The action was enjoyable to watch, helped by the high production values, and it had a strong cast of characters that painted over the story simplicity. It did everything it needed to do right and ticked all my boxes, meeting my overly critical standards.

This wasn't the case with the original FMP series, though. Back when I watched that I was left a bit underwhelmed by an experience I'd expected to be a lot more enjoyable than it turned out to be. The constant switching between school comedy episodes and anti-terrorism/mecha action stories let it down, interrupting the flow and making it difficult to get into the serious episodes. And, with the quality of the serious story arcs and comedy varying from decent to very good, the quality of the content wasn't enough save a series suffering from an identity crisis. I gave it 7/10.

Thankfully, someone with a brain obviously decided it would be a better idea to separate the serious and comedy elements into two series, removing the problems caused by the conflicting genres. The comedy side of things got its very own series first in the way Fumoffu and, as you'd expect, lots of school insanity involving Sagara and Kaname followed. It worked out far better without any robot goings on getting in the way, helped by the comedy scenes being far more funny than most of those shown in the original series. I gave it 8/10, but I would've probably scored it higher if not for my sense of humour failure.

TSR, which came out after Fumoffu, did the reverse and focused on the anti-terrorism side. I wasn't really sure what to expect after ending up disappointed with the more serious sections of the original series, not even the high ratings making me confident. I only got around to watching it after I saw and won an auction for the art box + entire series on eBay.co.uk, the motivation not having been there when I had finished Fumoffu many months earlier. But, when I did finally get around to watching it, I found myself struggling to find faults, and even the faults I found were only relatively minor things such as the use of abbreviations without any explanations being given.

As you'd expect with TSR being an action series, the story wasn't memorable: The threat of civil war appears, Mythril send out Arm Slaves to intervene, the threat of war is averted and the cycle starts anew. Mixed in is an organization called Amalgam that creates wars to test out weapons and profit from doing so. None of it is hard to understand or what I'd consider to be memorable.

So, what made TSR better than most other action series? The characters. Since most watchers would've viewed the previous series before getting into this, most of the character introductions and basic development wasn't necessary, leaving more than enough time for the new characters to get introduced and allowing for the already established characters to get additional development. Talking of new additions, the new characters were pretty good, the insane new villain Gates and a pair of sexy Chinese twins being the best of the lot.

Unsurprisingly, The Sagara/Kaname relationship received the most time and, as a result, was the strongest non-action point of the series. I came to like/love/want to sex Kaname far more by the end, the determination and emotions shown by her raising my opinion of her even higher than it was prior to watching. Sagara, on the other hand, was more hit and miss: I hated him for a lengthy period of TSR for being a coward, but I did end up warming up to him towards the end; when the interaction between the two resumed. The one consistent thought that ran through my mind when watching Sagara was that without Kaname around him he's neither likeable nor very interesting...

Overall, I can't help but rate TSR highly. It successfully pleased someone hard to please, meaning it's a show that I'm sure the majority of anime fans out there that haven't got around to watching it yet would love to bits. Looking for a short and high quality action/mecha series? If so, this is for you.",1220140800,,4236,4.739484396200814

All of the characters return and so do the Arm Slaves. The AS's are even more awesome in TSR. The voice actors are all the same and the music is still great. My only complaint is that the ending leaves you hanging really bad. It pretty much ends with all sorts of bad guys ready to pounce and the team of the TDD ready to take them on. I loved this series but was very disappointed by the ending. Ive been waiting for them to end it for years, but no luck. I still have hope though.

8150894,4,B000JJ4WEW,"I watched this after watching the first series which I personally was a bit disappointed with. This series reloads to give you more of what you saw in the first series but this time the creators do a much better job of fleshing out the characters. Everything is just more polished, including the animation that was already excellent to begin with. You could watch the second raid without watching the first season but you'll be missing out a bit on the various relationships between many of the characters. Unlike some series though, you won't be totally lost.

I just wanted to do a quick review for those who have seen the first series and were also left feeling disappointed and wondering whether they should go for the second, I say yes. If you're just a casual fan of the anime genre, you can go ahead and skip the first season without missing out on too much.",1304121600,,865,4.544871794871795

8150896,5,B000JJ4WEW,"If you have seen the other 2 Full Metal Panic series, this one is required viewing. You will not be disappointed. This series goes back to the gritty action and drama seen in many portions of the 1st series. Most definitely the least humorous out of the three but that's what allows this one to shine through. Plus, we get to see the much more emotional Sousuke, rather than the socially inept and more laid back Sousuke in Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu. Anyway, the conversion to blu-ray makes the overall animation quality crisper and clearer and the colors are more vibrant. The sound quality is much richer and noticeably more dynamic. Definitely a much better way to enjoy this awesome series.

For people new to the Full Metal Panic universe, this one and the other 2 series are recommended if you: 1) enjoy mech battles and war/battle based stories, 2) enjoy ""tongue and cheek"" humor, 3) enjoy nice doses of action(explosions, gunfire, and etc), 4) like interesting and engaging storylines, and/or 5) like memorable characters and good character development. So basically, if you don't mind an anime that gives you everything from absolute seriousness to zany humor, and some of the stuff in between, you will probably enjoy Full Metal Panic! The Second Raid(and the other 2 shows).",1281571200,2,1285,4.894495412844036
