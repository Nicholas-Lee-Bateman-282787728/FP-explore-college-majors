8426552,2,B004E7NHS2,"PARADE is basically the presentation of a circus performance, in which artistes interact with the audience in a series of set pieces - juggling acts, tightrope walks, clowning, balloon fights, plus one or two routines in which Tati demonstrates his remarkable talent for mime.  The film's artificialities are evident: we see cardboard cutouts of members of the audience among live-action actors, while the performers sometimes talk to inanimate objects.  Tati's purpose, although not overtly stated, seems to be to show how life is like a circus, with all of us indulging in a series of ritualized actions which, although meaningful in themselves, can also be considered absurd.  This is definitely true of some of his set-pieces - for example the very funny routine where he imitates a boxer going into a championship bout.  However, a series of routines do not necessarily make for an entertaining film: some of the performances involving actors other than Tati are distinctly second-rate, while the audience - when Tati's camera shows them in close-up - sometimes look thoroughly bored with the proceedings, despite the enthusiastic applause on the soundtrack.  Judged by his previous oeuvre, PARADE is sadly a very second-rate piece: one feels sad that the great director could not have bowed out on a more positive note.",1389139200,2,1325,5.2018779342723
8426553,3,B004E7NHS2,"Jacques Tati's final film Parade takes the great comedian back to his music hall roots. In what appears as a presentation of a circus for Swedish television, Tati does much more. This is a highly experimental film that attempts to break down the walls between audience and performer to make the entire performance more democratic, a spectacle that everyone has the right to participate in.

The film also acts as swansong for Tati who is reduced to doing his music hall act some forty years after he started. Thus Tati ends his career the way he started it in front of an audience doing the mimes that made his career: the goalie, the fisherman, the horse and rider, the tennis player. Tati does not move as swiftly as he did earlier in his career but the act still works. There is a sadness over the whole thing: a great performer on the decline.

The BFI Edition that I viewed presents the program with limited subtitles. But as with all Tati films the subtitles are not really necessary. The picture is a little soft and fuzzy but this is likely due to the quality of the source materials. The program was made for Swedish television and was shot on mixed media sources. The only extra is a twenty minute interview with Tati shot in London in 1977.",1300752000,,1251,4.530973451327434
