7031435,1,B00UA00H1W,It's a documentary.,1431648000,13,19,5.666666666666667
7031436,1,B00UA00H1W,This is a horrible misrepresentation of what should have been a great scifi movie. The title and cover are misleading and the content would be better suited for a junior college geology supplement to a textbook rather than a commercial product created for entertainment. I hope that no one else waste good money on this movie.,1431648000,18,326,4.839285714285714

7031438,3,B00UA00H1W,"Don't be deluded (as I was); this is NOT a disaster movie as the title and cover art would lead you to believe.  It's a ""documentary"" about the possibility of an earthquake along the San Andreas fault and the damage it could do.  With no description provided by Amazon I had to judge by the cover, which proved to belie the contents.  If you are looking for a movie, skip this DVD.  If you want to spend fifty minutes on speculation of what might happen, this is for you.",1431648000,37,471,4.258426966292135

7031440,1,B00UA00H1W,"While the packaging and the label on the DVD shows it is about the San Andreas, playing of the DVD is actually about the Pacific Northwest fault and not what I was looking for.  Very surprised at this since this was a BBC product.  I had to return two different times so there is no mistake that the DVD was just mislabeled.",1449273600,,324,4.209677419354839
7031441,5,B00UA00H1W,I throughly enjoyed watching it. I'd recommend the blueray version. It was in no way a documentary but a lifelike scenario of what will happen. It's just a matter or when. I thought it was very good.,1446768000,,199,4.405405405405405

7031454,1,B00UA00H1W,"This was a disappointing documentary about the possibility of a colossal quake coming to California, specifically San Francisco and LA.  Instead
it deals mostly with Seattle and Vancouver!  Most people in the West are more concerned with LA  and SF because of their open exposure to the
Pacific.  Into in this 50 min doco is interesting but has nothing to do with what I wanted to see.  So boo hoo to this DVD which I got from Amazon.

7031486,2,B00UA00H1W,"As others have stated - this particular DVD doesn't really deliver on the promo hype presented on the DVD box cover.  Perhaps the biggest 'error' is the fact that the subject matter covered isn't really the San Andreas fault!  It would appear that the distributors have rushed this product out to take advantage of the release of the Hollywood blockbuster, of the same name, and have done the BBC a disservice in the process. The box cover art and promo write-up are both quite deceiving as they would lead one to believe that the contents might depict a story and visuals of a dramatic nature - showing simulated earthquake disaster effects.

In reality this is an  'interesting documentary' of a relatively mundane nature that 'speculates' on the effects of a major earthquake along the so-called ""Cascadia fault line"" located offshore in the Pacific Northwest - well above the San Andreas fault.  The program presents  lots of archival footage of the tsunami disaster in Sri-Lanka to allude to how devastating a coastal earthquake can be.and many stock shots of angry ocean waves and people walking around in cities full of tall buildings as the narrator does a lot of ominous ""what if"" speculation about a potential Cascadia quake.  Perhaps the most intriguing material provided focuses on scientists who demonstrate historic & geologic evidence of previous times when this fault shifted. As far as 'simulations' of tidal waves and/or land-based earthquake disaster goes - there are only a couple of limp CGI effects of swaying buildings and rippling roadways to allude to how such an event might manifest. Over-all, however, this is a pretty dry little scientific extrapolation with little 'exciting' visual material.

The DVD actually includes a second 'bonus' feature of equal length entitled ""Earthquake Storm"" that features a similar scientific investigation into the phenomenon of 'sequential' earthquake patterns - such as have apparently been observed in parts of the Middle East. This feature also mostly shows present day 'crowd scenes' and scenery of the regions being discussed - but no earthquake simulations.

While both of these programs are interesting enuf in their own rights as a light weight educational experience - they sure don't provide anything visually exciting and left me feeling sorta ripped off by the 'hype' of the product description for 'action' that was not delivered.  Maybe a 'renter' - not much of a 'keeper' - unless, perhaps, you are a grade school science teacher who might want to show it as an educational film about fault-lines. Time would be better spent re-watching the San Andreas disaster segments from the film ""2012"".",1432684800,2,2670,5.131336405529954
7031487,1,B00UA00H1W,CASCADIA should be the title,1432684800,2,28,4.8
7031488,1,B00UA00H1W,"1. Sounds like a disastermovie. It is not. Its a documentry. As such its a 5 very educational. But as is very misleading.
2. San andreas? I don't think it was even mentioned. It was in the bonus feature a little as background.
3. Next megaquake? Will be in cascade/seattle washington or in bonus feature istanbul turkey in the next 10 mins-100 years. Not san andreas.
In summary-an excellent movie that has nothing to with a san andreas megaquake disaster. Lol!",1432339200,5,461,4.703703703703703

8704853,3,B00UA00H1W,"As a documentary it does a good job, though the picture reflects the fact that t was mostly shot on old video tape.
