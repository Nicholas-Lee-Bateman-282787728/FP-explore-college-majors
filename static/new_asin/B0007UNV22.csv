8189161,1,B0007UNV22,"Possibly the worst film transfer I have ever seen.  Image is out of focus, appears to be on a concave surface and isn't even centered in the frame (left edge and bottom feather out to black at a skewed angle).  To add insult to injury, Alpha places a waterwark on the top right corner for a portion of the movie.  Shamefully poor quality DVD.",1490486400,,342,4.3125
8189162,1,B0007UNV22,"Did not work.  The only thing I have purchased from Amazon that was bad.  Unfortunately both it for a gift, so I was a little embarrased.",1426118400,,137,4.230769230769231
8189163,5,B0007UNV22,"This would be a typical crime/wrong man accused film except for one thing - Anne Rutherford.

I'm not sure why this lady did not become a big star. She should have. To be honest I think she is the hottest actress I've seen in a wrong time. I could not keep my eyes off hte screen when she was on.

She is very, very beautiful and her acting was decent as well.

The film itself follows the usual formula: girl helps wrongfully accused guy. Real villian gets arrested at the end. Girl and guy fall in love.

Without anne rutherford it woudl be three stars. With her its five stars.",1146787200,2,580,4.245454545454545
