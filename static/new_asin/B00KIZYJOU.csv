8659443,1,B00KIZYJOU,"Roscoe (Lil Capp) is the ""good guy"" in this film. Our good guy becomes envious of what money can buy and decides to sell drugs. He is an instant expert. He gets together a crew, makes up some t-shirts, and steps on the territory of Deuce (Yasin Abdul) leading to a gang war.

The film is short- 62 minutes. The characters are never developed, and all seem the same. The outdoor sound was bad. The acting was horrible, as it appears they all went to a 50 Cent acting school. About 30 minutes into the film, they opt to add about 10 minutes of softcore with sex and dancers. The film ends with a music video.

Unless you are really into Lil Capp, or gansta movies, you should avoid this one.

Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, nudity. Unrealistic killing scenes.",1408752000,,755,4.41726618705036
