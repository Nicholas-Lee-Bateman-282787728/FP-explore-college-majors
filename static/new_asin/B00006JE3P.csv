All the elements, including Jane Seymour's stunning beauty and acting, the spacey music by Paul Chihara, the attention to detail in Hiro Narita's amazing visuals and ability to capture shadows and light to great and unsettling effect, Michael Berk and Douglas Schwartz's perfect mixture of romance and ghost story in the teleplay and John Korty's direction of the whole thing make this one you won't forget.
Check out the references to Japan in the imagery when you would least expect it (probably due to the two Japanese people working on this - you'll know it when you see it) which add even more distinction to this unique project. The only downside is Gerald McRaney's stiff and annoying portrayal of Jane's faded football star husband (as if he could get Jane anyway!!)
This is one to look for if you are into offbeat movies that are best viewed while hallucinating.",1246579200,,976,4.850299401197605

7970130,4,B00006JE3P,"I am a great fan of actress Jane Seymour, and always find something to appreciate about her performances, whether in good or so-so productions. This rather obscure film (which explains the exorbitant DVD price) popped up on Youtube and I thought Id watch it to see what it was about.

This is a supernatural drama which centers on a married couple (Seymour and actor Gerald McRaney) who move into a beautiful house overlooking the California coast. The husband, a once football star and now sportscaster is busy with his work which leaves Seymour alone in her new home, occupied with domestic duties. Then strange experiences convince Seymour that something is not right, and she frequently dreams of romantic encounters with a mysterious stranger. Meanwhile, the couples sex life is marred by the husbands impotence. As time passes, it becomes evident that a supernatural entity has romantic intentions towards Seymour, which spells doom for anyone or anything that comes between them.

Typical of 80s films, the soundtrack and effects seem rather cheesy by todays standards, but the lovely Ms. Seymour makes it all worthwhile.",1446940800,,1128,5.158469945355192

7970135,5,B00006JE3P,"It's kind of a corny film, but well worth the watching for the eroticism with Jane Seymour, even though there is no actual nudity.",1381449600,,130,4.458333333333333
