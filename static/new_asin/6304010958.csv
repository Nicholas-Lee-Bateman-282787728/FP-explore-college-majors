766066,3,6304010958,"Call it a cop-out, but there is an automatically redeeming element to a movie that sticks to the basics and refuses to take itself too seriously. And nowhere is this more important than in the world of ""B"" martial arts flicks, though Jet Li's work has managed to downplay a lot of the comedic elements in favor of a deeper, philosophical style of message that has proven to be masterfully effective. Languishing in the 2nd tier of straight-to-video offerings on the western side of the Atlantic is the assorted works of child actor and martial arts protege T.J. Roberts, of which ""Tiger Heart"" is generally regarded as being the most reviled and dismissed. This could be chalked up to a number of possible reasons, be it shifts in the market as the 90s grew more and more cynical, or just the fact that a 16 year old Karate Kid knockoff with a girlfriend hotter than Elizabeth Shue was circa 1984 isn't as fetching as a 12 year old kicking the butts of as many as a dozen grown men in a way reminiscent of 3 Ninjas, but either way, most see this as a soon-to-be-forgotten flop from a child-star who was getting too old for the business. Naturally, the author of this review begs to differ.

While obviously this is far from Oscar material, there is a lot of entertaining content to be found on here. The overtly campy approach; replete with mid 90s pop culture references, mild yet difficult to miss stereotypes (they cover all the bases from the Hollywood homosexual interior designer to the singing Mexican housekeeper), and a healthy dose of upper-class dysfunctional family gags (the absolute icing on the cake being the serial-monogamist sister of T.J. portrayed by brunette bombshell and playboy/penthouse centerfold Lorissa McComas, who literally has a different boyfriend every scene she appears in) leaves me in stitches every time. Similarly, the 2 principle villains provide a boatload of farcical gags, all but channeling the same comedic gold that was struck with the millionaire developer and his cliche Jeeves butler in ""Enter The Ninja"". The fight scenes, which are all one-sided slaughters showcasing the chops of T.J. Roberts, occur in fairly rapid succession (about once every 10 minutes) and prove to be quite impressive when compared with parallel choreographed duels in the various 3 Ninjas flicks (which this definitely resembles) along with contemporary Cynthia Rothrock and Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson flicks. There's no master arch-nemesis to speak of, something that wouldn't hurt to have added in for additional thrills, but not every film need model the big boss fights common to Bruce Lee's classic works.

Perhaps the one area where things suffer a bit is that this film, in contrast to the 2 Magic Kid movies, goes a bit overboard on the number of characters and leaves zero room for any development to speak of apart from T.J. Robers and his love interest, both of whom are completely static and predictable. This isn't a coming of age story after the mold of The Karate Kid where a hot-headed spazz morphs into a disciplined fighter, but a almost unbelievably restrained grandmaster in a 16 year old's body who knows all the moves and has the right philosophy, and just proceeds to use the bad guys as his personal punching bag. Anyone viewing this film looking for story depth won't find it anywhere save maybe researching the background of the supporting cast, whose ranks include Rance Howard (father of well-known actor and director Ron Howard), Carol Potter (played Mrs. Walsh on Beverly Hills 90210 for the full 8 year run) and the Klimaszewski twins (numerous appearances in well-known slapstick spoofs such as ""Date Movie"", ""Spy Hard"" and ""Scary Movie 3""). Still, the laughs are around every single corner of this thing, so much so that even some hardened intellectuals might lighten up a bit in spite of themselves.

My principle complaint about this DVD is the lack of any noteworthy features apart from chapter selection. It basically watches like a VHS with the ability to skip around faster. Nevertheless, it is good to see that this got a digital release at all given a number of 80s and 90s flicks that have yet to get their place on a disc format. Life can get unbearable when taken seriously all the time, and this is one in a good number of films that will cure the ""all-serious, all-the-time"" blues.",1358035200,,4348,4.857142857142857

It's a fun slice of mid-90s nostalgia that's unfortunately cluttered by an unfocused screenplay and a couple unlikeable touches, but if you can somehow get around paying the ridiculous price it's going for these days, it's worth picking up the DVD for fans of any of the abovementioned.

The story: martial arts-practicing teenager Eric (Roberts) becomes romantically involved with a pretty girl (Jennifer Lyons,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transylmania/dp/B002VECM9K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transylmania</a>) whose family-operated market has become the target of a greedy property baron (Kristopher Kriesa,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Blood/dp/B000GRUMR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Blood</a>) and his gang of ruthless enforcers.

Whether or not you enjoy this movie will largely depend on how much fluffy padding you can tolerate in a 90-minute film. I didn't count the minutes, but a fair chunk of the flick consists of nonstop bantering between Roberts and his onscreen pal (Timothy Williams,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cheers/dp/B000A0GOQ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cheers</a>), shared goo-goo eyes between Roberts and Jennifer Lyons, and random throwaway scenes like when Roberts and Williams get harassed on their way to a party, resulting in a very short car chase. I'd estimate that as much as 15% of the film is made up of this nonsense, and while it's all fine and silly in several instances, the movie definitely crosses the line of where it's simply killing time. There are also just a few plain weird turns, like how lead henchman Robert LaSardo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Death-Race/dp/B001ILHY1I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Death Race</a>) and his goon spend a good deal of their time intimidating underage kids (real brave, guys) and how they get their comeuppance in a climatic scene wherein Eric corrals a bunch of little kids from his karate dojo to beat them up - a pretty childish turn for a film that's already dropped the F-bomb.

Overall, however, the fight scenes are generally good. This is one of the vehicles for Roberts wherein his character doesn't need to get beat up first to realize his martial potential, so his impressive physicality is displayed right from the start and throughout most of the nine fights. These matches are generally filmed via handheld camera from an appealingly a wide angle, but some still feature obstructive quick-cut editing. The choreography and fight layout have highs and lows, with one of the latter being a disappointing exchange between Ron Yuan (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Deadly-Target/dp/B000EWBO7C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Deadly Target</a>), his lady friend (Jhoanna Trias), and LaSardo's thugs. The action centerpiece is an extended brawl pitting Roberts and action director Art Camacho against a gang of twenty: it's a bit overlong and more than a bit unbelievable in its layout, but still fun to watch as a platform for its stars. Roberts also gets a couple chances to display his proficiency with weapons, including a nunchuka duel and an exchange with escrima sticks.

Following this film, Ted Roberts would finish out the ""Masked Rider"" TV show and then largely refrain from onscreen martial arts for the rest of his still-ongoing career. We can't rule out that he'll never throw kicks and punches for the camera again, but if this is the case, ""Tiger Heart"" is a reasonably decent film to end that part of his career with. Again, it's not worth paying over $100 for (or even over $20), but TJR should definitely be on the lookout for this one.",1362009600,2,4254,6.304123711340206
