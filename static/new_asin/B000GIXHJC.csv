The information is straight-forward and clearly illustrates the dangers of foods made with sugar and white flour, as well as all processed foods.  I live in the Phoenix area (where Dee resides) and have met her personally.  She is very educated in nutrition and truly desires to help all who wish to improve their diet and overall health.  Parents, pick up a copy of this DVD and watch it with your children... you will ALL learn a great deal and your lives will be much better for it!",1200614400,,576,4.563106796116505
8132938,2,B000GIXHJC,"I purchased this DVD because I loved Dee's Mightly Cookbook and was looking for more information about the specifics of her eating plan. This DVD really did not give me what i was looking for and had very little new info. My advice is to buy Dee's Mighty Cookbook by Dee McCaffrey and enjoy the info and recipes, but skip this DVD which is much less helpful.",1187654400,3,358,4.358208955223881
