8304103,4,B001G6BDWG,"This is one of the best documentaries which supports the claim that Atlantis was located in the Caribbean-Bahamian area of the Atlantic Ocean, showing some indisputable evidence of an ancient maritime culture which flourished there some 8,000 to 12,000 years ago - the time frame in which legendary Atlantis allegedly existed, according to the Greek philosopher Plato.
The documentary is hosted and researched by Dr. Greg Little, with his wife Lora Little, both professionals in their field, a team of marine archaeologists. They were assisted in their research by Atlantis expert archaeologist and anthropologist William Donato of the APEX Institute. Their research is primarily at Bimini Island, and other sites such as Andros Island and a reef area known as Cay Sal.
The documentary also features an in-depth look at the famous ""sleeping prophet"" Edgar Cayce, with a biographical look at his life and career, and how his writings tie into the Atlantis research, through the auspices of John van Auken of the Edgar Cayce Institute, or ARE (Association for Research and Enlightenment) in Virginia Beach, Virginia.
In my opinion, too much of the documentary focuses on Edgar Cayce, and not enough time is given to the real Atlantis research at Bimini and the Bahamas. Still, it's a very well done and informative documentary, and I highly recommend it to anyone interested in what the latest updates are in Atlantis research in the Bahamas.",1268697600,9,1440,5.1581196581196584
