8476409,4,B005K0WF8A,"Why oh why is it not available in HD? The film captures some extraordinary footage of death valley including a rare glimpse after a springtime rainstorm when flowers color the desert. Worth seeing but it's a crime it's not available in HD. The DVD is barely average quality and isn't worth buying, better to watch it on prime.",1384560000,,326,4.637931034482759
