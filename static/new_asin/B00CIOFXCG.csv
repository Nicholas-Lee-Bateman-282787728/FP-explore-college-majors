8582144,2,B00CIOFXCG,"It is an interesting film, but not overly entertaining. Wade (Joe Turk) runs an environmental product pyramid scheme that is grossly unsuccessful. His mom (Mary Alice Adams) foots the bill. He leads a rather sad pathetic life with his drinking buddies and some guy Dave (Steven Dean Davis) who uses the back room for a group of cult drummers that would make Mickey Hart envious.

The film appears to show that pyramid schemes are for losers who follow a cult mentality. The characters are mostly dull and lifeless, perhaps by design. While this conveys a message, it lacks entertainment value, making this more in line as an indie film with a limited audience. The film is listed as a comedy, but I didn't find it amusing.

Guide: No F-bombs, or nudity. Near sex scene.
