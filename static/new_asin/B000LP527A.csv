8162623,1,B000LP527A,"I ordered, ""Bruce Lee JEET KUNE DO Volume 6 - Catch and Lock Techniques"" and sure enough, the box says it is, the label on the disc says it is, however, the contents of the disc appear to be from Volume 2.  My ability to read Chinese is limited, but that is what it looked like.  Anyway, there is not a single catch and lock technique on this DVD.  Rather, it was a series of kicks. How to use a primary side kick to the body of someone attempting to punch you, then how to use a primary roundhouse kick to the body and so forth.  There is also a counter, using an elbow block to the attackers incoming fist while simultaneously sun punching the attacker's face.  Perhaps a couple other variations of that and that is about it.  The fellow demonstrating is very good at what he does and my low rating is not against his abilities nor the quality of the dvd, rather, the low rating is to bring to your attention that the content, at least on my disc, is not what the label and box say it is.",1302825600,2,990,4.130208333333333
