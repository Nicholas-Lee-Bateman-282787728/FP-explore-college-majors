I hope I never share an airplane, restaurant or a restroom with misters Cooper & Farley .  their film made me feel like I was walking thru an unlighted street at midnight with the air & ground filled with sewer water. yuk.  give the sharpie who wrote the description a raise.  you got my buck.  aw- com -on-...can it be that bad?  I won't even dare you to watch it....it's ... it's ... yuk!
i'm tossing it out cause there is no one I would give it to or no library i'd donate it to.",1482537600,2,578,4.153153153153153
8758734,5,B01EH9Y0L4,"I saw this last week in New York at a Q and A with the wrtiter-directors, and I'd like to say:

I understand why some people are put off by this film--and it's a film, not a movie. But if they have an ax to grind (subject matter that isn't pleasant degrades everybody, experimentalism is bulls***, sex isn't nice, and not-nice sex is super-not-nice), so do people who are really, really interested in what film can do--and even what film can be made to do, when its essential elements are spotlighted, examined at length, poked at, pulled about, even turned inside out. Our ax says: Could you just watch this, please, and see what it's doing, and not doing, and not remake it inside your head as your worst nightmare, and evidence of the decline of civilization? That would be great. Thanks.

Like Cattle Toward Glow's biggest values for buck IMHO:
1) Dennis Cooper. C'mon. And Zac Farley and Michael Salerno, and the others. It's worth seeing cause it's a Moment in experimental film and its relation to contemporary literature. (And I can't wait to hear the whining that'll break out when they give Dennis the Nobel Prize for his screenplays.)
2) Seriously, it's *not* about porn, but it *is* about the pornographic imagination. There is a counter-current of work that deals in obscenities, horrors, the hornies, suppressed but vital material, that is the modern sublime in action, and in case people forget, the sublime is terrifying and upsetting, and it isn't all there is to art, but it has always, always been a core part of the work that art does. Because the sublime is all about what can and can't be represented--in words, in images--people sometimes respond to it by feeling, ""I shouldn't be hearing this. This shouldn't be seen."" And that's how we react to the subjects of pornography, whether that feeling of shouldn't makes us draw back and condemn, or return to it over and over. (Pornography isn't addictive; it's compelling.) To my mind, if a film makes its subject matter our obsessions with what we want to see but feel we mustn't, what we want to experience but go nuts when we realize that--well, that's good subject matter. But more than that, if you're interested in cinema/media/art, that's what representation is about. That's what there is to explore, if you're going to explore.
(Can I just compare this, irrelevantly, for a second to the repellent ""King Cobra,"" which turns on the self-reflective idea that if you're going to tell a story out of the porn world, you should do it with visual cliches, cheap fantasies, and terrible, wooden acting--like that turns making a bad movie into exploring an idiom. [This is not ""Boogie Nights,"" though it'd like to be.] It's a feckless insult against the people whose story it tells, because it can't approach them without condescending and judging and assuming the superiority of the indie feature to outright porno. Good luck with that.)
I'm going on about this because I think work like ""Like Cattle Towards Glow"" is usually discussed, and even seen, in a mistaken and even irrelevant context.
3) Dennis Cooper has repeatedly shown a capacity to respond in words and images to the latest cultural influences from technologies of art--of information, diversion, entertainment, and more than anything else, community-making. He has maybe the reputation of making transgressive art understandable and ultimately acceptable for an insular American audience and a reluctant critical establishment, and of influencing scores of writers and artists who are better mainstreamed than he has been. But when the smoke clears, I'm guessing that the first item on that Nobel citation is going to be his integration into literature--into poems that are novels, and novels that are games--the actualities of the media that occupy and transform our minds and our bodies. There just isn't anyone else that has thrown punk rock and raves, videogames and online solicitations for sex, blogs and gifs at us at his rate of literary assault, or as centrally, or as successfully. ""Like Cattle Towards Glow"" doesn't just depict the actual media world we live in, through which we experience the world and others; it grows out of that world and is a part of it; it is its substance. As you progress through this film, that realization comes clearer and clearer, until in the last sequence, there's a kind of coda that ties the musical themes together, and you get where you've been, and what you're walking back out into.
4) The negotiation of cinematic space. The faces, body parts, artificial stage sets and real apartments that all have equal size in your eye. This movie might put people off because everything about it is difficult--the acting, the dialogue, the scene-setting. It all breaks the rules. What did you expect, really? It's a punk film, to the extent that punk was and is a serious outgrowth of avant-gardism. It's taking films apart to start over, and personally, I'm kind of fascinated by how it re-learns the rules of cinematic space as it proceeds. Cause yeah, if you've got virtual space down, then you've really made a film, and I don't know, maybe even a movie. Twenty years from now when there are lots of movies that learn from it, maybe you'll be glad you were on it early?",1477699200,2,5249,4.8702460850111855
8758735,1,B01EH9Y0L4,"An odious mess, this film is the rancid underbelly of the independent film movement. Yes, anyone can make a film now, but some films should stay in their creators' psychoses.",1474761600,,174,4.833333333333333
8758736,5,B01EH9Y0L4,"What if maybe your therapist was something more like a drone pilot? What if 'Where the Wild Things Are' was reimagined by drug addicts? Im not entirely sure about what I just watched and Im currently still trying to piece things together, but Im really looking forward to more collaborations between Dennis Cooper and Zac Farley. Michael Salerno as well! I agree with what Dennis said in a recent interviewthis is more of a pornographic film that subverts pornography. It feels like you're gradually going numb as you stumble in and out of different dream-like scenariosespecially the final scenario, which, stylistically speaking, felt like something Ive never seen done in film before. I just kept asking myself, What the hell am I watching right now? Where am I? I don't mind long takes of the music of silence (i.e. Antonioni, Kieslowski, Denis) being utilized in films. But I think the combination of the two in this film was highly effective in sustaining a tension throughout. A tension that makes the viewer feel like they're occupying a state of mind that possibly exists somewhere between feeling alive and being dead. And in a film like this one, its sometimes hard to tell which is which. Hypnotic, visually stunning, and brutally tragic. It's as NSFW as it gets!",1469664000,2,1275,4.907407407407407
8758737,3,B01EH9Y0L4,"Five short stories (experiences?) having a similar theme of sexual fantasy. Depressing, incomprehensible, irritating and pretentious. The film has a slow, moody and deliberate pace. Its sometimes hypnotic, with some well-constructed compositions, long extended takes, slow camera panning, all giving it a serine and contemplative quality. Some of the dialog is lost in inaudible mumbling, and there doesnt seem to be much point to it at the end.  I don't know many people to recommend this film to.",1469664000,3,498,5.384615384615385
8758738,1,B01EH9Y0L4,"This is a compendium of five grotesque short stories purportedly linked by the common theme of sex. The blurb describing this DVD on the DVD and repeated on this website is an incoherent jumble of pompous nonsensical verbiage. Each story on this DVD is either repellent or inexplicable or both. A great deal of what passes for dialogue is totally lost by what is mere mumbling on the part of the actors. Not that clear speech could possibly make a difference when it comes to comprehending the various story lines in this film. What we have is a nihilistic, incoherent, ugly, and depressing approach to sex and self image masquerading as some profound psychological and philosophical discourse. To describe each segment and attempt to make sense of it, if even possible, would take up more space than the film footage that presented it in the first place. Is life and sex nothing more than a negative mish mash? Perhaps that's what the two authors of this film intended.to convey. (This film deserves no stars.)",1464739200,8,1011,4.816091954022989
