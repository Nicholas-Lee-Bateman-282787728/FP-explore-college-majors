2163045,4,B00062IYXW,"My favorites on this DVD are the ""Girl"" movies. This shows the creativity of Spencer Williams, despite the lack of materials and training he had to work with.",1361145600,3,158,4.678571428571429

2163047,5,B00062IYXW,"Holy Mackeral! Saw this fim at the Lincoln Theatre in Charleston, South Carolina in 1942 and enjoyed it and then enjoyed it again 70 years later as it was almost like the original I saw upon the silver screen, what a delight! Spencer Williams produced and directed this great film and acted in it as well and was outstanding, as expected! Sarge Booker of Palm Coast, Florida",1346284800,12,374,4.597014925373134
2163048,5,B00062IYXW,"I recently viewed this DVD and enjoyed it.  I like knowing I am supporting black actors, producers, etc. that had talent and desire to create their own version of movies; those different from the white Hollywood genre.
Some of the filming is primative and some in poorer condition than others but this is history and should be viewed and enjoyed.
I especially enjoyed Lying Lips.  One actor in this film looked and sounded familiar and it turns out he is Earl Jones who is the father of James Earl Jones.  I of course had to check out more on google after viewing the film and also found out this was Earl Jone's first film.
I am building a library of old films including this genre and am excited that I discovered this diamond in the ruff!",1281225600,23,741,4.4338235294117645
2163049,4,B00062IYXW,"Everyone should get their hands on these films that are so out of circulation. The plots were suited to the day and were quite thin and flimsy, but to see them is worth sitting through them and having a good laugh. These important films are a boon to any serious collector,",1205193600,3,273,4.372549019607843
2163050,3,B00062IYXW,"""Race movies,"" a genre unique to the United States between 1915 and 1947, were quite popular with black Southern audiences and in Northern industrial cities that had large African American communities. After the successful legal desegregation of the film industry in 1948, this type of movie vanished, literally. Today, only a fifth of the original 500 race films still exist.
