6682335,5,B00NW6KRMA,"Great documentary about the liberal/progressive promises of Utopia that always leads to dependency and poverty. Aptly themed like The Wizard Of Oz, it shows us how the charlatan who's promising the perfect world is just desperate, empty, little man when you look behind the curtain.",1418169600,17,282,5.288888888888889
6682336,2,B00NW6KRMA,"I was very disappointed with this movie.  I think my biggest complaint is there's just too much messing around and what seems like filler material.  The whole Wizard Of Oz parody gets old very quickly and the interviews are in between shots of abandoned buildings or Joel walking around.  There's just not enough content and what's there is nothing we haven't heard before.  In the end, there was more entertainment than serious coverage of the movement towards socialism.",1418083200,5,472,5.012820512820513

I have a degree in political science and have made it a point to make myself open to every side of an argument.  This is not an argument.  It's just a good example of how some American's viewpoints are skewed to the very fringes of reality.

It gets two stars because the filmmaker's attempts at satire are so bad that they actually made me laugh on several occasions.

A fun fact about this movie:  The constantly talks about how the Affordable Healthcare Act (Obamacare) is harming our country.  The filmmaker uses exerts from interviews at the Heritage Foundation during the film to help make his point.

6682373,5,B00NW6KRMA,"Great documentary by Joel Gilbert!!  This is one of the best movies I've seen on the impact of socialism and its destruction of society.  The movie was a little cheesy at first but stay with it, it really gets better as it goes along.  It shows the early deceptions of socialism and the weakness of humans to the attractive ideas that socialism offers.  It then looks at how destructive socialism is to a capitalistic society.  I think every high school and college student should watch this movie!!!",1501891200,,500,4.7011494252873565
6682374,3,B00NW6KRMA,"Jump past the first 10 minutes. Amateur scene changes and atmospheric dribble that sets the tone for the quality of the film. The main subject of ""Utopia"" kept me watching most of the movie. The topic itself was interesting. The quality and tone of the production of this documentary was extremely low brow. They added useless scenes that went on forever. Was it because of their inability to provide more hard facts? Obama is headlined as the ultimate villain in this catastrophic political quagmire. Sadly, this documentary lacked the vision to include the other politicians/corporations from our past & present who contributed to this political science experiment gone wrong.",1501545600,,678,5.229357798165138

6682379,1,B00NW6KRMA,"If you are looking for any information whatsoever, this film is not for you. Other than the sort of interesting parallels between the words of Obama and the Wizard of Oz, this was a big nothing. The message of the whole thing seems to be that anyone claiming that they have an idea that will change society for the better is a person that, under no circumstances, should be trusted and also that such people invariably cause problems and proliferate dependence on government. But you won't know whether or not there's any truth to that, because NO INFORMATION IS GIVEN IN THIS FILM! The only thing you get is the opinions of people whose minds are already made up. You get a former auto manufacturer ridiculously claiming the day his employees were laid off was their happiest day of work as though ALL OF THEM were just dying to leech off of the government, getting paid way less than they used to and only for a short amount of time. And of course, nowhere in the discussion of how things went wrong in Detroit, was it mentioned that car companies, before that time in history, didn't have realistic prospects of basing operations overseas to cut costs and how much of a completely irresistible lure it was for them to pay their employees pennies an hour instead of dollars, along with the reduction of every other cost associated with doing business as a car manufacturer. Nope, instead, the story was just that mean politicians came to Detroit and made it just to difficult or expensive to operate in America. I'm sure that's why that had to, very reluctantly of course, turn to third world slave labor to survive... and gain far greater profit. And you get testimonials from know-nothing conservatives who think they know far more than they do: one guy who doesn't even seem to know the difference between socialism and communism constantly talking about what and how they THINK! And another who, and I relish this sort of narrow minded dismissive thoughtless attitude toward a vast and diverse group of people, said about criminals ""There's something wrong with them, that's why they're criminals."" with a a scoffing laugh). Oh and you get residents of Detroit saying the corrupt politicians are the cause of the city's problems which you would find in any city where joblessness is rampant and the city can't pay for basic services to the citizenry. One single solitary piece of information about what they actually did would be helpful. I think Obama is a company man just like the rest of them, but this is nothing more than an attack piece directed toward anyone who claims they want to ease society's ills. And that is a profoundly wrong message. There are real problems, real inequality. There is real strife in the US and the last thing that will help us as a people is this pointless one-sided drivel designed to make you distrust anyone that claims they want to help you. Not everyone is a wolf in sheep's clothes. Nice people who want to solve problems just for the sake of doing something good and right do exist. This film would have you turn your back on that nice person the moment they have the audacity to claim they have a plan to solve something that is fundamentally wrong in our society. This is just trash to enrage and convert angry frightened simpletons. How about giving me some real info in this two hour pile!!!",1499904000,2,3343,4.67741935483871
6682380,1,B00NW6KRMA,This movie's premise that Obama is a communist is ridiculous. Communism was discredited decades ago and no serious world leader pretends otherwise.  The movies goal appears to be making fun of the American Democrat Party and paints a picture of the political party as un-American.  It shocking that people actually believe this stuff.,1499817600,,334,5.283018867924528
6682381,1,B00NW6KRMA,"The movie tries to discredit socialism. It uses props and poses clever questions to random people in order to make the point. It also relies heavily on the the theme of utopia and the Wizard of Oz. But the movie fails to address any issues substantively. You don't go away having learned WHY and HOW communism and socialism have failed, and why and to what extent capitalism is better. It offers no solutions, just hurling vitriol on Obama. Mind you, Obama is not at all the evil ""socialist"" the film portrays him to be. He didn't advocate ANY radically new socialist legislation (Obama care is a mere extension of medicare, which ALL seniors support. Also, the mandate to purchase insurance exists with automobiles and nobody seems irked by it). So it's unfortunate that the director uses Obama as the scapegoat for societal problems without addressing or even mentioning them himself. I was waiting for the film to get to the point, but after 25 minutes of watching I gave up and abandoned it. Waste of time.",1498521600,4,1010,4.744318181818182

This film is based on the facts of political experimentation from the beginning of the 20th century onward. If presents reality and expresses concerns over the direction of America. Many, obviously, voted for Mr Obama's change but we all (at least those who will openly examine the facts) saw the decline of America across the boards (taxation sky high, debt ever increasing, poverty rates increased, unemployment truthfully high everywhere, violence and corruption, on and on) and THIS FILM pretty accurately portrays the reasons. Socialism! Cloward-Piven is explained clearly and the graphics of immigration and entitlements is obvious... to those who will think and openly consider what is occurring. The complexity of all the issues is far too convoluted to be fully explained in an hour or two. This film is about the foundations of disruption and corruption within America and every parent should show the expose to their kids and grandchildren because their lives will be terribly altered unless we prevent the ""change"" being falsely promised as 'hope' for their future.

6682395,1,B00NW6KRMA,"Racist. There is one point where the narrator visits a high school. As they flip through the old yearbooks from the 1960s, they discuss what a ""quality"" school it was, while showing pictures of the all-white students and faculty. They then highlight names from a ""current"" (I assume when the movie was made) yearbook, showing all Hispanic and minority names and faces, and talk about what a terrible school it is now, pointing out how the school even has an in-school police force. Which a large majority of schools do now, regardless of their demographics. Later, the narrator visits and discusses a church that was remade into a mosque. Obviously, that change is a negative one. The narrator attempts to discuss issues like Obama's amnesty, and implies that because of Obama, Hispanics will be racing to fill our country, putting a tax burden on the people who are already here. He very blatantly states that illegals all want to come here for ""free stuff,"" And when he discusses this issue with someone who is informed and can see the whole picture, he essentially censors what the man has to say, warping his voice whenever the man is about to make an intelligent statement, such as when the man begins to talk about how hard-working many immigrants are, or immigrants who pay taxes. He attempts to look as though he cares about minorities who are here already. I do not understand this concept of ""I have been here longer, therefore anyone who came after me should go back where they came from!"" We are all immigrants. We talk about the fear of Hispanics coming and ""taking all our jobs,"" but no one ever talks about how we originally stole this land from Native Americans. So 99% of Americans are immigrants or are descended from immigrants. Back around the turn of the 20th century, people in America were spouting the same rhetoric about European and other immigrants. If the people back then had listened, how many of you would not be here today to try to stop the next generation of Americans from gaining access to the same hopes and dreams that your ancestors once came for? And this is not a contest to see who has been here longest, that is irrelevant. Many of these immigrants are escaping dangerous circumstances because they want a better life for their children. I think their bravery for the good of their families ought to be applauded. Wouldn't you do whatever it took to keep your children safe?  Letting them come and work and pay taxes would help our economy. And all that talk about how liberals are trying to get more illegals in to the country so they will vote democratic? Well, conservatives employ many tactics to ensure that many liberal voters never get the chance to vote. Regardless of how many hundreds of years they have been in this country. Tactics like over policing minorities, who often lose the right to vote when they are arrested and convicted of non-violent drug related felonies, in many states they lose that right to vote even after they are out of prison. Gerrymandering, Voter ID laws, these are all designed to fight the conservative fight and keep minorities from voting. Most states and most independent studies show that Voter fraud--especially in person voter fraud--is very, very low-instance or doesn't happen at all. I get that someone from the conservative side has to keep up with all the ""liberal"" documentaries out there that discuss all the tactics conservatives use to keep the average man down, but this just went too far. And what's wrong with socialism? It is not the root of all evil. Many European countries have a centralized health care system, but still have democratic elections and representation. They have not had their society fall apart. In fact, they are healthier and work less than we do. Yes, taxes might go up a bit. (Although if we scaled back our meddling in the world, we could probably just reshuffle the bloated military budget and not have to raise taxes at all.) But so what if your income taxes go up another 5-10%, if you NEVER HAD ANOTHER MEDICAL BILL? Or had to pay tuition for your children to go to school? Or knew that when they got out of school, they actually had a chance at success instead of a lifetime chained to school loan repayment? Does that tax hike seem small compared to a world without medical or school costs?

6682398,5,B00NW6KRMA,"Joel Gilbert might seem nutty when he's skipping across a golden brick road, but in reality, he cleverly weaves the well loved fairy tale of Wizard of Oz into the socio-economic climate of the united states since the inception of communism, marxism and socialism in the 20s that had since made its ways to our shores. The idea is, socialism promises a utopia that appeals to the masses but in reality it could never come to fruition due to one simple factor: human greed. The idea that we as humans are entitled to freedom, rights, welfare etc without having to pull your own weight is ludicrous because what ends up happening is a completely breakdown of our system which leads to laziness, the collapse of the free market, the collapse of capitalism and finally, of civilization. From it, those who pushed this agenda, namely the globalists will erect a brand new civilization the promised ""Utopia"" the same that all marxist and communists regimes under such  distasteful characters as Mao, Kim, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, Castro etc... countless intellectuals have died under their rule and those socialists who put them in power enslave them.

The most heartbreaking part of the video is the detroit scenes (Stephen Crowder has also done a walkthrough of the abandoned houses there). The fact that 50 years of democratic leadership in Detroit has whittled it into a post apocalypse scene and the fact that the people there, particularly black minorities cannot rise from the ashes because they are so totally dependent on the government and still buy into the false promises sold to them by the democrats that they cannot escape the false reality of ""Oz"" of an Emerald City Utopia filled with promises.

If you are a leftist or a communist (as I once was, heck I adopted communist doctrines early on and did believe in bloodshed towards a better society... I shudder to think back) you must watch this documentary and open your eyes to the dangerous idealogy you are furthering because when it comes down to it, the people will not be the rulers of the new world. The puppermasters will be. And first ones they will dispose of are the Antifas, the communists, the SJWs, the feminists of the world in order to further their agenda--- a global society ruled by them. This is not a cnspiracy theory... it's a plausible means to an end based on what has happened to our country within the last century.

We dodged a bullet--- whether you supported Trump or not, we have thrown away Obama's countless lies and pandering (it is frightening to know that leftists still don't understand that Obama doubled the national debt, killed tens of thousands in drone strikes, created the worse race relations domestically since before civil rights and cheated millions of blacks across the US because he sold out, he was corrupted). We must fight back against the establishment both on the left and the right, which has been hijacked by the globalists.

6682399,1,B00NW6KRMA,"This is one of the most ridiculous fear-mongering documentaries I've ever seen. There's nothing presented of substance. Democrats/progressives of modern America are not trying to re-create the totalitarian socialism of the Lenin/Stalin regimes. Progressives look to models that work in countries like Sweden/Italy/Finnland/Portugal etc, in an attempt to better our own country by adopting policies proven to work elsewhere. Universal Health Care reduces the cost of health care, reduces a massive burden on small business, and strengthens the American middle class. Higher wages strengthen the middle class by increasing consumer spending power thus increasing economic growth. Marijuana is not a gateway drug, and legalizing it does not create more users, in fact Portugal decriminalized all drugs over 15 years ago, they will not arrest you for drug use (even things like meth/cocaine), instead they invested massively in rehabilitation and education, this policy resulted in a massive decrease in usage and has been far more successful than the War on Drug policies. Finally, the desecration of Detroit was not a result of local liberal policies, it was a result of disastrous conservative-endorsed freed trade policies that shipped jobs over-seas and shut down Detroit's thriving industrial center. Don't allow this guy to trick you with his distortion of facts and attempts to sway with provocative imagery. The whole film is him walking around America, pointing out the poor decrepit parts, and saying ""look this is American Socialism at work."" I could've done the same thing during the Bush Era, a period when Detroit was just as decrepit, but instead I could've blamed the disastrous trade policies, our enormous military budget, and our lack of spending in infrastructure.

6682410,2,B00NW6KRMA,One big straw man argument. To portray liberals as naive about the impossibility of utopia is disingenuous and nothing more than an attempt to slander in order to distract from some otherwise reasonable questions they might have. Is it shameful to stay in pursuit of beneficial priorities for your Gov't's spending? To keep them in alignment with what can best benefit our society as a whole? What is the collective responsibility of a citizen in a civilized society? In WWII it was considered patriotic for a citizen to give of himself for the collective good of defeating the enemies of our state. Is health care's cost becoming a societal danger large enough to collectively tackle or is it's cost increase merely free markets natural selection of who the privileged are that get to benefit from it?  Should the quality of the education that our children receive be in direct correlation with their income? Should high income allow individuals to escape the perils of the less fortunate? Why does a system that ask for no collective help from its citizens engender patriotism better than one that ask for collective help? I respect the concern that a citizen can be asked to give to much(true socialism). This show is clearly a partisan hit job. Enjoy just stay aware of this.,1488672000,2,1279,4.86697247706422

Yes there are plenty of buildings in decay but there is much restoration and improvements. Downtown is a beautiful bustling city like amy other city. There's the river walk along the river between the U.S. and Canada. There's GREEKTOWN with delicious food and the Casino. There's the New NFL FOOTBALL stadium, Ford Field, and  new Tiger Stadium, Comerica Park. The city is diverse and there's many artists and students that go to Wayne State University. Eastern farmers market is a vision quest of visual amd sensual delights. So many important and talented people have their roots in Detroit.

It used to be the land where dreams could have a reasonable chance to come true. I was born the year that bastardo young was elected and he was still there when I left 19 years later. The kleptocracy is unbelievable!! But let's not think and vote the same people in over and over. I've traveled and lived all over. It breaks my heart to say so, but I felt safer in Seoul than my hometown. It's only my side, the southwest side, that is reasonable, not always, but isn't vacant monuments and acres of nature. The homes are still full.
People are not knowledgeable about the real issues and who created them and that was reinforced by school. I asked my civics teacher what the difference was between R & D. His answer still sticks with me ""Republicans are for the rich, democrats are for the poor"". We figured we're poor, we must be democrats. Every person I know who escaped alive, minus 2, COMPLETELY changed when they got out and saw the country and compared it to the dystopia of Detroit. It's a perfect conflagration. Keep schools bad so the kids come out unprepared, drive out all the jobs through excessive taxation, among other things, make promises that they will fix it if you just vote for them and the reality is that it gets worse and they blame the wrong people. I understand what everyone was talking about in regards to 911. My friend died because EMS never showed up, the cops did and took him in their car. I can see it now in my current city, when I lived near LA, NC was decent. I saw straight through that charlatan ozbama the first speech I heard. I was about to leave the country so wasn't involved except on a personal level. Last election we were very engaged.

6682455,5,B00NW6KRMA,"""There's No Place Like Utopia"" is one of the most interesting and intriguing films I've viewed.  The title alone conveys much as well as providing an excellent overview of the primary theme once one understands the origins and Greek meaning of the often misunderstood word Utopia.  Filmmaker Joel Gilbert has tackled an important subject and done so in a thoughtful but creative, highly illustrative manner.  Mr. Gilbert astutely turns to ""The Wizard of Oz"" as allegory as well as a means of carrying the film's narrative, with very effective results.  Reminiscent of Virgil guiding Dante in ""The Devine Comedy"" Joel Gilbert guides the viewer along an enigmatic yellow brick road that crisscrosses time and space, stopping in diverse places to meet a host of intriguing real-life characters.  One reason I found the film so compelling is that Mr. Gilbert allows the viewer to formulate their own conclusions as he interviews various people and turns his camera on a wide range of places that many of us will never have seen.  The film is not a heavy-handed editorial but rather a contemplative guided tour of the state of our Union which asks the viewer to honestly consider myriad facts and realities and what they portend for the future of the nation.  I highly recommend viewing this film with an open mind and a true desire to pay attention to the men behind the curtain.",1475539200,11,1375,4.875536480686695

Thousands of years ago, the Greeks came up with labels for different forms of social organization - very simple, and very reasonable. Even as a teenager, it was clear that the different forms were like tools in a toolbox. Just as you select the right tool for the job, we should select the right form of social organization for each aspect.

The founding fathers of the United States were smart pragmatists. Our country is an alloy of different forms.

But is this video, each form of social organization is treated like a religion. Either you are a true believer, or you are a heretic.

In this video, we spend far too much time looking at the author. I guess his hope is that a leather jacket, sunglasses, and bad hair - will somehow make him edgy. We also get cartoons to confirm each point of selective belief.

There are no incisive questions here.

The video spends a lot of time in Detroit, but no time at places where cars are now made in the United States. Why did Detroit fail? Why are other places in our country succeeding?

Joel Gilbert does a great job of connecting the dots between the sad realities of our corrupt government, and how the general population perceives them.  It's one thing to point out to people the raw facts, but as Mr. Gilbert demonstrates, sometimes people are more williing to consider the truth if they're presented with an analogy they can easily identify with.  The tour of the inner cities is shocking, disgusting, and sad, but Mr. Gilbert takes the time to examine what has driven the dramatic decline of these once-great cities, and that's IMPORTANT!!!  The film goes full circle in driving the point home, which in the end is gratifying. There is so much more work to do to open the eyes of our countrymen and to get people to CARE, but this film is a great contribution to that endeavor.

It's almost hilarious how the leftist progressive people that speak with him uniformly demonstrate the flaws and failures of socialism,  communism and cultural Marxism...almost,  but so many people keep believing that we just need the right wizard to come along and make socialism actually work. The saddest example of this in my humble opinion is the Latin immigrants who are fleeing countries that have been ruined by socialism to take advantage of capitalism in the U.S. while the American progressives are pushing socialism in our own country and misleading the immigrants into thinking that the democratic party had their best interests in mind. While some of the films animations may seem corny or low-budget,  I believe astute viewers will see the symbolism in Joel's decision to represent the idiocy of socialism and communism with cheap looking cartoon-like animation. The real content of the film,  that is the interviews and examinations of failed socialist policies, is something that should be seen by every American.

My main qualms with it is, while I believe Joel Gilbert makes some interesting points about the progressive agenda, more citations would be helpful in proving the point. He comes off like a Right Wing Michael Moore, and that's not a complimentary statement. To be fair, I did not see ""Dreams from my Real Father"" which crafted a narrative that Obama's father wasn't from Kenya, but was a prominent US Communist. But if you're going to make that a point in your current documentary, you may want to fill in your evidence for the audience who may or may not have seen any of the previous work.

I also found the CGI to be a little pointless. I understand it's a ""Wizard of Oz"" analogy. But it didn't really add anything to the overall product. But I'm much more intrigued by facts, statistics, news paper/print media/web media sampling and citation. I must be boring that way.

All in all, I found this documentary to be a little disjointed. And while I'm willing to humor most of the concerns about liberal policies not working in urban communities, more facts and data wins the argument.",1471564800,2,1112,4.697435897435898

6682576,4,B00NW6KRMA,"This low budget film is flippant, but there is a messages about how big government programs have lots of unintended consequences and how people who depend on big government are more often let down than helped.

I wish it would have been a little more scholarly perhaps drawing on those who have seen these problems coming many years ago or otherwise understood the importance of people interacting with each other in a free society is a much better societal model than big government using its heavy hand to promote crony capitalism (which many today wrongly equate to free market capitalism). Using some of the thoughts and ideas of Bastiat, Adam Smith, Hayek, etc. to show that these people predicted why big government is not the answer. Mr. Gilbert could have explained why the ideas of people such as Adam Smith were considered in the drafting of the U.S. Constitution.

The video drew heavily on the failure of Detroit. It could have gone further and used illustrations from the failures of socialists countries around the world. It could have shown how modern socialist countries that are heralded as successes by the left have had to undergo modification from their original plans and move towards freer, less government-controlled societies or fail.

These are some opportunities lost.

In any event, this video should promote some thought and perhaps some discussion. I am sure it will make some people steam because it pointedly goes after Mr. Obama when it should have aimed at a generally uneducated electorate who put people like Mr. Obama and many other past presidents and representatives into office. More specifically he could have delved into why some of the folks he interviewed in Detroit keep voting the same way generation after generation and keep getting the shaft generation after generation.",1465776000,3,1818,5.05

The comment that every socialist country has an evil wannabe God figurehead is simply false.  We have socialist countries that are not led by evil dictators.  But the film just pretends they don't exist.

You do know that Trolls did this, right?""  and because I SAID it, you should just believe me that Trolls exist and they did it.

Ridiculous and absurd.  I'm totally open to the idea that the PREDICTIONS in the film might turn out true or accurate but I don't appreciate a film that accuses one group of smoke and mirrors and then just does the same thing to try to get the point across.

6682605,2,B00NW6KRMA,"The content of this documentary does address some key problems in our society, however it addresses virtually all of them in a incredibly simplistic way.  At times it appears as if there is contempt built into the film, as the oversimplifications are literally ""dumbed-down"" into cartoon segments and crudely-produced snippets of disappointing overlays.  Film shots of dead and/or executed people are shown with audio sequences that are not even given context, let alone any sort of meaning.

There's a dark and disappointing theme running throughout the film, however I truly wonder if the filmmaker is aware that it's not the messages that he's trying to convey that are the most dark and disappointing part. Rather, it's the hypocritical and condescending manner in which he attempts to express them that disappoints.  He appears to believe he wields an incisive scalpel of logic; yet he spends the majority of the film clumsily brandishing the intellectual equivalent of a indiscriminate sledgehammer.

The filmmaker is his own worst enemy in this piecemeal parade of audio and video.

He may have some valid points, but he shoots himself in the foot instead of shooting a decent film.  There is little coherent or intelligent investigation into the nuances which create the conditions he uses as his central arguments.  When he should be considering the complexity of the world we live in and challenging simplistic interpretations of it, he chooses instead to point squarely at a generalized group of people and accuses them of being illiterate or foolish.

This film is self-depreciating to the filmmaker and ultimately childish in that it is repetitive and often flawed in its attempts to communicate any thing of substance.  The worst part is that he does not appear to be aware of any of this..",1464393600,4,1804,5.105442176870748

The idea that the only way to accept the contradictions and problems in pure capitalist economics pointed out by socialist theory is to apply pure socialism forced on all people through a military state. The films creators cannot accept the idea that pure capitalism might need tweaking and therefore believes anyone thinking otherwise is a communist. This is of course absurd. There have been many governments other than the failed communist states started and filled with politicians that read socialist theory.
One example is the USA. Democracy is a political system that promotes the freedom and the EQUAL RIGHTS of everyone. It has obvious parallels to socialist thought and should balance capitalism. That is why modern elected officials elected by people and business owners use regulations and laws to ensures a minimum standard of living FOR ALL citizens.

1) it is the fault of city governments that manufacturing jobs were shipped out of the U.S. leaving many Americans jobless. The bi-partisan promotion of anti-American free trade agreements by Bush, Clinton, and Congress have nothing to do with it.

2) Schools are better when they are all white. When brown people come, they ruin them. Apartheid is great.

3) Black and brown people are poor, stupid, lazy, and sucking all your money through socialism.

4) Poor white people do not exist, and therefore do not benefit from social safety nets.

6682704,4,B00NW6KRMA,"Same guy who produced ""Dreams From My REAL Father"" made this film; Joel Gilbert. It's a semi-satirical look at how Socialism is creeping into every aspect of American lives and how the Obama Regime is trying to rush the USA into becoming the USSA. Gilbert shows how the failed progressive policies of the Democrats for the past 50 yrs have made things worse, not better in the USA . Gilbert shows some balls as he takes a copy of his movie; ""Dreams From My REAL Father"" and drops one off at Bill Ayers' and with the mother of Moochelle Obama at their Chicago homes.
My only issue is the somewhat biased charges he lays on the Democrats for how many of the major cities in the USA have failed because of their socialist programs and policies. I can't speak to all the cities he shows in this documentary; but Detroit, in my experience, because I lived here most of my life, has been trashed not only by the failed policies and programs of the Democrats, but also greedy corporations, unions, racism - black and white - and peer pressure to live the suburban lifestyle. They all share in the blame for the downfall of Detroit; corrupt mayors, the UAW, AFSCME, SEIU, GM, Ford, Chrysler, the do-nothing-but-argue city council, unwillingness to get rid of the city income tax, and slumlords allowed to get away with not paying taxes or keeping their properties up, hamstrung or indifferent police, and people who would rather run from or ignore problems instead of helping to correct them. You may not agreed with the conclusions Gilbert has come to,however, you can't deny that urban USA is decaying and so is our standard of living. If we want to continue to have the lifestyle we have grown accustomed to, something needs to be done, soon, or we will become the 21st century version of the USSR....",1458259200,6,1796,4.633228840125392

It includes many propaganda faux pas, including cherry picking, appealing to childhood (what's with the creepy obsession with the Wizard of Oz, particularly Judy Garland, anyway?), and taking things so far out of context it would make a defamation lawyer blush.

For the haters of this movie, perhaps you should do way more research.  Dearborn, MI used to be way different  and a decent area and I was shocked and a bit worried to see what it has become. Great job in creating this film.",1456704000,8,412,4.1375
6682719,1,B00NW6KRMA,"This film is no documentary. I was excited to hear the other side's argument against socialism, but there is no clear argument throughout this film. The filmmaker tries to demonize socialism, but does it with no facts, sound bytes of interviews that present no clear argument, and blatantly incorrect opinions presented as facts. In fact, for the first 20 minutes of the movie I wondered how the movie was even about anything other than the Wizard of Oz.

If you're a sensible person don't watch this film; it will only infuriate you. However, if you're a Trump supporter I'm sure you will love this film as it has 0 facts and plays 100% on your emotions. I'm not sure if my favorite part was the filmmaker trying to blame the fall of Detroit on Democratic Socialist policies or the ex-KGB operative misusing the term Bourgeois. BTW, the fall of Detroit was because the auto industry left the city because it was good business; and that's Capitalism, not Socialism.

Lastly, this film is extremely racist. First the filmmaker interviews inner city black people to show how entire families are ""dependent on the socialist system"", basically saying they are a burden to the rest of us paying taxes. Then he interviews illegal immigrants in California to see why they came to America (to get better jobs and better pay), only to then turn around to the prior black people to get them to blame the illegals for them not having jobs. Finally he tries to show the decline of Denver and blames it on Latinos and Muslims. He interviews a gentleman, who is clearly a white supremacist, who is proud to show off his high school yearbook with his only white classmates and then contrasts it with a modern Denver yearbook and highlights all the Latino last names.

In conclusion this film is not worthy of being in the documentary category. It is an opinion piece that I'm sure many will call propaganda. But I'm sure for the many hateful people left in this country they will sign this movie's praise. If your IQ is over 100 do yourself a favor and skip this film because at the conclusion you will feel, like I did, angered and that you lost precious brain cells along the way.",1456704000,9,2167,4.638020833333333

6682814,1,B00NW6KRMA,"Same drivel as always. This movie is a laughingly transparent effort to keep the conservative base in fear so that they won't question all of the BS that the right is feeding them. Liberals want to create a communist utopia based on the USSR, People's Republic of China, North Korea, North Vietnam, and lest they are blamed for leaving anyone out Cambodia.  Yes, communism did not work out well in these places and they have all had and some continue to have very serious problems because of the way that they have decided to implement these policies in their countries.  Here's a thought - don't make the same mistake twice!  For just one minute try to stop tossing the word socialism around like it's an insult (it's not, we couldn't give less of a f*** who you call a socialist), stop patting each other on the back saying how great America is and try learning from other countries' successes and failures both.  Genocide is not a fundamental feature of communism.  For any conservatives that are scared by this movie, no, liberals are not planning on killing everyone with glasses.

Flip-flopping the views presented in this movie to make it a liberal criticism of conservatives would involve talking about the US Army slaughtering all of the Native Americans in an effort to achieve unbridled capitalism, and then jumping from that to saying conservatives today want to kill 95% of the population so that they can have more free land for themselves.  This is just as patently ridiculous as the movie's arguments against modern liberals in America.  FDR was a socialist and he is considered to be one of the greatest presidents that this country has ever had.  And he managed to do it without murdering his rivals, culling the party of dissenters, or forcing anyone to work in a forced labor camp.  But when Obama and now Bernie Sanders talk about doing some of the same things that FDR did they're traitorous commies and should never be allowed to hold office. I can only hope that the same logic (and I use that term loosely) is applied to any conservatives wanting to follow in Bush's shoes.

In the future please ftlog try learning what liberals are actually trying to do before starting a debate.  I know, that requires effort, and it's much easier to pop your dictionary open to the well worn page containing the definition of socialism, but we're kinda stuck with each other so we should try to find some common ground.  You don't like govt regulation?  Great, tell us how we can make it better without abolishing it.  Get corporations to work with us instead of against us so that we can create regulations that achieve the desired effect without being overly burdensome.  Don't like welfare?

6682815,4,B00NW6KRMA,"So if you've never seen a slow motion train wreck, pop this DVD into your player and catch an eyeful.  By the way, you (and I, and so many of us in the US) are stuck on that train.  Some forty days and nights from right now that hideous metal on metal sound you might be hearing should be one of the locomotive's wheels falling off. Why? Our near 19 trillion $ debt should just about be catching up to us by then. Is Big Government good, is socialism? The problem with socialism, according to Margaret Thatcher, is that it works until you run out of other people's money. Joel Gilbert seems none too impressed with socialism, and he builds a case against President Obama's socialist utopian agenda. Gilbert shows us how Detroit leaders' redistributionist vision has worked out for that city and its residents. Detroit is what it looks like after the train flew off the tracks. Gilbert's aproach isn't totally heavy-handed; he blends in some quirky humor to make the mix palatable.  As I was watching this video, I figured that Obama supporters (and Democrats in general) probably would not be able to watch it to its conclusion. Inspired by this movie, I have a challenge to my liberal friends: go before your other liberal friends and criticize President Obama on some trivial to important point. Even if you don't feel it or believe it, just for kicks, criticize President Obama. It could be about his shoes, the pen he uses, his unaffordable care act;  just criticize him in front of your other liberal friends. Maybe you can't do it; but if you do, prepare for the hurt and the hate coming your way, just for kicks.

6682839,4,B00NW6KRMA,"Joel Gilbert is the person who made the DVD, ""Dreams From My Real Father: A Story of Reds and Deception"", which speculates that avowed communist Frank Marshall Davis was not only Obama's ideological father, but also his genetic father.

The Utopia film follows the theme of the Wizard of Oz.  The wizard turns out to be a charlatan who enthralls people into believing that he is powerful and will bring prosperity and happiness to all.  It is a complete charade.  Once people fall into the wizard's trap, they cannot get out.  Dorothy cannot return home to Kansas--and neither can you.

The charlatans of Socialism are like the Wizard of Oz.  Their only desire is for personal power, and they deceive people into voting for their fairy tales of Utopia.  They prey on people's weaknesses, on their desire for free ice cream (for the unearned).  But, Socialism is bad because it can only result in poverty for all.  It is a false dream that cannot work.  This is a good video for people who haven't quite gotten the message yet, who don't quite understand that Socialism will result in their poverty and in their dependency upon an all powerful tyrant--a ""wizard"" who they voted into power.

As Margaret Thatcher said, ""The trouble with Socialism is that eventually you run out of other people's money.""  It robs Peter to pay Paul, until Peter has no money left.  Taking from Peter is a violation of his property rights which is why it is morally evil.  Socialism kills the goose that lays the golden eggs.  It slowly strangles the productive who create a society's wealth and prosperity.  When you take away their ability to profit, they will stop being job creating entrepreneurs.  Why should they work for nothing?  Would you?  The result will be economic stagnation and poverty for all.  (This happens to be the theme of the great novel, Atlas Shrugged, and also the source of its title.)

The Liberals/Progressives will say that the capitalists exploit the workers, that they steal from them to become rich.  That is a big lie.  How much wealth do the workers have that can be stolen?  The phrase ""to make money"" was coined in America.  It recognizes the fact that wealth is created, not stolen.  How much ""wealth"" was there in America before Columbus?  Entrepreneurs and industrialists used natural resources and created such an abundance of wealth that it astonished the rest of the world.

Mexico has an abundance of natural resources, but it is poor.  Its citizens flock to America for jobs and send most of the money to their impoverished families in Mexico.  If natural resources and ""muscle"" were the source of wealth, Mexico would be rich!  What is the fundamental source of wealth?  It is the human mind.  Thinking is the source of wealth.  It takes brains!  What allows thinking to create wealth?  Freedom.  When men are free to think and to put their thoughts into actions, they create wealth in order to best pursue their own happiness.  A nation's prosperity is proportional to its freedom.  Mexico is poor because it is not free.

Capitalists do not ""exploit"" workers; they employ them in a bilateral contract.  I will hire you to do this job in return for that wage.  The worker is always free to quit if he disagrees with the arrangement.  Marx's exploitation theory is false.  Without workers to employ the capitalist will still be the most able to survive because he is the most resourceful and competent.  Without the capitalist to employ them, the workers would be impoverished; they are less able to survive on their own.  Their financial success depends on the productive ability of their employer.

Businessmen and entrepreneurs are very under-appreciated.  Yet, they are the source of wealth and prosperity in America--when they are left free to function by their government.  This is why a delimited and minimal government in accordance with our Constitution is so important.  Growth of government power directly reduces our prosperity.  It has been going on for so long that there is no wiggle room left.  Our economy will not ""come back"" until we reduce our government's power.  Government spending cannot be reduced until we reduce its size and power.

A nation's prosperity is proportional to its freedom.  Take a look at the world and you will see that all dictatorships are poor.  The most prosperous nations are semi-free (there are no free nations).  As Socialism continuously takes freedoms away from its people, the country falls into recessions and then into depressions.  The end result is an impoverished nation which cannot afford to pay ""entitlements"" to anyone.  Then, the meaning of Leon Trotsky's quote will become clear: ""Those who shall not toil, shall not eat.""  The fools who voted for free ice cream will be the most unemployable because they lack employable skills.  They will be the first to starve.",1436054400,12,4852,4.8785276073619634

6682842,5,B00NW6KRMA,"I did find this documentary entertaining - the dude had quite a Fonzy like look going on and I though it was funny how he begins by interviewing street performers in Hollywood.  Interesting sampling there...

When I want to call a documentary ""GOOD"".  -  I must briefly preface this with the fact that I do enjoy regularly watching political films in favor of either the current conservative OR progressive message.  For me, a good film may also make me curious enough to learn more about a topic and moreover; with further research, I may begin to ""sympathize"" with the films message.  But for this to happen, the film needs to collect sufficient, relevant, and accurate data supporting its claims and/or contain investigative reporting successfully uncovering new, reliable information.

This film unfortunately was a little light on data supporting the views presented but was focused more on citizen interviews. This was bolstered with the opinions of some conservative bloggers/experts such as Jack Cahill.

In short: The prevailing theory that progressives have a Utopia view of services the government should provide (maybe they do, maybe they don't), and that they believe an increase in social programs will create a better planet for everyone, isn't a perfect society in my opinion.  But this didn't seem to be only a Left view to me..

Messages from conservative politicians like:  ""I don't believe in the poor...I believe in the wealthy and soon to be wealthy""  is a statement infering that a lower class could potentially disappear is a view this is frankly,  just as misguided.

This film was off target to me because the ideas were just not supported with data, only other peoples opinions.  It would commonly show problems in communities and just say ""Progressives and their Utopia dream is causing this""  How? Don't just make claims, support them! Which policies are causing this and how did he identify the cause and effect relationship?

Interesting viewpoint but I did more research on my 3rd grade science project that this guy did for this film.  At the end of the day, this is just a editorial.",1435968000,4,2117,4.982905982905983

Even the few seconds worth of interviews with what appear to be serious sources of information (though I didn't recognize the names), provided no real information.

6682852,5,B00NW6KRMA,"For any media to communicate a message effectively to a large audience requires finding a commonly held belief, well known historical event , novel or film of which the Movie The Wizard of Oz probably stands near the pinnacle of well known ,widely translated and well revered books and films. Its theme is an adolescent dysphoric Dorothy stilted in a black and white world, whose dog Toto is to be taken from decides her only viable option is to run away from home.  transported to the Technicolor magical land..... you all know the story and that is the secret to this films success.
  The yellow brick road is the methphor in Gilbert's film for the road to progressivism (formerly known as communism)  to a fantasy Utopian world where by our troubles are resolved by the all powerful all knowing Wizard. Gilbert is systematic and carefully and slowly develops a clear analogy between the smoke and mirrors charlatan and prior totalitarians (Stalin, Hitler etc) whose promises from which deliverance is merely one more step away.
  Gilbert is effective delineating the various devices, the emotional allure of those whose only real purpose is control and power. Taking us to the promissory worlds created by progressives, communists and the Democratic machines of cities best exemplified by Detroit. It is unique in that it outlines this distinction clearly counterpoised with interviews with Daniel Horowitz (a red diaper baby himself ) , The Heritage foundation (after entering the building there is a memorable scene in which Joel Hugs a Artists rendition of Milton Friedman endearing him to free market acolytes everywhere I am certain).
  The beauty of this film is its a well thought out and carefully analyzed traipse along our own Yellow Brick Road. It requires someone who truly comprehends the problem and appreciates the solution to effectively communicate the differences between progressivism (communism - we should call it what it is) and our own America. There Is No Place Like Utopia is a must see film as a necessary journey to remind us of what we have and who, what and why it is under attack.
  Dorothy, in the movie, is fortunate in her Hero's Journey, to realize before becoming forever entrapped in, aperhaps interesting, but very foreign world that is OZ and realizes (with a prompt from the Carnival Barker formerly known as the Wizard) that she has the tools to bring her back to a world that she now appreciates more than ever.
  There are far worse places than Oz; the Gulags, Concentration Camps where those who do not comply with the transformative plans of political saviors are reeducated, from which extraction from imprisonment will require more than tapping ruby slippers and repeating there is no place like home. There is no place like home like America and appreciating it before the carnival barkers lead us into a brave new world from which there are no happy endings.

  Watch the movie and enjoy.  You will be entertained and will most likely pick up an appreciation or two or more along the way. All you need do is watch. The story is one that is not told enough.

I don't think he nor most of the ""experts"" he interviewed knew there was a difference between communism, socialism, and Marxism. He kind of mixed them all together without distinguishing any type of differences between them but did a good job convincing a 3rd grader or someone who thinks like one that it's all ""evil."" The filmmakers really forgot to list facts but then again what can you expect from someone who dresses like a slob? He also did a cheap and deceiving job with editing. The funniest was when he made Oprah look like an evil Stalin. It's hilarious how he blames the decline of Detroit solely on the left when in reality, it's been declining for many because most of the industrial jobs in Detroit that created a strong middle class have been shipped overseas. What can you really blame that on? Businesses that want to save money on labor?

Yeah... so I believe if you've been convinced that we should stay away from all of the liberal ideals just remember a purely capitalist society would mean you have to pay for everything even police service and ambulances.

When he compared what happened to Detroit to Obama's so-called social agenda, that was when he lost all credibility and I knew the rest of the movie would just be a waste of time.

Add to that the astounding level of racism in the film, I had to stop watching after about 70 minutes. He interviews blacks about their impoverished situation, but not a single poor white person, even though the data shows clearly that far more whites live in poverty than any minority.

I hope Joel makes a 3rd & 4th movie: How to Recover from Socialism ,  and How to Prevent Socialism.  But unfortunately, some things ARE true: USA has produced the most Billionaires on the planet Earth, yet people are living in abandoned buildings, hoping for scraps of food.
 Joel: YOU  got to help that Dorothy girl !
Help her get back to Utah, and not die in Hollywood.  Everyone knows what happens to poor girls in Hollywood.  If it ain't the drugs that kill them, it's the pornography & prostitution or fiends that prey upon innocent young girls.  That is a horrible thing, a bad end to someone's daughter...
This is worth viewing.  Dreams of my Real Father was better.
But what would Joel do to actually help America become hard working, productive, and strong once again ?
Criticism is the language of Cowards.
A real plan, that works, that solves problems: USA needs that.
What's your plan Mr. Gilbert ?

How can we turn arou d USA and prevent the growth of private prisons,
the federal prison labor camps prisoners enslaved work force?

What will stop the mass executions and economic genocide ?

Latinos made more babies than white people.
Catholics had big families,  and so do the Muslims.
They love God & Children.
They can flood the USA with over 100 million unemployed refugees.
What do you do with all of those people ?
Now robots & automation, self driving trucks,  & the Internet eliminate even
the low paying jobs illegals, & poor whites and blacks used to work.

6682946,2,B00NW6KRMA,"The philosophy behind the film, the general message and presuppositions undergirding it - that's what I want to engage here.

I used to be a conservative. Over a decade or so, I became a moderate who saw much more value and effectiveness in a position that embraced the best of libertarian, conservative and liberal perspectives and policies. Extreme conservativism has been dominating a lot of political decisions in America since Reagan (whom I agree and disagree with on various points). It's gone much far. Extreme libertarianism is a mythology of unending freedom disconnected from the realities of how human psychology, economics, natural resource management and sociology work. Extreme liberalism can create the kinds of communist societies that Fox News tells us every day are encroaching or have already ingrained themselves in American life. The word ""fearmongering"" may get thrown around too often for some people's tastes, but some or a lot of it is going on here.

In contrast to those over-the-top narratives listed above, the data I've found in the past several years show that generally the more conservative and religious a Western nation or US state is - the greater their social ills (murder, rape, abortion, income inequality, Quality of Life index, obesity, infant mortality, environmental abuse, CEO to average worker pay, teen pregnancy, minimum worker benefits, incarceration rate, pornography usage).

I also think it's very important to point out how many political analysts have made strong cases for the repeated alignment in Obama's policies, speeches and actions with moderate Republicans such as Einsenhower, Nixon and Ford.

I encourage anyone out there who disbelieves this premise to type ""obama moderate republican"" in a Google search and see what a wide range of commentators are presenting evidence for it. One example is an October 2014 article in ""The American Conservative"" by Bruce Bartlett called ""Obama Is a Republican"". The caption below the title says, ""He's the heir to Richard Nixon, not Saul Alinsky."" I've copied the first few paragraphs below. After that, on the web page, he goes through the details supporting his position - covering Iraq/Afghanistan/ISIS, stimulus/deficit, health reform, drugs, national-security leaks, race, gay marriage and corporate profits.

Back in 2008, Boston University professor Andrew Bacevich wrote an article for this magazine making a conservative case for Barack Obama. While much of it was based on disgust with the warmongering and budgetary profligacy of the Republican Party under George W. Bush, which he expected to continue under 2008 Republican nominee Sen. John McCain, Bacevich thought Obama at least represented hope for ending the Iraq War and shrinking the national-security state.

I wrote a piece for the New Republic soon afterward about the Obamacon phenomenon-prominent conservatives and Republicans who were openly supporting Obama. Many saw in him a classic conservative temperament: someone who avoided lofty rhetoric, an ambitious agenda, and a Utopian vision that would conflict with human nature, real-world barriers to radical reform, and the American system of government.

Among the Obamacons were Ken Duberstein, Ronald Reagan's chief of staff; Charles Fried, Reagan's solicitor general; Ken Adelman, director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency for Reagan; Jeffrey Hart, longtime senior editor of National Review; Colin Powell, Reagan's national security adviser and secretary of state for George W. Bush; and Scott McClellan, Bush's press secretary. There were many others as well.

According to exit polls in 2008, Obama ended up with 20 percent of the conservative vote. Even in 2012, after four years of relentless conservative attacks, he still got 17 percent of the conservative vote, with 11 percent of Tea Party supporters saying they cast their ballots for Obama.

They were not wrong. In my opinion, Obama has governed as a moderate conservative-essentially as what used to be called a liberal Republican before all such people disappeared from the GOP. He has been conservative to exactly the same degree that Richard Nixon basically governed as a moderate liberal, something no conservative would deny today. (Ultra-leftist Noam Chomsky recently called Nixon ""the last liberal president."")",1424390400,4,4374,5.5344311377245505

6682971,5,B00NW6KRMA,"I recommend the movie.  I especially appreciate that the film was balanced; however, showing the reason why socialism does not work.  When listening to the Progressive, I was taken aback by how hateful they are toward Americans, especially the older generations of the Can-Do Americans.  That offended me a lot to have the Trust-fund-babies like Billy-Bomb Ayres, all with their PhDs in I Am Smatter Than Thou brats, discuss how evil our Country is and they have to fix it.  Literally, they planned the dumb-downing of those that could be and to eliminate those that were too smart or non-followers.  And, they were successful.  When looking at Education, it started at the elite, Ivy Universities.  Not, this is shoved down our kids throats in the first grade!

This is not a birther-film:  not sure where that comment/opinion came from in the film and it is not one-sided except in the conclusion that when one believes in making their own opportunities, that fares better in life.  But, it was VERY sad how single Moms, the poor all get trapped and dependent on assistance.  The system appears to be set up to make it almost impossible to leave the system:  no way to find a job in some of these communities - Detroit is a 3rd-world slum!!  Shocking and very, very sad that our fellow citizens are living in this...  ??  It looks like a back street in Rio.

This is a hard movie for me to say, I really enjoyed this, but it is eye-opening and honest. Near the end, Gilbert is talking to his Mom and she refusing to engage in discussing politics!  She finally reminds him that she is not liberal or conservative:  ""I'm in the Middle!""  Funny, that is how I used to be and I think most Americans.  It is always had to be a neighbor, friend and fellow American suffer, truly suffer and not someone just using the system.  And the last 100 years we have gone backwards (or Forward) closer toward socialism.  Then you see the faces, people that have been ""touched"" by this socialism - that part is very difficult and it does inspire, We Gotta Do Something!  Not the government, we do.

Levin's book is a lot deeper than 'There's No Place Like Utopia', but presents the same facts and history, but gives the reader a lot of background. The movie compliments the book.

The on-the-street 'There's No Place Like Utopia' interviews are entertaining and informative. The sit-down interviews are more serious and provide a great deal of information and history, that just isn't talked about these days.

This was the same time Cuba was also fighting for independence against colonial Spain. The USA took power away from the people their also but they didn't get anything in return like the Puerto Ricans did. This allowed Puerto Ricans to have American citizenship.
