2555869,5,B000F9T71O,"Gene is special!! I'm a new Jiu-Jitsu Practitioner and have looked at Books and DVD's extesively to supplement my training including stuff from Wally Jay.
I find this DVD very true to life inclding the breakfalls (which I had a few issues with initially).
I still look at other stuff now but always go back to Gene to smooth out any rough edges.
The Guy (and his team) have done a masterful job.
I'm hooked.",1182038400,3,407,4.44
2555870,5,B000F9T71O,"I think it's a great DVD, for both, beginners as well as advanced students who are looking to improve the technicality. I was preparing for a tournament and watching this DVD helped me in adjusting some of my finishing techniques.

I surely recommend this DVD, and I would look to buy more with the same instructor",1179100800,4,314,4.607142857142857
2555871,5,B000F9T71O,"This is the best BJJ DVD. The others have problems with teacher accents that make some of them incomprehensible; poor sound\micing, or horrible camera work.  But Simco is a well spoken individual, who looks right at the camera and teaches as if you are standing there.  Also, the bottom of the screen has occasional written hints, that help.  Simco seems genuinely concernd with you the student, you really feel he is ther teaching you.  His moves are patiently explained.",1173484800,5,472,4.936708860759493
2555872,5,B000F9T71O,"Anything by this man is good.

Gene Simco is a genius at teaching the grappling arts!!!!!

Watching it I felt as though he was teaching me personally. I am not kidding about what I am about to say,.........I sat there and mouthed out loud questions that a few seconds later he answered. What I am trying to say is that he is so in touch with what the student's queries because he keeps in touch with the student within himself.

This man is a true teacher and a great grappler. If you are interested in grappling, this is the DVD for you.

You cannot lose!!!!!!",1170288000,15,561,4.314285714285714
2555873,5,B000F9T71O,"The BJJ DVD from Gene Simco is great for beginners' students who don't have the time to train all the time and no time for private classes. With this DVD you can take the time to review step by step to see how the positions work - also, what I like a lot about this video is that Simco details each technique (Attack Order, Pressure, Angles, Tightness, Application, Timing,) with great explanation, making each movement easy to understand.

 I was highly impressed with his ability to explain key points that stuck with me as I hit the mat and for any bjj student, to come home after a hard night rolling and pick up this DVD will certainly improve your game and help piece together the parts of your jiu jitsu puzzle.  This DVD is sure to add to your game...",1164067200,23,759,4.368794326241135
2555884,1,B000F9T71O,I ordered this video and the first time it shipped it was missing disc one of the two dvd set.  I sent it back and they shipped it again.  Guess what....missing disc one again.  Very frustrating.  Cancelled my order altogether and sent it back.,1239148800,2,244,4.4772727272727275
2555885,3,B000F9T71O,"Very informative and well done, but it seems like a two disc movie and i have only disc 2. The package is misleading it seems that two discs are included. I would like to find disc 1. Still worth the buy.",1238889600,,204,4.0
2555886,4,B000F9T71O,"Hi,

Bought the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu- Ultimate winning techniques remeber a couple of things i used to know and i liked a lot. I can recomend this one.",1231459200,,150,4.357142857142857
2555887,5,B000F9T71O,"This set is just a bargain, pure and simple. Solid fundamentals with lots of great detail. No frills or fancy graphics
just great instruction. May seem a little plodding at first, but I keep returning to it. I learn more every time I watch it.",1224028800,2,243,4.4222222222222225
2555888,5,B000F9T71O,"Gene Simco's two-disc DVD is an excellent 'how-to' introductory course for beginners in the art of submission fighting. This can be a quality vehicle in doing homework between classes and may even give you an edge in preparing for classes or competition. Simco has a great teaching style and takes his time in demonstrating the holds, takedowns, escapes and grappling sequences from a variety of angles. He packs more information into this 200-minute DVD than many instructors cover in three months of classes.

Intermediate fighters will also find this useful for review and even exploring topics that may have been briefly discussed or overlooked. For advanced fighters, there is little more than review except for the end of Disc Two where some good tips are available in 'chain' techniques and ground maneuvering.

Again, students from beginner to intermediate will benefit from this high quality course offered at a bargain price.",1215043200,5,935,5.226666666666667
2555889,5,B000F9T71O,This DVD offers fantastic qualilty instruction.  Very detailed.  You can't go wrong for the price.,1208390400,2,98,5.466666666666667
2555890,5,B000F9T71O,"I haven't actually bought this particular DVD set. But I do have Gene Simco's 4 DVD Set, ""Essential Techniques.""  Looking at the description and video preview for this DVD at the producers' website, this set seems to be one and the same.  I paid $100 for my set at Simco's site, so at Amazon, this is a steal.  I thought I would pass along this information so people don't spend more than they need to.

As far as the DVD set, this set is basically a companion to Simco's beginner book, ""Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu Basics"".  He goes over the basic foundational techniques that you will use to build into some of the most advanced techniques in BJJ.  I second the notion that it seems like you are almost there in class with Gene.  The camera angles are great and what makes Gene stand out as an instructor are the way he puts the what seem to be complex techniques into the simplest terms.  This makes it very easy to go from the explanation to the application.

The set goes over:

Standing techniques: Basic standing technique, closing the distance, takedowns from the clinch and when your opponent is behind you.

Attacks from the top: Guard passing, hold downs, submissions from the top and back.

The Guard: Sweeps, submissions, arm locks and chokes.  The three pillars of guard submission (Triangle, arm lock, omoplata) and combinations.

Escapes and Leg locks: Escape from the pin, leg locks and leg lock escapes.

For what it's worth.",1200787200,5,1435,4.684
2555891,3,B000F9T71O,"I found this to be a great instructional DVD. The techniques he showed were not unlike other DVD's, however with each technique he shows a slight twist here or angle change there that can mean the difference between a really tight inescapable lock to a loose one. These small differrences make a big differrence.
The only negative thing I would say is he waffles on a bit. He introduces too many concepts while trying to demonstrate the basic technique. It would be easier to grasp if the basic technique was introduced first, then show the finer points and variations of the basic. It leaves you thinking ""come on, get on with it"" a lot. But the actual techniques are great.",1198195200,10,675,4.633333333333334
2555892,5,B000F9T71O,"This product was a steal for the price!  I ordered the Gracie method, which is excellent, but I think they spend too much time going over the ""fine details"" of each move on that video series---it is so drawn out it gets boring to watch!  This video is right to the point.  The moves are clearly demonstrated, but there isn't so much talking and they don't do the same thing over and over so many times (isn't that what a rewind button is for?).  If you master all the moves on this video, you could probably at least be ready for the blue belt test in jiu jitsu at most schools.  They do a drill alternating between the triangle choke, arm bar, etc. (3 moves---can't spell the 3rd one!)---my teacher surprised us all by throwing that very drill on our belt test...I was ready for it because of these videos (we never did it in class).  I would definitely buy the intermediate/advanced videos if/when available.  I hope this helps.",1193702400,10,930,4.4674556213017755
2555893,5,B000F9T71O,"Great purchase. It is worth its weight in gold! If you are a novice or a pro, there is something in this set for you.",1185667200,3,117,3.72
8119386,1,B000F9T71O,"Didn't like it at all ... Couldn't even get through 10 minutes of it... Tried multiple times. I have a lot of bjj DVDs... I got something useful out of all my DVDs  ... This is the worst jiu jitsu  instructional dvd I have ever seen in my life. I don't even want to get into why because I don't even know where to start... I can't say one positive thing.

But I  got it for $1 or something like that  so it doesn't matter... I put it in the trash because that's what this  dvd is.",1441152000,,480,3.8969072164948453
8119387,5,B000F9T71O,Gene is 100% on point with this instructional video. Very good for learning and studying a practical application of fundamental jiu jitsu.,1407974400,,138,5.318181818181818
8119388,5,B000F9T71O,"Comprehensive! Having just started my Brazilian Jujitsu training its good to have a reference for the basics, for the price and content you cannot do any better than this set. Mr. Simco has put together all the info you'll need to cover the ground game as a white belt and at a very noticeable price difference compared to some of the other programs out there. Very good!",1394150400,,371,4.552238805970149
8119389,4,B000F9T71O,"I am new to BJJ...so I was looking for a cheap DVD (I can't buy anything too expensive or my wife will start to rag and I will eventually end up throwing her down a flight of stairs - I bought a house with a set of stairs solely for this reason.) that would give you the basics of the sport...I thought the dvd gave me a good, simple overview into BJJ...",1273795200,2,354,3.9305555555555554
8119390,3,B000F9T71O,"This DVD (3) to be exact has some good points and intruction, its just cheaply made and the intructor is one of the worst sites on camera.  I could have made a better production with a retro 80's camera and a VHS player on EP mode, just rubbish.  I found myself laughing more than I was paying attention, I had to go back and watch it a few times to get past it.  I would recommend the BJ Penn MMA book on here, at least that won't have you laughing.",1266451200,2,450,3.977777777777778
8119391,5,B000F9T71O,"This dvd offers ""winning techniques"" as described in the title. The information is easy to follow and techniques are thorough. I highly recommend this dvd for beginners to intermediate looking to review structured techniques.",1264032000,,225,5.647058823529412
8119392,1,B000F9T71O,"I ordered this product and it was missing a DVD too.  I am not sure how to contact the seller for my other DVD but not worth the hassle of only getting Disc 2.
DON'T BUY THIS DVD",1254700800,2,178,3.6842105263157894
8119393,4,B000F9T71O,"I think that this DVD is not about Ultimate Winning Techniques, it is more about Beginner MMA information. If you really want to learn MMA go to a local MMA training complex. If you have never been, this DVD can help you in getting a step up on some of the basics before taking classes.

With that said, it is easy to understand and follow along on the DVD. Simco goes over information slowly, but that is what you want to pound it in your head and understand the movements. Good for beginners, and if you are wondering whether you would like to take the next step and join MMA classes and learn some defense. It is also cheap. I think I am going to make my next investment in Mario Sperry's Vale Tudo 3.",1241222400,2,704,4.214814814814815
8119394,1,B000F9T71O,"The instruction that Gene Simco gives is very good, but this product is not what is advertised.  I too am missing DVD 1.  The cover shows moves being done on DVD 1, and it isn't even included!  The remaining 90 minutes on DVD 2 is excellent.",1240531200,3,241,4.195652173913044
8119395,1,B000F9T71O,I ordered this twice and each time it was missing Disc one!  What gives???,1239321600,,74,4.285714285714286
