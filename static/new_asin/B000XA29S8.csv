8227624,5,B000XA29S8,"""A Girl in Australia"" was filmed around Cairns, Mossman, Port Douglas and Innisfail in North Queensland in about 1969/1970 (released in 1970). I have heard of this film for some years, but until I found it through Amazon, I had not seen it. Unfortunately, the only copies available are from Italy and there are no subtitles. However, it is a credit to director Mario Zampi and his expressive leading actors, Alberto Sordi and Claudia Cardinale, that the film is easy to watch, understand and enjoy without subtitles. I'm sure the one-liners would be funny. There is English spoken in some scenes.
The somewhat lonely and not especially handsome Alberto Sordi uses the photo of a friend to attract a bride from Italy. The exquisitely beautiful Claudia Cardinale, eager to get out of Italy, flies to Australia. She is not altogether happy about being duped, but they are thrown together on a road trip where, for the most part, they argue like lovers.
This is a romantic comedy that will engage you from beginning to end. It is a nice companion piece to ""They're a Weird Mob"" starring Walter Chiari that was filmed in Sydney a couple of years earlier by Michael Powell.
Familiar Aussie faces in the cast include Cul Cullen and Noel Ferrier.
Warning: This film will give you the impression that Uluru, Broken Hill, Brisbane, Gold Coast and North Queensland can be visited all in one day. No way. It would take days, maybe a couple of weeks to travel such vast distances. It is good to look back at what Queensland looked like in  1970.",1291161600,2,1532,4.7164179104477615
