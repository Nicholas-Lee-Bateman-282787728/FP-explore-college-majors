8034155,4,B0002XL2U2,DVD at Betamax Quality.  but its 80s.  what can you expect,1513382400,,58,4.181818181818182
8034156,3,B0002XL2U2,"It seems that fans of this 70s anime come bred into two schools of thought: old-school heads who are fans of the Americanized 'Battle of the Planets' version, or more hardcore anime cultists who swear by the original and uncut 'Gatchaman' version. Having had the chance to enjoy both, I find both versions to have their own charm and merit.  I also grew up with the BOTP version, and did not see Gatchaman(sp?) until I was in my early 40s.  BEST OF G-FORCE presents re-dubbed English-speaking versions of 7 of the uncut Gatchaman episodes (though I question whether I'd consider these seven eps among the ""best"" of the series. But when you've got over 150 eps from which to choose and a limited amount of time in which to do it, you grab what's closest and get to work.)  It has been hard for me to find ANY G-Force DVD material for under $30, so this might be a decent investment.  The episodes on here were fun, though I will warn any younger anime fans reading this that you will find the animation style VERY DATED by modern standards.  This is good old-fashioned fun. If you're my age, it's something cool to show your kids.",1383696000,4,1129,4.487804878048781
8034157,5,B0002XL2U2,"Been trying to find this cartoon for some time. Although I would like more episodes, having some is better than none. Quick purchase to rec'd turn around and product was in excellent condition with no problems when viewed. Was very glad to see the episodes selected were some of more important ones regarding the history of the team. Still amazed by the creativity of the vehicles in the show (the good guys, not the animal/insect like machines).",1317945600,2,446,4.805194805194805
8034158,1,B0002XL2U2,"I was very disappointed in this DVD because I mistakenly though that it was the ""Battle of the Planets"" G-Force that I grew up with (with 7-Zark-7, Mark, Jason, Princess, Keyop, Tiny, & Zoltar).  It was not.  Mark was called ""Ace Goodheart"", Jason was called ""Dirk Daring"", and so on.  7-Zark-7 was not even in it.  I threw the DVD away; it was worthless to me.  Just know what you're getting into before you purchase it, which I should have done.  No one's fault but my own - I believe the information was listed, but I either chose to ignore it or didn't read it at all, can't remember.  I believe the DVD contains 7 episodes.  Oh yeah, different voices for the characters too, not Casey Kasem, et al.",1283731200,25,703,4.395348837209302
8034159,1,B0002XL2U2,"I'm sure i would have loved this DVD if not for the terrible new Dubbing and character names cmon!!! Dirk Daring and Pee Wee what the heck is going on!! please don't market this to Nick at night kids and screw up a classic. If you gotta buy a Gforce DVD try to get the original Ninja Science team or Gatcha man before you buy this watered down crap, if your old enough to remember the voices and character names stay away from this sell out garbage.",1122163200,18,449,4.172413793103448
8034160,5,B0002XL2U2,"Man I remember watching this when I was 4. My favorite was Aggie she kicked ass man! I hope Rhino release more G-Force Episodes or hopefully a box set. I'm dying to see The Fatal Flowers again because the Battle Of The Planets version sucked, it didn't show no action when Princess was fighting the plants. Also Best Of G-Force focused on Ace. PLEASE RHINO RELEASE MORE G-FORCE!!",1114732800,8,379,4.588235294117647
8034161,2,B0002XL2U2,"This DVD really deserve a 1 star but the anime is so GREAT and CLASSIC. WHY,WHY!!? Why not the spanish audio or the french or portuguese? This is the kind of anime that many people were raised on! I was raised with G-Force when I was a kid and it was so special to me that I want to hear it again in my language (me and many other people).

The DVD of Battle of the Planets contains one bonus G-Force episodes in english, spanish and portuguese on each volume. At least that make me feel happy, but it would be so much better if this DVD contained the multiple languages and for those who want to see the original episodes in english and japanese then they would buy the Battle of the Plantets collection without the multiple languages. THAT WOULD BE SO MUCH BETTER!!!!!!!!

P.S: I hope that people agree with me. It doesn't matter if we are in America, many minorities live here and that is great for the movie market and this dvds are also selling in many hispanic countries. And another thing: I don't like the english voices in G-Force, I would rather hear it in japanese.

ADIOS!",1111795200,6,1084,4.356435643564357
