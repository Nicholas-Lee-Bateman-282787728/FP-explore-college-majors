7928594,5,B00004ZESP,"The story takes place in old Jerusalem and involves a Sephardic couple deeply in love.  Rebecca, the wife, is troubled by the fact that she cannot have children and managed to convince her reticent husband, who is a Rabbi, to take a second, younger wife so as to have an heir.  Rebecca felt that she was doing a good deed for her husband and for the younger woman, who was recently orphaned of her father.  The younger woman held Rebecca in great esteem and finally agreed to the marriage.

Through no fault of the younger woman, Rebecca found herself plagued by jealousy and misunderstanding.  In the end, Rebecca realized that she created her own demons and also learned that her co-wife is with child.  All ends well.

The human then predictably intervenes, disrupting with emotional turmoil the would-be sublime gift.",1073347200,9,436,4.905405405405405
