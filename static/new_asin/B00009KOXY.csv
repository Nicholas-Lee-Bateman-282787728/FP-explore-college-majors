7991162,5,B00009KOXY,"I bought the If Only dvd from a Russian website one year ago. I have since watched it 26 times. One of the most heartfelt and romantic tearjerkers I have ever seen. It makes me cry like a baby everytime.

Love is so amazingly beautiful and talented. She wrote both of the (oscar worthy) songs that she sings in this movie.

Definately not to be missed.",1140912000,,352,4.318181818181818
7991163,4,B00009KOXY,"Four previous films have dealed with this similar subject: Dead again with Kenneth Branagh, Groundhob day of Harold Raimis, Butterfly effect and Sliding doors of Sidney Pollack.

Jennifer Love Hewitt and Paul Nichols make a perfect team in this poignant story. If you remind for instance, the dramatic crossroad that occurs with the tragedy of Verona ` s lovers you might interweave very fine and establish a certain relationship with the butterfly effect in which a simple fact becomes the spark of a set of overlapped events that eventually, lead to a fixed result in a sort o inexorable  whirlwind that apparently was nourished by random facts but that maintain an incorporeal straightness, no matter what you strive to change some parameters. Under this premise of somber fatalisms unfolds this single but well built script with overindulgent episodes that tend to minimize the emotional burden. Jennifer exhibits her charisma and sympathy that constitutes a suggestive hook for the viewer.

 What if you had the gift to change the awesome call of the destiny? Must we accept beforehand the call of the fate far beyond our will? Or on the contrary are we simple circular puppets, hoping to be called? Is the love a natural force strong enough to face that premise?

The nature of life itself, has to be realized in acts of life. In this sense, it would seem the destiny, considered barely as a conjunction of spattered events, has inside its perpetual transformation and only allows itself certain concessions with strong wills.  Wilkinson is superb in his secondary role.

Many questions to solve, many items to discuss after the show is gone.",1138492800,,1648,4.992700729927007
7991164,4,B00009KOXY,"This is hardly an original movie, let's start with that.  Then again, what was the last truly original movie you've seen?  Now that we got that out of the way, let's agree that you either love sappy romances that have that ""if only"" element attached to it or hate them.

This movie is in the vain of such films as ""Family Man"" and Chances Are.""  Jennifer Love Hewitt is ""Samantha"" an American living in London with her boyfriend, ""Ian"" (played by Paul Nicholls).  Ian is absorbed in his work, not being the boyfriend he could/should be.  When Samantha dies in an auto accident, Ian is racked with guilt...until a cab driver makes possible the opportunity to relive the last day they spent together.
Well, suffice to say, having the chance to do it all over again, Ian is everything he wasn't the first time around.  But yet little things throughout the day seem to indicate that no matter what happens, the day will end with Samantha dying.  Unless....

I can't spoil it for those who haven't yet seen it.  There will be tissues and there will be tears.  It isn't anything you probably haven't seen before, but it works like a charm this time.

Jennifer Love Hewitt really should be the go-to girl for romantic movies.  She has the girl next door appeal that woman don't find threatening and men find attainable (think Meg Ryan). And, yes, women will swoon over Ian.

From what I've been able to gather, this movie was released overseas theatrically, but was only on ABC Family in the United States.  The fact that Amazon has it listed probably means there is a DVD release in the future and this one is well worth owning.",1138233600,2,1622,4.56401384083045
