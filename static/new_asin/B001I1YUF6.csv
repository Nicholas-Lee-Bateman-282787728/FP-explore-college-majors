8310344,5,B001I1YUF6,I love Sarah Geronimo's music. Now i can say i like her acting as well. She has natural acting ability that shows up in the form of subtle facial expressions in many scenes that i think would be hard to teach. This is not only a love story. It's also a story about a young mans struggle to gain full acceptance by his family. John Lloyd Cruz's character's abrassiveness in the movie is the result of that struggle. The scene at his mother's gravesite with his father was especially moving. How his character changes throughout the movie and series from finding love is the most interesting aspect.  Highly recommend this movie.,1413763200,,627,4.648648648648648
