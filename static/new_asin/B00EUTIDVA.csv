8609633,4,B00EUTIDVA,"This movie was very different from the usual Bollywood fare.  There were no rousing song and dance numbers by the cast.  Instead, they had the kids go to a nightclub a couple of times and the music at the club and the kids dancing is how they got the song and dance in.  Gotta love Bollywood's dedication to music.  None of the actors and actresses are known to me.  The girls and boy who played Tanisha, Anu, Ashwin, and Nidhi all look as though they are 16.  There is no specific plot other than to illustrate the lives of well to do sixteen year olds in Delhi.  To me, they all acted like privileged American teenagers.  They had way more disposable income from their parents than they should have.  They had way too much freedom to do as they pleased.  They acted as if they knew everything and owned the world.  Having said all that, they were not hateful characters.  They each ended up having their challenges.  I did not appreciate the director misleading the viewer into thinking one of the main characters was (maybe) a pedophile.  The acting was pretty good and  the ending was satisfying.  I recommend this movie.",1399161600,,1125,4.522388059701493
