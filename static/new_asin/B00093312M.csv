Red Ryder began as a newspaper comic strip around 1937 and lasted until 1964. Many comic strips from that time are also gone. These two movies show how some people try to swindle other out of their lands. Red Ryder helps the people to overcome these schemes. The Johnson County War in 1892 Wyoming inspired many stories where a big corporation tried to swindle people out of their homesteads so they could be taken by the big corporation. Read the individual reviews for more information.

Stagecoach to Denver from 1946 tells how a new land survey can create changed boundaries to enrich one land owner and swindle others out of their land.

Stagecoach to Denver is from a soft 16mm dupe print which has some segments that are very dark. However, it will suffice for viewing on a small, regular television screen. Don't bother watching on an HD screen.

Homesteaders of Paradise Valley is from a substandard 16mm dupe print which is soft but has much surface noise and flickering white horizontal lines. Also, some outdoor scenes are very dark. The soundtrack has an intermittent hum. Overall, this is fair to poor.

These are available on Amazon for $2.60 with shipping. I think that is too much. If you can find this at a Dollar store, it is worth a dollar but not more. If you have low standards, you will not be disappointed.

Cascadia seems to be like Alpha: sometimes they manage to obtain a good print but most of the time they use whatever they can get for little money.",1173052800,,1001,4.76878612716763
