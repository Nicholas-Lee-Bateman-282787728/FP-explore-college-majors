8223116,5,B000WFSLEU,This is the best Arturo Sandoval  DVD out there. I saw him perform on the 2013 Jazz Cruise---he does it all brilliantly!,1388707200,,120,4.454545454545454
8223117,2,B000WFSLEU,"Arturo Sandoval is a great trumpet player....his mastery of the instrument is unbelievable!  However, this performance really left me cold.  The very first song on the DVD is the best thing on the recording.  He has great ""licks"" that he has mastered; however, I have heard all of them before.  His solos really don't build or tell a story, it's all pyrotechnics, i.e. higher, louder, faster.

I got to hear him years ago with the Cuban group Irakere at the North Sea Jazz Festival, and his playing moved me!  I saw him live in West Berlin at the Quasimodo club and was totally blown away!  I also have the DVD that he plays with Dizzy in London.....fantastic!  This DVD is a real disappointment and I cannot recommend it.",1314489600,,722,4.5859375
8223118,5,B000WFSLEU,"The best trumpet player in the world sizzles in this fine DVD. Arturo fills the room with infectuous Latin energy that makes you want to get up and dance. He may be getting older, but like fine wine, he is also getting better.",1214352000,,226,4.27906976744186
8223119,5,B000WFSLEU,"There is only one Arturo Sandoval! This is a fantastic Live Performance DVD of one of the most exciting Trumpet Players, in the entire history of the trumpet. Arturo is also a very gifted Jazz Pianist, Keyboard player, Latin percussionist, vocalist, and he's also a great entertainer, who loves to play for his audience. His goal is to play the highest caliber of music, and to play for the audience, the people, who he truly loves. Nothing but great music, and great entertainment. The entire concert is first class in every way, all styles of Jazz performance. Arturo's marvelous band, is filled with some of the finest musicians anywhere in the world, and they play a concert that will leave you speechless, playing a variety of styles, and musical emotions.
I can't recommend this DVD highly enough.",1214352000,3,803,4.868613138686132
8223120,5,B000WFSLEU,"""For pure entertainment, it's hard to beat the ebullient Cuban.""

Well said, but awesome seems to sum it up in one word!",1214352000,,120,4.454545454545454
8223121,5,B000WFSLEU,as a new jazz fan this dvd seems like the real thing...he reminds me of dizzy...and his band seemed young....like he might be....mentoring/teaching....wish i played an instrument like that!,1214265600,,189,5.551724137931035
8223122,3,B000WFSLEU,"I have been a fan of Arturo for almost 15 years now, and the last couple of years, his playing and compositions have become boring. He has not the fire anymore, the soul is gone, and the arrangments are sad. I think that is very sad, because he used to be an AWESOME trumpeter. I don't think he practice so much these days. But, its always fun to listen to him, a good buy for fans..:-)",1205280000,,386,4.092105263157895
8223123,5,B000WFSLEU,"Arturo is an awesome talent, and this DVD proves it.  His band put in a strong performance as well.  I was expecting to see Arturo playing trumpet on a collection of Latin Jazz numbers, but this is much more than a Latin Jazz DVD.  They play a wide range of great music, and Arturo plays a variety of instruments masterfully, and he even dances a bit.  And the DVD includes a wonderful new song ""Oscar.""  The interview with Arturo is interesting too, with plenty of insights.",1203120000,2,475,4.476744186046512
8223124,5,B000WFSLEU,"Nice video and audio recording. This man is amazing....he can play a wide variety of instruments, and he sounds great on all of them. Talk about an exciting performance! I can't think of another musician who knows his instrument better. This will make a great xmas gift.",1196726400,,270,4.76595744680851
