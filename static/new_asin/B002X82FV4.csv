8383510,2,B002X82FV4,"This is super outdated, I believe it was put together in 2001 and published in 2003, it might have been a good software back then but don't rely on this if you are preparing for the California real estate exam Salesperson or Broker. Besides the fact that every single practice test is full of repeated questions from the other practice test (which shows that people putting this together didn't want to do a quality thorough job) plus syntax errors after grammatical errors in the same sentence :)  I personally used the California Real Estate Ultimate Prep Exam, it's the most up to date software available out there published by interactivetestprep.com I prepared with the Ultimate Prep Exam software for the salesperson couple years ago and passed easily and got the Ultimate Prep Exam broker software recently and got ready in less than a month and took the broker exam in La Palma, CA recently and passed with flying colors! CONGRATULATION to me !! :) alright back to the review:
I know for a fact that the Real Estate Law  and regulations change constantly and if the publisher  doesn't keep up with those changes, their test prep material is useless because you will face questions about those new laws and regulations in the exam that you won't have a clue on what to answer, I give you couple examples here, if you see a test prep material that still mentions the term ""DRE"" or "" Department of Real Estate"" it is a sign that it is kinda outdated because it's been almost 3 years that in California, the Department of Real Estate has changed its name to the Bureau of Real Estate and it reflects in all the new regulations and documentations released and published by them, you now need to know the terms ""Bureau"" or ""California Bureau of Real Estate"" ""CalBRE"" there are many many other examples like this, like I have seen in most outdated test prep material, many questions about how a broker has to get an approval for advanced fee for loan modification or mortgage loan forbearance services, how long he has to do so and what form he has to fill out and send to get the commissioner's approval etc..Well guess what, this question is so outdated that the law has completely changed since 2009 and this practice in now completely illegal, a real estate licensee is prohibited by law to charge an advanced fee for mortgage loan modification services.. anyway you get the point, prepare for the exam with materials that are constantly up-to-date so you don't fail the exam and waste more time and money in fees, Good Luck to everyone!",1446681600,6,2542,4.682326621923937
8383511,1,B002X82FV4,I did not buy this of Amazon however I unfortunately paid my real estate school $150 to WATCH this video.  I was extremely disappointed with the videos content and the teachers monotone voice and I failed my state test to boot.,1438560000,4,227,4.536585365853658

8383513,1,B002X82FV4,"This is one of the worst presentations I have ever watched. The so called course consists of a monotone gentleman lecturing in front of a podium for hours on end. No visuals, now writing on a chalk board, no graphics of any kind, nothing but him standing there lecturing in that flat monotonous voice.",1347148800,7,301,4.592592592592593
8383514,5,B002X82FV4,"This is a good method of helping you prepare for the California Real Estate Sales or Broker's Exam. There are more than ""14 hours"" of review in this 4-DVD set. Since the year ""2004"" ALL Allied Exam Cram Review Videos and Matching Fill-In-The-Blank Workbooks have been scripted by Dwight Norris, the instructor, to be compatible.
