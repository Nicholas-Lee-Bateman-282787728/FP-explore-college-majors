1358784,4,B00004VVPG,"We are and English-speaking household but I try to provide a lot of Spanish exposure for my kids to start them learning.  This one hasn't been quite as popular with my kids as some others (Baby Einstein, Mozart Numbers & Shapes), but I like it a lot and think it will grow on them as they learn more Spanish.  The thing I like about this one is that it introduces sentences and not just individual words.  It speaks the Spanish word with a real-life picture to teach the work, and repeats with several different images.  It then puts words together and says the whole Spanish.  For example, it will go over ""dog"" and ""play"" and ""ball"", and then do ""the dog plays with the ball"".  The images are attractive and catch kids' interest, the Spanish words and spoken by a soothing female voice, and the background music is pleasant.  In short, painless Spanish education appropriate for young and very young children.",1009756800,15,911,4.62111801242236
1358785,5,B00004VVPG,"I'm a speech and langauge therapist who works with early chilhood and elementary level children. I'm also the mother of a 13 month boy.
The vocabulary and grammatical structures are very appropriate for little language learners. The simplicity, repetitiveness, and predictability are idea for learning a second language.
My baby really likes it too. It really holds his attention.
5 stars!",1005955200,8,389,5.39344262295082
1358786,5,B00004VVPG,"This is my 3 year old son's favorite video.  He requests ""spanish"" before Thomas the Tank engine.  Today he asked me for a manzana (apple) for lunch! (which prompted me to write this review)
The video covers numbers 1-10, colors, and some basic nouns and verbs.  Basic sentences using the vocabulary words are also presented.  The video is set to instrumental music, mostly classical.  The video uses real children and objects as opposed to cartoons.  This aspect particularly engages my child.
Though this certainly won't make your child bilingual, it is a great introduction to another language.  I wish the producers would do an additional spanish volume!",1002844800,20,658,5.093457943925234
1358787,5,B00004VVPG,"I have twin gilrs who are 19 months old and it's difficult for them to sit through a video besides seasame street. When I put the Bilingual video on for them they loved it I have never seen them so interested in what they were watching before, I was amazed and even more so when one of the girls woke up the next morning and repeated a phrase she had heard. Being hispanic I am teaching them both languages. I highly recommend this video for parents and children who want to learn. It's educational without being boring. Gotta get it !",1001203200,,535,4.306930693069307
1358788,5,B00004VVPG,"This video is a must have.  The music and colorful images are alone worth the price of the video.  Best of all, any child that watches this video (provided that they are of speaking age) will pick up some Spanish from the very first viewing.  Big bonus-it's just as much fun for the parents to watch!  My two year old and I make this video selection part of our regular viewing.  I'm very discriminating about what she watches on television and put everything through a vigorous screening process long before her little eyes ever see it.  And I put my stamp of approval upon the Bilingual Baby  Spanish video and look forward to purchasing the other titles, including German and Japanese.",998006400,8,688,4.636363636363637
1358789,5,B00004VVPG,Our 20 month old twins adore this video.  They clamor to watch it over and over.  They have definitely learned some Spanish words from watching it.  They also just enjoy seeing the children and animals in the scenes.  The background music is great and makes it bearable for my husband and I to hear it over and over and over. . .,987206400,19,329,4.258064516129032
1358790,5,B00004VVPG,"Trying to find quality CD's & Videos to teach my 2-year-old has been challenging.  I highly recommend this one.  It's very engaging for him and easy to follow.  After only a few sittings, he's actively participating & repeating the spanish.  I'm impressed.",984182400,14,256,5.023809523809524
1358791,5,B00004VVPG,"wonderful case, very suspenseful with twist and turns and the unexpected.  fantastic acting and plot, great casting and passion seen on screen",1382140800,2,142,5.454545454545454
1358792,4,B00004VVPG,"I thought my 2 year old would be interested.  I guess he isn't a baby but still--he loves Baby Einstein videos and this is very similar.  If I sit with him and watch it, he'll stay but otherwise it doesn't really old his attention.  To be fair, the 4 month old I watch seemed to like it (I only let her watch for like 10 minutes though and I'm not really sure how much she's learning;).  My 5 year old also still can watch baby einstein but wouldn't sit through this.
My 2 and 5 year olds love El Perro y El Gato.  The kids don't even realize that they are learning in those videos and they're funny.",1364256000,,600,4.0508474576271185
1358793,4,B00004VVPG,"Spanish Judges has nothing to do with the Hispanic legal system!  Instead it is about the enormous value we put on rare objects and how lack of money is the root of all evil.  A story of deception, double-cross, disloyalty, betrayal and violence.  It is hard to form a firm opinion of the characters as your viewpoint of them changes constantly.  This makes you feel unsettled and unsure and adds to the darkness of the tale.

Considering the amount of dross that appears on our screens these days it is a shame that this film has been so under-rated and over-looked.  It is intelligent, well acted, somewhat disturbing and worth adding to your collection.",1351728000,,656,4.7105263157894735
1358794,5,B00004VVPG,I loved this movie.  It is one of those movies where you get to see the ability of Vincent D'Onofrio's wide range of acting varity.  The story keeps you guessing what is coming next.  It also had a hint of humor.  It certainly kept me interested and guessing how it would turn out.  This is a movie I will watch again and again.,1295568000,3,328,4.142857142857143
1358795,5,B00004VVPG,"Full Moon's SubSpieces is one of the Best Vampire Movies I've ever seen.  Radu makes Dracula look like a Amateur.  In my opinion Radu Vladislas is the most Evil Vampire ever.  The story, costumes and history of Radu as well as the music make for a great movie. the Basis of the movie is  3 girls (2 from America ) who are doing research on the history of Romania and Vampires. They soon find out there may or may  not be more truth to the legends then first meets the eye.

 This move quickly became  number 1 on list of best Vampire movies knocking  The movie Lost Boys down to number two  on my personal list.

Full Moon videos are some of the best films ever. If your looking for something new to watch I highly Recommend the SubSpieces series  which to date has a total of  4 movies and a Spin off of sorts  called Vampire Journals  who's main character has ties to Radu.",1249344000,2,875,4.218181818181818
1358796,5,B00004VVPG,"The vampires are great, especially  Radu. the main villain. Pretty good story, lots of gratuitous nudity and violence, good costumes and makeup, good production values-very entertaining and very superior vampire horror movie.",1210550400,2,225,6.03125
1358797,5,B00004VVPG,"My kids, who are 4 and 2 1/2, love these Bilingual baby videos.  They are always asking me to watch them.  I know that they are learning from them since they use the words daily, especially the colors and numbers.  I definately recommend them.",1153699200,,243,4.4772727272727275
1358798,3,B00004VVPG,"This is an OK video, but not worth all the high marks it has earned. It has one monotone womans voice saying spanish words for actions shown on the screen. There really isn't much action or ""feeling"" in the voice.  Some of the images are confusing  It reminds me of my adult Spanish learning tapes which are very boring. MY 2 year old loves videos but she doesn't seem overly impressed with this one. She does perk up at some of the images (ballons, dog, kittens, exc..) but overall there isn't much to keep her attention.",1136764800,,522,4.427083333333333
1358799,5,B00004VVPG,"My 10-month-old daughter absolutely loves this video and so do I. I bought it for her when she was 8 months and she loves it even more now. She sits there and watches attentively. Funny part is that my daughter goes buserk with excitement during certain phrase or images in the video. When the video is over, she'll make a moaning sound until we re-play it and surprisingly she'll sit through the entire thing.... again!!!! It's very simple for children and it uses images and repetition to re-enforce the words. I am a native speaker and love the fact that the narrator uses a Spanish accent. I've heard and seen samples of other videos and audio and was disappointed to hear an English accent. I think it's important for children to learn to speak Spanish with the correct accent and not sound like someone speaking broken Spanish. Other reviews criticize the quality of the video, but I thought it was pretty good. All and all...buy it; it's worth it.",1103500800,11,954,4.650887573964497
1358800,5,B00004VVPG,"We purchased this video based on other Amazon evaluations.  We are so happy we purchased this video.  We wish it was on DVD, but it's not available that way.  Even still, it's no big deal to fast forward past the very brief intro (no commercials for other videos, YEA).
We got this for my son when he was 8 mo. old (now 18 mo).  He loves Bilingual Baby - Spanish even over the Einstein Videos - of which we have like 10!  He happily watches it without getting distracted.
Additionally, I think this video quickened his learning of the concepts of yes and no.
It's so easy to watch.  My husband and I have learned - especially the pronounciation.  The video focus is on phrazes and words babies and toddlers use most, making it practical too!
As a Mom (and the primary cargiver) I find none of it offencive.  Which is saying a lot for this neurotic Mom!",1085529600,16,852,4.348101265822785
1358801,5,B00004VVPG,"I love this video!!  But more importantly, my daughter loves this video.  She's been watching it since she was 4 months old (she's now 15 months) and it is still her favorite video.  The music is lively and it goes slowly enough and is repetitive enough to really capture a small childs attention.  At 4 months you would think it is too early, but she loved it then and even now, it is one of the only things she will watch.  It probably works well for up to about 3 or 4 yr olds.  Other t.v. is boring and cartoons or animated videos do not capture them like real people and real objects.  Best of all it is TOTAL immersion which is next to impossible to find.  I hope this company makes a part 2 to this video soon!",1080172800,,717,4.107913669064748
1358802,5,B00004VVPG,Great Video but exactly the same as Briany Baby Spanish. Better yet get the Brainy Baby in Spanish and it comes on a DVD with lots of extras.,1050278400,11,141,4.071428571428571
1358803,5,B00004VVPG,"This is a great video. Just when you think they are not learning the second language they surprise you. This video taught him hot to say simple words, phrases, colors. This video offers a little bit of everything. They only speak in Spanish and offer the English version of the word at the bottom of screen. Some folks prefer that they only hear it in Spanish. I prefer saying it in English as well. In our home when I speak to son in Spanish I always repeat in English or vice versa. I think either way works it all a preference as to which route you wish to go. I thought it was a great addition to his Mozart Spanish videos. Hubby and I got a kick hearing him ask for an apple in Spanish. Just when you think your child isn't picking the second language they surprise you or should I say Shock You!!  Son is now 3 and is doing very well with his Spanish. You will not be disappointed. I have since added to his collection and have written a review and his newest Spanish tapes. Hope this review helps if you thinking about introducing a Spanish to your child. You will not be disappointed!!",1046217600,15,1093,4.2548076923076925
1358804,3,B00004VVPG,"Greed and revenge are at the heart of director Oz Scott's, Spanish Judges, an offbeat crime drama.  Jack (Matthew Lillard) is a criminal type, hired by a wealthy collector to steal the ""Spanish Judges"" a valuable antique collector's item.  Things don't go well for Jack, when the ""Judges"" are stolen first by another group of criminals, and he unfairly faces the violent wrath of his employer.
Max (Vincent DiOnofrio) is a small time hustler, with big ideas about his place in the world.  A recent streak of bad luck, is but a temporary setback on his path to becoming a ""successful man"".  A collector of fine antiques, he returns to his apartment, to find that his girlfriend Jamie (Valeria Golino) has home invader Jack, tied to a chair in the middle of his collection.  In a conversation on the roof of the building, Jack claims that he has recovered the mysterious ""Judges"", and plans to exchange them for a million in cash.  In return for watching his back during the swap, Jack promises Max and Jamie, a share of the loot.  Short on cash, and in need of a breakout score, the pair agree to take part in the nebulous scheme.
Piece (Mark Boone Junior), a trigger happy, criminal associate of Max, is also cut into the deal to provide added muscle.  Piece's companion, a strange childlike waif, who believes she is from another planet, and is known only as ""Mars Girl"" (Tamara Mello), completes the rag tag group.  Jack is obviously not telling the whole truth, and actively attempts to influence the dynamics between, Max and Jamie, playing to each of their weaknesses and insecurities.  All is not what it appears, and soon chaos will erupt among the inept band of criminals.
The scheduled exchange takes place, and things take a violent turn.  In the aftermath, things quickly start to unravel, and greed takes over.  The truth about the ""Judges"" is revealed, and the mysterious girl from Mars, shows that she may indeed have some strange powers, as both Max and Jack, loose focus at critical moments.
Spanish Judges is a quirky little tale, that at its finish, seems to answer most of the questions we may have.  The characters are certainly odd, and not particularly likeable, but do strangely come across as believable.  Matthew Lillard gives an interesting performance as a man engaged in constant manipulation.  And Vincent DiOnofrio""s (TV's Law and Order Criminal Intent) performance as the whining, self absorbed Max, has an enjoyable ""theatrical"" quality to it.  If you like crime stories with a twist, you may want to check this out.  Not great by any means, but not a complete waste either.",1038441600,17,2606,4.794183445190156
1358805,5,B00004VVPG,"This is a movie that keeps you guess from the second it comes on until after the movie. Vincent D'Onofrio had an amazing role and he mastered it.  Matthew Lillard was tramendious in here, he was so convincing.  I highly recomend this movie.",1035936000,3,240,4.558139534883721
1358806,4,B00004VVPG,"The Brainy Baby, Spanish, uses the same footage as Bilingual Baby by Small Fry video. Boy, was I disappointed when I ordered both!

1358807,3,B00004VVPG,"I purchased baby bilingual French and Spanish about a month ago. The Baby Bilingual series is a great idea, but don't expect baby to be engrossed in the images on the screen as he or she might be with other baby videos.
The music in the background is nice, classical music. The visual component is nice, as well, and shows real life people and toys. My one year old enjoys watching the videos, but they don't hold her attention as well as other classical music based baby videos have done. I would have liked to see more movement and variety on the screen to hold my babie's attention better.
The videos don't hold my attention too well either, as both the French and Spanish versions are very similiar (actually, almost identical) as they show almost identical visuals and teach baby exactly the same words. Again, more variety would have been nice.",1029196800,13,850,4.635761589403973
1358808,5,B00004VVPG,"My daughter Teresa is 9 months old.  These videos really help in the first stages of language acquisition in a bilingual home.  We thank Small Fry for it, but wish that it was a little more playful, but all in all it is a great tape for spanish speaking infants.  If it was a little bit more mature, I would use it in my pre-k classes, but they would think that its too baby. Using the listmanias offered from other moms, we bought a other videos, too.  We thought that Brainy Baby was too much like an english version of Bilingual Baby, but Teresa likes it too.  Her real favorite right now was the recommended Baby Know-It-All series from one of the Listmanias. They are very simple, but have much more spunk to them.  We have two of their tapes, and Teresa likes them the best, and they are also effective with my pre-k class, especially the 2 year olds.",1012348800,20,857,4.325
