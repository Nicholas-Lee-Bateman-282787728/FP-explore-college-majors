8208919,5,B000TGCRI8,"As a former NBC TV executive, I was there in person for nearly all the taping's of this show (Midnight Special). This is one of the best ""time capsules"" of recorded music history ever! So many of the artists who performed on this show had million selling hits that are still played and remembered today ... problem is, many people today don't know what these groups and singers look like... maybe it's because some only had one or two hits.. or maybe because the artist moved on or changed their career - who knows why some are recognizable and some aren't - but Burt Sugarman has captured these precious moments in time for us to enjoy today and tomorrow!

It's amazing that most of these performances were done ""live""... The groups ""America"" and ""Hall & Oates"" show that they sounded as good on stage as they did on recordings! Olivia Newton-John dancing in her hot pants singing ""Magic"" will captivate you to watch, while Robbie Dupree doesn't look like a singer until the lyrics from from ""Steal Away"" emanate from his throat and you say, ""Oh yeah! I remember that song!!""

With the popularity of Frankie Valli back since the release of the play and movie about his life recently, it's almost strange to see him singing his hit ""Grease"" joined by The Commodores with LIONEL RITCHIE towering over Valli. It's GREAT!

In this world today, I often wish I could turn back the hands of time and go back to those days great at NBC... but now I can!",1424736000,6,1446,4.553846153846154

8208922,4,B000TGCRI8,"It was great to see so many of these acts in their prime!

I used to watch the Midnight Special most of the time but I have admit I didn't see all of them. And since it was so long ago (close to 25 years - my god where does all the time run away to?) I wouldn't remember most of them anyway!

Video was very good and sound was not half bad. If you can pick these up for 10 to $15 and was at least a teenager during the late 70's or early 1980's you will enjoy these. Of course you will probably not like every single act but it will be worth it anyway. Besides, your musical tastes may be at least a little different plus it was fun to see even those who I didn't care for - even if it was to make fun of them!

I've played these, for the most part, outdoors on my 10 foot screen. That way it's more like being there and you can crank the sound a little higher as well.

I would rate this one 8.0 to 8.50 - fun to watch and I enjoyed them a lot. Recommended!",1408838400,2,958,3.7512437810945274
