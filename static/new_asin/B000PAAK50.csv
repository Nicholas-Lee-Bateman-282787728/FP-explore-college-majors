2814638,5,B000PAAK50,"These two movies mark the transition of Mario Lanza from budding opera divo to full blown movie star. His bumpy and ultimately tragic 10 year stint as a Hollywood leading man began with 1949s That Midnight Kiss. The following year MGM released The Toast of New Orleans. Both movies co-starred Kathryn Grayson and a supporting cast of top notch character actors.

 Lets start with That Midnight Kiss and take a peek at this excellently remastered video. The movie opens with stock footage of Philadelphia as it appeared in that era, minus todays skyscrapers yet boasting the looming presence of Abagail Budell (Ethel Barrymore in fine form), who seems willing to spend a fortune to found an opera company rivaling the Metropolitan right in center city Philly, primarily as a venue for her soprano daughter, Prudence, to warble to her hearts content. All she is missing is a tenor, because, really whats a soprano without a tenor? Enter Johnny Donetti, literally, into Prudences living room, where he and his best bud, Keenan Wynn providing comic unrelief, are delivering something or other. Johnny is waylaid at Prudences piano where he decides to sit and sing a Neapolitan song. In walks Prudence, and so it begins.

Casting Lanza as a truck driver probably drove the fictitious story that he was once in fact a truck driver. What he was was a second generation Italian American native of, yes, South Philadelphia, who in late adolescence discovered a phenomenal voice lurking in his larynx and aspired to the opera stage almost at once. When we and Prudence hear that voice, all of us are amazed at its power, youth, warmth, and the masculine charm of its housing, Mario Lanza. He is 28 years old here, hair clipped close, straightened, and bleached a little. His acting assures us he will not be the next Brando, which is fine because Brando was about to be the next Brando, but his singing is simply amazing. He pounds out high notes with glass shattering power in arias like Celeste Aida, and then, astoundingly, he croons more sweetly than the young Sinatra (who himself was already enamored of the Lanza voice) in I Know I Know I Know and They Didnt Believe Me.

While the story was that MGM mogul Louis B. Mayer discovered Lanza a little earlier at a spectacular performance at the Hollywood Bowl, the behind the scenes force was Ida Koverman, Mayers private secretary, who saw in Lanza and Grayson the next generations Eddy and MacDonald. (She had also groomed and promoted Nelson and Jeanette in the 1930s.) The new couple would be an updated version performing not stilted operettas but slick, modern musicals mixing classical and pop genres.

The story for Marios introductory foray into cinema is of a post-WWII vet who has joined with some buddies to form a trucking start-up, with cagey, street smart Mary, also a war vet(!) and much in love with Marios Johnny. They have sensible plans to eventually marry, buy a nice row home near the Italian Market on 9th Street, and have a bunch of kids.

Prudence imprudently upends everything. Johnny, you see, has an amazing voice suited perfectly for opera and his looks and masculine charm make him a perfect partner for aspiring Prudence. Complications ensue. Jose Iturbi, the great pianist playing himself in his final movie, is the only one with the moral authority to confront Prudences formidable Mom and the other parties to sort out the mess created by the Prudence incursion. Johnny (ill-advisedly, in my humble opinion) ends up with Prudence; Mary seems happy sitting in the audience watching them with Keenan Wynn, and, most important, Abagail Budell gets her way.

Incidentally, Jose Iturbi does a rare and marvelous duet with his sister Ampara in the movie. The two performed regularly and were beloved in their time.

The post-war motifs in That Midnight Kiss are interesting, the plot a ball of fluff, and Marios introduction to film was a smash. He sings popular ballads, operatic arias, and even a semi-classical duet, Love Is Music, based on Tchaikovskys Symphony #5. The nation was floored by the voice, and Ida Kovermans plot to reboot the Nelson Eddy-Jeanette MacDonald magic seemed well underway.

Toast of New Orleans, released the following year, finds a somewhat heavier Lanza portraying a bayou fisherman, Pepe Abellard Duvalle, who meets up with visiting soprano Suzette Micheline. Lanzas weight problems became more evident here, and it is said that supporting star David Niven introduced the singer to scotch and abetted a career-long affliction involving booze and a volatile temper.

None of that shows in this, the one movie where Lanza does not portray an Italian singer, although a working class apprentice fisherman from Cajun country is a close enough relative. (Lanza contributed only the soundtrack to The Student Prince, where his character was a Prussian prince.) In his second movie, he is bold, effusive, reckless, and much more comfortable in front of the camera.

The original songs range from endlessly uninspired (Tina Lina) to short and outlandish (Boom Biddy Boom Boom). In the former, Lanza shows his complete lack of dancing ability, sad because his partner is the fresh and gorgeous teenaged Rita Moreno, whom he has a habit of picking up and tossing to his best bud, who, thankfully, is the fine dancer James Mitchell.

J. Carrol Naish portrays Pepes Uncle Nicky in a fine turn and gets the funniest moment in the movie. Pepes powerful voice manages to jangle a large chandelier during a high note, and shortly thereafter Uncle Nicky emits a horrendous growl in an effort to duplicate the feat. Of course, the chandelier remains perfectly still. Naish also played Lanzas restauranteur papa in That Midnight Kiss. He enlivens both movies.

Toast is responsible for Lanzas first million-selling single, Be My Love, which heralded a whole new era in popular male singing. Crooning is replaced by gorgeous, full throated, muscular vocals featuring a sharp, uncomplicated melody line, straightforward, unapologetically sensual lyrics (Be my love, and with your kisses set me burning), and, of course, chandelier rattling high notes the likes of which no one had heard in unaccented English.

Of course, the reason no one had heard it is mainly that no one else could do it. Mario Lanza came, delivered his astounding gift, and left us with no understudy and just a few wannabes. He did make his mark however, in a couple of ways.

He paved the way for males voices of power and unabashed sexuality. Male crooners had been called juveniles, and they sounded like kids with high pitched warbles and girlish undertones. Nelson Eddy, Ida Kovermans template for Lanza, had a strong baritone voice, but it was positioned back in the throat and sounded artificial; when he sang, his pronunciation of English was mannered and, to our ears, comically old fashioned. Lanza sang like we Americans speak. His singing sounds real and relatable even today!

Strong-voiced folks like Tony Bennett , Robert Goulet, and Howard Keel immediately benefited from audience acceptance of Lanzas sexual power (this was the start of the repressed 1950s remember), but the field was limited by the paucity of talent similar to Marios.

If a more raw and manly sexuality was one upshot of the Mario Lanza phenomenon, the second was the stunning and counter-intuitive acceptance of operatic scenes and arias permeating his movies. While radically updating the waning Eddy-MacDonald craze, he brought legitimate grand opera to center stage, and people loved it.

Loved it so much that, soon after Toast of New Orleans, a biopic about Italian tenor Enrico Caruso was rushed into production, and Lanzas finest movie came into being entirely because Lanza came into being.

So, go back to where it all began. Watch the man and listen to the voice that all of America was talking about. Youll see and hear the spectacle that inspired Pavarotti and Domingo to pursue careers in opera. Youll hear the amazing Be My Love, recently recorded by Andrea Bocelli with the original orchestration. Youll understand the meaning of immortal.

At the end, when Johnny shows up on stage instead of Betelli, Prudence still has no way knowing that he will not be marrying Mary and that he hasn't been using her, Prudence, just to get into opera.

2814658,4,B000PAAK50,"Though he lived not quite 39 years, Mario Lanza spent more than half his life as a singer and became one of the best-loved American tenors of the 40s and 50s; many of his recordings are still available on CD.  This two-disc set brings together his first two feature films.  In That Midnight Kiss, set in Philadelphia soon after World War II, he plays Johnny Donetti, an Italian-American veteran of the recent conflict, whose parents run an Italian restaurant.  Johnny himself has been singing since he was a child, and he plays piano too, but when he got out of the Army he decided that music was no way to make a living, got a GI loan, and bought a truck.  When he pauses to play a piano hes just delivered to the home of Mrs. Abigail Trent Budell (Ethel Barrymore), one of the citys Grande Dames and the mainstay of its opera company, hes discovered by the lady herself and her niece Prudence (Kathryn Grayson), who has recently auditioned for troupe director Jos Iturbi (Himself) but finds it difficult to convincingly portray a woman in love with much older, and very overweight, tenor Guido Russino Betelli (Thomas Gomez).  Impressed by Johnnys voice, Mrs. Budell gets him an audition, not aware at first that he and Prudence have experienced an immediate attraction.  (She soon discovers the truth, however, when Johnny appears outside the Budell mansion late one night to serenade the girl.)  Fresh, slangy, fully Americanized, and by no means unambitioushe wants to relieve his mother (Mimi Aguglia) of having to slave over a hot stove all day, and to send his three younger sisters to school to learn the professions they dream ofJohnny turns out to be a hit, although Betellis jealousy remains to be reckoned with.  And, as always, there are romantic complications: Prudence soon gets the mistaken idea that the trucking companys dispatcher, Mary (Marjorie Reynolds), is Johnnys girl, while Johnnys good friend and manager, Artie G. Glenson (Keenan Wynn), is desperately in love with Mary.

The Toast of New Orleans takes the story back some 45 years and introduces Lanza as Cajun shrimper Pepe Abellard Duvalle, who has a powerful natural tenor but no polish at all.  Discovered by New Orleans opera impresario Jacques Ribodeaux (rather improbably played by David Niven) and his star soprano, Suzette Michelline (Grayson again), hes offered a job, but not till his boat is destroyed in a storm does he decide to accept it.  He proves to have natural control, a great work ethic, and a wonderful memoryonce he learns something, even in an unfamiliar language, he never loses it.  But this is 1903, and operatic stars are expected to be ladies and gentlemen, providing an example to lesser folkand Pepe cant lose his common touch.  Meanwhile hes fallen in love with Suzette, who in turn is being quietly pursued by Jacques and thinks Pepe will never be anything but what he is, a backwoods fisherman.  This movie features J. Carrol Naish (who played Lanzas father in Kiss) as Pepes Uncle Nicky, with whom he partners, and a very young Rita Moreno as Tina, the Cajun girl who helps Pepe understand that in his efforts to be what the opera demands, hes losing who he is.  It also features Lanza and Grayson doing a scene from Puccinis Madame Butterfly (Lanza, coinicidentally enough, had sung the role of Pinkerton in the Big Easy two years before).  The movie introduced Be My Love, which became one of Lanzas signature songs and is found on at least two of his currently obtainable CDs.

Lanzas splendid voice is almost a star in itself; even if you don't care for opera, you cant help but be impressed by it.  Its tragic that he died so young, although he might not have continued in Hollywood had he survived; he was planning a return to the stage at the time.",1441411200,3,3771,4.757668711656442

His eyes are so expressive and sexy in this movie also.  Love his voice.  Enjoy any movie he is in.  Toast of New Orleans was a cute movie that showed Mario could act pretty well to be a ""country bumpkin"" and change into a gentleman.

I love these two movies.  The story is simple, it has a happy ending but most of all, it has Mario Lanza.  He was amazing.  These were his first films and they were hits.  I recommend them.  It is impossible not to enjoy this amazing star of yesteryear who is as fresh today as he was over 50 years ago.

Mario Lanza was the most versatile tenor who ever walked on a stage. He could sing opera like the greatest tenors of all time. He was a master at ""crossing over"" from lyric opera to popular singing. As a result, he was a top recording artist and concert performer. After making these two movies, he made the film that made his a legend.  In the ""Great Caruso"" he also showed he could be a global movie sensation. The movie about the amazing Neapolitan tenor actually was about Mario Lanza. It turned the Great Caruso into the Great Lanza. He exhibited all of his splendid qualities.

The movie inspired me to write my recent book about Mario Lanza: ""A Kid from Philadelphia, Mario Lanza, the Voice of the Poets."" It is not a biography. There have been several excellent bios about him. This is a book from a fan. It exhibits his qualities, talents, passion and love for his art. I wanted it to be a ""page turner"" that would be impossible to put down while listening to the magnificent voice of Mario Lanza.

Anyone who loves Lanza the movie star, the tenor, the popular singer and the human being who did so much in such a short time will love these two films.",1381536000,4,1702,4.898954703832753

2814725,3,B000PAAK50,"These two MGM musicals star the singing talents of Mario Lanza and Kathryn Grayson-two of the most famous and best singers in the MGM stable at this time. I consider both to be great singers.  However, the plots of these two movies are very slight.  That reduces the star count on this DVD to 3 to 4 stars.  However, if the viewer would like to skip from musical number to musical number, the star count would go up to 5 stars.  The viewer would then get what amounts to a great musical concert.",1350259200,2,495,4.290322580645161

2814728,5,B000PAAK50,Kathrin Grayson and Mario Lanza. It just doesn't get any better than this. Two of the greatest voices in motion picture (and recording) history.

2814733,5,B000PAAK50,"Toast of New Orleans

I had heard ""Be My Love"" for 20 years before I got the video.  As a pre teen this voice was the most fantastic sound I has ever heard.  It was several years later I got into opera and could appreciate the other things he sang.  Italian songs are pretty melancholy for a kid.

Finally with the advent of video I got to see this delightful movie.  Well supported with Niven, Nash, Rita Moreno and other character actors....and a marvelous dance sequence, the story bounces along enjoyably.  The highlight for me was the Butterfly duet, as Pinkerton was one of only 2 operatic roles he sang, the other being Fenton.

That Midnight Kiss is not quite as well crafted and could use more Lanza singing.

The movie Serenade has some very good opera stagings of arias.",1249171200,13,781,4.521428571428571

2814735,5,B000PAAK50,"Personally, I got the movies for Mario Lanza's voice.  However, I was pleasantly surprised with a few things.
1. The scripts are better than I thought they would be, and the stories are simply delightful.
2. I wasn't much of a fan of Kathryn Grayson, and she isn't necessarily an operatic soprano, but she does some things with her voice that are unbelievable.
However, I must ask Warner Brothers to do the same thing with some later Lanza films: 'The Great Caruso,' 'Serenade,' and 'For the First Time' are some examples.
This is a must-have.",1230508800,5,543,4.71578947368421

2814737,5,B000PAAK50,"When MGM paired its star soprano Kathryn Grayson with newcomer tenor Mario Lanza, the studio got a vocal duo that ignited the screen and made operatic singing so exciting that even people who thought they hated opera rushed to the nearest theater to hear them. In their no-holds-barred solos and duets, Grayson and Lanza provided some of the most spine-tingling musical numbers ever caught on film. Just listen to ""Love Is Music,"" the soaring duet that closes ""That Midnight Kiss,"" or ""Be My Love,"" their first duet in ""Toast of New Orleans."" Grayson sings at the top of her register, and Lanza prodigiously pours forth his magnificent tenor voice. The story lines of the two films are pure fluff, but listening to Grayson and Lanza join vocal forces for ""Libiamo"" from ""La Traviata"" and the Love Duet from ""Madame Butterfly"" is pure joy for anyone who loves great singing.",1221955200,12,873,4.865771812080537

Sure, the story lines in both films may be a little thin, but that's more than made up by the spectacular singing of Mario Lanza.  When you combine him with the beautiful face and voice of Kathryn Grayson, it's over the top.  I would give it 10 stars if I could.",1214611200,2,408,4.1265822784810124
2814741,5,B000PAAK50,"That Midnight Kiss and The Toast of New Orleans take us back to a time in the history of film making that has never been equalled. Everything about these films seems to work. The stars were superb, and the costumes and sets were magnificent. The stories were light and frothy, and there were no real attempts to create ""real"" stories. The audiences happily suspended their disbelief, and were contnent to be carried away by the beauty and purity of the music. Kathryn Grayson and Mario Lanza were magnificent singers and were perhaps at their best in opera and operatic inspired music, a regular feature of films starring these two singers. We may well have been seeing the beginning od ""crossover"" music here. These films represent the best in production values of their day, and were made in 1949 and 1950 when the world was still expressing the joys of the early Post-War period.

This is most evident In ""The Toast of New Orleans. The life force that burned inside him was so powerful that it electrified the entire movie. You can feel the energy radiating from him like a nuclear furnace. In one scene, the shocked expression on Kathryn Graysons face says it all.  Marios expansive and exuberant love of life was too much for any physical body to contain, and sadly, the world lost his earthly presence.
