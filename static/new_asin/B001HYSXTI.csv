3645622,3,B001HYSXTI,"El Diseo del Dvd, los Discos etc estan muy lindos, en cuanto a la Edicion me gusto, pero deja mucho que desear, podria haber sido muchisimo mejor. Esta Pesimamente Editada y Resumida.
Se pierde mucho del comienzo, escenas muy importantes, como cuando Alejandra escucha a Roxana y a Angela hablando en la recamara de Acapulco, cuando Roxana le confiesa a Angela sus secretos y haber matado a la madre de Roberto. Todo lo referente y mas importante del padre de Laura, como el intento de suicidio, se pierde. Faltan escenas de peleas, dialogos importantes.
En cuanto al personaje de Roxana me molesto mucho que saquen tanto de ella y Roberto de la O (Padre e Hijo) al comienzo, tambien que quiten las escenas con Angela, su complice, porque son escenas claves e importantes para la Historia y el desarrollo de la misma.
Faltan todos los Asesinatos de Roxana, sinceramente no entiendo que le pasaba por la cabeza al Editor y al Productor de la Telenovela cuando puso en manos de gente que no sabe editar algo como la gente, o que ni siquiera toma en cuenta la importancia que tienen esas escenas, me parece de mal gusto. Yo entiendo que no puedan dejar todas porque es un resumen, pero hay escenas que no valen la pena, que son de relleno y las que realmente son buenas no las dejan.
La musicalizacion no es la misma que la de la Transmision Televisiva, se escucha una msica arriba de la original, cosa que es un poco molesto aveces porque no se puede entender lo que estan hablando, como ya ha pasado en otras ediciones de Dvds. La musica instrumental de esta Telenovela era hermosa, a mi particularmente me encantaba, pero no esta en el Dvd.
En el Final quitaron la escena en que Roxana va al Hospital e intenta matar nuevamente a Jimena con una tijera, despues de que intento tirarle el acido, pasa directamente a la clinica psiquiatrica en el Dvd.",1303344000,8,1848,4.6030303030303035
3645623,5,B001HYSXTI,"This was one of the first soaps about young people and even when had many of the stereotypical aspects, such as the extreme rich people and the very poor or as they call them in Mexico ""Nacos"" is a very entertaining show, the acting is just great, Adamari Lopez plays a Aids infected ex-party girl, Ludwika Paleta plays the super rich and spoiled who thinks deserves everything in life, she is in reality nothing but a drug addict,..the cast of guys includes Johnny Lozada, former Menudo,.locations in Acapulco are real nice,.I did enjoy it and added it to my collection of Mexican Soaps.",1300752000,,588,4.718446601941747
3645624,5,B001HYSXTI,"I was skeptical of trying but definitely wanted to do it, and loved it.  The package and the DVDs looked new even though they were used.  I truly recommend Amazon.com for any purchase.",1280880000,,184,4.545454545454546
3645625,5,B001HYSXTI,"This was one of my favorite telenovelas when it was on Univision.  Lively and engaging characters, exciting plot, and just a good way to help with your Spanish.  Enjoy!!!",1261612800,3,170,4.827586206896552
3645626,3,B001HYSXTI,"Fue rico volver a ver la novela.

Como se sabe ya stas ediciones vienen super editadas, pero da pesar que eliminen historias que le dan cierta gracia a la novela como la de Moncho en el rol de peluquero o la conversin a ""buena"" de la amiga de Roxana.  Sobretodo si le meten escenas de ""recuerdos"" y adems bien largas o, escenas eternas que no llevan a nada y que sobran porque se vuelven redundantes; podran utilizar ese tiempo para las otras historias.

Sin embargo me divirti volverla a ver, aunque no me dej satisfecho.

De todas las novelas editadas que he visto, la mejor ha sido ""Pasin"".  Ahora empezar a ver ""Heridas de Amor"", vamos a ver que tal sale.",1258243200,,659,4.413223140495868
3645627,2,B001HYSXTI,"I saw the full version and they cut very interesting part as was when Roxana killed her made and how was that Laura's sister came back to life. I am thrilled at all. Poor editing, very poor.",1250035200,4,190,4.162162162162162
3645628,4,B001HYSXTI,"This is one of my favorite TV shows.  It is nice that Amigas y Rivales is finally out on DVDs.  It was fun watching the episodes again.  I was a little disappointed that some of the scenes were deleted.  The disks do show a lot of the important parts of the story.  If you were/are a big fan of this show as well, you will enjoy having this in your DVD collection.",1246233600,,364,4.0
3645629,5,B001HYSXTI,This novelas has always been one of my favorites!!  It was a great novela to watch and it is now great to have it on DVD!!!  Though like all novelas this one is also edited but they do a great job of editing the good parts in to remind you the essence of the story!!  Those that complain of the editing should not get novelas on DVD but since I personally HATE the repetitiveness of some novelas I enjoy them!!!  Buy you will enjoy it!!!  Worth buying if you've seen it and worth buying it if you have never seen it!!!!,1232928000,,519,4.099009900990099
3645630,4,B001HYSXTI,"I have seen this soap when it was first aired. being only 19 at the time it made a huge impact on me since it deals with very real issues like sex, pregnancy, rape, social differences, drugs...I had prayed for years that it would be released on DVD. The DVD is a great asset for someone who has seen the soap fully and just wanted to remember but bare in mind its a very squeezed compilation of the episodes not the full soap. someone who has not seen it might get a bit puzzled since in one scene two characters are mortal rivals and the next best pals! The lenghth of the DVD is 14 hours and the soap was over 200 so you can imagine...I still recomend it though. great soap, good actors, and really realistic juvenile plot.",1230595200,5,725,4.223021582733813
3645631,4,B001HYSXTI,"I am a fan of the telenovela and have been hoping that it would come out on DVD for years.  So I was thrilled to learn that the DVD was being released and bought it immediately and it has just arrived.

I've already watched a few hours of the first disk and have noticed that the DVD is just selected moments of the most important plot points in each episode...  there is enough to get the idea of what is occurring, but they are not the full episodes.  That's disappointing, because most of the hilarious moments were not when the main plot points were moving along but were in the antics of the actors and scenes that were not deemed important enough to be on the DVD.  My wish is that they will eventually come out with a DVD that features the full-length episodes, but until then this is still entertaining and makes me remember why I loved the show in the first place.",1229904000,5,873,4.298780487804878

8310157,2,B001HYSXTI,"I was very disappointed because so much was removed from the original telenovela. It's basically a summed up version that highlights the most important scenes. I just wished that was clearly outlined when I made the purchase. I still would've purchased it, but at least I would've been mentally prepared. Most of the reviews provide this warning, but it should be provided by the supplier.",1470528000,2,389,5.0
