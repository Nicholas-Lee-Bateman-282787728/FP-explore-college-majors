3909926,5,B002D83PYA,"This was a gift for an 80 yr old neighbor who recently lost her husband and her best friend.  She always loved Bela Lugosi and thought she'd never see the original movies he made.  When she opened this, she was so happy.  She watches these over and over.  A neighbor told me that she's been perky after not doing well.  I've seen these movies and enjoyed them.  Worth every penny in so many ways.",1386115200,5,396,4.283783783783784
3909927,4,B002D83PYA,"I enjoy these movies, all only a little longer than an hour, so I could watch two at one sitting. The Brooklyn Gorilla movie is more a comedy than horror, and I don't care too much for the Eastside Kids movie either. I like Bela Lugosi and these movies showcase his talent for being spooky.",1380931200,,290,4.290909090909091

3909929,3,B002D83PYA,Well the quality wasn't great and the audio was pretty good but it's completely worth the price! The way it was shipped in like a vacumm bag was no protection at all! One of the disc's was loose so it had scratches,1350000000,15,214,4.119047619047619
3909930,5,B002D83PYA,"I'm so sick of people picking on some of his movies.
This guy was one of the best actor of his generation.
He did not get the opportunities he should have. He
could play anything. I agree some of these movies are
B grade but he had no choice but he always gave great
performances and some of these are his best. Most actors
would've phoned it in he didn't! I love old black and
white mystery horror that actually have a story not
like the crap made today. I watch these over and over.
If people weren't glued to phones and brain dead maybe
they would see how great these movies were. Lugosi like
Karloff made great and bad pictures but they loved their
craft no matter how bad material was. True Professionals.",1301443200,51,710,4.3059701492537314
3909931,1,B002D83PYA,"I have all these Bela Lugosi movies on other collections. (They do keep cropping up.) I read the description only because I was intrigued by the inclusion of Groucho Marx as one of the actors...in fact, the only actor mentioned aside from Lugosi himself. I'm something of an authority on Bela Lugosi, having been watching his movies since the late 50s when I was in high school. Nowhere, in any of his movies, to my knowledge, does Groucho Marx appear. If someone can explain this to my satisfaction, I will be more than happy to buy that person a glass of wine...or blood?",1281744000,10,573,4.572815533980583

These eight movies from the 1930s and 1940s are Budget pictures in monochrome. They represent the kind of entertainment now found on television in color. It aint Shakespeare. The essence of these movies is a threat that comes upon the people. But by informed action the people together are able to overcome and destroy these monsters. The book Hollywood Horror by Mark A. Vieira is a complement to these mid-budget movies. Curt Siodmak was the talented scriptwriter who created many of the facts associated with these monsters (garlic, silver bullets, etc.). For more details read the individual reviews.

1. White Zombie
A wealthy plantation owner strikes a bargain with a voodoo master to create a zombie bride. Zombies get the lowest wages and won't join a union.

2. Bowery At Midnight
A criminology professor leads a gang of thieves by night. Anyone who gets in his way ends up buried in his cellar  until a mad doctor reanimates the corpses!

3. Invisible Ghost
A doctor unwittingly commits murders while hypnotized by his wife's ghost. After an innocent man is executed, his twin and the doc's daughter uncover the true killer!

4. Spooks Run Wild
A goofy gang spends the night at a creepy mansion and encounters its owner  who remarkably resembles Count Dracula!

5. The Corpse Vanishes
A doctor keeps his wife young with the glandular fluids of virgins! Will a reporter be the next victim?

6. The Devil Bat
A chemist changes a bat into a monstrosity trained to kill. An ace reporter soon becomes the next target!

7. The Ape Man
After making himself an ape man during a horrific lab experiment, a mad doctor hunts for the cure  human spinal fluid!

8. Bela Lugosi Meets A Brooklyn Gorilla
A scientist on a remote island finds the perfect lab rats when two jokers parachute into his lair!",1443657600,3,1828,4.805111821086262

3909934,4,B002D83PYA,"The BELA LUGOSI HORROR COLLECTION is a decent, 8-movie compilation of scratchy, public domain films. WHITE ZOMBIE has Bela as the eeevil Murder Legendre, lording it over his crew of zombie slaves. Arguably Lugosi's finest, creepiest role! BOWERY AT MIDNIGHT has Bela playing another wicked role as a crime-boss, killing off the unwary for fun and profit. INVISIBLE GHOST- A man (Lugosi) is haunted by the image of his dead wife. Is he insane, or is something else going on? SPOOKS RUN WILD is one of the two films that Bela made w/ the East Side Kids (the other one, GHOSTS ON THE LOOSE, is not in this collection). Basically, the Kids run around in a big old house w/ Lugosi. Suitably absurd. THE CORPSE VANISHES- A mad scientist (Bela) murders young brides, absconds w/ their bodies, and uses their fluids to keep his wife alive! Every bit as awesome as it sounds! In THE DEVIL BAT, Bela plays another mad scientist. This time, he's developed a gigantic, mutant bat that he uses to exact vengeance on those who've wronged him. Pure, cheeezy delight! THE APE MAN finds Lugosi in an Amish-like beard, sleeping in a cage w/ his go-rilla friend, and killing more people for their bodily fluids! Brilliant hyper-schlock! BELA LUGOSI MEETS A BROOKLYN GORILLA is a horrid ""comedy"", utterly bereft of any true mirth. It contains a cantankerous Lugosi, the title go-rilla, and a pair of criminally non-humorous ""comedians"", pretending to be Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis! Oh my! Anyway, if you don't already own these movies on one of the zillion other collections they're included on, then this isn't a bad way to spend some sleepless nights...",1439769600,4,1636,4.825622775800712
