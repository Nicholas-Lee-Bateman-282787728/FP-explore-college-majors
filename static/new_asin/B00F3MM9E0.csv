8612028,3,B00F3MM9E0,Not all that hard core but it is good to watch from time to time..  I gave it 3 stars,1359504000,,85,3.25
8612029,5,B00F3MM9E0,"What more can I say that hasn't been said by the other reviewers. But as a fan of Lauren Hays, this one rocks! Decent enough along the plot lines. But most importantly, for a fan of softcore entertainment, fully naked Lauren Hays. A must have for any softcore collector!",1234396800,5,270,4.530612244897959
8612030,3,B00F3MM9E0,"i liked the movie because lauren hays is in it. that the reason why i bought it. however you are better off just renting it if you can or borrowing it from a friend. i like the fact that it was basically an all girl adventure.(that's just me.) and inspite of the fact that it's soft porn i apprieciate the fact the makers of the film tried to make it look like a bigger picture than it actually was, they had good imagination. they worked very hard on it - i could tell. and even though it is not a really good movie i think they did a really good effort. i'll say this about it. it was trying to be a takeoff of the tomb raider flicks, and at that i think they were much more better than the real thing, at least they tried to tell a story.  so i guess i recommend it. but i got it because of lauren hays and i could really give a rats ass about the rest. i leave it up to the personal taste of others to decide.",1141689600,13,913,3.8823529411764706
8612031,1,B00F3MM9E0,"About two or three times a year I host an event I call ""Cheesy Movie Night"", wherein a half-dozen people get invited to taste carefully selected cheeses, followed by an evening of one or two odd or ""so-bad-they're-good"" movies from my collection.

I bought Womb Raider to add to that collection, mostly on the strength of the soundtrack and a couple of reviews.

Big mistake.

I wasn't expecting much, of course, but what I got was so bad I wouldn't show it to my friends for risk of them avoiding my next party.  It tries for silly, sexy and exotic, but instead hits stupid, skilless and painfully boring.  It sports a ""shot on video"" look as flat as a daytime soap opera, some of the simplest edits are obviously (and frequently) out of sequence, and it even makes the laughable mistake of cutting to exactly the same shot, something I haven't seen since ""Manos, Hands of Fate""!

The female lead is obviously trying to do decent work, but she's the only one.  No one else is competent, cool or remotely sexy.  It's like an on-location XXX film without the dubious benefit of the hardcore sex.  I don't mind goofy, silly or unintentionally hilarious, but simply put Womb Raider is plain stupid.

Halfway decent soundtrack, however...",1138406400,5,1234,4.6976744186046515
8612032,4,B00F3MM9E0,Lots of fun. Girls are sexy. If you like Seduction Cinema stuff this is even better -- better looking and better shot. Not bad for a T&A. My only knock -- the bad guys are too hokey!!,1128384000,9,183,3.972972972972973
