2716543,5,B000LXGV54,"I don't own a motorcycle, but I love the Talimena Drive. I've been to the Rocky Mountains, Big Sur, Kauai, etc., and still think this drive between Oklahoma and Arkansas is thrilling, even in a car, even on a virtual motorcycle. You can't really appreciate the drop-offs, but that's probably just as well.

This was a great way for me to enjoy the drive while on my exercise equipment. I'll admit we were going faster than I was peddling, but I got a great workout! Lots of twists, turns, and rolling hills.

The introduction was even enjoyable and was short enough not to be annoying.  I appreciated the way he gave us important information the way your friend would. He was very likable and made me want more of these videos from other rides.

In his brief introduction he reminded us of the deer and the fact they wouldn't get out of our way even if they saw us. I liked the way he phrased it, making it our responsibility to watch out for the deer.

He also very wisely recommended that we find something to do in town when fog is on the mountain. He mentioned that there will be cars driving it, even when the fog is so thick that the car drivers can't see their hood ornaments. That has happened to me. It wasn't foggy when we started the Talimena Drive, but soon we couldn't see past the hood of the car. It was terrifying because we had been there enough to know that it's scary enough when you can SEE where you are going. We couldn't pull off though because we didn't know if we were next to a drop-off. We couldn't slow down because we didn't know if there were cars behind us. We would never do that again and I'm so glad that the narrator gave that advice. Find something to do in town until the fog clears.

Then there's the music.  <grin>  I actually enjoyed the music even though the same refrain kept going over and over. I found it invigorating or maybe I was trying to go faster to outrun it. About the time I thought I was going to go insane if I heard it one more time, we started down the mountain with different music--completely different style. If the music gets to be too much for you, it's always possible to bring your own and turn down the sound. It wasn't really a problem for me and it did make me work out harder than I normally do on my indoor bicycle, treadmill, and elliptical machine.

There were points in the video where we are riding along looking back at the scenery. Because the scenery is important to me, that didn't offend me at all. I only wish it were possible to show what's a few feet OFF that road, as you hang close to the curves. {shiver} It was a fun adventure.

All-in-all, I enjoyed this video so much that I've ordered others of different areas.

This video did what I needed it to do. It motivated me and entertained me while I worked out. Well done!",1268179200,,2806,4.295454545454546

8164964,1,B000LXGV54,I only watched 5 minutes. The ride looks great but charging for someone's  GoPro helmet footage on roadways with not even a map in-lay much less intelligent narration is not really an adventure.,1433894400,,194,4.878787878787879

8164966,1,B000LXGV54,"This COULD have been much better.  The photography is fine.  But I grew up in Mena and traveled the Talimena highway very often during my life (including long before it was improved and named Talimena), and instead of showing the views from a few of the scenic overlooks, and riding right through Wilhelmina State Park without so much as a mention or a scan through, we listen to music.  We stopped watching a third of the way through.",1425081600,,435,4.551282051282051

8164969,1,B000LXGV54,"An avid rider, I watch em all.  This one never shows the bike or offers any usable knowledge.  It's just a really bad version of low definition (not even GoPro) video view from the bike.  Sad, really, really sad.  The blogger needs to watch his competition...........  Please refund my $1.99",1399939200,,291,4.74
