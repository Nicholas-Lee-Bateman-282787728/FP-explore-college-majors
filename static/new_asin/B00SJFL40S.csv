6990613,4,B00SJFL40S,"What's not to love about a classic.  Sure the special effects are dated, but this is my childhood!
Original is 5 stars.
Not expecting much made it fun to watch.  Can say the kids liked it more than original:(
Remake is 3
 It comes with the set, so I watched it.  I honestly cant' remember the plot though.
Wrath is 2.

Each movie comes on it's own blu ray disc (not 3 movies crammed on one)",1429142400,2,390,4.078947368421052
6990614,3,B00SJFL40S,The only problem I have with both of the triple features is the blu Ray holder itself. Both cases don't have the proper cases to hold three blu rays. Instead two discs are piled on top of one another.,1428019200,5,200,4.153846153846154
6990615,5,B00SJFL40S,All the clash of the titans movies in one set?! Can't beat it and the only one of the clash sets to purchase in my opinion. Great deal!,1427068800,,135,3.857142857142857
6990646,4,B00SJFL40S,"Clash of the Titans: Nice effects but somehow lacking in heart, Sam Worthington's Perseus sallies forth to gain Medusa's head to defeat the Kraken and save Argos.  Lots of amusing Easter eggs, like Bubo from the first Clash of the Titans and Polly Walker from ROME as the vain queen of Argos.  Mads Mikkelsen works surprisingly well as the grizzled Greek soldier with his facial structure.  Picture quality very good for the BD.

Wrath of the Titans: A step up from the prior movie in terms of emotional range for Sam Worthington who now has a son and overall plot.  He's dragged back into the fray when Hades and Ares decide it would be nice to loose Kronos from Tartarus.  Kronos' presentation is quite impressive as he leaves the volcano and strides the earth again.  Again very good to great picture quality on the BD.",1522368000,,822,4.627586206896551
6990647,5,B00SJFL40S,Nothing beats the original but with this edition you get that and the reboot and its sequel! Definitely worth getting!,1522022400,,118,4.95

6990654,4,B00SJFL40S,Great set of movies!  Being old I like the original movie the best but that's just personal preference.  I had to knock a star off as the packaging has all three discs on just two holders so I'm worried that one of the movies will get scratched due to being stored on top of each other.  That's a design flaw.,1502496000,2,309,4.116666666666666

6990671,5,B00SJFL40S,"Grew up loving the Harry Hamlin version of Clash of the Titans. Been craving it and know I will again so figured easiest to just buy this and have it as often as I like. The remake and Wrath of the Titans aren't horrible. Fun CG flicks if you're a fan of Greek mythology movies.
Really though. The original Clash is where it's at. Wish I still had the action figures.",1482710400,,367,4.183098591549296

6990707,4,B00SJFL40S,"After the success of George Lucas' Star Wars in 1977, the entire fantasy and science fiction genre was reinvigorated in Hollywood.  Science fiction saw the television series Battlestar Galactica bow in 1978, followed by the first Star Trek movie released in 1979.  The fantasy genre had two movies bow in 1981, Dragonslayer and Clash of the Titans.  Both have become cult classics that spawned their own sub-genres.  Clash of the Titans would be remade in 2010, with a sequel coming soon after in 2012.  All three movies of this franchise are packaged neatly together in this 3-disc combo.  The three movies are the same as the theatrical version, with some deleted scenes present on the discs for the two new movies.  Seeing all three together, it is interesting to note that the 1981 version is actually the more risqu film, with several scenes of full or partial nudity whereas everyone in the two newer films are fully clothed.  As to the acting, I prefer the old Clash of the Titans, as it seemed more natural and less forced, and the dialogue flows better.  The old Clash of the Titans film has its visual and audio effects cleaned up and enhanced on the Blu-Ray, making it of the same quality as the newer films, without taking away from the creative powers of Ray Harryhausen, this being his last film.  Overall, this package is a great deal, especially since it is cheaper than the two-disc version containing only the two newer films.",1460332800,3,1444,4.74

6990714,3,B00SJFL40S,"Just wondering on these combo packs and specifically this one in general. Is there any remastering done on either of these movies or are they simply combo-packed and marketed? My specific reasoning is that the classic ""Clash of the Titans"" from '81 in its original BD release looks 20 times worse than a VCR tape, more fog and clouds than San Francisco.",1439942400,2,353,4.709677419354839
6990715,4,B00SJFL40S,Brought this for the value.  Not a fan of the modern remakes but for the price you can't beat all three movies in one package.  Great image quality and surprising amount of extras.  If you're only a fan of one of these movies it is still worth it to have all three for this price.,1437264000,6,280,4.054545454545455

8698638,4,B00SJFL40S,"These films are fun to watch. They are filled with action, ancient Greek myths, magic, superstition, misbehaving gods, impossible acts and impossible animals, and more. The 1981 Clash of the Titans is a good example of the three films on this disc. With an open mind and a desire to watch adventure, viewers will find it delightful. The basis for the film is the belief that the gods are fallible and do quite a number of things that are improper and immoral. It is also based on the idea that the Titans controlled everything before the gods took over control and imprisoned the Titans. Zeus, the head of the gods, travels around and seduces or rapes young girls. Many of the girls give birth to children who are half gods. Perseus, the protagonist in this film, is the offspring of such a union. Zeus wants to protect him and orders the gods to give him magical items to protect him, such as a helmet that makes him invisible, a sword that can cut into marble, a super strong shield, and an owl that can lead him to where he wants to go. Later, Perseus is also able to tame Pegasus, the winged horse which can fly him to where he wants to go.
Zeus' wife Hera also has a son, Calibos, and is mad at Zeus for failing to give him gifts. In fact, Zeus turns him into an ugly creature. Before the turning, he was very handsome and the most-beautiful virgin Andromeda was willing to marry him. But no longer. Now, Perseus wants to marry her, and she wants to marry Perseus. Calibos decides to do all he can to stop the nuptials. Among other acts, he captures Pegasus. He gets help from his mom and other gods. They arrange it so that in 30 days Andromeda must be given to a Titan as a virgin. Perseus sets out on several adventures to stop the gift, including finding three witches, finding a being that if you look at her you are turned to stone, visiting the land of the dead, and more.",1525824000,,1884,4.339943342776204
