8611903,4,B00F3F6SNK,"Great content for Blue Belts or above.  It would have had 5 stars but there is a ""review"" section immediately after the move.  Sometimes it is helpful but usually it's just the members of the school, where the seminar/DVD was filmed, totally destroying the technique, thereby making it confusing (so skip the review section of DVD).  At some points even the black belts were raping some of the simplest moves.  An incompetent blue belt knows that a palm up/palm up choke is done with second hand going under, not the reverse (just one example, there are many more).
That being said, you WILL pick up loads of information if you have a solid year under your belt (no pun intended).  Babu appears to be a very likeable, charismatic and knowledgeable man who enjoys teaching his chosen art.",1461888000,,787,4.7153284671532845
