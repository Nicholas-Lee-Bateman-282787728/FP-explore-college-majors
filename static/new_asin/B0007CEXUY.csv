2208371,4,B0007CEXUY,"This collection is a great deal for the price. I loved reading Ray Bradbury when I was a kid. When the series first aired in the 80s I didn't get to see most of it so when i saw this great deal at Amazon i couldn't resist it. Generally, I'm more of an outer space adventure fan, but I still enjoy the strange tales of mystery and occult fantasy that these kind of series specialize in. Bradbury does a good job including a few speculative sci-fi tales within it all, but his obvious passion goes with the simple timeless mysteries of the contemporary present tense.

There's only one problem I have with these Dvds and it's nothing big. I simply wish the menus had included the ""Play All"" option, because I love to just put these things on while I'm working with my computer all day and just let them play without having to keep making selections every 30 minutes. Sci-fi marathons help keep my mind off the noisey neighbors while I'm busy working or browsing the internet. I suppose the ""Play All"" option wasn't included due to the high volume the Dvds devote to the actual series itself, which would also explain the simplicity of the menu. No problem there, since the series is the thing. Great deal, I love it!",1193443200,3,1214,4.468468468468468
2208372,4,B0007CEXUY,"The first half dozen episodes of THE RAY BRADBURY THEATER were made in Canada for the HBO network. After that, the program moved to USA (another cable outfit) for an additional four seasons. Most impressive are the number of actors who participated in this sci fi/fantasy series, from the most famous (Shatner, Goldblum, O'Toole and Nielson) to stars of yesteryear (Linden, Stapleton, Pollard and Culp).

Scripts were reworked by the author himself, chosen from his archive of over 400 short stories. Twenty years earlier, Bradbury had written for ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, so he was already familiar with the challenges of the half-hour format. All 65 episodes of THE RAY BRADBURY THEATER are here for your discovery or re-enjoyment. They just don't make 'em like this anymore!

2208373,1,B0007CEXUY,"Why spend 32.00 on a DVD that you can get for 12.99 just a click away.  And why give this a positive review and that a negitory!  Are you the same people that said Buying Star Trek for 150+ was a bit frivolous? Nerdy sci-fly channel child prodigy,hippie-crits!",1158883200,9,260,4.395833333333333
2208374,5,B0007CEXUY,"I have always liked Ray Bradbury's mind.  As a kid I read his stories in comic books and as a teen I read nearly all of his books.  When the Ray Bradbury Theater was on the USA Channel in the 1990's I tried to never miss it.  I don't understand why, but I guess I was one of the few people on the planet who had no difficulty in setting my VCR to record whatever I wanted to watch if I wasn't home to watch it.  As a result I just happen to have a few miscellaneous episodes of the Ray Bradbury Theater around that I recorded fifteen years ago.  The visual quality of the video tapes were nearly as good as the actual broadcasts.  I was excited to learn that the entire run of 65 episodes of the Ray Bradbury Theater were released on DVD last year but after reading some of the disparaging revues railing its inferior quality, I refrained from buying it.  Recently I bought a used copy on Amazon and I have been kicking myself ever since because the quality is better than my video tapes and I have been really loving watching the many episodes I have never seen.  True they do not look as pretty as transfers of high-budget Hollywood fare of today but the originals were never filmed on 35mm and will always look like a TV show.  If you like Ray Bradbury or if you enjoyed the show, you'll be glad you bought this set.",1138492800,188,1319,4.181818181818182
2208375,4,B0007CEXUY,"Finally, The Ray Bradbury Theater is back on DVD!!!  This forgotten classic is a must for all anthology lovers (Twilight Zone, Night Gallery, Amazing Stories).

The Show began on HBO and showcased some high profile names from the 1980s.  It was moved to the USA Network and apparently thrived enough to have been on until the early 1990s.  Personally, I think the show would have been better off if it would have stayed on HBO because the early episodes are a few minutes longer and being on a paid movie channel they attracted bigger names.  Plus, the original opening to the show with Ray walking around his office was a lot more atmospheric and creepy than the later episodes on the USA Network.

Like all anthology shows there are some bad episodes.  However, what I like about this show is that ALL of the 65 episodes were written by one of the greatest American writers of the 20th Century!  True there are some sleepers and stinkers in the bunch, but in general this is a very entertaining show.  Even the episodes that do fail, I think suffer more from ineffective special effects and/or lackluster acting and dialogue than from Mr. Bradbury's actual ""ideas.""

This box set is very affordable.  Unfortunately, the re-mastering is mediocre in picture and sound quality and because there are like 13 episodes per disc, the episodes look pixilated during fast motion scenes which can be annoying!  To top things off, the episodes aren't even in the order of which they aired and there is even misspelling of a title on the DVD menu!  However, I'm just happy to have this show on DVD.  I got it for a great price and provided like a month full of cheap entertainment.  For my 2 cents worth, I would say ""The Playground,"" ""The Murderer,"" and ""Tomorrow's Child"" are the high-water mark episodes of this show.  Down below I rate each episode.

My rating system goes like this:

Excellent ... is a classic episode

Acceptable ... is an enjoyable, but perhaps slightly flawed episode

Poor ... is a boring and/or weak episode

""Marionettes Inc."" Acceptable

""The Playground"" Excellent (The ONE everyone remembers!!!)

""The Crowd"" Excellent

""The Town were No One Got Off"" Excellent

""The Screaming woman"" Excellent

""Banshee"" Excellent

""The Fruit at the Bottom of the Bowl"" Excellent

""Skelton"" Poor

""The Emissary"" Acceptable ( It bugs me they have a girl playing a boy character!)

""Gotcha!"" Excellent (Starts off slow, but then becomes intensely scary!)

""The Man Upstairs"" Acceptable

""Small Assassin"" Poor

""Punishment without Crime"" Excellent

""On the Orient, North"" Poor (Zzzzzzz...)

""The Coffin"" Acceptable

""Tyrannosaurus Rex"" Poor

""There was an Old Woman"" Acceptable

""And so Died Riabouchinska"" Acceptable

""The Dwarf"" Acceptable

""A Miracle of Rare Devices"" Poor

""The Lake"" Excellent

""The Wind"" Acceptable

""The Pedestrian"" Poor

""A Sound of Thunder"" Excellent

""The Wonderful Death of Dudley Stone"" Excellent

""The Haunting of the New"" Poor

""To the Chicago Abyss"" Poor

""Hail and Farewell"" Excellent

""The Veldt"" Poor

""Boys! Raise Giant Mushrooms in Your Cellar!"" Poor

""Mars is Heaven"" Excellent

""The Murderer"" Excellent (Both hilarious and thought provoking, my favorite episode)

""Touched with Fire"" Acceptable

""The Black Ferris"" Excellent (It's like a mini movie)

""Usher II"" Acceptable

""Touch of Petulance"" Acceptable

""And the Moon be still as Bright"" Acceptable

""The Toynbee Convector"" Excellent

""Exorcism"" Poor  (Seems like a pilot for a bad TV show)

""The Day it Rained Forever"" Poor

""The Long Years"" Acceptable

""Here there be Tygers"" Acceptable

""The Earthmen"" Poor

""Zero Hour"" Excellent

""Colonel Stonesteel and the ""Desperate Empties"" Poor

""The Concrete Mixer"" Acceptable

""The Utterly Perfect Murder"" Acceptable

""Let's Play Poison"" Poor

""The Martian"" Poor

""The Lonely One"" Excellent

""The Happiness Machine"" Acceptable

""Tomorrow's Child"" Excellent (A bizarre episode, Rod Serling would have been proud!)

""The Handler"" Acceptable

""Great Wide World Over There"" Acceptable

""Fee Fie Foe Fum"" Poor

""The Anthem Sprinters"" Poor

""By the Numbers"" Acceptable (A surprise ending, indeed)

""The Long Rain"" Excellent

""The Dead Man"" Excellent

""Sun and Shadow"" Acceptable

""Silent Towns"" Excellent (Very Funny)

""Downwind from Gettysburg"" Excellent

""Some live like Lazarus"" Acceptable

""The Tombstone"" Poor",1138147200,590,4344,5.24633431085044
2208376,1,B0007CEXUY,"Huge ripoff, very shoddy image quality. I felt so burned. Video quality genuinely worse than a used eight-hour slow-speed EP VHS tape. The fault is NOT the source material. I have old VHS SP recordings of Bradbury Theatre off cable, and in direct comparison they're far better than the DVD, which tells you just how bad this whole set is.

A DVD normally carries 2 hours of material at decent video quality. Platinum Entertainment, however, chose extremely high video compression and crammed 13 half-hour episodes per disc, providing 6 hours at absolutely terrible video quality. When a  vendor crams things on disc like this, they are choosing to be cutrate, saving them cost of extra discs and of course make a higher profit at the expense of your visual enjoyment. The rotten video here does not appear accidental but a deliberate quality choice. Shame on these people for taking advantage of Ray's name to sell garbage.

Just a few of many examples: In 'The Pedestrian' and many other episodes, many shots pixellate (break up into jagged blocks) into unwatchable versions. Lousy video in dark night-time scenes in 'Banshee', again bad video compression. In 'A Sound of Thunder', the spinning timesphere completely breaks up into huge blocky video chunks due to incompetent video processing. This did not have to happen. Professional video encoding DOES allow vendors to choose temporary better compression in scenes with fast moving objects for far better video quality, but Platinum did not. The discs look a lot like an amateur effort using consumer video encoding software instead of professional tools. Every video in the set is brutally flawed enough to make you cringe.

In retrospect, I should have gotten a clue from the package statement of ""over 28 hours"" on 5 discs to mean the material would look awful. I hope that someday Bradbury/Atlantis pulls the rights and someone else issues a better version. Until then, avoid this set and Platinum. I am pretty sure you will be sorry otherwise.",1135382400,185,2003,5.006006006006006
2208377,5,B0007CEXUY,"If you don't know Ray Bradbury & haven't read his stories, then you may have missed something elemental and exciting all these years.  Ray Bradbury is the Godfather of Sci-Fi.  The Martian Chronicles, The Illustrated Man, Something Wicked This Way Comes, Farenheit 451, the list goes ever onward...

I have been waiting for some time out of mind for this collection to come out on DVD.  I used to watch the show whenever I could on USA and when I saw it here on Amazon, I had to have it.  I have ready nearly everything Bradbury has written, so each episode of RBT brings back a short story or a piece of novel that he has done.  Great stuff...

The bad part of the show is that some of the production values were pretty low.  The phazing picture from video to digital transfer is evident as well, but I can live with those things.  We see a slew of great actors and guest stars in these episodes.  We see the great Bradbury stories like The Veldt, Usher II, A Sound Of Thunder and so many more brought to life.  I would love to see what could be done today with Bradbury's body of work in the hands of some visionary like Peter Jacson or Spielberg.  At least we have this to view.  Packaging is great.  Price is not too steep.  Worth the buy and worth the Bradbury!",1127779200,7,1266,4.282700421940929
2208378,5,B0007CEXUY,"If you are reading this you probably already know of the Ray Bradbury Theater show itself, what I'm going to talk about is the actual quality of the product.  I hadn't seen much info on this set online and what I had seen were mixed reviews, from my point of view I'm extremely pleased with the set.  The packaging is great, and comparable to other box sets like the Chappelle show with the foldout case inside of a slip case, which is surprising considering it is manufactured by Platinum disc corp.  Whom from my experience only releases bland generic titles to sale at various dollar stores.  It also has full color and attractive photos on the inside and out showing scenes from the show, the discs themselves are one sided and contain about 12 episodes per dvd.  They play just fine on my cheap Apex dvd player audio and video are in sync and everything is broadcast quality, with some artifacts here and there but it looks like what I remember from the Sci-fi reruns of the show so I'm happy as could be with this purchase.  Great show by the way and 65 episodes are great.",1124064000,18,1079,4.451776649746193
2208379,4,B0007CEXUY,"I gave this program 4 stars because it's one of the most enjoyable, suspenseful, strong plot series I have ever seen. I like it even better than Twilight Zone. The reason it lost a point is because of the poor video quality. It is grainy, it shakes and locks up briefly sometimes and simply does not do justice to the creative and exciting story telling. I recommend this set anyway. Look past the poor video quality and enjoy it. If you like the Outer Limits, Twilight Zone, and Hitchcock, you are sure to love this!",1118016000,8,517,4.4526315789473685
2208380,5,B0007CEXUY,"I've been waiting for a long time to see this series come to DVD. I remember watching it when I was a teen and loving it. Now, almost 20 years later, the show lives again on DVD! Some of Bradbury's best short stories are shown here, including ""The Wind"", ""The Veldt"", ""The Town Where No One Ever Got Off"", and ""A Sound of Thunder"" (being made into a feature film for this Summer). There are over 65 episodes here, which gives you an idea of the hits and misses you'll find. Not every episode is a gem (what series could ever say that anyway?), but most are great. Guest stars galore like Jeff Goldblum, Drew Barrymore, Peter O'Toole, William Shatner (in a REALLY creepy story called ""The Playground""), and lots of others (remember, this was the 80's, and those were big names then). The special effects aren't necessarily anything to brag about, but the stories can keep you on the edge of your chair.

Unfortunately, the image transfer is horrible at times. The images blur when the camera moves, or pixellate at odd times. Some of the images look washed out. But keep in mind that this was probably made off of older masters, so you can't expect perfection. I'm just glad to see it finally made it to DVD so we can see it again in its entirety!. The shows range anywhere from 22 to 30 minutes.

If you're a fan of the Twilight Zone (of which Ray wrote a couple of episodes), then this is another great series to add to the collection (and at a good price for all the episodes). There are no extras at all in here, but I can live with that. Thanks for bringing it back for us!",1112054400,159,1577,4.342372881355932

I'm not sure why they seemed so frightening then; I was brought up watching the Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, and shows like that - these seemed, somehow, more real then...

Now I watch them and have a bit of nostalgia, but they're not what I remember.

They are all great short stories, though.  Some much better than others, but great.

They crammed as many stories on each DVD as they could, so the low bit rate made the video was blocky at times. No extras on the DVD or inserts with disc info.  I had it on while I was working on other stuff, so I mostly just listened and glanced at the screen from time to time. So it was fairly enjoyable.

Right now, the Amazon new price is just under $8, and I'd say that's not a terrible price, but I think $5 is about what it's worth. There's several videos on youtube, maybe all of them, so I'd recommend watching them there.",1418601600,4,643,4.128

The last thing Ray Bradbury's great stories should be is pedestrian, but that's what we get to often in this collection.

However, at this price and at this time this is as good as we're going to get.  So I'm not regretful that I purchased this DVD set at all.

Many of these stories have a beautiful and often unsettling creepiness to them that I have not seen anywhere else.  (I am especially thinking of the story 'The Playground', which featured William Shatner in what might have been his most un-Kirk-like role ever.)  Unlike other reviewers, I found the video quality more than acceptable.  Maybe it's because the video quality is actually better than many say it is, or maybe it is because I grew up with televisions that only had rabbit-ear antennas; I am not sure exactly which.  In any event, I would rather watch one of these stories on a standard-definition tube-television than one of those incredibly stupid big-screen-high-frame-rate-3D super-hero movies that seem to be all the rage these days.",1391558400,,905,5.040268456375839

2208496,4,B0007CEXUY,"Echo Bridge (previously Platinum) are a budget-line releasing company who specialize in no-frills, dirt-cheap releases... and that's pretty much what you get. No subtitles or captioning, no additional languages, no chapter stops, not even a simple insert that lists the titles of each episode. The overly-compressed video (they squeezed about 5 and half hours onto each disc) is about on par with a bootleg release. If they had gone for a 10-disc set, I'd say that these episodes would have looked a LOT better, but as this is all that's available currently, I don't think it's a waste of what little bit of money this set cost for over 26 hours of entertainment.

The series itself was one I only saw sparingly back in its syndicated run. Since I'm a sucker for shows such as The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, Night Gallery, Tales from the Darkside/Crypt and so on, I figured it was worth dropping a ten-spot on this release. I knew full well what to expect as far as the mastering quality. With 65 episodes, there's a lot of fun to be had if you can pretend you've gone back to the 80s and are watching it on the TV technology of that era. Until someone gives this a more loving treatment, I'd say that the average watcher can enjoy it for what it is - dirt-cheap entertainment.",1385424000,5,1283,4.578260869565217

Several years ago I met Ray Bradbury and his friend Ray Harryhausen while they were at a SciFi Fantasy convention in Collinsville, IL.  Meeting them and getting their autographs was one of the highlights of my life.  I happen to be a fan of Ray Bradbury's writting, but the DVDs come in a decent case and are good quality. I would have preferred they weren't stacked on each other, but for this price I can't really complain. I recommend you snatch this up before they go OOP.

I will not go into the review of each episode because everyones opinion is different, but I will say the last two discs just plain sucked. I don't know if these correspond to the 4th and 5th seasons, but they just got plain sloppy - the fiming was amateurish with very low quality acting, and the set was a cheap something from the 50's. The episodes progressively became worse and worse until they were worse than b-rated shows. I can see why the series was cancelled after the 5th (?) season.

2208536,5,B0007CEXUY,"For Ray Bradbury fans this is a most excellent buy!  Most of the stories come from ""The October Country"",""The Martian Chronicles"" and ""The Golden Apples of the Sun.""  However, they are not in the order they appear in the books and it is difficult to swop back and forth between discs if you want to watch them that way.  One of the major obstacles to that is the fact that when you leave a track it jumps back to the first menu.  With each of the five discs having 13 tracks and three menus you might as well just sit back and enjoy (and remember where you left off.)

Each show is 27 minutes long with no commercial breaks.  I do not know who set the order in which they appear on the discs because it does not follow the production order or the broadcast order for HBO or USA Network but the seasons are kept pretty much intact.  The production quality is good with much of it filmed outside the United States.  With stars like William Shatner, Michael Ironsides, Peter O'Toole, Jeff Goldblum and Drew Barrymore (in a tale with a real twist) even those who are not keen on Bradbury will find something they like.

It's not just Sci-Fi.  Bradbury wrote tales of romance, human interest and mystery as well as cautionary tales and parables about the human condition.

Buy this and it won't just set on the shelf like the rest of your collections. Something or someone will make you think about an episode and you'll think, ""I want to see that again.""

But note this: Google ""Ray Bradbury Theatre"" and make a copy of the episodes lists. Then write down the disc number and order of each show as you watch them because you will be going back for more.",1354752000,,1649,4.3881578947368425

I was very excited to add this to my DVD library and am looking forward to reacquainting myself with the series.

2208540,3,B0007CEXUY,"This DVD is the most lousy DVD package ever. THey put all 5 discs on a single spindle inside the case. THey didn't even put numbers on the Discs! They could have at least done that.

As for the show itself, it's pretty good thus far-as of this writing, I have four more episodes left on the first disc. THe DVD transfer is good-if not great. The Audio is better in some than others. There's a total of 65 episodes-averaging 13 per disc. Here's the problem: To put that many episodes on one disc(Which total 5 hours per disc)you have to use more compression-the more compression, the less quality there is. That is why on a show like this, there should be no more than 8 episodes per disc. If there were 9 eps on one disc, that would make 8 discs.

I think my rating is very generous-I guess I love this show. If there are future releases planned of this show(I doubt it)please improve the packaging and use more discs.",1344902400,6,918,4.3313953488372094

The episodes are quite good and include actors like Peter O'Toole, William Shatner, Drew Barrymore, Jeff Goldblum, Eugene Levy, David Carradine, Shelley Duvall,and Partick Macnee.

If there is a downside to this set it is that the quality is low, but not the worst I have seen. The black levels are not very deep and so there is not the range of contrast one would expect from a dvd. The fuzzy image quality is closer to a well played VHS tape, though I didn't really find that this detracted from the stories.

The show itself follows in the tradition of The Twilight Zone, Tales Of The Unexpected etc and while not every episode is great most are of a high standard. Also, one of the great pleasures is seeing all the guest stars.
I have to say that the greatest thrill for me though was watching an episode and suddenly realising that it was filmed a quarter of a mile from my house! (the episode was 'There was an old woman')

Still have not watched every episode, but have really enjoyed the ones that I have watched!  Had seen a few of the original episodes when they aired in 1992-93.  But, I had forgotten about this series until it was suggested on The Twilight Zone page.

Really great deal!  Have enjoyed seeing actors from 20 years ago like Leslie Nielsen, William Shatner, Drew Barrymore, Robert Vaughn,  Sally Kellerman, & Elliott Gould.

Went to innermind.com & printed out the episode guide.  Each video in the series only lists two of major actors in each episode at the beginning.  I hate when I recognize an actor but cannot remember the name.  So that episode guide really helps!

2208548,4,B0007CEXUY,"I saw many contradictory reviews, so I wanted to add my observations about this collection.

First, I received no index or table of contents to identify which story was on which DVD, and the DVDs themselves don't have a ""Disk Number"" printed anywhere on them. So I thank the people in the reviews who have taken the time to catalog the stories on the 5 DVDs.  I printed out the list from the review to put into the box, and marked each DVD with the appropriate disk number. (The disk number is identified at the DVD menu.)

The quality of the actual video has been heavily criticized by some, and while it is highly compressed, my opinion is that this is a very good overall quality of video. While there is some pixellation in some scenes, it's not frequent nor overly distracting. Since I saw some stories from the series on broadcast television the first time, this collection provides a better viewing experience than I had in those olden days. (My viewing equipment does upconversion and pretty good filtering, so your mileage may vary. Also, my expectations may be lower than some people's...  This met my expectations for a 1985 to 1990 video source.)

Some of the stories are wonderful, and some aren't so wonderful...  Again, my expectations of 1985 to 1990 television production values color my opinion in this area too, so the periodic bad acting and cheezy special effects are somewhat forgivable. I'm surprised how many of these stories I remember seeing, but didn't remember that they were part of the Ray Bradbury Theatre.

Overall, this is an excellent collection of wonderfully imaginative Bradbury stories at an absolute bargain-basement price, and the memories alone were worth the cost for me.",1326153600,2,1713,4.845890410958904
2208549,2,B0007CEXUY,"Packaging for this product is problematic and the production value of the discs is ridiculously low. Considering how cheap the set was, there isn't a LOT to complain about.

I watched the first two shows and watched it for audio and visual quality so I could do an honest review.  This is a great set with great audio and a clear picture.  It is worth more than the $10 they sell it for.  If you like the Twilight Zone, you will love the Ray Bradbury show (Who by the way, wrote an episode of the twilight zone).  This series is comparable to the Twilight Zone but alot cheaper!!!
Buy This set!  Very cheap entertainment",1324425600,3,756,4.151724137931034

I have to admit I am an avid Bradbury fan. So on finding this on Amazon.com I quickly filled out a order. Shipping was fast. It actually arrived a couple of days before it was supposed to. Package arrived in great condition. All DVD'S played excellent. I am very pleased to be adding this set to my collection and will be shopping a lot more in the future at Amazon.com",1320624000,,515,4.16

2208553,5,B0007CEXUY,"The first half dozen episodes of THE RAY BRADBURY THEATER were made in Canada for the HBO network. After that, the program moved to USA (another cable outfit) for an additional four seasons. Most impressive are the number of actors who participated in this sci fi/fantasy series, from the most famous (Shatner, Goldblum, O'Toole and Nielson) to stars of yesteryear (Linden, Stapleton, Pollard and Culp).

Scripts were reworked by the author himself, chosen from his archive of over 400 short stories. Twenty years earlier, Bradbury had written for ALFRED HITCHCOCK PRESENTS, so he was already familiar with the challenges of the half-hour format. All 65 episodes of THE RAY BRADBURY THEATER are here for your discovery or re-enjoyment. They just don't make 'em like this anymore!

2208554,5,B0007CEXUY,"I was a bit surprised to see the *I watched 2 episodes and never watched anymore!* type reviews of this collection. I know there are many episodes that cover things I'm not so interested in (anything with Mars in the title) but those episodes always have at least one redeeming quality, a star I haven't seen in awhile, or some aspect of the story that is highly creative. For every episode that doesn't just knock it out of the park there is an episode that everyone needs to watch, such as Usher II, about the outlawing of imagination, or The Black Ferris, which is the story Something Wicked This Way Comes is based upon. Yes, there are probably episodes that cover something you aren't interested in, but that is because the scope of Bradbury's writing is HUGE.

I can be a real literary snob but Ray Bradbury may actually be my favorite writer. His writing and the episodes of this show have captured lost eras and imagined new ones while representing them in a way with a lovely and intense kind of wonderment that is Bradbury's hallmark. This is 26 hours of 30 minute (well, 23-25 minute) episodes of the writing of one of America's greatest writers and I am glad to own it.

Btw, the collection is pretty bare-bones, there isn't even separate envelopes for the dvds and no extra features, other than some story/inspirations that Bradbury filmed at the beginnings of the episodes of the original show. But so what, that would be an extra-feature, if they hadn't already filmed it.

I appreciate that this collection exists and I watch episodes whenever I have a free moment.",1315526400,2,1581,4.659498207885305
2208555,2,B0007CEXUY,"I watched the Ray Bradbury Theater growing up and really wanted a hard copy of the series. I was very excited to find it on Amazon, but once it arrived, I was highly disappointed. The way the series is set up, from the packaging, to the menus on the individual discs, to the crummy appearance and lack of remastering makes the whole thing look like a crummy bootleg. I actually looked the series set up online to make sure it was licensed set and not just that someone burned the episodes from their VHS to a dvd. But unfortunately, that is the quality you get to look forward to with this set. The audio on the playback is sometimes low with a hum in the background and there is no option of closed captioning or subtitles. The picture, while cleaned up a bit, still looks grainy. And mind you, all of this is from a CRT. I couldn't imagine trying to watch this particular dvd series on a 1080p or even 720p.",1315440000,4,909,4.290697674418604
2208556,4,B0007CEXUY,"I don't need to say much about the show, with all the episodes written by Bradbury himself, the show is great. Before I bought the DVDs I had already read a number of reviews saying how terrible and unwatchable these DVDs were. Having watched a number of episodes from all of the five discs, I can say that it is true that there is some pixelation, but if the company had simply shelled out some more money and put these on 10 discs instead of 5 I think this wouldn't be a problem. But they are by no means unwatchable and a number of episodes don't have these problems. Overall for the $11 I spent on this, I am really happy. Perhaps in the future they will rerelease them and fix some of these issues.",1310947200,3,703,4.214814814814815

2208558,2,B0007CEXUY,"I bought this series expecting something like Amazing Stories or Twilight Zone, but RBT is way below.

Most of the stories were insipid, kinda low budget and lack the interest we are used to with AS or TZ.

I stopped watching it halfway on the third DVD...

I rated 2 stars because it is worth mentionning that this series featured some great actors, but beside that, don't waste your money on this set",1305331200,3,402,4.47945205479452
2208559,1,B0007CEXUY,Of the five discs only one of them would play on my dvd and the picture quality of that one was poor at best. For the price I didn't expect a lot but I got even less than expected.,1304035200,16,180,3.641025641025641
2208560,5,B0007CEXUY,"All I have to say about this DVD set is WOW. I completely enjoyed every single episode, and many of them brought back sweet memories of innocence in the 80's as a youngster.  Mr. Bradbury truly outdoes himself in this TV show, I absolutely recommend this set.  From the original Twilight Zone series to this Theater set, his stories have only gotten better polished over time. Triple A Plus.",1303862400,,391,4.6521739130434785
2208561,1,B0007CEXUY,"This series deserves a re-released, the video quality is horrible and the case design layout is unacceptable, there is 5 discs and rather than having a spot inside the case for each disc, there is a big rod in the middle of the case, like a little spindle, and naturally when i recieved it in the mail all 5 discs had fallen off and were LOOSE inside the case. To make it worse, the case is made out of the lousiest plastic i have ever felt in my life. It reminds me of the plastic they used to put in the middle of a pizza to keep the box from smashing it. Ive seen better case designs on factory safety videos.

Extremely Dis-Satisfied.",1301616000,15,638,4.186991869918699
2208562,4,B0007CEXUY,"Although I never watched this series when it was on originally(I never even heard of it until I came across the first season at a drugstore) I bought the first season and loved it so I purchased the complete series and although the quality isn't the same as The Twilight Zone or Tales From the Darkside, I do love the stories and for 10 bucks for five disks I wasn't expecting the sharpest best dvds to ever be released but I am happily surprised with this set, it is very enjoyable to watch and I haven't noticed any fuzziness to the picture quality at all, it looks like any other old show I would watch on tv and I love that it brings me back to eightys tv again.  This is a great collectors set for anyone that loved the spooky old classics from years gone by, very pleased with my purchase and the great price!",1300320000,7,815,4.2243589743589745
2208563,5,B0007CEXUY,"The series, to me, began with a bang, then tended to become less intense but more imaginative and creative as it progressed season by season. The themes circulated around common ideas, which isn't a bad idea, but tended to reflect more often than not the current political, cultural, state of affairs with unusual psychological/dramatic twists. I suppose this is to be expected: we live out of a cultural remix that is reflective of many interpersonal, political, psychological perspectives. Bradbury, as always, shines as a fiction writer regardless of the dramatic interpretation of his literary genius. The color is georgeous for its time; the sound is clear and crisp; the smoothness of movement from one scene to another is without fault.",1298246400,2,743,5.2
2208564,4,B0007CEXUY,I really enjoyed this DVD set. Most of the stories were really good and interesting. There were a few that were not so great. But all in all Bradbury shows us he has an amazing imagination and with a cast of great actors that imagination comes to life in this series.,1297987200,3,267,4.254901960784314
2208565,2,B0007CEXUY,"I love Ray Bradbury. 'What a treat', I thought, 'to have a TV show collecting so many of his short stories.'

Alas, this is not the standard it deserves to be. And Bradbury's work, sometimes, is so perfect on the page, but not quite so perfect on the screen. (At least not in the way it has been done here.)

I've seen about ten or so episodes, but when I got to the episode 'The screaming woman' it took me about fifteen minutes to realise that it was one of my favourite of his short stories (Which I'd already read, and imagined as a short film) and when I realised what a botchery they'd made of it, well, I just couldn't bring myself to sit through anymore.

I don't mind cheap TV, but Bradbury is one of, if not the best, short story writers ever, and when a short story takes about 10 minutes to read, whilst an epsiode takes double that to watch, why watch third rate TV, when you can read first rate writing in half the time?

One day, I imagine, somebody will remake this show. There are so many hundreds of great stories to choose from. And if you haven't read his work, do yourself a favour. Read the books instead.",1297036800,5,1127,4.227906976744186
2208566,5,B0007CEXUY,"Ray has an amazing body of work and being able to see some of the lesser known short stories as well as the famous ones on video is fantastic.
Highly highly recommended!",1294963200,4,169,4.3125
2208567,4,B0007CEXUY,"It's great getting 65 episodes for such a low price.  Also, I agree with some of the other reviews that some episodes are better than others.

I started out watching disc 5 (volume 5) because it was on top.  However, most of the weakest episodes, imo, are on volumes 4 & 5.

Regardless, there were episodes that I have remembered fondly for many years, that have held up well.

Specifically:

""A Sound of Thunder""
""Hail and Farewell""
""The Veldt""
""Mars is Heaven""
""The Black Ferris""
""The Long Years""
""The Playground""
""The Screaming Woman""
""The Lake""",1293840000,3,548,4.71578947368421

Sure, the image quality leaves a little something to be desired, but on my 52"" Samsung LCD it is definately acceptable...Sound is below average...

You then click on it and the quality looked like someone ran a video tape through a tape-to-DVD converter that they bought from a local discount store. Grainy, pixilated, and when viewed on a PC, it appears that it was not meant to be viewed in full-screen mode at all.

The colors are muted. There are no extra features (one of the reason that people buy DVD's). This is produced by some cheap company that didn't understand quality.

If you are looking for a ""bargain"", go with the version without the ""collectable tin""(unless you're just into collecting them!):  the 5 DVDs already come in a hard-case flip file, smaller than the box, so ultimately the box is unnecessary - especially because THERE IS NO LISTING OF THE EPISODES ANYWHERE ON THIS PRODUCT, other than when you actually view the DVD, of course!

Dark disturbing stories are made emotionally distressing for the viewer through dramatic camera angles, superb lighting, and top quality acting.  Bradbury Theater is not Twilight Zone, not Hitchcock, and not Outer Limits, but just as these shows have their unique and characteristic signatures, so does Bradbury Theater.  Where Twilight Zone is clever, Hitchcock unexpected and Outer Limits strange, Bradbury is twisted with a hint of the demonic.

2208606,4,B0007CEXUY,"I missed Ray Bradbury theater when it was originally broadcast, so I jumped at the chance to purchase this collection. I have not been disappointed! The only reason I give it 4 stars, not 5, is the video quality itself, which is rather poor (but certainly watchable), I assume due to very high compression used to get so many episodes on each dvd. Balancing that is the very low price, so overall it is a wash.

If you are a Bradbury fan you will be familiar with many of his famous short stories filmed here. I have noticed some, mostly minor, changes from the original stories, but nothing that wrecks them. And I must assume that the series was filmed in Canada or possibly even Europe, based on the accents of many of the supporting actors, and the locations, many of which do not look particularly American -- certainly not Bradbury's ""middle America."" But that doesn't really hurt the shows, either, in my opinion.

What you are getting with this set are plenty of well-filmed, fairly faithful adaptations of stories by a great sf/fantasy author, and this sort of thing is just about impossible to find any more. It's several notches above your standard tv sf/fantasy pap. Get this collection and I think you will be pleased.",1236211200,5,1231,4.668202764976958

2208610,3,B0007CEXUY,"Having remembered this series from the 80's & seeing the episodes again,I remembered how poignant & creative Ray Bradbury was. His sense of nature,
locales,imagery & most of all his childlike views of  both this world
& otherworldly possibilities were on display on many of the episodes in
this series & otherworks he did. The mini series ""The Martian Chronicles"" starring Rock Hudson back in the 1970's was truly a great piece of work
from Mr. Bradbury. When I think back to other true geniuses in television
such as Rod Serling & Alfred Hitchcock,I would put Ray Bradbury's name in
that select list.
  In my grading evaluation of the episodes in this series, some were outstanding,some ok & some very poor which is why I graded out this series 3 out of 5 stars.
  Some of my favorite episodes from this series were Silent Towns,The Town where no one got off,The Playground,The Concrete mixer,Marionettes,Gotcha,Here there be Tygers,The Lonely One & The Toynbee Convector.
  I do recommend this series to any fans of Ray Bradbury as a tribute to a man who can truly be said when it came to imagination,his was limitless.",1225584000,6,1121,4.807291666666667
2208611,5,B0007CEXUY,"If the creative mind is a mystery to you...this is a MUST!  Especially if you're entertaining ""writing"" Sci Fi...you need this.  In this series you'll find stories that later developed into portions of Bradbury's other works like The Martian Chronicles and Something Wicked This Way Comes.  It was a tickle to see the ""first drafts"" (as it were) of these thoughts, and then realize how he altered them for the larger presentations.  Needless to say, there is a ""star studded"" cast.

This is Bradbury...he's something you put in your collection if, for no other reason than he is one of the major Science Fiction masters. No Science Fiction collection is complete without his contributions.  But, then, there's also the fun of watching the creative mind at work?  I'd recommend this collection of stories.  There's something for everyone inside!  I do have one reservation: Because a number of the episodes end with a negative or frightening conclusion, I would not recommend this for children of an impressionable age.

For the real SciFi buffs, here's a amusing item.  In this collection is a story called The Jar.  Now, anyone familiar with Rod Serling knows what that story is about.  It's the same theme...two authors deal with it to the same conclusion.  You decide who did the better job or writing!",1225497600,6,1305,4.926605504587156

I guess his stories or some of the acting and era these shows were filmed in aren't going to be to everyone's liking or suit their tastes but something about them for me goes along with Ray Bradbury's taste and style. Each episode starts with him walking into his ""junkroom"" of ideas where he keeps all these little odds and ends. All these objects inspire him and each one becomes a story in and of itself so that gives you an idea of this man's capacity to imagine and dream up things. The performances in my opinion, compliment the stories. Some of the ideas come from his real life experiences and he sets up some episodes by telling you this story and then showing you how it inspired him. So you really get to see the act of writing or how his brain works which I think is pretty cool. It doesn't always make sense and so that's another realistic and mystical factor of his work. I think it's worth it if you're interested. Just buy it already!!! ;)",1207267200,7,1110,4.29047619047619
2208616,3,B0007CEXUY,"This is a nice collection of the Ray Bradbury series that was on cable TV some years back.  I had missed most of them, so it is nice to get them all in one package.  However, the video transfer to DVD is about the worst I've ever seen.  The box says ""digitally mastered"", but since DVDs are digital, EVERY DVD is mastered digitally!  It looks as though they used old VHS tapes as the masters, then digitized them at very low bit rates. Lost of pixelation, especially in motion scenes.  In addition, there was obviously no attempt at color control during the mastering process, as things can range from oversaturated to washed out from one scene to the next.  I guess this is to be expected when they put 28 hours on 5 discs (5.6 hours per disc), when a movie is usually around 2 hours per disc.

That being said, it is nice to have all of these stories that haven't been done elsewhere.  A couple (The Long Rain, and The Veldt) were both previously done by different actors/directors in the movie "" The Illustrated Man"".  As with any series, some episodes are better than others, but they give you a great insight into the creativity of Ray Bradbury.

So, I'd give 5 stars for content, and 1 star for quality, averaging to 2.5.  I'd buy it again, but be prepared for the poor transfer.",1203724800,26,1285,4.4025423728813555
2208617,5,B0007CEXUY,We watched the first disk as a loaner in an RV park and decided we had to have the entire series. The ending on many of the episodes are left somewhat to your imagination. We truely enjoy them.,1203033600,2,193,4.105263157894737
2208618,3,B0007CEXUY,"I'm only giving this series 3 stars because the intro theme to the episodes on the first disc is great (they changed it a little on the second); otherwise, I would give it only 2 stars. I particularly like the section of the theme where Ray Bradbury enters his trinket-filled room and declares it the source of his inspiration. Bradbury's stories seem to be either hits or misses. Most of them to me unfortunately, are the latter. I liked, ""The Coffin"" (lots of British wit), ""The Town Where No One Got Off"" (picks up nicely toward the end) and ""Gotcha!"" (genuinely scary at the end). The rest - at least up until half of even the next disc - were just boring. I haven't decided when I'm going to finish watching them all but given my experience so far, I'm not in a rush (which is why I might as well write this review now).

The series apparently ran around 1985 and is every bit as dated as you would expect (perhaps more). The main problem I see with it is that most of the stories start off too slowly and some are also difficult to follow. The endings are often not worth the wait. You could say they are anticlimactic. I would guess the budget for each episode was tight even though there are notable stars that make appearances in some of them. Nothing on the level of Tales from The Crypt, though. That series was far more entertaining and had more star cameos. The DVD set itself is quite nice and colourful. It would be the perfect gift for a diehard fan of the show but probably a dreadful one for anyone new to the series, like me.",1200182400,7,1544,4.324137931034483

Most important NO CAPTIONS INCLUDED or CC. It is a DVD for crying out loud not VHS, this brought the review rating down significantly. The quality of the visuals is poor, VHS quality at best.

Some of them are even heartfelt and tender and have nothing to do with sci-fi or horror. I only saw a few episodes in the 80s so this is not nostalgia talking, though I have to say older TV programs and movies are much better than the stuff made today and this series is testimony to that. And I do like the 80s and the 80s elements in this show; the synthesizer music, 80s actors, hairstyles, etc. This is a show for people who do not suffer from short attention spans and not for people who just like CGI action movies. Slow buildups, character driven stories  and clever endings in this show.

8046784,4,B0007CEXUY,"When the Ray Bradbury Theater was running on TV in the late 80's and early 90s it was pretty innovative. They did a lot with limited budgets and the anthology format. Some signs of a lowish budget are apparent if you look for it. William Shatner and Peter O'Toole are among the best known actors and there are lots of others of the time in one story or another.

The big attraction was Ray Bradbury who had already created some of the best science fiction.writing of the day including Fahrenheit 451 and the short story collection of ""I Sing The Body Electric"". He was riding high as a leading author and figure in science fiction. Unfortunately I don't think his series is quite up to the level of his writing..

For younger folks who were very young or not even born when the series aired it may seem too dated. Having seen this as a younger adult this is apparent but doesn't bother me much. I have enjoyed watching the series on DVD, but have not be drawn to binge watch like some other older series I've also bought.

If you remember the series fondly or are a science fiction enthusiast this is likely a good purchase. I'm glad I got it 5+ years ago and continue to watch some of the episodes from time to time. All considered I think this set is a good 4 stars. It just doesn't hold up to the passage of time quite as well as some other series.",1504137600,,1351,4.290196078431372
