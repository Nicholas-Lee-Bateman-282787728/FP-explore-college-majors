4332661,5,B004DL0R5U,I've seen probably more fly fishing how-to videos than the average angler over the past 20 years.  This is superbly produced with stunning visuals that will make you want to be a better caster.  The video presentation while awesome is accompanied by cogent audio instruction that is spot on for the video presentation.  I find this instruction to be valuable for not only a novice caster but both the intermediate and experts as well.  I don't think I've ever seen casting instruction that can apply equally to all levels of fisherman.  I tried out some of the roll casting tips this weekend and was very happy with the difference it made for me.  I do hope Carl and his team produce more stuff this is truly top-rate and well worth your time and $$.,1313971200,4,750,4.559701492537314
4332662,5,B004DL0R5U,"I have been flyfishing for about 3 years. I understand the basics of flyfishing. Carls DVD has been a real value to me. He starts by  explaining multipal types of casts, then deminstrates the cast, Then uses visual aids to show the action you preform for more clairity. I have not seen a DVD on flyfishing with this type of detail. I have tried some of them and they work. It also has improved my present casting by showing me the little mistakes that I have been making. I would recemend this to anybody beginner and experienced.",1312329600,2,530,4.463917525773196
4332663,4,B004DL0R5U,"well produced, well thought out how to information.  practical information you can use to resolve challenges on the stream & river.",1305849600,2,131,5.238095238095238
4332664,5,B004DL0R5U,"The title says it all. If you want to catch more fish on rivers this DVD will be a great help. I have bought casting DVDs by Fernandez, Roberts, Kreiger and Gammel and watched my friend's Kreh. Yes they are all good and if you want to learn to cast both in the salt and in freshwater you will learn a lot from them. But this DVD is different. It teaches you how to catch fish by the use of specific casts and as an expert fisher Mc Neil has a fine command of which ones are important in achieving this end. He is also a superb presenter as he neither burdens you with too much or too little information. Besides all this, the DVD is beautifully filmed with slow-mo and normal speed shots which make it easy for the viewer to see how the casts are made. I am certain that when I master all that is presented here I will catch more fish and I'm confident you will too. I thoroughly recommend this to anyone wanting to take their casting and fish catching to the next level.

4332665,5,B004DL0R5U,"This is an extraordinarily clear, detailed explanation of several useful slack-line casts. If you're looking for beginner casts, this probably won't help you much, but if you're tackling more challenging rivers and want to improve your presentation, this DVD is the ticket. Great visuals, and his use of high-visibility line and slow-motion video is outstanding. One of the best fly-fishing videos I've watched.",1376524800,,411,5.5396825396825395

4332668,5,B004DL0R5U,Extremely well produced! Best DVD on the art of Fly Casting yet. Covered areas nowhere else. Highly recommended. Well worth the money,1373760000,,133,5.090909090909091
4332669,5,B004DL0R5U,"If it comes to video instructions in fly-fishing, this video by Carl McNeil is by far the best I have ever seen. It has a remarkable analysis and method and explains in gin-clear structures what the essential are to be regarded in order to cast the fly successfully. Not enough the visualization is simply breathtaking. The times of blurred fly-fishing-videos where the viewer has to assume the lure are past. This crystal-clear shoots show you every detail of movement and result in high-resolution and slow-motion. By watching this video over and over again combined with the dry practice having Carls pictures and instructions in mind you will get very much closer to good casting results. Obviously this means more catched (and hopefully released) fish and fun at the water.

Therefore best added-value to this video and the provision of a Dr. h.c. in Flyfishing for this game-changing master-piece!

Thanks a lot to you and your team Carl!",1363478400,,944,5.006369426751593
4332670,4,B004DL0R5U,"Video is good, instruction is good.  I was hoping for some more detail on a few casts but overall it is good.  Good examples of casts on the water which is nice to see in a video.",1349049600,,179,3.810810810810811
4332671,5,B004DL0R5U,"Great camera work, beautiful scenery, clear and concise instructions. Just a fantastic DVD all-together. I'm happy I purchased this now, at the very beginning of my fly fishing adventure, as opposed to trying to figure it (the casts) out by myself for the next decade. Thanks so much!",1345593600,,284,4.9375

8425547,5,B004DL0R5U,"Cleared up some long existing problems in a few minutes.  Has given me an inventory of casts beyond my Overhead and Roll Cast, but more importantly has given me a grasp of the physics which allows me to understand what is causing a problem.  I especially love the slow-mo diagrams of line movement.  Has cured me of ever thinking 11 o'clock - 2 o'clock, and started me thinking about the cast I need right now.  I very much love my much improved Roll Cast with Reach Mend.",1443225600,,472,4.390804597701149

8425549,5,B004DL0R5U,I love this DVD. Highly recommended for improving your casting in general as well as for river-specific situations. Great quality cinematography and well thought-out lessons.,1398729600,,174,6.0
8425550,4,B004DL0R5U,"This dvd does a nice job of covering the mechanics of casting. I particularly like the high visibility fly line and leader. The presentation style is also relaxed and no-nonsense. There are also many other YouTube videos providing tips and I expect by absorbing all of this information my casting technique will improve in the coming year. But the title raised the hope that I'd get a bit more information on when to use the casts, i.e. how to read the water and which cast was appropriate for which situation. That's the only reason I dialed back a star.",1381881600,,555,4.616161616161616

8425553,5,B004DL0R5U,"Exceptional quality and techniques.  It is time I upgrade from the stabby, punchy, belligerent casts that I have adopted from a lifetime of self taught techniques.",1379462400,,163,5.269230769230769
