2353142,4,B000A2XC5S,"There are good and bad to this video.  I don't like the part where you have to have a partner holding equipment because I don't have the equipment and I'm not going to buy it just for this video.  But, overall, it's not too bad.  I rotate this in on occasion with my Jillian Michael's DVD's to break up the monotony, but it's not one of my favorites.",1240617600,,350,4.117647058823529
2353143,5,B000A2XC5S,"I enjoyed this workout very much. The queueing is right on, the energy is high, and I love the mix of cardio, drills, and sculpting. Janis does a really nice job demoing, mixing it up, and keeping it fun.",1235088000,,204,4.256410256410256
2353144,5,B000A2XC5S,"I bought this because I love kickboxing. It's more challenging than most of the other videos I have, and I haven't done it often, but am building up to it. I had a lot of fun when I did it, but couldn't finish it - so it's great to have on hand for advanced-level cardio.",1232150400,,271,3.9454545454545453
2353145,5,B000A2XC5S,I would definetly recommend this exercise video. I had alot of fun with it and it did seem to help with learning some kickboxing moves.,1230681600,,135,4.44
2353146,3,B000A2XC5S,"I have been working out with Tae Bo and the gym for years.  I have been looking for an alternative to the original Tae Bo advanced and have yet to find one that combines the full body workout and intesity that it provides.  After reading the reviews here, I thought that I found it; but sadly I would say that it falls short on working abs and legs.  Plus, the added weight on the hands are not good for your joints.  This is more beginner then intermidiate or advanced and while her technique is good, it is not that challenging.",1211241600,,530,4.27
2353147,5,B000A2XC5S,"I just got this workout.  It was fun and challenging.  You pretty much work all parts of the body as you do pushups, squats, lunges, various punches, various kicks (including the hook kick), lots of core work as most of the moves incorporated the core the entire time, partner drills (there are two members of the group who do all the moves without a partner so you get twice the workout doing it solo). The instructor cued the moves very well. If you don't feel this workout, then you need to put more energy into it.  If you like to kickbox, this one is worth it!",1209772800,,565,4.311320754716981

After ""Quickfix"", this one will challenge you a bit.  But after doing ""Hardcore"", ""Strike Zone"" will feel like a day at the park.  ""Stirke Zone"" is still a good workout for days when you are feeling tired and not up to the faster pace and more complicated combinations that Gomez offers in ""Hardcore"".

All in all, ""Stirke Zone"" is a good addition to your kickboxing- aerobic library.  The group who works- out with Janis on the video is lively and the music is upbeat.

I would not recommend this DVD if you've never done kickboxing- aerobics before.  Unlike ""Quickfix"", Janis doesn't slow down to teach you how to punch and kick.  (Even in ""Quickfix"" she doesn't really get into proper form, but she teaches you enough so you won't feel lost.)

If you want to start kickboxing for the first time, and you are in good shape from working- out regularly, I'd suggest starting with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kathy-Smith-Kickboxing-Workout/dp/0738920533/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kathy Smith - Kickboxing Workout</a>.  It's got a good steady pace to keep your heart- rate up, while taking the time teach you proper punching and kicking form.  Kathy Smith is the main instructor, but she has a multi- titled kickboxing champion with her.  He gets a side window on your TV screen to teach proper form for every kick and punch.  Once you know the moves, the champ offers an extra kickboxing challenge in the ""choose your workout"" section of the DVD.  It's two combos that will really get you moving.

If you are not in shape, but want to get into kickboxing, I'd suggest starting with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Extreme-Makeover-Fitness-Weight-Loss-Workout-for-Beginners/dp/B0002YLCJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Extreme Makeover Fitness - Weight Loss Workout for Beginners</a>.  Although there are only a couple boxing moves used in this workout, it will get you into shape so you can move on to the challenging kickboxing DVDs.

2353149,5,B000A2XC5S,"I have been working out regularly for over 16 years and buying a variety of exercise DVDs based on good reviews, and this is one of the best and I feel so blessed to have found this one.  It is a solid, challenging workout and so much fun, I'm addicted to it.  Normally I try to rotate the exercise, from kick-boxing to weight lifting, yoga, hip-hop dance, etc., but this DVD is so much fun, I want to do this all the time.  I am a petite person but this exercise makes me feel empowered, confident, and just feeling good about myself in every way.  Janis Saffell is an excellent instructor with good cues.  The music is fun and uplifting.  Since I've been working out with this DVD, my husband has complimented that my butts got noticeably toned, so the results are there.",1207180800,,773,4.370629370629371
2353150,5,B000A2XC5S,"I love Janis Saffel. This video is a blast and I'm always sore the next day! Also, it's great if you like to work out with a buddy. There is a whole section that you can do with a partner or alone.",1203379200,,197,3.7142857142857144
2353151,4,B000A2XC5S,"I enjoyed this workout a lot more than the ""quick fix"" one.  This is geared more toward intermediate exercisers.  It was very easy to follow, and I broke a light sweat.  Janis demonstrates how the moves can be made easier or more difficult.  I think I will be feeling the squats tomorrow!  Overall, a well made exercise dvd, just not super challenging for a cardio workout.",1201305600,,373,4.590909090909091
2353172,3,B000A2XC5S,"Im an avid TaeBo user who feels Billy's latest videos have been a little on the easy side. I was excited about Strike Zone because a lot of the reviews here said the DVD kicked their butt. I found the cardio section less challenging than TaeBo; the toning session did not tax my muscles at all.

This DVD will be in my rotation of workouts, but only when I want to take it easy for the day. The footwork is more complex here, but overall, TaeBo is better to rev up my cardio.",1200182400,,475,4.10752688172043
2353173,5,B000A2XC5S,I like to work out at home. I enjoyed this DVD. I recommend it to intermediate level women who like to work out at home. It makes you work on your kicks. You feel all your body working. The only thing that I did not like is: It does not make me sweat too much. It is a fun work-out. Enjoy it!,1197244800,,292,3.725806451612903
2353174,5,B000A2XC5S,"I work out 4 to 5 days a week and was getting bored with my work out.  I bought the DVD hoping for a good fat burning workout, and I got one.  The indtructions are easy to follow, and Janis even gives demonstrations throughout. I woke up the next day sore in my middle and lower back and upper abs.  I never thought I would get that from a DVD!!  I do suggest that if you have lower back problems, not doing the whole DVD in one workout like I did.  Good Luck!!",1194134400,,461,3.913978494623656

2353176,5,B000A2XC5S,"I did this workout this morning for the first time and I love it!  I am a big kickboxing fanatic and 2 of my favorite kickboxing workouts are from Janis Saffell.  I love ""Quick Fix: Cardio Kick "" and ""Hardcore Kickbox Circuit.""  For me, this workout ranks right up there with them.  There is enough variety in the moves that I don't feel like I purchased the same workout from her.  I just received ""Kick it"" as well and haven't done it yet.  I watched it and am looking forward to adding it to my rotation as well.",1188950400,,515,4.204081632653061
2353177,5,B000A2XC5S,"This is a really awesome, but hard work out. I just love it!! The DVD is divided into five (5) sections. First part: A good warm-up. Second part: A regular kickboxing class. Third part: target practice with a partner, if you want to. The Fourth part: A strenght and conditioning section.  Fifth part: A light cool down.

You will sweat during and after this work-out. You work out for just about 1 hr. and in that time you will work every part of your body. Janis is a great instructor, but if you have no previous kickboxing experience you may be a little confused. Do what you can, and you will get better after each time you do the dvd. I could see changes in my body after just a few times and I feel full of energy after I am done. This is a true 5 star workout.",1188259200,,767,4.140939597315437
2353178,5,B000A2XC5S,This workout is fast paced and very energetic.  She has a good attitude and is very encouraging.  Great moves you can pick up quickly.,1188172800,,134,4.541666666666667
2353179,5,B000A2XC5S,I have done Janis in the past and I think this workout is great. It's not to hard or exhausting. You can keep up and still feel good. I highly recommend.,1187827200,,153,3.967741935483871

2353181,5,B000A2XC5S,"I love this kickboxing video and recommend it for anyone trying to tone and lose weight.  Janis has a fun sense of humor with her workout which makes her enjoyable to watch while working out.  Also,her background credentials are reflected as she constantly reminds you how to correctly do a move.  I definitely recommend this workout to all levels.  The gloves provide a tougher workout for the intermediate to advance clients.",1175299200,,427,4.971830985915493

2353203,4,B000A2XC5S,"I really enjoy her videos, she doesn't hold back. This isn't for beginners, but once you are ready for it Strike Zone is a must have for kick boxing lover. What I didn't like was the time break down. She starts with a great 6 min warm up and then goes into cardio routines. They are not difficult to follow and she uses her own brand of weighted gloves. Unfortunately as far as I can tell you can not purchase these anywhere. I use Everlast and they are too big for me and they get entirely too sweaty. The cardio section is about 23 mins long. She then goes into target practice with her own target paddle, also not commercially available as far as I can tell. Even without the paddle or a partner you can get some good practice in. Following this she goes into strength training...This is why I gave this video 4 stars...this part was boring. The cool down is also too slow for my taste. Janis is a great instructor, she makes alot of noise and is encouraging. My only beef is she tends to say ""ok this is going to be like a round house kick"" when what she means is ""this is a round house kick"" there is no like about it.",1174608000,,1123,4.155963302752293

You are constantly moving, even during the strength training, so you get some awesome cardio in. If you are a true beginner to working out, this video may be a bit tough, but once you've been working out a month or two, I think this is a great addition to your weekly routine.",1173312000,,385,3.948717948717949
2353205,5,B000A2XC5S,This is the first kickboxing DVD I've bought. I think she does a great job giving instructions and keeping it moving. Not too complicated either.,1172534400,,145,4.84
2353206,5,B000A2XC5S,"I'd say that I'm in pretty good shape, and this video still made me sweat! The strikezone portion of this DVD keeps you moving for about 27 minutes straight and you'll really feel the burn and get your heart rate up.

Because I sometimes like to go for about 40 to 50 minutes, I'll pop in Janis' QuickFix Total Cardio Kick DVD, and go through one or two of those 10-minute sessions to end my work-out.

But I would highly recommend this DVD. I'm a former dancer and the kicks still made me work! You won't be disappointed with it.

My only complaint is Janis' hair. Frosted blonde. Ew. Glad to see she fixed it for the Quick Fix DVD.",1170374400,,633,4.258333333333334
2353207,5,B000A2XC5S,"This is great for really working up a sweat and the benefits to your legs and butt are fabulous!  challenging movements without the weight and once you gainthe balance and strength to do the movments add weights and relly feel another level of burn.  helped me get from a 16 to a 12 right before i became pregnant.

fantastic.",1169856000,,326,4.491525423728813
2353208,2,B000A2XC5S,Not very challenging at all. Music is low and out-dated. Moves are simple and slow. Not for someone who exercises regularly.,1168300800,,124,4.9523809523809526
2353209,5,B000A2XC5S,This exercise video is my favorite.  You definitely will work up a sweat and as Janis Saffell will tell you it is not for sissys.  That shouldn't scare away any intermediate exercisers though.  Janis explains each move well and you can work your way up to the more advanced moves.  I especially liked the focused strength section.  You really feel it in your butt and thighs.  The results are encouraging and keep you coming back for more.,1168300800,,439,4.636363636363637
2353210,5,B000A2XC5S,"I LOVE this DVD. I use it twice a week at home. I was a devout gym rat but not seeing any changes, becasue I was stuck in the same rut. I added this DVD in and things started changing. You do a lot of side to side and kicking that you don't do in every day movement or on an gym equipment. Janis is a great instructor. keeps you going without being too ""perky"" or ""overly enthusiastic."" I have ordered a few other DVD's of hers since purchasing this one.",1167955200,,454,4.0
2353211,4,B000A2XC5S,"I'm not an avid kickboxing person but I use it for variety.  I have Janis's Quick Fix CD and neither of these are the same as far as moves so you can own both and be challenged.  I enjoy the segmenting aspect of the CD starting with cardio, then drills, and then strength so the user can select from 1-2 or 3 sets and then cool down.

The set is too small for the amount of people or vice versa and they were jammed in which doesnt allow you to see a low - med- or high impact version of the moves which would be nice.  Some of the participants were not coordinated to Janis, the beat or themselves and looked awkward and often left in the dust- very obvious so.

Overall, this is a great DVD and buy her Quick Fix (40min) and you'll have a nice inventory.",1160524800,,756,4.046979865771812
2353247,5,B000A2XC5S,"I have been excercising regularly for some time, but have started kick-boxing quite recently. I really enjoyed Kelly Roberts' 10-minute solution kickboxing but found that even with the whole workout done together, I wasn't getting a sustained cardiovascular component--I definitely got my sustained cardio with the Strike Zone! I find this workout lots of fun with no annoying aspects to it.  In a way, I almost wish I could do the kickboxing drills before the cardio segment because the technique is very well explained there, but other than that, I have no reservations. Except for advanced kickboxers, I think most folks will get a good workout with Strike Zone--I hope to see myself drop a few pounds over the next few weeks!!",1151625600,,730,4.983606557377049
2353248,5,B000A2XC5S,"This is my second Janis Saffell DVD (I also own Quick Fix Cardio Kick), and it's quickly become a favorite.  I was intimidated by the length of the workout before I tried it, but I found that it moves quickly and is actually a lot of fun!  Janis is very good at breaking down and cueing the moves.  I'm fairly new to kickboxing, and I didn't have much trouble keeping up with this workout at all.  I would recommend a more introductory DVD to learn the ""basics"" before trying this one, though.  All in all, this DVD (plus a set of hand grips) works up a great sweat and gets you toned, too!",1147824000,,590,4.185840707964601
2353249,3,B000A2XC5S,"Just purchased this video after reading great reviews.  Used it for the first time last night. Let me preface this by saying I am a huge fan of the Billy Blanks Tae Bo and have managed to amass myself a little library of those DVDs!  I thought I would try something a little different.  This DVD is ""good"" - as I said to my husband when he walked in mid-workout, ""eh, it's ok"".  The instructor is up beat and not too cheesy, as can sometimes be the case with workout videos.  I didn't feel the same intensity that you get from Billy, but then again, some people say he is ""too intense"", so that can be purely preference.  I did find that I used a lot of the technique I've learned with Billy's discs on Janis' disc, otherwise, I just didn't feel like I was doing it ""right"".

There isn't a lot of stretching in the warm-up section, but it does get you going.  If you like to be stretched out first, you best do this on your own before popping in the disc.  The first full section wasn't bad - not great, but not bad.  I agree with other reviewers in that the handweights definitely help maximize the workout.  I feel it would be almost worthless without them...but then again, I use them on all of my Billy discs as well, even the ones where he doesn't, so I'm accumstomed to and expect that extra ""umph"" they provide to a workout.  Personally, I did not care for the section with the paddle.  I work out alone, so I didn't feel like I got the full effect from that.  I found myself filling in with moves from other discs to fill the time.  I may try using the heavy bag as a ""partner"" next time to see if that works better.  The third section was my favorite.  I liked the combinations.  I felt like I got the most out of this section.  The cooldown is very nice, again, not really a lot of ""stretching"", but cools you down.

All in all, this isn't a bad tape, it just wasn't my favorite.  The instructor is easygoing enough and everything is easy to follow.  I definitely worked up a sweat, but I do get harder workouts with some of the Billy discs.  It's a decent addition to the library and I will use it again, I'm just not sure how often.",1144108800,,2144,4.188264058679707
2353250,5,B000A2XC5S,"When I first started doing kickboxing, I had trouble finding kickboxing videos that I really enjoyed.  Some were two hi-low aerobics-oriented, others have lacked fun variations and kick-punch combos, and still others contained too mainly elements I didn't want (eg, the floor work in most Tae Bo videos). However, with Janis Saffell's Kickbox Strike Zone, I may have finally found a near-perfect kickboxing video.  What I liked so much about this workout is that it's pure kickboxing: regardless of whether you're warming up, doing cardio, or focusing on toning, you're always combining punches and kicks. In addition, although the video provides an excellent, sustained cardio workout, there is virtually no jumping, so it is almost completely low impact. Furthermore, the workout is great for those (like myself) who have trouble following complicated choreography, as the moves are very simple: most of the time, you are moving either your upper OR your lower body rather than trying to coordinate both together.  Also, Janis introduces new moves at a slightly slower pace before picking up the intensity.

The workout begins with a 5 minute warmup. In this section, you move through slower-paced kicks, knee raises, lunges, and just a few push-ups. Next comes the kickboxing cardio section, which totals about 20 minutes. In this segment, you begin by focusing mainly on punches with a few kicks and knee raises thrown in, but eventually, you concentrate more on kicks, including front, back, side, roundhouse, and hook (which is rarely included in kickboxing videos). Jumping jacks are added inbetween some of the moves, but you can easily substitute marching if you want to keep the workout completely low-impact. The cardio work ends with a few squats to provide additional toning benefits.  The next segment consists of 16 minutes of kickboxing drills. These are performed using a partner who is holding a target; I simply imagined a target, and not having a partner just meant that I repeated each routine to double my workout. I really enjoyed this section, as it provided a great opportunity to intently focus on my form for both my punches and my kicks (there are no combinations in this section). Following the drills, there is an additional 10 minutes of standing toning work, mainly knee lifts and squats combined with punches and kicks. The workout ends with a 5 minute Tai Chi stretch for a total running time of 56 minutes.

Although I think that those new to kickboxing would be able to follow along with this workout, I would recommend starting with a more teaching-oriented video (such as Kathy Smith's Kickboxing Workout) and then moving on to this one as soon as you know the basics. However, I find Janis Saffell to be an excellent instructor; she offers great form reminders and models flawless form herself. She and the 8 background exercisers really look like they are enjoying themselves and getting into the workout. They all use 1-lb. weighted gloves during the workout (with the exception of the warmup, drills, and cool-down sections), and I am able keep up fine wearing my own 1-lb. gloves.

I'm confident that I will continue to use this video frequently over time to provide me with a great cardio AND toning workout. Highly recommended!",1143504000,,3272,5.036968576709796
2353251,5,B000A2XC5S,This is very easy to follow even if you have never used a kickbox video before.,1142812800,,79,4.0
2353252,4,B000A2XC5S,"You can always count on Janis to make it fun yet give great form in kickboxing.  The workout is good but it wouldn't be ""intermediate/advanced"" as advertised without the addition of wearing the 1 - 2 lb. handweights.  The target drills are really different and great fun; something I've never had in a workout video.  It was easy to focus on one of the paddles, despite the movement of the camera around the room, and use it as a target.  This workout was different from the usual kickbox videos, with attention to corret form, and Janis' enthusiasm made it enjoyable throughout the entire program.  I definitely recommend it.",1141516800,,626,4.7592592592592595
2353253,5,B000A2XC5S,"At first I didn't feel that this was an advanced enough workout, but within a week people could notice the difference, especially in my arms.  I loev the attitude of Janis and the crew.  It makes you feel upbeat!",1141084800,,212,4.410256410256411
2353254,4,B000A2XC5S,"Kickbox Strikezone includes several segments (these are my names for them, not necessarily what you'll see on the DVD's menu):

1.  Kickbox Warm-up (mild kickboxing moves are used to warm up the body and start bringing up the heart rate).

2.  Kickbox Cardio (kicks and punches along with boxer shuffle, bob & weave, jumping jacks and such get you sweating and keep the heart rate up).

3.  Kickbox Technique (technical instruction on kicking and punching using a paddle and a partner but, if you don't have either, you can follow the 2 solo women and do fine).

4.  Kickbox Toning (using kickbox-type moves to tone the legs, hips and buns and work on balance--lots of balancing on one leg while you work muscles of the leg/hip/buns).

5.  Kickbox Cool-down (t'ai chi cool-down with breathing and stretching).

Pros:
1.  Janis really seems to know her stuff when it comes to kickboxing and she has a great amount of passion for it.

2.  The toning section is very effective--it's one of those workouts that you feel WHILE you're doing it as well as the next day.  Great buns work.

3.  If you find Tae-bo too intense, this is a good kickboxing workout, and you will sweat, but it's not as intense as Tae-bo.  For me, that's a good thing--I like Tae-bo now and then, but find it too intense for a regular gig.

4.  I was turned off by the paddle section the first time I did this, because it SEEMED to require equipment and a partner, neither of which I had.  However, on subsequent viewing, I realized that she has two women doing the technical workout without either a paddle OR a partner and I actually didn't feel like I was missing anything by following them vs. the pairs.  I really appreciated that she provided this alternative.

Cons:
1.  Until you get to the technique (3rd) section, there isn't much/any clear instruction on how to move your body while you're punching (i.e., that punching isn't just about your arms, but involves your whole body).  If you're a beginner, I'd suggest starting with at least a review of the paddle (technique) section before doing the workout.

2.  Janis has a good-sized crew of people working out with her, but they're all so jammed together that you never really get to see anyone but the first few people in the front.  Especially for a kickboxing workout, this seemed like REALLY bad planning.  One tall guy toward the back couldn't even extend his kicks because he was too close to the woman in front of him.  Maybe that's the only space Janis could afford, but I would have rather seen less people doing the workout and have them spread out so they could really do (and show) their stuff.

3.  This is just a personal preference thing for me--I love punching and don't care for kicking quite as much.  I would have loved this workout to be a bit less focused on kicking, though I understand that it's a lot easier to keep the heart rate up with kicking than it is with punching.  There are times when the kicking goes on too long (again, for my taste).

4.  I wish the cardio section was longer.

5.  I've edited my review to add this, which only came to light when I didn't do the whole workout for the first time recently.  The cooldown is the only segment of the DVD that isn't available to be chosen from the menu--this is really annoying to people who may not have time to do the whole workout.  You can't even use the ""next segment"" button on your DVD remote to get to it.  You have to go to the last segment before cooldown and fast forward to it, which is a waste of time (when you're limited on time in the first place).  What a major disappointment!",1140998400,,3608,4.487692307692308
2353255,5,B000A2XC5S,"This DVD is a lot of work and it's about an hour long but it is a great workout.  Exhausting, good cardio and strength.  I highly recommend it.  The only problem I have with these DVD's is that I never really know if I am doing it right!",1140652800,,237,3.8958333333333335
2353256,5,B000A2XC5S,"Finally, a way to get in a strength workout while doing cardio!  The handgrips make the workout challenging, but not impossible.  The workout is on the advanced side, but I think it is suitable for anyone; beginners can work without the gloves.  Take it easy the first couple times; you will be sore.  Janis' instruction is superb, and the technique/drill section is a great way to keep your heart rate up while learning proper form.  Give it a try!",1138838400,,449,4.632911392405063
2353279,5,B000A2XC5S,"Get problems with saddle bags, flubber buns, and all the other unfortunate problems like them? This work out if used consistantly will take all that away. I used it for the first time and my buns are sore but that's how I know when something works really well. This is my third Saffell dvd and it's seems to be the best one so far. Only thing is after the warm up she says it's time to put your gloves on then 2 seconds later everone had the gloves on and the work out starts so you have to pause the dvd so you can put yours on. That's my only complaint.

Janis your amazing!!

I'd also recommend Hardcore Kickbox Circuit w/Guillermo Gomez. Guillermo, your awesome! And for beginners Total cardio Kick.",1136937600,,703,4.358778625954199
2353280,5,B000A2XC5S,"Wow, that's all I can say!  I am an avid home workout person for several years and this video kicked my butt (and back from all the hooks and jabs)!  I just recently discovered Janis Saffell and I am so impressed with what a great job she does in cueing and putting together an excellent workout.  I started with her Brand New Butt and More video and added the Hardcore Kickbox, Tai Chi Balanced Workout and Strike Zone.  Strike Zone I felt was the hardest workout and most difficult, being new to kickbox.  I would highly recommend Janis' videos, particularly this one.  Despite my dedication to Minna Lessig's videos, Denise Austin's Personal Training and the Bar Method (all of which I think are great), I really like the results I am seeing in my legs and elsewhere from Janis Saffell.  Five stars!!",1129075200,,803,4.612676056338028
2353281,5,B000A2XC5S,"This is one of my favourite kickboxing workout Janis uses punches, and kicks to really get your heart rate up and then comes a short toning section with kicks and punches followed by a class for practicing punches and kicks. A light tai chi based cooldown ends the workout.

This is great workout for those who have some kickboxing experience or a lighter workout for the more advanced kickboxer. I love Janis style and she has a great teaching technique.

A well cued workout.",1126742400,,477,4.666666666666667

8073058,3,B000A2XC5S,I don't think that the instructor ever took a martial arts class.  It was a little annoying to watch her kick and punch like a cheerleader.  Ok if you don't have a martial background.,1394064000,,183,4.352941176470588
8073059,4,B000A2XC5S,Good instruction on a wide variety of kicks. The paddle work can be done without the paddles to complete satisfaction. Lots of kick work.,1360540800,,137,4.75
8073060,5,B000A2XC5S,"I LOVE this workout!  It's a nice break from the FIRM workouts, and it only requires you.  No boxes to move, dumbbells to switch out, etc.  You can follow it slowly as a beginner, or really amp it up with weighted gloves and/or a partner.  She looks like one of those annoying Barbie types, but she is NOT.  lol  I love her attitude, and the crew working in her class has someone from all levels.  No one's dressed the same, it's not synchronized like the videos full of trainers, and it's fun without being dance-y.  It really focuses on your strength and balance without wasting too many minutes explaining the kicks and punches.  Love it!",1353974400,,641,4.504347826086956
8073061,4,B000A2XC5S,"I am a huge fan of Turbo Jam with Chalene Johnson but I went to this DVD in search of something more ""back to basics"" kickboxing.  I really liked this DVD.  It's a little outdated and the music is average techno background noise but the moves and combos are interesting and different and includes more advanced kicks than my other DVDs.  I am really pleased with this purchase and look forward to rotating it into my routine regularly.",1308873600,,435,4.551282051282051

8073063,2,B000A2XC5S,"I think this is a good workout if you are new to exercise or cardio kickboxing. I saw all the great reviews and bought it, but I think that it's going on to ebay. The paddle section bothers me, because even if I did want to buy these paddles to practice kicks on, I don't have anyone here that would want to hold them for me. I think maybe that section should be part of an instructional or bonus selection on the dvd.",1254528000,,418,4.048192771084337
8073064,3,B000A2XC5S,"This is a good workout DVD and I do recommend it.  However, there are so many people in this DVD.  What is the need to have 2 giant men (plus one more) and 4 buffed up women (plus 2 more) in this DVD?  It feels like 100 people in this DVD.  It looks bit freakish like some sort workout demo in shopping mall.",1254009600,,308,3.8412698412698414
8073065,5,B000A2XC5S,"Ahhh! This is a great video.  It is very challenging if you focus on technique; if it's not hard, then you're probably not doing it right!  I like Saffell's instruction style and personality, and she has a good sense of when to push it more and when enough is enough.  I usually get bored with a video after a couple of run throughs, but I can see myself using this at LEAST once a week.  I mix it up with running outside and gym work, so I'm not totally dependant on videos.

You won't regret this one!",1245715200,,503,4.144329896907217
