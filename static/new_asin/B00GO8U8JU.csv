8625325,1,B00GO8U8JU,"This DVD is not playable on a North American DVD player. The DVD they provided is licensed and zoned only to play in the EU. It even says on the DVD sleeve that it is not to be exported outside of the EU. So unless they actually got a specific license to sell it to me, they would have violated the EU and USA license and trademark laws. Nice. My main irritation is that they sold me a DVD that is not playable here in the USA where I purchased it on the Amazon USA website.",1500854400,,474,3.9479166666666665
