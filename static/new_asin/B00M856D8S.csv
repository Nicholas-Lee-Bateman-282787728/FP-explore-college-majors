6564438,5,B00M856D8S,The only problem I have with it is it's too short!!! Great DVD!!!,1419465600,,65,4.076923076923077
6564439,5,B00M856D8S,"Y'all be settle down and get with this...Mr. Rahsaan Patterson is da truth and all of his genius is on display on his first live release.  It is long overdue and I am so glad that he continues to share his gift with the world.  This dvd is money well spent and will leave you wanting more, so cop the dvd and a few copies of his cd's.  Then go check him out in person when he is performing in a city near you.  You will not be disappointed.",1417737600,2,440,3.9101123595505616
6564440,5,B00M856D8S,"Songs contained in this 62 minute collection are ""Burnin'""/""So Hot"", ""6AM"" (featuring Lalah Hathaway), ""Crazy (Baby)"" (featuring Shanice Wilson), ""Spend The Night"", ""Can't We Wait A Minute"", ""Feels Good"" and ""Where You Are."" Professionally filmed at the Belasco Theater in Los Angeles one week after his 2011 release ""Bleuphoria"" was released, this DVD features Lalah Hathaway not only on vocals, but also on keyboards. The rest of the talented performers on these songs are Derrick D*Loc Walker on drums, Javad Day on keyboards, David Balfour on keyboards, Jairus Mozee on guitar, Raymond McKinley on bass, Jenny Takamatsu and Ina Veli on violins, Vanessa Freebairn-Smith on cello, Michael Whitson on viola, string arrangements by Randy Waldman and last but most definitely not least, backing vocals by Trina Broussard, Angela Fisher and Jason Morales.

I love Rahsaan's studio work, but where he truly shines is as a live performer. I have twice flown to different cities to see him perform live. He is an incredibly gifted vocalist and he always gives the audience his all. This DVD is a bargain at $10, and Rahsaan is the kind of person you want to support as much as you can. So instead of ordering that pizza you were thinking about all day -- order something that's good for your soul -- a musical performance that will bring you enjoyment for years to come.

Note to Artistry/Mack Avenue: What took so long to put this out? You've been withholding this goodness for 3+ years from us! Put out the Blu-Ray and I'll buy it again.",1412553600,4,1534,4.8961538461538465

6564450,5,B00M856D8S,"If you like fine dining then this is a audio banquet to satisfy the fussiest soul appetites. Rahsaan glides, swoops, plays with his voice like a child having fun with a shiny new red kite!. It's such a pleasure and inspiration to see someone loving music the way he does. I like too that he lets the songs simmer nicely without rushing them. That sense of space and playfulness is really what makes this a wonderful 5 star video. Long overdue. Best we pray he tours nearby soon (Sydney Australia for me). This is a talent that just keeps on giving. I LOVE this dvd, I really do. As a vocalist and musician myself this is a masterclass in vocal, musical sophistication. This makes me very happy. Thank you Rahsaan. Buy this DVD without risk, it's great!",1422230400,,752,4.4963503649635035

8670664,5,B00M856D8S,"I had the pleasure of seeing Rahsaan Patterson last year at Center Stage in Atlanta, GA.  All I can say is ""AWESOME CONCERT"".  He brought vocal styling to a new level.  It was actually the first time I had heard his music, or so I thought. ""So Hot"" was one of my favorite songs from the movie ""Two Can Play That Game"" but I didn't know that was Rah.  When I saw him in concert, needless to say, I went back and purchased all of his music including this DVD.  I love this DVD, it shows his range and styling that ONLY he can produce.  The appearance of Ms. Lalah Hathaway during the show made this project most appealing. I would definitely recommend this DVD and all of his music to my friends and family!",1457913600,,705,4.185185185185185
