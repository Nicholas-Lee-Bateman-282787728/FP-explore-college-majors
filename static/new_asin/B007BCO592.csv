5073245,5,B007BCO592,"Terrorist are able to steal some plastic explosives from British Intelligence. The British have placed a tracer in the Semtex explosives. When a terrorist uses the explosives, Charlotte Rampling (Charlotte McQueen) of the agency asks agent Ewan (Sean Bean) to do whatever is necessary to find the terrorists, even going beyond standard protocol. Mark (Tom Burke) will be his young assistant.

Meanwhile, we do get to see our terrorist in a subplot. It starts six years ago and goes into his indoctrination and transformation. The film let's us see the conflict within the Muslim community as those who see the west as evil, those who destroy and rape their culture. And then there are those who admire the west for its freedom and opportunities it affords people of all religions.

This is one of the better British crime/drama/thrillers I have seen, primarily because they have imitated American films and have stopped trying to do them the British way with quirky humor and characters that didn't fit the rest of the script. Americans like their crime heroes to have above human qualities. Sean Bean gives us the rogue agent we love. Good script. Good acting. Action, mystery, drama, and the usual twist. 4 1/2 stars.

PARENTAL GUIDE: F-bomb, sex, and nudity (Tuppence Middleton).",1342828800,16,1282,5.037735849056604
5073246,5,B007BCO592,"I picked up an advanced copy and thought it was going to be a typical British movie which I do not like. I was pleasantly surprised how very good it was.

The story is interesting. It had plenty of twists and turns that kept me interested throughout keeping your interest up until the end. Some of the story, I thought could have used some work, for example, a fundamentalist Muslim cleric is unlikely to be too excited about going to his boy birthday party. If he did, he would not mention it publicly. The scene, however, is important as it shows the attitude the cleric has to his disciple. To the people that organise suicide bombers, these people are a weapon, not people. Some of the other scenes on recruitment to Islamic terrorism seemed a bit too simple - Hollywoodish. Still overall it was well done. It showed a young muslim guy looking for something and how he gets drawn to terrorism.

The acting was good. The characters are interesting. I did like the fighting scenes too. They were much more realistic then what movies often now days of a young skinny woman who takes on he-man and wins.

I would recommend it.",1342396800,16,1126,4.536945812807882
5073247,2,B007BCO592,Too much propaganda in this film to make us feel sorry for the Muslim terrorists.  The Western governments are not saints but neither are the Muslims.  On a side note - this is one of the few Sean Bean films where he actually lives (LOL).  The action scenes were ok and that's why I gave it two stars.,1526774400,,301,4.155172413793103

5073250,4,B007BCO592,"A decent, old-school spy movie, sans CG, dragons or wizards, thankfully or car chases.  It was semi message neutral, as far as political hit pieces go.  The outcome was presented early and kicked around throughout.

Overall the film was enjoyable with solid production values, acting, decent but galvanizing story/ script..heavy on the justice and retribution message, with a little of both being served at English room temp.. like gazpacho that's sat out on the counter a bit..good flavor and still edible.  Fresh cilantro and lime is key, I think.",1525564800,4,549,5.134831460674158
5073251,3,B007BCO592,"I gave it barely 3 stars because it is not horrible but it is not good.  They spent way too much time letting the Muslim terrorists go on and on about how abused they are, raving about the West killing ""their brothers and sisters"" but interestingly  said nothing about how they slaughter each other by the millions.  None of the characters were developed enough for the audience to get to know and care about them.  They tried to tell too many stories and ended up just serving us a mish mash.

I spent the first 90% of the film trying to figure out what was going on, and the remaining 10% wishing I could somehow get my 108 minutes back.  This movie represents radical Islamic terrorists (suicide bombers, etc.) as heroic patriots, who do what they do, only because they've been forced into a corner by the evil west (specifically, the US and UK).  Cleanskin was released in the US in 2012 on September 11th, with the tagline, ""Fight fire with fire"", and was both written and directed by Hadi Hajaig.",1524009600,4,612,4.545454545454546

5073265,2,B007BCO592,"I knew this was going to be a waste of my time. I knew it! I knew it! But I figured why not. Why not watch it and see how it would come out. It had a decent plot with some decent acting all around. But it gets muddled and thrown around. The ending was absolute rubbish. I don't care about spoiling as the leader of the cell gets deported which dosen't matter to this type of person as he will likely find a way back in or brain wash other people to do his bidding. The ending would have been better if the wedding party explosion was more towards the begging of the middle and the cop finds out that was only the begging. Then he finds the tape from the undercover agent he burned to death; which could have been prevented if  he wasn't an idiot. That would lead the cop to source of the cell where he takes them all out and finds more evidence to the woman at the end of the movie. Basically, edit a lot of the movie and add a lot more detective work and taking down the cell. Whom ever wrote this needs to go read the Jack Ryan series by Tom Clancy before writing another movie like this.",1523491200,,1090,4.023041474654378

The movie is made very well but most of the movie promotes anger towards Muslims and Muslims anger towards others. I think the movie was made to show the futility of it all but the message comes too late at the end of the movie. Now to watch the predictable end. Update: satisfying ending,  but movie still provokes hatred towards muslims and distrust of government.",1521244800,,578,4.443396226415095
5073287,2,B007BCO592,"The trivia section reveals that the movie director's intention was (emphasis on was) to make a commercial thriller. I think he fell short of that. Fortunately, the movie isn't a political manifesto either. As far as Sean Bean's performance -well, let's say that Arnie Schwarzenegger has far more versatility as an actor. Charlotte Rampling used to be a beauty on screen. Now she resembles my dead grandmother; thus, her character as a British Secret Service top manager doesn't get to suspend my disbelief.

5073288,4,B007BCO592,"Whether you like this story depends on two things I believe.  First, do you like strong, brooding, tormented male leads.  If you do, then Sean Bean plays such role for adeptly.  The second is how many times have you seen a spy-special operations story.  Here Bean is set loose on London after a screw up by him allows a bomber to gain access to Semtex.  The bomber is Muslim, and Bean is not a gentle man so this allows the director to consider some of the implications of terror and torture.  There are twists, but, if you seen other movies like this, I'm not sure how surprising they will be to you or, alternatively, that you will view them as particularly well-done.  They're not badly done; they just weren't stellar to me personally so, on occasion, I found myself urging the movie to get on with it.

5073309,4,B007BCO592,"Good flick, well acted. Very politicized and hypocritical in the Islamic view. Writers did well to show how out of touch with reality these Islamic killers and Islamic religious followers are.

Two of the actors showed the following in glaring detail......

With over 10 thousand years of tribal warfare, decimating whole civilizations, the Islamic mindset plays the short memory game in modern times. These Islamic people have rather short memories when it comes to atrocities and what they start when they see something they do not like, they do not agree with, or offends them. Then they become supremely offended and hatefully, violently angry that other countries would intervene while they kill themselves and others and try to spread their religious ideals. The Islamics play the victim card and it is so laughable some get away with it.

Pure Hypocrites, all of Islam. Blame everyone but themselves. Sure, the western countries have been just as brutal to them recently and decidedly so. What Islam represents should never be allowed to spread and the short memories of these Islamics need to be reminded everyday who ultimately started the bloodshed that has carried over thousands of years, and contniues to this day because of their short memories and one sided views.....them. And they hate to be reminded of it.

We can all remember the way the middle east looked like in the early 70's, a paradise of Islamic making, culture, science, medicine, doing their own thing, until a few radical students under the tutorship of a certain radical imam destroyed that paradise while the world sat back and watched as books were burned, western culture was removed through killings and strict sharia law and now we have what we have today,  a cesspool of infighting, blaming, pointing the finger and religious killers running around trying to spread their filth to our countries and kill in the process.

The truly incredible thing, is while all that was happening, the majority of the Muslim world sat and watched and said nothing. People wonder why western countries got involved? To prevent that BS from spreading enmasse. So blame the western countries for todays atrocities on your people, but blame yourselves for starting it, and be mad because we will not allow your hate and religion to spread and turn the rest of the world into the cesspool you Muslims created for yourselves.

Yes the west has a heavy hand and when dealing with hypocrites with short memories, it is needed.",1519516800,2,2489,4.983132530120482

5073352,5,B007BCO592,"Like other reviewers, I did not have high expectations for this movie, but after watching it I thought it was excellent.

Aside from the action and violence, which was well done and very realistic, two things stood out to me:

1. The gradual and deliberate process of Islamic recruitment of young men to become killers and terrorists.  Other reviewers have commented on the process and spelled it out in detail, but as a historian it was interesting how the recruiter continually preaches to his recruits how England (and by extension the West in general) has demeaned and killed Muslims.  There is, of course, no balance in his preaching, no mention of anything good that the West has done, and especially there is no mention of the massive demeanings and killing that Muslims have inflicted on others throughout history.  Such actions are or would be completely excused because they are supposedly commanded by Allah, and done by those with ""pure hearts,"" even though the real goal has usually been power for the leaders.  In other words, it is the old story of using religion as a mask for gaining power.

2. The corruption of high government officials, and the careful plotting to remove those who would truly fight terrorism by those who are complicit with it and have been bought off.  Funded by organizations like CAIR (the Council on American and Islamic Relations), they are like Charlotte, Sean Bean's boss who he kills at the end of the movie in an ultimate act of judgment on one of the people who is most guilty (with her mansion and money probably supplied by Islamic groups).  But that is a ""Hollywood ending,"" and doesn't usually happen in the real world.",1455321600,,1671,4.794425087108014

NetFlix Instant Download Streaming. The writer and director is Hadi
Hajaig. For me, Sean (aka 'Ewan') puts on a fantastic performance, in a
film where I was also very impressed with Peter Polycarpou (aka
'Nabil'). The romance between Ash and Kate felt very believable, not
all actors/actresses can pull this job off. It was a film that touches
on a very serious subject, so for all you rom-com addicts, prob not one
for you, lol! However, although a serious topic, you'll find some light
hearted humor in parts of the film. Have already recommended to friends
and family, purchased on DVD myself, so go and watch too if you already
haven't. Overall, a great watch with some excellent action shots and
twists and turns throughout. I gave it 8 stars. Dale Haufrect",1433548800,,834,4.758620689655173
5073356,4,B007BCO592,"""CLEANSKIN"" for all its apparent action  is not an action film; it is a moral story of moral failure and human tragedy by all concerned. What it depicts is a clear portrayal and indictment of what happens when the tactics one, or one's nation uses, to prevent or eradicate terror, seizes control of those doing so, transforming them into the very terror, terrorists and terrorism they are seeking to prevent. For when an individual or nation uses terror to fight terror, terror wins, no matter the immediate outcome, because the object of one's hatred becomes one's own broken nature in doing so. It is the classic moral example of two wrongs never making a right, as violence, terror and conflict only beget more of the same. Sean Bean's portrayal is brutal, dark and unforgiving as a man totally broken by what he has experienced, is experiencing and has become; as are all the characters in this film. And in the final scene when he realizes his own government is staging the very terror he is supposedly fighting, it speaks to the fact that what he was doing and had become was not ""in his nature,"" as his handler indicates, but what he had ""learned"" to become through this whole process. Ditto for all the other characters, as each is emotionally, morally and humanly perverted in some form or manner by the effect that fear and terror has on them to change their attitudes, their behaviors, or in the worst cases, their own humanity and morality. This will not be a popular film, and shouldn't be, because its content shows little or no moral  or human redemptive value for the individuals involved, or their nations, when dealing with terror in a terrible manner; and also for what happens when the ""fire"" one uses to fight ""fire"" becomes a larger more uncontrollable and destructive blaze in the process. No one in this film is ""pretty,"" and they shouldn't be, because there is nothing pretty about what is happening to them, what they are doing or how they are changing. Moral conflict and personal rage abound in this film, as good guy becomes bad; a good plan becomes evil, and good motives shape-shift into evil purposes, goals and outcomes. Don't look to this film for entertainment; its content is not entertaining; it is revealing, because it reveals what the ""war on terror"" has become--a ""war of terror"" that will never end--until the underlying political, religious and economic tensions, mistrust and failures of the past are not repeated into the present.",1429142400,,2475,4.793911007025761

Brit filmmakers are as bad or worse than American filmmakers i.e. paranoid leftists when it comes to making flicks about Islamic killers. Something doesn't seem right. Sure enough, I'm rewarded at the end of the  film with a healthy dose of moral equivalence (sure, Islamo-fascist killers are bad, but look at what evil things our leaders  do kind of thinking) which pretty much wrecks all the good carnage that happened previously. I guess I should be happy the flick actually depicted the savage Islamic killers as the depraved evil slime they are, but most leftist filmmakers being equally slimy,  (SPOILER ALERT!!!!) they had to involve the British government as accomplices. I'm surprised Bush and Cheney didn't make a surprise appearance at the end showing them setting off explosives in true truther  fashion.",1366675200,3,1149,5.194594594594594
5073378,5,B007BCO592,"CLEANSKIN stars Sean Bean as an anti-terrorism expert. The film chronicles the evolution of a British-born Muslim law student in London (""Ash"" played by Abhin Galeya) into a suicide bomber. It's filled with action, and it has you on the edge of your seat for a full two hours. It's by far the best commercial film I've seen on ""homegrown"" terrorist recruitment, practically a video handbook:

1. Recruiters for terror cells are like recruiters for any other cult---They seek out isolated, disaffected young people:

Ash is bright and handsome but feels alienated from his fellow law students, some of whom call him derogatory names. His recruitment starts with a bar fight over a girl.

2. The terror recruiters, rather than building up their recruits' sense of self-worth, break it down:

""You see?"" says the recruiter, an Imam, ""They call you a ""n****r""; they call you a ""Paki"", you will never be like them. You have been hated all your life. Look what they've done to you! You're weak! You can't make your own choices! Only a coward wants to be like his oppressor, and you are oppressed, and you are a coward!""

3. Then the recruiter extols membership in the cult:

""You are a member of an ancient civilization. An honorable civilization. You are not like them, with their decadent drinking, their music, their shameless women. You don't want to be like them...They are drunkards, they eat swine, they defile the sanctity of their bodies and their souls! There is not one decent one among them. They are not like us, they are worthless, they have no values, and they have no value even to themselves. If you are with us, you will have given up all that self-abuse. Be a man!""

4. The recruiter then globalizes the issue:

""And it is not just you. It is your brothers everywhere. In Chechnya. In Kosovo. In Palestine. In Iraq. In Afghanistan. They not only want to spread their decadence to you, here, but they want to spread their decadence all over this earth!""

5. The pitch:

""It is up to you to stop them!""

After Ash accompanies a more experienced terrorist on a local ""mission"" that ends in the decapitation of a husband, wife, and infant, the decision is made to send Ash overseas ""for more and better training."" He comes back a bombmaker. And even at that point, he moves among the population of London innocuously, he dates non-Muslim women, and nobody sees what's uncoiling inside him. At a half-dozen points he almost takes off his dynamite vest, but in the end, his own inadequacies, aided and abetted by his recruiters' constant exhortations, consume his entire life.

What's hopeful is that not everyone the recruiters approach falls for their ""You're a Victim!"" routine. What's less hopeful is that because the recruiters move among (and claim to be) members of a legitimate religious community, even the people who send the recruiters away tend to do nothing and say nothing to undermine what is obviously occurring.

I had never heard of CLEANSKIN (the title comes from the fact that Ash is an unknown terrorist without a history; he has ""clean skin""). I watched this, purely by chance, at a friend's house in the wake of the Boston bombing.  Idiots like the Tsarnaev brothers couldn't exist if there wasn't a conspiracy of silence in Islam. But we don't hear Imams coming out publicly decrying the violence and the loss of life in Boston and elsewhere. Muslims who do decry the violence are silenced or ignored, expelled from their communities, like Irshad Manji, or worse, like Salman Rushdie, given death sentences.

The fact is, these terrorists make up a cult, but it's a cult given legitimacy by its association with a legitimate religious structure. And it's a cult that few Muslims choose to challenge for fear of social ostracism or, worse, targeting by the cult.

But at least I understand the Tsarnaev brothers now. Their uncle was right. They're losers. Plain and simple.",1366502400,,3903,4.811659192825112
5073379,5,B007BCO592,"I never heard of this film and just fell across it from a recommendation.
Finally there are people out here that talk about the truth, and that's both sides are guilty as can be of making innocent by-standers the victims in the never ending ""blame game"" of pointing the finger at each other. This United States, that I'm a fifth generation citizen of I'm not proud of saying, is as guilty of killing more millions than ANY other country in the world. Just the Indians alone in this land points to 10's of millions we lied about, cheated and killed off with bullets, bombs or disease we planted in their food and blankets. It was our own government that issued money for Indian scalps I'm ashamed of saying.(note, I'm neither Indian or Arab, but I am Scottish and English for the record.)

I have little respect for most all of the middle eastern people that seem to love war, torture and fighting for thousands of years, and will never change, but I can clearly see the difference in right and wrong.
Now please help me with this. You strap a bomb to your side and kill 20 people and your a terrorist idiot, but the U.S. can use a drown airplane and kill off 50 people or carpet bomb a city slaughtering 650,000 (Baghdad) with in-discriminant bombing, and somehow were ""hero's"" and freedom fighters.
NO......NO..... both sides are killers and love to have any excuse to take human lives.

I'm glad for a film that at least implicates both sides, so that one day perhaps some of this will stop and sane people rule this world. As long as the United States keep listening to jewish people, and letting them dictate International policy for us and run our government, and get us into these battles, along with the greed for oil, then we have no chance to live in peace.

5073381,4,B007BCO592,"There appears to be a trend in the film industry to explore the concept of terrorism from both sides. This insightful film addresses this very concept of sharing with the audience the factors behind what encourages men to terrorist acts, especially those of suicide bombers who by their actions work with the concept that in carrying out such bombings to kill infidels they gain immediate access into Paradise with the concomitant virgins and joining deceased family and friends.

The title holds some clues as to the film's direction: `A `cleanskin' is a term for an undercover operative unknown to his or her targets, or, as more commonly used in the UK following the London bombings, an extremist with no previous convictions so therefore unknown to national security.' A strangely quiet man named simply Ewan (Sean Bean) is a rather ruthless British Secret Service Agent who with his partner Mark (Tom Burke) is directed by his superiors Charlotte (Charlotte Rampling) and Scott (James Fox), and faced with the task of pursuing and eliminating a British born Muslim suicide bomber Ash (Abhin Galeya) and his terrorist cell directed by Nabil (Peter Polycarpou). The complexities of misinformation and unnecessary murders and the use of flashbacks and flash forwards to help the viewer understand the motivations of each of the characters gives us a better view of the conflicted personalities of all involved. The process of pursuing the capture and the perpetration of the terrorist activity is full of surprising twists and turns and the resolution is entirely unexpected.

While the film focuses attention on Sean Bean as the name actor, the story really belongs to the very gifted young British actor Abhin Galeya who plays Ash, a handsome idealistic student in love with a non-Muslim girl Kate (Tuppence Middleton) who struggles with the concept of terrorism yet grows into a man with a terrifyingly single-minded mission. His relationship to his partner Yussif (Chris Ryman) and the influence of Nabil allows us to understand why terrorist suicide bombers gain their convictions.

The film was written and briskly directed by Hadi Hajaig. CLEANSKIN has much more to offer than mere entertainment: there is considerable investigation into the continuation of terrorist idealism and resultant activities both in England and in all parts of the world.

It gives a very in depth look at how everyday citizens are recruited to become terrorists. It shows a lot from their point of few. That part was very eye opening to me.

5073407,3,B007BCO592,"I have mixed feelings as I sit down to write this review of Cleanskin. I was drawn to the movie because of its setting in the UK, a somewhat different locale for a counterterrorism thriller, and because it featured Sean Bean(one of my favorite actors) in the leading role.

The first hour or so of the movie is pretty good, a solid four-star film as I state above, with a great deal of attention paid to the radicalization of a British-born Muslim law student, perhaps at the expense of developing Sean Bean's backstory. While this does become a key focus of the film, I fail to understand how other reviewers have come away with an impression of ""pro-Muslim bias"", given the rather sinister portrayal of the imam and the heinous deeds committed in the name of Islam throughout the course of the film. A rationalization process is always present, whether you're dealing with terrorists or serial killers--yet some people seem to feel the need to go into hysterics whenever such a process is explained and examined. I applaud the producers for taking the time to present a more careful, thoughtful treatment of the subject than is typically found in an action thriller.

That said, with roughly a half hour to go till the end, the movie completely derails into some sort of government conspiracy angle that is never fully explained and makes little sense when taken together with the rest of the film. The overall effect strikes one as a bit bizarre, and to be quite blunt, ruined a great deal of my enjoyment. I would also say that I thought Sean Bean was underutilized in the movie--I wanted to see more of him, know more about his character. But that didn't happen.

Ultimately, this was a film with a lot of unrealized potential and I found myself disappointed, despite some good moments early on. I would recommend anyone looking for a British spy film to instead check out a season of the BBC's TV show ""Spooks"" or ""MI-5"" as it is known here in the States.",1359072000,6,1961,4.645533141210374

Throughout the movie you feel as the characters do, that there is only going to be one chance to get it right, choices are made good or bad, and when its all over it may not be what you bargained for.

After seeing the end of the film I learned all violent Muslims were really good, honest feeling muslims who were tricked into do the terrible things they did by their leader who was really a bad muslim.  I learned that these politicians were doing all kinds of double cross so that my hero Bean is almost murdered himself.  The end of the movie seems to put a lot of time into why the main Muslim character is doing what he is doing because the British have been going around the world doing terrible things to Muslims.  Maybe this Movie was made for the real ""dummies"" in UK and USA and maybe other western countries.  Anyone with just a little bit of knowledge of the last 20 years knows that the vast amount of Muslim suffering is done by others who call themselves muslims.  Maybe this movie is just one political film that masguarades as an action movie and you have just been manipulated my some hidden group.

5073440,3,B007BCO592,"Sean Bean is slumming it a bit here in this relatively low budget British thriller, set in the world of counter terrorism.  In this context, Cleanskin is an extremist unknown to the security forces as they have no prior record or convictions.  Bean effortlessly plays the role of an ex serviceman now employed to do skulduggery by the government, his handler played by Charlotte Rampling of all people, who reports to James Fox.  All of whom seem out of place with the apparent low budget and straight to DVD feel of the movie.
Having said that, although the action scenes are well contained and feel real world-y, the more interesting part is the story, partly told in flashback, of how Ash (Abhin Galeya, who does very well) goes from UK student with anger management issues, to a terrorist willing to sacrifice his life.  His journey is the most interesting, by far, of the characters.  Bean does well enough, but he is on autopilot here, and how Rampling and Fox were persuaded to be in it is anybodys guess, though their very presence does lend a little class to the movie.  Still the action certainly rattles along, and the director never fails to make the most of an opportunity to show someone's brains being blown out in as much detail as possible.
There are plot holes all over the place, and the behaviour of some of the characters doesn't always make sense.  The introduction of Sean Bean in his first shoot-out does seem to leave you to think that he is somehow not as professional as the rest of the movie would like you to believe he is.  The score effectively sounds cinematic enough to propel the action and at 108 minutes it's about the right length for the amount of story to be told.  It's not a disaster, but as a budget buy this will fill some of your spare time for you well enough.  Certainly for a movie that looks fairly exploitational from the cover, it does a surprising job of showing two sides of an all too current story, in an interesting and even-handed way, tied in to a thriller format.",1353801600,,2021,4.542699724517906

5073447,3,B007BCO592,"This movie was well-written and acted. Only down side was a few slow moments, but then it is a mystery-thriller more than an action movie so no roller coaster ride here. Sean Bean's secret service character doesn't channel Bond or any of the American action heroes so the action is more low-key. Although the fighting sequences are fairly realistic.

One issue I found was with the pistol silencers. One scene we have the the next we don't. The scene with the lads running about the streets of London in broad daylight busting caps without silencers was awkward; especially since they just had silencers a few moments before. They go banging about and no one is the wiser in a city where guns are banned???  Tsk-Tsk!!

It gets a tad side-tracked with the love story bit, but even that has some relevance to the plot. I deducted two stars just because of the lags, some of which is caused by the bouncing back and forth between ""then and now"" --- for crying out loud, there is a time and place for flashbacks and a way to use them effectively, this movie doesn't manage it well. I think it adds to the slowness and confusion. Character development could have been better.

I tend to appreciate the roller-coaster style movies where something is constantly happening. This was somewhat too slow for my taste. It doesn't serve to ""make one think"" much either so I can't even give it credit for trying to be a message movie, which it clearly was trying to be. While I found this worth the $3.99.

Rent it?  YES, if you like the whole anti-terrorist thing, and some blood.  Own it? No, there are better movies to rent or own.

5073450,4,B007BCO592,I enjoyed this film. Enough action so not to be boring but not over the top becoming ridiculous and unbelievable. Simple plot with a couple little twists but the movie moves along. I liked the film a lot and would watch it again.,1352160000,,229,4.348837209302325
5073451,3,B007BCO592,"Not bad, lacks something, moves along well and has plenty of action. Sean Bean has a tendency to take on lackluster movies even though he is a good actor. Guess he has to pay the rent also.",1350864000,,189,4.135135135135135
5073452,1,B007BCO592,Stiff acting and a very poor storyline.  If this is really a true story I would expect courts-martial to follow.,1350777600,2,112,4.6
5073453,4,B007BCO592,"Just completed viewing Cleanskin. Overall I give the movie 4 stars. Sean was fantastic. The guy who played the protagonist was pretty good as well. The lady who played the handler she was. Good to. I was hoping that the guy who was the main protagonist would wake up and see that he was being used by the older Muslim to do the dirty work. I was hoping that the silly girlfriend would help him see the light that what he was doing was senseless, but the writers took the story in a different direction. I wonder if any of these pawns ever wake up just before the press the trigger? I'm pretty sure it has happened. But I guess more money is made at the box office when one is shown to be completely barbaric and not evolving. Perhaps it is time for me to write and direct my own movie. I just hate that when the story is told they don't show the rainbow of possibilities or choices that people actually make.

I wish that Sean Bean could be the new face of Spooks/MI5. I really miss that tv series. Bean would make an excellent operative. I hope someone passes this email to the producers of the now defunct show. BRING BACK SPOOKS!!!!",1349568000,2,1135,4.27906976744186
5073454,2,B007BCO592,"Decent film with laughably bad moments where somebody clear said ""make me an American blockbuster"".  Gratuitous attempts to tap into a sense of national pride are tempered by timid nods to cultural relativism.",1349308800,2,209,5.333333333333333
5073455,5,B007BCO592,"I love Sean Bean but he hasn't had a really good role since Bravo Two Zero. Having said that, I still watch all his films when they come out but I had low expectations that this very familiar story about preventing a terrorist attack on British soil would be much good. Well, I was very pleasantly surprised that this turned out to be a terrific spy/thriller. The biggest reason the film is so good in my view is because of the 'back story' about the terrorist which is so well done and it makes up at least 40% of the film which is not what you typically see in this kind of ""the British Secret Service kicks butt"" kind of film. The scenes showing how Abhin Galeva who plays the bomber, is transformed from brilliant Law Student to committed suicide bomber really help explain what is going on in the world today. As his narrative was played over the final scenes of the movie while Sean Bean is trying to stop the attack, I was riveted. And while at times Sean Bean looks once again like he's sleepwalking thru his part here the ending of this movie with him and his Boss played by Charlotte Rampling is absolutely awesome! This film was a total hit which I did not expect so I give it a big thumbs up. If you were a fan of the British TV Spy drama 'Spooks' (or MI5 as it was called here in America),like I was, you will LOVE this movie!",1348704000,2,1339,4.234375
5073456,3,B007BCO592,"""I'm gonna find everyone of them and send them to the death they prey for."" When the government gets word of suicide bomber ready to strike they send a secret service agent named Ewan (Bean) to stop him and the cell. Doing everything he can to stop the attack Ewan is also stuck wondering who he is really working for. I have to start by saying that while this is 80% the same as every other terrorist hunting movie lately the one thing this has that helps it is that besides the focus on the agent you also see how and why the bomber turned out the way he did. That aspect was interesting, however the movie was so slow moving that I found it very hard to stay interested in. There were a few twists, but again because of the pace of the movie they didn't have the impact they were intended to (to me anyway). This is not a terrible movie but for me it needed to move quicker to keep me wondering what will happen next. Overall, a slow moving movie that had an interesting aspect to the un-original idea. I give it a C.",1343001600,2,1020,4.156565656565657
8513715,4,B007BCO592,"The complicated adventure of a top secret agent pitted against mysterious killers who try to wreck England. The story is well developed and the English spoken is mostly understandable (nonetheless, my wife and I used subtitles just in case the accent became too thick).  Fortunately, no character's superpower was called forth and it all appeared realistic enough to support the build-up of tension. To us, it was very entertaining.",1529971200,,432,5.260869565217392
8513716,1,B007BCO592,bloody awful. cant get that 1 1/2 back of my life wasted  watching this.,1529798400,,72,4.142857142857143
8513717,1,B007BCO592,Very slow and stupid.,1528934400,,21,4.5
8513718,5,B007BCO592,Sean Bean is as usual awesome. Totally believable. Good plot. Felt authentic. Highly recommend if you want to see a movie that is topical & relevant but not from the US.,1528588800,,169,4.483870967741935
8513719,3,B007BCO592,Good looking movie...jumps around a bit....the director needed to go back and watch the Bourne movies to see how two guys fighting to the death is shot intelligently.  He obviously doesn't have the skill.  He shot it with horrible shaky cam moves and very fast edits.  Pissed me off.  If you don't know how to do it right.....get a good stunt coordinator to show you how.,1528502400,,371,4.575757575757576
8513720,3,B007BCO592,"It was okay, but predictable.  The good guys were pretty much incompetent until the end when they saved the day.  Same old, same old.  Best part is, now that it's over, Sean Bean can shave.",1528329600,,189,4.3428571428571425
8513721,4,B007BCO592,Sean Bean gets Auto 3 star ;p.  Good movie overall.  Lots of drama/intrigue and some action.  Get your tinfoil hat on and enjoy!,1528243200,,128,4.478260869565218
8513722,2,B007BCO592,"The actors are great and anything involving action was very impactful and believable so if you can look paste every other part of the movie then you'll be into it but the writing unfortunately fell waaaay short and usually came off as very much not well thought out for any real character development or scene development. I usually have a pretty low bar and really love action movies but for example :spoiler alertish:

Ash's girlfriend talks about having missed her period then it ""came on the other day"" this is right after they had super hot steamy sex and she's walking around naked and free as a bird.... If you're going to write about something so clinical you should do bare minimum research first if you've never had experience with women and their periods. If it came on ""the other day"" she would still probably have it and therefore if we showed her from the waste down.... she'd be all dressed in Carrie White. Besides the obvious fact that this isn't exactly a conversation you'd have casually after having sex and her being late for a couple of weeks.... LOL. just saying. kinda lost me. did there have to be a baby involved? I dunno. Maybe? But if you're gonna do a scene like that try to not to make it feel like it's out of a middle school virgin's journal.",1527984000,,1274,4.515151515151516
8513723,5,B007BCO592,What a good movie.  Different perspectives on a difficult subject.  Unexpected plot twists and and well done.,1527897600,,109,5.352941176470588
8513724,1,B007BCO592,"How did they get Sean to do this movie?

It was clichd and contained too many plots holes. The individual stories might have been ok but together it felt like they were just jumping around. Ash and Kate were the best story line but the others felt so poorly executed.",1527811200,,267,4.34
