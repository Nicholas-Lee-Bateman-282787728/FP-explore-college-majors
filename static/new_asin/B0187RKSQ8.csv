8741688,5,B0187RKSQ8,"This is a hilarious movie about a German administrator verifying a loan given to an island in Greece. This is a great example of how talented comedy writers can find humor in any situation. Who would have thought that the Greek economic crisis could be comedy gold? In the hands of talented writers, who have a deep love for the country, it works! I watched this with my family and we all loved it. The humor is gentle and full of heart. I particularly recommend it to anyone who enjoys seeing the lovely landscapes in Greece, where this movie was filmed.",1460160000,,555,4.5049504950495045
