8623377,1,B00GHPBP5Q,Not What We thought! Movie was out dated and ran a foul with my Big Bro;who is a big fan of the Mad Monk.,1465862400,,105,3.4166666666666665
8623378,3,B00GHPBP5Q,This movie was purchased by myself because two terrific actors John Drew Barrymore and Edmund Purdom was in it. Not a very good version of the Rasputin saga. It could have been better.,1463875200,,184,4.606060606060606
8623379,3,B00GHPBP5Q,"This film was pretty dreadful and forgetable. Some years back,I had read Robert Massey's book,about the Czar Nicholaus and his inner court. I think Rasputin was more spiritual and reserved than how he is portrayed here. Edmund Purdom plays him as a drunken libertine. He was more of a spiritual advisor and perhaps the sole 'love servant' to the depressed Empress Alexandra. John Drew Barrymore is the second fiddle,in this historically inaccurate film. The sets are interesting,however. There are no sex scenes and the advertising is misleading. In this film,Rasputin's death is also questionable. Rasputin did eat the poisoned pastries,yet did not die quickly. The young Russian nobleman and his buddy pounced on Rasputin,seeing that the poison had failed. They rolled Rasputin into a carpet and dumped him into the river. I forget the details myself. It's been some twenty years since reading Massey's book. The film promotes a larger conspiracy against Rasputin. Yet,the truth was more simplistic. Edmund Pudhom passed away in 2009,in Italy. And John Drew Barrymore,after years of addiction problems,sadly passed away in November of 2004. Barrymore was a much better actor than the weak roles he was offered.",1444608000,,1212,5.317708333333333
