7797748,5,1572521872,"Winstar's ""Cartoon Crazys"" DVD collections are a great grab bag of classic cartoons, this first volume mainly features cartoons from Warner Bros. but there are non-WB cartoons on this disc as well, like a colorful Felix The Cat cartoon from Van Beuren Studios. Audio Galaxy has spared no expense in the restoration of these classics, the sound and look just as beautiful as they did when they premiered in theaters, I recommend picking up the whole series, it is a lot of fun.",1411689600,,476,4.746987951807229
7797749,5,1572521872,I like classic  cartoons from 1920'S  to 1980's. I don't think  theres any talent with computer cartoons have the same  body types.,1391472000,,131,4.818181818181818
7797750,3,1572521872,"When I first saw this DVD, I was surprised that the Warner Brothers logo was not on the box. I found it hard to believe that they would let the  ""WinStar"" company release some of their wonderful cartoons. My  first thought was ""bootleg"". However, bootleg or not, there are  some good classics on here.
My favorite is ""Daffy The  Commando"", a funny short made in the 40's during WW2 that pokes fun at  Hitler and Nazi's. Daffy comes in, and, naturally, makes a fool of the  Hitler character in his usual crazy way. You will probably never see this  cartoon on television, because Time Warner is a big company, and doesn't  want to offend with cartoons that might poke fun at past  differences.
Some of the other cartoons on this DVD include ""Falling  Hare"", featuring Bugs and The Gremlin, ""Tale of Two  Kitties"", featuring Tweety, ""Corny Concerto"", featuring  Elmer and Porky. There are also a couple cartoons featuring Felix the Cat,  and Casper too.
Winstar has done a decent job with the restoration, and  even includes video of how they did it. However, some of the classic  openings and endings (with the WB/Merrie Melodies logos and trademark  music) of the cartoons are cut out! That seemed a little strange. Imagine  seeing a generic graphic with the title of the short, followed by a cold  start into the toon. No music, no classic Looney Tunes intro,  nothing.
All in all, if you're a cartoon collector, then this DVD would  probably be a good addition to your library for the hard to find shorts,  and early versions of Bugs, Daffy, Elmer, Sylvester and Tweety.",966729600,11,1572,4.705882352941177
7797751,1,1572521872,"The package boasts ""classic cartoons""; this must refer to age only and not content or quality.  The Warner Bros. cartoons have been stripped of their opening sequences with the credits and the ""Merrie  Melodies"" theme music.  Some of the other cartoons (Felix the Cat,  Gabby, Toonerville Trolly) just aren't in the same league with those  wonderful Warner Bros. Looneytoons.  The picture restoration is fair; the  sound restoration is tinny, and the ""enhancements"" to the sound  effects are distracting.  Save your money and buy something else.",935193600,12,545,5.317647058823529
