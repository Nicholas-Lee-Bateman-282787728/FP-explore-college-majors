8558185,5,B00AW6940E,"If you want to learn some of Ace's licks and songs, this a good place to start. Doug Boduch plays them all to a T. and the backing band sounds great as well. For the people who seem to have a problem with the format of the video/videos like this: get a computer/dvd player with slow motion capabilities and a device to hook your guitar up to your computer. And then, simply play along until you work it up to full speed. If you don't have the drive/patience to do that you won't learn anything from any source. IMO  Also, the tabs are there. You can pause the dvd and write your own tabs, if needed.

I come from the record/cassette days, and a DVD's like this almost seems like cheating. If you only learned a couple of songs off the dvd, it would still be well worth the money. If you learn them all, it is a steal. Recommended.",1400025600,5,830,4.18125
8558186,2,B00AW6940E,"I bought the Alfred Led Zeppelin learning book/DVD package and that was good and useful. This pure DVD package is not very useful because you have no way of viewing the entire tab, printing it, or working on sections at a time. All you see is an instructor playing and the tab scrolling under them. But if you want to have the tab around to practice it without the video you cannot. It was very disappointing that the tab is not available in a static version. Think of it this way, this DVD is like going to a guitar lesson, the instructor not letting you take notes or giving you the sheet music, and then sending you home. The only way you can play the song again is if you go to the lesson and you play the entire song over again (the songs aren't even split in parts). I'll not buy a Hal Leonard DVD again until they come up with a different way to deal with the tabs.",1394409600,2,872,4.135294117647059
