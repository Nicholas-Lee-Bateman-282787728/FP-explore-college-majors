7928474,3,B00004ZET3,"As a newbie to this site and buying DVDs over the Internet, it is not at all apparent that these DVDs will not work in my region of AUSTRALIA. There should be a CLEAR notification that these are region 1 only for the USA. In fact, it ought to be easy to have the software automatically issue a warning to purchasers outside the DVD region that the discs may not operate in other regions!",1021766400,,387,4.243243243243243
7928475,4,B00004ZET3,"I am a huge fan of Bach's 6 cello suite and have played it for years, and I thought Yo-yo Ma's performance was probably the best I've heard/seen since the legendary Pablo Cassal released it in the early 1900s.  I liked the way Yo-yo was put into various places and interacted with things around him.

  Unfortunately, the greateness about the Sixth Suite was destroyed by using J.S. Bach as ""counterpoint.""  If they were going to use Bach, they should have just used a guy who really looks like Bach, not like some guy with just long hair.  It would had been much better if they just ignored the whole Bach thing and go straight to music.
  However, my biggest disappointment comes with the Fifth Suite.  I couldn't believe that they didn't have a translation when the Japanese Kabuko dancer was talking!  Sometimes, he would be talking solo for a few minutes and there wouldn't even be an option for subtitle.  Perhaps, VHS version has that.  My DVD version didn't.  Anyway, I thought the Japanese dance was cool except that I kept thinking that the guy playing a woman wasn't actually a woman.  I felt kind of uncomfortable when he (or she) touched Yo-yo's hand.
  Lastly, although Yo-yo is a GREAT musician, I think he talks like a woman, which is not necessarily bad as long as you are one.  Does anybody else think that way?",1013212800,4,1329,4.587234042553192
