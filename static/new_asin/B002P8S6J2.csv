Great for just about any DVD player (except that in a moving vehicle) this DVD will entertain and engage your child while they learn how to breathe and move and gain the benefits of yoga without realizing they are learning!  The subtle sound effects, the engaging instructor, the simplicity of the DVD will draw in even the most active child.

The DVD is split into 3 different uses - there is a short segment, just the Pizza Party section, where the children make, bake, and eat an imaginary pizza through yoga poses.  There is a short guided relaxation section, that is great for calming and focusing children. Then you can also play the entire DVD (20 minutes) from start to finish, and it includes warm ups, a cute song, poses and breathing, the Pizza Party segment, and the relaxation segment.

If you're looking for a gift for either a teacher in pre-school through 1st grade, or a parent, caregiver, grandparent, anyone who works with 3-7 year olds, this would make a great one!",1261526400,,1082,4.698412698412699

As a Special Education teacher, I have seen the benefits of yoga work for children and adults with and without many different kinds of disabilities.  With Yoga Playground's  DVD, the kids respond so well and can use the fundamentals of yoga to help improve focus and concentration as well as many other life skills  in a fun way!""

If you thought your child could never do yoga, this DVD will change your mind.  Lisa really does know what she is doing and it shows.  I did the video with the kids myself and felt great afterwards.",1253836800,,314,4.362068965517241
8376762,5,B002P8S6J2,"I have never thought about yoga for my children (3 and 4 year old boys) mostly because the area that I live in just doesn't offer it.  I also never thought that they would be able to follow the directions and maybe it was too ""serious"" for them who are all about cartoons and such.  The first time I started this dvd, I stuck around to watch their reactions and to see if they would stay interested.  I soon found that both boys were totally involved and doing their very best to reach each pose that the teacher was modeling.  Lisa keeps it fun and animated from start to finish, with catchy little songs to get them to the poses.  She stops to remind them to breathe and move slowly which keeps them safe from straining.  At the end, Lisa performs a nice relaxation that lends to a perfect bedtime routine.  I say, watch out Goodnight Moon, Yoga Playgrounds Pizza Party is my new go-to wind down.  I believe it's perfect for a morning start also. Calm, body stretched, practiced control and relaxation, had a lot of fun.  Good practice before school, especially for the child who has a tough time sitting still and focusing.",1253664000,,1126,4.453658536585366
