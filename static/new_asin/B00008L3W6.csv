The Family(which is the best choir on the face of this earth!) is on here doing there thing in a big way! They go way back and sing some of the classics and some of the new stuff too. If you buy this DVD you definetly will be glad you did!",1123027200,,416,4.024096385542169

7985338,5,B00008L3W6,this is my favorite one by far,1430265600,,30,3.4285714285714284
7985339,5,B00008L3W6,Excellent product! This product is very inexpensive and I don't have to go all the way to the store to pay for something that cost more.,1363651200,,136,4.269230769230769
7985340,4,B00008L3W6,"I had never seen this dvd prior to 2008, so it was good to hear/see those K. Franklin songs from back in the day.  Kirk really loves him some Michael Jackson because he was doing all of his moves!  Loved seeing CeCe Winans and  Trinity 5 7 as well as seeing Tamara Mann back in the day (she can STILL blow just as good!).
Kirk has been active and creative for a very long time.  Good crowd shots, effective camera and lighting on this DVD.",1218585600,,439,4.129411764705883
7985341,5,B00008L3W6,"Kirk Franklin is a young master. He understands that many of the youth are not going to be reached by the conventional ways of the church. So, he comes to them on a level they understand and are not turned off to. (THE MUSIC AND THE SHOW). After he gets their attention, he spoon feeds them some of the message, then  POW  back into the show. And back and forth and back and forth. And eventually some of them get it. For others it was a great show. Maybe next time. Still, Kirk never relinquishes his spirit. He knows what he must do and how he must do it. Beautiful! Go Kirk and as the little old lady might say  KEEP ON KEEPIN' ON, BABY!",1189555200,,640,4.104
7985342,4,B00008L3W6,"The show is very good, the guest singers are a great addition to it and the stage production is very impressive. However, take into consideration that the sound quality of this DVD is extremely poor.",1168387200,,199,4.714285714285714
7985343,4,B00008L3W6,"Kirk Franklin is a great producer. This DVD is great. This opening of this show is pnenominial. Debbie Allen had a lot to do with the steps, and I loved it. The sound is not as pristene as some of his other work but it is good.",1167782400,,227,3.851063829787234
7985344,5,B00008L3W6,KIRK FRANKLIN DID AN EXCELLENT JOB ON THE DVD. THIS CONCERT WAS OFF THE CHAIN. I LOVED EVEY MINTUE OF IT. KIRK AND THE FAMILY DID EXCELELNT. THE BAND WAS ON FIRE. IT WAS LIKE I NEVER SEEN THEM BEFORE. I THINK THAT THIS IS THEIR BEST PERFORMANCE TO DATE. EVERYBODY NEEDS TO HAVE THIS DVD,1131062400,,286,4.125
7985345,5,B00008L3W6,"I really love the ability of Kirk to turn things around and also direct the choir, etc. He is incredible and all the songs and vigor cannot be measured as he dazzles the crowd with so much control over the music. The guest artists were also great, Trinitee 5.7, Crystal Lewis, Cece Winans, etc. I believe Baltimore shook on that day. Go ahead Kirk, I appreciate your talent and anointing.",1127174400,,388,4.557142857142857
