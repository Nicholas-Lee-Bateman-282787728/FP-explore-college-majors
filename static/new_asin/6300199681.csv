7805021,5,6300199681,"This production is lovable because Ingrid Bergman is loveable. But there is one more reason why it is important for me: I have a theory according to which cancer is caused by complacency, it is punishment for being complacent, it seeks to terminate complacency. Ingrid Bergman became cancerous because she was extremely complacent. Watch the story of Bergman with this in mind.

Each one of Shakespeare's four great tragedies is about one basic problem of humanity. Hamlet is about the difficulty of harmonizing sex with love. Hitchcock's The Birds is a screen version of Hamlet concerning audience reaction, in which the lines and action of the play are faithfully translated into film frames and camera movement. Hitchcock said that the Birds was about complacency. Othello is about racism, and Macbeth about using the concept of God to satisfy selfish needs. Domination is a common feature of all four plays, as well as all films by Hitchcock and others.

PSYCHOSOMATIC CANCER

I have shown in my books that the symptoms of primary mental disorders are automatic responses that are caused by harmful failures and that have self-protective function. In particular, I have shown that migraine is a psychosomatic disorder caused by sustained self-harming behavior. I have cured about 120 migraine patients in very short times by exposing the causal relation between the symptoms and the harmful situations that made them necessary. Oliver Sacks identified a type of migraine which is caused by a particular situation and called it situational migraine. I wrote in my book that every migraine case is situational, but that symptoms become periodical when the harmful situation is continuous or is frequently repeated, thereby obscuring the causal relation between the symptoms and the harmful situations. Sacks wrote to me that he did not believe that all migraine cases were situational; but he admitted in the new editions of his book that situational migraine is a psychosomatic disorder.

The experience of a migraine patient of mine suggested to me a relation between migraine and cancer in his case. He was a rich businessman doing construction work and losing large sums of money because he was extremely optimistic, extremely complacent. He became cancerous. He quit construction business because it was too risky and opened a supermarket. He did not die of cancer and did not suffer much; he just stopped being optimistic and losing money. He also became more sensitive to the misfortunes of others. But, the real issue is not losing money, it is mental weakness suggested by the harms and losses of all kinds by being complacent. This case made me look for complacency in every case of cancer, and I found it in most cases.

It appears that the agents on the long list of carcinogens produce cancerous cells more often than they produce cancer disorder, but that the body eliminates those cells in most cases. Cancer illness is caused either when carcinogens produce too many incompatible cells or when the person's unconscious automatically abstains from eliminating them for terminating complacency, thereby causing psychosomatic cancer. There are also neurological and developmental researches that support the view that most cancer cases are psychosomatic disorders. The physiological abnormalities associated with psychosomatic disorders are themselves caused by psychosomatic processes. Contributions of cancer patients to this line of thought can lead to psychosomatic therapy of cancer. Complacency involves not only extreme optimism related to one's selfish needs but also indifference to the sufferings of others.",1397779200,,3632,5.320557491289199
7805022,4,6300199681,"It seems I shall always have a fascination with the sublime Ingrid Bergman, an actress I've loved ever since I first saw ""Anastasia"" in my teens.  This documentary, with input from Bergman's daughters Pia Lindstrom and Isabella Rossellini, does help her fans to understand the private woman behind the screen; a woman, it seems, who obeyed an inner voice and followed a path which led her through a most interesting, turbulent and celebrated life.

An overnight success in Hollywood after starring in ""Intermezzo"", Ingrid Bergman delighted moviegoers with her fresh, natural beauty and warm persona.  Acclaimed performances in ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", ""The Bells of St. Mary's"", ""Gaslight"" and ""Notorious"", to name just a few, cemented her positon as one of the great leading ladies of Hollywood.  But when she fell into a passionate affair with director Roberto Rossellini, Bergman earned the wrath of her fans, columnists and even politicians!  Abandoning her husband and young daughter Pia for a new life with Rossellini in Italy, Bergman was blackballed from the United States, and her career seemed to be finished.  But in 1956, ""Anastasia"" turned the whole game around.  Suddenly Ingrid Bergman was on the rise once more, and this time, the world was completely at her feet...

Running just under an hour, INGRID BERGMAN REMEMBERED will please Bergman's fans (she seems to garner more and more admirers each year thanks to the reissuing of her marvelous movies on DVD) but those looking for copious footage from her films will be sorely disappointed.  Only a few films are shown at all (""Casablanca"", ""Gaslight"", ""Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde"", ""Anastasia"" and ""A Woman Called Golda""), but we do hear lots of interesting stories from Pia and Isabella, and even Ingrid herself.  One wishes that the documentary ran longer, as Bergman's life was so very eventful, both in private and in her professional career.

A lovely, heartfelt remembrance of a true class act.",1298505600,7,1964,5.087227414330218

7805024,5,6300199681,"There has always been a sad lack of attention given to this great actress compared to other Hollywood legends, but this video gives her life the attention it deserves.

There are interviews with Pia and Ingrid, two of her daughters (though none with Isotta or Robert) and movie clips galore, but the best thing are the smattering of home videos. A clip where she fishes is worth the price alone, because her look is so comical in it and you can't help but be enchanted by her innoncence there.

If you're an Ingrid fanatic, then definitely get this.",1120953600,3,549,4.591836734693878
