8617690,1,B00FPNQI30,"As far as the content of the documentary is concerned, I have nothing to add to what reviewer John Corbett said, so read his review if you want to know about the content. I'm only adding my two-cents' worth to warn other people so that they don't feel as cheated out of their money as I do right now.

This documentary has been re-edited and retitled twice now and released by two different companies. I originally bought the full-length documentary titled Chicago Cubs: Heart and Soul of Chicago, directed by John Scheinfeld, which was released by Questar. It turns out that the film was simply retitled from its original, We Believe: A Relationship That Lasts A Lifetime ,which had been released by Virgil Films & Entertainment. I noticed in the product descriptions that the same director and actors (who were interviewed) were listed, so I was intelligent enough not to fall for this marketing ruse and didn't buy the same film twice. Unfortunately, I was not wise enough to avoid the current marketing ploy of whittling down the documentary, retitling it again, and omitting the names of both the director and actors from the product description; the fact that Questar released this disc also led me to believe that it was a different film, since they had released one of the previous versions. I truly thought this would be a new documentary that would cover Chicago Cubs highlights (don't laugh at that) from their 100 years at Wrigley Field, especially since the title implies that it covers events through the 2013 season. Since it is the same old documentary and has not been updated in any way, this title is outright fraudulent. Of course, I had to open the DVD case and play the disc to find this out, so now I can't get my money back.

If you already have one of the previous incarnations of this film, then save your money. If you don't, then buy one of the previous two versions - they are full-length, whereas this one has been edited down some.

ADDENDUM: I purchased and watched the official MLB DVD titled ""100 Years of Wrigley Field"" and must say that it is the superior of the two documentaries. It is also less expensive than the DVD reviewed here, which is a shock since it's an official MLB product. If you want the best of both, get ""100 Years of Wrigley Field"" and the original ""Chicago Cubs: Heart and Soul of Chicago"" or ""We Believe"" (both of which can be had cheaply).",1388793600,16,2398,4.624413145539906
8617691,2,B00FPNQI30,"Perhaps my expectations were too high.  I knew this documentary wouldn't be on par with a Ken Burns documentary, but I hoped that it would provide a comprehensive look into the origins and development of the park, with vignettes on the timeless moments at Wrigley.  The 1915 Federal League pennant which the Chicago Whales won on the last day (when Wrigley was known as Weeghman Park).  The double no-hitter from 1917.  The 1923 and 1927-28 expansions of the park.  Gabby Hartnett's 1938 ""Homer in the Gloamin.'""  Hank Borowy and the '45 Cubs.  Hank Sauer, Ken Hubbs, Lou Brock.  The '69 and '84 Cubs.  The battle over lights at Wrigley.  Sammy Sosa, Kerry Wood and the summer of '98.

In truth, this documentary is a confusing mish-mash that never finds its stride.  We see occasional short snippets that treat the history of Wrigley Field in broad-brush terms, with no new information for anyone beyond the truly novice fan.  Many of the so-called ""Wrigley"" moments, such as Merkle's ""boner"" or the infamous black cat of 1969, actually took place before Wrigley was built or on the road, and are better described as ""Cub"" stories rather than ""Wrigley"" stories.

Those snippets are interspersed between lengthy segments dealing with Cub fandom in laudatory and general terms.  The documentary's strongest suit is its interviews with famous Cub funs (George Will, Jeff Garlin, Bonnie Hunt, etc.).  Even those interviews are more in the mold of ""how great Wrigley Field is"" or ""Cubs fans are special"" than anything illuminating about the history of the stadium.  I certainly count myself as a die-hard Cubs fan, but this seems to be the wrong emphasis for this documentary.

The documentary seems to randomly shift between topics.  To make matters more confusing, after about an hour, it incorporates a 1989 documentary hosted by Jeff Daniels that revisits many of the same things from earlier in the present documentary (and actually treats them better).

This documentary may be enjoyable for people who know little or nothing about the Cubs or Wrigley Field, or for those who simply want a warm and fuzzy experience, but it is a flop as an historical documentary.",1388534400,8,2165,4.961111111111111
