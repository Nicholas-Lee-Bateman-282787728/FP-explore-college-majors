5049140,5,B00720OO62,What a different story; different viewpoints.  Beautiful actors.  Lovely scenery.  Great filming and wonderful stories.  I will be getting more of this series to be sure.,1355788800,,170,5.423076923076923
5049141,4,B00720OO62,"A very charming beginning for what promises to be a good series, with many ongoing stories blended into the main idea.  I'm looking forward to Series Two!",1354665600,,154,4.703703703703703
5049142,5,B00720OO62,"Surprising little series with wonderful acting and a story line that goes in unexpected directions.  This is not just a ""fish out of water"" story and well worth the purchase.  Just wish the DVD version had subtitles to help with some of the heavier accents.",1351641600,7,257,4.688888888888889
5049143,4,B00720OO62,This is a good movie because of its interesting characters.  Some of what takes place is not for younger kids and I could of passed on it myself..  But the story of the miners and what they faced in the mines and also the story of the Dr. and his wife coming all the way from India to practice medicine make for an interesting story line.,1345507200,2,338,4.106060606060606
5049144,5,B00720OO62,The DVD arrived promptly & was packed securely. I don't have any other remark to make regarding this purchase. Iam done.,1343865600,,120,4.761904761904762
5049145,5,B00720OO62,"If you like British dramas such as Ballykissangel or Monarch of the Glen,hen you will enjoy this program.  It is not Doc Martin but it is a warm show that makes you feel good after watching it. The series takes place in Wales during the early 1960s. The culture clash between the the sophisticated Indian doctor (and his wife) and the villagers with their xenophobic tendencies makes for interesting viewing.  The acting and production values are very good.  I am eagerly awiting the release of season 2.",1338163200,8,504,4.7701149425287355
5049146,4,B00720OO62,"I enjoyed this very much, especially (I have to admit) the beautiful clothes the beautiful doctor's wife wears.  The doctor comes across as a really caring, sensitive man.  His wife's reactions to her new country are funny, and the scenes where she protects the local ""bad"" kid and tries to help him, totally won me over to her corner.  If there is a second season, I will buy it.",1335916800,14,380,4.478260869565218
5049147,5,B00720OO62,"Doctors- we have all seen one at one time or another and so we believe we know how a doctor looks; how a doctor acts. There is something about the new guy in town that puts peoples' backs up-until the new guy has to save the day.  The point of view is that of the observer, seldom of the new guy.  It takes some skill to get the observers-in this case the viewers-into the mind set of the new guy-and the communiity in which s/he is found.  Put a South Asian in South Wales and it is going to take awhile to get it-but get it one does and it is wonderful.  Doc Martin moved to Cornwall and we all got used to it.  The Indian Doctor is as good and the magnificent Welsh scenery is better-and more realistic.  (The sun never once stopped shining in COrnwall in the DOc Martin series-at least there is a cloud or two coming in over the soon to be disused coal mines.) It is period-1963-and engrossing.",1333756800,33,898,4.161849710982659
5049148,5,B00720OO62,"This programme was original shown during the afternoon by the BBC in the UK, but has subsequently be shown several more times during more ""peak"" viewing times, this was due to the great acclaim it received from critics and public alike. If you like British drama I would advise you to give this a try, I'm sure you will not regret it as it blends a good storyline with great acting and high production values. It accurately portrays the Welsh valleys of the time, (early 1960's), with both serious and comedic elements, very highly recommended.",1330560000,39,544,4.7368421052631575

5049151,5,B00720OO62,Very interesting story about Indian doctors brought in by the UK health ministry to help small towns.  Set in a small coal mining town in Wales.

I was curious about this series. I read the reviews from other people and I decided to take a chance. I am so glad that  I did.  My husband and I were drawn into the story immediately.  The characters are multi-faceted-just as real people are. The characters are shown with their good traits and bad traits. The story is interesting and we found ourselves watching episodes back to back.  My only criticism is that the series only had 5 episodes.  We were left wanting more!  I hope that I inspire others to give this series a try. Between the interesting story and the excellent acting, I believe it is worth the time and money the viewer invests in it.

5049218,4,B00720OO62,"The drama series is a fascinating portrayal of immigrant Non Resident Indian (NRI) saga that we have all heard of and have different perceptions of.

The story is set in the sixties in a small Welsh town where the life revolves around the local Coal mine. The Indian doctor, Sanjeev Bhaskar, and his wife migrate to Wales, with the first wave of Indian doctors ""imported"" by NHS.

Dr. Sharma promptly tries to integrate into the village by socializing with the locals at the pub and flirting with the ladies while Ayesha Dharker plays his wife, an uppity Indian character who just doesn't want to settle in a ""village"" The story also portrays the migrant saga, the travails of landing in a foreign land, having to prove oneself. And the delicate balance of trying to blend in while maintaining one's roots.

A charming first series has a mix of everything, some comedy, a bit of drama, a ""villain"" and the many shades of local gray.",1372636800,4,932,4.670731707317073

The first season is about their adjustment to the town and the town's adjustment to them. The characters are well drawn and the acting is first-rate. Better yet, everyone looks and acts like real people one would see anywhere. As such, the viewers  will find that they are immediately drawn into their lives. This is a wonderful series, and I cannot wait to binge watch season two! I love it!",1530144000,,597,4.740384615384615

8508663,5,B00720OO62,I love this series.  It accurately depicts many off the issues of the early 60s.  The acting is superb and the Welsh area with its coal mining community is a gritty delight.,1516406400,,173,4.375
8508664,5,B00720OO62,"I will watch just about anything with Sanjeev Bhaskar in it.  But I was a little afraid of this one because there's such potential for it to be ""Oh, look at the exotic Indians in the hillbilly village"".  But of course Bhaskar wouldn't be in something so vapid and uni-dimensional.

In the first few scenes, you will hate Mrs. Sharma.  She's judgmental, pretentious, and disapproving.  But before the end of the first episode, she transforms into a complex, intelligent, compassionate, lovely character who brings comfort to the residents of her new village even as she struggles to leave them.

It has the charm of Home Fires and Call the Midwife without an overdose of vintage sentimentality.  It's retro without being stuck in the past.

Of course Bhaskar is brilliant.  Again he succeeds in playing a believable Indian character without becoming a caricature.  Dr. Sharma is complex and deep.  He's not just the good guy doctor and husband.  He's a fully-formed person, which is rare in the first season of any TV show.

And it is SO GOOD to hear Welsh spoken on a British TV show.  I hope there is more Welsh spoken in seasons 2 and 3!",1514073600,2,1139,4.686868686868687
8508665,5,B00720OO62,Love this series. The 2 lead actors are wonderful. Wish there were more than 3 series.,1513296000,2,86,4.4375
8508666,4,B00720OO62,"Ayesha Dharker is wonderful, as is the character she plays. Sanjeev Bhaskar is a wet blanket with a limited range of facial emotions. There is little chemistry between the two, who play husband and wife. Dharker's character evolves in ways that Bhaskar's does not.

Season 1 is about the married couple's integration into South Wales; their marriage is less than solid. Season 2, my favorite, has a wonderful storyline about a smallpox epidemic. The couple seem to be at their best although romance is hard to be found. Season 3 is full of unlikable characters, and by the time Bhaskar works himself into anything close to a romantic side, it is too little too late and clumsy and unbelievable.

Still, in many respects, the show is a delight to watch. It has some of the quirkiness of Doc Martin although Sanjeev Bhaskar is no Martin Clunes.",1513036800,,842,4.760273972602739
8508667,5,B00720OO62,Excellent characters; good script. I thoroughly enjoyed the first season.,1512345600,,73,6.4
8508668,3,B00720OO62,"I generally love series set in historical periods and those that deal with intercultural encounters. However, this series fails completely to live up to its rather promising premise. There are three seasons; each features an almost irredeemably awful villain (it's a different villain each season). We know from the start he will be vanquished, yet we are asked to believe there's some actual chance he won't. It's lazy, formulaic writing. There are far too many one-dimensional characters and not nearly enough nuance. The series also comes a bit too close to the edge of dabbling in cultural stereotypes. If you want to check out the eccentricities of south Wales, I suggest you try either Stella or Gavin & Stacey. The Welsh mining communities of the early 1960s -- and the expatriat Indian professionals who came to England in that same period -- deserve better.",1503014400,,866,5.020833333333333
8508669,3,B00720OO62,I was hoping for more. The actors were wonderful; the story was a bit predictable and sappy. I wanted to love it but ended up feeling it was only ok.,1489708800,,149,4.0
