8441803,5,B000QCTGDE,"I have used this video with my elementary students as an indoor workout when the extreme weather conditions force us into the climate controlled building. Christy has a wonderful way of making exercising fun. My upper elementary students were able to catch on to the steps without frustration, unlike other workout dance videos I've used. Christy models the steps in a way that does not overwhelm the first time viewer. If you want to get a good work out, this is a video worth purchasing. Christy also comes to the Texas Association of Health, Physical Education, Recreation, and Dance Convention each year and attracts a huge crowd that is eager to learn her old favorites, as well as the latest dance moves. If you have the opportunity to see her in person, she will inspire you to attempt any style of dance. She has many other wonderful videos that I have also used. I have never been dissatisfied with any of her products.",1063065600,2,928,4.699386503067485
