The music is perfection and I hope they make many more seasons.  But you don't have to buy the dvd, it is being streamed on a couple of sites with excellent English subs for free and you don't download anything.",1422316800,,361,4.424242424242424
8530306,3,B008TZ67OQ,"Watching the character eating a large variety of foods from many different Japanese restaurants was interesting. I liked watching the eating and ordering etiquette. I watched all of the first season and am in the middle of episode 8 from the second season. I think this is my favorite episode. It is in Ryogoku (Sumo Town) The main character grows on you. I like seeing how he enjoys his food but I would like him to not like the food every once in a while.

I like this episode because he gets a dango set, which is one of my favorite Japanese foods. Impossible to get where I am. Dango are pounded sweet rice balls on a stick that are soft and chewy and usually come with something on them like sweetened red beans or this sweet salty brown sauce that I think is soy sauce mixed with mirin and sugar and potato starch...? And one of the skewers had dried seaweed flakes on it which I hadn't seen before. And then later in the episode I saw a guy that I think was in that old movie called Tokyo, the Last Metropolis. The tall bad guy in that movie is I think the barber in this one maybe. Except that I can't believe he is still alive if it is him because he looks like he has that disease that makes someone grow too much. They get huge chins and long fingers. That motivational speaker Timothy Robbins (?) has it. I thought those people usually had shortened life expectancies.

The show wasn't critical enough to get more stars because I don't like it when food shows positively rate bad restaurants. I started to get the idea that you could serve him a can of cat food and deep fried dog turd on a stick and he would get the same amazed and blissful look on his face. Apparently, you can't feed this guy anything that he won't like. But still, it was helpful for a foreigner wanting to eat out in Japan.

Like I didn't know that you can normally ask for a refill of your rice bowl by saying o- kawari. I wouldn't need it but my boyfriend always eats two bowls. It looked like the refill of rice comes free like when you refill your soda or sweet tea or coffee in most restaurants here.

There wasn't much of a plot to the series. It is mainly just the main character ordering food and then eating. I like Japanese food so I was trying to learn what to call the different types of foods because I don't know some of the names for some of it.  Also, I didn't realize that the Japanese restaurants are really accomodating if you want to make a change to your food. The French are definitely NOT! Want cheese on your bacon burger even though it isn't on the menu? Not in France. Forget it. The restaurant has a bacon burger. They have a cheeseburger. But no way in hell are they going to make you a bacon cheeseburger even if you offer to pay extra. Nope. Not on the menu. Not gonna do it. But watching this series, it seems that Japan has a Burger King attitude (within reason) in their food establishments--we do it your way. Cool.

I saw something that was kind of funny in season 2 episode 4. He was eating in a Brazilian restaurant. They gave him a stew with a cheap metal gravy ladle in it. He awkwardly shoved the whole ladle into his mouth like it was a spoon. Ladles are wide so they don't go in well that direction but if you try to get it in your mouth sideways, then the handle is in the way. It was really fun watching him get the entire ladle in his mouth. He turn it at an angle and sort of wiggled it in. Then he kept bizarrely curving his top lip into the deep dip in the ladle to try to get the stew out from it and into his mouth. Um, listen, guy, you are not supposed to eat with the ladle. It is a ladle. Does it look like it is made for eating from? There is a reason that spoons are shallow. I had heard that sometimes Japanese don't know what to do with Western utensils but I didn't know whether to believe it or not. Well, now I have seen it with my own eyes. Can you imagine a guest at Thanksgiving dinner trying to stick the entire gravy ladle in their mouth and then doing lots of awkward maneuvering to get all the gravy out of the ladle and into their mouth? Raise your arm high in the air and try to tip the ladle sideways in your mouth. Um, not such a great solution unless you want food down your airpipe. Ok, then, pull your top lip over your teeth and use it to slide the stew out of the spoon and into your mouth while the spoon is halfway in your mouth--yeah, a little messy and not really what a lip is for but that was the technique he finally settled on. So funny.

I guess turnabout is fair play because the Japanese have a lot of etiquette governing proper use of chopsticks. I don't know all the rules so who knows what weird things I do but some basics are don't stick them in your rice like a gravestone, don't bridge them across your bowl, don't wave them around when you talk. On the other hand, behaviors are approved that would not be in the West such as picking up your plate or bowl and placing it near your mouth then shoveling food into your mouth. In general, the dishes stay on the table in western culture. Whereas in Japan and China they consider that we aren't animals who have to bring our faces down to our food bowl to eat. As humans, the theory is, we bring the food dish up to our face.

Cultural differences are interesting, I will probably never get used to watching someone shovel food in their mouth swallowing as fast as they can shovel while holding their bowl up to their lips or hearing them slurp loudly or suck noodles up into their face with loud slurping sounds. I saw mostly men doing these things in Japan constantly and was always like, ""seriously?"" The guy in this show does it all the time. Almost every meal he ends with shoveling rice into his mouth with the bowl held to his lips. It isn't bad manners there. I doubt I will ever get used to seeing it. I can't watch anything else when someone is doing that. It is mesmerizing. I think like every single Japanese man without exception is a speed eater if they want to be. It is not AT ALL surprising to me that one of the longtime world champion speed eaters is a skinny Japanese guy. I think their legs are hollow. They don't even have to chew. They just shovel the food into their face and then suck the food into their esophagus and let their stomach do the tedious work of chewing it up.

Other good Japanese dramas revolving around food are Shinya Shokudo (late night eaterie) and the one about the detective agency man who loves food--can't remember the name. But those were more traditional dramas. This one truly is about food and has real restaurants with the real food they serve featured.",1357171200,,6633,4.224763406940063
8530307,3,B008TZ67OQ,"Great series, great price, super fast shipping, thanks very much JD.
But this is the first season of Kodoku no Gurume, from 2011 not 2012. I wasn't too surprised because Season 2 is playing on TV Tokyo as I write. I really like the premise of the series and its execution, the music, photography, editing and internal monologue of the main actor, whose facial expressions and solitary enjoyment are so charming. This appears to be the official TV Tokyo-approved release. So it's a bit strange that the subtitles are absolutely appalling. Complete rubbish. Who oversaw them? Does anyone behind this production care about non-Japanese language viewers? The subtitles are often nonsensical, sometimes saying the complete reverse of the script. It's almost like they relied on Google translate -- of a different program. Oddly, the Japanese subtitles (to the Japanese dialogue, mind you!) are just as bad. Just wrong! They sort of look like Chinese paraphrasing by someone who barely understands Japanese. But if you know basic Japanese and like the food, you'll love this series. Can't wait for the episodes i've missed in Season 2 to come out.",1355270400,2,1141,5.074468085106383
