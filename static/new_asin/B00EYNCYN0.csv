8610343,4,B00EYNCYN0,"Most times, I can take or leave champion mugger Charles Ruggles, but even I must admit that he anchors this movie, with some assist from Una Merkel at her most wry and deadpan and from a script that adeptly vacillates between levity and genuine thrills. 1934's Murder in the Private Car adapts the play ""The Rear Car"" by Edward E. Rose, and that's just for the trivia-heads as I - and, chances are, you - have no idea who Edward E. Rose is. Murder in the Private Car runs a whiff over an hour and it's a surprisingly effective comedy thriller that sets itself primarily on a speeding train.

The movie starts with the resolution of a long-unsolved case as investigators reveal to Los Angeles switchboard operator Ruth Raymond (Mary Carlisle) that she, in fact, is the long-lost daughter of a tycoon and sole heiress of a railroad empire. In rapid succession, Ruth Raymond  now Ruth Carson - is whisked away to a 5-star hotel and then onboard a private car what's attached to Train 36 bound from L.A. to New York where her father awaits. But don't let that intercepted Western Union wire fool ya. Its original content never did instruct Ruth to get on that train.

Luckily - or annoyingly - Godfrey D. Scott (Ruggles) crashes her party. Scott refers to himself as a ""deflector of crime,"" meaning that he deflects crime before it happens. Scott has sniffed out something shady. And he ain't wrong, brother! Ruth's private car happens to be tricked out with booby traps and secret panels and a murderous impostor and a threatening note. We know it's a threatening note because a knife is stabbed thru it and the message read: ""8 hours to live."" That Ruth and her friends are also menaced by prowling beasts loosed from a wrecked circus train come as an unexpected bonus for the villain in the shadows.

At times the tone is reminiscent of them Old Dark House movies. Certainly, the script transplants a grip of Old Dark House tropes from spooky mansion to hurtling locomotive. The third act devotes itself to breakneck suspense as - and SPOILER ALERT! for the rest of this paragraph - that silkily menacing, disembodied voice follows thru on its threat and isolates our crew on a runaway car packed with cylinders of nitroglycerin.

Mary Carlisle and Russell Hardie are the embattled lovebirds, but they tend to fade next to Ruggles and Una Merkel's effortless show of professionalism. Merkel co-stars as Carlisle's sardonic best friend, Georgia Latham. I found myself caring more about the droll flirtation cooked up between Merkel and Ruggles, never mind that Ruggles has never carried a rep as a romantic lead. Ruggles in this movie makes for an interesting watch, what with his distracted non-sequiturs and his brand of physical dithering. The jokes and gags aren't really so funny, except that Ruggles' off-kilter line delivery has a diverting way of throwing you off balanced. As for black actor Fred ""Snowflake"" Toones, him what plays the 'fraidy cat porter, you just may have to chalk up his portrayal as a crappy yet then accepted racial stereotype of a bygone era.",1444608000,,3071,4.786792452830189
8610344,4,B00EYNCYN0,"I just watched this film on TCM, and usually looking for train films, I loved it.  It has an unusual script and fine performances, notably by Chgarles Ruggles as the would be detective.  But, really makes this film is the runaway train sequence at the end.",1444435200,,256,4.543478260869565
8610345,5,B00EYNCYN0,"This 'film' is one of the better ""B"" movies of the era ( 1934 ). ""Murder in the Private Car"" has none of the 'big name' Hollywood leading people in it, granted. It does have a great cast with Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel accompanied by a great supporting cast. The plot is great ( maybe a little corny ) and is just fast enough paced to keep it interesting for classic movie buffs such as me. And this was made WAY before my 'time' too. See it, if you can. It is wholesome viewing for the ENTIRE family.",1441497600,,505,4.111111111111111
