2268222,1,B00095VKDW,"I remember reading Shaun Considine's ""The Divine Feud"" when it was first published many years ago and although much of it was speculation, (I.E., Joan Crawfords same sex crush on Davis; Davis' affair with Franchot Tone), The Mutual dislike these two ladies had for each other was quite an open secret. In fact, the two often took shots at one another in interviews given late in their careers. The ""War"" heated up after they had filmed ""Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?"" together, and Mr. Considine's book was peppered with factual reports of their mutual antics during the making of the film and their aborted follow up ""Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte"" in which they were scheduled to co-star again. (Crawford withdrew and was replaced by Olivia DeHavilland). I was hoping that maybe we would see some outtakes from these two films. There is nothing here but a collection of film clips from their films presented in no particular order and often at odds with the dull narration. There is nothing here you have not seen and don't already know about. The narrator hedges the producers' bets by stating periodically that there was a ""rumored"" feud between the two stars. That is all you will hear about the rivalry on this disc! The transfer quality is abysmally poor. It's the worst I've seen in years from films that have already been remastered. Passport should be ashamed of themselves for issuing such a low quality product. Twenty years ago I thought that ""The Divine Feud"" would make a good movie of the week for TV providing it could be properly cast. Now, I'm afraid too much time has gone by. I don't think any studio would bother with it as younger audiences hardly know who these ladies were. Maybe Stephen Sondhiem will turn the book into a Broadway Musical. I nominate Bernadette Peters for Bette and Patti Lupone for the role of Joan. If I could, I would give this DVD 1/4 Stars (for the Box). You can throw the DVD in the trash.",1121472000,46,1936,4.680351906158358
2268223,1,B00095VKDW,"Do NOT waste your money on this ridiculous piece of junk. There is so much misinformation and an obvious Bette slant: Bette was the ""actress"" and had a great career after Baby Jane and Joan ""merely"" a star who ended her career in bad films. Davis ended her career in a film far worse than TROG so I find this rather amusing.

At any rate, this is mostly a poor rehash of facts found elsewhere in Joan Crawford:The Ultimate Movie Star and Bette Davis: A Basically Benevolant Volcano.",1121385600,16,482,4.4772727272727275
2268224,1,B00095VKDW,What a piece of junk.  Such a letdown!  I won't go into the boring details - just take my word for it..... DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1121299200,13,141,4.185185185185185
2268225,1,B00095VKDW,"The all-knowing critique by Nelson Aspen below
 states that Shaun Considine's classic tome -
 Bette and Joan - The Divine Feud  -  ""is surely
 the source"" for the Hollywood Rivals DVD.  If
 the reviewer had checked he would have
 learned that the author did not contribute or
 authorize anything from the book to be used in
 the budget DVD.  Nor did he contribute to the
 more lavish but erratic DVD collection of Miss
 Davis and Miss Crawford recently released by
 Warner Brothers - even though the latter lifted
 the title of his book - ""Bette and Joan"" - for the
 lead in their full page ads, followed by
 ""Hollywood Rivalry, Hollywood Royalty.""

 Nice try, to take advantage of the feud, which
 is covered to a farethee well in the book by
 the writers, directors, publicists, makeup men,
 hairdressers, co-stars and ex-husbands, etc.,
 who were there and who could distinguish
 between what was smoke and what was fire.

 So be safe and happy.  Skip the DVD newsreels
 and the astute comments by ""the film historians""
 who weren't anywhere near the two powerful
 screen divas.  Invest your money and buy the
 crackling, rollicking book instead.",1120780800,12,1149,4.7927461139896375
2268226,1,B00095VKDW,"Shaun Considine's fun book, BETTE & JOAN, details at great length (often too great a length) the ""rivalry"" between these 2 great screen legends.  That work is surely the source for this two hour(!??!) documentary which surely has no new light to shed on a relationship that was very little fire but a whole lot of smoke...that only seems to fill the room more as time passes and the legend grows.

I cannot fathom what could comprise two solid hours of information about this flimsy premise other than an abundance of clips and some soundbites from ""experts."" No wonder it's being offered at such a low price.

I'll reserve judgement until such time as I see or read otherwise, but I plan to steer clear.  If I need to sink my teeth into some tired old gossip, I'll dust the book off the shelves.  Meanwhile, I'll enjoy the great Crawford & Davis DVD collections of their movies...which is how they'd best like to be remembered, anyway.",1120089600,9,936,4.614457831325301

8057615,1,B00095VKDW,"Hollywood Rivals is essentially a series of movie trailers, cobbled together, with a voice-over track that does little more than state the obvious. Each segment clocks in at twenty-five minutes, and tells us nothing more than the average fan of either woman would probably already know.  There's no real discussion of the well-known rivalry between the two women, and no in-depth commentary or footage that might raise this DVD into the worth-the-money category.

If you want to spend a lot of money watching trailers for their movies, go on ahead, it won't disappoint you on that level.  But if you're looking for information or just dish, skip it.  You won't find it here.",1275955200,,674,4.938053097345133
8057616,1,B00095VKDW,"Bias of the men critiquing the private lives of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford is the very thick thread sewn throughout this abomnible pseudo-documentary. They fail to grasp that Ms. Crawford had a vast history of being rivalrous. While Miss Davis did not engage in acts of rivalry. The speakers in this horrible film are so bloated on themselves that their gaze is mis-focused upon ahistorical points, most especially about Miss Davis. Their distinctively different personality types is not addressed. Miss Davis was a down to earth, let's make great films kind of actor who was generous with her time and talents beginning in her very early 20s. Ms. Crawford was not down to earth, focused so narrowly upon her own self and was much more of a taker than a giver. She was indeed quite jealous of Miss Davis' super successful career. The two are not comparable because Davis was thee consumate actor and awarded as such, even with the title of ""First Lady of US Cinema,"" on her 100th birthdate when her US postage stamp came out. She was selected by the American Film Institute, out of all the marvelous women 'Golden Era' actors as the first woman, 3rd actor and 5th person to ever receive the Life Achievement Award. Ms. Crawford spent the latter part of her mediocre acting career wasting it on flim flops in B-horror flicks that later become of camp value alone. Thus, these filmmakers' assertion that there was a mutual rivalry is unfounded. Miss Davis enjoyed playing with Ms. Crawford's bitterness and pretentions of superiority. Davis' was a lighthearted acknowledgement that Ms. Crawford was publically known to have a jealousy complex over Miss Davis' career achievements. Davis used her later life career to champion the key issues of the times such as agism, the US' nazi witch hunt, racism, the right to die, families turning upon their elders like moochers, and wound her career up making a marvelous drama, while she was dying, which became the final feature film of Lillian Gish, Ann Southern, Vincent Price and Bette Davis! Ms. Crawford is examined by the filmmakers as a gay icon who's so beloved for being like them, an underdog. By doing this, the filmmakers errantly diminish the classic value of Davis' quite well recognized 60 career years of extraordinary achievements in choice filmmaking that stands the tests of time. This unbalanced and mis-informed film suffers from very poor research. Throughout, the biases of the icon worshippers are defintely showing.",1217808000,,2484,4.9735576923076925
8057617,1,B00095VKDW,"As others have already stated, this DVD is not worth getting. It was very poorly produced on an apparent very low budget because the sound and pictures all looked sub-standard. But the content was just as inferior because there was more than just a couple inaccuracies. And why did they have to put an older picture of Joan and a younger picture of Bette Davis on the cover? I would have loved to see a picture of Miss Crawford from the 30's because this was when she was at her most photogenic, but Joan was always very beautiful, at any age! If you're interested in watching a quality documentary about Joan, I recommend the A&E biography which is often shown on Bio Classics.",1195776000,4,678,4.520325203252033
8057618,3,B00095VKDW,"A controversial introduction to the lives and careers of Joan Crawford and Bette Davis that unfortunately denigrates Crawford's ability as an actress and makes her career an adjunct to that of Davis.

Joan Crawford was a great film actress. She had that ineluctable `something' that makes her one of the most watchable women ever put on celluloid. Her ability to transmit thoughts and emotions to her audience is compelling even to this day.

Bette Davis was a great actress as well and eventually Joan's equal as cynosure, however, what Joan could do effortlessly Bette had to work at and therein lies the conflict which created this DVD.

By the late 1930's they were two competing equals, although Joan was a star before Bette. That's what started the rivalry that culminated not in Whatever Happened to Baby Jane but rather in Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte with Bette the victor. Then in 1978, after Crawford's death, with the publication of a biography by her adopted daughter, Joan's reputation and career went into eclipse.",1181433600,3,1026,4.988304093567251
8057619,1,B00095VKDW,"This DVD has poor picture and sound quality. The information is not always correct nor does the narrator give any sources for the quotes attributed to Bette and Joan.
The worst part of this DVD is the narrator. He is obviously an amateur and narrates the story as if he is reading from the yellow pages.
He makes idiotic statement like ""Olivia replaced Joan in Hush Hush Sweet Charlotte and that really uped the old lady quotient.""
This is one of the dumbest, but there are plenty more where that came from.
I suggest you save your money and your time and skip this puerile DVD.
This DVD is so stupid you will actually feel your IQ going down as you watch it.",1126396800,24,659,4.365853658536586
8057620,2,B00095VKDW,"This DVD documentary got me excited when I first became aware of its impending release. Priced at under $10 I wasn't turned off by the unfavorable reviews because I figured it's worth the gamble. Well, it wasn't. The first ten minutes told me I had wasted my money. Had I not been such a fan of Crawford I would have probably turned it off before the end. I stuck it out but it's certainly a bitter disappointment.",1125792000,23,414,4.3896103896103895
