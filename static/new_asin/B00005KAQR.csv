1618589,5,B00005KAQR,"There's a reason that this production of SOUTH PACIFIC is the most watched TV movie musical of all time ~ it's brilliant!
If you're one of those purists who thinks that this script doesn't need to be tinkered with, think again!  A lot of the original ideas are outmoded, but the new screenplay adds dimension to the story and characters only hinted at 50 years ago.  The restructuring of the material, opening the show with THERE IS NOTHIN' LIKE A DAME, making Nellie Forbush, brilliantly and vibrantly played by our greatest American actress, Glenn Close, older, and strengthening the mission the DeBecque and Cable take on, are just some of this version's better changes.
There's nothing in the story that says Nellie needs to be in her 20s, and Glenn Close fulfills the promise of movie musical magic she hinted at during her engagement onstage in SUNSET BLVD.  When she stands on the balcony and sings the TWIN SOLILOQUIES, you feel her falling in love with Emile.  This Bloody Mary, small and mean as can be, a woman who would sell her daughter if she can make a profit, is a frighteningly real woman, not the caricature she's been played as in the past.  (In a college production I saw, they had to do BALI HA'I as a comedy song because Bloody Mary couldn't pull off the drama!)
Harry Connick,Jr. is absolutely right as Lt. Cable,and his romantic renderings of CAREFULLY TAUGHT, YOUNGER THAN SPRINGTIME, and (on CD) MY GIRL BACK HOME show that he's the greatest crooner of standards in pop music.
Take a different viewpoint when you watch this SOUTH PACIFIC.  See it, not as a film version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's greatest libretto, but as a genuine presentation of World War II.  When looking at it as a war picture, it takes on a new dimension, and plays as the very real drama Michener portrayed in his novel, and which was what was hoped for on the stage.  Be thankful that those awful filters which ruined the 1959 version are gone, and that Bali Ha'i is seen in Cable's mind, as it was meant to be seen.  Enjoy the lively dance on the beach as Nellie and the girls perform A WONDERFUL GUY, and melt as Emile sings SOME ENCHANTED EVENING.
This SOUTH  PACIFIC is a triumph!  It's a masterful production of a great musical.  Let's hope that upcoming productions (how about Ann Margret as MAME?) will come close to this great show!!!",994636800,39,2346,4.612980769230769
1618590,4,B00005KAQR,"This remake is definitely not the 1956 movie - which is both good and bad.  Good - because dramatically, this production is far superior to the movie version - the actors actually act, and the dramatic energy never lets down.  Realizing the pitfalls of casting herself as a young, naive Nellie Forbush, Glenn Close wisely chooses to play the role as an older, more experienced woman in mid-life.  Does it work?  Absolutely - the romance between Nellie and Emile makes more sense, as Nellie's character actually has some depth.  Bloody Mary comes off kind of creepy - which is totally appropriate to the part.  Emile is a wonderful actor - with an accent which even sounds French (rather than Italian).
The bad - while the more intimate approach to the songs works with Nellies songs - the songs for DeBeque were written for Enzio Pinza, and they require a strong, world class voice to bring them off.  Although the character of DeBeque is very strong, and his voice is pleasant enough, it is too week to carry these songs.  But since the overall approach to this production is to emphasize the drama, this is forgivable.
Overall, a fine production - if you want the score sung well, listen to the original Broadway cast, the movie soundtrack, or the fairly recent studio caste featuring Paige O'Hara and Justino Diaz.",993686400,,1317,4.745614035087719
1618591,1,B00005KAQR,"If I could have given this hideous, zero-talented remake of the old musical, ""South Pacific,"" zero stars, I would do so. It's unbelievable that this remake was even aired on TV. Harry Connick Jr. is terrific and he shines in every scene. But 56-year-old Glenn Close is like a grandmother who overstayed her welcome and when she prances around while singing ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out of My Hair"", you simply have to close your eyes and groan. If possible, the worst performance was the creature who portrayed Bloody Mary. She was like some filfthy work horse they dragged in from the streets. Covered with dust and dirt, her teeth green, she sounded like a shrieking frog. Drab photography, zero production values makes you want to rush out and buy the l956 movie production that looks like ""Gone With the Wind"" compared to this embarassing, wretched remake.",993081600,26,866,4.818791946308725
1618592,1,B00005KAQR,"""South Pacific"" is one of my favorite musicals, but this version stinks like a week-old fish. I know Glenn Close produced this as a starring vehicle for herself, but somebody should have warned her that casting herself as the naive, small-town nurse Nellie Forbush was ludricous. And the whole Lt. Cable subplot gave me the creeps.  Bloody Mary introduces him to her teenage daughter and stands there beaming while the kid strips off her robe 5 seconds later.  Having him sing ""Younger than Springtime"" while they're in bed together just killed the romance for me.
The '50's version with Mitzi Gaynor might not be a masterpiece, but it's a lot better than this piece of trash.",992649600,36,676,4.818965517241379

1618755,5,B00005KAQR,"The best version yet. Best of all, for me,  it used real American sailers from a nearby Navy base in all but the lead singers. It more accurately portrays life and the dress code in the South Pacific during and after WW2 thru 1962 on my last visit. Some have critisized the Harry Connick character as creepy, but he was portrayed age correct for his rank, and Liat was around 22, though dipected as a teenager.  But that scene was not out of context for the time and place. To marry any American serviceman was a girl's dream, so she and her family could come to America. And thousands did. It was common for parents to pimp their daughters on the streets as soon as they became a women.  I sat in a Subic Bay bar and chatted with Rufina, a 27 yr old prostitute that was 7 months pregnant, and asked how she started this life. ( I was 19)  She told me it was all about survival. Her dad started her when she was 13.  They had no welfare, food stamps or EBT cards. People died on the streets!  On one occasion we had to step over one dead bodiy on a sidewalk to get some place!  This was a lot for a 19 yr. old to take in!  In the same port I was checking out of the restaurant when I felt a tug on my pant leg. It was a 7 yr. old boy pimping his mother! When I said ""no"" to be a good salesman, he pointed out that his mother was a virgin!  And on it goes with stories from that era.  Robert Pastorali nailed the Billis charactor! So sorry for his suicide. Glenn Close, though too old for her rank, had to match the Emile character. The original version will put me to sleep! But I watch this one over and over and frequently fast forward to my favorite songs. I love Nothing Like a Dame and Bloody Mary! Those who condemn the portrayal of situations in this movie just don't understand other cultures. I used to be this way, too  At Christmas Island the woman went topless, if they wanted to, but it had nothing to do with morality. It was their culture. No uninvited 'touchy-touchy'!  Sadly, two sailors thought otherwise, and thought the girls were 'for the taking',  and were hacked to death by the villiage men while I was there and present for the issue of thier death certificates.

1618784,1,B00005KAQR,"I had originally ordered this DVD in 2007 and watched it many times. The photography was beautiful and I enjoyed it more than the original movie. In addition to the spectacular widescreen feature, there were nice extras including a song kept out of the film, ""My Girl Back Home"" by Harry Connick, Jr. and a 22 minute documentary about the film. This summer, I gave that DVD to a friend who was also a fan of South Pacific. In June, I reordered it from Sparks DVD Sales, fulfillment by Amazon. I didn't open and watch it until last night. My bad. There were NO extras. Worse than that, it was not widescreen, it was full screen. Just imagine - 25-30% of that beautiful cinematography chopped off. And, because more than 90 days had elapsed, I can't return it. I don't know why Sparks DVD Sales would sell this trashy version - if they sold the original widescreen version with all the extras, they'd sell more and have better feedback.",1414886400,3,934,4.5325443786982245

1618786,1,B00005KAQR,"Why on earth did they do this film.  Did Glen Close pay for it so that she could play the role.  It's the only reason I can think of that she would be cast.  There is ""too old for the role""  and there is ""ridiculously too old for the role"" and she fits into that second category.  This is one of those times when you say ""why redo perfection"".  It's pathetic.",1408579200,3,359,3.9859154929577465

1618789,4,B00005KAQR,"This is an okay production.  To be honest Glenn Close is far too old to play the part of a young waif enlisted in the nurses corps in the South Pacific.  But, she is a highly talented actress, and and puts her heart and soul in the effort.  I'm almost sold on it.

To be blunt, the other thing about this production is that it lacks scope.  Simply put there needed to be more extras and larger panoramic shots to show the vistas of the South Pacific.  And that's what makes the original production a a better film.  Both sets of actors are highly competent.  Both fit their roles after a fashion.  Both productions give us the tale of confronting prejudice and racism, though it must be said that the Disney production hits it a little more head on than the original film.  The original production takes on the same subject, but, literally dances around the subject a bit more than the Disney production.

Further, the Disney production includes the fight scene between the lieutenant and the enlisted men, which was cut from the original film.  The Disney production's intent was to give a more honest production than the original film could have given the social restrictions at the time.

For a Disney film it was highly controversial.  Essentially there's a love making scene in the film, which for either production was a huge gamble.  Did it pay off?  I'm not sure.  The love making scene isn't so much a factor in the success or failure of this film, so much as were the budgetary constraints of not being able to put more men in uniform and on screen.  I think that's the film's only flaw, and no others.

All in all it's a decent production.  If you're looking for a new and refreshing take on an old Broadway standard, then check out this film.

Enjoy.",1404172800,3,1762,4.512658227848101

1618823,1,B00005KAQR,"This is quite literally the worst (or one of the worst if you include the equally dreadful ""Phantom of the Opera"" FILM vernon - not the marvelous Albert Hall version) remake of a major musical in HISTORY!!
The cast are ALL dreadful, can't sing (what the hell were they thinking when they cast Emile with this 'whispering pussy') and can't act their way out of a paper bag. I didn't know whether to laugh or cry whilst watching the first 30 minutes. After that I couldn't stand ANY more. I thought of this 'effort' more as blasphemy against the giants, Rodgers and Hammerstein, who have had their work BUTCHERED by this drivel. If you are going to remake a classic, IMPROVE on it please. DO NOT try and turn it into something modern. South Pacific was conceived and written in a different era. Please respect this and stay true and integral to something near the original. I love Glen Close in her other movies but as Nellie? C'mon. She's too old. She CANNOT sing and she is obviously very ill at ease in this role, as are many of the others it seems. Well, I think I've said all I need to. Avoid this like the plague, unless you want to own some kind of 'cult' movie, as it is surely going to capture a wide audience of those who actually enjoy watching 'the worst' of ..

1618825,4,B00005KAQR,"I've read several of the objections to this version, and while in a sense i agree- I think it worked really well.

I was put off by the huge age differences in the original film. Both Liat and Nellie seemed to be WAY young for their loves. In this one, at least Liat looks to be of legal age, and Nellie is an experienced and sensible woman who gets bowled off her feet by love. Now Nellie's ups and downs- ""Wash that man out of my Hair"" vs. 30 seconds later ""In Love with a Wonderful Guy"" are more typical of younger folk... but I like that she's more of a peer of Emile, rather than a chick half his age. It did work well when she got over her issues and embraced his kids as her step-kids.

The Thanksgiving show was a high point, and done brilliantly well, with all the gender-bending and the burlesque of the original (or more).

This version seemed to have more focus on the war, which was appropriate.

I like it a lot. The singing was maybe not so good, but it felt more coherent to me. Close was especially well-cast here- she really made us feel for Nellie.

This musical was originally staged in 1949, well before any Civil Rights actions, and it did deal with racism in a pretty blunt and unforgiving way. That's one of the things I admire about R&H musicals- they generally do have a very progressive political agenda- once one gets over the catchy songs, anyway!

Recommended if you like ""South Pacific"", or simply musicals with some points behind the catchy songs. Though if the latter, do see the ""South Pacific"" with Mitzy Gaynor, too!",1378166400,2,1552,4.390243902439025

1618858,5,B00005KAQR,"South Pacific with Glenn Close is a great movie!  This movie seems much more natural, much more real than the original movie of 1958.  It's filmed as if it were recording a real event - except, of course when the crew breaks into song & dance!  The music is less operatic than in the original movie or Broadway productions.  This will offend those who are seeking opera quality vocals.  But I like that it makes the story seem more real, more immediate.  I greatly prefer this version of the movie over that of the original movie with Mitzi Gaynor, produced in 1958.  I find the older movie to seem rather artificial in comparison.
  If you are seeking a more operatic version of the music, by the way, I'd recommend the most recent Broadway production from Lincoln Center (the music CD), or perhaps a CD performed by Tiri te Kanawha & others.  There is also a great production on DVD performed at Carnegie Hall with Reba McIntire.  This is performed in the form of a recitative where the actors stand and visibly sing their parts from a script without the benefit of a stage or sets.

Now having seen the Glenn Close Rade S version I must say I like it because it is suited to our times. Glenn Close too old well she is younger than me. Her voice is good. Check out Sunset Blvd. Rade Serbedij...forgive me Rade was terrific. Handsome and a great voice. No an over the top R. Brazzi voice. More believable. Harry Connick seemed perfectly suited as the uncomfortable newbie to the island. A little stiff but was that acting.

1618870,4,B00005KAQR,"I just saw this movie on Ovation TV, and I must say I was impressed--especially with Glenn Close, who plays Mary Martin very well though not with the soprano voice Mary had. Glenn is a very fine actress, however, and she gives a strong performance. I say Mary Martin, because I think Glenn was thinking Mary every second of her performance--right down to her hairstyle. Her vocals are surprisingly well done. The music is glorious, one of R&H's very best musicals. Some very fine singers in that male chorus, from someone who has belted out ""There is nothing like a dame"" in my day.

This is a much better effort than the original Hollywood movie, and gets closer to the central theme of racial intolerance. ""You've got to be carefully taught"" is a remarkable song for its day, before the advent of civil rights in this country. A brave effort by R&H, way ahead of its time.

A little story about Mary Martin: Noel Coward discovered her in the chorus of a movie(it may have been one of those Fred Astaire musicals--can't recall), and cast her in the lead of his new musical, Pacific 1860, in the mid-1940s. The show was a flop, but got Mary the lead role in R&H's new musical, South Pacific, a year or two later. South Pacific, of course, was one of the biggest hit musicals ever, and made Martin a star. She and Coward remained close friends, and did a TV show together in the mid1950s.

  However, I was extremely disapointed that the DVD was not produced in WIDESCREEN. Especially with the great Australian tropical scenery. In the documentary, included in the Special Features, you can clearly see a Panavision Film Camera. So why deprive the Viewers.

1618927,2,B00005KAQR,"Let me begin by saying I absolutely love South Pacific. It was the very first musical I ever saw (my parents took me to the movie when it came out, when I was hardly more than an infant) and I grew up listening to the Broadway sound track.

I'm a big fan of Harry Connick Jr.'s musical work, and I think he's an excellent actor. I've been impressed by Glen Close's work, I think Robery Pastorelli is a pretty decent comic actor, and when I saw the ""Making of South Pacific"" promo on TV, I made a point of setting my VCR to catch the movie. I was ready to really enjoy this show.

And boy, was I let down. First of all, no matter how good she looks, Glen Close does not look like a young nurse. She doesn't even look like a middle aged nurse. In her scenes with Rade Sherbedgia, despite all the soft focus photography (and half of this movie looked like it was shot through a pound of vaseline) she didn't look anything like a young woman swept off her feet by an older man. To tell the truth, she looked like Sherbedgia's mother. When Nellie sings that she's just a simple girl and Emil is a sophisticated man, it borders on the tragicomic.

But what makes or breaks a great musical is the singing. Both the Broadway and the original Hollywood versions of this movie were characterized by great voices. The part of Emile de Becque was played on Broadway by Ezio Pinza, and on the screen sung by Giorgio Tozzi, both strong and expressive baritones with an operatic background. The ingenue leads were the great Mary Martin and Mitzi Gaynor. Even the smaller parts were played by dynamic performers like Broadway's Juanita Hall, whose ""Bali Hai"" sends chills down your back.

But these TV version is completely lacking in anything approaching a dynamic vocal performance. Connick, an excellent singer in his own genre, does a workmanlike job with ""Younger Than Springtime"" and then delivers a half-spoken, half sung and essentially emotionless version of ""You've Got To Be Taught"". Sherbedgia, who has some of the strongest songs in the show, can barely produce a whisper. When Pinza sang ""This Once Was Mine"" it brought tears to your eyes; when Sherbedgia sings it, it's incidental music. It's almost as if the entire cast were picked so as not to show up the limited vocal abilities of the star.

All in all a tremendous disappointment. Even if you liked the TV version- especially if you liked it- you owe it to yourself to buy the Broadway album and hear this music as it was meant to be heard.",1133827200,38,2495,4.511061946902655

Besides, the original film version also contained some unfortunate casting. John Kerr was very badly miscast as a World War II Marine officer and Rossano Brazzi was too wooden (as usual). All the acting in the remake is far more realistic. So just set back and enjoy this fresh version of a classic and judge it on its own merits.

1618931,4,B00005KAQR,"What I liked best about South Pacific was the gorgeous scenery and the talented voices.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes musicals and doesn't mind a slightly corny, slow-paced story.  It's well done for a remake (though the modern look of the film took some getting used to, since it is supposed to be set during WWII).

The acting was nothing outstanding, but at least was solid.  I disagree with those who thought Glenn Close did a poor job playing Nellie Forbush.  On the contrary, I thought she had the right personality to portray the optimistic but conflicted heroine.  She really put her heart into the songs, especially ""I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy.""  Yes, she's older than the Nellie in the original South Pacific, but if you haven't seen the original (which I haven't) it doesn't matter.

Rade Sherbedgia was a good fit as plantation owner Emile du Becque.  His gentle demeanor provided a soothing counterpart to Nellie's impulsiveness, and he gave a moving performance in ""This Nearly was Mine."" I would have liked to see more chemistry between the two leads, but they each did well in their individual roles.

The lyrics and tunes are memorable enough to stick in your head for days.  I bought the soundtrack from the 1958 original, and can honestly say I like the songs from the 2001 version better.  The vocal styles and the instrumentation are less exaggerated than in the original, allowing the voices to be heard more clearly.

Even if you're not big on musicals, you should at least enjoy the scenery.  The movie abounds in luscious shots of white beaches and jungle-draped hills. (I'm biased because it was filmed near my hometown in Queensland, Australia.)

In summary, this is an enjoyable remake that stands on its own.  My 91-year old grandparents agreed, and they've seen a lot more musicals than I have!",1106352000,4,1842,4.781645569620253
1618932,1,B00005KAQR,"I haven't even seen this movie, but I want to object to it strenuously!  As any dirty old man knows perfectly well, the whole point of Emile's and Nellie's relationship was the almost-over-the-hill wealthy man hooking up with a fresh-faced,  hopefully reasonably innocent (ideally virgin), preferably gorgeous, sweet young thing. (""This is what I need, this is what I long for, someone young and smiling, climbing up my **** (South Pacific is full of double entrendres, just in case anybody didn't notice)).  Mature or even semi-mature ladies need not apply!  Glen Close is not anywhere close to this ideal!  In present times, this idea is not looked on favorably.  Young girls want to find a life partner of their own age, so they can have romantic love forever (rarely does it actually happen!).  But not that long ago, when women frequently died in childbirth, wealthy men routinely obtained new, young wives, young women who were still interested in the same thing that the man was still interested in, and who would hopefully combine pleasure with production of children.  Mitzi Gaynor may have not been a teenager, but she definitely was perky.  Having Glen Close as the love interest smacks of modern, femininist political correctness.  Incidentally, I agree with a previous reviewer that the dialog in the original South Pacific is rather wooden.  A lot of the lines sound like they're being delivered by non-actors.  But, of course, it is still a wonderful movie.  Would it be possible to have a new version which improved upon the original?  Probably not, because (in my opinion) political correctness and marketing considerations would severely interfere with the story.  The all-important youth market would not want to see a young girl get friendly with a (yuck!) old guy.  Witness the Audrey Hepburn Story, which had William Holden and Gregory Peck changed from middle-aged men into young men.",1101081600,6,1907,5.064102564102564
1618943,4,B00005KAQR,"Though the stage show was one of Rodgers and Hammerstein's biggest hits, the script has not aged well. It is overlong and lacking in subtleness. The 1958 film, despite the beautiful scenery, is played woodenly. Even Rodgers and Hammerstein expressed disappointment with the finished film.
So, in 2000, ABC TV and Glen Close produced a new TB film with a new script that weaves in most of the songs and situations of the original play while at the same time fleshing out the characters and making them more realistic.
Is the film a complete success? Well, no. For starters Glen Close is too old for the role of Nellie. She does act it well, however, and she sings with a characterful chest voice though I do detect some of her high notes might be dubbed. I have just re-watched the movie and don't find her all that objectionable. She sounds like she is having fun cutting loose in ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"" and ""A Wonderful guy."" Remember too that Mary Marin and Mitzi Gaynor were both too old for the role originally. What Glen Close does play very effectively is Nellie's warring emotions. Aided by the camera work, we see her confusion and unhappiness when confronted with her own prejudices.
Rade Sherbedgia certainly looks the part of DeBecque but since we are so used to hearing robust Bass singers in the role, his softly sung arias take a good deal of getting used to. Instead of an outpouring of emotion in ""this Nearly Was Mine"" he offers a more introspective take on the role. It's actually a good idea and might work better with a stronger singer. His acting is quite good but the script does tend to shortchange Emile in favour of Nellie.
Harry Connick Jr acts the part of Cable quite well and shades the characters different emotions. True he is more of New Orleans than Philadelphia, and like the others he tends to pull the big musical moments inward.  It is most effective in the scene after he first makes love to Liat and croons a tender ""Younger Than Springtime.""  This is everything that the sung ought to be... passionate, sexy and filled with wonder. This is a young man caught off guard by true love for the first time and Connick communicates that brilliantly.  His ""crooning"" is not wildly out-of-place and certainly in keeping with the types of singers he would have heard at home. Some scenes later he performs a remarkably understated ""Carefully Taught"" having played the intense anger in the dialogue scene that precedes the song. The result is more a case of Cable realizing what he is saying than just spitting out an angry indictment. It may not be the way it was originally done, but you can't argue with its effectiveness.
Lori Tan Chin as Bloody Mary is much closer to the description provided by James Michener in his original novel than Juanita Hall.  Hall indeed made the part her own, but that is not to say that hers was definitive.

In re-writing the screenplay, the scenes and songs were re-arranged from their traditional order. In this new version we see the first meeting of Nellie and Emile at an officers club dance, and the song ""A Cockeyed Optimist"" is used in this sequence to establish Nellie's outlook.  It's part of her charm and clearly attracts DeBecque.  The structure also allows the first two scenes of the musical to unfold simultaneously.
Anyone considering a Broadway revival of SOUTH PACIFIC might do well to examine the TV film for its style and construction. There might indeed be a way to make the story work for modern audiences, clearing away some of the hoary old jokes and developing character instead.",1076198400,60,3591,4.681458003169572

 My favorite part of this movie is listening to Rade Serbedzija sing. He has a beautiful, dreamy voice.

I believe that he was born in the former Yugoslavia, and in this movie he sings in English and in French! I am glad that he did not put on a phony French accent to play this Frenchman.

He's like 65 yrs old and covered in a big bushy beard! Give me a break! This movie was so awful it was insulting!!",1045094400,7,740,4.613636363636363

This love story, filled with singing and dancing and light-hearted comedy is sure to warm your heart in a feel-good sort of way.  The duo themes of love and loyalty to one's country are tested in this movie which depicts life in the South Pacific during WWII.  Citing Rade Sherbedgia who starts a French Planter in love with a navy nurse (Glenn Close)--""When a man faces death, he must weigh his values very carefully; he must weigh the sweetness of his life against the thing he's asked to die for.""",1040947200,,586,4.7254901960784315
1618948,4,B00005KAQR,"I don't agree with the perceived need in other reviewers that a new production of South Pacific must somehow mirror the qualities of the old ones, otherwise it can't be good theater or be emotionally satisfying. Hogwash! A great work, South Pacific endures like the works of Shakespeare because it encourages new interpretations that reveal new riches in the work. True, Glenn Close is not young and perky like Mitzi Gaynor was, nor is the camera willing to hide the wear of life and age, as the stage did for Mary Martin, but that makes Ms. Close's conflicts, her highs and lows, all the more poignant. Chronological age doesn't translate into wisdom. A woman doesn't have to be young to be immature and prejudiced. Nellie's experience can be just as true for a 50-something as a 20-something, especially when it comes to falling in love. I found Glenn Close's performance to be musically capable and poignantly realistic.
Overall, I felt a grittiness to the production that rang true of a bloody war and wasn't necessarily present in the '58 movie version. Bloody Mary is unattractive and conniving. Harry Connick, Jr. is a warrior who wants to be a hero, who's willing to die for it, until he learns too late that maybe love, regardless of its color, is more important. That knowledge is what drives Emile DeBecque.
Rade Sherbedgia makes a great Emile. The man is sexy just walking across a room. Who cares if he's not a booming baritone? The spiritual yearning and joy of ""Some Enchanted Evening"" SHOULD be whispered in a lover's ear. He wants to woo the woman, not blast her out of the water. The quality and tone of Sherbedgia's tenor voice convey a sultry passion and joy of love that rings true and doesn't compromise the song. I found his renditions pleasant, and I think the composers would have approved.
It's a good version. I've got recordings of the original stage production and the movie, and frankly, I prefer this one.",1017705600,14,1936,4.747774480712166
1618949,5,B00005KAQR,"Truthfully, I was skeptical about the remaking of a movie based on James Michener's Pulitzer Prize-winning book Tales of the South Pacific. I mean, how could you top the 1958 version, which in my mind is one of the greatest love stories of all time.

Well, that was until Rade Sherbedgia filled the role of the French Plantation owner, Emile. Glenn Close was a delight as Nellie. Here she almost adds a mature innocence to the story. She is filled with a intoxicating love for life, yet experiences the sadness of almost losing her chance at finding paradise because of her own inner demons.

Harry Connick Jr. adds a much more lusty flavor to this version as the Navy officer who is entranced by a beautiful Tonkinese girl and the tropical beauty of Bali Ha'i.

In general, there are a few scenes I felt were a bit overplayed and they should have included scenes that were much more exotic, like swimming by a waterfall or kissing while rolling on a beach in the surf.

There is rarely a story that can so capture the imagination. It is a story of love and loss in which four souls don't know why they feel the way they do, they just know that they do feel themselves being drawn into the path of destiny.

If you are looking for gripping suspense, drama, timeless songs, romance, seductive tropical islands, interracial romance and intense emotions all woven into a story about a naval base during the second world war, here it is!

Terribly Romantic and an final scene that will make you cry. Not that it is sad, but because love can be so beautiful when two souls finally find what they have looked for all their life.

If you love to run barefoot on a beach in the middle of a storm,
this is your movie!

Note: If you love the song: Bali Ha'i, I highly recommend Enchantment by Charlotte Church! Her voice captures everything the song was ever meant to be.

1618950,4,B00005KAQR,"First of all i am a great fan of Glenn Close, so i am slightly biaised, but i'll try and be a bit more impartial than some of you that have posted reviews.
This Age thing is a big problem in Hollywood with regard to Female Actors. There aren't enough roles full stop and its even worse for actresses over 40. Look at the talent in America, let alone worldwide - Close, Streep, Lange, Sarandon, Hunter. Those five are a powerhouse and its a crime that there are not enough good roles. Basically, most film are no longer 'dialogue driven' and thats the basis of most female relationships.
The problem also ly's with the audience. Those films that are made, that have strong female roles, don't seem to get an audience. 'What do women want??' is a good question.
A film was made last year THINGS YOU CAN TELL JUST BY LOOKING AT HER, great cast (Close, Hunter, Diaz...) and good script, but MGM, decided to show it only on Showtime, despite it getting some nice reviews and awards at Cannes.
Anyway, off the soap box now. I enjoyed this version of South Pacific. As stated in the extras, this was always a dream of Glenns to play this role and the revision sees Nellie as a state of mind. Who says that a women in middle age, cant fall in love and act like a fool??!!Anyways how great does she (Close) look for 52!! Glenn goes for it and you have to admire her integrity and bravery - she must have known the AGE thing would be laboured.
All in All its a good production, Connick Jr is a bit wooden, but sings well.",1003363200,5,1511,4.3052631578947365
1618951,5,B00005KAQR,"I have the original South Pacific sound track on record, and a VHS of the original movie version and didn't really know what to expect from this release with Glenn Close, Harry Connick, Jr and Rade Sherbedgia. What a wonderful surprise!! Rade Sherbedgia as the French planter is suburb, Glenn Close plays a perkey spirited nurse, and Harry Connick is also quite good. The scenery is good, the music adaptation is wonderful and I really can't recommend it enough!  The sound track is very well done and a joy to listen to.",1002067200,7,521,4.663043478260869
1618952,3,B00005KAQR,"The good news first. This isn't terrible. The bad news? It's not all that good either. What it is, I guess, is a musical for people (namely younger viewers) who've grown up on action TV and movies and don't really understand Broadway musicals. The radically different approach may not bother some, but to me, this version of the classic R & H musical comes off mainly as an action drama where the songs are treated as an after-thought. They're there and mostly acceptably done (except for the whispered rather than operatic basso profundo performances of the French planter). The shuffling of the songs isn't that bothersome but that change of focus is. Glenn Close isn't the brassy young filly of the original, and that's OK. She finds a new way to do it. And she's a muscial comedy pro, with B'way credentials. The rest of the performers (who aren't) are just OK and their roles are acted than sung. At least this version doesn't indulge in the weird color effects Joshua Logan attempted in the theatrical film.",1002067200,10,1013,4.728813559322034
1618973,2,B00005KAQR,"Things I liked:
Harry's singing,
and actually, Glenn's singing. She really got into ""I'm gonna wash that
man..."" (although she wore a get-up that I can picture my mom wearing in a
hot-tub. Glenn does not fit the shorts.)
Glenn grew on me, and so did Luther Billis.
They expanded on some themes a little. Lt. Cable and Bloody Mary sort of
struck up a nice friendship.
Even though Glenn is way old, you can tell she has a lot of fun with the
good songs, and actually sounds pretty good.
Things I disliked:
Emile de Beque. Oh it was just awful. He sounds like a weasel singing ""Some
Enchanted Evening"".
Bloody Mary is painful to look at when she sings ""Bali Hai"", and they have
her sing it in a thick phony accent. ughhh
Instead of that ""darn malaria"" putting Joe in the infirmary, they have him
get drunk and get in a fight.
I never got a sense of romance between Nellie and Emile. It isn't her fault,
but his. He was just waaaay wrong for this part. Puts no heart into it. This
movie has none of the cuteness of the original.
BIG disappointment - they cut ""Happy Talk""!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! All that Lt.
Cable wants and gets from Liot is boom-boom. Everytime he shows up, she
disrobes before he can even say bonsai uh er bonswa uh er hello.
Things I am indifferent about:
The added drama. This movie isn't fun. Wait 'til you see the attempted
rescue off of Marie Louise, and this dumb scene with the heads.
Glenn Close is not cute. She sports Khaki pants in every scene but 2.
However, as I stated before, her part grew on me.
In summary, this movie can not and should not be compared with the original.
It is in a class of its own. Definitely approach it that way when you watch
it, or you will just be disappointed.",1002067200,9,1710,4.313664596273292

First of all, the moral of the story was much more fleshed out and better illustrated. Secondly, the cast was spectacular. Harry Connick, Jr.-Perfect. ""You've Got to Be Carefully Taught"" was movingly delivered with anger and resolve. Glenn Close too old? Who cares? She sings, she dances, she ACTS, she washes that man right out of her hair. Forget Mitzi Gaynor. The spirit of Mary Martin was on the screen. I may buy this video for myself, and an exrra one or two for gifts. Good job!",1000512000,5,645,4.6173913043478265
1618975,1,B00005KAQR,"The 1958 film version of SOUTH PACIFIC, although musically about as perfect in performance as this score is ever likely to be, is far from being a cinematic masterpiece like the film versions of THE KING AND I and THE SOUND OF MUSIC but the picture was enormously popular in its time and as this recent ""beyond terrible"" TV remake proves, SOUTH PACIFIC can be done immensely worse. As for the score, all you have to do is listen to the TV remake (if your ears can stand it) to appreciate what can happen when unbelievably lousy singers and inept musical hacks are allowed near this normally wonderful music. And whose brilliant idea was it to add further insult to the injury by hiring a tenth rate composer to write a new incidental background score instead of adapting Richard Rodgers original melodies? I guess the producers didn't think Rodgers' music was good enough, which explains why most of the songs are either truncated or missing from this version. In fact, the song score is musically distorted almost beyond recognition. Glenn Close would have made a marvelous Nellie in 1968, and tries to sing the role with conviction; but her voice has seen better days and now she is much too old to play this part convincingly. Rade Sherbedgia can barely carry a tune in a role that was written for a world-class bass baritone and he acts the role as if he is on Valium most of the time. Worst of all is Harry Connick, Jr., who uses a phony Cajun accent for the Philadelphia bred Lt. Cable, which is the least of his problems, since he can neither act nor sing. The biggest problem with the 1958 film was that Joshua Logan, director of the original stage version, didn't seem to have enough confidence in the play and the music to allow himself to transfer it to the screen without distractions like the color filters in the songs and the freeform but unorganized choreography that mars what could have been a sensational picture. Nevertheless, the 1958 film is still a zillion times better than this unfortunate and ill-advised Glenn Close TV remake, which is so bad that if someone had deliberately set out to defile and ridicule the memory of Rodgers and Hammerstein and their work, they couldn't have done a better character assassination than allowing this TV movie to be made.",1000166400,19,2284,4.669975186104218
1618976,1,B00005KAQR,"I looked forward to this tv movie and hoped it would be an improvement on the original. It wasn't. It made me appreciate the original. Glenn Close is just too old for that part. She is supposed to be a naive young girl falling for an older French man.  While she sings fine, she is just too old. I think they tried to pretend like age wasn't an issue but it was. Mitzi Gaynor did a better job and was the right age. I think the racial issue in the movie of marrying a man with Polynesian children is not such an issue in 2001.  Also to Lt. Cable being with a Polynesian woman.  Harry Connick Jr. didn't really change the way the original did his part except for I think wanting to marry the Polynesian girl.  How in the world could he fall in love with a girl that he just met? It was just a roll in the hay.  Also, I saw him on some show like Rosie and he had never seen the original. I found that very hard to believe being a music person. How could you not see the great musicals of all time?
The French man cannot nearly sing as well as the original though I think in the original movie he was dubbed.
Why in the world did they have to sensationalize Lt. Cable's death by having him being blown away by a land mine. In the original he dies with dignity quietly. Maybe it's just because kids want to see action these days.
Billis is not as funny as Ray Walston's portrayal. He doesn't seem the least bit as embarrassed or have any strong portrayal or insight of his character that I can see.
I know the orignal is no masterpiece and the colored filters kind of take away from things, but it does have it's good points. Mitzi Gaynor seems so flustered and bothered when she learns that Emile has mixed children which then she would have been. I think it's not such an issue in this because like I said this is 2001 although the story is set during WWII.  The movie needed a younger leading lady, a better singing French man, and they should have kept You've Got to Be Taught because that is one of the most important themes of the story that people are taught racism;they aren't born with it.
I wish that they would remake Mame( the Lucille Ball fiasco). Heard they might.  Now that one needs to be remade. I think I read that they were thinking about Cher which I don't see how in the world that would work.  Too bad they didn't make it with Angela Lansbury when they could have back then. I love Lucy but she was horrible. I know this doesn't have anything to to do with SP but just needed to get it off my chest.",999993600,11,2517,4.15400410677618
1618977,5,B00005KAQR,"This new SP telefilm received harsh criticism
from my fellow American musical theatre fans on
theatre message boards and newsgroups-but I do
not share their negative opinion. This new SP telefilm
combines realism and emotional depth with the magical
romance and fun of the original stage musical. Glenn Close
and Rade Serbedzija give superb acting performances.
Much has been written about GC`s being too old to play
Nellie, but IMHO Ms. Close nailed it when she stated that
""Nellie is a state of mind."" GC`s lovely performance per-fectly
captures the essence of Nellie`s warmth and optimism. MS Close
and Rade Serbedzija have wonderful romantic chemistry and their
scenes together are a joy to watch.
IMHO,the best thing about this new SP is Rade Serbedzija`s
Emile. RS proves that it is heart and soul and not a powerful,
rich,operatic voice that is most important in playing Emile.
Mr. Serbedzija`s renditions of ""Some Enchanted Evening"" and
""This Nearly Was Mine"", sung with true , heartfelt emotion
are beautiful. The Dites-Moi number with Emile and his children
is so sweet-I loved the wonderful rapport that RS shares with
the child actors. Mr. Serbedzija combined quiet strength and
sincerity with a true, gentle sweetness and human vulnerability
into a very moving performance. Thank You Ms. Close for casting
Rade Serbedzija as Emile-his performance touched my heart in a very special way.
Concerning the other cast members-Harry Connick shines in his
quietly effective rendition of ""You Have To Be Carefully taught"".
Robert Pastorelli is funny and endearing as Luther Billis. Lori
Tan Chinn was funny as Bloody Mary.
The location scenery was beautiful and the cinetography was
excellent.
I know that most people do not share my high opinion of this
new SP, and that is fine-I respect each persons right to have their own opinion. I loved this new SP and look forward to watching it on DVD for many years to come. Thank You Glenn Close
and ABC for a job well done.

1618979,1,B00005KAQR,"I so wanted to love this television production. I have been a huge fan of Rodgers and Hammerstein since I can remember, and even worked for the R$H Organization in the early 90s. I think SOUTH PACIFIC as written by Oscar Hammerstein, Richard Rodgers and Joshua Logan is in the top ten materpieces ever written for the Musical Theatre. It is not only one of the most romatic shows ever written, but one of the most dareing of it's time, dealing with racial prejudice right after the second war. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama in 1950.
The original script is brilliantly crafted, experimenting with (as Rodgers and Hammerstein always did) Musical Theatre Structure. The opening scene is a perfect example. In the first 15 minutes of the show we hear ""Dites Moi"", 'Cockeyed Optomist"", ""Twin Silioques"" and, of course, ""Some Enchanted Evening"", almost directly sequed from one to the other. We are taken in immediately on this romatic journey. This is what is missing in this television disaster.
The songs and book, which R&H so materfully crafted, have been surgically removed from each other. The book which won the pulitzer prize has been broken at the bindings with songs shoved in like a 1940s MGM Musical. The romantic lyric ""Some Enchanted Evening, You May See A Stranger, You May See A Stranger Across A Crowded Room, And Somehow You Know, You Know Even Then, That Some where You'll See Her Again and Again"" is refering to an Officer's Club Dance where Nellie and Emile meet. The song says it all, yet in this version we see the Officer's Club Dance..and it is war=torn, dark and dingy. How wonderful to have left it to our imagination! Why do you think the song was such a hit!
I did like Harry C, but again the dismantled book got in my way. If you want to see SOUTH PACIFIC, rent the 1958 movie (which R&H produced themselves so Hollywood couldn't ""tinker"" with their materpiece) or attend a local theatre production. I would prefer an amatur Mary Martin ""want to be"" with the glorious script to this production that ignores any resembelnce of the Pulizer Prize winning original.
This is not SOUTH PACIFIC as it deserves to be produced. I am saddened by the fact the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization gave their blessings. Where's the integrety that forced R&H to produce their own films??? Shame on you!",999216000,16,2320,4.730864197530864
