1430473,4,B00005J9OP,"In the tradition of Evil Toons, here is Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers. If you are someone that is into Hollywood high budge movies and is not familiar with the B movie style, proceed with caution.  For a B movie, the acting is fairly good in this flick. Poor acting in this movie is far less distracting than in other movies of this nature.  Also in the tradition of the B movie style the effects are very low tech and often times way over done, but to the right group of people it is entertainment at its best.  So what if twice the amount of blood is spilled during the murder than exists in the entire human body.  It's entertainment....remember?
The plot of this movie is way out there, but in a good way.  We have hookers in Hollywood murdering people with chainsaws in order to make the chainsaw gods happy.  These people also need the fresh blood to keep their leader among the living.  The idea of a chainsaw cult is truely unique and pure cheese.  A real Fred Olen Ray classic.
If you like Fred Olen Ray's style, grab this movie.  If you are affraid of B movies, be very afraid of this movie.  It is entertaining from begining to end which is more than we can say about many Hollywood hits.  So grab the kids (just kidding due to all the nudity) and enjoy this classic B movie hit.",1014854400,7,1287,4.320833333333334
1430474,5,B00005J9OP,"From the time when Thomas Edison made his first moving picture, to when George Lucas released his latest installment of the Star Wars series, there has never been such a masterpiece anything near HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS. The award-winning performances of the humungously talented cast, combined with state-of-the-art, dazzeling special effects wizardry, made this film the greatest cinematic accomplishment ever! Gunnar Hansen stetches all his acting muscles and puts forth a heartfelt performance that would leave Orson Wells in a jealous rage. The demure acting skills of both Michelle Bauer and Linnea Quigley were so strong and beliveable that I was nearly moved to tears. How could a supurb piece of showmanship like this go unnoticed for so long? Its a crime that this movie never won an oscar. Im still waiting for the big-budget sequel. Maybe they'll spend a cool $70,000, rather then a simple $58,000 and bring this original, beliveable idea to the big screen again in the way it was meant to be.

Relying on what essentially was a repertory company of '80s scream queens--Michelle Bauer, Linnea Quigley, et al--and familiar masculine faces like Jay Richardson, Ray gives us the ultimate in guilty pleasures. Silly, stupid, occasionally sexy (lots of nudity, although I'd have liked more full frontal), and essentially ridiculous, this is a can't-miss for B movie aficionados.

What makes it even better are the extras--a featurette, director's commentary and a few other freebies. Great pickup.",1430611200,4,654,5.288461538461538

The reverse is the same cover where the back has the special features listed in the red area where the autograph from Fred Olen Ray is on the opposite side.  Still a great buy for me and special features were great too. Some were carried over from the first dvd version such as the night owl theater segment.  Highly recommended if still available.

Eventually Jack finds Samantha dancing at a club that is the blast off point for a cult of Chainsaw worshipping Hookers. Prominent among their ranks is Mercedes played by Michelle Bauer ( but credited on my 1988 Unrated VHS copy as Michelle McClelland)who seduces selected victims & then brings them home for some chainsaw practice. Gunnar Hansen is the leader of the cult & as is custom(in a lot of Fred Olen Ray pictures) Dawn Wildsmith has a small role at the film's beginning.

1430600,4,B00005J9OP,"The title alone is enough to make connoisseurs of B-movie horror reel in delirium, but HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS is more than just a film with a deliciously oddball appellation--it also delivers the grindhouse goods!  Copious amounts of stage blood, T&A, tongue-in-cheek dialogue, and chainsaws (of course!) make this outrageous parody of exploitation flicks a camp-lover's wet dream.

The plot for HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS is fashioned after those classic noir detective thrillers, complete with Raymond Chandler-style voice-over.  In his search for a missing teen, a private eye (B-movie stalwart Jay Richardson) stumbles across a chainsaw-weilding offshoot of an ancient Egyptian religious cult.  Members of the cult--played to great comic and erotic effect by gorgeous exploitation favorites Linnea Quigley and Michelle Bauer (credited here as Michelle McLellan), among others--pose as prostitutes in order to secure men for use in religious sacrifices.  At the reins of the cult is a hulking guru played by none other than the original THE TEXAS CHAIN SAW MASSACRE's Leatherface himself, Gunnar Hansen.

The film's must-see over-the-top sequences include the opening scene, in which Ms. Bauer, clad in nothing more than a shower cap, gleefully dismembers one of her Johns using the titular hardware; Ms. Quigley's outr&eacute; performance of ""The Virgin Dance of the Double Chainsaws""; and the outrageous climactic scene in which the two bodacious beauties duke it out in a chainsaw catfight.  Now THAT'S entertainment!

The 20th-Anniversary DVD edition of HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS features the film in anamorphic widescreen at its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.85:1.  The source print used for the digital transfer has lots of filmic artifacts like scratches and dust, and the audio track is palpably tinny, but in some ways these flaws actually add a sort of grindhouse quality to viewing experience.  (Indeed, such sensory debris was deliberately added to the films of Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino in their 2007 double feature GRINDHOUSE.) Bonus material on the disc includes a feature commentary with writer/director Fred Olen Ray and writer T.L. Lankford, a making-of featurette, the film's original trailer, and more.

HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS is essentially a spoof of those unintentionally funny, 1960s-era gore flicks of Herschell Gordon Lewis and his peers.  Though it will not appeal to every horror fan, those who enjoy high-camp, low-budget horror mixed with copious helpings of bare breasts and absurd, often low-brow humor are definitely in for a treat.  And at amazon.com's very reasonable price of admission, it won't cost you an arm and a leg to add the 20th-Anniversary edition of the film to your collection.",1229904000,4,2758,5.507109004739337
1430601,5,B00005J9OP,"Cheese never tasted so good. Director Fred Olen Ray gets the most out of his shoe string budget with the actors help.

He finds the runaway along with the cult she's invovled with and a hooker(Michele Bauer) who wants to cut him up. Hookers,chainsaws,murderous cults,whats not to like.

It starts with a detective looking for a missing girl (Quigley) and winds up running afoul of a chainsaw cult led by Gunnar Hansen.

Filthy and lots of NUDITY

the GEM to this is that GUNNAR HANSEN of LEATHERFACE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE fame is in it

and he runs like a girl at the end!

but yeah!

It's funny!",1147564800,,315,4.098360655737705
1430605,3,B00005J9OP,"If awards were given for exploitation movie titles, this one would qualify for Lifetime Achievement recognition. In this 1988 send-up of ""splatter"" films, female members of a blood cult pose as prostitutes and carve up their share of over-amorous males. With a title like this, you know exactly what kind of fare you're in for right from the start, so there's no point in expressing aesthetic outrage over any of the film's shortcomings. (This is not WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE'S HOLLYWOOD CHAINSAW HOOKERS, so keep your complaints to yourself.) Of special note is the participation of perennial ""Scream Queen"" Michelle Bauer, billed here as Michelle McLellan. Unlike some other SQs who perfunctorily scream and expose their breasts on cue, Bauer always conveys a sense of giddy enthusiasm in her performances; she actually seems to relish the idea of shrieking at the top of her lungs, getting splashed with fake blood, and cavorting buck nekkid. You've gotta love a trouper like that.",1132272000,2,979,5.163522012578617
1430606,4,B00005J9OP,This movie has it all from full frontal nudity too chainsaw side spliting laughs . The acting anit too bad and the one liners had me laughing a few times . Some cheesy gore and great naked ladies makes this movie a gem for any collection .,1118275200,2,239,4.1063829787234045
1430607,5,B00005J9OP,"This movie has everything any red-blooded American male B-movie buff could ever ask for. Beautiful women. Killing. Beautiful women. Comedy. Beautiful women. A wiseacre detective a la Mike Hammer on valium. And all of it on the cheap. If you're one of those PC Nazis, you'll hate it, but if you can take low-brow comedy with a grain of salt it'll be a fabulous movie-going experience.",1054684800,30,383,4.818181818181818
