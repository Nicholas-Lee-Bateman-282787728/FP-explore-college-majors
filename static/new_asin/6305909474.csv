1087543,5,6305909474,"Blowback is an unjustly obscure action/suspense flick.  It has an intellectual content that is much higher than most movies in its genre.

The killer in this movie has a unique method of execution each victim is killed in the style of a martyred saint.  A message with a bible reference is then placed in the corpse's mouth.  The director of Blowback, Mark L. Lester, is a prolific maker of thrilling movies with such films as Commando and Big Trouble in Little China to his credit.",1172361600,3,482,4.635294117647059
1087544,4,6305909474,"A RELIGIOUS SERIAL KILLER [JAMES REMAR] IS BOUGHT BACK TO LIFE AS AN ASSASSIN SHORTLY AFTER HIS EXECUTION. HOWEVER, ALL HE CAN THINK ABOUT IS GETTING VENGEANCE ON THE COP THAT CAUGHT HIM [MARIO VAN PEEBLES] AND THE PEOPLE THAT HELPED GET HIM CONVICTED. A VERY SUSPENSEFUL MOVIE THAT NEVER LETS UP. THE ACTING IS GOOD, THE ACTION IS GOOD, AND THE PLOT IS GOOD. I RECCOMEND ACTION FANS TO PICK THIS MOVIE UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.",1088726400,4,426,4.4743589743589745

1087546,2,6305909474,"Blowback follows very well trodden ground. A standard cop vs. serial killer movie, it sticks to the cliches of the genre.  The killer's ""twist"" is that he kills each victim in the style of a martyred saint, with a bible reference in a test tube placed in the mouth. Perhaps the intention is to echo other recent screen psychos like Seven's John Doe or Silence of the Lambs' Buffalo Bill. Blowback's villain is, however, like all the other characters, lacking in character depth and ultimately unconvincing.  Mark L. Lester, the director, has been a prolific producer of mediocre action movies, notably Commando and Big Trouble in Little China. Some of these can perhaps survive as late night movies to be watched over a few beers. Still, even among the lesser cop movies, there are a lot that should be seen before this one. Try Fallen or Bone Collector. Regarding the DVD, it's 3:4 format, with no features (not that you'd want them)",988156800,4,934,4.7592592592592595
