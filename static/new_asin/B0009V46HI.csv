Although there were a few tips I hadn't heard or read about before, this was the most boring, drawn out video I've ever tried to sit through. Very much an amateur production, the camera was fixed in one position through the whole class,facing the presenter head on through the tops of heads of his students sitting before him....I think the angle changed once to pick up a side view of the table he was standing behind to get a closer view of some rocks laying on the table. When a student asked a question or made a comment, it was too quiet to be picked up by the audio, so not only couldn't the voice be heard, but the presenter did not repeat the question for the camera before he answered it! I felt really lost trying to watch this and hear what was going on. Oh, but the great prize in this mess was wasting about 5 min. (minimum) while waiting for someone to get a tissue for the presenter because he had gotten some essential oil in his eye, and kept removing his glasses, and wiping with his hand over and over, and the camera never shut off, nor was this part edited out! I feel really ripped off paying $19.95 plus shipping for something so poorly produced, a gradeschool child would have done better! Sorry, but this is a thumbs down!",1239667200,2,1499,4.9523809523809526
8067194,5,B0009V46HI,"I have to say, I have read MANY books, and not found the information provided in this class setting DVD.  Peter teaches the class so well that you feel like you are actually there!  Having said that, the information he provides is in a well thought out order. Peter reminds us that we don't have to buy fancy stones or rocks to be effective, and that what we find in nature is more valuable to us.  Using his techniques and advice you will go you far. His ethical stance and honesty about the use of these items, and the combination of mixing them, and using oils and crystals in your spell work is down to earth and refreshing.  I can't wait to put it all to good use! He has opened the door for you, you only need to walk through it. Thank you for a much needed class on such a wonderful subject.

Sincerely, Chris",1118707200,12,816,4.205128205128205
