8574097,2,B00BUGZXZA,"Boring. Especially the long segment on the statues on Easter Island. And his conversations with these self-important people with mainly tourism interests? Uninteresting
Same old talk of Preservation Conservation and the importance of maintaining cultures. They sound like National Geographic interviewees from 30 years ago.  No one cares what they are talking about.",1379980800,4,366,5.90566037735849
8574098,5,B00BUGZXZA,"This is a wonderful DVD with top quality video of diverse areas of South America.

It is good enough that I would immediately purchase a Blu-ray version of this production if and when available.",1376611200,3,194,4.705882352941177
