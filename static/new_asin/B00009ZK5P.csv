7994639,4,B00009ZK5P,"Sensei Farkas offers superior use of the cane as a weapon for self defense. Unlike unrealistic techniques such as ""Canemasters"" which demonstrates techniques that a cane-user would never  physically  be able to execute, Master Farkas' method is easily adapted to a person with a bad hip, knee, back, or ankle. Sensei Farkas is a master technician and tactician. It is clear that he has dedicated his life to the instructing of martial arts that work in real life situations which it seems is not true of other cane tapes. As a person with a bad hip-I can do Sensei Farkas' tachniques! I can't say the same for ""Canemasters"" which get caught up in twirling, kicking, and joint locking with the cane. Those are things we cane users just can't do because the levering principles require immense torque on the waist, hip, and legs. Mark Shuey needs to look at Emil's tape to understand what a disabled person is confronted with when he must balance on his good leg and defend himself with the cane. Bravo to Farkas!",1284854400,6,1011,4.706214689265536
7994640,1,B00009ZK5P,If I could give this DVD a zero I would. It was a complete waste of money and the time it took to watch (even using fast forward it was a waste. WIthout a doubt this is the worst Cane DVD I have ever seen. usually I can find at least a few interesting or effective moves or insights in a DVD. Not in this one. We were so disappointed in it that I threw it in the trash after the first viewing.,1266364800,3,393,3.746987951807229
7994641,5,B00009ZK5P,"The instructor provides a clear, detailed method for learning to use a cane for self-defense. This is the best cane-fighting video anywhere - don't waste your money on the others (or on books - no book can possibly help you train for something like this).",1239926400,4,255,4.688888888888889
7994642,3,B00009ZK5P,"In ""The Cane: The Weapons Art of a Gentleman"" well-known martial artist Emil Farkas teaches you self-defense techniques using the common cane or walking-stick.  Mr. Farkas demonstrates basic strikes and blocks that anyone can master with a little bit or practice.

For anyone who normally carries a cane, learning the basic techniques taught in this DVD will certainly improve your ability to protect yourself when out on the street.  The techniques taught are simple and basic, so if you are already a trained martial artist, familiar with stick fighting, you will probably find nothing new in this DVD.  But... for the gentleman who wants to add a few techniques to his self-defense skills this DVD is OK.

I did find that there was some minor distortion in the audio in a couple places on the DVD.  This may be simple an error in my specific DVD, or a problem with the audio track in the master recording.  The other distraction I found in the audio of the DVD was that Mr. Farkas attempted to vocalize a hiss or whistling sound as he demonstrated the cane techniques.  Making these weird noises does nothing to improve one's ability to master the cane techniques - and having them incorporated into the DVD distracted somewhat from what would otherwise be a really good production.

Run time about 55 minutes.",1196467200,18,1313,4.8
