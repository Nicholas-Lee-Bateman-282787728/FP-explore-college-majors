7876958,1,6304773358,"I just loved the LEXX mini-series back in the days, so I got it on VHS as soon as it was released over here in Germany. Sadly, I had to find out those tapes contained versions of the movies that were quite heavily cut - something only too common for German releases. You might be surprised, but censorship on movies is really rigid in Germany. Even movies that are being released as NC-17 are very often cut-down versions. The latest example being ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre - The Beginning"", which will hit German cinemas - and probably DVD-players - solely in a version that's about 10 minutes shorter than the original, although being rated NC-17!

Anyway, don't even think of buying this DVD, since the censorship is immanent here, too. For example, movie no. 3 is stripped of SIXTEEN MINUTES of fun, violence, and sex on this release; movie no. 4 is missing nearly 20 scenes... and so on. This is absurd. Apart from that, as another reviewer already mentioned, these DVDs contain only German language, what renders them completely useless. Sadly, that's another practice all too common in Germany.

If you want to see this great mini-series in the way it was intended, look for the british DVDs from kult T.v., ""Lexx - The Movies"" 1.1 and 1.2, containing all four films in their uncut, english language versions. They're a little hard to hunt down nowadays, though. I've also been told there's a more recent, uncut canadian release from ""Koch Vision"", but I don't know any details about that one.

5 stars for the movies, -4 for this release. Equals 1 star only. Too bad.",1169078400,3,1574,4.716363636363637
7876959,2,6304773358,If you can't speak German avoid this. You really can't understand these movies without knowledge of German language. I really wonder who was that genius who decided it is not possible to hear original english speech and soundtrack. Only dubbed German is available. 20 eur to the trash - wham!,1166227200,4,292,4.86
7876960,5,6304773358,"Aside from the alluring absurdity of a robot head, undead assassin, cowardly space security guard and beautiful half-human, half cluster lizard love slave all flying about the 2 known universes in a living spaceship/bug, Lexx invites the watcher to step outside themselves and use their imagination. Without spelling things out, you come to realize that there is more going on in the garbage planet than first meets the eye. Unfolding into an interestingly complicated but entertaining story, you will never look at the word ""pattern"" quite the same again.",1080000000,,556,5.258426966292135
7876961,5,6304773358,"This is a great Sci-Fi movie. It has great caracters, cool space ships, cool costumes, and a great story line. I highly recommend this movie and the rest of the LEXX series. Every show is sexy, funny, with good visuals and great action. Don't miss it....",995846400,2,254,4.543478260869565
7876962,5,6304773358,"This has to be one of the greats in Sci-fi. I am already a Lexx fan, but this movie has completely blown my mind! This has to be the best of all the Lexx movies except for GigaShadow.",992476800,,183,3.8421052631578947
7876963,4,6304773358,"In this movie, 3 of 4, The lexx is hungry and lands on a garbage planet to feed. The alive crew decide that Kai is Dead dead not alive dead so leave the Lexx to bury him. They get into trouble with the occupants of the planet and Kai, who was alive dead, saves the day. Not quite as fabulous as the other 3 ( don't get me wrong, it is great but the others are better) but a must none th less.",981590400,,392,3.7349397590361444
7876964,5,6304773358,"This third film in the ""His Shadow"" series is as wonderful as  the others.  If you're looking for sci-fi that is fresh and different, look  no further.  Rutger Hauer is a fantastic addition to this series, and there  is nothing like it to date.  I recommend watching ""I Worship His  Shadow"" and ""Tales from a Parallel Universe"" first, if you  can find them.  The fourth, ""Giga Shadow"" has also recently been  released.  Watch and enjoy, and look for the series soon.  END",903744000,6,471,4.609756097560975
