2945085,1,B000VL7W3Q,"First of all, Heldorado is my favorite Roy Rogers movie.  This, however, isn't Heldorado.  It is a chopped up mess that leaves inexplicable gaps in the story with people saying and doing things which make no sense at all.  Whoever decided to edit this thing must have figured that anyone who would watch a Roy Rogers movie must not have any discernment whatsoever.  Although it has all of the expected fight sequences and chases, the character development all takes place without our getting to see it.  Roy's first meeting with Dale is absent without reason.  That scene lays the groundwork for the romantic tension which, in this cut, seems goofy, as does some of their dialogue, because the editing genius left in references to events which were in the movie but were deleted from this video.  A significant plot-explaining exchange among the bad guys is omitted. To put the crowning touch on this ridiculous artistic butchery, there is a murder (a rare event in a Roy Rogers movie) that is ordered by the boss, which seems absolutely whimsical and without explanation, although it is set up nicely in the real Heldorado.  Believe it or not, even bad guys don't usually kill people without a reason, especially if they are engaged in a for-profit criminal enterprise.  It's not good business.  In this version of Heldorado, however, the editor apparently believes all we care about is songs, fist fights and chases.  I purchased this in order to be able to watch Heldorado without carrying one of my two DVD versions with me.  I am sorry I wasted my money.  The pitiful thing about it is that Heldorado was hardly a long movie to begin with.  Now it's just a little jigsaw puzzle with about fifteen to twenty percent of the pieces missing...the important fifteen to twenty percent.  Why?",1310169600,6,1790,4.803921568627451
2945086,3,B000VL7W3Q,"I bought this particular version because one of the reviews said 73 minutes VHS/DVD.  Well, I've bought three versions of this same movie and I'm STILL trying to find one that is closer to being the complete movie.  I remember seeing this film on TV years ago and the cute scene where Roy meets Dale's character for the first time and mistakes her for the hat check girl and tips her a dime has been cut out of every one I have bought. No wonder they don't list the minutes on these!!! I had to buy three Apache Rose versions before getting one that was over 70 minutes and what had been cut out was several of Dale's scenes!!!!  Are they nuts! She put the fire and the fun in alot of scenes and they cut her out! Dale Evans is what made Roy's pictures different from all the good B cowboy films of the day. Many of the scenes left in this version are wonderful and the last scenes of '46 Las Vegas are priceless!! And I think the picture quality is better on this DVD, but since I have one version that is three minutes longer than this one, this version will be donated to the local library. I'll have to put Heldorado back on my list of RR and DE films to find full version of, because this one wasn't it!  I wish I could find a Happy Trails Theatre version, maybe it would be more complete.  But as yet, I haven't found it.",1267056000,,1327,4.147859922178989

Rogers plays himself and is recruited by the Governor of Texas to help him track down a ring of Nazi Sabateurs destroying defense plants in the wartime adventure.

Typical Roy Rodgers, as the plot is a bit thin (and was changed from the theatrical release for civilians, from the version shown free to troops overseas), but the characters, music, and scenery, are most enjoyable!

I recommend it for any Western or Roy Rogers fan!",1441411200,,553,4.924731182795699
