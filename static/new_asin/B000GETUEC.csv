8324326,1,B000GETUEC,"When you order Cory's ""Learn the Lost Art of Floor Moves"", Amazon will send you this video--""Crossroads""--instead. I read the reviews after I bought it, and apparently I am not the only one. ""Crossroads"" is a performance video that seems very home-made. Although the dancers are of course excellent, the production is worse than awful. I sent it back, read the reviews, and did not bother to replace it, because Amazon would just send me the wrong one again.",1512604800,,458,4.810126582278481

8324328,4,B000GETUEC,"Except for a brief segment at the very beginning which has some rather amateurish production values, this is a very entertaining tape for fans of both styles of dance and their accompanying music.  The dancers, including one male bellydancer, are excellent.  It can be viewed for entertainment or educational purposes.",1184803200,,318,5.34
