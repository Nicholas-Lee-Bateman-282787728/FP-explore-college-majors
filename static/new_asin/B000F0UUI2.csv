2547507,5,B000F0UUI2,I purchased this collection for my Dad as a Father's Day gift.  He recently expressed his love for the John Wayne/John Ford collaborations and I figured I'd order a few for him.  I was delighted to see some of their biggest hits in one collection. I might have to buy another one for myself.  The Searchers and Stagecoach are two outstanding movies but this entire set is a must have for film fans.  They just don't make them like this anymore and there will never be another Duke. He is still the greatest film icon of all time.  You need to hurry up and buy this one.,1149897600,6,569,4.280373831775701
2547508,5,B000F0UUI2,"First...the films

Stagecoach and The Searchers...two of the all time greatest movies ever made....Fort Apache and She Wore a Yellow Ribbon...perhaps only a notch below and the other films while not on  that level...wonderfully enjoyable.  The transfers are typically excellent  as WB tends to do...the cover art is the original 1sheet...very fun stuff.  The Searchers edition included is the ULTIMATE edition with tons of extra paper goodies!

Second..the extras!

Stagecoach...the American Masters documentary airing this month on the tube on Ford/Wayne is a nice bonus...the NEW 30 minute documentary on the actual making  of Stagecoach is REALLY GREAT....and i noticed its done by SPARKHILL , who did Wizard of Oz and some of the other great WB re-issues... THeir bonus featurettes on Fort Apache (Monument Valley) and the Searchers are also wonderful....truly there are hours of extras included in this package that will let the viewer learn much about both John Wayne...who people think  they know but perhaps don't and John Ford...who just might be the greatest director  of all time.

CHEERS to WB for  releasing  these films in lovingly done transfers and packing them with new and vintage featurettes to make them truly worth owning instead of waiting to catch on  TCM some day.....and the overall package and  price...well..terrific!

A collection of movies from arguably the greatest film director and starring arguably the greatest film  star in history....stop reading and BUY!",1149552000,53,1491,5.357758620689655
2547509,4,B000F0UUI2,"""The Searchers: Ultimate"" is the star of this highly anticipated boxed set, along with seven other films. A double-disc upgrade of ""Stagecoach"" and the DVD debut of ""Fort Apache"" join ""The Searchers"" as the best reasons to pony up.

Much is made of John Ford's ""cavalry trilogy"" -- ""Fort Apache,"" ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" (included) and ""Rio Grande"" -- but a good argument can be made for ""Stagecoach,"" ""Apache"" and ""Searchers"" as a Monument Valley triptych that emerged from Ford's evolving attitudes toward Native Americans.

Peter Bogdanovich, the dependable (and prolific) DVD commentator, says ""The Searchers"" is ""as good a Western as Ford made, maybe the best."" ""It's amazing how it was overlooked in its day,"" Bogdanovich says.

New-to-DVD extra features on ""The Searchers"" are the Bogdanovich commentary, a so-what introduction by Patrick Wayne and the excellent half-hour ""An Appreciation"" with directors Martin Scorsese, Curtis Hanson and John Milius. Warner had no alternate takes or deleted scenes to display, typical of the efficient Ford, Bogdanovich says.

""Stagecoach"" includes commentary from Ford biographer Scott Eyman, who says: ""The modern Western begins here.""

Ford and John Wayne's tense yet affectionate and enduring relationship is chronicled in the recent ""American Masters"" profile ""The Filmmaker and the Legend,"" a ""Stagecoach"" extra. The informative but padded docu runs 90 minutes. (It contains numerous spoilers.) The 2006 half-hour docu ""Stagecoach: A Story of Redemption"" includes testimony from Bogdanovich, who dubs it ""the first psychosexual Western.""

Images from the trailer and docu clips give a pretty good idea of what the restorers were up against with ""best available film elements."" Video quality is OK despite the wear.

DVD newcomer ""Fort Apache"" (1948) looks great, with minimal wear on its crisp black-and-white images (from original nitrate elements) and bugle-brisk audio.

The (single) DVD has no documentary on the intriguing film, a shame. It does include a 15-minute piece on Monument Valley, covering Ford's significant and seemingly beneficial role in the Indian reservation's history. ""It always seemed like plagiarism to shoot in Monument Valley after Ford,"" Bogdanovich says.

There is a good deal of repetitive material in this set's extras, but it's all good stuff. Unfortunately, there's nothing on the music in Ford's films, such as Max Steiner's score for ""The Searchers.""",1149552000,13,2439,5.5
2547510,5,B000F0UUI2,"This is a good set for the true and deep John Wayne fan.  It is also a good look for those who only know the Duke for his later films.  This is an unusual collection to view.  What can be said about Stagecoach.  It is an oldtime classic style western that might seem a little stagey, but you see John Wayne become a star.  Fort Apache had the pairing of Wayne with Henry Fonda.  She Wore A Yellow Ribbon is part of John Ford's cavalry trilogy and excellent to boot.  3 Godfathers is a Christmas movie that is quite touching.  The Wings of Eagles is a true biography of Spig Wead.  The first time I watched, I anticipated the happy ending but was I fooled.  I could go on in detail, but suffice it to say you will see John Wayne in a different light after viewing this set.",1148774400,9,772,4.120805369127517
2547511,3,B000F0UUI2,"This collection may be somewhat overpriced considering that many John Wayne fans already owned movies that is part of this collection. She Wore a Yellow Ribbon/They Were Expendable/Long Voyage/3 Godfathers were all released previously and I don't see any reason to buy them again. I am sure most consumers probably feel the same way.

The welcome addition lies with Fort Apache and Wings of Eagles which will definitely be brought by all Wayne fans. (In fact by all movie fans unless they were rise by wolves.) The special edition of Stagecoach and Searchers should be brought but that opinion can be considered subjective since they too have been released before and its depends on economics and needs of each buyer.

It is interesting to note that one of the most important John Wayne/John Ford films of their joint careers, Quiet Man, is not in this collection. The absent of this film is quite puzzling and may have to do with getting the rights to it.

In my case, I will buy them separately. Fort Apache and Wings of Eagles first, special editions later on. Save money on the long run doing it that way. Its too bad that Fort Apache didn't get the special edition treatment, its the best of the Cavalry Trilogy.

So depending on how much money you can afford, this collection as a whole, may or may not be worth the money. For most I supposed, it will not although for someone who don't have a John Wayne collection yet, this would be a great way to start one.",1148774400,14,1466,4.583969465648855
2547512,5,B000F0UUI2,"I have seen these movies and own some in dvd or laser disc format.  I am going to purchase this set asap.

One correction must be made to the previous review.  Monty Clift was not in ""The Searchers"". Jeffrey Hunter played John Wayne's sidekick in the quest to find Wayne's niece (Natalie Wood) who had been kidnapped by the ""Comanch"".  ""The Searchers"" is one of my five favorite movies of all time.

I can't wait to own this set.",1147392000,15,429,4.379746835443038
2547513,4,B000F0UUI2,"Whenever you think of John Ford, you think of John Wayne.  They made many film classics including the greatest The Quiet Man (which is not part of this set).  But we have 8 very good films of theirs including two new special editions.

Five of the films are great westerns including the classic The Searchers which costars Montgomery Clift and a young Natalie Wood.  Wood is kidnapped by some indians and Clift and Wayne go to find her.  But can they do it before she is brainwashed into the indian life.

Stagecoach has an all star cast and made Wayne a star this was their first teaming together.  This is considered the classic film western.

Fort Apache features Henry Fonda as a overly stiff and unyeilding commanding officer and Shirley Temple (in an adult role) as his daughter.  His arrogance leads to a staggering massacre.

She Wore a Yellow Ribbon is probably the lesser of the westerns.  Wayne is about to retire but he must lead a caravan to safety.  Joanna Dru plays a dilitente who is playing with the affections of two soldiers.

3 Godfathers or Three Outlaws and a Baby.  The outlaws on the run come across a baby and her dying mother and promise to get the baby to safety.

The Wings of Eagles is the only film in the collection with the greatest Wayne costar Maureen O'Hara and is a true story of Navy flier Frank Wead.

They Were Expendable is the true story of how PT boats were brought into the Pacific Theater during WWII Robert Montgomery is Wayne's costar and they fight over Donna Reed.

In most films you will find Ford regulars Ward Bond and Oscar winner Victor McLaglen.  Ford had a crew that worked in front and behind the camera in many of his films.

The only complaint that I have with most of Ford's films is that he inserts scenes of comic relief that just don't work but if this is the worst complaint that anyone has, then it isn't much (but why I rate it 4 instead of 5 stars).

This is one of the best priced box sets and is a great value even at list price.  If you love westerns you must have this collection!!!!!",1147219200,17,2054,4.395225464190982
2547514,5,B000F0UUI2,"Now the entire Calvary Trilogy is on DVD.  John Wayne and the ""Old Master"" John Ford.  The Calvary Trilogy is made  up of  Fort Apache, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande.  I have been waiting for this release for two years! The Calvary Trilogy with Wayne and Ford were made after World War II and Ford put into these movies the comradeship, emotions and values of loyalty he had experienced and learned in the war as a naval officer.  These are great movies that are to be treasured.

The set will also include The Wings of Eagles where Ward Bond plays a movie director ""John Dodge"" patterned after Ford. A Great Set!",1145059200,19,623,4.412280701754386

2547539,3,B000F0UUI2,"Caution is advised.  Warner Bros. is selling two versions of this collection that have the same barcode?! The one I got is a clamshell that has seven DVDs inside, and even though it says on the back of the cardboard box and the back of the plastic box that this package contains the two disc special addition of the searchers, it does not have that second desk and there's no space for it inside the package. This collection is in fact sold both ways, with the same barcode. The one that includes the two disc special edition is a much bigger cardboard box holding seven separate clamshell boxes, one of which is indeed the two disc special edition of the searchers. The front of the cardboard box of both additions looks exactly the same. So I would say if you order it as advertised on Amazon as having the two disc edition of the searchers and only get one disc, return it.",1445731200,4,876,4.407407407407407

These remasters are some of the best that I have seen. The Searchers deluxe set is probably the highlight with booklets, photographs and a reprint of the original comic.

Waynes screen presence was charismatic and memorable. These films give a solid introduction to the great Wayne films - ""The Searchers"", ""Fort Apache"" and ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" are quintessential American westerns.

2547556,5,B000F0UUI2,An excellent selection of John Wayne movies. The Searchers has been rated one of his best with She Wore a Yellow Ribbon my all time favorite. Fort Apache is excellent also. The Long Voyage and They were Expendable were minor roles for him but all in all a great collection of films. The man became the all american hero even before his passing.,1174435200,3,344,4.476190476190476
2547557,4,B000F0UUI2,"This is one of the larger collections that came out last year and whatever else you may think about John Wayne, he was the most prolific star of his (perhaps of all) time, twice the output of Humphrey Bogart, for example.

John Ford was also quite prolific but many of his early ones are lost. Still, his place and time as one of the great auteurs intrigues many of cinephile.

Some favorites are missing but are available, such as ""Rio Grande"", ""The Quiet Man"" and ""The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance"".  The extras for this set are in some cases, non existant, while some are repeats, but the main reason to own this set is for the films themselves.

""Stagecoach"" - This 1939 Western stands as the turning point for both Ford's and especially Wayne's careers.  This is also quite an ensemble piece for which Donald Meek, Thomas Mitchell (was Oscar for this), John Caradine, Andy Devine, George Bancroft, Louise Pratt and Berton Churchill spend much screen time as the occupants of the stagecoach along with JW and Clair Trevor.  Wayne and Trevor provide the love story, she as the whore being run out of town, he the vengeful outlaw who Bancroft wants to lock up for Wayne's own good.  But all are misfits in this journey and even though quite laughable today, a fun movie to watch.  Alas, the native Americans are basically just ducks in a shooting gallery.

""The Long Voyage Home"" is another ensemble piece and does have the odd casting of Wayne as the big Swede who doesn't hit back.  Mitchell returns and is actually the main character in this movie, which does have the great bittersweet language of Eugene O'Neil.  This offers what a good actor Ward Bond was when called to be when he has his death scene.

""They Were Expendable""  Ford won two Oscars for documentaries shot in World War Two.  Wayne made many war pictures but this is my favorite one.  The dialogue and settings are quite believable for the most part and Robert Montgomery displays dignity as the one in charge.  A nice haunting scene is when Wayne gets caught off talking to Donna Reed with the realization he might never see her again. This also has none of the crazy heroics that many films had (Wayne guilty in many of those) and a good humor with the supporting characters.

""3 Godfathers"" is truly an offbeat film.  Wayne, Pedro Amadariz and Harry Carey, Jr., are actually bank robbers, quite likable though, who save a woman's baby while running away from sheriff Ward Bond.  It is through this baby that the three find redemption though it's only Wayne who has the happy ending.  In its way, this is a very spiritual film.

""Fort Apache"" is actually my favorite film here.  Fords prints the facts and shows them distorted by Wayne for his benefit who he can effectively lead the troop.  Henry Fonda plays quite the unsympathic custer character who tricks Cochise to come back.  The scene that Fonda has with Cochise, who laments in Spanish the deplorable conditions but chills the white man's chilling response, is brilliant.  The adult Shirley Temple provides support here with the bland John Agar.  Also very good, Ward Bond, Victor McLagden and Pedro Armandariz.

""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is quite a melodramtic film with Wayne talking to tombstones and weeping half the time.  Still, great comedic support from Victor McLagden.  ""Don't apolagize, it's a sign of weakness"" Wayne repeats over and over.  However, both Agar and Carey, Jr., aren't given much to do.  Ben Johnson does what he does best.  It's interesting that George O'Brien was Ford's big star in the silent era and here and Fort Apache just strictly a sad character actor.  Still, John Wayne makes this watchable and the gold watch scene quite effective.

""The Searchers"" which along with ""Stagecoach"" gets a second disk of extras.  This is the definitive Wayne-Ford movie, as good as any film noir as the antihero makes good.  Wayne plays the racist Ethan Edwards and Jeff Hunter co stars as the other searcher who must accompany Wayne before Wayne finds and murders his niece, played by the beautiful Natalie Wood.  The firing into the dead Indian's eyes, the shooting of buffalo, the shooting of Indians in the back, the digust of looking at white women are among the most powerful scenes Wayne or Ford have ever done.  It would have been interesting if Wayne actually killed Wood because that's the actual story, but thank God he didn't.  This film is not a comfortable film to watch and it's not intended to be.  The race issues it addresses still hold true today.

""The Wings of Eagles"" is in my opinion, the weakest Wayne-Ford movie.  There's no sense of period.  The slapstick doesn't work for me and Maureen O'Hara's character's alcoholism is never addressed.  However, Wayne's determination to move that toe, strongly assisted by Dan Dailey, makes up for a lot.  Also, way too briefly, Ward Bond as John Ford.  Also fun is hearing Wayne's comment of bringing in the seventh calvary when viewing an early Clark Gable movie.",1174176000,5,4981,4.746216530849825

Moreover, I prefer Henry Fonda to John Wayne for John Ford films because Henry Fonda was a fine actor, and John Wayne never showed good performance(Probably he could shout).

2547574,5,B000F0UUI2,"THE JOHN WAYNE JOHN FORD FILM COLLECTION is the finest DVD boxed set I have bought all year.  It has almost nothing but masterpieces--not just great westerns, but great non-westerns like the Merchant Marine drama THE LONG VOYAGE HOME (1940), based on a few Eugene O'Neill one-act plays; and the World War Two PT boat adventure THEY WERE EXPENDABLE (1945), one of the great war films of all time.  One watches this set over two weeks and comes away with renewed respect for John Wayne as an outstanding actor, but also downright awe for John Ford as a director.  Not the nicest person, but boy could he direct westerns in Monument Valley.  And the Ireland of THE QUIET MAN (1952), which is not included in this set--wrong studio.

The set's crown jewel is the 50th anniversary remastering of THE SEARCHERS (1956), which includes not just a shimmering transfer of this dark and tragic masterpiece, but also a rare comic book, publicity material, lobby cards, and an audio commentary by Peter Bogdanovich.  Ethan Edwards, post Civil War loner and indian hater when his niece is kidnapped and killed by Comanches, may be John Wayne's greatest performance in a sea of great performances in this DVD crown jewels box.  But a little bit of Hank Worden's and Ken Curtis' unwelcome comedy relief goes a long way.

I personally think STAGECOACH (1939), with Wayne's first important role as the Ringo Kid, is the equal to THE SEARCHERS.  It has also been remastered and includes an audio commentary by author Scott Eyman, an ""American Masters"" documentary on both Wayne and Ford, a new documentary on STAGECOACH as a neglected treasure, and a radio production with Randolph Scott and Claire Trevor.  The movie is about nine people traveling by stagecoach through indian territory and features an Oscar-winning score by Max Steiner--the same year he did not win for GONE WITH THE WIND!

The dusty B&W FORT APACHE (1948) and brilliant Technicolor SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON (1949) make up 2/3 of John Ford's Cavalry trilogy with Wayne at his peak.  (Part three, RIO GRANDE, is not included here because it is a different studio).  APACHE has a nasty Henry Fonda as an indian-hating Commanding Officer of Fort Apache in Utah's Monument Valley.  Wayne is his likeable subordinate who must carry out orders he personally disagrees with in a role that mirrors THE SEARCHERS.

YELLOW RIBBON may be my personal favorite Ford Monument Valley western, even more than THE SEARCHERS.  It has Wayne as a Commanding Officer about to retire after a lifetime of Army service, but not until unfriendly nearby indians settle down.  Winton Hoch's magnificent color photography, inspired by Remington paintings, won a richly-deserved Oscar.

Also set in Ford's beloved Monument Valley, but not a Cavalry drama, is the Technicolor 3 GODFATHERS (1949).  It has Wayne, Pedro Armendariz, and newcomer Harry Carey, Jr. as outlaws out in the desert who come across an abandoned baby at Christmas time.  This story is the third version of a movie done previously in 1929 and 1936 in B&W.  I've seen all three versions and like Ford's the best.  It also stars Ford regular Ward Bond as a sheriff out to get the three men--but with a wife who wants the baby.  This is a pleasantly sentimental movie, often shown on cable at Christmas season, and reveals a soft side of a gruff filmmaker.

The last of eight treasures in this Ford and Wayne DVD set is the lightweight (and color) THE WINGS OF EAGLES (1957).  It is the true story of  Commander Frank ""Spig"" Wead, a pioneer aviator in the 1920's and later screenwriter in the 1930's and 1940's.  One of his finest scripts is for Ford's THEY WERE EXPENDABLE in 1945.  EAGLES, also starring Dan Dailey and Maureen O'Hara, is the sentimental and labor of love story of Spig Wead's life over several decades.

Almost all of these film classics come with an original theatrical trailer, if you want to see how the movies were originally promoted.  That especially interests me when masterpieces like THE SEARCHERS, THE LONG VOYAGE HOME, and THEY WERE EXPENDABLE get shut out of the Oscar race, especially for Picture and Wayne's performance.  But, as they say, time is the key factor with movies.  And people still want to see these Ford/Wayne movie gems, long after even Best Picture Oscar winners are forgotten.  Should you buy or rent these from Netflicks?  It is an expensive set, in the $55-$75 range.  But if you buy the set, it averages out to only about $8 a picture, a ridiculously great buy.  Maybe it can be a Christmas present.  Happy viewing!",1159660800,12,4556,4.824742268041237

All for a little over $50! Particularly impressive - ""They Were Expendable"", the WW II PT Boat story. Good acting from top to bottom, great black and white film work, and really good, stirring, special effects in a couple of spots.

Also, ""The Three Godfathers"", a mystical John Wayne western? Interesting.

Only confusing omission - no ""The Quiet Man"", also a Ford/Wayne project. ??? I guess you've always got to leave something off to keep the customer interested. And come to think of it, ""Rio Grande"" was also not included, so obviously you can't have everything.

This is Wayne's best preformance ever(by the way he can act)and one of(MAY BE THE BEST)the best western ever. Wayne can be brutal and then commpassionet. The supporting cast is also excellent,Jeffery Hunter, Natlie Wood, Ward Bond and Vera Miles. 2). Stagecoach, 1939 (What a year for motion pictures).John Ford made John Wayne a household name by casting Wyne in the lead in this film. Wayne's introduction in the film is the best ever on screen. The camera is out of focus when it draws in on Wayne then comes back into focus(a mistake,but left in by Ford)outstanding. Then you have Thomas Mitchell's oscar winning preformance and the beautifal Clair Treavor. 3). Fort Apache The BEST in the calvary trilogy and the first time on dvd. Henry Fonda as the commander(another of John Ford's favorite actors)with devistating affects. Fonda is obsessed with with getting the apache and Cochise back on the reservation at any cost. Wayne is caught in the middle. Fonda is a (George Amstrong Custard) in many ways. 4). She Wore A Yellow Ribbon. I think that this is one of  Ford's  best. And another great preformance by John Wayne. An ageing officer trying to avoid more bloodshed in his last few weeks of service. This is a masterpiece. 5). 3 Godfathers  Fugitive bank robbers are chased by a posse and are forced to the desert. There they find a dying woman and her newborn. They make a promise to the dying women that they can't go back on. They won't abandon the baby. Great story telling. 6). The Wings Of Eagles, The true story of Cmdr. Frank ""Spig"" Wead an aviation pioneer and writer. Maureen O'Hara and Dan Dailey co-star. Real battle footage. 7). The Long Voyage Home. Wayne's follow up to Stagecoach. This film was nominated for six Academy Awards. The crewmen on this ship search the sky for German planes, while in the North Atlantic and hope they survive. One of the best American films about life at sea. And 8). They Were Expendable PT-Boat action at it's best. World War 2 at it bleakest hours. The defenders of the Philippines and John Wayne and Robert Montgomery as PT-Boat commanders, try to give the U.S. war effort time to regroup after the devastion of Pearl Harbor.

2547589,5,B000F0UUI2,"If there was ever a collection that deserves the term, ESSENTIAL, the ""John Wayne-John Ford Film Collection"" is it. While I wish ""Rio Grande"" had been included (which would have finally offered buyers the entire ""Cavalry Trilogy"", together), the set has so many remarkable titles that it really sells itself!

The centerpiece is, of course, a new, definitive edition of ""The Searchers"", Ford and Wayne's finest collaboration. A masterpiece that defined the 'epic' western, it was unbelievably ignored by the Oscars when released (I suspect, as a backlash against Wayne's right-wing support of the Communist 'witch hunts' of the film industry in the fifties). Time has only increased it's luster, and the astonishing, subtle performance by the Duke as a bitter, bigoted ex-Rebel on a five-year quest to kill his 'soiled', Comanche-kidnapped niece.

Besides the best 'remastered' print, ever, the Special Features include commentary by Peter Bogdanovich, two terrific documentaries, Warner's 1956 promotional TV spots (hosted by an 'out-of-place' Gig Young), and some fabulous production materials.

""Stagecoach"" is as important, historically, as ""The Searchers"", as Ford 'lifted' the entire genre, through this film, into an era of adult storytelling. A gamble for the director (as no major studio wanted B-movie actor John Wayne as the lead, and tried to force Ford to use Gary Cooper), the film is a testament to the director's loyalty to Wayne (who would finally achieve stardom as the Ringo Kid), and a showcase for some of Hollywood's best character actors (with Thomas Mitchell winning a Supporting Actor Oscar).

A package of great Special Features includes two documentaries, and a radio version of the film, with Claire Trevor, and Randolph Scott(!!??) as the Ringo Kid.

""The Long Voyage Home"", Ford's second teaming with Wayne, is an unfairly ignored, beautifully realized filming of Eugene O'Neill's works. Ford loved the sea, and stories that emphasized 'Family', and this tale of Merchant Marine seamen facing the growing threat of Nazi U-Boat attacks offers his 'stock company' of actors (Mitchell, Ward Bond, Barry Fitzgerald, etc.) in beautifully etched portrayals. Young Wayne, for the only time in his career, attempts an accent, playing a likable young Swede, and he is quite effective in the role.

""Fort Apache"" is considered by many the best of Ford's 'Cavalry' trilogy, and was WAY ahead of it's time, in it's sympathetic portrayal of Cochise, and the abuse and exploitation of Native Americans. Henry Fonda (as a variation of Custer) is a martinet commander hoping to 'make a name' by subduing the Apaches, ignoring the conditions that created the crisis. Snubbing the wisdom of second-in-command Wayne, he provokes a confrontation that leads to disaster!

Framed with the humor, romance, and camaraderie audiences expected from Ford, the underlying drama lifts the film into a richly-deserved status as a Classic.

""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"", the second 'Cavalry' film, is far friendlier, and more sentimental, offering Wayne one of his best 'character' roles, as an aging Captain facing retirement just as the Indians unite to make war, after the Custer massacre. The only of the trilogy filmed in color (which would win an Oscar), Ford's 'stock company' was never better, particularly Victor McLaglen, and young Ben Johnson.

""3 Godfathers"", Ford's second filming of this western variation of ""The Gift of the Magi"", is a small, but loving parable of three likable outlaws (Wayne, Pedro Armendariz, and Harry Carey, Jr.), redeemed when a dying mother entrusts her infant's care to them, in the desert. Pursued by Ward Bond and a posse, the trio, under a burning sun, learn self-sacrifice, protecting the baby. With frequent religious references, this may not be a film for everyone, but it's message is universal, and inspiring.

""They Were Expendable"", Ford's only Hollywood WWII movie, was truly daring, focusing not on victory, but on the Navy's constant defeats, following Pearl Harbor. PT boat skippers Robert Montgomery (a real-life Navy veteran) and Wayne, and their crews, show courage as they fight a holding action, knowing that America would eventually rebuild their fleet, and achieve victory.

Shunned by a war-weary public in 1945, the film is now viewed as one of the finest war films ever made!

Finally, there is ""Wings of Eagles"", the real-life story of Navy aviator/Hollywood screenwriter Frank 'Spig' Wead (portrayed by Wayne). Ford was friends with Wead (his character even appears in the film, under another name, played by Ward Bond, having a ball in the role), but after some early 'pure Ford' humor, the film turns dramatic, and offers an unsettling portrait that leaves the biggest question unanswered...Why would Wead ignore his devoted wife (played by the luminous Maureen O'Hara), when his life is threatened in an accident, and turn to his Navy buddies, instead? There is a story here that Ford chooses to ignore, making the film less effective, despite a strong Wayne performance (ending the film without his hairpiece!), and a remarkable sequence in which Wead, by sheer willpower, teaches himself to walk again, after the accident.

I salivated when I learned this set would be available, but for some reason put off preordering/buying it. I recently read a review that points out that Warner screwed up the Technicolor settings on this release of The Searchers (weird, considering they're the ones who with AOL developed the Ultra-Resolution ""edge-enhancement"" technology that constitutes the current state of the art in Technicolor restoration--at least for those shot using the three-strip process). It seems that they're aware of the problem and are planning to correct it by timing it to an IB print such as that used for the laser disk release, but until such time, fans might want to think twice before opening their wallets. I, for one, want to view Technicolor films the way their directors/cameramen intended them to be seen, with the original color calibration intact.

  THE SEARCHERS-AN ANTI-RACIST CLASSIC!  *****

  What can I say about this GREAT Anti-racist Western,by the Greatest American Director?Ever since I first saw it(on TV) 30+ tears ago,I loved it for its excellent Technicolor photography,wonderful score,outstanding performances,and hard as nails indictment of racism and bigotry,and what hatred does to a human's soul.

  This is the 50th anniversary of its original release and it hasn't lost any of its splendor and WB has issued a wonderful DVD presentation,including an excellent audio commetary by Peter Bogdanovich.

  The story opens with Ethan Edwards(John Wayne) returning home to Texas three years AFTER the Civil war has ended. Ethan was a Confederate soldier. In Texas he is reunited with his brother Walter Coy,his wife(Dorothy Jordan,who MAY have been Ethan's lover) and their 2 daughters and only son. Also in the family is Martim Pawley(Jeffery Hunter)who was rescued by Ethan after Martin's family was killed by the Comanche,Martin is also part Indian,and Ethan doesn't like "" NON PURE WHITES"".

  An Indian raid occurs on the Jorgenson (John Qualen and family)farm and Ethan, and Martin are joined by a posse lead by preacher-lawman andex-Confederate friend of Ethan's Ward Bond chase after the Comanche. While the posse is away Ethan's brother farm is raided with father,mother,and son killed,and the two daughters taken captive.

  Ethan,Martin,and Brad Jorgenson(Harry Carey,jr) start a search for the two girls,early on Brad is killed with Ethan and Martin carrying on. As the years go by Ethan""s hatred toward Debbie(Natalie Wood)grows and grows because by now she has probably slept with an Indian,and in Ethan's eyes she is no longer  WHITE and he feels that he MUST kill her.

  After seeing this film how anyone can say that John Wayne can't act is beyond me,he gives a wonderful performance. In fact every cast member does an outstanding job with the exception of Ken Curtis,as a would be husband of Vera Miles,is somewhat annoying,but over the years I've come to lessen my eomewhat hard feelings towards his performance. Adding to the pleasure of watching the film is seeing many members of the""John Ford"" stock company-John Qualen,Carey jr.,Olive Carey(his real-life mother),Cliff Lyons,and Hank Worden.

  Some people rank The Searchers as the all-time greatest Western,I think it ranks at#2 behind Ford's Fort Apache being #1,with My Darling Clementine,and The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance following right behind. DVD-5 Stars  The Film-5 stars.

  STAGECOACH-IT MADE WAYNE A STAR  *****

  This film made John Wayne a star! Up until 1939 ""A"" Westerns were a rarity,but in that year in addition to Stagecoach,Union Pacific,Dodge City,Destry Rides Again,and I believe The Oklahoma Kid (starring Cagney,with Bogart in support) were all released. Stagecoach is by far the best.

  I'm not going to go into many details of the story of the film,because I believe most of the readers of this review know the story. The movie may seem cliche'd today,but back in 1939,the story of,mostly,strangers who are thrown together in a dangerous situation was something new and fresh.

  The cast is excellent from Thomas Mitchell's druken ""Doc Boone"",to Claire Trevor's Dallas(and Wayne's love interest),to Donald Meek,John Carradine,and Andy Devine,as the stagecoach driver. It is these performances,under Ford's direction that raises this film above the ordinary.

  Included is an excellent audio commetary by Scott Eyman,who in my review of ""My Darling Clementine ! was to harsh on,mainly because of his commets concerning (one of my favorites)Linda Darnell.  The DVD 5 Stars  The Film  5 Stars

  FORT APACHE  THE GREATEST WESTERN OF ALL TIME  *****

  Fort Apache,the first of the so-called John Ford cavalry  trilogy(She Wore a Yellow Ribbon and Rio Grande being the other two) is THE GREATEST WESTERN EVER MADE!

Henry Fonda,playing against type,is outstanding as Col. Owen Thursday the made man who seeks glory no matter what the cost,and John Wayne also playing against type,as a less than gung-ho(liberal-?common sense) army type. This film is ford's recreation of Custer's last stand and in the filming shows the arrogance of many ""whites"" as epitomized by the WASP'y Thursday,who also looks down on the Irish,NEVER a good sigh in a Ford Film. Among other things Thursday does not approve of his daughter's(shirley Temple) romance with young Irish Catholic officer Michael Shannon O' Rourke(John Agar-in real life the future Mr. Temple) whose name Col. Thursday constanly gets wrong,he substitutes another Irish name.

  Excellent also are George O'Brien,Victor McLaglen,Anna Lee,Pedro Armendariz,Guy Kibbee,Ward Bond,and a host of othersThe DVD has one drawback-NO audio commetary. DVD 4 1/2 Stars  The Film 5 Stars.--The GREATEST WESTERN EVER!

  THE LONG VOYAGE HOME  A MASTERPIECE!  *****

  John Wayne with a Swedish accent? Yes! But is Thomas Mitchell's film,who as Driscoll is the core of the film,along with great support for Ian Hunter,in his finest role as ""Smitty"",a tormented Englishmen,Barry Fitzgerald,Arthur Shields(Barry's real-life brother)Ward Bond,John Qualen,Joe Sawyer,Carmen Morales(why didn't she have a Hollywood career,she is very beauiful and a fine""spitefire"" personality)and in her film debut(later Ford regular)Mildred Natwick.

  This is a story of the merchant marine,updated from WW1 to WW2 from from four Eugene O'Neill playlets,their trials,tribulations,hardships,and loves and one of Ford's greatest films which is saying a lot. No audio commetary is the only drawback. I have also a separate(longer) review of this film on another page.  DVD  4 1/2 Stars  The film  5 stars

  THE WINGS OF EAGLES  The ""SPIG""WEAD STORY  +++++

  Frank ""Spig"" Wead was a Naval Air Pilot in WW1 and WW2 Naval Officer and in between a Hollywood screen writer. The Wings of Eagles is his life story as told by his longtime friend John Ford.

 As portrayed by John Wayne and director Ford, Wead is to me, a patriot yes,but also a very immature man who by his blind devotion to the Navy he is destroying his marriage to his wife Min,played touchingly by Maureen O'Hara and whose part was drastically reduced because of objections raised by the Wead family due to the showing of Min Wead's alcoholic problems. To me the cutting of the key role lessens the overall effectiveness of the motion picture,which I first saw at the TIFFIN Theatre in Chicago,in the summer of '57. Dan Dailey(as Wead's sidekick ""Jughead"" Carson),Ken Curtis,Ken Tobey, Ward Bond (as John""Dodge"" a film director) and Sig Rumann lend an able hand. No audio commetary.  DVD 4 1/2 Stars  The film(dispite its flaws)  5 Stars.

  SHE WORE A YELLOW RIBBON  WAYNE STOPS INDIAN WAR!  *****

  Four of the greatest Western male film roles are by one man.""Tom Dunson"" in ""Red River"",""Ethan Edwards"" in ""The Searchers"",""Kirby York"" in ""Fort Apache"" and ""Nathan Brittles"" in ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"",and that man is John Wayne and HE COULD ACT,maybe he needed Ford ad Hawks to guide him,but he COULD ACT,and this is coming from someone who detested Wayne's politics.

She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,in glorious Technicolor,is the second leg in the Ford cavalry triolgy and the 2cd best,though many critics rank it # 1

Romance,between John Agar and Joanne Dru,Indian attacks,evil Suttlers(this one played by Harry Woods,Fort Apache had Grant Withers playing a similiar and larger role) and broad Irish comedy(supplied by Victor McLaglen) are all stirred together by Ford to make an amazing cavalry Western. Such Ford regulars as Mildred Natwick,Ben Johnson,Arthur Shields,George O Brien,and Harry Carey,jr all add to the enjoyment of this beutifully photographed,by Winton Hoch,classic,No audio commetary DVD  4 1/2 Stars  The Film  5 Stars

  THEY WERE EXPENDABLE  WORD WAR 2 DRAMA  4 1/2 Stars

  From a screenplay by Frank ""Spig"" Wead,from the earlier reviewed,""The Wings of Eagles"",comes a WW2 drama set in the Pacific starring John Wayne,and one of my least favorite actors,Robert Montgomery,and it is his ""acting"" that lowers this otherwise fine film to 4 1/2 Stars. John Ford directs with his usual skill,and Wallace Ford,Leon Ames,Wayne and Donna Reed all do nice work, in a film,based on true incidents invovling wooden PT boats,in the Phillipines,and the seemingly hopeless situtition in which the Navy men find themselves in. Montgomery's ""performance' while NOT terrible ruins,to a minor extent the film for me. No audio commetart DVD 4 Stars  The Film 4 1/2 Stars

  3 GODFATHERS  WAYNE,ARMENDARIZ,and CAREY jr. AS THREE ""BAD"" MEN  *****

John Wayne,Pedro Armendariz,and Harry Carey,Jr, rob a bank,and in their getaway their canteens are shot full of holes,and in the desert that's not good,So the bandit trio try to get to various remote train stations that have water wells,well the Marshall,played by Ward Bond stations some members of his posse,at these stations to twart the boys attemp to get water. Along the way our three badmen come across dieing young widow Mildred Natwick,who has just given birth. The boys become the ""Godfathers"" to the infant and the story goes on from there.

 Sounds a little corny and trite,right! WRONG! In Ford's hands this story which has been filmed at least 5 times,including once by Ford as a silent,is turned into a near classic. The beautiful Technicolor photography by Winton Hoch and thrilling Western score by Richard Hageman add to the visual and listening pleasure as does the performances by the 3 leads and the other players,many from the Ford ""Stock Company"",Bond,Ms Natwick,Mae Marsh, and Hank Worden.

The price of this set varies between $51 and $56.
This box includes The Ultimate Searchers costs $28; The 2 Disc StageCoach is around $20.  I added it up; Buying each of these 8 films from amazon today would cost approx. $125! This set is a bargain at $56 or even $60.

They could have been cheap and put in the 2-Disc Searchers rather than The Ultimate Searchers [still just 2 discs]--with the promotional items and comic book reprint.  But they didn't skimp.
Seriously, for the Ultimate Searches is a nice package. It almost looks out of place amongst the DVD cases with old movie posters for covers.  Trust me.  You will Like The Ultimate Searchers Package and the movie too!

This box set is great. Even if you already have the movies that were already available and wanted just the Ultimate Searchers, Fort Apache and the other 2 films new to DVD you would spend more than $55.

8116150,3,B000F0UUI2,"I love this set, however I have to say that for some strange reason, Fort Apache started giving me trouble about 2 months ago. I had to keep take the disc out and put it back in order for my player to get it to play. About  a month after that, I had to do this anywhere form 3-5x to get the disc to play and now it simply won't play at all. Also of note, my first set came broken (the case and the mechanism that flips the DVDs inside the case), so that was also disappointing. This is my second set. 5 stars for the movies themselves, but for the other inconveniences, 3 stars; 3.5 if I could overall.",1501891200,,602,3.975206611570248
