8748718,5,B01AWXPGR6,"This appears to be the only Blu-Ray, Region A disc (currrently available and playable in the U.S.) of the longer Chinese release version film.  I had rented a DVD of this film (the shorter U.S.-release version) more than a year ago. This Blu-Ray version is longer (about 125 minutes, excluding the closing credits), and it pretty much matches in length the 130-minute running time that film critics mentioned with respect to the original foreign version.  The story line is more intelligible here.  The packaging is bare-bones (mostly in Chinese front and back), but the transfer of this gorgeous film is excellent.  Chinese dialogue, with English subtitles throughout, except during the opening and closing credits, where there are no subtitles.  I have many DVDs of other Wong Kar-Wai films, and this is a welcome addition.",1498435200,2,825,5.126865671641791
