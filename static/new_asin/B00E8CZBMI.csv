Did some research to later find out that DVDs are different across the Atlantic and I have the wrong one for the U.S. Oh well. Still a great show!",1499558400,,322,4.126984126984127

8602421,5,B00E8CZBMI,"This is the only Blu-ray version of Creepshow that has all new special features

Warner bros Blu-ray version is crap cause there is no extras all but may have a new HD transfer

this special edition of Creepshow was first released as 2 Disc DVD by Universal U.K. about 6 years ago now
Second sight has released CREEPSHOW with all new HD transfer
plus has the 90mins making of Documentary JUST DESERTS
interviews with George Romero, Tom savini and other cast and crew
incredible Doco which covers the script, cast, filming, editing, Music score, special effects make up
plus there's also 30mins behind the scenes footage from Tom savini's private Home collection
plus there's Deleted scenes from the workprint version
there's also still Gallery, Tv spots, Theatrical trailer
and the old DVD Audio commentary from the 2 Disc dvd set

Second sight have given a new 1:85:1 HD transfer & a new 5.1 Master audio mix
so definitely better version than the U.S. Warner bros blu-ray
this second sight's version is region B locked so you'll need all regions player
Second sight gave Creepshow lots of respect 5 star rating definitely worth the cash",1385769600,9,1137,4.850515463917525
