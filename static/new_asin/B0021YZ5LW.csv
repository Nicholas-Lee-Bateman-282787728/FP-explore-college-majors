I also love that he was a student of Joseph Pilates himself so it's not watered down, so-to-speak.",1518048000,,260,4.326530612244898
8349569,1,B0021YZ5LW,"I ordered this from this provider because it was stated to be new and still in the wrapper.  When I opened the wrapper the CD had straches on it.  It obviously was not new, but just rewrapped.  Very disappointed.",1402444800,,212,4.384615384615385

8349571,5,B0021YZ5LW,"I had this as part of the Body Victory program a few years ago and it changed my life. I always eat organic now and I feel great. This work out is not hard, especially if you're just starting to work out again, and it's a great start. It seem so easy, but I remember when I did this video every day and my body looked great. People would complement me on my arms and tell me how much I shaped up after a few months of using it. I lost the video because it got thown out in a jammed, old dvd player. But now I have it again and I will go back to working out with it every day. The results are awesome.",1284249600,2,600,3.7698412698412698
