At an early age, Kim sought to receive, recognize and develop her unique gifts from God.  She shows us what is possible when we believe, care, make wise choices and remain committed.

Recognizing we each have a unique purpose, this is a great example, as we develop our gifts, support and share with others, as only we each are able.  Thank you Kim, from the bottom of my Heart.",1324080000,3,611,4.324561403508772
