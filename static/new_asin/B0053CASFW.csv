8455142,4,B0053CASFW,"To someone who understands Spanish well enough these editions of Almodovar's films are a boon. In the case of Mujeres, the widescreen version on DVD with English subtitles does not allow the viewing of the entire image as shown in the theaters. In addition, these editions have excellent Spanish subtitles, so that if you need a little help in understanding the Spanish you can read the subtitles. English subtitles can give you a general idea of what's being said but they can't help you actually know what words are being used. For that, an edition like this is essential, provided you have enough Spanish to basically follow the actor's dialogue. In addition you have crisp Blu-ray to watch the films.",1449187200,,704,4.875
