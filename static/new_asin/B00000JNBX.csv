1235117,4,B00000JNBX,"norman reedus is very good I enjoy his films. Isaac hayes was cool in the film playing a corrupt cop. it is a strange movie. norman reedus is dominated by his mother. Debbie harry. he has a split personality, alter ego. that he talks with similar to fight club.  a bad v good creepy story. worth a look see",1402876800,2,306,4.186440677966102
1235118,5,B00000JNBX,"Came SUPER fast, like within three days ven though it was scheduled to come a little less than a month after I ordered it. AMAZING quality, it was perfect, disc was perfect, everything was.

I love Norman Reedus, and had never seen this movie, so I ordered this, and it was more than I expected it to be!
The movie is VERY confusing, but really entertaining, and I loved it.
Great addition o a movie collection. :)

There is quite a lot of sex/romance scenes, and sex talk is not uncommon.
Violence is very frequent, and quite gruesome.
Language is very frequent, like a LOT of swearing.

I recommend NOT seeing the movie if you are under about 15. Of course, you know your kids, and this is a rated R movie, so, you decide.",1382918400,,724,4.348148148148148
1235119,1,B00000JNBX,"I love Norman Reedus, especially when he is portraying Daryl Dixon on the Walking Dead. I really did not like this movie. All I'm going to say is that it was really creepy and strange.",1379721600,,184,4.285714285714286
1235120,5,B00000JNBX,"Movie is great no complaints I am 100% satisfied! Even though it was useed you would never be able to tell, no scratches either =)",1376524800,,130,4.24
1235121,5,B00000JNBX,"I enjoyed this and I cared about the main character.  I don't always, sometimes I am like go ahead loose ya big looser.  Not this time.  there is also a good twist in this one and I do like surprises.",1373932800,,200,3.95
1235122,5,B00000JNBX,"Love Norman Reedus. Debra Harry does a good job of being the uncomfortably over bearing mother. Dark, funny, violent, quirky movie.",1368921600,,131,5.285714285714286
1235123,5,B00000JNBX,"Perfectly cast, excellently acted, disturbing look into the lives of a few people that are probably more commonplace than anyone would like to know about!",1364169600,,154,5.2
1235124,4,B00000JNBX,"I bought this movie because I am a Norman Reedus fan.  It is a B movie, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.  Norman Reedus does a good job and makes most movies well worth watching.",1324166400,,175,4.117647058823529
1235125,4,B00000JNBX,"Anyone complaining of the bad ending of the movie, should really try reading the book, Portrait of a Young Man Drowning, on which it was based. It's actually very well done, if you've read the book.",1294531200,,198,4.527777777777778
1235126,5,B00000JNBX,"I love the roles that Norman Reedus chooses for himself, they are quirky, dark and sometimes even charming and funny. All of which you find in this film. The acting of the others only made this DVD more enjoyable for me. Debbie Harry was a great sick little mommy, and she can still sings.
If you enjoy crime dramas with a touch of thriller, and a dash of dark comdey (only a dash) you will love this film.
Is a great addition to my Norman Reedus shelf. Someday I hope that Norman will choose a comedy film to make, he is a well rounded actor. Comedy and a bit of romance for Norman would make him perfect in my eyes.",1273708800,,617,4.15
1235127,5,B00000JNBX,"This movie is the epitome of an independent film; it has a little bit of everything. At times, it's funny. Other times, it's a little bit odd. But one thing's for sure, Norman Reedus is a star in this film!

He's a fabulous actor who can mold to any role he's given, and that's evident in this black comedy that covers everything from incest to the mob. It's an older film, but will remain one of my favorites for a long time to come.

As some final words of wisdom, if you like ""Six Ways to Sunday"", I would definitely recommend checking out&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Beatnicks/dp/B001BEJ4J2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Beatnicks</a>. It has the same dark, gritty feel and is sure to entertain those who enjoy independent cinema.",1269216000,,786,5.330645161290323
1235128,5,B00000JNBX,"It's one of the the most messed up, but amazing movies I have ever seen. You have to have a taste for its sort of dark humor to find it funny, but if you think you do, and you love Norman Reedus, then this is the movie for you.",1255219200,,227,3.6530612244897958
1235129,5,B00000JNBX,"I really liked this movie. The acting was terrific. It may not be for all, but I loved how dark the movie was.",1238371200,,110,3.8260869565217392
1235130,5,B00000JNBX,"I admit, I only originally watched this movie for the actors in it, but as I was watching it, I felt myself intrigued by the strange, yet sick, bond between a mother and her son. The movie itself can, at times, lack slightly in story line, but the overall effect it has will leave any person thinking. Debbie Harry and Norman Reedus both have memorable, and at times haunting, performances that make the movie what it is. I would say this is a must see movie.",1163635200,3,459,4.348837209302325
1235131,5,B00000JNBX,"It's great to see such a rich, quirky story hit the big screen. I wasn't expecting its charms and was surprised by Deborah Harry's excellent performance. Adrien Brody is wonderful, as usual. I recommend this movie to anybody looking for an offbeat way to spend an afternoon.",1153699200,,274,4.851063829787234
1235132,4,B00000JNBX,"I never saw the movie before I bought it, all I knew that Norman Reedus was in it and that I loved him in Boondock Saints and Blade II.

The people are wonderfully cast ~ not only Norman Reedus, but Deborah Harry as Harry's mother is a quirky Jewish mother and Adrien Brody is a wanna-be gangster to the point of ridiculousness. I loved Elina Lowensohn in the part as Iris.

It's a decidedly twisted combination of Jewish mob, Ohio, and a mama's boy...Very strange, but in this case it works ~ in an unusual way.",1108339200,5,512,4.322916666666667
1235133,4,B00000JNBX,"Charming may be an odd word to use to describe a thriller, but it fits in this case.  This is a completely unique entry in the thriller category, effortlessly fusing the Jewish mob, Youngstown Ohio, and a mama's boy.  Yes, a decidedly odd combination, but it works exceptionally well, thanks to intelligent writing and fine acting.
Harry Odum lives with his mother who dotes on him beyond the point of normalcy.  Hence, Harry is seriously conflicted about the opposite sex and, as well, easily provoked into bouts of raging violence.  This last quality proves to be an asset as a Jewish mob underling, Abie Pinkwise, hears of Harry's gifts which have been applied, quite diligently, to a strip club owner.
Harry's quickly recruited as muscle for Louis Varga who, in spite of his last name, is Jewish to the point of reveling in a typical meal--gefilte fish (""Jewish hamburger"" he calls it), horseradish, matzoh, and the works--which he invites Harry, a goy (non-Jew), to participate in along with Louis' crew, all members of the tribe.  Harry's good at his job--waxing (perhaps the Youngstown Ohio Jewish mob version of ""whacking"")--and so is soon rolling in dough, enough to buy a new house for him and his Mom.
As Mrs. Odum, Debbie Harry is spot on.  She's an excellent actress given the right parts, and this is definitely one of the best parts she's done in a film.  The Oedipal attachment she forces on Harry is so strong that near the end of the film, the inevitable happens (you can guess what that is), resulting in tragedy that nevertheless produces a malicious grin. This strong black comedy component of the film, then, is like fusing Bruce Jay Friedman's ""A Mother's Kisses"" or Dan Greenburg's ""How to Be a Jewish Mother"" with the Godfather.  Except Harry himself is not Jewish, even though his mother is a Jewish mother to the max.
Harry meets Iris, a Hungarian emigre girl who eventually captures his confused heart.  Elina Lowinsohn is perfect in this role, as is Isaac Hayes as a corrupt cop (a lotta self-respecting crime films have one of these, right?), Adrien Brody as a wanna-be gangster who emulates urban culture to the point of near-ridiculousness, and Norman Reedus as our hero Harry.  The nicely juxtaposed opposites of deep down innocence (in Harry) and vicious brutality work well when combined with Iris' radiant simplicity, generating the charming element of the film.
A constantly broken chair and Mrs. Odum's other homey quirks supplies much of the humor here, but there is some grim stuff too.  This is a quirky film that never really got its due and should be seen by many more people.
Recommended.",1074384000,24,2632,4.839643652561247
1235134,5,B00000JNBX,"Norman Reedus has to be perhaps one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. From starring roles in the Boondock Saints and minor roles in films like 8mm, he came into his own with this film. Adrien Brody as a wannabe gangster, obviously before playing Vladyslaw and Isaac Hayes in a great cameo...you are shown a twisted tale of mother/son bonding and a blossoming relationship between two young adults with a commonality in their desire for one another. Plenty of violence to consume that crowd...a dark comedy at its finest.",1067644800,13,530,4.9
1235144,3,B00000JNBX,"i hadn't seen this movie before when i decided to buy it, but adrien brody was in it and i've enjoyed all the movies i've seen with him. i have to say his acting in this was so convincing i had to laugh because his character reminded me of someone i knew. i couldn't even reconize adrien's personality while he played this strange character. the reason i only gave it three stars was because it was unneccessarily vivid in its violence and the plot didn't need to be that disguisting, especially the end. it seemed like the writer and director were trying too hard to get a rise out of people. i give adrien's performance five stars, but the movie just leaves you upset with the disturbing ending.",1058918400,7,697,4.453125
1235145,1,B00000JNBX,"This is easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Not because it is (supposedly) ""disturbing"" or ""controversial""...there's nothing new here in that respect...but because it is a poorly written, filmed and acted piece of garbage. Don't waste time of money.",1043798400,2,262,5.116279069767442
1235146,5,B00000JNBX,"I must say that I bought this movie only because Deborah Harry was in it. I was completelly blown away by her performance. She is an ICON and she knows it. You almost will not recognize her in this role.  The directing was tight, story was excellent, acting was super. The ending is MORE than disturbing. There is one scene with Deborah that makes the film worth it's price, it involves Deborah doing a campy version of Andrea True Connection's ""More More More"". Just buy it!",986601600,2,475,4.523255813953488
1235147,5,B00000JNBX,"The main privilege of the low-budget filmmaking is not having to carry the crashing load of responsibility to everyone for everything. And a director can go several ways from here. He/she can indulge him(her)self in the weird self-expression, giving his/her ""insights"" the value they do not actually have. Or - just like Mr. Bernstein did - make something uncaringly original, captivating from the first frame to the last. Yes, he uses the ex-pop icon and the male model and their relations are recognizably Psycho, he puts Jewinsh mobsters in his film, he is pop-violent and anashamedly sentimental, he can be accused of borrowing and quoting heavily from different sources.
But somehow I feel he is innocent of all the charges that can be made against him. Adam Bernstein helms his film with a steady and assured hand. In our postmodern time he just ignores the dominating trend to disassemble any work of art to see where it's components came from, where they were originally concieved for the first time - if there is such a thing as the first time.
If he feels the sitation calls for such and such words and actions - he puts them in disregarding any similarities. There is a lot of violence but it's evidently not gratuitous - and that's refreshing.
What I see in this film is an effort of a very mature director to  make the movies the way he likes and can. His place on the map is not huge and overflowing  but it's very definite.",983923200,11,1438,4.65748031496063
1235148,5,B00000JNBX,"Honestly, I had no idea what to expect. And this film had me delightfully wondering just that throughout. A bunch of bizzare fun! Ms. Harry proves she's multi-talented, and very weird!",960854400,,184,4.967741935483871
1235149,5,B00000JNBX,"I have never been more shocked and delighted by one movie. ""Six ways"" is simply a perfect movie, the acting is great, the plot, the action, and the way the movie just flows. Debbie Harry and Norman Reedus  make a perfect mother/son duo and their dialogue is scary yet entertaining.  The movie borrows aspects from such classics as ""Psycho"" and  ""Goodfellas"" but is original enough to be a classic on its own.  This movie has everything that you could possibly want from a movie:  violence, freaky sex, and great performances. If you haven't seen it you  don't know what you're in for when you do!",945216000,17,596,4.628571428571429

If you haven't read Portrait of a Young Man Drowning, I recommend watching this movie, I'm sure you'll like it.
If you have read the book, I wouldn't recommend watching it. I can guarantee you'll be greatly disappointed - unless you just want to watch it to get your Norman Reedus fix ",1485561600,3,547,4.362745098039215
