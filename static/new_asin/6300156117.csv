I am now on the hunt for the counting video I believe was made using the same animal exercising format. Any help is greatly appreciated!!!,1453075200,,272,4.150943396226415

I have spent the last month trying to remember the name of this so I can order it for my chubby 7 year old.  She'll love this video!  I'm excited, thank goodness for curtains, but now it'll be the temptation NOT to dance to this while they are at school",1428883200,3,416,4.024390243902439

My personal favorite was the elephant song (Run and run, and run and run, and POUND POUND POUND!) Need your kids to burn off some energy right before a nap- here's the way to go.",1238889600,6,304,3.9193548387096775
