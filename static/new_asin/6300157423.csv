This Video is in fact a kids humorous instructional tape on how to do gags and party tricks.  It is from 1986, so the hair and wardrobe alone makes this tape comic gold. It is hosted by a young Malcom Jamal Warner (Cosby Show) and Features the likes or Fred Newman, Madman Magician Friedhoffer (who uses this strange Hasidic Jewish accent that doesn't fit his character at all) and comedian Frankie Pace. Learn how to do the Hawaiian nose hum and beatbox at the same time! Learn how to levitate, and how to juggle.

Well worth watching for the over-acting, atrociously dated computer graphics and stage props, the acid wash jeans, and the obnoxiously catchy synth theme
