7919932,3,B00004CTC8,"1.) The Body Donnas vs The Smoking Gunns w/Sunny

The PPV opens with a decent Tag Team match between the Body Donnas and the Tag Team Champions, The Gunns. Only thing was, the titles weren't on the line. The Gunns botch a double team move midway through and try to play it off but fail at it. Skip missile dropkicks Bart and Zip makes the pin for the win

2.) Mankind vs Henry Godwinn w/Hillbilly Jim

Mankind was originally supposed to fight Jake the Snake Roberts but was replaced by Henry Godwinn. A dull filler match that sees Mankind get the KO win after applying the Mandible Claw to Godwinn

3.) Stone Cold Steve Austin vs Marc Mero w/Sable

Great match put forth from these two. Loved the action and everything about the match. It's kind of weird seeing how differently Steve Austin competed in the ring, prior to his career threatening injury in 1997. Austin wins this excellent back and forth match with a Stunner on Mero for the win

4.) Goldust w/Marlena vs The Undertaker w/Paul Bearer

In a rematch from their previous In Your House bout, Undertaker and Goldust went at it again in this awesome and aggressive rematch. The Undertaker and Goldust go back and forth and even use the steel steps a few times throughout the match as a weapon. Mankind interferes at the end and drags Taker down to the bottom of the ring, but it's only a matter of time before Undertaker rises and brawls with Mankind to the the boiler room. A nice ending to one of the most underrated feuds of the 90s and the beginning of the amazing Undertaker/Mankind feud

5.) Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson, and Sycho Sid vs Camp Cornette (Owen Hart, British Bulldog, and Vader) w/Jim Cornette

The basis of this storyline was that after Ultimate Warrior had been suspended due to no-showing several WWF house show events, Michaels and Ahmed needed to find a replacement. Michaels found an ally in Sycho Sid who he had bailed out of the mental institution (kayfabe). In reality, Ultimate Warrior quit WWF after heated backstage disputes with Vince McMahon and they replaced Warrior with Sid, who had been out healing an injury since December 1995. The match itself was a fun one and I love watching it every time. The match gets plenty of time and it gives way for a lot of exciting fast paced action to go down in the ring. Vader gets the win with a Vader Bomb on Michaels but man oh man is this is a match to watch! Sycho Sid even got a great babyface pop, which started his high success as a babyface for the WWF. Great main event!

Overall: Decent PPV. Not a lot of great matches on the card though. Many In Your House PPVs suffered from this though. The match to watch is the main event. You'll love every bit of it! This was Sycho Sid's first match as a babyface and man did he perform well as the face. Even the fans loved him, which was a bit surprising, considering he'd only been back for about 2 weeks prior to the PPV. But Sid was without a doubt a better face than a heel. Overall, I'd only watch this PPV for the main event and maybe the Goldust vs The Undertaker encounter. Everything else is skip worthy",1405209600,,3511,5.126094570928196
7919933,3,B00004CTC8,"Once again, thanks to WWE Classics On Demand (and do to the whole ""Global Warning"" month), I was able to relive another of the original In Your House events titled ""International Incident"". There were many feuds starting up here with the biggest ones standing out being the WWF Champion Shawn Michaels dealing with Vader while Undertaker & Mankind really brought their feud to a fever pitch.

The Smoking Gunns vs The Body Donnas. This was a rematch from the Royal Rumble earlier in the year with the difference being that this was a non-title match & that both teams have switched roles (with Sunny being in the Gunns' corner). But unlike their Rumble match, both teams were ""off"" & didn't click as well as their previous match with the only notable issue being the beginning of Billy Gunn focusing more on Sunny than the actual match being a factor.

Mankind vs Henry Godwinn. The story behind this match was that Mankind was supposed to face Jake Roberts but he didn't show up & was replaced by Henry Godwinn (keep listening to the King's comments towards that subject). Besides that this was just a filler match that was kinda dull & pointless since this was not a feud & most of the focus was towards Lawler's feud with Jake & Mankind's feud with Undertaker.

Stone Cold Steve Austin vs ""Wildman"" Marc Mero. Another rematch except this time, this was a rematch from their KOTR Semi Final match where Austin got his top lip busted open so bad to the point where he went to the hospital to get it closed up. And just like that match, this was a solid encounter that went back & forth with the story of Mero making one mistake that cost him the match adding to it.

The Undertaker vs Goldust. I guess this is the event for rematches as this was a rematch from their Beware of Dog Casket match (which was the previous In Your House). Both men were more aggressive here than their previous encounter with the steel steps being used at times including Taker chokeslamming Goldust onto the steps. However, the bigger issue here was Mankind coming from the ""depths of hell"" to attack Taker only for Taker to return the favor that lead to a brawl back to the backstage area & even to the boiler room. This did a good job in pushing the Taker/Mankind for SummerSlam but also, another solid encounter between these two.

Shawn Michaels, Ahmed Johnson & Sycho Sid vs Vader, Owen Hart & British Bulldog.  This match had many stories being told as this was the return to in-ring action for Sycho Sid (who got the loudest pop of the night by the way) since the KOTR '95 while Jim Cornette had promised that if his team didn't win, he would refund the PPV audience but also, pay close attention to HBK's entrance as the audience just wanted to get a piece of Shawn. This was a fun match to watch as everyone put on a good showing with moments like the confrontation between Sid & Vader, HBK being the quickest person in the match with his high-flying offense while Owen & Bulldog showed signs of their future success as a tag team. However, the bigger story being told was what happened with Cornette & Jose Lothario that had Vader take advantage of an opportunity & ended up pinning Shawn to set up their title match at SummerSlam.

Overall, there was only one match on the card that was worth going out of your way to see while the rest of the card were rematches but only two (Taker/Goldust, Austin/Mero) stood out but you can find their better matches elsewhere so this is one I'd recommend cheap or pass as I have it at a 2.5 but bumped up to 3.",1266710400,2,3539,4.477519379844961
