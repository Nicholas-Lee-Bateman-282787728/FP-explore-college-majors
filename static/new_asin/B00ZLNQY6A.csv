8720510,1,B00ZLNQY6A,"Low budget, extremely weird French ""comedy"" set in Kabul, where the biggest problems they can come with are finding enough Booze to run a kind of crappy, low rent Casablanca...it's horrendous.",1524873600,,192,5.225806451612903
8720511,5,B00ZLNQY6A,"This is my favorite TV series of all time -- police procedural, foreign atmosphere, colorful characters -- and it's French! Looks like the Euro Zone had learned about HBO & SHOWTIME drama and comedy and placed their own imprint on it.",1519862400,,234,4.7317073170731705
8720512,5,B00ZLNQY6A,"It's very, very interesting. It shows a story that seems true and fiction, serious and hilarious all the time. It reminds me some of the french actor Alain Delon movies. I love the hilarious and the serious things of being a restaurant owner in a muslim country: the cultural differences. Sometimes you don't know if the police will be friendly or not, if the Afghanistan people will be okay with lots of the westerners there... I love to watch it and the Season 2 either.",1458604800,,472,4.564705882352941
8720513,4,B00ZLNQY6A,"This is a French comedy with English subtitles and I found it pretty damn good. Lately I haven't found much to enjoy on TV and as someone who watches very little TV it needs to be worth it.

It took me about 15 minutes to get into it but when I did, I enjoyed the characters and had to keep reminding myself this was a TV show with episodes not a movie.

The setting and acting was great.

Based loosely on a true story journalist Marc Victor, who owned a restaurant for French expatriates in Kabul the movie is a interesting premise of a money hungry man and his humanitarian daughter.

I love the actress who plays Sophie. She is here to stay whether her pop likes it or not. She is definitely a force to be reckoned with.

While I have yet to see how this is a comedy unless it it so because we see the Taliban swimming and sipping their drinks instead of carrying a gun, I would never have put it in that category.

It is a drama and well done if you can get past the subtitles, I know many who can't but I like it. Not sure if I will follow Season 2 but I have thought about the series a couple of times since the last episode so only time will tell.",1441152000,3,1155,4.021834061135372
