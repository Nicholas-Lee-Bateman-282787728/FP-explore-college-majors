I wish I could return this. Extremely disappointed! Save your hard earned cash......",1373328000,13,247,5.358974358974359

Both of the disks in this set are already available on amazon:

The video is poor quality and obviously thrown together. It looks like a collection of clips someone downloaded from the Internet.  They didn't even bother to assemble the clips in any kind of chronological or logical order. Don't expect any concert footage
