8437258,4,B004OOSEJ2,"CFA would get 5 stars in my opinion if only the Dvds weren't so pricy. Sammy Franco and friends are quite good at teaching  and there is a lot of great techniques that in my past martial arts training lacked. Also like to mention that it would be excellent if one could choose ""which"" set of 4 Dvds came in the box for the special discount price. I just ordered Dvds from different categories so I mixed and matched and ordered the ones I wanted but at the full price per unit. Another plus is that Franco's people in shippiing and handling are quite proficient. Hey Franco real good stuff man but lower your prices more often with more frequent specials, ok thanx, chouu. P.S. This review is actually for the order I received 5/17/12 (yesterday) where I paid full price for each unit. But in all the confusion this review got attached with an order I placed last April which was a discounted sale of 4 Dvds for the price of three, sorry my bad.",1337212800,,945,4.369318181818182
