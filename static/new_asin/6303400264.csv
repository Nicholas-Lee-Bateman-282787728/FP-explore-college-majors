I recently watched it and found this episode of this cult classic series to be a great companion to anyone's library of ghost phenomena. Although it's style is classically sci-fi campy, there's a refreshing look about it when set against the fast-paced world we see on TV now. After all, there are no computers around like we've got now to fake the pictures seen in this show, so I got to see photos and testimony as real as it probably gets. I highly recommend this program for those who want to delve into the mysteries of the where and why--a romantic perspective. A more scientific perspective will have to be found elsewhere for those wonks who really want to split hairs. A good show to see on Halloween night as well!",1392854400,,783,4.6

For anyone with even a rudimentary understanding of the subject, this video has nothing to offer.",1168041600,,280,4.714285714285714
