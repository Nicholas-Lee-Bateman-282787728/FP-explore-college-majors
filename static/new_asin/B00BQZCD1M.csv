8572956,4,B00BQZCD1M,"I was looking to try and configure P90X and Insanity into a golf specific workout.  Kai's solution works perfectly by basically giving you 3 lifting workouts a week, and then you can subsitute in the other days with the BeachBody products for cardio, core or yoga.  You can watch the DVD once or twice, take some notes on the guide, then do it on your own without the DVD.  If you are already fit, I think the instructions that you should do Phase I and II for 9 weeks is way too long, especially if you believe in P90X's muscle confusion theory.  Don't be a slave to it, mix it up, good results will come.",1369267200,4,606,4.243478260869566
