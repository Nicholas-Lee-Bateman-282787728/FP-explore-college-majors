8120747,5,B000FC2HPY,Lots of information on the artists and their lives. 300 minutes of video on 6 DVDs. Thoroughly enjoyable and informative!,1339286400,,121,5.1
8120748,5,B000FC2HPY,"The value of the set is in its systematic approach to the subject. If you have genuine interest in history  of impressionism this set will definitely provide. My only grudge that I wanted some entertainment and not mentoring.
If you like it my way check&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Impressionists-Art-Galleries-and-Music-of-the-Time-2DVDs-3CDs-Ultimate-MosaicDVD-Collection/dp/B001EUFYBK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Impressionists Art Galleries and Music of the Time, 2DVDs+3CDs Ultimate MosaicDVD Collection</a>&nbsp;and it is superior in image quality.
The set is nice if you are looking for methodical exploration of arts. If you are looking for an educated entertainment and excitement look the other way.",1219795200,2,755,7.206521739130435
8120749,4,B000FC2HPY,"I really enjoyed this set along with a bunch of friends of mine. it had a lot of information to learn from and the packaging was attractive. I also gave this set as a gift to someone in my family and they loved it. i can admit it's not perfect, no program ever is. and nobody else offers such great and diverse content. Kultur, I'm glad I found you.",1158537600,6,349,4.072463768115942
8120750,2,B000FC2HPY,"Kultur has a whole lot of fine titles in their collections.  Content wise - they give a good though superficial survey of their subjects, but their production values are in the sewer.  I keep ordering and I keep getting stung.  The NYC Tabloids have a better printing production record than that which is issued in Kultur's ART SERIES.  Come on DVD is supposed to be sharp and crisp.  The Post-impressionists follows the poor reproduction in The Impressionists which follows the poor reproduction in The Dutch Masters, which follows The Landmarks of Western Art.  Do you get the picture?  I wish Kultur would GET THE PICTURE and then give us a quality DVD reproduction of the world great art.",1157155200,17,692,4.813559322033898
