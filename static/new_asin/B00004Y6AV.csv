1371219,1,B00004Y6AV,"Yes, I did manage to watch about half of this nonsense.
My main idea was to see this chick Melanie in her younger years but I didn't realize mainstream propaganda took over.
Violence in movie is quite high considering government, media and all other means of oppession tell us every day we are  apex of Western civilization and, accordingly, of all world. I don't think so! We are at the bottom more likely.
Buying this flick was one of many of my mistakes.
Not like I didn't know there is unwritten law to show violence so we don't have time to think, it reminded me even bigger nonsense in Scary movies. Hmm, first we glorify violence, then we surprized we see it in real life, then we create laws to surpress violence, then we couldn't stop and never will till we collapse as society.",1328054400,,787,4.465277777777778
1371220,1,B00004Y6AV,"I ordered CD Fear City.  I really like the movie.  However, on second viewing, midway through the CD, the screen scrambled the picture.  It did not work.  I got only half of a movie that played correctly.  I am very disappointed in the inferior quality of the CD.  I payed $50.00 for it.",1293148800,,287,4.320754716981132
1371221,5,B00004Y6AV,"This movie is about the sleaze of New York City in Times Square in the early eighties! It has everything from strip clubs to lesbians to drug addiction and... murder! A crazed psychopath is out slashing, and kiling, strippers. Other strippers, start quitting out of the fear of being his next victim, and this makes their agents Tom Berenger and Jack Scalia lose business so they want this guy caught! Berenger's bisexual ex-girlfriend, who he still loves, Melanie griffith has a drug problem which becomes fatal. Billy de Williams is a cop trying to catch the psycho who's been butchering a number of strippers already. When the killer almost kills Berenger's best friend and starts to go after his ex, its up to him to stop the psycho before he strikes again. Great cast and excellent atmosphere for this sleazy thriller/ melodrama! Supporting Cast includes Rae Dawn Chong( Commando, the Color Purple), Janet Julian(Humongous),Maria Chonchita Alonso(Vampire's kiss, Predator 2),Rossano Brazzi( South Pacific) and was directed by the infamous director Abel Ferrara who directed Body Snatchers(1993), Dangerous Game(1993), Bad Lieutenant(1992), King of New York(1990), Ms. 45(1981), and The Driller Killer(1979).One of the best thrillers of the80s is highly underated and highly recommended!!!!",1281312000,9,1294,5.442786069651741
1371222,2,B00004Y6AV,"I can only judge this film by the USA version of the DVD, which is what I viewed.
I didn't like it very much. I understand that it was meant to portray a somewhat tawdry lifestyle of strippers in the seedy part of NYC, but this film didn't hold together that well, despite the presence of a first-rate cast.
The nudity (mostly strippers doing their dance routines) made me yawn after a while. I expected some nudity in this movie, and nudity doesn't offend me (I've drawn many nudes in Life Drawing class!). But I thought the dance sequences got to be too long and derivative. Obviously everyone else's mileage will vary on this point, and I guess the fact that I am female is not insignificant in explaining my sentiments.
Jack Scalia, Tom Berenger, Billy Dee Williams and Melanie Griffith are the main stars. Griffith's performance is kind of lackluster, but I don't recall her maturing too much as an actress until much later. (This film was made in 1984.) Tom Berenger is good as the brooding ex-boxer sporting a head full of curls. (Oh my word -- the clothing and hair in this movie were *so* '80s!) Jack Scalia is handsome, square-jawed and likeable in his part, as is Billy Dee Williams, (though I didn't think his character was written very well).
I didn't understand why the story was written the way it was -- why is there so little mystery? We know who the killer is right off. What motivates him to kill? I never did find that out -- maybe I dozed off and missed that bit of information when I was bored into a stupor during one of the topless dancing routines. Whatever. All I know is, the story could have, and *should* have been much more interesting.
This is the first movie I've seen of director Abel Farrara, and I don't believe it is a proper introduction to his work. I have been led to believe that he has made some notable films. This is not one of them. The plot is average, the pace is choppy, and I disliked the score immensely. It was intrusive and hackneyed.
This is an average film. If you like any of the main stars and don't mind the seamy smarminess of the story then you might want to view this film. Otherwise, I am guessing that one of the other films by Farrara would be a better choice.",1040947200,2,2222,4.408759124087592
1371223,4,B00004Y6AV,"I've had this movie for years, back to when I foolishly wasted my money on a laser disk player.  But, anyway.  The plot of this movie is simple: a psycho has targeted a group of strippers, for his own warped reasons, for death. And of course, we, the audience, get to see the acts of most of the dancers, before their timed-just-right deaths.  Rae Dawn Chong and  Melanie Griffith, for two.  What is there to say about a movie like this?  A must see for fans of Abel Ferarra.",996105600,,475,4.280898876404494
1371224,4,B00004Y6AV,In response to the review written on 31/03/01- the film was cut by the BBFC (British Board of Film Classification) of a total of 1 minute and 10 seconds!  This is probably the most edited anywhere.  The version on ... UK website is 91 minutes in length; the version on the German website is 93 minutes; the version on this / the US website is 95 minutes in length.  One can only assume that an edited version was submitted to the British censor prior to their 1 minute and 10 seconds of cuts.,990403200,4,492,4.268817204301075
1371225,5,B00004Y6AV,"This has been one of my favorite movies for years.  I owned an early VHS copy, which had none of the quality or editing issues others report.  I haven't had a playback machine for years, and just do On Demand.  But, I recently got the Amazon Fire TV stick, and started looking for some of the movies I really loved, but can never find on Cable (like Strictly Ballroom and The Final Countdown).  How thrilling to find them available!  I can't wait to watch this again, and sincerely hope it isn't edited.  After watching the wonderful Amazon Bosch series, with at least an f-word a minute, I'm hopeful they didn't bother to cut anything from this movie. (And come to think of it, Down Dog had tons of sex scenes.) Fear City might be sleazy, but it's also uplifting, and it stuck with me.  Tom Berenger at his best.  Melanie Griffith was awesome, as were all the supporting cast members, many of whom you will recognize.  Never understood why this movie wasn't well known.",978307200,,970,4.528735632183908
7926657,3,B00004Y6AV,"Shout factory have reissued Abel Ferrara's lost classic FEAR CITY on blu-ray
with a screen ratio of 1:66:1  so there's 1inch black pillars showing on either side of the screen
for some reason shout factory didn't widen the ratio to 1:85:1, the old Anchor bay dvd is 1:85:1 ratio
plus the original Theatrical trailer as an extra
Shout factory have added both the Theatrical cut 95min & Unrated cut 97min in the same 1:66:1 ratio
plus a new 2.0 master audio mix only, not 5.1 master mix which would've been better sounding
but tragically no new extras not even the original trailer has been added
it would've been Great to have new interview with Abel Ferrara or new audio commentary by Abel
maybe he Declined to be interviewed
if you have the old Anchor bay dvd, keep it if you want the film in 1:85:1 ratio and also prefer the Unrated cut
otherwise this new blu-ray reissue is only in 1:66:1 ratio and you get both versions of the film
about 3 stars i give this new blu-ray reissue",1494028800,,981,4.4804469273743015
7926658,4,B00004Y6AV,"Blu Ray: 3/5
Movie: 4/5

Blu-Ray: All you get is the option to either watch the movie R-Rated or Unrated. In the Unrated version the deleted scenes are implemented into the R-Rated making for inconsistency in picture quality. The deleted aspects are darker in tone and at time jagged in motion as the regular scenes are in good condition. Somewhat intolerable but I was overall fine with it.

Movie: The reason why I liked this movie is because of the kung fu serial killer. Odd, but I enjoy this concept. The overall film may not stimulate you with thought provoking bull$#!+ but it's entertainment value in terms of exploitative content is wonderful. It's more-so a serial killer thriller but it does have some martial arts action as well.",1471996800,3,741,4.78125

7926660,1,B00004Y6AV,I've been fooled. This movier was never transferred properly on a Blu-Ray. The quality of the movie is terrible. Do not buy this DVD.,1389398400,,133,4.583333333333333
7926661,3,B00004Y6AV,"I like much of Abel Ferrara's work. This is one of his earlier works and much of what made him a director to see is not happening here.

Here's the scoop. Ex-boxer Matt Rossi (Tom Berenger with really bad hair, and his bud Nick Parzeno (Jack Scalia) run an agency hiring out girls to strip clubs, private parties, etc. Suddenly, the girls from their agency are targeted by a psycho killer and the terror he causes makes everything they had head south. Matt's main squeeze (Melanie Griffith) takes all this so hard she heads back to doing the hard stuff. Add detective Earl Wheeler (Billy Dee Williams), who'd bust them for bad breath if he could, and it all starts to crumble.

Everything. All the little details that made ""King of New York"" such a great flick are absent here. Ferrara's long time screen writer, Nicholas St. John, must have been still finding his way. This is loaded with really stupid stuff. For instance: Why is Williams questioning Matt on the attack of one of his dancers? He wasn't there and has no motive. Why isn't he questioning her? And why is the killer working such a small herd. New York is huge. Why isn't he spreading it around? This kind of stupidity is replete throughout the film. So little of it makes sense. And would Matt really have a showdown with the killer in the end? What are the chances?

I don't want to come down too hard on this because it IS an earlier effort from a director who went on to do greater works. But this fails at so many levels. Even the acting, by some of note, isn't all that good. The production values are decent enough given the content. The music is stuck in that time, and, like the movie itself, doesn't transcend that time.

If you're a fan of Ferrara's have at it. If not......",1386374400,,1750,4.442367601246106

7926663,4,B00004Y6AV,"I consider Tom Berenger an underrated actor who has had a number of good movie roles and performed well. This one involves an ex-boxer who is now a talent agent who provides young ladies for strip clubs and thus does include some partial nudity. This movie was made during the early days of the martial arts period (Chuck Norris, etc.) and involves a martial arts serial killer who murders young women. Intersting finale for those who have some interest in boxing versus martial art.",1377129600,,483,4.761904761904762
7926664,4,B00004Y6AV,"Fear City is the follow-up film to 1981's Ms. 45 and it's a pretty enjoyable movie. A ""kung fu slasher"" film starring Tom Berringer and Jack Scalia as owners of a temp agency for strippers. There is a karate serial killer running the streets slicing and murdering strippers on there way to and from their gigs, And Matt Rossi (Berringer) must stop him before the maniac kills his ex-girlfriend (Griffith). Billie Dee Williams plays Al Wheeler, a 42nd St. cop who doesn't like the cut of Berringer's jib. There is a sub-plot about Berringer being an ex-boxer who kills another man in the ring and possibly being connected to the local Mafia. This is a pretty solid movie for Abel Ferrara and one of my personal favorites, Rae Dawn Chong also has a cameo as ""Leila"" one of the karate killer's victims! Awesome!",1373500800,8,808,4.6573426573426575
7926665,2,B00004Y6AV,"The only thing to fear in ""Fear City"" is the fact that you've seen it all before and you're about to waste 96 minutes of your life seeing it again. This 1984 hybrid slasher/soft core porn flick boasts an impressive cast with some prominent actors at the start of their careers (Tom Berenger, Billy Dee Williams, Melanie Griffith) and some well established ones (Jan Murray, Rossano Brazzi) in the mix.

The film's director, Bronx born Abel Ferrara, is best known for his gritty films like ""Bad Lieutenant"" (1992) and ""King of New York"" (1990), both of which are similar to this film - set in New York, lots of crime, sex, and death. Think of this film as the tune up for the later films, which are considerably better, albeit no Oscar contenders. His long time collaborator, Nicholas St. John is credited as the writer, but one has to wonder if he is a real character or merely a nom d'plume for Ferrara himself.

Bottom line - give this one a miss.",1335916800,,949,4.511627906976744
7926666,5,B00004Y6AV,"Don't know what version these other poor buggers are complaining about.  I got the Anchor Bay version and it looks just fine and sounds fine.  This is a really curious explotation film with the cast involved: Tom Berrenger, Melanie Griffith, Billy Dee Williams, Jack Scalia, Rae Dawn Chong.  Interesting tale of stripper being attacked by a martial arts loon.  The finale is a fight to the death between him and Berrenger's ex-boxer.  Saw this film years ago on HBO and have been waiting years for it to turn up on DVD.  Was not disapointed.",1332374400,4,541,4.702127659574468
