7967033,4,B00006BSH8,"Big Hits Video is an odd compilation of videos from the late 1980's and early 1990's. Why is it odd? Because you may or may not have ever heard of the groups whose videos are presented here. You'll more than likely remember them once you hear them, but it's likely you be wondering when/where.

There's also an odd 1970's pre-MTV video in here: Taste of Honey's Boogie Oogie Oogie - kinda odd.....

One Hit Wonders: Tasmin Archer -Sleeping Satellite (awesome song and a great video)

Chesney Hawkes - great song even if by a pin up boy - the song was pinned by Nik Kershaw, a song writer of huge magnitude. And it's just a fun vid.

T'pau - don't remember the song, but ya gotta know the group was named after a Klingon from Star Trek.....nuf said?

Inner City - Good Life  - not my cup of tea, actually

Then you've got some really memorable groups: Katrina and the Waves, Culture Club, Duran Duran, Paul Hardcastle, Climie Fisher, Wilson Phillips, Mike Oldfield (remember the theme from the Exorcist? - but did he really have any HITS?), etc.

There's a lot of videos here for your money. Are they all great songs? No, but then I doubt you'll buy a regular CD for any group and like ALL the songs on it.

Deal with it! It's worth the dough.",1148256000,3,1242,4.388646288209607
7967034,5,B00006BSH8,I love this dvd - mine came region free which means I can take back to Europe this summer.  There are several more in this collection which I am trying to find - please let me know if you find a supplier - thanks!,1139961600,,213,3.840909090909091
