8081360,5,B000B3O2J6,deeply moving and a glorious journey towards self acceptance and embracing life as it presents itself. One of the jewels of Italian Cinema.,1456012800,,139,5.086956521739131
8081361,5,B000B3O2J6,"This is a neat, quirky movie. I saw it over thirty years ago and have been looking for it since VCRs came into being and later, DVDs. I guess at some point I missed it in VHS, but now I was able to get a DVD and enjoyed it all over again.

The seller was great, the DVD arrived quickly, and thirty years later I saw a lot more in the movie than I had when I was younger. Now I see it's a movie about aging and letting go of the past -- something many of us need to deal with.

And contrary to reviewers thirty years ago, I have always loved the birthday party scene! It's utterly charming.",1372204800,2,589,3.9
