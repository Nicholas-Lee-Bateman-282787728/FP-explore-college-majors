7832773,4,6302969751,"Does anybody actually watch these films before reviewing them? One reviewer, basing comments on childhood memories, says this movie is in black and white. In fact, it's in wonderful color (using an old process that makes every scene look beautifully hand-tinted)! As for the movie, this is a sentimental tale of the very best kind, a story about caring and sharing and childhood innocence made by a first-rate director (Oscar-winner Carol Reed). It's a largely forgotten treasure that richly deserves its new life on DVD.",1196553600,6,521,5.141176470588236
7832774,3,6302969751,"Joe (Jonathan Ashmore)is a six-year-old slum boy who believes in the magical power of unicorns. A perverse old man convinces Joe that if he could only come upon the legendary unicorn, he could grant all the wishes of his poor neighbors. Joe finds a unicorn, but it is a single-horned goat - will it have magical powers after all?

This movie holds some magic for nostalgic fans and little kids, but the rest might want to save their farthings.

7832775,5,6302969751,"I approached this DVD with some trepidation; I'd loved this film as a child, from black-and-white tv viewings, and was afraid I'd be disappointed seeing it as an adult.  Happily, I still loved it!  KID stands alone in the works of Carol Reed, an intriguing mix of fantasy and kitchen-sink realism, and it's received a nice transfer here.  The Technicolor is luscious in that 50's way that makes you want to crawl up into the screen and live for a while.  Very touching, nicely judged performance from Diana Dors, and fine work from favorites like Celia Johnson, Brenda de Banzie and Lou Jacobi.  My only caveat is that this disc is apparently being marketed as a children's movie (I found it in the kid's section of three different stores in NYC), and, despite my childhood affection for it, KID's not really aimed at children.  The Cockney dialect and different world of 50's Jewish London will probably be difficult, if not off-putting, for many active moppets.  But for adults, and the kind of child who's reflective, dreamy, and curious about the world, the picture's still magic.  Take a chance and see it.",1068681600,27,1111,4.780104712041885
7832776,5,6302969751,"I am now 53 years old and I still remember this movie from my childhood in 50's England. I so loved this movie, it was wonderful. I am about to order it. Of course, as an adult, I may have a different perspective now but I can hardly think I will like it any less. I can't even remember one other movie I saw as a kid, but I sure remember this one! Diana Dors was great. ...she really did an excellent job in this movie and it was sweet and touching as a story can get without being sappy. If you are curious about this film, I'd say, go for it. It will at least be an interesting look at British movie making in the fifties and you'll see what a different world it was back then. At best, you'll want to share it with your friends and as many kids as you can find that will sit still for a black and white movie.",1034812800,12,813,3.9036144578313254
7832777,5,6302969751,"I had seen this movie when I was in 13.  I was so touched, I've never forgotten this film since I ever had It made me think about ""truth life"" even though I was too young. After all, It comes to the best infleuential movie of my childhood. Recently, I found it by my contry websites that related movie. I'm so surprised. 'cuz ..I thought that mostly people in my country(I'm a korean) didn't watch. but A few remember it. They almost said ""It's really good one""
