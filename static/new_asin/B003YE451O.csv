4228562,3,B003YE451O,"While I am generally satisfied with this DVD set - the transfer is of good quality, with no apparent deletion of any material from the original PBS broadcast - potential buyers should be aware that the final episode on the last DVD, ""Peace With Honor"", contains only the first hour of what is a two-hour episode. The final chapters of the war, including the fall of Saigon, are completely missing as a result. This was disappointing to discover, and just seems to be an oversight which was not caught during this set's production.",1292198400,43,530,4.709677419354839

4228566,3,B003YE451O,"I enjoyed the film as a trip down Memory Lane, with all of the good and bad that qualification implies. However, historical events are meaningless unless placed in the context of the time and from the perspective of both sides of a dispute. It also becomes a bit tiresome in that, if you are an aficionado of the war in Vietnam's history and own a number of different DVDs on the subject, a great deal of the footage is recycled from previous outputs on the subject and offers nothing new.

4228572,1,B003YE451O,"We conservatives are accustomed to a leftward slant in popular media. But this video is beyond the pale. I frequently found myself shocked by its strident advocacy. ""Did they really just say that?"" I thought to myself repeatedly. Now many moderately informed people will watch this and rate it 3 to 5 stars. However, fair-minded viewers more steeped in the material -- be they liberal or conservative -- will recognize this as coming squarely from the anti-American left and rate it in the 1 to 2 range. Though written and produced by British leftists, it could easily pass for the North Vietnamese official history of the war. Compare, for instance the  film's characterization of the governments of Ho Chi Minh and Diem during the years immediately after the Geneva Accords. Ho gets off with nary a complaint while Diem is skewered as a brutal and repressive despot. Remember the Accords allowed free movements of populations across the 17th parallel in the months after the agreement? Over 800,000 persons left North Vietnam to escape to South Vietnam. Perhaps 40,000(?) came from South to North. For the narrator of this film that was because of a ""Black Propaganda"" campaign pulled off by the CIA! I kid you not. With its tone thus set, it proceeds from year to year across the conflict never deviating from its pro-communist posture. I teach this material at the college level. I was trained as an infantry platoon leader in the USMC. Aspects of this documentary are elucidating to the extent that they clearly describe the mindset of the North Vietnamese while, at the same time, they boldly present what the worst critics of the anti-communist forces have to say about them. If you buy this video thus prepared, it can be a worthwhile purchase.

I looked forward to each evening after work and after dinner when I could settle into my lounger and become better educated on this conflict.  Growing up in the 60's I remember some things from the CBS Evening News casts and from current events in middle and high schools, and then watching this series really helped me put it all into perspective.  I liked the frequent switch to maps, outlining the units and movements and then back to archival footage of troops.  I have viewed other Vietnam documentaries, including a very good one narrated by Walter Cronkite, but this one stands out more like one I would be seeing at in a Military Science course in college where much time was made to look objectively at tactics, troops, mistakes and results.  I have never seen so much footage of NVA-VC origin in any documentary.  Some is very grainy and hard to view but that is the nature of the film quality of the time.  I got a much better perspective of Vietnamization and I think my perspective on war from Tet to the final withdrawing of from the US Embassy in Saigon has been changed and improved by the study of this documentary.  Growing up with this war seeing reports nightly as it happened and now seeing this documentary as a seasoned adult, I know now how much I missed or was glossed over when I was a kid.

But the episodes on this (and the accompanying Tet! DVD) are not the original episodes I saw.  Details are missing, and it makes the series now feel way to unfocused.  Also, the episodes seem to end strangely which is further suggestion there's been some editing afoot.

If you buy the DVD's the episodes are not in the correct order.  If you look at the wikipedia article for the entire Battlefield series:  [...]  The Series Three (Vietnam) shows the correct order (another insight into these not being the original, in-tact episodes is that ""The Undeclared War"" and ""Search and Destroy"" are shown as individual episodes, whereas on the DVD they are combined into 1 episode).

This is an excellent series that covers the Vietnam War from 1954-1975.  Each episode is approximately 1 hour long and it's one of the best documentaries I've seen on the subject as it provides a very good overview of the many battles and political events that happened during the war.  It presents everything that unfolded in an impartial way and it is done entirely with narration over archival footage and computer generated battle maps, there are no combat veteran interviews.

This Blu-ray disc includes these six episodes:

1.)  Dien Bien Phu - The Legacy
- Covers the battle at Dien Bien Phu in 1954 and the resulting expulsion of the French and the division of the country into a North and South Vietnam.

2.)  The Undeclared War
- Covers the US's growing invovlement from military advisors to combat troops after the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.  Also covered is Operation Starlight which was the US Marines first battle against the Vietcong in 1965.

3.)  Search and Destroy
- Covers the US Army's first battle against the NVA at the Ia Drang Valley in 1965 and the strategy and tactics of the US and North Vietnamese in their efforts to win the war.

4.)  Air War Vietnam
- Covers the early years of the Air War with American and South Vietnamese pilots flying tandem to the beginning of the Rolling Thunder campaign.

5.)  Rolling Thunder
- Covers the air attacks on North Vietnam by US forces during Operation Rolling Thunder in 1965-68.

6.)  Peace with Honor
- Covers the struggle US forces have in turning the ground war over to the South Vietnamese and their effort to destroy NVA bases in Laos and Cambodia in 1970.  This episode ends with the NVA's buildup before the Easter Offensive of 1972.

The episodes on this disc are presented in a full screen presentation as they were when first broadcasted, they're unfortunately not formatted for widescreen tv's, so when viewing the whole picture on those types of televisions you will see black bars on the sides.

If there's any drawback to the series, it's that it glosses over some key US battles that occurred in the final years of the war. There's barely a mention of the battles on ""Hamburger Hill"" in 1969 and there's no mention of the US Navy's success in 1972 after it had implemented the Topgun school for its fighter pilots.  Also, the episodes are presented in a somewhat confusing way, they're not in production order or chronological order between the two companion discs.

Even with the few drawbacks, this series is very good and I would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in learning more about the Vietnam War. By the time you're finished with all 12 episodes, it will have been like taking a Vietnam history class, you will be way more knowledgable on the subject.",1339372800,8,3309,5.027522935779817
4228584,3,B003YE451O,"I have been watching this series for years. When the Military Channel stopped airing it, I watched it on Youtube.  I was very happy to see it come to blue-ray.

4228586,5,B003YE451O,"I keep hearing that ""its a good all around documentary"" and ""there are better more detailed, but this one is overall very good,"" and that sort of thing. I don't disagree, but I also believe there is such thing as beating a dead horse. You can go into much greater detail, and blah blah blah but eventually it becomes so long and the objectives and points to be made get lost in translation. WW2 has no trouble in the amount of information and material that can be expressed, so there are dozens of stabs at it. But because there was so much effort into WW2 that a documentary covering it has to be ultra long and massively detailed. Vietnam is the opposite, there isn't too many documentaries on it, and most of the ones I come across don't do enough or spend too much time on what a few soldiers did (Hint Hint History Channel). That doesn't tell me the bigger picture. But when I happened across Battlefield Vietnam, it was detailed, yet concise. Vietnam needs footage more than most other summaries of conflicts, and Battlefield Vietnam delivers with amazing footage that almost show what everyone does or had to do and the environment they were in. The narration sticks to the objective and concisely explains the various chapters of the war and the different entities involved. I could go for a more detailed one, but I'd always come back to this one because it's only as long as it needs to be and appropriately explains the overall large picture.",1330214400,,1453,4.592307692307692
4228587,4,B003YE451O,"Just a comment or two....generally I recommend the series of programs documenting the Vietnam War, but it seems the final chapter of the war - the North Vietnamese capture of Saigon was ommited - there's an abrupt editing of the credits, which obviousily interrupts the program - strange that they would market the DVD with possibly sixty minutes missing.",1325030400,2,355,5.033898305084746

-Politics and propaganda: South Vietnamese, North Vietnamese and American.
-American, North Vietnamese and Viet Cong battle tactics.
-The background of and thought process of the leaders involved

Most important, there is a great amount of North Vietnamese and Viet Cong recordings. This is a great, long video for those interested in politics and history.",1321574400,,598,5.294736842105263
4228589,4,B003YE451O,"I enjoyed this series very much.  However, the final segment, ""Peace With Honor"", features an extensive, and highly informative, buildup to the final battle for Vietnam.  Then...the closing credits.  We never are told or shown what happened to cause South Vietnam's final collapse and takeover by the National Liberation Front and the North Vietnamese regular army.  No fall of Saigon.  No fleeing refugees at the U.S. Embassy.  No South Vietnamese helicopters being shoved off the decks of U.S. aircraft carriers.  No baby orphan airlift in C5A's.  No South Vietnamese people settling in the United States because of their close ties with the U.S. during the war.

It is a long, and very detailed, series.  Just no final ending.  As if it were left off by mistake when this edition was produced.  The cover, under the ""Peace With Honor"" header, does state, ""Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese.  Vietnam was re-united.""  That's not depicted, and that's a genuine shame.",1321142400,5,970,5.056962025316456
4228590,5,B003YE451O,"This series is the best visual history of the Vietnam conflict that I have seen.  The 9 episodes were originally issued in 1998 as part of a 12 VHS series by Time Life, although the box doesn't indicate this.  The other three episodes, including the Fall of Saigon, are included in the companion set Battlefield Vietnam: Tet.  Together they form a fairly comprehensive history of the Vietnam conflict from 1954 until the fall of Saigon in 1975.

Of particular interest for those who are unfamiliar with the origins of American involvement is the first episode, which deals with the end of the French colonial period with the defeat of the French at Dien Bien Phu, the political negociations involving the French, Vietnamese, Chinese and Americans, the 'temporary' division of Vietnam into Northern and Southern regions pending elections which were never held, and the growing American political, economic and military involvement.

The series gives especially good insight into the military strategies and tactics followed by the different sides throughout the conflict.  Highly recommended.",1298678400,16,1091,5.313953488372093
4228591,4,B003YE451O,"I have always been favorably disposed to the ""Battlefield"" series of documentaries for their objective coverage of battles or campaigns as well as the production quality of the videos and this three-disc set is no exception.

This three-disc set covers the Vietnam conflict from roughly the tail end of the French involvement right through to the very end resulting in Communist victory over the south in 1975.

The video series covers not only the military aspects of the conflict but also the political aspects, showing mistakes made not only by the U.S. and their South Vietnamese allies, but also by the North and the NLF operating in the south. The video did a credible job of showing the often confused political objectives of the Johnson administration compared to a communist Vietnamese leadership who were united and unwavering in their goal of total victory.

Military aspects are covered very well, making good use of archival footage from both sides appropriate for the subjects covered. Explanations of significant battles and their results were generally very good. Their use of 3D maps showing movements of military units were very good at showing what each side was trying to do and what actually happened. Explanations of weapons used was appropriate and effective in highlighting the tactical capabilities of both sides.

There were a few small issues I didn't like. Firstly, the series is not exactly in chronological order and there is some overlap resulting in the viewer having to cover some ground twice. The segments on the air war and ""Rolling Thunder"" cover the entire war period instead of integrating it into the other segments as required. That is a matter of personal preference, though.

Secondly, in an attempt to remain objective (a good thing usually) the series refuses to make judgements on decisions made or tactics used. At several points in the series, they point out that the Americans (or the communist leadership) did such-and-such because they felt it was the best way to contribute to a victory. The problem is that, by being so rigidly objective, they refuse to say: ""But the Americans (or the communist Vietnamese) were wrong. The actual results of their operations were...""

These are relatively small reservations about the series and is perhaps something that would irritate the serious historian more than the general audience.

I feel this is a good and complete series on the Vietnam conflict. It is a well-produced, researched, informative and a reasonably in-depth series on the Vietnam war at a very reasonable price. I feel it is superior to the PBS and other series and I recommend it with four stars.",1295568000,17,2658,5.054794520547945

The narrative traces Americas gradual involvement in supporting the South, the subsequent escalation in 1966, the gradual de-escalation and eventual withdrawal.  Much of the documentary is devoted to the military aspects of the war.  A notable feature was that unlike the Korean War, it was fought without clearly demarcated front lines  the term area war was coined in response.  At times, the documentary gets lost in the thicket of detail, and tends to miss the over-arching political issues.  North Vietnam viewed the war as one of national reunification after a century of colonization.  The regime was willing to take heavy casualties (on the order of 1.4 million, with over 840,000 killed outright) in order to achieve this.  American policy makers viewed it as a war against communism, despite the fact that in 1962, the Sino-Soviet split had demonstrated that communism was not monolithic.
