8456043,5,B005407UAO,"Percy Danforth has long been an icon of bones playing, and I did not know this CD existed.  Bones are easy to carry around and can be used anywhere when a rhythmic beat is needed.  In addition, this CD gives instructions on how to make good ones - a near forgotten art.  It takes some practice to become automatic, but keep at it and you can throw in some spontaneous taps most anywhere at the drop of a hat!",1407715200,,408,4.139240506329114
