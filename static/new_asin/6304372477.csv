7869000,5,6304372477,This is a great video - a collector's item - with the Three Stooges at their best. I use it to further the education of my grandchildren.,1294790400,,137,4.111111111111111
7869001,5,6304372477,"A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN (1936) - An excellent stooge short! This would have to be one of my favorite Curly shorts. The scene where the stooges are trying to get up into their tiny top bunk is hilarious!
GENTS WITHOUT CENTS (1944) - a very good short. This is the one with the memorable Niagara Falls routine.
TERMITES OF 1938 (1938) - A stooge classic! The stooges, as exterminators, are mistaken for escorts! Another excellent short!
A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN, GENTS WITHOUT CENTS, and TERMITES OF 1938: All 3 are stooge gems. Definitely add this one to your collection!",1014508800,,565,4.603960396039604
7869002,3,6304372477,"A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN was kind of funny. Too many great gags. However, none of the short matches up to the fabulous ending. The conductor (Bud Jamison) throws the Stooges off the train and they fall off a cliff. Then they land on wild, bucking cows and head off, woop wooping. That is one of the funniest endings ever, if not the funniest. The ending was reused in A DUCKING THEY DID GO.
GENTS WITHOUT CENTS was pretty boring, however. Not even the ""Slowly I turn"" routine can liven up the short. Too many dancing and acting sequences.
TERMITES OF 1938 was a little funnier than the previous, but this dragged a little, too. Still, some funny scenes worth watching.
A nice collection, worth buying.",1011312000,,698,4.5476190476190474
7869003,4,6304372477,"A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN (1936) is excellent. Non-stop hilarity all the way, and the berth scene is a hoot. The ending with the Stooges being thrown off the train and landing on the backs of wild bulls is also one of the funniest endings ever.
GENTS WITHOUT CENTS (1944) is a short I was never able to like much. I never was a fan of musical numbers, and this short, unfortunately, has a lot of them. The only thing that keeps this interesting is the ""Niagra Falls"" routine. It's hilarious, and Moe's acting is excellentin that sequence.  You have to watch that scene carefully to fully appreciate Moe's dramatic acting skills as well as his comical skills.  But the rest...ehh....
TERMITES OF 1938 (1938) has a few slow parts like the dinner table scene which really dragged, but still a very good short. I loved the scene where the Stooges are ""playing"" instruments with a record player secretly playing in the background, and then mice come out of the instruments suddenly and the whole crowd makes a run for it. Hilarious ending, too.",994204800,,1035,4.619565217391305
7869004,4,6304372477,"A PAIN IN THE PULLMAN has vaudevillians Moe, Larry, and Curly traveling by train. Of course, it isn't quite as simple as that, as the trip becomes a nightmare for all concerned. GENTS WITHOUT CENTS is  notable for their  famous rendition of the burlesque chestnut ""Slowly I Turned"" and  for the dance specialties by Lindsay, Laverne, and Betty. TERMITES OF 1938  finds the Stooges as exterminators mistaken for professional escorts. If  you know the Stooges, you'll know what to expect in these three shorts.",956793600,4,508,5.0
