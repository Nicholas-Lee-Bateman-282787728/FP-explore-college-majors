It has vampire looking Ecco-goths - aka ""the Hex girls"" who look like the youth that are  doing damage in our high schools today.  DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO. Save your  child from the horror.

1237816,4,B00000JQTW,"I have fond memories watching this repeatedly when I was younger, but didn't remember more than a few moments. I bought the DVD expecting it to either be amazing or a huge disappointment, but you know what? It was just okay. And that's fine. It's for kids. Classic Scooby Doo style with all the tropes and cliches and hallmarks of the franchise. And a plot that, for once, keeps you guessing. Despite a few plot holes. And of course the introduction of the Hex Girls, the goth band now recurring in the series.

So despite having to wait more than two days for it to ship (Amazon has really spoiled us with that), it was well worth the wait and I'm glad to own it. Quite possibly the best piece of Scooby-Doo work since the original series ended.",1501200000,,746,4.405797101449275

1237896,2,B00000JQTW,"This film is poor with very few redeeming features. This movie is for the people who say they like the original series but must be lying because those characters are drawn incorrectly and animated wrong with the wrong voices for a few movies. People say that the films made around the turn of the century are better drawn. They are not. The animation is also said to be better than the 80s films. That is not true. The animation is actually inferior except with Zombie Island. No one who is actually a fan of Scooby Doo should purchase this. Trying to make it better than the original series instead of honoring it makes the movie quite subpar. After watching this, I wonder what the point was in this film being made. They should have just cancelled this project. The reason I give this film 2 stars is because it's not unwatchable. It is just completely unfulfilling with zero signifigance.",1470355200,,892,4.616352201257862

The parents upset about there being reference to Wicca and how the movie paints it as being good, guess what! Wicca is a very peaceful religion with no evil anywhere! There are far more religions in this world other then Christianity some of which including paganism which is where Wicca gets its base is much older then Christianity. Even tho you may not agree with something, especially something you know nothing about, does not mean you can be disrespectful by calling someone else's views evil.",1468713600,,649,4.603448275862069

1237947,5,B00000JQTW,"I grew up watching Scooby Doo, the original series, and then through all the re-boots they have done over the decades. People always complain about the re-boots never meeting their expectations and how the classics are better but I'm just glad Scooby Doo gets the opportunity to resurface throughout the years and not fade away into history. I'm in college now but I still love Scooby Doo and am finally getting to own all of the series and movies :)",1454544000,,450,4.6375
1237948,5,B00000JQTW,"In the summer of 1999 my wife was pregnant with our son. Thinking of all of the time I would soon be spending with my little dude, I started watching some of the cartoons I loved as a kid. Scooby was at the top of the list !  In those days people still rented movies from video stores. VHS tapes no less. Just after our son was born in the fall, the Witch's Ghost was released. I rented it the first week it was out in October of '99. I can't tell you how thrilled I was to watch this movie for the first time. This was the Scooby-Doo story us fans deserved.

A haunted New England village in fall. A Stephen King-ish horror writer. A Salem type witch story. A group of hot, goth, girl rockers !  I watched it twice before I returned it to the rental shop. It's the perfect Halloween Scooby movie.

Fast forward a few years and DVD is all the rage and movie fans are building their own home libraries instead of driving to the video rental store. I bought this title, Zombie Island from 1998, and Alien Invaders from 2000. My son and I have watched them many times. I have had to repurchase them a few times. One of the best things about these three movies is the voice of Shaggy. Scott Innes voices him in the latter two and Billy West does Shaggy for Zombie Island. I like Innes better but the change is seamless and young kids would not notice the acting switch. Innes also voices Scoobert for these movies as well but it's Shaggy that is the stand out. It is my favorite Shaggy voice since Casey Kasem in the original series. When Kasem was younger his voice was also perfect for Shaggy. The first Scooby episode , What a Night for a Knight (also called the Black Knight episode), from 1969, introduces a great Shaggy character voiced to perfection by the mid-thirtyish Kasem. Innes' voice fits Shaggy's personality wonderfully and is a big part of why I love this movie. I think his Scooby is a bit too high pitched but...small issue.

Also lending his considerable voice to this movie is Tim Curry. I can't remember ever meeting anyone who doesn't love Curry. He's a great Ben Ravencroft. Daphne is played here by the late Mary Kay Bergman. She too is great and gives Daphne a cutesy, confident, playful voice that works well with the ubiquitous Frank Welker's Fred. My son doesn't like Velma's voice in this movie. BJ Ward is Velma in this, the two movies listed above, and in Cyber Chase from 2001. I like her and think she has the right raspiness and know-it-all attitude to be Velma. The Mayor of Oakhaven is awesome. He sounds like a kind of country-bumpkin Kennedy and instantly alerts you to the New Enlgand location.

And then there are the Hex Girls. Ah...if only I were a young, single, Eco-goth, cartoon me...oops. My wife might read this. The Hex girls are wonderful and make more appearances in future Scooby episodes. All three of them are great but like Freddy, I'm stuck on Thorn, the Wiccan (1/16th on her mother's side).

I won't go into the plot of the movie because I don't want to spoil it for those who have yet to see it. Needless to say, I am a big Scooby fan ! I am thrilled my now 16 yr old son has watched lots of Scooby-Doo and likes it almost as much as his dad. If you or your kids only watch a few of the Scooby movies this one and Zombie Island are tops for sure. Zombie Island is actually a bit scary for kids though...just a warning. I once came across a thread on Reddit about how scary the now 20-something posters found Zombie Island when they were 8 or 10 yrs old and watched it. So maybe watch that one with your kids just in case. Even if it doesn't scare them, you'll get to watch one of the two best Scooby movies ever made ! Zoinks!!",1454284800,,3682,4.304473304473304

1238061,3,B00000JQTW,"Released in 1999, SCOOBY-DOO! AND THE WITCHS GHOST is the second in the feature length (sixty-seven minutes) cartoons created specifically for the home market.  This particular outing has the gang in small-town New England, where the ghost of Sarah Ravenscroft, a legendary witch, has been sighted.  The gangespecially Velmaworks with Sarahs descendent Ben (voiced by no less than Tim Curry) to debunk the ghost and to find Sarahs diary, which Ben says will prove she was not a witch but a Wiccan healer who was wrongfully persecuted by the town.  Along the way the gang meets rock-and-rollers The Hex Girls, a trio scheduled to play at the harvest festival and who become unwillingly involved in the mystery.

Nobody would describe the Scooby-Doo series as high art, but it is well imagined.  The characters are updates on the original 1960s Saturday morning cartoon characters, the animation is very good, and the story is interestingand as in many of the feature length releases there really are some unexpected supernatural forces at work, which gives everything an added twist.  But I did have a bit of a problem with one particular plot point, in which the story (a) seems to describe Wiccans as a specific race, which they are not; and (b) seems to define Wiccans as benign healers of an older age, which they were not; and (c) last but not least states that Wiccans and witches are not the same, which is a highly contentious issue that pretty much depends on who you ask.

Ultimately, this is one of the few Scooby-Doo flicks that I would say parents need to preview before allowing it to be seen by your children.  Its not that it is unusually scary, but the Wiccan issue may be something parents would prefer to avoidor at least postpone until a later date.

1238112,5,B00000JQTW,"Before viewing this masterpiece of cinematic magic (`cinemagic', if you will), my best friend and I had assumed we were sitting down for an easy-to-digest animated feature. We had grown up watching ""Scooby-Doo!"", and suspected the film to be something along the lines of a happy-go-lucky mystery where a biblical moral ending was sure to be its conclusion. We couldn't have been more wrong.

The film is based on a true story that took place in the historic town of Oakhaven, Massachusetts. After viewing ""...the Witch's Ghost"", my best friend and I made a pilgrimage to the famous Salem Trials site- and may I just say, walking on the same grounds that Ben Ravencroft roamed sent shivers down our spines.

The filmmakers' depictions of the real life Ben Ravencroft- though at times teetering on the edge of fiction- truly did an overall fantastic job of displaying the historic character as he factually was- a brilliant academic.

Scooby and the gang were portrayed very accurately. I was blown away at how the dog actor truly understood and embodied the juxtaposition of his character's plight: how to manage his fear and bravery. How he wasn't even considered for an Academy Award nomination I feel was a crime- though I suppose it has something to do with the Academy's apparent prejudice against animated documentary. But don't get me started.

Where do I even begin with the spectacular sonic experience that is Hex Girls? That I had never heard of this all-female-trio with their contrapuntal mastery of a Baroque composer is a crime to my iTunes library. To get my hands on their sheet music would be heavenly. One can tell the three members of Hex Girls come from prestigious musical upbringings. I have never before heard such ambiguous, Romantic-era chordal progressions executed so effectively in rock music. Thorn, the lead singer and guitarist, pulls from her roots of Gospel Chant and applies her lyrical timbre to the eloquent lexicon that is Hex Girls storytelling. I found the filmmakers' choice to not line up the image with what the audience is actually hearing in real time (i.e., the drummer- Dusk- shown not playing on beat, or even playing the wrong drum) genius; such subtlety in their use of desyncronization. How very avant-garde! ""Earth, Wind, Fire, and Air"" and their self titled hit single, ""Hex Girl"", both made it to the Top 40 in Canada, Poland, and England.

The mise-en-scene in this film is breathtaking. The director of photography should be lauded for his use of chiaroscuro to subtly indicate the psychological angst the characters experience. This is especially poignant in regards to the muted allusions of substance abuse (Scooby Snacks). Also tackled is the prejudice against Wiccans and the bigotry they face throughout the age-old persecution suffered under the colonial tyranny brought on by more widely accepted religious institutions.

This film is a cinematic tour de force. I'm glad I bought the DVD from Amazon.com.",1410652800,2,2967,5.032586558044806

It was nice to see Mr. Curry not always act so over-the-top as he does in films such as Home Alone 2.  Therefore, his role worked and he complemented our favorite crime-solving gang quite nicely.  The film itself had a darker feel to it and that worked and perhaps contributed to Mr. Curry's success in his role.

Sure, it's a bit different, but it still retains the charm of Mystery, Inc., and there's nothing wrong with that.  Enjoy.",1401235200,,809,4.661971830985915

We grew up with the older, original show but this didn't bother us in the least bit. I'm 20 now and he's 18 and we still love this movie. For those who dislike it for it's Wiccan and Witchyness--seriously, stop being so narrow-minded. It does no one any good to purposefully keep people away from other religions (this is the 21st century afterall) and we need to be more accepting. Besides, Wicca is a nature loving religion and not Satanic (if they don't believe in the Abrahamic God then how can they worship Satan, hmm?). I think this would be a great starter for a multicultural discussion of different religions. Also, for the whole ""It's not good because the monster is real"" thing, hello, don't you think it's time that we stop lying to our children about there are no monsters? Granted not mummy/vampire monsters but humans are just as evil so instead of complaining, why not use this to teach your children that they have to be careful who they trust and yada yada yada.

Then came the so-called explanation of Wicca and how Wiccans are largely misunderstood. I sat down to watch and tried to stay with it for another 20 minutes or so but I just could not sit there and let my 3 year old soak this in.

This movie glamorizes and sexualizes Wicca. I can't say much about the plot because we only made it about half way through before it got thrown in the trash.

The memories I have of Scooby Doo definitely differ from this movie.  Its blatantly pro-Wiccan premise is, frankly, weird.  I think I would think that any religious context in a Scooby Doo movie is weird.  The fun and entertainment value of Scooby was the innocent mystery solving almost by happenstance.  The resolution was typically a ruse- no one actually had powers, let alone demonic ones. Yeah generic witches are fine, but glorfying a pagan religion- just not Scooby.  Go for a video with the vintage characters and story lines- kids love that, and so do parents.

I have 2 ex-Hollywood friends who agree that secularism has totally taken over film and media.  This is just another example of it.  Any potential buyers, stick to the original series.",1281744000,3,528,4.673913043478261
1238244,5,B00000JQTW,"When I was about 8 years old (Im about to turn 21) they started coming out with new Scooby Doo movies and Scooby Doo and the Witches Ghost was my absolute favorite.
I've noticed that a LOT of people have given this movie 1 star because they feel that the wiccan aspects of this film are too much for their children.
I would just like to say this: If you have a child that is very curious and willing to do leg work to gain further information pertaining to wicca and that would bother you as their parent, then I don't suggest letting your kid watch this. I was that type of child but my mother didn't prescreen anything I watched plus the first time I saw this film it was on Cartoon Network.
On the other hand if you have a child that you think will take the movie for what it is and not think a thing of it after its over then I wouldnt worry too much about the wiccan influences.
The thing is, while there are mentions of Wicca, its not totally accurate and kind of sugar coats it. When Velma defines what a Wiccan is she says something to the effect of ""Wiccans were healers who used the power of nature"". Yes, Wiccans are all about nature and can be into herbal healing but to say that Wiccans are HEALERS and not participants in the RELIGION of Wicca is really sugar coating it for their viewing audience. Also the movie insinuates that to be Wiccan is like being Italian or British or Polish ect. Seriously, Thorn, the lead singer of the Hex Girls, claims to be 1/16 Wiccan. What??
I cant even begin to guess why they decided to throw Wicca into this story. But is it offensive? No. Is it damaging to traditional Christian, Jewish, ect beliefs? No. Is it even accurate and educating its viewers on the religion of Wicca? No! To be honest I truly feel that all the people who gave it 1 star because of the wiccan influences (who I can only assume are serious Christians or Jews or ect) should be glad... this movie actually makes a total mockery of the religion and down plays it to look like something that should be lumped in with mummies, zombies and vampires.
Its a cute movie and fun to watch but if you are concerned that your overly ambitious child is going to research and learn about Wicca, then avoid this movie at all costs!",1281312000,12,2242,4.290094339622642

Don't buy this movie unless you want your children to think wiccan is a great lifestyle.  We watched this once and threw it out - in fact, my 6 year-old threw it out happily for me. We didn't even want to pass it on to someone else. I  have always loved Scooby-Doo and the distinction between good guys and bad guys, but the lines are blurred in this one.

1238246,1,B00000JQTW,The themes presented in this Scooby Doo movie are not at all age appropriate for the targeted audience. What I used to love about Scooby Doo is that the monsters were never real and in the end the mystery was solved. I wish I had pre-screened this one before letting my 5 y.o. watch it. Bad decision on my part. I'd love to see them put as much Christian propaganda into a Scooby Doo movie as the pro-wiccan propaganda featured in this film.,1264636800,4,441,4.325301204819277

1238254,1,B00000JQTW,"My 2- and 5-year-old kids love Scooby Doo. I'm not a big fan, but will sit through it for their sakes; however, I was very unhappy with ""Scooby Doo and the Witch's Ghost"".

The first half of the show was just fine, as it was the typical Scooby formula (ie, the culprit is revealed as a regular person and the world is safe again). Unfortunately, the problem arose in the second half. You think the movie is over, but then the horror author character suddenly proclaims himself a real warlock and conjures up his witch ancestor to presumably take over the world. The next several minutes have the real witch and warlock chasing after and threatening Scooby and the Gang. This change eliminated the typical, formulaic Scooby ""safety"" of knowing that there is a real person and a logical explanation behind the scary effects. It made me quite uncomfortable and frightened my children.

The other problem I had with this movie was its pro-Wiccan message.  Before any Wiccans argue with me, save it.  If you aren't bothered by it, then you'll obviously enjoy this movie more than we did.  I, on the other hand, take serious exception when the Hollywood crowd use a kid's cartoon to try and push their personal beliefs and agenda onto young, impressionable children. I think it is totally inappropriate and it actually makes me quite angry--especially when they are trying that crap with MY kids.

Frankly, this Scooby has put me off of getting any more of the newer Scooby Doo movies for my kids, since I don't like the direction they have taken. Fortunately for me, I bought this thing at the thrift store and so didn't spend too much money on it. As soon as I realized the nature and intent of the movie, it was out of our home and right back at the thrift store. And, even without the ""real"" witch stuff and the pro-Wiccan message, I though it was a lousy story and my kids didn't enjoy it at all.  So, if you don't appreciate Hollywood's attempts to brainwash your kids into accepting things with which you disagree, then avoid this movie.",1250899200,,2038,4.613259668508287

And to those that say that there were never 'monsters' in the Scoobie-verse before this are sorely mistaken:

Scooby Doo meets the Boo brothers
Scoody Doo and the Reluctant Werewolf
Scooby Doo and the Ghoul School

All of these have real monsters, and I don't hear parents being up-in-arms about them. And yes, they do have content that is just as bad as Witches Ghost, and incidentally Zombie Island. They just have some 'good' monsters in the movie too.
Get over it. The movie is different from the original series.
If your child can't handle a monster being 'real', then don't let them watch this movie.

These movies aren't an abomination in the Scoobie-verse, but a different take on the series itself. As a kid I always wanted one of the monsters to be real, having a monster being just a guy in a mask doesn't erase the scary image a kid might see.

And oh my, it tries to soften/explain the Wiccan image. Like the kids are going to understand what a Wiccan really is, or remember it. Parents taking their kids to church or bible school, mentioning anything about a god, is already educating their child about some religion.

I don't see how this movie is any scarier than the likes of Finding Nemo, where 'live' characters actually die, and real threats are there throughout the entire story.
Pay attention to what your kids want to watch. Don't blame the movie for the content, blame yourself for not looking into it in the first place. Scooby Doo has always had monsters, no matter how you want to look at it.

Now, if you're a person who always wanted the monster in a Scooby show to be real, this movie might be for you. The animation style is different, bolder image style and brighter colors. The Scooby gang also have different clothing styles, going for a more 'modern' look and having real jobs.

In reading the various reviews and comments on this site as well as others I found nothing unexpected from both the Christian Right and Wiccan/Pagan Left side of the coin. I encourage those who have written to try and read all of the posts again and although it will be hard for you to pry open your closed minds just maybe you'll notice the one really interesting thing, that the outraged ""Christian"" posts are almost identical to the outraged ""Pagan/Wiccan/Witch"" posts in tone and intolerance. As for the film I don't see this as being in any way scary but you should base that on what you know of your child's disposition. My daughter has been devoted to Scooby since she was 7 months old, she is now a year and 4 months. Of all the films this is her most favorite due in large part to the band of Gothic girls called the Hex Girls.

It is darker and scarier and our young child who has no trouble with other Scooby shows was frightened in several spots, including the opening scene where the bad guys come after the gang with axes. And, as you know from other reviews, the witch is real and both she and the main human bad guy die in the end when they are entrapped inside a magic book which is then burned.

The Wicca stuff is more distracting than alarming and it's handled so confusingly there's no way anybody is going to be converted by this movie. However, they took so much time pointlessly trying to explain the differences between the good Wiccans, the evil witch, and the girl band members who just pretend to be Wiccan to sell more albums, that it detracts from the story. This is a comedy and exposition is never funny. So why is it crammed into a story that was already bloated?

1238268,3,B00000JQTW,"My son picked this movie out at Blockbuster... the first time we watched it, he was 3 and absolutely obsessed with Scooby and the gang.  He loved the movie but was a bit frightened by it.

We let our children watch Scooby because, no matter how scary the monsters look... they are always just a man in a mask.  The show used to point out how if you just use your brain you can figure out mysteries and that there are no real monsters.  That whole theory was blown out of the water by this Scooby (and Zombie Island as well).

First off, the artwork is just a little different, the colors are bolder and the creatures are drawn scarier... much scarier than... say... the Miner 49er.  Then as a parent who has probably already suffered through both the best and worst of Scooby (the Reluctant Werewolf being among the worst) you will have to suffer through a bunch of Wiccan girls in a rock band called the ""Hex Girls"" who pontificate on how wonderful the Wiccan religion is.  I don't particularly care either way about the religion of the Hex Girls, and although I have nothing against the Wiccan beliefs... I just don't see where ANY religion belongs in Scooby Doo.  Just about the point where you as a parent feel your breakfast about to make a reappearance over the constant yapping about religion... the Hex Girls sing... they aren't Bad... they just aren't good.

One of the better points of the movie is that Tim Curry makes a VO appearance... and is fabulous as always... Then we get to the point where the gang unmasks the bad guy... and you think to yourself... Okay FINALLY, this is over and I can get my TV back... but you are wrong.  Instead of ending it where they should have, a REAL GHOST OF A WITCH comes back and terrorizes Scooby and the gang.  I sat there in a fury after this was over.  Who the heck wrote this?  I thought... they missed the WHOLE POINT of Scooby... which is that the monsters are never real.

If I had been watching this with an 11 year old I probably wouldn't have had an issue with this... but the 3-6 group, who loves Scooby with all of their hearts, and drags their Scooby Stuffed animal around with them... should be able to count on Scooby and Gang always unmasking the baddie and it being the Gardener or the Butler, or the Old man from scene 1... there should NEVER be a real monster in Scooby.. NEVER.

4 stars on the Artwork
2 stars on the sound track
3 stars on the rest of the film

However, despite some strong points (the major plot twist isn't bad, and Tim Curry is better than memorable until overacting ruins it near the end), the plot drags in the middle and the big climax could have used some of the time the middle didn't need.

Also, there's a big build-up to the song the Hex-Girls (the Wiccan band mentioned in a few other reviews) are going to perform, and the show makes the mistake of having them actually perform it at the end. The song alone is bad enough that it moves me from not being sure whether to give this movie two or three stars to making it clear that it doesn't deserve more than two.

I do not view it as propaganda anymore than the countless references to churches and other common elements of our world. To those who are believers of one sort or another and are concerned that kids may be negatively impacted, relax.

The original Scooby Doo series showed kids that when the lights come on, you see there was really nothing to be afraid of. This movie was a betrayal of that ethos with the inclusion of ""real"" monsters and magic. The movie starts out great with hip, witty writing and dialogue that riffs on the Scooby legacy in a way that keeps it interesting and humorous for adults. In act two, ""Witch's Ghost"" flames-out as a kids' movie as it morphs into an animated equivalent of a teen horror flick.

The part of the movie that played like a religious tract/promo for the Wicca was just weird. Adult Scooby fans should watch this so you know I'm not making it up or exaggerating. What's going on over there at Time Warner? It's like Wicca licensed the Scooby Doo characters from them to burnish its image. No matter what your religious beliefs are, it's weird to see a religion endorsed in a major studio commercial kids' movie. If this movie played in theaters it would get a PG-13. It's not for the under 12 crowd. My kids (under 7) didn't really lock in on the Wicca thing, but they were freaked out by the monster turning out to be ""real"" and deadly--a fairly central guest character gets sucked screaming into the underworld by supernatural forces of evil.

1238284,4,B00000JQTW,"Ok, from someone who partakes in _NO_ religion at all...so there!

0 spoilers.

This is the oddest Scooby-Doo i've ever seen compared to others. The character animation looks a tad bit more dramatic. The soundtrack and sound samples are much more mastered than other Scooby-Doo's. The plot is very well thought out and takes more than just a drooling smile to follow.

Now i like these elements i have listed so far, but 1 thing as mentioned by everybody else pulled 1 star from it for me...the ghost is real. In case you missed it, i'm not religious at all. However, a real ghost? No matter how many controversial elements one might find in a Scooby-Doo, a mask of some sort should be pulled away at the end (it must be so :-).

Now, for those of you that know something about Mr. Hanna or Mr. Barbera from their interviews, articles, books, etc., they _MIGHT_ of changed the plot so the ghost was not real and that's it. At some point however, for those who go looking hard and long enough, they will find what they are looking for.  So the gang finally found it, so be it.

If you have children or a child and you choose not to show it to them, atleast watch it your adult-self. Scooby-Doo is a fantasy cartoon. Scooby-Doo has been portraying reality in it's very own fantasy all these years. It's really great to see the gang share with us, something alot of us consider fantasy, for themselves for a moment. If i wasn't so bent on seeing the mask flying off, i would of gave it a 5. Old habbits die hard :-).",1160611200,5,1513,4.366548042704626
1238285,4,B00000JQTW,"This 2nd chapter takes place almost immediately after ""Zombie Island"" concludes. While I don't consider this 2nd chapter quite as good as ""Zombie Island,"" this 2nd chapter nails down the formula for a good sequel. It brings back enough familiar elements (the gang), but it offers a different adventure. While this 2nd chapter is not quite as intense as ""Zombie Island,"" it would probably still be a good idea for parents to screen it before they give it to their children. Scooby and the gang solve a mystery (at least in part) at a museum and meet the writer Ben Ravencroft. He invites the gang to visit his 'quiet' home in Massachusetts. For an animated movie, the scenery is actually quite impressive. Well, Ben and the gang discover that the town is anything but quiet due to the publicity over the possible presence of a witch's ghost. (The Mayor and the T Shirt guy bear a striking resemblance to Boss Hogg and Sheriff Roscoe.) Naturally, our favorite gang gets curious but Scooby and Shaggy are more interested in food. (Big surprise.) There is a hilarious scene where they go to a restaurant that is too good even for them. Well, Ben and our gang meet the Hex Girls who play good music and at the same time draw some suspicion. This is a difficult movie not to ruin, but I'll try. The misleads make sense upon discovery, and just when we think the movie is over, we find out that the real horror is yet to come. Though it doesn't quite pack the punch of ""Zombie Island,"" the climax is really well done and surprisingly scarey.

You still see the scene where they unmask the villain, but it's not the real one, that comes later and it's a real monster.

I've read a lot of the reviews by other people and apparently they don't understand that time changes and so does the characters and the people who watch the series. The story of Scooby-Doo is always the same, those kids and the dog that crack the great mystery and it always turns to be a bad guy into a costume. That was nice, but it was time to change that a little bit. I like the idea of the villain in this new movie to be a real monster. Hey people do you have imagination?  Use it. Do you use the same clothes (shirts, pants)  all you life? Do you wash them? Well that's what's happening with the show. My kids love Scooby-Doo, I mean, I've been watching Scooby-Doo for more than 20 years and it's great, but I like changes too.

Some of them said that there was a lot of stuff about magic and witches, etc. Well this is a movie about a witch, so it's obvious that you'll see a lot of stuff like that. Besides, kids today are exposed to more frighten stuff than these things that are shown here, and are on shows that are supposed to be for kid under 9 or less.

As noted in other reviews, this movie does touch upon the religion of Wicca.  As a practicing Wiccan Priestess, I find it refreshing for a movie to approach the faith as a positive thing.  However, there are many inaccuracies in the movie regarding the religion. Many websites exist to find accurate information if you should choose to research the topic before purchasing or allowing your child to watch this movie.  Wicca is a life-affirming, nature-worshiping and peace-loving faith -- parents worried by the presence of religion in a mainstream child's movie need not fear that their child will be affected by the references to this particular religion.  The ""spells"" cast by Thorn (the Wiccan in the movie) is merely her mixing up an herbal drink to soothe her sore throat.  The plot is entertaining, with there being several ""bad guys"" and a sub-plot leading up to the bigger ""bad guy"".  There are no demons or such in this movie.  If your child is sensitive to scary creatures such as a pumpkin coming to life with the vines as arms and legs that chase the Scooby Doo gang... or a turkey that grows to a huge size and runs after Scooby and Shaggy... then this movie is not for them until they are older.  There is very little actual violence in the movie (there is more violence in many other cartoons found on cable).  Ben Ravencroft tricks the crime-fighting Scooby gang into helping him uncover a spellbook to bring his dead ancestor back to life.  She is an intimidating white-clad ghost that flies through the air and chases the kids around the fairsite.  There is nothing malevolent or malicious about this movie, and I'd recommend it for children four and up.  There is enough humor to keep adults mildly entertained while watching this with their children (like Shaggy & Scooby dressing as pilgrims with a turkey baster and bowl of stuffing to face off with the gigantic turkey). As in all Scooby movies, it comes full circle with the bad guys getting their just desserts and the Scooby doo gang saving the day again.",1116633600,29,2158,4.702127659574468

1238291,4,B00000JQTW,"I am honestly STUNNED by the shocking narrow-mindedness displayed by God-fearing, puritan Christians in other reviews of this DVD. There ARE other religions out there, exposing your children to them is no big deal, shielding them from it is both fascist and dangerous. And to dismiss them as evil is pure insanity. Especially Wicca. This is not a 'satanic' or 'devil-worshipping' religion and saying so only promotes further ignorance. Surely something was learned from the Dark Ages and the Salem Witch hunts. But reading other reviews here...I'm having second thoughts.
I'm actually quite glad Warner had the balls to have a plot involving Wicca and witches in a Scooby Doo cartoon. Okay, so ONE of them ultimately turns to be evil but there are evil people of all religions. Witch's Ghost is NOT pure Wiccan propaganda, it merely educates and enlightens on what is a highly misunderstood way of life. I would definitely prefer children to watch this.
The movie itself was one of the earlier efforts in the Scooby Doo revivals. Meaning that the monster is real and the writing is stronger and the gang have updated outfits. Tim Curry has a role as whacko writer Ben Ravencroft, a sort cross between HP Lovecraft and Sutter Cane, plus there is a Goth Girl Group called The Hex Girls who have a couple of cool songs. Billy Ray Cyrus sings the theme tune this time around.
There's a decent amount of mystery and humor, obviously nothing too sophisticated, to keep anyone, not just the kids, entertained. It's perfect family fun and I suggest you give it a ago and pay no attention to the insane reviews of Christian fundamentalists.
The DVD is in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn, with Dolby 2.0 sound. However, my Region 2 release has a Dolby 5.1 track that was surprisingly loud and forceful with plenty of surround effects and deep bass. Sorry, but this ain't on the Region 1 version. A small amount of okay extras are included too. This DVD is an awful snap case but my Region 2 is a sturdy keepcase.

The most frightening thing that you will find here are walking pumpkins...if this is scary, you'd better go to a doctor. This movie has a perfect soundtrack, perfect animation, perfect story...
This is my opinion, and Warner Brothers haven't still produced a movie that could be better than this one. Not even the Scooby Doo - Motion Picture, the real movie, is better than this. So, if you would not buy this one 'cuz u think it's 2 scary, forget it. It's perfect, kids will love it.",1067212800,5,633,4.418803418803419

I think some of you people need to open your minds and get a life. I can't believe the way people have to hate things that they fear and refuse to understand.
Anyways, Scooby and the gang get tricked into helping  horror writer, Ben Ravencroft. He assures the gang that his ancestor, Sarah, was merely a Wiccan healer, not an evil witch, as the town legend says.  Ben needs the gang to help him uncover the location of Sarah's ancient spell book. His secret agenda is to invoke Sarah's ghost which is trapped in the book. Great Halloween entertainment. Great music, my daughter had to get the soundtrack she enjoyed it so much. Some people said that The Witch's Ghost is not for children under 8 or so. My daughter seen this when she was 4 and she loved it, thought it was very funny. She has been a Scooby fan since she was about 3 and collects all the movies. You have to know your child and how well they decipher real life from television. Use common sense. If ghosts and witches scare your kids, don't let them watch this.
 I was impressed that the creators were brave enough to educate the viewers on Wicca, a very misunderstood way of life. It is a shame that some of the other religions pull out all the stops to be sure that Wicca stays misunderstood with the general public. The real truth about Wicca can be found in many a reputable publication (see my other reviews on these books) by anyone who is open minded enough to learn something new. Someone else had mentioned that they had a problem with some of the songs in the movie talking about loving nature. Since when is that a crime? Look at the state our environment is in right now. Perhaps if more people learned to love nature and treasure it we wouln't have so many of the environmental issues we live with today. Some people need to chill out on the religious hang-ups with this cartoon. It is ENTERTAINMENT. Lets not forget it is a free country with freedom of religion. If something in this cartoon makes you feel threatened, then I feel sorry for you.",1064966400,29,2154,4.434343434343434
1238294,5,B00000JQTW,"I grew up watching Scooby Doo cartoons and loved them! I was happy to see new movies being produced and brought it home to watch along with my daughter who is three. My husband and I both laughed all the way through, there are many sly in-jokes.
I find it amazing that so many reviewers have focused on only two issues - one that it dares to mention Wiccans in a *gasp* positive light, and two- that it is too *intense* for smaller kids. For the first issue, it's just silly to say that this movie is a lesson in Wicca. It's almost as if the other reviewers are seeing a different movie! The very few bits of dialogue that happen to mention Wicca just say that Wiccans are nature lovers or natural healers. Whoo - clap your hand over your kid's ears!!! In fact the Hex Girls explicitly say they are NOT Wiccans, they are Eco-Goths (whatever THAT means!) and that one of them is 1/16th Wiccan on her mother's side. Ohh, the horror! Their song at the end talks about loving the earth, wow what a bad idea huh? I also thought that being Wiccan is hereditary to be very funny.
The second issue, that it is too intense, is also being overblown. Some have objected to the ""real"" witch. Say it with me now, people: ""iiit's aaa caar-tooon"". There, isn't that better?  Just as in most Scooby episodes, nobody is hurt, nobody dies, there's no blood, no body parts, the explosions don't hit anyone, and the ""pumpkin spiders"" as my family calls them, are just funny. I'd rather my kid watch this than most of ""kid's"" tv or video games that are far more violent. The evening news, for example..",1050537600,11,1581,4.395904436860068
1238295,5,B00000JQTW,"This is Scooby the way he was meant to be  -  still good, clean fun for the kids, but nostalgically campy enough to appeal to their parents, as well.  The recent feature-length live-action movie took a few hints from this (and one or two of the other newer Doos), and should have followed the lead even further.  It playfully spoofs itself with the adult sensibilities of every former child fan who has now grown up, but does so with a great deal of love and affection.
Scooby and Co. begin the proceedings by solving one of their classic nutball-in-a-mask mysteries, with the usual ridiculous goings-on, delightfully underscored by the singing of the famous theme song by none other than Billy Ray ""Achy Breaky Heart"" Cyrus.  Handsome horror writer Ben Ravenscroft  -  wickedly and wonderfully voiced by Rocky Horror's Tim Curry, who excels at this kind of thing  -  then invites the gang to join him for a holiday weekend in his small New England town, which pulls out all the stops as a tourist attraction capitalizing on Ravenscroft's notorious witch ancestor.  Taking part in the proceedings is the glamorous Goth-girl group, the Hex Sisters  -  lead-voiced by Jane Weidlin  -  who, along with sundry other bizarre goings-on, suspiciously seem to indicate that something more sinister than usual is occurring at this year's Witch Fest.  Breaking the usual Scooby formula (which everyone who ever watched the show has always wanted to see happen), the Mystery, Inc. gang's quarry actually turns out, for once, to be supernatural.  Zoinks!
The animation is, needless to say, far superior to that in the original Hanna-Barbera series, which is even commented on subtly and in humorous fashion by the characters.  If hearing Billy Ray Cyrus down-homely sing the theme song while idiot bad-guys are tripping over Shag's and Scoob's improvised traps doesn't have you sufficiently chuckling from the very start, you're sure to enjoy the Hex Girls' sultry rockin'  -  the music in this movie is really very good, considering what it's in.  Fred and Daphne begin to indicate that they are more than just friends, and unlucky-in-love brainy-geek Velma has her poor heart broken, but comes through it like a trouper.  And the appearance of a few real spooks, for a change, just makes it all that much more fun.
The warnings that younger kids might be frightened by the supernatural goings-on are nonsense.  Anyone can watch this movie, and have a great time.  It's simply a delight.",1045785600,9,2476,4.941888619854722

1238298,5,B00000JQTW,"I loved this movie more than ""Zombie Island"" and ALMOST as much as ""Shrek"" (my fourth favorite movie of all time.)  No matter who you are, this film has everything.  It has comedy, drama, intrigue, suspense, magic, the paranormal, horror, and of course, Velma in her most in-depth role yet.
The fact that it has EVERYTHING, however, is what causes over-protective parents to get up in arms about this film.  As those who remember Harry Potter's every-flavored beans know, sometimes having everything can be unpleasant to some.
Now I am a geek who spent most of his life sucking up all the knowledge I could wrap my mind around, and in my opinion, truthful fact is never wrong, and this film mentions some important truthful facts which are often overlooked.
Now, to parents, ""If you don't want to know those facts, it's your own business, but hiding them from your children will only make them less prepared if they ever need those facts later in life.""  I know.  I went through that.
All in all, the ratios of Comedy, horror, etc, are ballanced in much the same way as in ""The Mummy,"" but with a little less action and a little more charm, so if you liked that film, then this one might be for you as well.

That is simply untrue as well.  This film's targeted audiance is the under 12 crowd, the same group of kids who watch Pokemon, Digimon, Dragon Ball Z, and what ever other imports network TV decides to shove down our throats at the time, which are far more ""scary"" for lack of a better term than this film.

1238306,2,B00000JQTW,"I am a big fan of Scooby Doo and grew up watching the program in the 70s.  My children now, all under 7, enjoy the programs as well on the Cartoon Network.  So I write this as somewhat of a lay-expert on our favorite teenage crime unit.
This movie, The Witches Ghost, is an alarming departure from past Scooby movies and shows.  I am communicating my problems with it for the sake of parents of (what I believed to be) the targeted audience for the program - children under 12.
1. The story line involves a real witch using very real magic.  Without giving away the plot, constant themes in the movie are hell, witchcraft, demons, and intense terror.  If it sounds like old Scooby shows, this episode goes way beyond anything covered by the cartoon before.  For a young child, this is way too intense. The cartoon resembles a teenage horror movie more than a children's cartoon.
2. The inclusion of a strong religious theme is completely inappropriate.  Wicca, the religion of witchcraft, is a constant theme of the video story, and the religion is giving a very positive billing.  At one point, one of the Scooby-gang says to a practicing witch, ""You are Wicca? That is so cool!""  Finally, the music of the video is sung by the Hex-girls, the girl band in the story, one of whom is a practicing witch.  The lyrics refer to the wicca faith and practices of worshiping the Earth and nature.  Again, this is out-of-line for children's programming.  (Would Christanity or Judaism ever recieve this covert plug from Time Warner/AOL???)
3. Finally, the entire story looks more like a teenage cartoon terror flick than a children's Scooby Doo show.  As Shaggy would say, this show will give your children, ""The Creeps.""  It is that intense. Be warned - if you are buying this for your children, give it some serious thought.  If you are some teenager still stuck in a world of Saturday morning cartoons and do not have anything better to do than watch Scooby Doo, then have at it...  I wish a certain teenage detective agency would investigate why in the world the Cartoon Network went into this territory with a classic kid's cartoon.",984528000,58,2129,4.652406417112299

Modern touches are added with a band of girls whose gimmick is ""witchery"" with fangs and black lipstick-- but they're ""just eco-goths."" Yes, one character is Wiccan which is like saying one character is a Shaman. There is nothing cultish or evil to shield your young ones from. And no, I'm not a Wiccan.

I am a parent too, and although my own daughter is an infant, I'm very careful with what I allow her to watch and what I plan to let her watch in the future - this is one of those things I think she can certainly handle - simply explaining that Wiccans are peaceful healers who are in tune with the Earth's energies is not pushing children into the occult.  Wiccans aren't the witches of Bedknobs and Broomsticks, of Harry Potter or of any other children's book - education is the key - at least this video takes a step in that direction.

My only complaint is that this doesn't seem to have the superb organization, suspense, and shocks of ""Scooby Doo On Zombie Island."" As I said on my ""Scooby Doo on Zombie Island"" review, I admire Scooby's ability to create a scarey movie without sacrificing character development, without going way beyond the line of plausibility, and being able to create suspense and fear without extreme graphics.

As a parent, I was always comfortable that Scooby reinforced the message that there are no real monsters or ghosts.  My little ones always laughed at the silly ""bad guys"" who were just trying to scare the gang.  These new movies (Witches Ghost, Zombie Island) go against this entire philosophy.  The ghosts are real.  The zombies are real.  The witches are real.  It completely upset my kids who kept saying to me, ""But Scooby and the gang always show how the bad guys are just PRETENDING!""  It upset them and it upset me.  I know LOTS of moms that won't even allow their kids to watch these.

But otherwise, I find that this is classic  Scooby-Doo.  I didn't find this video to be excessively violent or too  scary for kids, especially considering that a lot of kids' animation such  as Dragonball Z and Pokemon is a lot more violent and scary than this.  I  was pleasantly surprised at the positive, though somewhat inaccurate,  depiction of Wicca; for example, one need not be an hereditary witch to be  Wiccan.  However, the overall positive view of Wicca far outweighs the  occasional goof on the writers' part.  I note that some parents were  disturbed by the fact that the movie even mentioned Wicca or witchcraft,  which is sad, because it shows we still have a long way to go before true  tolerance of non-Christian religion happens in American society.  It's sad  to think that there are still grown adults who haven't learned the lesson  of tolerance that an animated dog already knows.  Other than the fact that  Tim Curry makes a great villain (like we didn't already know that!) and the  fact that some of the monsters are ""real,"" the remainder of the  movie is very much like your typical Scooby-Doo episode, with Shaggy and  Scooby goofing around, Velma figuring things out, Fred being the action guy  and Daphne pretty much standing around being The Cute Girl.  The animation  is very fluid and fun to watch, and the supernatural scenes were spooky but  not excessively frightening, especially by comparison to the other animated  stuff that's out there that's allegedly for ""kids.""
