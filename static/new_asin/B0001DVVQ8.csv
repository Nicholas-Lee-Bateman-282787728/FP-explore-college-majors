8011010,4,B0001DVVQ8,"You don't hear Mouse McCoy's name much (unless you're in the film industry) but this guy is an incredible talent. When you're so fast on a bike and so gung-ho that you've got Ricky Johnson in your ear trying to back you down a little, that's impressive. Pretty heroic stuff from a guy who seems pretty normal, vs. the hot-shot, egomaniacal, Hollywood daredevil type.",1425686400,,366,4.734375
8011011,3,B0001DVVQ8,"Fun video if your an MX or off road racer but may not hold the interest of the casual viewer. Great old footage from the 60's showing some of the greats from the past then quickly moves to the here and now following a well known stuntman through the weekend. Interviews with riders young and old, famous and unknown. Some repetitiveness, lots of shots of unidentified bikes racing by. This is a once every two year viewing for me. Fun but nothing to bring me back over & over. If I had it to do over I'd still buy it but then I'm a MX'r and can't resist anything to do with Motocross.",1325462400,,584,4.176991150442478
8011012,1,B0001DVVQ8,"This turkey is NOT RECOMMENDED for children or ladies or anyone with a sense of propriety.  Profanity should have been edited out.  It was completely uncalled for, it ruined the entire production, and it only serves to reinforce the public's perception of bikers as foulmouthed louts.  This is a misnamed turkey; it's nothing about a day out riding in the dirt.  That would have been interesting, but only if produced by someone with editing talent.  What a disappointing DOG.",1211587200,,476,4.974683544303797
8011013,1,B0001DVVQ8,"If you're really, REALLY, into motorcross then this might be for you.  Supposedly follows Mouse McCoy the motorcycle legend and stuntman.  Well, McCoy dashes in and out of the movie but following him??  Nah, not really.  Movie covers five races during a Thanksgiving weekend that all look very very similar (ie on a dirt track).  You won't follow McCoy during the race (ie you won't know where he stands during the race).  Just a collection of motorcross shots and sloppy interviews due to poor questioning.  No onboard camera shots, no aerial shots.  Boring, boring, boring.  Boring",1177718400,4,583,4.989583333333333
8011014,5,B0001DVVQ8,"What if you could spend a weekend with dirt bike legends from several different decades and several types of racing, along with some movie stars, stuntment, and other folks you may have only read about... and what if you could actually get on a huge track and race around with them?  And what if the whole event was just for fun and there was NO money or prizes involved?  Once a year, an event just like this happens for real.

If you enjoyed On Any Sunday, or Dust to Glory, you owe it to yourself to check this little gem out.  I was skeptical since it's been out since 2002 and there was little or no buzz about it.  But this by FAR beats most of the ""moto"" hyped DVDs out there because it focuses on the people of the sport and industry and the relationships they have with each other, and the cameraderie they all share with each other young and old alike.

The pit bike racing is fun to watch, and it's great to see McGrath and RJ and Wardy again, along with multiple clips from On Any Sunday... Loved the team racing too.

If DVDs like Motocross Mayhem are your cup of tea, then this DVD will probably seem a little boring.  If you have to have blaring metal music with your dirt, then don't bother with this.  But if you love On Any Sunday and wish there were something like it but a little more current, then this is an hour and a half that you will enjoy.  Plus the soundtrack they use with it will not become dated in a few years.

Both my wife and I greatly enjoyed this and have even talked about finding out when the event is held every year and going to see it, and maybe even taking part in it.

Every dirt biker should have this in their DVD library.",1156464000,10,1668,4.161993769470405
