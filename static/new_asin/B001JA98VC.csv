8312184,5,B001JA98VC,"The Italian language version of A Summer's Tale is another Eric Rohmer winner, with the lovely Amanda Langlet playing opposite a very lucky Melvin Poupaud who seems to have the pick of the lovliest girls on the beach and who seems not to appreciate the enviable position in which he finds himself. A wistful love tale with great supporting acting and magnificent scenery, all assembled by the great Eric Rohmer. Enjoy.",1356480000,,418,4.901408450704225
