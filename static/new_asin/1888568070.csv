7800938,5,1888568070,Suspend all disbelief. Imaging your grandma wrote took everything she knew of hardened criminals and prison life and then wrote Escape From Alcatraz casting you and your high school band / drama buddies as violent convicts and hardy law enforcement.,1507852800,,249,5.25

7800942,4,1888568070,"This movie deals with issues of forgiveness and what it is like to have faith in Christ.  One theme of the Russ Doughten films -- there is always one character who embraces Christianity and another who rejects.

This is an exciting movie, though I feel it wasn't as good as several of the other movies, such as the Thief In The Night Series (the first three, at least) or ""Paradise Trail"".",1170115200,,389,4.464788732394366
7800943,4,1888568070,"This film is the second of the Mark IV films (A Thief in the Night was the first).
Set in Colorado, the film centers around two fugitives who have  just escaped from prison. The evil Jim Hawker, along with the reluctant aid  of Billy Hartman, sets out to flee the country, but not before plotting to  kill his ex-partner Robert Jameson, who has since married his ex-fiance  Karen. He happens to escape the day Jameson is released from prison for a  robbery.
To add to the complications, a cop named Buck, sets out to kill  Hawker, to avenge his wife's death. His bitterness does lead to tragic  results.
While Hawker is in fact a cold-blooded murderer, Hartman is  innocent. He had been set up for something he did not commit.
This movie  was good and fun to watch. A lot of scriptual passages come from Karen, who  found a relationship with God before Jameson was released. Hartman  remembers a lot of biblical passages that his mother taught him. During the  middle of the film, he gives his life to Christ.
Most of the filming took  place at the Royal George. I would recommend this film along with the  others by Mark IV pictures.",965088000,,1134,4.522167487684729
