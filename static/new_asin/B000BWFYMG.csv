8093500,4,B000BWFYMG,"I would recommend this DVD to those computer users who are really interested in learning the subject matter. The basic premise of the DVD is that it takes more than just buying backup software to understand and effectively backup. The DVD tests some major backup products and points out highlights and flaws in them. It also gets into the theory behind backups. I suppose I liked the DVD because it aligns with my own biases in this area. I also think software vendors completely oversimplify the backup process. Visual learners will like that the DVD is loaded with explanatory graphics, which makes the whole processes easier. The only complaint I had was that it sometimes looks like the presenters are looking off screen. Aside from that, its a very complete and professional presentation.",1134950400,,793,4.969924812030075
8093501,5,B000BWFYMG,"I have always been frustrated that most articles and books I have read on backup leave out an essential element...how to specifically do it. This DVD explained the concepts behind backup and then showed me how to do it with screencams. It came with two different backup software packages, so I was able to install them and then follow along on the DVD. Having created backups for what the DVD calls ""personal data"" and ""operating systems data"" I now feel like my data is protected. A word of warning, the DVD is quite thorough, and some people may not want all the detail in this DVD, but the menus are great, so I just went to the sections I liked. Some things the DVD discussed, like remote backup did not interest me, so I just skipped them.",1131321600,,744,4.437956204379562
