8182510,3,B000O17184,"STEVE REICH'S CITY LIFE is a documentary by Manfred Waffender that follows Steve Reich through the writing and concert performance of his 1995 piece ""City Life"" for small ensemble. The minimalist composer wanted to represent musically the feeling of living in New York, so he went all over the city with a tape recorder, capturing both sounds (""car horns, door slams, air brakes, subway chimes, pile drivers, car alarms, heartbeats, boat horns, buoys, and sirens"") and the speech of people talking in the street. In the last movement he incorporates police radio communications from the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

We see him engaged in this writing process as the documentary opens, feeding the recordings into a synthesizer memory bank so that they can be triggered by a keyboardist during performance. He talks a little bit about his upbringing and the changing city around him, though New York is represented more by wordless camera footage than by dialogue. As the documentary proceeds, Reich announces the piece finished and we witness him guiding the Ensemble Modern and conductor Sian Edwards through rehersals.

The piece is presented in full at the end of the work by the Ensemble Modern under Edwards. I've reevaluated Reich in recent years, finding more to like than I used to. However, I cannot say that this particular piece ranks among Reich's best work. The sampler technology is primitive, the third movement (the core of the work) is a too-sudden reversion to Reich's phasing techniques of the 1960s, offsetting the same vocal sample ""It's been a honeymoon"" played by the two keyboardists; this movement junks the more varied textures and exquisite details of Reich's later music, and it just goes on and on.

I assumed that ""City Life"" would seem dated and obnoxious to anyone. Imagine my shock and horror, then, to find from Reich's performance database that since it was premiered, this piece has been and continues to be performed several times a year. Oh well. If you actually like ""City Life"", or if you are a Reich completist, then this documentary may prove more attractive.",1353456000,,2106,5.02865329512894
8182511,3,B000O17184,"Those who know of Steve Reich and his music will find this DVD enlightening for a number of reasons:  We hear him interviewed, get a sense of how he creates his art, and see him interact with other musicians.  Steven Reich's music is easily accessible especially when compared with other ""modern"" composers (Cage, Boulez, Stockhausen, etc).
His techniques of phasing, repetition, gradual changes in chordal structure,with a steady rhymic foundation are well understood through this video.  ""City Life"" is the composition featured here and we see how he takes samples of common street sounds and enfolds them into the music.
One unusual moment comes when he describes sampling sounds from a New York City Fire Department during the ""World Trade Center Attack"".  When you remember that this DVD was made in 1996 you realize that this was not 9/11 but the first bombing of the WTC.",1208217600,4,878,4.993150684931507
