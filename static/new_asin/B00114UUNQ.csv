8240378,5,B00114UUNQ,"In this the final installment of the second season, Belldandy falls victim to heavens poor security, while Hild returns to give our heroine more competition than she can handle. Before all the dust settles, our man Keichii saves the day again through his simple honesty; a good deed is done for a lost soul; and our favorite goofball says those three little words to Belldandy, with (of course) more than a few unintended complications.
I put off watching these episodes for a long time, not wanting to see this ride end. I will miss the wonderful characters; fine animation; and near perfect voice casting. This particular example carries the standard high, right up to the end. The stories are sometimes difficult to watch, but the emotional pay off is more than worth it. The fact that the last episode ends on an up beat note is encouraging. My only regret in purchasing this dvd was that I waited so long to finish it.",1250121600,,923,4.668711656441718
8240379,3,B00114UUNQ,"Sadly, the show being release by ADV here, didn't get the rights to the actual last TWO episodes that would've capped it all off properly with the Lind arc before losing the rights completely and thereby losing the ability to continue it.",1218240000,,238,4.690476190476191
8240380,5,B00114UUNQ,"This disc had all the charm and humor that you've come to expect from AMG.  I seriously laughed out loud more than once, which is very rare for a romantic comedy.  I won't spoil anything, but I will say that the final episode of this season ended in a good way and there's still plenty of material from the manga that could easily be turned into a third season.  I know I can't wait for it.",1208131200,3,390,4.105263157894737
8240381,5,B00114UUNQ,"WELL HERE IS THE FINAL DISC OF THIS SEASON.
