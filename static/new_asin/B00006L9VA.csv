7971775,4,B00006L9VA,"good british film from 1960-Peter Sellers plays quite a nasty villian in this one, a real departure from his comedic roles. Not a particular masterpiece, but a good film that would be of interest to Peter Sellers' fans",1409097600,,218,4.7631578947368425
7971776,4,B00006L9VA,"A movie I remember as a teenager.  Probably the only movie where Peter Sellers plays a straight role as a bad guy. Perhaps this is Sellers true persona!  I also enjoyed seeing Adam Faith, who, although his singing wasn't the greatest, turned out later to be a very good actor.  A great trip down memory lane.",1356912000,,308,4.464285714285714
7971777,1,B00006L9VA,"I was verry unhappy with the product, seller, and all of it.  I was new to buuing in line, and didnot understand about the code to let it play in U.S.  I still feel it was a costly way to learn.  I still havn't found the movies i wanted, I was diaapointed with the processing time from outside the U.S. HSP",1340236800,,306,3.9836065573770494
7971778,4,B00006L9VA,"Set in the early 60s and barely remembered (if at all) as Peter Sellers' singular venture into ""serious"" acting, NEVER LET GO has a lot of deliciously lurid elements to recommend it -- the movie got an X-rating when it was released!  Twisted and demented, the story is determinedly melodrama as it tracks the inexorable collision course as two desperate, obsessive men meet head-on in a bizarre feud.  Meek Richard Todd is a sales rep for Peter Jones's cosmetics firm.  His life is turned upside down when Adam Faith steals his car.  Sellers is a smiley-faced small-time crook who manages a legit garage that's a front for the car thieves.  He's also a sugar daddy to teen tart Carol White.  The story follows Todd's relentless efforts to get his car back - efforts that unhinge the ruthless, cold-hearted Sellers.  Too bad he didn't do more films in which he could play villains.",1299715200,2,880,4.75
7971779,4,B00006L9VA,"""Never Let Go"" from 1960, is a moody black and white piece starring Peter Sellers as head of a car theiving operation and Richard Todd, as the unlucky salesman who wants his car back.  Peter Sellers isn't bad as a villain in this movie and I quickly got accustomed to him outside his usual comic role. Richard Todd plays a beleivable and sypathetic victim who we're rooting for all the way, despite his caring but unsupportive wife.  Getting his car back becomes a mission of self-respect for salesman John Cummings (Richard Todd) who loses his job in the course of events making getting his car back all the more important.

The early 60s is kind of a distinct period for films from the few I've seen.  Hitchcocks ""Psycho"" came out that year and so did the Twilight Zone.. Paul Newman's ""The Hustler"" in '61.. Maybe it's the just the black and white, or the cinematograpy.  Or is it the styles and edgier themes?  Another very good movie which I saw recently from this period (1962) was ""Walk on the Wild Side"" with a beautiful Jane Fonda and Laurence Harvey.  I'm getting off track.. sorry.  I liked this movie.  Richard Todd's persistence was inspiring.  And it felt somewhat historical seeing Peter Sellers in a role like this.",1204156800,4,1231,4.657407407407407
7971780,4,B00006L9VA,"This is a gritty and grim British film noir that shows a very different side of the great Peter Sellers.

In a rare dramatic role, he is a ruthless and sadistic leader of a gang of car thieves. Filmed in atmospheric black and white with a jazz score (by John Barry), this is definitely a must see for fans of the genre and Sellers.

By all accounts, Sellers was a genius, but also a strange man who inhabited his characters and stayed in persona even when the director called ""Cut!""

He also brought his work home with him. I read in a biography that his wife was very happy when this movie wrapped production! When you see his performance, you'll understand why.",1119398400,14,663,4.418032786885246
7971781,3,B00006L9VA,"Despite the seedy London locales and the jazzy score by John Barry this tale of a down-on-his-luck cosmetics salesman who gets his car pinched by a gang of car thieves is overbaked melodrama.  As the film progresses it just gets sillier and sillier.  Peter Sellers, to let us know that he is ""acting"", chews whatever scenery is handy.  He glowers, he emotes, he launches spittle.  Recommended only for camp value or Sellers completists.",1118361600,6,436,4.931506849315069
