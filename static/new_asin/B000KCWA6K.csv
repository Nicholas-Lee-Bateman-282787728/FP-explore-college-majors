2688118,5,B000KCWA6K,"I had seen the movie, which was excellent. I wanted to also know the historical facts. This DVD was all I'd hoped for. Would recommend to anyone wanting more facts.",1390003200,,164,4.5
2688119,5,B000KCWA6K,IF YOU WANT TO KNOW HOW THE JUES BELIEVED ABOUT THEIR FAITH AND WERE WELLING TO DIE FOR WHAT THEY BELIVED IN THIS WHAT CHRISTIONS ALSO DID WHEN THEY BELIEVD IN JESUS.,1365984000,,166,4.21875
2688120,5,B000KCWA6K,"This DVD covers a number of different aspects of the siege against Masada than we usually see or read about. Artifacts including rings, necklaces, pottery, pottery sherds with names, arrowheads, and stones that may have been catapulted at the rebels during the siege are shown. Expanding from the topic of Masada though, it also gives a fairly detailed accounting of the siege against the rebels holding the city of Jerusalem. Several fascinating theories are included about what really happened with Josephus. Exactly what did he do to make his fellow Jews hate him? Was he a traitor, or did he try to negotiate a better ending in Jerusalem? Since we depend on the writing of Josephus for our understanding of what happened at Masada, did he write it accurately, or was it flavored to make him look better to his Roman masters? Archeological findings are helping solve some of these mysteries.

I seem to learn something unique from each book, article and video/movie about Masada. This one started out with more information on the Sicari rebels than most. It also talks about Herod a little more, even giving more detail about how he actually would have used the palace he built at Masada. One source said Herod never stayed there. The others haven't said that. This one went on the assumption that he did use it, although he never had to use it as the fortress it was built to be. It's strange to imagine that after putting all that extraordinary effort into building the palaces there, that he wouldn't have used them. He was said to have been afraid that Cleopatra's new husband, Marc Antony might decide to attack and 'give' Masada to Cleopatra for a wedding present. This version says that Herod and Cleopatra had previously had some kind of relationship, so Herod would have had good reason to be a little nervous.

There is a better computerized picture than most other sources of what the three-tiered palace would have looked like and how it would have been used, some of it a little amusing.

Expect a surprising ending. There's a discussion of what we know vs. what is speculative, the evidence for and against the traditional ending, and finally, why what we may have always heard may not actually have been the way it happened. The introduction of new information made me want to argue back at times. You'll probably be exposed to some new ideas on this topic, whether you agree with them or not.

I very much disagreed with the Harvard professor interviewed who said that our interest in Masada is the same kind of morbid interest that we have about the Jonesboro massacre. If one has to compare it to something it might be closer to the Alamo, but still vastly different. There is really no appropriate comparison.

My own interest (not expertise) is in history and archeology, particularly Beersheva and, of course, Qumran. Masada is a special situation. It's a fairly controlled, concise area where archeologists have some facts about what happened. It's interesting to compare those facts with the archeological findings. The events that took place at Masada also help to fill in some of the 'rest of the story' following the destruction of Jerusalem by the Romans.

This video does include subtitles in several different languages, including English, French, Russian, and Hebrew, Spanish, and German. They are a little annoying because they are large and block the names and credentials of the speakers being interviewed. I may go back later and practice reading Hebrew using them though. They may be ideal for that.",1326326400,10,3537,4.867109634551495
2688121,1,B000KCWA6K,"I purchased this specifically because I thought I was getting the movie on DVD. I'm the library minister at my Messianic Jewish congregation and this is a very popular title in our movie collection, and I was so excited to have found a DVD version of it. But when the movie arrived this weekend it was the VHS version. This is very dishonest to advertise as a DVD version, and even add that it's Region 1, which is a DVD specification (VHS tapes aren't region encoded) when in fact the product being sold is a VHS tape.

My one-star rating is directed entirely at the seller of this item, not at the movie itself. ""Masada"" is an amazing true story and I would give this 4 or 5 stars if it had indeed been on DVD as promised.",1314576000,28,724,4.246376811594203

2688132,5,B000KCWA6K,"This is a review of the 2015 version of the DVD of Masada. I also own the 2007 version DVD, the complete miniseries on VHS and the short movie version on VHS. If only they would release the thing on Blu-ray! Maybe add some stuff that got cut from the broadcast version--there is some stuff which I will not go into, stuff that was refilmed for TV but worked better in the story as it was originally meant to be. Suffice it to say that Barbara Carrera is a lovely woman. Oh, well, you will not get that very short scene on any version of the complete miniseries, only in the ""movie"", which chopped over six hours down to about two or less, and only on VHS, if you can even find it. Well, enough of that.

Masada has now been released twice on DVD, in 2007 and now this one in 2015. Or has it? One previous reviewer says this is a bad transfer, while the 2007 version is great. I'm not sure how anyone could come to such a conclusion because--surprise!--the DVDs are identical. Absolutely identical. All the pictures, all the words, all the numbers on each of the DVDs are absolutely identical. You get the very same DVDs with either set. Only the cover of the case is different. As of right this minute, the 2007 version is selling for 66 dollars more than the 2015 version. Keep your money. Buy the 2015 version. They are the exact same transfers on the exact same DVDs. The older cover is prettier, but not 66 dollars prettier. Get the 2015 version, especially if the price stays so outrageously different between the two. Just in case anyone wants to tell you otherwise, I have included pictures.",1499558400,11,1598,4.398648648648648

2688152,5,B000KCWA6K,"My wife and I loved this mini series.  There is not a lot of action in it, it is all character driven.  It is in four parts and overall is very long.  But it was enjoyable to watch.

Peter O'Toole often makes faces that I find out of place or just ridiculous looking; but his delivery of his lines is epic.

Peter Strauss was wonderful to watch as well.  Their one on ones are great parts of this mini series.

We found the characters easy to like and sympathize with and invested in the outcome of the story.",1472515200,2,509,4.13265306122449

2688165,1,B000KCWA6K,"This isn't a review of the film/mini-series which is excellent. It's an expose of this particular 2015 so-called ""collector's edition"". There is nothing collectible about this. It is inferior in every way to the 2007 Koch Entertainment version. This is made from a very poor, filthy, flat tape of the film. The color is terrible, the sound is not up to the quality of the former release. The older release costs a bit more but go for it. This crap isn't worth having.",1456876800,30,467,4.63855421686747
2688166,3,B000KCWA6K,"Overall, I enjoyed it. It's not cut to ribbons as is the case with previous releases, and has all the scenes. There is a flaw in Disc 2 where a small, but significant piece of dialog is inexplicably missing - kind of disconcerting when it happens. I'm sure it's a glitch on the disc and not planned. But, still good to see the whole thing with only that one missing few seconds.",1456617600,2,378,4.263888888888889

2688169,5,B000KCWA6K,"In the month of December of 2015 I was able to be at Masada on two occasions with, Nirit Greenberg of Haifa and Rami Salfiti of Jerusalem, excellent Israeli guides who were very knowledgeable on the Jewish rebellion of 66 AD and the aftermath.  Also of this event on various Jewish Sects who escaped to this Herod The Great mountain hill top which was thought impregnable. This made for television mini series was filmed on location with much of the film shot on the western slope of Masada and the rest on the top.  The Judean Desert and the Dead Sea as backdrops lent a unique perspective to this story.

Watching the film I thought I got into a time capsule and was brought back to 70 AD.  Peter Strauss's powerful portrait of Jewish leader Eleazer ben Yair reflects the passion and ingenuity of the character and sets all the Jewish cast on a very high performance plane.  This provides a glimpse into the mindset of the various sects of the Zealots and the Essenes who interact on grounded historical information.

After witnessing and studying the siege ramp the Romans constructed, still present, the film provides the process for its construction and colossal understanding.  Additionally, the psych-ops used by both sides is very much appreciate especially on the rebel side with the use of the copious water tool.  The only criticism I have is the use of Anglo-Saxon actors with strong British accents to represent small brown Roman soldiers.  Otherwise, my appreciation and respect for the Jewish People is mightily enhanced by the watching of this powerful film.",1454889600,5,1574,4.843283582089552

2688173,5,B000KCWA6K,I remember this mini series as a kid and thought it was interesting mostly from a historical viewpoint. It is still an intriguing  series and worth the investment . I recommend this along with the Dove keepers  as a companion . Highly recommended.,1443571200,,247,4.72093023255814
8155613,3,B000KCWA6K,"A wonderfully made epic with masterful acting by Peter O'Toole and an incredible music score by Jerry Goldsmith. My rating is an average 3 stars, because the miniseries is 5 stars but the DVD is 1 star.

  Firstly, let me be clear on Masada's format history; In 1981 Masada aired on network TV as a 4-part miniseries and was also released internationally as a feature film, shortened in length with alternate scenes. Both cuts have their own aspects that are worth viewing.

  The feature film version was released in 1990 on MCA/Universal VHS. Awful quality but nice to have this version, it still doesn't exist on DVD. The full 4-part miniseries wasn't released until 1997 in a MCA/Universal VHS box set. That was the best ever release of Masada in terms of quality. The full, uncut miniseries with digitally mastered picture and sound.

  Since then it has been all downhill. In 2007, KOCH got us excited about their DVD release of the Masada miniseries, which you would expect to be an improvement in quality. However, not only was the mastering a downgrade from the VHS, it contained a glitch that omitted dialogue from a scene in Part 4. They never corrected the mistake or offered any replacement discs.

  Now Sony has offered us a 2016 ""Collector's Edition"" DVD, getting our hopes up once again. However as it turns out, these are the exact same discs as the 2007 KOCH release. Same bad mastering, same omitted dialogue. The only difference is the cover art on the case!

  In 2011, Intrada gave us a glorious release of the Masada soundtrack on 2-disc CD. Why can't someone to do an equally serious mastering of this wonderful miniseries (and movie) on DVD or Blu-ray? Until then, if you still have a VCR, I actually recommend the 4-tape VHS set. Seriously.

  It's ironic that one of the missing lines from this glitchy DVD is O'Toole shouting ""Burn it!"" because that's exactly what should be done with this set. Take it back and try it again guys.",1526256000,,1959,4.6950146627565985
