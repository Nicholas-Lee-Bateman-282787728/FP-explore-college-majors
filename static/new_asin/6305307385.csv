8315306,5,6305307385,"My son is three and really likes these tapes.  Some of the information is a bit advanced, but the videos are well written and he learns a lot by watching the pictures.  We watched the Astronaut tape probably 25 times after we got the set before he wanted to watch another one.  There are seven tapes with two episodes/careers on each tape.  And the scripts are not hokey or silly.  They're serious, but fun to watch.  It's easy to watch these with my son without counting the minutes until it's over like some other tapes we have.  I definately recommend this set.",1065744000,4,564,4.470588235294118
8315307,5,6305307385,My nephew can't stop watching these! He's worn them out. A good investment for any family with children under the age of eight that you would like to keep glued to the set. Very informative and educational-interesting even to adults! I highly reccommend!,1038614400,6,254,4.930232558139535
