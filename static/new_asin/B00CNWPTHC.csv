8583824,5,B00CNWPTHC,"'Silent Holy Stones', a film by Pema Tseden

'Silent Holy Stones', the debut feature by Tibetan director, Pema Tseden, was
shot on location in the Tibetan region of Amdo (in what is today part of China's
Qinghai Province) in 2004. It was the first ever Tibetan language movie to have
been filmed in Tibet and the first to feature an entirely Tibetan cast.

Shot in and around Guwa Monastery, in the area where the director was born
and raised, 'Silent Holy Stones' narrates the tale of a young monk's obsession
with watching a popular television series - an adaptation of the Chinese
Buddhist classic, 'Journey to the West' - and his efforts to bring a television back
to the monastery to allow his teacher to watch it with him.

Television: we've all grown up with it, no doubt we all take it for granted,
ubiquitous object in all our living rooms. Yet there are still parts of the world
where possession of a telly is something to aspire to, a status symbol that
represents all that is modern and most desirable. Indeed, in Pema Tseden's
film the television set is admired, fingered, stroked, almost as if it were a fetish
object in itself. In its own way it plays a more central role in the movie than any
of the human characters.

Not only the TV set, but other every-day modern items such as motorbikes,
music systems, even children's sweets and a toy monkey mask take on
distinctive roles. Familiar yet at the same time not so, they stand out in
curiously sharp relief, as if their very foreignness were somehow accentuated
by the purely Tibetan backdrop of the film. In fact, it is this stark contrast that
forces us into an awareness of both the strength and durability of native
Tibetan culture and traditions and the ways in which these traditions are being
subtly undermined by modernisation. These changes may partly reflect China's
colonial presence and policies in Tibet; they are also the more universal
consequence of challenges which face traditional societies all over the world.

Indeed what makes Pema Tseden unique as a chronicler of contemporary Tibet
is the non-judgemental manner in which he juxtaposes the traditional and the
novel. After all, the notion that they are losing their culture almost certainly
never occurs to Tibetans when they load a VCD into their player or turn on the
telly. The effects of this may be comical (even farcial) as when a performance
of the traditional Tibetan opera, 'Drime Kunden', staged to celebrate new year,
finishes only to be immediately replaced by a makeshift disco where the
performers dance raucously to the loud thump of Tibetan techno. However,
both the opera and the disco are presented as simple facts of contemporary
Tibetan life. There is no suggestion we assign a greater value to one than the
other.

At other moments the tone of the film is more elegiac, the fragility and
vulnerability of manners and customs that have endured for generations feels
almost palpable. The death at the end of the film of an old man who lives alone
in the mountains chiselling Buddhist mantras into stone as an act of piety could
almost serve as metaphor for the passing into history of a now obsolete way of
life.

'Silent Holy Stones', like the director's two subsequent films, 'The Search' and 'Old
Dog', portrays Tibet as a contemporary, evolving (at times rapidly evolving)
culture. This places his work in deliberate contrast to much Western (and
indeed Tibetan) writing and film making on Tibet which suffers from a
tendency to romanticize the country and its people, transforming it into a
fairytale land of monks and nuns realizing profound truths in picture-postcard
monasteries high in the mountains -- think Brad Pitt in Seven Years in Tibet.

Such myth making comes at a cost, however, for it denies Tibetans the
fundamental right to be normal - after all, to mythologize is ultimately to
dehumanize. Indeed Pema Tseden's Tibet is not a land of soaring peaks and
picturesque monasteries. It is a land of stark brown hills and squat featureless
one-storey houses. But, it is just this authenticity of setting which allows us a
window through which to observe the challenges faced by a deeply traditional
society as it grapples with the consequences of radical and irreversible change.",1417651200,5,4254,4.857931034482759
8583825,5,B00CNWPTHC,"I found this film stunning! First saw it at a festival and have been waiting forever to get my own copy to show friends who think there are no Tibetans left in Tibet. Not only are there millions of people, but among them has emerged a sensitive artistic ""voice"" that draws us into the feelings of Tibetan people with compassion and humor and without overly sentimental or exaggerated exoticism.  Took my breath away.  Have also discovered that the director - Pema Tseden from Amdo (Qinghai) - is an author, writing in Tibetan and Chinese and that translations of his works are beginning to appear in several countries (not yet in the U.S). As I read Chinese I've been able to read a few short stories of his that I found (with some difficulty) on Chinese language Internet sites.  The stories were as fresh and original as his films. (See also his film, Old Dog, a recent award winner. Very different tone than this one. And there is another that will hopefully be available from Amazon eventually, The Search.) Can't wait for more from him! Can't wait to see where he will go artistically.
