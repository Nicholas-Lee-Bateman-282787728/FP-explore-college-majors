7999126,1,B0000CEB4T,"AWFUL. I'm a big fan of Psychomania and expected something like a C level MST3K but this ""Laugh Track"" crap is the worst. If you like your old 70's horror movies ruined by ""Gangsta"" talking smartasses with pop culture references from 2003 throw in then you might not vomit watching this. The ONLY good thing about this dvd is that you can watch Psychomania as it was intended to be seen with no overdubbed s***e. AVOID",1369872000,,418,4.5131578947368425
