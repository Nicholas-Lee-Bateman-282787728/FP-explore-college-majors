8476996,4,B005KMUNXC,"Penguindrum begins somewhat ominously, with the narrator explaining that ""after that day, we only knew we would never amount to anything.""  Two brothers, Kanba and Shoma, are shocked when their sister, Himari, collapses at a local aquarium.  Upon being rushed to the hospital, she is pronounced dead.  A moving scene follows with one of the brothers begging the doctor to ""save her,"" and the doctor reminding him that medicine is not magic.  As the brothers grieve together beside her dead body, Himari sits up in bed and proclaims ""Survival Strategy!""  And thus a very strange anime begins.

Penguindrum is, on the whole, a mystery--and an intriguing one at that.  Without spoiling anything else, I can say that the plot is much more interesting than the characters, though personalities are shaded in enough that we do care somewhat what happens to Shoma, Kanba, Ringo, Himari, and the rest.  What Penguindrum lacks in character development, however, it makes up for in delicious oddity and a sort of charming peversity that make it well-worth a watch.

My concerns with the show were only a few, though they did detract significantly from my overall enjoyment.  The first was the overdramatic fight scenes.  There is, much later in the series, a fight scene between two female characters that is way too choreographed and ""martial artsy"" for the characters themselves, who are never explained to have such abilities.  That one battle threw a nasty wrench into my previously very high appreciation for the show.  Tagged onto this is the brothers' ridiculous ability to absorb life-threatening, bone-crunching, tendon-ripping damage.  In this regard, the show starts to become a bit silly.  Some will notice and not mind, and others will dislike it and find it annoying.  I am of the latter camp.

My second concern (and many mystery shows run into this problem) was the ending--which I will not spoil.  I will however say that this particular kind of ending has been done many times before, and wasn't revelatory enough to meet the high standard PD's plot sets for itself.  The journey was amazing, but the destination was mediocre and hackneyed.  With a slice-of-life, this can be forgivable, as there are many other elements to balance such a show out.  With a mystery, however, the ending becomes crucial to one's appreciation of the show.  We watch mysteries to see what will happen next, to know what the secret is, to find out who shot JR, etc.  When the big reveal is a letdown, the integrity of the show itself is damaged.

Bottom line--watch MPD and enjoy it.  Try to ignore some of the silliness and inconsistency in characters, for they live to drive the plot.  If you must, shake your head over the ending.  Then watch some of the other great shows of 2011--Madoka, AnoHana, Hanairo, etc--and compare.",1336780800,,2815,4.93404255319149
8476997,4,B005KMUNXC,"This delightful distraction from reality should be rated for those 16 or 17+. But,not for the price mentioned as it is available elsewhere for about 1/3 this cost. When you put a 1 micron thick rubber coating on a nude female,ALL over her body and the artists learned well female anatomy,this version would have to be gutted to get it to PG-13 and,as it is from the same region as mine,I don't think they did that to the version being offered here. There are things done in this series I have almost never seen before. If you got the bread to pay this price I am sure he will thank you for it.",1334361600,,593,4.256637168141593
