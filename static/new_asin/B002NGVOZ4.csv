8375046,5,B002NGVOZ4,"I bought this DVD because I was looking for something that I could do on my own.  This two part program is easy to follow along at home and it is gentle enough for any age. In a voice that is soothing and relaxing, Ms. Balin demonstrates and explains the technique for each pose. The deep relaxation is a perfect way to end your yoga session and should not be missed.",1253318400,,367,4.169014084507042
8375047,5,B002NGVOZ4,"If you are looking for a yoga program that integrates gentle, yet effective stretching and Hatha yoga poses with positive empowerment and relaxation, look no further!  I purchased ""Yoga For Heath Defense"" when it was originally released, over 10 years ago, and have been enjoying it ever since on a regular weekly basis.  Rochelle Balin herself guides you through two completely different Hatha yoga programs on this disc, each one concluding with its own unique guided mediation.  The Phase One program is a gentle yoga program that incorporates stretches with Hatha yoga poses that are simple yet effective, while the Phase Two program presents some of the gentle stretches and poses used in the first program with more challenging poses such as the Bow and Cobra.  Each program culminates in its own restorative yet empowering deep relaxation, expertly guided by the soothing voice of Ms. Balin.  She can literally whisk you away to a more peaceful and harmonious universe with just her voice!  Unlike most yoga DVDs out there, this is yoga that offers MORE than just exercise.  Although your body will get a full, low impact workout, this particular style of yoga, as offered only by Rochelle Balin, really takes you to another level.  The yoga itself is the kind that embraces you, whoever you may be, as well as your abilities, whatever they may be.  The positive vibes here are just the icing on the cake of this remarkable DVD-it's yoga for the ages (and ageless)!",1252022400,,1472,4.903225806451613
