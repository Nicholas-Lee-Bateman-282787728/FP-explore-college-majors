5408578,5,B00AB2NZ40,"Good, clean transfer of the film-looks great on my big screen tv. Would not hesitate to buy other ""on demand"" titles.  Nice quality packaging and film transfer.  So glad to be able to own a copy of this Clifton Webb classic.",1356739200,2,224,4.439024390243903
5408579,4,B00AB2NZ40,"Clifton Webb is as wonderful and funny and sarcastic as ever. Paired with the Delightful Ginger Rogers, it is a hilarious trip back to the days of silent movies. Typical Clifton Webb film and a wonderful surprise ending. One of his best.",1355529600,16,237,4.666666666666667

5408583,4,B00AB2NZ40,"Quick observations about ""Dreamboat"" (1952).

Anne Francis never looked sexier than in this film,  in the part of a repressed ""professor's daughter"",  with minimal make-up and glasses; the geek girl look really suited her.  The funniest scene is the animated hair tonic commercial, the characters are virtually identical to the current ""Cricket Wireless"" stuff - nicely illustrating that advertising has changed very little since 1952.

Elsa Lanchester was wonderful as the on-the-make college president, her scenes are priceless comedy.  Clifton Webb did his standard put-upon sophisticate, in fact they simply use a clip of him playing Mr. Belvedere in ""Sitting Pretty"" (1948) for the screening of Bruce Blair's first modern film.

Then again, what do I know?  I'm only a child.",1418688000,4,780,5.3884297520661155

5408585,5,B00AB2NZ40,"Love this movie. Ginger isn't the main person in it, but boy does she light up the screen when she appears. And she is sexy in this film like no other movie she has starred in before. Beautiful as ever in a more mature way, she glides in and out with such elegance and aplomb you wait for her  to reappears with impatience. All in all this is an entertaining film, just cannot for the life of me imagine Clifton Webb ever attracting Ginger's eye in their younger days as the characters they portray. One to watch for Ginger, Clifton Webb's dry sense of humour and the quirkiness of it all.",1409616000,2,589,4.306306306306307
5408586,4,B00AB2NZ40,"Clifton Webb is in top form in this delightful comedy about a school teacher and former heart throb silent actor whose past finally catches up with him. Like all Webb films, you will enjoy watching this one time and time again. Not a Mr Belvedere film, but just as good. BUY IT, YOU WON'T BE SORRY.",1409270400,,298,4.339285714285714
5408587,5,B00AB2NZ40,This movie was ok.  I like other Clifton Webb movies better than this one.,1408060800,,74,4.285714285714286
5408588,5,B00AB2NZ40,"Clifton Webb is fully himself in this little comedy. His facial expressions and movements are classic. Although the story could use a bit of work, I love to see Webb perform anytime any where.",1404864000,,192,4.676470588235294
5408589,4,B00AB2NZ40,"An English professor (Clifton Webb) finds his quiet life turned upside down when his secret past is revealed. When a series of silent movies is shown on television, his former career as a romantic leading man in silent films is exposed. Resentful of the unwanted publicity and intrustion into his private life, he and his daughter (Anne Francis) go to New York to threaten to sue to keep the films off television. If you can buy the idea of Clifton Webb as a dashing 1920s heartthrob a la Valentino, this pleasant if minor comedy is quite agreeable and moves along nicely except for a rather sluggish court sequence toward the end of the film. It shoots some rather vicious arrows at the vapidness of television (circa 1952) but seems rather impervious to its own rather condescending view of silent cinema. Ginger Rogers is quite good as Webb's former leading lady, now hawking perfume on TV. There's an inconsequential subplot involving Francis as Webb's bookish daughter and her romance with a New York public relations man (Jeffrey Hunter). Directed by Claude Binyon. With Elsa Lanchester, Fred Clark, Helene Stanley, Ray Collins, Marietta Canty and Gwen Verdon.

The MOD DVDr courtesy of Fox is a decent B&W transfer in the appropriate 1.37 aspect ratio.",1387670400,5,1259,4.938679245283019
5408590,4,B00AB2NZ40,"This is a truly enjoyable movie.  Clifton Webb is his acidic self, Ginger Rogers is great and the dialog is vintage ""Mr. Belvedere"" at his best.  A little dated now but still enjoyable",1376265600,,184,4.545454545454546
5408591,5,B00AB2NZ40,"This movie is some kind of fun.  I loved CClifton Webb in Laura and bought this film to have more of him.
I was not disappointed.  He is a totally different character without losing the edge that made him so brilliant.",1366675200,,218,4.2926829268292686
5408592,5,B00AB2NZ40,"this movie is from a time when movies were good clean fun ,nothing to offend any one just a nice way to spend  an afternoon , but in this one you get ginger rogers and clifton webb so sure to be a great show nothing to strain the brain  but very enjoyable",1363651200,6,255,3.8846153846153846
5408593,5,B00AB2NZ40,"A must for all Clifton Webb and classic movie fans.  A wonderful comedy featuring Webb's droll wit as the ""iron-hearted"" college professor who is outed as a former matinee movie star. Excellent performances by former Hollywood greats Ginger Rogers and Anne Francis. Wonderful for an evening of lighthearted entertainment.",1361577600,9,321,5.551020408163265

5408596,3,B00AB2NZ40,"Dreamboat is a lighthearted vehicle that gives Clifton Webb an ample opportunity to display his talents for sardonic wit, superior acting, and even a little acrobatics. Expect a thoroughly enjoyable interlude while watching it. For Webb lovers, the King of Hauteur does not disappoint.",1360368000,2,285,5.5
5408597,4,B00AB2NZ40,"When 'Deam Boat' first appeared, it was a riot, because the entire use of lampooning of silent films had not yet been exhausted... it certainly was before Carol Burnett knew how to do it with the aplomb.  Still, Dream Boat remains somewhat fresh and enjoyable, with a miscast Clifton Webb overriding his persona to give a deft performance a  la the Belvedere films.  And Ginger Rogers, in a smaller role, is showy and knows, at least  here, how to handle a funny situation.  The secondary love story of Anne Francis and Jeffrey Hunter does not work, but both look good..and one enjoys the young Francis gaining the experience that turned her into a first-rate actress who  has not received her due.  Some elements of the plot are stretched too far, but Elsa Lanchester knows how to take a silly role and turn it into something enjoyable.  Film is still worth looking at, although my memory of laughing hard is now a thing in the past.",1357257600,11,934,4.618181818181818
5408598,5,B00AB2NZ40,"Clifton Webb is at his best as a college Prof. who discovers they are putting on silent films he played in 20 years before with Ginger Rogers. It's a film that pokes a bit of fun at TV and silent films and is delightful from start to end. If you're a Clifton Webb fan, then add this film to your collection. You will laugh all the way.",1356825600,21,335,4.014925373134329
5408599,5,B00AB2NZ40,"Saw this one years ago on AMC when they were showing classics.  Very funny film with good performances by Webb and Ginger Rogers.  This MOD FOX release looks pretty good. However, the FOX's MOD quality vary from film to film. I have heard many complaints about their other releases including EVERYBODY DOES IT.  Highly recommended.",1356739200,2,331,4.9818181818181815

8549649,4,B00AB2NZ40,"Typical but engaging 50s comedy. Clifton Webb plays the same role in most of his films, but he does it so well. His pairing with Ginger Rogers in this film makes it particularly interesting. Elsa Lanchester plays her comedic role with flair, and Anne Francis adds beauty and a solid performance to the film.  Nothing to make you think or stretch your imagination, but fun, fluffy entertainment. Well worth watching.",1465084800,,415,4.928571428571429
