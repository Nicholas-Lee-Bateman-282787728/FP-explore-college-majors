8039088,2,B00062IYQO,"This movie was originally shot in Volker Park in Kansas City Missouri in 1972.  It features Michael Moriarty, Paul Sorvino & Buck Buchanan (of the CHIEFS).  I play one of the ""hippies"" harrassing Officer Moriarty at the beginning of the movie.  If you're a fan of my work you'll enjoy my first big screen appearance.  Otherwise, this is a mundane & tired script about a wrongly accused ""HIP"" cop.",1146441600,,396,4.695652173913044
