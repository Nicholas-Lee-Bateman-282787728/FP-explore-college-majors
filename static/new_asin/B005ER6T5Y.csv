Nat Adderley who wrote Work Song, sings, this,  is a departure for most musicians of his ilk. But having him play this piece on other DVDs, I appreciated this rare occurrence.  In my opinion, Work Song is among the greatest of Bop hits in the history of jazz. I have worked outside, inspired by the sound of this tune. I would include Work Song with tunes like Blue Trane, Moanin'  The Panther, Cantaloupe Island, Song For My Father, well I could go on, but if you know the music, you get what I'm saying. With an all star crew led by Benny Carter, how could you go wrong.
The song list is: Stockholm Riff, Here's That Rainy Day, Work Song, Just Friends, Lover Man, & What's Is This Thing Called Love. I grant you, a fleeting 34 minutes, but you can never replace this moment in time.",1439942400,,948,4.314606741573034
