8095889,3,B000C6NOXC,"What there is in this film is good. Some of it very good. But most of it is pretty superficial. No indepth info is given on his life in Turkey or his subsequent torture of Turks and all ""Sinners"" in his own country. He didn't just impail people, he tortured them like the turks did, which is where he learned his governing techniques.",1359331200,,334,4.317460317460317
8095890,1,B000C6NOXC,"Worst movie ever. If you think Vlad is good or evil, you will hate this. This movie is poorly made and it has a lot of inaccurate facts.  The narrator claims that the Impaler was stabbed to death by a member of his court while he slept in his castle. In fact, Dracula was beheaded in 1476 by a Turkish assassin during a battle near the monastery of Snagov where he was eventually buried.  The narrator also downplays Dracula's recorded cruelty by altering the historical description of battles in order to make them appear less gruesome.  And the narrator says that Vlad's father was known as Vlad ""The Evil"" but he was known as ""the Dragon"".  And for the first 20 to 25 minutes, the narrator describes a castle that the documentarian himself says is only fictitiously connected to Vlad.  I do not recommend this movie to anyone.",1296345600,5,829,4.574324324324325
8095891,4,B000C6NOXC,"I rented this dvd from a local library, and was expecting less, and instead found it very watchable and detailed.

The producer/author of the DVD clearly went to seek the truth behind the ledgend. If you want a flashy hollywood production, this isn't the purchase for you. However, if you want a logical, historical perspective on the man that was later deemed 'Dracula' this is a great documentary.

I believe the intent of the movie to spend time, at the beginning, reviewing and discussing the mis-associated Bram castle, is to get it out of the way and clear your mind for the upcoming facts known about Vlad the Impaler.

I'm surprised that anyone who is interested in the truth found this dvd to fail them. It's presented logically (which is always rare), calmly, with a great voice-over, and most-importantly - it is presented scientifically and with historical accuracy -- three things that make it a pleasure to watch.

The producer goes to the location himself, which alone shows the passion of the subject.

I cannot overstate how logically Vlad the Impaler's life is presented.

True, much of the documentary doesn't discuss Bram Stoker's, ultimately, mixed-up geographical ledgend/myth story of 'Dracula' in relation to Vlad the Impaler - but, then, that is the entire point of the DVD: to illuminate the truth of Vlad the Impaler's true history.

I found it facinating and enlightening, and Vlad is every bit as interesting as Dracula himself. The production value is very modest, but the reasoning and presentation of the facts, and the mood of the dvd made me feel as if I not only, at long last, heard some or much of the truth regarding the subject, but that I was not steered in any one direction, morally, to make a final judgement. In fact if anything, Vlad was quite the ruler. A highly intelligent, military leader and person who lived his life absolutely based on his convictions.

Much enjoyed and much thanks to the creators for not taking the easy way out and making all kinds of ridiculous suppositions based, once again, on the long confused myth.

Well-done.",1239667200,7,2088,4.842696629213483
8095892,3,B000C6NOXC,"I bought this DVD to show to my high school students, who are reading Bram Stoker's Dracula.  After looking at various websites on Vlad Tepes, they were really anxious to learn more about the real Dracula. One of their biggest complaints was how much time in the video's beginning was devoted to Dracula's castle, which actually was never Vlad's castle at all.  The rest is interesting, but is told in a very dry manner.  I understand it's a documentary, but it needed a better presentation.  There were some interesting facts, such as many of the atrocities attributed to Vlad the Impaler were actually committed by his father, Vlad the Evil.  If you want to get some background, I'd recommend the video.  It just won't be as titillating as some of the websites out there on Vlad.",1144454400,13,781,4.705882352941177
