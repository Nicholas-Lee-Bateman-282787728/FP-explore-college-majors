4106534,5,B003BJODJQ,"If your little one does not have a collection of Thomas DVD's yet then I think this would be a very nice introduction.  However, I have listed the episodes so those of you that already have a collection going can see if it is a worthy purchase.  This is an interesting selection of episodes that might make a good addition to one's vehicle DVD selection if you have a big Thomas fan and a long trip coming up!

1.  Thomas gets Tricked (pilot episode)
2.  Edward Helps Out (1st season, 2nd episode)

6.  Trust Thomas  (3rd season, 13th episode)
7.  Henry and the Elephant  (4th season, 19th episode)
8.  Cranky Bugs (5th season, 1st episode)
9.  Snow Engine  (7th season, 14th episode)
10. Thomas Saves the Day (8th season, 6th episode)
  FYI: 8th season was the 1st season to be produced by HiT Entertainment (2004 broadcast)

4106675,4,B003BJODJQ,"This DVD set contains the episodes that older Thomas fans grew up to love and cherish for years. Parents that are not familiar with this version of Thomas will want to ignore this one if they are ""bored"" or ""creeped out"" by the models with non moving faces that change expressions. Yes, the episodes are harsher in tone, but closer to real life. The engines are working hard trying to make their boss happy. Sir Topham Hatt is a loving man and very forgiving, but he has to get tough in order to set his engines straight, and they tend to get very mischievous sometimes. He is almost like a father to his engines.

The first few episodes are based on books written years ago by the Rev. Wi. Awdry, and they teach kids about trust and honesty, as well as the fact that there are consequences for every action. If parents are looking for a sugar coated Thomas, then you will not find it here, This is the Thomas that older fans grew up with and enjoy. I loved this series as a child, and I would not trade it for anything else in the world",1440374400,,1037,4.2639593908629445

As I looked at it through her eyes, of course she would.  About 90% of it involves scowling, whinging, upset trains.  I'm not sure if this is an intentional thing in children's entertainment, but I simply don't like it.

4106892,5,B003BJODJQ,"If you have a child in your home who loves Thomas & Friends as much as my grandson, these videos are perfect. Being able to stream them free is more than worth the cost of the Prime membership...we watch at least one of these per day.

This is a collection of several (somewhat) related episodes of the ""Thomas & Friends"" TV show. Total running time is right at two and a half hours, but that includes several intro and outro title sequences. My grandson has heard those songs so many times from watching these collections that he sings them as he's walking around pretending to be a steam engine. This one doesn't have a lot of live-action scenes at the depot with the conductor, so that's a plus as far as my grandson is concerned.

Here's a list of the episodes (and the narrator). There aren't repeats between the different collections...at least, none that I've seen...but it's always nice to know what's coming up. Sometimes my grandson asks for a specific story and I have to try and figure out which collection it's in AND where in that collection. :-)

4106913,5,B003BJODJQ,"My grand children and I are great fans of Thomas and Friends. Like the other DVDs, this one gave us much entertainement. The children love the series song, and though they are too young to learn english, they can sing nicely ""they're two, they're for, they're six, they're eight, shunting trucks and hauling freight"" and so on... The stories are enthralling for very young boys and girls. When they hear: ""And then, there was trouble"", they know they may expect something thrilling (but not frightening) like a train leaving the rails, trucks upside down, milk or flour or whatever spilled everywhere, and they enjoy it. They are interested by the way old railways worked, the points, the signals, the water a thank engine must not forget to take, the coupling rods which must not break...But they learn an other kind of lessons too. Lessons about behaviour. The little engines doesn't always pay attention to what the fat controller (one of our favourite characters) say, they want to have their own way, they refuse to be helped by their fellow engines...and ""then there is trouble""! Especially with Thomas, ""the cheeky one"".But hope is never lost, because he always succeeds in putting right his mistakes. There are repetitions (the fat controller saying: ""you have caused confusion and delay, LOL!), but it is not disturbing at all. On the contrary, children love it. We do appreciate every DVD of ""Thomas and Friends"" I happen to buy, because they are, at the same time, very amusing and educational.",1368316800,,1505,4.929133858267717

I am surprised by how much negativity there is in these stories ... the characters frequently taunt and tease each other or make fun of one another.  In addition it promotes a very fear -based hierarchical societal structure , whereby the trains are aftaid and cowering and meakly trying to appease and win approval from their ""boss"" Sier Toppinhat.  These are not positive infuences as we try to advance as a society.  We prefer Frannies Feet, a very uplifting show and Elmo's World.",1325462400,5,549,4.808510638297872

But MOSTLY, that the DVD will not allow you to forego them, and go straight to the Thomas stories! That pisses me off. When I BUY something, I should not be forced to watch commercials prior to what I purchased! They should at least place the commercials at the END of the Video, and give you the option to watch them, or not!!! I would not mind that. I would even be compelled to watch them, once the video was OVER! It's no fun to have an impatient 3 year old yelling for Thomas, while your trying to get past 20 commercials!",1307577600,130,697,4.2481203007518795

4106973,5,B003BJODJQ,"So my 3 year old didn't really like Thomas until this past Christmas so he hasn't really seen many of the older episodes.  I think this DVD is great because it includes not only the first Thomas episode ever, but also all the best episodes ever.  It stars all the famous trains, narrators, and music!  My sons really got a kick out of watching this DVD because there are just so many episodes to watch that it was like a Thomas marathon for them.  I do like too that they seemed to enhance all the old episodes so they look crisper and brighter.  They are not CGI animation like the newer Thomas DVDs but these are all the classic episodes perfect for any Thomas fan new or old.  This DVD is especially great for those without many Thomas DVDs because it features so much!  Even all the bonus content rocks!  Definitely worth buying!",1276387200,28,833,4.398692810457517

8393698,5,B003BJODJQ,"My little one loves watching this on our Prime account. He will watch it until it goes off. I personally like the older ones better than the newer ones, where they show the actual toys, and so does our 3 year old. He watches them with his wooden trains, so I guess he relates more to these older episodes.",1495152000,,305,4.186440677966102

8393705,1,B003BJODJQ,This is the first Thomas train we've ever watched. Not sure why it is so popular - the trains are quite mean to each other. Not qualities that I want my son to learn about.,1483747200,,172,3.942857142857143
