8321889,4,B001MUMLI6,"I personally found this to be an underated movie. I know most people will disagree with me, but I enjoyed it. It was a delightfully charming story, reminisent of the Adventures of Pete and Pete, with a loveable scamp always causng trouble and his spunky best friend trying to figure out her feelings for him. AnnaSophia Robb (Leslie, from Bridge to Terabithia) plays the role of the best friend (a major plus!) She takes what could have been a minor supporting role and portrays her character with depth and warmth; her torn-hearted persona provides her first on-screen kiss and, although a little mature for her age, the pain of not having her feelings returned was deeply moving (I cried when she did).

Although not on the same level as Bridge to Terabithia, (but then, what is?) Doubting Thomas is a nice way to spend an afternoon. Most people find fault in this film and I agree there is some to be had, but if you just relax and enjoy it, I find there's also much to be praised.",1238716800,,984,4.52808988764045
