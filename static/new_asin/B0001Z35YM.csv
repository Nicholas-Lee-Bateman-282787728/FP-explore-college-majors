8018587,4,B0001Z35YM,"I just played this DVD for my 3 1/2 year old, and she liked everything but the Wishbone show.  It looked boring to me, and I didn't think she'd get into it, and sure enough she asked, ""Mommy, what's this show doing on here?""  I ended up fast forwarding it.  It was an odd choice for this collection, seemed for a slightly older audience.  Yet I can't imagine any kid old enough for Wishbone to want to sit through Barney.  All the other shows would appeal to the youngens.

Oh, boy, I was laughing when reading the other review here!  I can understand about the whole Barney thing that he/she was telling about, as I agree (though kids love it, and it's a nice slow pace for them), and I really laughed at the Kipper discription.  We are huge Kipper fans here, and I didn't even notice how off that part with the dogs on the swing was; it went right over my head just as with my daughter!  I wonder if the makers of these shows put these things in on purpose for an inside joke.  Well, I still love Kipper-- it has to be the cutest kids' show out there, and we own them all.

I am happy with this purchase, to have some kids' favorites all right there, even though I'll have to fast forward Wishbone.",1129075200,,1200,4.1965065502183405
