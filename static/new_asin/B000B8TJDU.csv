8083669,1,B000B8TJDU,"A truly awful film. Quite mindless, beginning to end.  With worse production values than a made-for-TV after-school special.  There's a good reason Ernest Goes To Camp was the first one that got a wide release.",1455062400,,210,4.9714285714285715

8083672,4,B000B8TJDU,"This film is a complete classic, not only for the Ernest P. Worrell completist, but for anyone who truly appreciates bizarre cinema or anything from the 80's. However, the DVD itself is clearly just a digitized version from a VHS master. It's a real travesty, as I feel my VHS copy from years ago actually looks better on the screen. It's also a REGION 2 DVD meant to be playable only in Europe. Buyer beware.",1382400000,,409,4.466666666666667
