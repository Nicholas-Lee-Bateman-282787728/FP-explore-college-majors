2765182,5,B000NDEXFC,"This show oringinated in France and was transferred to London's West End and completely rewritten for the English/American audience (the French version was even bleaker!).  It opened at London's Barbican Theatre on October 8, 1985 for a limited season but found a home at the Palace Theatre on December 4, 1985 and on April 3, 2004 transferred to the Queen's Theatre just down the road and is still playing today.  It opened on Broadway at the Broadway Theatre on May 12, 1987 and ran until May 18, 2003 for 6680 performances.

This show launched many West End and Broadway careers.  To celebrate the 10th anniversary of its West End opening, producer Cameron Macintosh gathered cast members from London, New York and Austrailia to perform the show in concert at the Royal Albert Hall.

This production was overpoduced like all of Cameron's shows but for a concert performance it was perfect.  London and Broadway's Colm Wilkinson leads the cast as Jean Valjean. London favorite Michael Ball, Austialia's Philip Quast and Broadway favorite Judy Kuhn join the show with Miss Saigon star Lea Solanga rounding out the cast.

The encore has 17 different Valjeans together to sing ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" in each performer's native language.

For fans of the show, this will probably be the only filmed version of the show, unless Rob Marshall gets the itch to direct a movie of the show.

The only thing that at a $35 list price, it is way too expensive.  I'll wait until it is a little more reasonable.",1203033600,19,1506,4.8023255813953485

We saw the play four times on Times Square when Colm lead it.  However, when in the balcony you could see the floor spin as if water when the inspector found his life empty.  The 25 Anniversary from England was also very special, that one in amazing quality and sound on Blu-Ray.",1436054400,,441,4.544303797468355

2765316,5,B000NDEXFC,"I first saw this production on PBS years ago and made a VHS recording which is now deteriorating . Any one who was and is captured by this music plus the interviews with the composers, producers, cast will have a lasting enjoyable experience.",1401148800,,242,4.651162790697675
2765317,5,B000NDEXFC,Best musical ever and made even better with the anniversary cast edition. Watch this over & over again and never get sick of it.  Totally recomend this to everyone!,1400544000,,164,4.655172413793103
2765318,5,B000NDEXFC,Excellent.  I always enjoy Les Miz.  Seen it on the stage.  The movie is not that good.  Only the stage play is worth it.,1399593600,,121,3.9166666666666665

2765322,5,B000NDEXFC,Everyone has his/her own as to who is the best but the choices they made on my behalf in this one are very good. Michael Maguire in particular. Of course Colm can never be replaced but we all knew the day would come.,1393632000,,216,4.046511627906977

2765334,5,B000NDEXFC,This cast is by far the best group of performers.  I can't watch the subsequent versions because this cast is so good.  I wish they had stopped after making this version.,1390348800,,170,4.451612903225806

2765337,5,B000NDEXFC,"Well, how can you lose with Hugh Jackman in the lead and superb music? This will be my ALL-TIME favorite. Having seen the stage version five times with all sorts of actors, this movie stands out with close-ups that make no attempt to hide little flaws. WOW!",1384819200,,257,4.48936170212766
2765338,5,B000NDEXFC,"This is the only way to listen to or see this amazing show. The vocals in the movie (and serious lack of orchestration) were so disappointing, if you are looking for a way to introduce people to the truly majestic piece of musical theater that Les Miserables is, this is the way to do it. Colm Wilkinson and Philip Quast are unmatchable as Valjean and Javert. This is a serious treat for theater fans!",1383523200,,401,4.4324324324324325

This two-in-one pack contains both films (Mommy and Mommy2), as well as a generous assortment of extras and bonus material: feature-length commentaries, bloopers, interviews, a making-of documentary.  If you're a fan of Max Allan Collins or the other releases from Neo Noir, this harder-to-find combo pack may be a good way to pick up both films and all the extras at once.",1382659200,,517,5.070588235294117

2765341,5,B000NDEXFC,"Les Miserables, the 10th Anniversary.  An awesome and entertaining concert.
All the singers were excellent but still Lea Salonga, who portrayed Eponine,
did justice on singing ""On My Own"".  Lea, continue singing and giving concerts.
You have thousands of fans internationally.

I would also commend Cameron for the production of this concert.  Brilliant
presentation, intelligent choices of the cast, brilliant choice of directors, and
also excellent music and lyrics of Claude-Michell and Boublil.",1378771200,,498,5.780821917808219

2765343,4,B000NDEXFC,"Unlike some other reviewers, I will not comment on the sound or video quality of this set. I am writing as someone who didn't ""get"" Les Miz until I saw this show on TV, and I immediately fell in love with it and bought the video tape. Since then, I've seen Colm Wilkinson perform it twice, and was mesmerized. The cast in this show is truly stellar. My main complaint with the DVD is that the reception of and speeches by Cameron MacKintosh at the end, and those of the writers of Les Miz, are not included before the performance of the ""17 Jean Valjeans."" This was a HUGE disappointment, as it captured the spirit of the performance and the interaction among those involved. If you didn't see that, you didn't really see the whole Royal Albert Hall show. The DVD is fine, but the second disc honestly isn't worth the extra money. Transfer your VHS tape to DVD instead.",1376956800,,869,4.4375
2765354,5,B000NDEXFC,I saw this concert on PBS and was thrilled to be able to purchase it.  It is great to have my own DVD and be able to share it with friends I know will appreciate it.  This is far superior to any other Les Mis production I've seen.,1371686400,,230,3.7708333333333335

2765377,5,B000NDEXFC,I've heard a few other performances of this production but this one takes the cake! The gigantic choir on stage the whole time just adds to it.,1362528000,,143,4.333333333333333
2765378,5,B000NDEXFC,If you have seen Les Mis live on stage or the really weak movie version you must see this.  All other versions pale in comparison.  Be particularly sure to watch it to the very end after the producers come together and talk about the show.  When they finish the lead singers from all over the world come in and sing together in their respective languages.  It is incredably moving.,1361232000,,381,4.478260869565218

2765380,5,B000NDEXFC,"Just being able to see Colm Wilkinson as Jean Valjean is enough to recommend this.

2765381,5,B000NDEXFC,Received the CD of the movie track and could not compare it with this anniversary concert.  Also liked the 25th anniversary but was not happy with some of the singer/actors.  The 10th anniversary had it all.,1360713600,,207,4.722222222222222

2765383,5,B000NDEXFC,This is my most favorite musical of all time. I could watch this on a weekly basis.

I just wish that the same themes didn't repeat so often.  The music itself is original, but within the musical it isn't.

We were in the mezzanine, too far away see facial expressions and it was before they had individual mikes.  So, I left thinking, ""what's the big deal?""  Since then, I've been listening to the recording and have learned the story.  When the 25th Anniversary concert came out on PBS, I recalled seeing this 10th Anniversary concert on PBS and liking it better.  So I bought it.  Now that I've seen this production, I am absolutely enthralled with Les Mis.  Of course the cast is the best, but the best part is ""being up close"" and not just understanding the words, but actually feeling the words with the character.  I've watched it over and over.

I much prefer this one to the newer version, even with all the technical improvements and bells and whistles added to the 25th anniversary show.  For one thing, Colm Wilkinson is now and forever Valjean for me; Philip Quast is amazing as Javert and Lea Salonga is heartbreaking in the role of Eponine, while her voice is transcendent.  I also don't feel that anyone has ever equaled Frances Ruffelle as Fantine, even after 25 years.  This production is heartfelt and the showing of the barricades on screen adds immeasurably to the effect of the concert itself.  The entire cast is superb.

However, I received my copy today, and watched it with my family (who are also huge fans), and I can say that the quality was great and the left out scene of Gavroche's ""Little People"" has been put back in.
However, my only problem with it was the audio. I was pleased with most of the songs, however, the audio leaves much to be desired for some certain songs. Most of the solos are perfectly fine. It is mostly during the trios, quartets, etc. that you can hear the difference. Since one of my favorite songs is ""One Day More"", I was upset when I couldn't hear some parts, including Marius', very well. And since I know it could be better (listened to it over a thousand times on Youtube), I was quite disappointed with the audio.

I loved the play on Broadway.  I love the CD.  In the past, I felt joy and chills at the sound of Colm Wilkinson's voice.  But time has taken its toll.  His voice has no strength, no range, no resonance on this DVD.  It's not my equipment, which is high quality.  LG 47LW6500 HDTV.  OPPO BDP-93 Blu-ray.  Marantz SR7005 A/V receiver.

2765483,5,B000NDEXFC,"Honestly words cant even describe how AMAZING this concert it! I have seen the Broadway musical twice (and am going to see it again in January)...and although this is only a concert of the songs its still incredible (especially if you have surround sound!!). All the ""favorites"" return to the stage for an incredible performance and WORDS just don't do it justice!! I have been a HUGE Les Mis fan since I was about 8 yrs old (25 years ago!!) and honestly I don't know why it took me so long to purchase this DVD!! It's the best thing we will have until they release the ACTUAL musical (start to finish).

Although it was made in 1995 (as you can tell when they pan to the audience...what WERE we thinking in the 90's? Our fashion sense was SERIOUSLY lacking back then! LOL) its a MUST HAVE for any true Les Mis fan! Colm Wilkinson reprises his role as the most LOVED Valjean that we've had. The Master of the House (Thenardier - played by Alun Armstrong) and his wife were comical as always and never ceases to crack me up!! I'm not the biggest fan of Judy Kuhn (Cosette) but I guess you cant always please everyone! Lea Salonga (Eponine) was awesome...she has always been my favorite character and I SWORE I was going to play the part of Eponine on Broadway when I grew up! LOL :) Fantine (Ruthie Henshall) was great but the wig they had on her was hard to ignore (it was NOT very attractive at ALL!). Australia's Philip Quast reprised his role as Javert and blew me away with his voice and talent!!

Even though they did not perform the musical (and only sang, dressed in costume, standing at microphones) the cast still stayed in character and conveyed the FEELING in each song wonderfully! It doesn't matter how many times I see the production, I still ALWAYS cry during Fantine's death....Eponine's death...and of course Valjean's death. Colm Wilkinson sang ""Bring Him Home"" more beautiful than I could ever put into words.

One of my favorite moments in this DVD was at the very end when SEVENTEEN of the ""Valjeans"" from world-wide performances all came up on stage and sang ""One Day More."" It was really awesome as each Valjean took a turn at the microphone, singing in many different languages! It was a very moving performance and such a treat for fans!

The orchestra and chorus of what I would say was over a HUNDRED singers was phenomenal! After watching this DVD I am SUPER excited to see the full-fledged performance again in January!! It's also given me the opportunity to watch it with my oldest daughter (age 18) and husband so that I could explain the story and help them understand what was going on. Now when they go to see the Broadway musical they will be able to follow the storyline and understand it much better...which will help them to ENJOY it more as well!

The ONLY negatives that I have are:
~During (young) Cosette's song, ""Castle On A Cloud"" someone dropped a book or something and it was LOUD making Cosette jump a bit b/c it startled her.
~They have YET to release a DVD of the ACTUAL musical....and I am still wondering WHY!?
~If I wasn't there to explain what was going on to my husband and daughter, it would have been a little hard for them to follow. It would have been nice to get a booklet that EXPLAINED the story a bit (like they have in the CD's)...instead of a booklet with nothing but pics of the musical.

If you are a Les Mis fan then you shouldn't wait....just BUY this DVD. You will NOT be disappointed!! :)",1321920000,2,3458,4.48966613672496

Since I listened the music for the first time I loved it. First I bought the CD a few years ago and recently decided to buy a DVD, had to chose for the 10th or 25th Anniversary. I picked the end of the first act, where all the characters participated and watched it in YouTube, I selected the 10th because I liked the singers who played Cossete,Marius and Eponine more.
After I ordered the 10th I had the opportunity to see the 25th and I also liked this one.
It is difficult for me to decide which the best is, I said before I like more those three characters and the story was more explicit very dramatic for instance the scene of the barricades as well as others.
I liked more the singers playing Javert and Fantine in the 25th Anniversary, also the characters of Eponine in the 10th was the same as Fantine in the 25th and she is very good.
The end of the show was very emotional when some of the actors who played Vajean around the world sang.
This is one of my favorite musical and it captures the story of Victor Hugo masterpiece very well.",1306195200,,1339,5.175115207373272

The incredible cast, backed by a truly wonderful symphony orchestra, gave this inspired musical its full scope. I got my first recording of this a few years ago, buying it from the PBS fundraising special. That was a videotape recording. I almost wore it out, playing it over and again. It is one of my two favorite music recordings of all time. So I was happy to be able to update recently to the DVD. The performance remains great, of course, but I have one disappointing caveat to the DVD. On the videotape, after the end of the performance, we were able to see the extended standing ovation from the audience, feeling just as we feel having watched and listened to these amazing singers putting their souls into these inspired songs. Cameron Mackintosh then came onstage and spoke for a time of the travails of originally bringing Les Mis to the stage. He then introduced the incoming parade of Jean Valjeans from many nations, each singing in his own language. The DVD cut directly from the end of the performance to the parade of Jean Valjeans, leaving out the extended applause and all of Cameron Mackintosh. I found that very disappointing.

an experience of a lifetime. I want to personally thank you and the whole cast for a first class presentation. Now, Mr. Wilkinson, Quast. Lea Salonga and Mr/Mrs. Thnardier, Marius, Cossette, well the whole cast should all be highly commended for making each character as real as life! I simply loved this 10th Anniversary of
Les Miserables. and unfortunately when you compare the two of them (the 25th
version), the results are way below your espectations.  But what's above all expectations is AMAZON!! What a great company you are, offering the public the best

Now, don't get me wrong I did enjoy the 25th Anniversary edition and the storyline was much, much more polished. The beauty in any song is coveyed in emotion and sincerity.

The video presentation of this 10th Anniversary is quite clean and the music just as good.
If anyone is looking for a better alternative of Les Miserable than the Blu-ray of the 25th Anniversary I highly recommend the 10th Anniversary Drean Cast.

I've had the video for years but have been waiting for the perfect DVD to come out.  However, after watching the 25th anniversary concert, I knew I could put it off no longer.  This is the one to own, and I have been very happy with the quality.  It also has everything in it that my video does, except for the very long speeches at the end.  It does have the international Valjeans, however.  This IS the Dream Cast.  For me you just can't beat Michael Ball, Lea Salonga (as Eponine, NOT as Fantine!), Phillip Quast, Alun Armstrong and Colm Wilkinson.  There can be no comparison to the 25th anniversary concert, although there are pros and cons to both.  It was interesting to see the different portions that were added or left out in the new concert, and I LOVED Hadley Fraser as Grantaire in the 25th - why oh why didn't they use him as Marius (or anybody but Nick Jonas?!)?  But after watching the 25th anniversary concert, I HAVE to pull out the 10th just to remember how it's supposed to be done.

2765552,5,B000NDEXFC,"I am so glad I bought this DVD before buying the 25th anniversary concert - it is fantastic and the cast is infinitely better!  I've read other reviews about the quality of the 10th Anniversary DVD but I think the picture and sound are fine.  I bought this about two months ago when I saw that the 25th anniversary concert had been released.  I purchased this concert because I saw that Colm Wilkinson was Jean Valjean and I had seen him in the live musical in London in 1991 and he will forever be the definitive Jean Valjean to me.  Also, the end of the performance with many different actors who portrayed Jean Valjean in different countries around the world joining Colm Wilkinson on stage to sing ""Do you hear the people sing"" together with lines from all their native languages is stunningly beautiful and moving.  The entire ensemble of actors really is a dream cast (with the possible exception of Ruthie Henshall as Fantine - she was very good but I did miss Patti Lupone who I think was an amazing Fantine in London and on Broadway).  However, that small nitpick aside, the cast is just stand-out after stand-out.  Particularly spectacular performances are given by Phillip Quast as Javert and the absolute delight of Alun Armstrong as Thenardier - his rendition of ""Master of the House"" is a truly joyful experience that should not be missed by anyone who is a true fan of the musical - the entire stage of actors who are behind Alun as he sings that song are visibly delighted and enjoying his rendition of that song as much as the audience.  Conversely, the 25th Anniversary edition concert is a true disappointment - the cast is just not as strong all the way across the board.  I am a person who LOVES the live musical - I've seen it twice in London and twice on Broadway and if you're like me and are just a true fan of the musical, the 10th Anniversary dream cast concert is a must.  It is a joy to watch and makes me happy and inspired every time I watch it and I really believe others will feel the same way!",1299888000,9,2027,4.439353099730458

2765555,5,B000NDEXFC,"I'm one of the many who appreciate this work; I had the good fortune to see it in person when it was on tour and found that to be a memorable experience. I bought a Laser Disc widescreen version of the 1995 10th Anniversary Performance which I still have and continue to enjoy. I do not have the DVD referenced here so I will confine my comments to the performance with one exception.

Having read some of the other reviews I was interested in the references to omissions and deletions in the DVD; this prompted me to compare run times and I found the DVD had a run time of 148 minutes while the Laser Disc version had a run time of 160 minutes. I have not found any references to the VHS tapes run time.

The performance elevates this review to an entirely different level; this performance is powerful, disturbing, emotional, and at times, even funny. There are many moments of beauty and drama, and then there is the show-stopping scene, ""Master of the House"" featuring Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway that leaves one laughing and applauding.

This performance is anchored by Colm Wilkinson's forceful characterization of Jean Valjean. The other leads are also convincingly performed by Philip Quast as Javert, Ruthie Henshall as Fantine, Judy Kuhn as Cosette, Lea Salonga as Eponine, Michael Ball as Marius, and Michael Maguire as Enjolras. I did not personally observe and real weaknesses that would distract from the overall production.

It was effective the way the performers did not drop out of character during applause; the missing scenery does not really distract from the drama and the strong emotional impact of this production.

After watching this performance my wife and I find ourselves haunted by the beautiful melodies for days afterward; we have to limit our exposure to this work simply because it is so powerful!

I would love to have the complete stage presentation on video but it does not appear that will happen anytime soon. In the meantime this is a choice way to enjoy the music and the excellent performances by all parties to this production.",1298332800,,2076,4.8011204481792715

Colm Wilkinson is incomparable as Jean Valjean; Philp Quast's performance as Javert is complex and powerful. Michael Ball's Marius delivers all the idealistic hopefulness of his character, while Lea Salonga's &Eacute;ponine is poignant and heartbreaking. Every member of the cast delivers a world-class performance.

The addition of the chorus adds a rich extra dimension, while the orchestra catches every nuance with magnificent power. The staging is nicely done, with costumes and interspersed scenes from the play shown on video.

The climax, with seventeen different actors who portray Valjean from around the world singing in their own languages, could not be more spectacular.

I was at that show and I was apsolutely taken aback with the power of the production....simply amazing.  Anyone considering buying this show edition which is definitely miles better than other versions, edited or otherwise, (Not demeaning those I have to say) I highly recommend this original version. Buy it and you will be like me watching it every opportune moment.
Finally can I add a footnote....Susan Boyle did a great job of 'I dream the dream' but once again in no way does her version compere to the rendition by Ruthie Henshall as Fantine....MAGICAL is the thing that comes to mind.

If you think you have seen Les Mis...you haven't until you watch this....sound well up for atmosphere,  good bottle of wine with some 'bites' snacks, wife or partner close by, 4 hours to spare and you will think you are heaven.

about the lack of multi channel -  I think a lot of ' serious' listeners to music favor old fashioned stereo  ( high Qu. equipment) , and IF this was redone in multi ch it would be 100 % artificial.  do we need bombs and rockets from the rear speakers , all the singers were front & center. as for distortion, depends on the fine adjustment of machine ( espec. VHS for technical reasons) but if the tracking is right, old VHS stereo has fine sound specs , better I think than reel to reel tape. way better than I phone.  certainly they can 'clean up' the sound to CD + standards ,  but multi chan ?? no thanks.

might as well put in my half a cent --  To me all the central characters are spectacular singers. as a creepy old man, I love both Ms Henshall & Ms Salonga , tears in eye every time I watch - and that'd be over 10 times.  I don't get the attacks on Ms Salonga's selection as Eponine , 'not in character' -- Yea, She sings way, WAY  too well ( looks also)  to be an impoverished waif.

The UK uses an entirely different format for recording and broadcasting TV.  They use the PAL format.  In the US, where many are playing this, we use the NTSC format.  In the transfer from one format to the other, much picture quality is lost.  Be reminded of all those old British comedies that you can watch on PBS stations.  The quality is not as sharp...due to the Transfer process.  The other issue it that it was recorded in 1995.

What is this that i bought?

Don't get me wrong here. The quality on my Blu Ray was fantastic. the sound was supurb. it even played as if it were blu ray, FULL screen. i was suprised to say the least. what i thought i was buying and why i give this less then five stars is that the player were STATIC. standing still in front of a mic and singing, not acting the parts like what i saw in San Francisco all thos years ago. I was bored of it before the bishop was through telling ValJean that he bought his soul for God with the silver he had stollen

I don't mind the bits and pieces that were missing. I wanted to see the WHOLE thing all over again like i saw it the first time. I hope this is not how the britsh saw it.

2765674,5,B000NDEXFC,"This DVD of Les Miserables is a must-have for your collection. I had it on VHS and lost it when my daughter took it and have been wanting to replace it with the DVD for a long time.  This is so beautiful and amazing.  This set is a 2-disc collector's edition. Disc 1 is the concert (live performance) and disc 2 includes the making of Les Miserables and a booklet is included.  The performance features the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra and a 150-voice choir. At the end of the performance, 17 Jean Valjeans from 17 different countries march down the center from the back carrying flags of their countries to the stage. They each sing a part of ""Do You Hear the People Sing"" in their native languages.  The beauty of this masterpiece made me cry. Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert at London's Royal Albert Hall is AWESOME!!!!!",1282867200,3,831,4.63265306122449

2765676,5,B000NDEXFC,"This DVD really does capture broadway and put it on your screen at home.  You see it in the beginning of the DVD with the opening song.  From beginning to end its non-stop great music.  Its got an all-star cast including some of the best of Les Mis.  Valjean (Colm Wilkinson)is so outstanding, his presence and his voice is just truly remarkable and has always made the character for me.  And of course Lea Salonga as Eponine just has the voice and the face that seems so lovely and elegant.

People who have not seen the play or know the story may have a hard time following what is going on in the DVD because it goes from song to song with nearly nothing in between.  Although they do show pictures on the big screen from the original play and also have a small side stage where a small amount of acting is done during songs, not to mention where the Baracade appears.  But there is a short synopsis of the main story in the DVD book.

For those who have seen the play and know whats going on, then this will just be memories upon memories and bring Les Mis right into your home.  I recommend this DVD for music lovers in general.  I haven't met anyone yet who can hate or be unimpressed with this music.",1280707200,3,1207,4.25
2765677,5,B000NDEXFC,"I was in London in July 2010 and thought I must go do something a bit more intellectual. I thought that instead of all the waste of time and money on the shopping districts, I should go watch a classic play such as Les Miserables. It was a very wise decision because this play is truly a piece of art.

First of all its a musical play. Not a musical like ""Chicago"" where the songs can't be heard for long, but something close to the quality of the music of ""Moulin Rouge"" where you would go buy the soundtrack afterwards. The songs and music were breath taking.

The story is also wonderful and sad too. The American guy sitting next to me was in tears since the play started. There were also moments for me when I was too close to having a few tears, but I am not the kind of guy that cries at movies or plays.

Great Play. Worth every pound paid.",1279238400,3,848,4.127272727272727

2765679,5,B000NDEXFC,"Les Miserables is one of my favorite musicals and when this first came out on VHS, I purchased it immediately.  Loved it.  When it came out on DVD (it was one DVD at the time with two sides), I bought that as well.  I loved that, mainly because the sounds was a lot better than the VHS.  The only thing I didn't really like was the fact that there were no extras on it.  I then found this version and was ecstatic because I found out that it had the ""Stage by Stage: The Making of Les Miserables.""  I had never seen this before but had heard about it.  It's great and really makes this DVD worth buying.  This 2 disc DVD comes with a booklet as well (mainly containing pictures of the 10th Anniversary Concert & the summary of the show).

I also love the fact that the entire show is on one DVD; you don't have to get up and turn the DVD over after act I is finished.  Definitely a plus for me.  And of course there's the cast.  They really chose the best people who had been in the show before to play all the roles.  Colm Wilkinson is the *best* Jean Valjean I have ever seen (and heard).  Phillip Quast is magnificent as Javert.  I remember having heard him on the complete symphonic recording.  Lea Solonga and Ruthie Henshall only made this concert even better.  Their voices are beautiful.  And of course having Michael Ball reprise his role as Marius was perfect.  I kind of wish Patti LuPone had been chosen to play Fantine, but Ruthie is excellent.

All in all, this is a fantastic DVD of the 10th anniversary concert.  I only wish they had done another concert for the 20th anniversary!",1278201600,2,1596,4.2885906040268456

There are over 200+ reviews on the concert, so I'll just say this: if you can only buy one concert version of Les Miserables, this is the one to get.  Every.single.performer is on point.  I cheered, I stomped, I air pumped my fist in the general awesomness of it.  This is what I have playing on the TV when I'm doing housework - it makes everything go so much faster...except when I stop to play air violin during a song, which is kinda like air guitar, only slightly lamer.

2765704,5,B000NDEXFC,"I watched the original PBS presentation a few years back and loved it then. Recently, I rented it from Netflix and once again was captivated. I decided then and there that I would buy the disk so that I could watch it anytime I wanted. I have seen the stage production at least four times and is one of my favorite musicals of all time. I love that the concert version features all of the actor/singers who have played Valjean all around the world. The timelessness of Victor Hugo's immortal tale of the French revolution, and the story of Jean Valjean brings me to tears every time. The inclusion of Lea Solonga who plays Fantine is inspired. When she sings the haunting ""On My Own"" it is worth every penny spent on the DVD and makes this the perfect concert. My only disappointment is that LES MISERABLES is not available in Blu-ray. To anyone who loves musical theatre it is a must-own DVD.",1272153600,,893,4.484662576687117

I have watched this presentation several times since we got it just because it is so good. You will not be disappointed if you can find a copy of this concert.",1268006400,,454,4.170454545454546
2765711,4,B000NDEXFC,"I could not give higher marks to the 10th Anniversary production of this great old show.  I gave it only 4 Stars out of 5 for weaknesses in the DVD, released in 2008, for reasons that I shall describe later.  The production design and lighting were awe inspiring and the musical forces brought to bear by the London Symphony Orchestra and a huge chorus were worthy of a performance of a Mahler Symphony.  Colm Wilkinson, as Valjean, was brilliant.  Although already 51 at the time this performance was filmed he was nevertheless wonderful, particularly during the difficult high pitched mezza voce passages of his solos.  Others were equal to Wilkinson, though.  Alun Armstrong, as the crooked innkeeper, was a comic wonder, as was Jenny Galloway as his equally funny wife.  I also loved  the young and beautiful Ruthie Henshall, as Fantine.  She has a gorgeous mezzo voice, which she used to perfection here.  Also noteworthy were the also young and beautiful Lea Salonga, as  Eponine, Michael Ball, as Marius, and Judy Kuhn, as Colette.  All had both the musical and dramatic skill to to showcase this classic musical theater piece.

Now comes the hard part.  Despite this performance having, apparently, been filmed in widescreen format, the disc's producers, for reasons I simply cannot understand, failed to give us a Blu-ray version although, by the time this disc was released in 2008,  Blu-ray was starting to take hold.  Equally disappointing was the two channel soundtrack.  This classic performance of a classic show warranted a remixing of the soundtrack to 5.1 channels.  Had the show been less outstanding than it was, either visually or sonically, I would not have been as disappointed as I am.  As it is, though, I anguish over what a wasted opportunity it turned out to be.  In my estimation, this aspect of the disc, alas, deserves only 1 Star out of 5.  For that reason, I won't be buying it but if a Blu-ray version with a 5.1 HD audio soundtrack is ever produced I'll be first in line.",1267574400,,2006,4.807017543859649

2765805,5,B000NDEXFC,"When Victor Hugo wrote Les Miserables [The Wretched, The Poor ones, The Victims] little did he realize he was writing a timeless work, translated into every language, made into movies and a theatre production that has played with a consistently sold out audience.

Victor Hugo, born on February 26th, 1802, died on May 22nd, 1885, lived for 83 years; for the most part, dedicated to writing poetry, novels and essays. Among many of his works, Les contemplations [contemplations] and The Hunchback of Notre Dame are well known and have also been made into movies. Victor Hugo's childhood was lived through tumultuous events; the overthrow of the Bourbon Dynasty in the French Revolution, the rise and fall of the First Republic and the rise of the First French Empire and dictatorship under Napoleon Bonaparte.

Victor Hugo conceived the idea of writing a novel about social injustice but it took him over 17 years to complete Les Miserables; a 1200 page book about the struggle of an ex-convict Jean Valjean as he attempts to redeem the sins of the past. The book is magnificent for it transcends time, making generations of readers identify with the characters and their plea. The play brings to life the social injustice lived by many in France and the songs are written with such depth of understanding of human behavior that as we sit to listen and watch this musical, we can not help it but be captivated by the performance.

At first, we thought we were getting the whole play, only to realize that we had all the songs in the sequence of the play and a finale that is breathtaking, for they bring those that interpret Jean Valjean's from all over the world and they unite to sing, each in their native language the famous closing song that calls for a crying rally as it asks ""do you hear the people sing lost in the valley of the night? It is the music of the people who are climbing to the light. For the wretched of the earth, there is a fame that never dies even the darkest night will end and the sun will rise. They will live again freedom in the garden of the Lord, they will walk behind the ploughshare; they will put away the sword, the chain will be broken and all men will have their reward. Will you join in our crusade? Who will be strong and stand with me? Somewhere beyond the barricade, is there a world you long to see? Do you hear the people sing? Say, do you hear the distant drums? Is it the future that they bring when tomorrow comes!""

The cast is the original London Company: Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Michael Ball as Marius, Philip Quast as Javert, Judy Kuhn as Cosette and Ruthie Henshall as Fantine.

Depending on the mood of the day, these songs can make you cry, like ""I dreamed a dream"" and ""Empty Chairs at empty tables."" We recently had a death in the family and these words simply overwhelmed us when we heard: ""there is a grief that can't be spoken, there is a pain goes on and on, empty chairs at empty tables, now my friends are dead and gone.""

Therefore, if you enjoy this timeless classic, this DVD is for you. Our favorite feature is the lyrics can be played as subtitles that allowed us to sing along. Superb, don't miss it!",1247702400,2,3172,4.507826086956522

It is impossible using this DVD.  It's all singing.  While beautiful, it does nothing for storytelling.  Unless you've seen the play, you will have NO idea what's going on here.

I have watched this performance so many times in the past 2 months that I will probably have to go buy another copy.

We jumped too fast - believing that the other reviewers were perhaps too critical of the DVD quality.  The worst is true - they may have been too kind.

Not only does the DVD version lack the enhanced clarity we have come to expect from digital recordings - it also has technical flaws in the recording which causes occasional gaps and jumps in the video and audio.  It very honestly provides no better quality than our VHS version and has the additional technical flaws mentioned - on all DVD players I have tried it on.

I am disappointed in BBC for the quality - and disappointed in Amazon for continuing to distribute an article of such poor quality that it seems to have been poorly dubbed like a quick ripoff!

I would gladly pay BBC several times the current purchase price for a high quality reproduction of the original concert.  I am sure I am not alone.  C'mon Amazon - don't you have any influence on your suppliers?

2765926,3,B000NDEXFC,"I didn't want to reiterate what are basically accurate reviews already here, but I just got off the phone with Warner Home video.
I'm on my second DVD after having contacted Warner (referred to them by BBC America) about the missing bits on the DVD as mentioned by others. Let's be clear: the omission is obvious. We're not talking a decision to take a distinct section out, it's a segment from the middle of a song that's missing. I had contacted them earlier this year and, after months of back and forth, received a replacement that I was assured fixed the problem.
It did not.
After finally being able to watch the DVD, I saw that the exact same errors were present (Gavroche and ""Little People,"" etc.). In addition. I found another problem I didn't see in my quick glance through the reviews here.

The original release of the concert was on a double-sided, double layer DVD, with Act 1 on one side, Act 2 on the second. This DVD is on a single-sided DVD. How did they do this? By atrociously high video compression. There are a lot of blacks in the concert as a result of it being performed on a stage with a darkened background. The posterization effect that results from the high compression (where the shading changes are abrupt rather than gradual) are quite glaring and distracting.

Anyway, I've contacted Warner again; their initial response was ""that's how it is,"" which is just silly.

It's a shame; I love Les Miserables, and this is truly a great version--the only way it could have been better would have been if it had been a complete version of the play.

But I'd loaned out my original DVD (the previous release) to someone who made off with it; I think it's better enough (compared to this one) that I'm going to order a replacement, despite the quite high cost.",1225929600,4,1784,4.565625

I have been in the Military for ten years  and this musical keeps my sanity straight when i listen to it every so often. I have seen the play and received the dvd  concert with digital surround  (dts) released by WELL GO USA  that my fiance got me, that has two separate disc a part 1 and 2 with no english subtitles. Then my fiance and i were ecstatic to find that there was a new dvd with the concert in one disc, which includes interviews of how it was made. I was sold and my fiance wanted a copy and  so we got one online. After receiving it and finally had time to enjoy the concert in one dvd without interruption, i found that there was a screw up between 25 and 26 on act two when Gavroche sings Little People. The screw up was already mentioned on the other reviews so let me tell you how it ruined my night. First i was going to break the dvd i felt like why would somebody do such a thing. For something that well known of a musical ,how can someone get so careless and miss a whole part of it. The little boy Gavroche is one of my favorites too. Second this disappointment caused me irritation through the nite that i couldn't sleep. I had a feeling of discomfort, i guess after years of being in the military you get used to a life expectancy that when something goes wrong it interrupts my way of thinking and how i feel.

Les Mis is one of my favourite musicals and I listen to the concert CD soundtrack all the time. I was looking forward to getting this on DVD so that I could watch it with DVD quality audio, which would be a vast improvement over the original VHS release. Boy, was I ever wrong with that assumption.

The audio is embarassingly terrible, with actual distortion in the mix. The original 2CD soundtrack to the concert sounds infinitely better, so there is no excuse for a new DVD release to actually sound worse. Somehow, they managed it with this.

And the commemorative booklet that comes inside is a joke! Grainy screenshots and the same old regurgitated text does not a commemorative booklet make. Once again the packaging doesn't live up to the CD packaging, which came with a marvelous booklet that was truly special.

And then there is the issue of footage being cut out which is, quite simply, a blunder of the highest order. Skip this, send the message that this travesty of a release should not be tolerated.",1211760000,107,1264,4.579646017699115
2766007,5,B000NDEXFC,"Having seen Les Miserables in London years ago I fell in love with what I consider the greatest musical of all times. I saw the 10th anniversary concert on PBS and once again was overwhelmed. Now, the concert is available on DVD and I can't be strong enough in my encouragement for you to buy this concert. The talent involved is the very best. It is such an encouraging and moving story of forgiveness performed by some of the greatest who performed in the musical in past years. How they got all these people together for this one great performance at London;s Royal Albert Hall is a work of genius. You will not be disappointed. This is a real keeper and you'll play it over and over. What talent...what music...what joy!!!!",1210464000,,727,4.557251908396947
2766008,5,B000NDEXFC,"This may be my favorite recording of all time.  Amazing story and simply the best cast.  The performances are absolutely top-notch.  Be aware, though, that this is not the musical in its entirety.  This is a concert performance and certain scenes and songs are omitted.  The quality of the cast and performances is more than enough to make up for it.  And I love the encores.

If you want, try before you buy by checking this out from your local library.",1209945600,2,454,4.530864197530864
2766009,5,B000NDEXFC,"Hadn't watched the VHS of this in a while, and forgot how much fun ""Master of the House"" was.  I think I actually first saw this on PBS.  I guess, though, if you are going to own one version of Miz, you may as well make it this one.  I personally found it jaw-droppingly good.  The bonus disc is wonderful as well.  I really don't get into musicals (I'm sort of a closet musical fan...certain ones capture me, others I could care less) per se, I mean, this is the only one I own on DVD and VHS (bought Cats on VHS to see what the hype was all about), but this is awesome.  Part of the reason I bought it, to be honest, is I had read the book (unabridged version) and loved the book.  I feel the musical captures the spirit of the book completely.  This a wonderful roller-coaster of emotions.  Live it, love it.  VIVE LES MISERABLES!!!",1209168000,2,835,4.1625

2766022,5,B000NDEXFC,"I first saw, and taped, this performance on WETA (PBS channel) and loved it. I've never seen the actual musical but the way this concert is produced -- from set design and staging to the costumed characters and ""acting"" -- I almost believe I saw the Broadway play. I bought the DVD when my VHS finally wore out; it's definitely a must-have for any musical lover.",1208649600,,362,4.5
2766023,2,B000NDEXFC,"Frankly, I found this product can do little but disappoint.  The singing is, of course, superb; however, this is a CONCERT, not a real production.  Seeing the actors standing on a stage in front of microphone can't possibly do the work justice (especially after having seen the musical on Broadway).  Personally, I think purchasing a recording would be far more effective since it won't provide the negative imagery of the characters standing on stage not engaging each other in any meaningful way (not to mention the recordings of this performance can be found at far more reasonable prices).",1208390400,2,593,5.030612244897959

2766025,5,B000NDEXFC,"This DVD seats  you in the front row center of the Royal Albert theater. The DVD wonderfully creates the magic and awe of Les Miz. Voices were strong ( Although I thought Colm
Wilkinson was weak in some aspects.....overall,, tho, he was magnificent!) Master of the House  is one of my least favorites in the show but hilarious in this version. Overall, well worth the money!",1207353600,,374,4.651515151515151
2766026,4,B000NDEXFC,"Having recently seen a live performance in London, I was excited to see this 10th Anniversary performance with the original cast members on DVD. The performances, backed by a full symphony orchestra and chorus were excellent and reminded me of how majestic and emotionally involving this play is. I especially appreciated the positive, for a change, image of Christianity presented and the themes of forgiveness and atonement that give emotional impact to the story. The video quality is a little less than current standards due to the age of the original recordings and those not familiar with the play may not be able to follow the story, since only the songs are performed. However, for those already familiar with the play, this is as good as it gets! Highly recommended.",1207267200,3,775,4.969230769230769

This Concert is an emotional roller coaster ride  that left me wanting to see it all over again. The vocal performances are superb, from all the lead characters.

The finale is a treat with 17 Jean ValJean characters from all the productions world wide performing the rousing ""DO YOU HEAR THE PEOPLE SING"".

2766051,5,B000NDEXFC,"All I can really say is that you MUST get this dvd.  It's wonderful to come back to this music again.  I had forgotten how amazing it is(of course, we community theatre peeps were going to kill ourselves if we heard yet another ""On My Own"" or ""I Dreamed a Dream"" for auditions).

Now my daughter is singing ""Castle On a Cloud"" like I did when I was young.  It warms my heart to share this musical with her.  It opens up many life conversations and opportunites to be close.

Buy it now, you won't regret it.  To hear and see this music performed the way it was intended is an experience like no other.

Philip Quast as Javert wins my vote for best performer.  I could watch him sing ""Stars"" and ""Javert's Suicide"" over and over again!",1206662400,4,734,4.260869565217392

The ""Master of the House"" was done exceptionally well and it was obvious that everyone was having a good time. Michael Ball is perfect as Marius. I would have liked to see a bit more animation from Ruthie Henshall as Fantine, but her voice cannot be faulted. Since the actual show is not available, this is the next best thing...",1206230400,2,445,4.439024390243903
2766055,3,B000NDEXFC,"I have the previous DVD release of this concert, and I love the music and sound, but the picture quality was a big disappointment: it's quite poor on an HDTV since it's shown in 4:3 standard definition format. I was excited to see this widescreen release, but after reading that the audio is only in stereo, I'm going to have to pass.

I have had the HD broadcast saved onto my DVR for the last two years, and it's sooo much better than the DVD. I long for a Blu-ray edition that will give this magnificent production the visual and audio treatment that it deserves.",1205798400,2,566,4.390476190476191
2766056,4,B000NDEXFC,"This new edition of the Les Miserables 10th Anniversary Concert (taped in 1995 at the Royal Albert Hall in London) is a welcome new edition for any person who found the original concert enjoyable and thrilling. The 2-DVD set comes in a good quality hard case with new artwork. The performances continue to be mostly excellent and one really does not miss the staging too much. There are several new positive additions to this edition. First is the wide-screen presentation of the concert. It was painfully obvious at certain points during the original release (especially the bigger numbers) that you were missing some of the singers on the sides. The new wide-screen presentation opens up the experience so you can watch the concert as it was originally taped. The second positive aspect of this issue is that the whole concert is on one side of one disk, which makes it much more convenient to watch. The third is the inclusion of the ""Stage By Stage"" Documentary from the late 80s tracking the recording of the Complete Symphonic Recording as a supplement on the second disk. Finally, for those who want to, you can follow along with new (optional) on-screen lyrics.

However, this edition is not without its disappointments. The first and by far the biggest disappointment is how it's only presented in stereo and not Dolby Digital 5.1 or better. Not having a digital audio option in 2008 is ridiculous and I would have greatly put up with changing disks if it meant having a better quality performance. The second disappointment is the deletion of parts of the concert previously available, which include part of ""Little People"" and the speeches by the creative talent behind the show at the end of the concert before the encore. Even if space was limited on the first disk, these deletions could have easily been put on the second disk as supplementary material.

So, while the concert itself continues to be quite enjoyable and there are some new additions that makes it a must have for any Les Miserable fan, there are some basic disappointments that keep this edition from being perfect.",1203811200,280,2096,4.851955307262569
2766057,3,B000NDEXFC,"Wow, I have waited forever for this concert to be released on DVD, I have worn out two VHS tapes, and I can't express my disapointment. It arrived today and my wife and I disconected the phones and prepared to watch on our new 1080p with a Blu-Ray player. The DVD is very grainy a lot of the time, like looking through a screen, much of the time there are ghosts around the actors. It appears to be simply a copy of the VHS with no enhancement. It has been edited, for instance Gavroche's song exposing Javert to the students has been shortened, the entire part between the end of the concert and the entrance of the international Jean Valjeans has been cut. (It may be on the second disc, but if it is then the ""additional material"" is misleading) In this day of digital enhancement there is no excuse for this poor quality, my old VHS is superior. The sound track is not enhanced at all. I will only hope someone will eventually offer a real quality DVD of this great, great event.
Post Script to my original review: I just rented the 1996 version DVD from netflix and it is superb, all of the criticisms I made of the 2008 DVD are much better on this version. I heartily suggest you get on the inter-net and locate this 1996 DVD. This is DEFINITELY the dream cast!!",1203465600,192,1268,4.331932773109243
2766058,5,B000NDEXFC,"This IS a great performance of the musical, but do note that this is not a new release of this production.  A DVD with this same production was released a number of years ago when they were not able to double layer a DVD way they current do, i.e., with this one you can see the entire performance without having to flip over the DVD (Nice!).

Also this DVD comes with an extra documentary about the ""making of the performance"".  I am not sure if there are any other extras.

The performance itself is not a fully staged production, but very nicely  presented with the performers standing at stage front in costume. The final encore with 17 different Valjeans from world wide productions singing ""Do You Hear the People Sing?"" in their native language is truly memorable and ""worth the price of admission"".

Enjoy!",1203465600,14,813,4.611111111111111
2766059,3,B000NDEXFC,"I absolutely love this concert! It has some wonderful music, and the very best singers around. I own the original DVD and am very happy with it. The reason I bought this copy was because it was in widescreen format, and I hoped it would offer a better viewing experience - to make you feel more like you were there. It accomplishes this nicely! Unfortunately, there is an error in the video transfer and a small section of singing is omitted. In the section where Gavroche (the little boy) exposes Javert as a spy, and sing's ""Little People"" - the part of the song where he sings, ""Good evening Inspector, lovely evening my dear...his name's Inspector Javert"" this whole section has been left out - and it is quite obvious! I thought maybe it was a defect on my copy but I have seen another copy and this same error is present. Maybe I'm too picky, but I expect perfection when it comes to my DVD's, and this is just too careless a mistake on the publisher's part.",1203379200,98,964,4.421348314606742

I love Amazon't virtually instant replacement of my first disk (less that 24 hours over a weekend), but both the first and the replacement copy had the same problem - neither will play the first half of the concert in my Sony blu-ray players or on my PC.

The box of the first one shipped had space for two DVDs, but only one was in the box (with a small marking of ""II"" suggesting disk 2 of 2).  So, obviously (to me), I was missing a disk.  The replacement shipment had identical box labeling (neither one said how many disks), but space for only 1 DVD, which was identically marked with ""II"".  Again, I could only persuade the dvd players and PC to play Act II.

When I use Windows Explorer to examine the files on the disk, there are files that appear to be both acts, buy nothing that Windows could play directly, so I gave up.

NOW, I read some of the other reviews and find that it may be a DVD Region issue - disk intended for UK (although after the FBI warning, there is a credit screen for the disk producer ""Well Go USA"").
