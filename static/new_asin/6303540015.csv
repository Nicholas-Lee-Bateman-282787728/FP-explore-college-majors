Muppet Babies tapes are 1.00 or 4.00 at the most, but all we can get is 3 Eureeka;s Castle shows on 3 tapes for 75.00 - 200.00 ...For 3 VHS tapes?  I own them all, but not happy I had to dish out 75.00 to get 3 VHS tapes!",1393459200,,434,3.9204545454545454
7851006,2,6303540015,"I purchased this as a gift, so I have not watched it myself. I can only hope it works properly. My issue is with the way the product is shown. I expected the actual jacket-- like the one in the description. And for the price I paid I certianly expect some sort of bootleg cover if you are going to be sketchy about the description. Very not impressed, it better play.",1324252800,,367,4.183098591549296
7851007,5,6303540015,"my brother and i have had a copy of this special taped off the television since we were very little. i bought him this for his 23rd birthday which is on thanksgiving, so that now we can stop watching the old video that will surely break if we watch it anymore. so glad to have this! as for the thing itself, kids will love it - great songs and life lessons that stay with you through to adulthood, as my brother and i are quick to reminisce about them. ""Put it on the list!"" :-P",1258848000,,478,4.042105263157895
