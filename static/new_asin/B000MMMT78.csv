8170211,1,B000MMMT78,"Mysterious Island of Beautiful Women, 1977 film

It opens with explosions and shooting. Nuns with children run to a twin-engine airplane that flies away. Years later there is an equipment malfunction during a thunderstorm on the two-engine flying boat, it flies low over the ocean. They see an island in the ocean and land on the water. Will they be found? Do they have guns? Night falls, they light a fire. The women on the island pray. A native throws a spear at an armed man (for drama). The women on the island seem friendly. Two men explore inland and observe the women. Are those women mean? Those women show up with spears and take the dead native. The story runs on with conversations among the people.

The women worry about the head choppers. A woman cuts down coconuts. She sees head choppers paddling ashore. They took the two bodies and left. Will they be back tomorrow? The men check their pistols. One of the women warn them. They want to visit sister, their leader. One man finds the old airplane that crashed years ago and searches it. He finds an old journal that tells what happened in 1954 and afterwards. Some of the women want to kill a man, but he talks them out of it and frees the other men. The next morning they discuss the past. Three boats approach the shore, they run towards the PBY on the beach. Can they start the engines? Can they take off? They fly away.

Is this the most simple-minded movie youve ever seen? A good movie needs a good plot. The only worthwhile part is the use of pistols to stop killers. Where did they dig out a WW II PBY for this movie? That is one unexplained mystery.",1519084800,,1624,4.424749163879599

8170214,5,B000MMMT78,"okay, I agree: it's cheesy.  Also the acting really sucks.  but I gave it 5 stars because the story is so good.  It really has the potential to be a great movie with the right actors.  Also the title is unbelievably stupid!  It was because of this title that I nearly missed out on the movie. I remember it was on TV, and, because of the title, I thought ""oh brother!"" but there was nothing else on, so I figured I'd just take a nap.  But the story was good and kept me awake. I wish they'd do a remake of this movie, but since it bombed when it came out, that's not very likely.

Wait a second. Someone said that this movie shows no skin?  I don't know what movie they were watching, because this movie has plenty of skin.  Ok maybe not by today's standards, but yeah their outfits are plenty skimpy.",1368057600,4,801,4.14935064935065
8170215,5,B000MMMT78,"This movie is a classic, if you like the 1970's made for tv movies. Clint Walker did a fine job and the girls were beautiful.great movie to watch late night.",1325030400,2,157,4.266666666666667
8170216,4,B000MMMT78,"This is rather a slight film, but the presence of Jayne Kennedy, the most beautiful woman to ever walk the earth, makes it worth seeing.  I saw it when it originally aired and never forgot it.  Another old favorite, Clint Walker, does what he can with the meager script.",1289347200,2,270,4.489795918367347
8170217,1,B000MMMT78,The Cover has Clint Walker listed first as the star. He was not the star and he had only a small part. I was really disgusted. I wasted my money.,1252713600,,145,3.8666666666666667
8170218,1,B000MMMT78,"An embarrassing, exploitive movie. I only bought it because I'm such a Clint Walker fan. He looks great, & I guess he did the best he
could with a crummy part, but it wasn't one of his better career choices. Surprising, because I understand he was usually very picky
about his projects. This was a bad move.",1248912000,,307,4.4035087719298245
8170219,1,B000MMMT78,This movie has the look of a made for TV movie.  It DOES NOT have anybody in a skimpy bikini.  If you were hoping to see skin... Don't bother.,1216252800,9,142,3.8620689655172415
