7788627,5,0767021983,"This episode of A&E Biography covers the life and crimes of one of the most prolific and darkly fascinating serial killers of all time.  It's not every homicidal maniac who hobnobs with governors and First Ladies of the United States - but John Wayne Gacy did.  Along with Ted Bundy, Gacy put the lie to the popular notion that serial killers should somehow stand out in society.  A successful contractor, Gacy was a dedicated volunteer with the Junior Chamber of Commerce, entertained children as ""Pogo the Clown,"" and even served as a Democratic precinct captain.  He married twice and was reportedly a loving and nurturing father.  No one suspected that he was hiding a lifetime of sick sexual urges that would lead him to sexually molest and kill thirty-three young men and bury them all on his property (most of them in the crawlspace under his house).

This documentary does an excellent job of describing Gacy's life - both public and private.  Interviews with his sister and a best friend from childhood reveal the manifestation of his problems and sexual confusion at an early age - and the promise of a successful adult life sabotaged by Gacy's insatiable sexual appetite.  Still, he was not necessarily destined to become a murderer.  He and his first wife indulged in the swinger lifestyle, and he excelled at recruiting members for the Jaycees by hosting parties featuring porn and prostitutes.  Then, while his family was away, he invited the fifteen-year-old son of a fellow Jaycee and state senator to his house, showed him a stag film, got him drunk, and had oral sex with him, buying his silence with fifty bucks and the threat of violence.  This disgusting little escapade earned him a sodomy conviction and a ten-year prison sentence.  Ever the socialite, Gacy did well in prison, earning the job of head cook after eight months and winning his release after a mere sixteen months of incarceration.  This documentary features a clip of a news interview with Gacy discussing the Christmas dinner menu he was preparing for his fellow inmates.

Gacy seemed to turn his life around after prison.  After moving in with his mother, he got a job as a short order cook; within the next two years, he started his own contracting company and got remarried.  He would soon be entertaining children as Pogo the Clown and serving as a Democratic precinct captain.  Unbeknownst to those around him, though, he had already become a killer.  The first killing, in January 1972, may have been an impulsive act, but Gacy seemingly enjoyed the power of taking someone's life - and it was a sure way of preventing his young male rape victims from talking.  The killing urge took him over completely after his wife left him, resulting in the deaths of 33 teenaged boys and young men, most of them conveniently buried under the crawlspace of his house.

The documentary paints a vivid picture of Gacy as a supremely confident killer whose own arrogance proved his undoing.  After being questioned about a recent disappearance, and knowing full well that he was a prime suspect under constant surveillance by the police, he had the audacity to invite a couple of the cops who were watching him into his house for a fish fry.  One of them detected the odor of decay coming out of the air vents, and the rest is history.  His not-so-secret stash of dead bodies led to his conviction and execution for multiple counts of murder.

You hear a lot from Gacy himself in this documentary, as it features a number of clips from prison interviews he gave before his execution.  Gacy did not fit the standard psychological profile for a serial killer at that time, so his testimony - and his prison artwork - has been studied carefully by psychologists and criminologists - as was his brain, which, according to the medical professional who performed Gacy's autopsy, showed no abnormalities that might explain why he became a serial killer.  As a ""monster in disguise,"" Gacy represents one of society's greatest dangers, and this documentary does a superb job of conveying what little we do know about his psychological makeup.  It doesn't dwell on the murders themselves, which may disappoint those with a particularly macabre interest in the case, but it offers quite a compelling portrait of the man who committed them.",1302393600,,4308,4.8497267759562845
7788628,3,0767021983,"JWG killed 33 men: the highest number for a serial killer in the US.  (The work doesn't say how a Soviet man killed about 50 victims before going to trial.)  The work focuses on his ability to hide.
The work says he was involved with a Jaycee group.  He was a businessman.  He took a photo with First Lady Carter.
Books and documentaries on Jeffrey Dahmer stated that he failed at almost everything he did.  JWG seemed to succeed in many aspects.
Other documentaries would have focused on the details of each murder.  This work says little about them.  The focus was more on his upbringing and his public life instead.  You never hear from the family members of any of his victims here.  In that way, the destruction he caused is not emphasized as it should have been.
Did the sex offender registration not exist!?  How does a man who went to prison for molesting children remarry, own a business, and become a public figure with no one knowing about his record?!  The work speaks about his paintings and the book he wrote.  I think there's a law now that prevents murderers from earning from their crimes.  Did that not exist before?  Was he the catalyst for that new rule?  This work never says.
The work interviews his sister, psychiatric experts, and legal representatives.  Dahmer works emphasize that the apartment building where he lived was demolished.  Did that happen to JWG's home?
The work concludes with a scientist saying she examined his brain after his execution and it showed no abnormalities.  The implication remains that no one will know how to identify his type from the rest of the public.
I haven't read any books on him or saw any bio-pics.  Those who have may have deeper analysis of this particular work to offer than I do.",1222473600,,1749,4.62012987012987
