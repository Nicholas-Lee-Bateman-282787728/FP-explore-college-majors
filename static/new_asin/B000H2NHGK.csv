8136060,5,B000H2NHGK,"I bought the entire Hope television collection - and love this snapshot of television history!  Bob Hope's television specials ran for over 40 years - and are a terrific nostalgic look at the trends, politics, and stars of the times.  Great clean humor to show kids so accustomed to today's fast paced and often disturbing television fare.",1154908800,,339,4.9298245614035086
