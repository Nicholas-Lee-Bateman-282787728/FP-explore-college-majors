8421839,3,B004BAUDF2,"Emphasis is on conspiracy plots and action, but there is some dialog and even some humor. An international cast dubbed in French, but mostly set in the US, although there are frequent globe-trotting scenes. This TV series is a co-production by Canada, France, and Belgium. I used it to improve my listening comprehension in French as there are NO subtitles, not even French ones for the hearing impaired. It plays fine on my OPPO with region-free settings or on a computer, but do be aware that this is the Region 2 (European) version and will NOT play on most US DVD players unless they have a setting/option for region-free. In terms of quantity of content, this is quite the bargain, with all 22 episodes from season one and all 11 episodes from the second and final season. This is around 30 hours of viewing!",1454284800,2,813,4.652777777777778
