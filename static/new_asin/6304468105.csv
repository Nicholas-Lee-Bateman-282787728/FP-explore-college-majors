I would happily purchase in CD disk, but notice that the product is sold in VHS!!? VHS?? Who has a CD player these days? Obviously these memories are for the few collectors who own old VHS players, or our dreams that take us back.",1520467200,,327,4.466666666666667
7874715,5,6304468105,"I bought the two videos years ago - Volumes I and II.  In fact, I eventually bought two sets and share them with any Bostonians I meet.
I keep waiting for Volume III.  PLEASE do something about that.  We're all waiting.  Great nostalgic videos for the greatest generation or anyone who lives in or has lived in Boston.",1380844800,,318,4.431034482758621
