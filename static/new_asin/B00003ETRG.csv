7918755,5,B00003ETRG,"Truly a one-of-a-kind actress.  Margot's career (and life, for that matter) is one of the most interesting ever to emerge from Hollywood.  Margot, along with costars, friends and family, discusses the incredible  high and low points she's endured over the past few decades with humor,  honesty and warmth.  When I was five years old, I remember seeing Superman:  The Movie in theaters for the first time and saying, ""Mommie, WHO is  THAT! ""  At that moment, I developed a permanent crush on Lois  Lane which has since developed into great respect and admiration.  It's  very exciting to see her best movies being released on DVD this year  (Superman, Sisters, Quackser Fortune has a Cousin in the Bronx) and it's  even more exciting to see her working steadily again (Common Ground, Annihilation of Fish, Crime and Punishment).  Not to  mention the release of her long-in-progress book, ""Calamities""  (in October... finally! )  Brunette leading ladies may come and go, but  there is only one Margot.  I highly recommend adding Margot Kidder's  ""Intimate Portrait"" to your collection.",959126400,7,1083,5.114942528735632
