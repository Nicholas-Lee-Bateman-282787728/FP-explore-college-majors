7813589,5,6301647327,"This is one of my all time favorites and I wish they would release it on DVD as I would buy this in an instant. The movie is silly but that is what makes it enjoyable. Too many comedy's today are not just stupid, but vulgar and very low brow.  So movies like this that can be funny without foul language and naked women should be applauded.  There are times you want to think while be entertained but when you just want to free your mind and have some laughs this is the kind of movie you need.  I do not think anyone in the movie has any real acting skills but then again it was not written to win an Oscar, but to have some fun.",1307923200,,630,3.9448818897637796

7813591,5,6301647327,"I absolutely love this movie.......it's been a while since i've seen it. I think i'm going to buy it, and watch it again. My nephew and I used to sit and watch it, when I worked in a video store.....It would just play all day long..........We just bought a puppy in October, and I went to the pet store and bought a toy called, ""THE CHICKEN BONE"".  My dog now knows this toy as, ""CHICKEN BONE, CHICKEN BONE, LUCKY, LUCKY, CHICKEN BONE""  He'll pick it up, and bring it to you!!!!!  Some things you just never forget...............",1208995200,,529,4.43298969072165

7813593,4,6301647327,"This movie, for what it is, is terrific! No, it's not exactly a Hollywood blockbuster, but it wasn't meant to be, and anyone who has half a brain can see that!

 The cheesy plot, the predictable lines, and the completely overplayed parts are exactly right for this type of movie. I was hooked by this movie from the beginning, and not just because of the very nice looking twins. Something about them just made me want to see them succeed. It actually appealed to me more when I watched it again years after the first time because I used to work in a truck stop and I saw a lot of the facets of the truckers in the movies in reality there. Sure, they were overblown in the movie, but still...

 ""Bull"" with hair, two big, dumb-but-lovable guys, a kid in trouble, and a race against the clock... what more could you want?

 If you like to laugh, you aren't expecting a high brow comedy, and you're lucky enough to get your hands on a copy, you really should give it a try!",1090627200,,971,4.278688524590164
7813594,1,6301647327,"I don't find anything funny about 2 massive body builders who act like a couple of kids. A girl who is a genious gets mixed up with 2 moron's and they are there to help save the day. That big guy who played Jaws in a couple of the Bond films was probably the best actor in the whole movie. This movie didn't appeal to me, but it probably would appeal to a much younger audience, as it was intended to i think.
I found it to be silly, stupid, bad acting.... but the kids might love it, these two brothers hitting each other and pretending it hurt, when you can see that they are lightly tapping things and badly done... a goofy movie can work, but this one just didn't for me.",1085443200,,675,4.082706766917293
7813595,5,6301647327,"I love David and Peter Paul.  Not only are they very hot, but they have shown a great sense of humor in the two movies I've seen them in.  I wish they had done more.",1032912000,,165,3.6857142857142855
7813596,5,6301647327,These guys are great together!  I first watched them in DC Cab and since they have become my greatest twin actors.  I like their sense of humar and the fact that they are into clean honest fun!!!!!,1029369600,,197,4.297297297297297
