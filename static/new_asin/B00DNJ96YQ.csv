8594990,5,B00DNJ96YQ,"I find Conspiracy and Aftermath both very informative and insightful documentaries. If anyone is wondering whether or not to order this very Double Feature dvd, I'll tell you this; click it into your cart because you won't regret it, at least that's my own personal opinion and I always speak from my heart; you will never find me saying I like something if I truly don't. I'm always honest, I'm ""frank"".

About the latter; Frank, as in Alexander; he gives us viewers great insight on what happened back then, on a deeper level, and you really take it all to your heart as you get a clearer picture on what went down and the things he himself went through. Who knows it better than the man himself, Tupac's own personal bodyguard; and that he fought so hard to tell people about it and fought for the justice of Tupac says alot; a true friend and brother who truly wanted to find the killer who took Tupac's life. We will know, one day, even though some may find it hopeless; I'll say; without these documentaries, it would be even harder - RJ Bond, Frank Alexander, everyone involved should be thanked for such hard work and GREAT work for fighting to find an answer and for looking into this deeper.

If you love Tupac and you're a TRUE fan then you will want to watch these documentaries; and as this is a double feature; it's a great buy. What I also love about the documentaries is that you get alot of information about Tupac and his life, and even though most Tupac fans feel that they most probably know it all about him and where he was heading; this brings you further into his ideas and you feel a whole lot of love for the man. I really do like what I have watched and I know that I will be watching these documentaries again - because when something is that good; it's just really THAT good and I find it important to really pay close attention to what's given to us; if you are a fan of Tupac Shakur, you will support this and you will add this dvd to the cart and end up here writing your very own review; who knows what you will think about the documentaries, let amazon know, let the people know, but this is what I think. So, why don't you see it for yourself and express your personal opinion too?

I gave this five stars, would have definitely given more if I could.

And I do want to add that Frank Alexander, my friend, is deeply missed. He passed 2013 for those that don't know. So, it would also be a great tribute to him to watch these. I will add that I smile knowing I can watch him in all these 2Pac documentaries, and hear him speak. And his voice shall continue to speak through them, years to come because there will always be new Tupac fans, young and older, who will want to know what went down, as they want better understanding and they want the TRUTH, and if anyone brings that to you; it's Frank, as his name itself means ""truthful"" - Fans want an answer, we ALL do, it's been years -- so how good it is to know that the case isn't closed completely because no matter what; these documentaries are out there and they really speak!

Now go on, you watch it now - and don't forget Frank's book: ""Got Your Back - Protecting Tupac in the World of Gangsta Rap"" which will give you insight as well just as will: ""Before I wake"", the dvd documentary.
