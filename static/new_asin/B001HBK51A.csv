3628761,5,B001HBK51A,"The cover picture put me off a little. Combined with the description it looked like a jerk with a superficial life. Now that may have ended up being so if this was Holywood but Indian movies have a way of going ddeper and looking at what people are learning about life and ethics.
So the plot ended up being very satisfying. He really gets a chance to learn about his effects on other and how they respond to his dumping them from their diffferent personalities and ways of coping.
While the way he does it is fantasy the effect is of someone really examining their responsibily and growing. Iliked the feel of that.
The location shots are really beautiful and the acting good.
I personally found the hero a bit bland and bewildered at times but he ends up being quite likeable.
The standout thing about this movie for me too is the music. There are quite a few catchy tunes that were with me well after. You rarely get so many on the one soundtrack that I ended up buying the soundtrack.
Well worth the journey particualarly if you like catchy modern Indian music.",1225497600,4,1065,4.466666666666667

3628764,5,B001HBK51A,"I thought this movie was a little slow at first, but if you keep watching, its worth the wait. At first, you want to hate Ranbir's character, but he really redeems himself later on in the movie. I was very impressed with the songs--they were everything you expect in a Bollywood movie (vibrant colors, dancing, traditional dress). The story line was good, also. Overall, watching this movie was an enjoyable experience.",1297382400,,419,4.915492957746479
3628765,2,B001HBK51A,"Purchased movie because of raving reviews by others. After 45 minutes into the movie, I became mystified as to why someone would give a 5 star rating. Simply put, movie was choppy, lacked entertainment value, and the dialogues sucked. During the second half, I realized this  movie is actually a (cheap) spin off of Bill Murrays movie ""Broken Flowers"". Movie is nothing compared to rab ne bana di jodi (a true 5 star movie). Gave it 2 stars rather than one because some of the background scenery in the beginnig was nice and also bipasha's lucky boy video. Only watched the whole movie because picture and audio quality was great on my Pioneer KURO plasma and Krell/Mark Levinson audio gear.",1292025600,,691,4.758333333333334

3628767,5,B001HBK51A,"... else heat from Bipasha Basu and Deepika Padukone would melt it because Minissha Lambda, Kunal Kapoor and Ranbir Kapoor do nothing to cool it off.

While not every thing that happens in this film is a big surprise, the story is fresh and mostly unpredictable after an odd beginning. Your might avoid review spoilers because the story is fun to see unfold. Minissha is innocent and lovely, Bipasha is exotic and sexy and Deepika is sweet and beautiful.

Ranbir Kapoor is extremely versatile, hitting full stride in this film.  Kunal Kapoor is featured more in Laaga Chanuri Mein Daag and Aaja Nachle - two very good films that I think are underrated because people are thinking too much.

The dancing in BAH ranges from technically difficult and energetic (Punjab sequence with Kunal, Minissha and Ranbir) through hot and sexy (Bipasha, Lucky Boy) to scenic and flowing (Deepika and Ranbir) with some must see scenery and camera work.  There is also, a cute street dance featuring Ranbir (Small Town Girl).  Title song (Bachena Ae Haseeno) features all three women and Ranbir with as traveling ""blue screen"" surprise.

The icing on the cake is Shreya Goshal, one of the excellent background singers.  Need I say more?",1266710400,,1219,4.912195121951219
3628768,5,B001HBK51A,"...this is a perfect introduction into what Bollywood is all about.  Beautiful women, FINE looking men (Ranbir Kapoor!), singing, dancing, music you can't stop humming, dance moves you will be trying to imitate in your living room!  Also a meaningful storyline that will make 3 hours fly by in no time.  I've watched this movie about 5-6 times now, and I'm not done yet.  I love it!",1265500800,,382,4.656716417910448
3628769,3,B001HBK51A,"""Beware, O Beautiful Ones,"" the title tells us--beware, indeed, because Ranbir Kapoor is already scorching his way to the top in this, his second film, and setting hearts on fire along the way. Kapoor--the grandson of the granddaddy of Indian film, actor Raj Kapoor, and the cousin of actress Kareena Kapoor--has the talent to match his pedigree and it shows even in this predictable, albeit entertaining movie about a commitment-phobe who gets a comeuppance.

But the real star of the show is Bipasha Basu, in a role she was born to play--that of a driven superstar who might be hurt by heartache, but can't be stopped by anything. Although she doesn't share screen time with the other two female leads--Deepika Padukone and Minissha Lamba--they pale in comparison to her. She even comes close to overshadowing the very engaging Kapoor, with whom she's extremely mismatched--it stretches believability that a bombshell like her would even be interested in a boy-man like him, however adorable he might be, or that he'd do anything less than worship her. Instead, he dumps her. Right.

We meet Kapoor's character, Raj, as a teenager, when he breaks the heart of Mahi (Lamba), a sweet girl with whom he shares a kiss and promises of forever while vacationing in Switzerland. She catches him bragging to his friends--and thoroughly exaggerating--about their time alone together and he leaves her, crushed, at the airport. Six years later, he's a software developer in Mumbai living with his girlfriend Radhika (Basu), an aspiring model. Once again, Raj is cavalier about the relationship, and when his company wants to transfer him to Australia, he sees it as an easy way out of his domestic arrangement. But Radhika doesn't make it easy--she assumes they're going to get married and move there together. Instead of breaking up with her, he skips out on the wedding. Five years later, he's loving bachelorhood--and all the blonds--in Australia, until he meets Gayatri (Padukone), a knockout MBA student who works as a cab driver to pay the bills. Her hard-to-get act works, and he's smitten. But this time, it's his turn to get hurt. Wounded and wiser, he realizes how much pain he caused in the past and he sets out to find Mahi and Radhika and apologize to them. His guilt is worsened when he discovers what's become of them--Mahi is in a perfunctory marriage and Radhika is a cold and cruel world-famous model. Of course, neither is eager to give him the forgiveness he badly craves and he must work to earn it.

All in all, it's a cute story about an improbably lucky and likable rogue with a lot of growing up to do.

3628770,4,B001HBK51A,"This is great movie! Did I say that already? Ranbir Kapoor, although not terribly handsome (in my opinion), totally won my heart. Good dancer!! Really cute and funny actor. Nice story. Although Bipasha & Deepika are well-known hotties, I think the actress who plays ""Mahi"" is awfully cute. Check out the scene where Raj & Mahi share their first kiss.. sweet! The music is of course terrific! Not a single bad song in the movie.",1241827200,2,427,4.706666666666667
3628771,4,B001HBK51A,"Ranbir Kapoor proves himself worthy of the Kapoor name in this charming film.  Told as a series of three vignettes, Ranbir Kapoor's charactor (Raj) learns about life and grown-up relationships.  The three actresses who play his girlfriends all do a fantastic job - with Bipasha Basu as the real stand-out - and the music is also top notch.

While ""Bachna ae Haseeno"" is by no means a deep meaningful film, it is a fun and well made one.  I highly recommend it.",1226707200,6,460,4.573170731707317

It works in my computer dvd player (i haven't tried playing it in anything else) but the films picture quality is a little low.

8308489,5,B001HBK51A,"The first time I watched this movie I thought it was just OK. Maybe it had to do with what was going on in my life at the time, or I wasn't really in the mood for it. After chancing it a second time, though, I love this movie! It's a movie with lessons to be learned, especially by Ranbir Kapoor's character, Raj, but also by the three women he meets. The chemistry between Ranbir and Deepika Padukone was just right. The songs were very good, with Khuda Jaane being my favorite, with it's very romantic, almost soulful sound. And then there's Jogi Mahi, which I can't keep still through--I can watch Ranbir's dance moves forever! I thought this was a great movie that made ME feel great in the end!",1424908800,,699,4.343511450381679
8308490,3,B001HBK51A,"Ranbir is good in this; he acts and  dances well. Songs and dances are very good. But this movie is far from great. Ranbir and the three female leads have zero chemistry. Bipasha is actually too mature to be paired with him. This is no Rakhee/Rishi hookup from Doosra Admi. Deepika has acted with way older actors more convincingly and appears here to do Yashraj a favor. Yeah, I couldn't get pass the inappropriate casting. And could the plot get any more ludicrous. So Raj goes to make up and apologize to the two women he has wronged. It takes him six months. It seems like six months for me too. The worst moment came at the end. His girlfriend, a cab driver while carrying a fare to the airport, tells them to get out before reaching making them walk the rest of the way. She and Raj then continues with their make up/climactic scene and all the time I am thinking to myself how rude and selfish these characters are. UltimatelyRaj hasn't learned how to be a better person. Blame this lack of sensitivity on the writer and director. Still, three dim stars from me for the Bollywood song and dance numbers. Without these it would be a total zero.",1420329600,,1150,4.450236966824645

8308492,5,B001HBK51A,"One of the best movies I saw from Bollywood. The story is fresh, cool and original! Karma exist and i think is the story line of the movie. It's hard to choose how performance is better but definitely Kappor and  Deepika CHEMISTRY IS OUT OF THIS WORLD! I recommended. I love the music also. Khuda Jaane is my favorite song so far...",1404604800,,332,4.354838709677419
