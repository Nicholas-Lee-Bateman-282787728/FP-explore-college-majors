8563770,4,B00B7VLD16,"This is a film where the sound track was gutted and replaced with Shakespearean lines. Not quiet as funny as ""What's Up Tiger Lily?""  but it has its moments during the 62 minutes it is on the screen.  The 20 something girls and guys are supposed to be in High School. The killer wore a chef's outfit and there was no background on who or why he was killing. The football team wore generic shirts that said ""FOOTBALL PLAYER"" in case you forgot during all of their homosexual nonsense. The girls in this film like to shower and change clothes so there is plenty of Shakespearean nudity too. An appreciation for the Bard is not required to enjoy this film, but it helps.

8563772,1,B00B7VLD16,"""Bikini Bloodbath Shakespeare"" (Actual credit: ""Written by William Shakespeare; Directed and Adapted by John Reed"") is an absolutely atrocious ""movie"" which opens with a very Shakespearean girl's volleyball game and goes downhill from there. It's barely an hour long, but I have no doubt that you will find, as I did, that the running time is excessive. Highlights include music by ""White Liger,"" death among plastic pink flamingoes and a killer whale snow globe (surely this must hark back to ""King Lear,"") and an apparent tribute to Kenny Loggins' classic ""Footloose."" Before it's over you can find out why the quality of mercy is unstrained (oh, please,) and you will likely be wishing everyone could have fallen on their bare bodkins at the outset rendering it unnecessary for anyone to have to view this travesty.

The dubbing and sound quality are worthy of singling out for special scorn: many of the ostensibly hilarious lines are nearly inaudible, and sound levels are all over the place. Whether missing some of the precious dialogue detracts from the viewing experience or not is worthy of debate (I vote no,) but I will say that even after buying a movie with this title (I was not expecting a lot) and having seen thousands of genuinely awful films, this one is in the highest echelon of wretched cinema. You have been forewarned: a lost classic of the Bard's it most certainly is not.",1381795200,2,1398,4.873949579831932
