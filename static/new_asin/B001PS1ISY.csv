8334484,5,B001PS1ISY,"There is a lot of bang for the buck here.
Very informative and interesting.
The animations are pretty good, it is not Jurassic Park but more than adequate for this series.
I would definitely recommend.",1334620800,5,201,4.771428571428571
8334485,1,B001PS1ISY,THE ANIMATION WAS POOR COMPARED TO THE BBC DINOSAUR SERIES OR THE PREHISTORIC PARK SERIES.  THE NARRATION WAS BORING AND TURNED MY GRANDCHILDREN OFF. WE WATCHED 2 EPISODES AND PUT IT IN THE BOX TO SELL THE NEXT GARAGE SALE.,1308787200,6,223,4.575
