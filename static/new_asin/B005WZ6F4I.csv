4900001,5,B005WZ6F4I,"My yogini's are in love with their new Omolulu DVD and so am I!!! It as everything they would crave as children - clear/safe direction easy to understand for even my 2 year old son, happy children to watch, beautiful background color and a complete beautiful practice. As a Mum, I love watching (and even partaking) my children on their mat with this DVD in front of them. It is truly a thorough practice and symbolizes the beautiful harmony of our bodies and the earth - and those together. They have already learned so much about their bodies/minds and their needs without even knowing it because they are enjoying themselves so much.  The crispness and attention to detail is wonderful. The Omolulu DVD is a wonderful addition to our day!",1321574400,,741,4.7
4900002,5,B005WZ6F4I,"Yoga provides such a great tool for children to learn how to understand how their emotions and body interact.  This is a great DVD for teaching your child how to relax, how to implement breathing practices into their every day activities and how to have fun while getting exercise.

I would like to see more DVD's focused on families practicing yoga together.  This would be a great tool for after school programs or creating play time for a few children to interact in a controlled environment.

Need to make this an app for your phone!",1320105600,,537,4.621052631578947
4900003,5,B005WZ6F4I,My daughter likes that it actually has kids doing yoga instead of an adult. The voice can be VERY monotone but it doesn't bother her at all. There are several different practices and even one for a partner.,1424908800,,206,4.447368421052632
4900004,5,B005WZ6F4I,My kids loved this DVD. So fare it is the best yoga DVD for kids that we bought.,1422662400,,80,3.5
4900005,5,B005WZ6F4I,Great item! Got as a gift and person loves it!,1419984000,,46,3.7
4900006,5,B005WZ6F4I,"I used this with a group of students 7-9 and they LOVE it. It's the perfect introduction to Yoga. They had soo much fun following each exercise. I wished there were more DVDS to continue what they learned, but there aren't.",1402531200,2,223,4.463414634146342
4900007,5,B005WZ6F4I,"First off, yes - the woman has a monotone voice but try to get past it. In fact, I'm glad her voice is this way and that the video isn't all bells and whistles; because if you have children who are easily distracted, then they will focus on the bells and whistles and not practicing yoga.

I purchased this for our whole family to do because my oldest child has sensory issues along with ADHD / Anxiety. This was wonderful for him. He focused very well and enjoyed doing the exercises and at the end, he seemed very calm and peaceful. The children enjoy picking out which section of Yoga (Earth, Air, Water, Fire) they would like to do for the session.

The sessions are calming, relaxing and can be picked up quickly. I hope you enjoy the DVD as much as my family and I do!",1398211200,,774,4.258503401360544
4900008,5,B005WZ6F4I,"This is the best yoga DVD for kids that I have found.  We can chose from four different thematic sessions. The poses flow and are challenging enough for young children.  The kids ask for this DVD.  I enjoy it, as well.",1397347200,,218,4.2682926829268295
4900009,5,B005WZ6F4I,My sons who are three and six really got into this and found it easy enough to understand. They enjoy the music too.,1395705600,,116,4.086956521739131
4900010,4,B005WZ6F4I,"We use this video daily in my Pre-K class. Children are the example for each of the positions, which I like very much. The narrator's voice is rather monotone. The middle of my disk chipped and now I'm afraid to take it out of the player for fear it will not  play the next time I need it. I don't know if this is my fault or if the disk itself is low quality. I wish it came with a digital copy so I could just save it to my computer.",1393977600,,435,3.78021978021978
4900011,5,B005WZ6F4I,"This DVD has 4 15-minute sessions that are perfect for little ones' short attention spans.  The music is also very soothing and inspiring.  The woman speaking and guiding through the poses can be a bit monotone, but you get used to it. My 3 1/2 year old took to this very quickly and loves it!",1381104000,,293,4.3090909090909095
4900012,5,B005WZ6F4I,"This is a really great video.  Definitely worth the money. My 4 yr old daughter and I have used it daily since it arrived. I really like it because there is no extra distractions. No silly background animation or cartoon pop ups. It is pleasantly serious.  Even for novice adults like me, it introduces basic yoga.  Also great for parents and their kids to share in something healthy and invigorating that doesn't require a lot of extras. I think this was one of my better ""Mom"" choices!!",1379721600,2,488,4.586206896551724
4900013,5,B005WZ6F4I,This the the best yoga video I have seen.  The kids take center stage in this video - it had boys and girl both and puts a theme of the outdoor with it so as not to be too girly.  My boys love pretending to surf and it moves fast and isn't too long.  It has a flare of Hawaii and has a variety of exercise to follow.  There are 5 sessions so you are rotate when one you do without getting bored too fast.,1378944000,,404,3.7176470588235295
4900014,5,B005WZ6F4I,This yoga program delivers what it promises!  It has many different themes that interests the kids.  The sessions are short enough to keep the attention span of most children.  I highly recommend this program as it provides an opportunity for a lot of children to have some exposure to yoga.,1376870400,,291,4.78
4900015,2,B005WZ6F4I,"It is super boring with mono tone voice.  It is yoga for children, they should make it fun and interesting.

We have another dvd yoga for kids.  At least my kid will follow some of the exercises in that one.

This DVD is pretty expensive and my child won't even follow it once.",1375401600,,277,4.169811320754717
4900016,3,B005WZ6F4I,"I bought this DVD thinking that it was filmed outside in nature. I was mistaken, it's filmed entirely inside, which was disappointing considering it was filmed in Hawaii. I wish it had used beautiful Hawaiian beaches for a backdrop. The yoga and children in the DVD are great. The narrator's voice can get annoying. She is very monotone. My children have liked doing the yoga however.",1374451200,,384,4.833333333333333
4900017,5,B005WZ6F4I,"A colleague asked me to do some yoga with her son and another colleague's special needs children.  I put it off for a long time since I only have experience teaching adults.  I read other reviews on Amazon and decided to check out this DVD for guidance and was very pleased.  It offers four 15 minute sequences~""Earth"" for grounding, ""Fire"" for energizing, etc. ""Air"" has some very sweet partner poses and emphasizes connecting with others while also respecting each others space.  Each sequence has a different child demonstrating the poses.  They can be used as stand-alone practices for short attention spans, or linked together.  The music played at the beginning and end is also very catchy!  It's still stuck on my brain, in fact!  Om, may I be happy, peaceful, kind...not the worst thing to have on one's mind",1370822400,,816,4.820143884892087
4900018,5,B005WZ6F4I,I got this for my niece and her little girl and they love it. My little grand niece likes to do it in the evening and before school in the morning. She can be calm and healthy.,1370304000,,176,3.7837837837837838
4900019,5,B005WZ6F4I,"My daughter is 3 years old and she loves doing yoga along with Omolulu.  It is definitely the best of the children's yoga videos we have tried, (including ""Gaiam Yoga for Kids"" which has gotten some good reviews but disappointed us).

1. Love that the kids are the ones doing all the poses, with the adult voice instructing.  (Another reviewer didn't like the instructor's voice and called it monotone but to me it was just calm, not unpleasant.)

2. High quality set design and production make it a pleasure to view.

3. Well organized segments each 10-20 minutes long.

4. Nice music.

Well done, Omolulu!",1369785600,14,607,4.723809523809524
4900020,5,B005WZ6F4I,I have 8 1/2 and 10 1/2 year old children. My son's speech therapist recommend yoga for him. She said it would relax him and help him to articulate the sounds better by relaxing the muscles.  It totally worked! He loved the DVD and got his older sister hooked on it too! They like to line up their stuffed animals and teach them Yoga! I like how they even use the correct terminology when teaching the stuffed animals yoga! Great DVD for the price and not too babyish!  I read a ton of reviews and looked at them all before I purchased this DVD. I am very happy with my purchase!,1369267200,11,579,4.207207207207207
4900021,5,B005WZ6F4I,My 3 year old granddaughter and I practice our yoga with this DVD twice each week when she visits. She stays focused and entertained throughout. I have been doing yoga for several years but still have learned from the children. Music is great too.,1364083200,,247,4.636363636363637
4900022,4,B005WZ6F4I,The only thing I did not like about this video was the instructor's voice. Very monotone and depressed sounding. But great intro to yoga for the little ones.,1362614400,,157,4.642857142857143
4900023,4,B005WZ6F4I,"My daughter was experiencing stomach ""discomfort"".  After doctor's appointments and an MRI, it was determined that nothing was physically wrong with her.  After discussing this with her, I came to the conclusion that her ""discomfort"" was more stress/worry related than anything else.  I decided she should try yoga.  After reading the reviews, I decided this yoga CD would be the most appropriate for my 7 year old.  After 1 week of yoga, I never heard the words ""my belly hurts"" again.  She has been doing the yoga exercises twice a week for about 1 1/2 months.  She enjoys it and no longer seems stressed!",1362096000,,607,4.778846153846154
4900024,5,B005WZ6F4I,I bought this dvd for my 6 year old and she loves it! I also love the dvd. The routines are great and the song they play during relaxation is amazing! Everything about the dvd just really puts you in the right state of mind. I highly recommend this dvd!,1359072000,,253,4.08
4900025,5,B005WZ6F4I,"We love the simple and beautiful creative choices made in Omolulu's Yoga for Children video:  sweet set, great direction and narration, nice music (wanted to hear more). The segments are the perfect length and the little yoginis are very impressive. Congratulations on a well made video and thanks ... my search for the perfect yoga video for my 5-year-old daughter is over!",1357862400,,374,5.032258064516129
4900026,5,B005WZ6F4I,"My children and I absolutely adore this kid geared Yoga DVD. The routines are easy for them to follow, gentle instruction and soothing backdrop, no distraction. My 3 older children love to do the DVD together, perfect for my 9, 6 and 4 year old.

I especially appreciate how Omolulu aides in relaxing my children and causes them to be present and aware of their own bodies and minds. In this day and age,it is evermore important for children to learn the value of exercise and caring for ones own body; with all of the excess and overstimulation our children are exposed to on a day to day basis, this is lovely in its simplicity.

Keep up the good work Brynne Caleda!!",1339718400,6,669,4.475409836065574
4900027,5,B005WZ6F4I,"This DVD is an excellent resource for everyone-kids, parents, teachers, and yoga instructors.  I love its simplicity.  It was fun for children and instructive for parents.  Brynne does a great job balancing the postures with the reasons why these postures are so effective for children (and adults).  My cousin and her two children do the DVD every morning, and she says it helps her kids to focus and get through the day with little melt downs or behavioral issues. I love that the music, set design, and yogis were all local from Hawaii-it was a very special touch to a very special DVD. I can't wait for the next one!",1333152000,,620,4.609090909090909
4900028,5,B005WZ6F4I,"This DVD is wonderful!! My 3 year old daughter loves it, and wants to watch it all the time!! She can follow it easily, and it is so simple, easy to follow, and visually pleasing. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants an excellent yoga DVD for their children!!",1329004800,,276,4.326923076923077
4900029,5,B005WZ6F4I,"Doing yoga has changed my life, I fully recovery from a serious injury thanks to it. I'm so happy to have found this wonderful Yoga DVD for children. I can't wait to do it together with my two year old son.
Beautiful scenography and music that stimulate the kids (and adults) senses.",1328918400,,283,4.461538461538462
4900030,5,B005WZ6F4I,"I am a certified kid's yoga teacher within the Hawaiian public school system. I have extensively explored children's yoga DVD's and the Omolulu lessons stand out as exemplary. (my two year old niece loves the calming sequence... me too!) I recommend this product to anyone interested in incorporating yoga into their children's lives. And it's an excellent resource for teachers for ideas on how to lead a fun, enjoyable lesson.",1327449600,13,428,5.128571428571429
4900031,5,B005WZ6F4I,"Omolulu is a hit in our house.  My kids have been using the DVD mainly on the weekends.  My 8 year old daughter said that she ""likes to do it when she gets agitated by her 5 1/2 year old sisters"" as it calms her down!  They typically do two yoga classes in a row and love it.  They like the kids who demonstrate the yoga poses and the credits are also a hit for all of us.  It's clear that everyone involved was having a good time.  Well done.",1323129600,7,443,3.8666666666666667
4900032,5,B005WZ6F4I,"Our 4 year old son puts this on himself and does his favorites. Amazing to watch a child follow along, enjoying it, trying to mimic the poses, then spontaneously try some of them later on in the day. The pace and music are wonderful, and starting or ending the day with this is a favorite activity. We have a ""no-TV"" rule, but this DVD doesn't count...",1321833600,,352,4.348484848484849
8488197,5,B005WZ6F4I,"I am so in love with this DVD. We got this DVD, a mat and some other essentials for my 7 year old son last Christmas and he loves it! It's so calming, and educational. He asks me to practice with him and I love to. Such a cute video!",1468972800,,233,3.68
8488198,5,B005WZ6F4I,Great DVD for my 4 year old granddaughter. I read all the reviews and they were spot on as far as how good it is.,1467244800,,113,3.56
8488199,5,B005WZ6F4I,"Great DVD.  Son and I loved it (4yo).  Easy to follow, not too difficult to do.  Great to do before bedtime to relax and interact as a family.",1447027200,,142,4.0
8488200,5,B005WZ6F4I,I do this with my child every night before bed.. great mama kiddo bonding time! The video is adorable led by kids easy for my 4 year old to follow but hard enough to keep her interested!,1445644800,,186,4.054054054054054
8488201,1,B005WZ6F4I,The voice-over is not the best.  Hard to follow for my kids and goes too fast without helping kids to transition from pose to pose.  Resulted in my kids doing it once and not wanting to bother with it again.,1435449600,,207,4.15
8488202,3,B005WZ6F4I,"My kids liked it well enough.  They like it enough to ask for it. The lady who narrates the yoga session is a bit awkward though.  She is monotone and rather robotic. She seems to be disingenuous when.  Also, it would have been nice for the video to have been taped on Hawaii's actual beaches or mountains rather than a painted backdrop in a studio.

I like that there are different yoga session options (earth, mountain, water, etc...). I would recommend this video for young kids starting yoga if you can get passed the narrator's voice.",1433635200,,539,4.583333333333333
8488203,4,B005WZ6F4I,"My 3 1/2 year old granddaughter finds it easy to follow and does several segments at a time. It would work for older children new to yoga as well. The demonstration by kids in a very pleasant, calm way without cutesy distractions is excellent.  I do agree with other reviewers, however, the narrator's voice is so monotone it is laughable - at least to adults.  I love the song during shavasana.",1432944000,,395,4.549295774647887
8488204,5,B005WZ6F4I,"Before purchasing this DVD I did my research and this seemed to be the best option for what I was looking for. I wanted a video that would provide minimal distractions from animations, featured children demonstrating the yoga poses, and options for different yoga routines that were between 10-20 minutes. Based on the reviews and the product description on the company's website, I decided to go with this one. However, when I found this listing, Amazon said it was currently unavailable and did not know when or if it would be available again. I contacted Omolulu directly through their website to ask where I could purchase a copy. Within MINUTES Brynne Caleda (the instructor, producer, project director) directly responded to my email to inform me that more copies were being shipped to Amazon that week. Less than a week later I was able to place my order.

This DVD is exactly what I was looking for. There are 4 sequences to choose from, all of which include important breathing asanas to begin each sequence. There are also ""Pose Hale"" and ""Breathing Hale"" options to choose for children to learn individual activities. All of the poses are demonstrated by (highly skilled!) children and narrated by Ms. Caleda, who provides superb verbal instructions that are free of any jargon that may confuse a beginning student. The set designs are colorful, but not distracting, and the music included is relaxing and not over-bearing as I have experienced in other childrens' yoga programs.

Between the fantastic content of the DVD and the prompt customer service of the company, Omolulu has hit every mark. My kids and I are looking forward to whatever comes next from Omolulu. I would buy from this company over and over again.",1432598400,3,1730,4.921232876712328
8488205,5,B005WZ6F4I,"My twin 4 year old girls love this DVD. I admit the lady's monotone voice kind of makes me giggle whenever we turn this on, but you get used to it. And I believe it actually has a relaxing effect. I LOVE that kids are doing the yoga exercises in this video -- more engaging for my youngsters.",1429142400,,292,4.051724137931035
8488206,5,B005WZ6F4I,This DVD is just the perfect yoga for kids.  And I really enjoy doing it with my 6 year old daughter.  It is all of the things I was hoping for to introduce my daughter to yoga and she loves doing it- so the proof is in the pudding so to speak.  Thank you Omolulu!,1426204800,,264,3.7636363636363637
