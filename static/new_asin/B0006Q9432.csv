2191589,5,B0006Q9432,"When my son turned two he received Hard Hat Harry videos from a mother of three. She highly recommended this series to me despite adult criticisms regarding its low budget production. It simply captivates children ages 18 months to four years old.

Each episode is introduced by two children and the likeable Hard Hat Harry.  Their escapades are interspersed with a song or two plus footage from real farms (or construction sites or race tracks, etc.). The songs are catchy and likable (We enjoyed ""What does a cotton picker pick? ...a forklift lift? ...a hay bailer bail?""). Hard Hat Harry and the kids continue chatting as the real life footage rolls. They offer up explanations and information in a laid back, conversational manner.

I recommend this DVD not only for the entertainment value but because it empowered my son by helping him to understand the world around him. He was already interested in tractors, plows and combines but Hard Hat Harry helped him see how the whole process of planting, harvesting and processing grain culminates in an end product like bread.",1160524800,9,1077,4.939226519337017
2191590,1,B0006Q9432,"Good ideas and concepts for children to be exposed to and to learn from...but please, please, get the information right! Confusing a monkey with a chimpanzee shouldn't happen. Real Life Space Adventures needs editing but by someone who has already finished their schooling! Both videos were produced on a strict budget, by the looks of things, with an amateurish look as a result. Not worth any more than $2 in my opinion.",1137628800,4,422,4.875

For some reason he is not overly interested in the space adventure portion of the video which is a bit unusual as he is a big fan of space shuttle videos.",1271289600,2,316,3.953125
