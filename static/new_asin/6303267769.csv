7842163,5,6303267769,"...but my friend who wanted it is thrilled. Personally, it seemed like a very short tape for the price. But it appears if you are a ""fan"" it doesn't matter.",1370217600,,156,4.233333333333333
7842164,3,6303267769,This didn't go as in depth as I was would have liked. They fast forwarded their relationship too much. Volume 1 was much better.,1269216000,,128,4.375
7842165,2,6303267769,"While this is the continuation of the Luke and Laura story,  I was not as pleased with this tape as the first one.  I bought this tape just to relive faint memories of the Luke and Laura saga.  I should have just stopped with the first tape.  Watching the second one made me remember just how corny and silly the eighties were.  It made an interesting love story for television, and if you are a huge General Hospital fan, you may enjoy it much more than I did.  I enjoyed the first one better; it featured the courtship and wedding.",1201392000,,533,4.28
