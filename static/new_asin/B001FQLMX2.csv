8302365,2,B001FQLMX2,My daughter is four and is learning Japanese with me. This video covers a wealth of vocabulary which I like but I don't understand why they teach the -masu endings of verbs instead of the dictionary form. Also I wish that the on screen text was written in hiragana.,1472083200,,265,4.428571428571429
8302366,4,B001FQLMX2,I just wish it was not lesson 4. I needed lesson one. But we are learning a lot.,1465257600,,80,3.5
8302367,3,B001FQLMX2,"This video didn't capture the attention of my 2.5yo.  It's very repetitive with the phrases and vocabulary, which I found more helpful for myself.  We are an English speaking family trying to learn Japanese.  The other DVD we purchased Go! Go! Nihongo! is great and I would recommend that for a little on.  My toddler loves to watch that on repeat.  It has more songs that capture her attention.",1430179200,3,395,4.666666666666667
8302368,5,B001FQLMX2,My daughter loves watching this video.  It maintains her attention and she quickly started learning and repeating the Japanese words.  It is well put together and the Japanese pronunciations are accurate and authentic.,1377129600,,218,5.575757575757576
8302369,4,B001FQLMX2,I am a bit concerned that a few pronunciations may not be consistent with the way the words are commonly spoken bit this would only be an issue if the video is the only foreign language practiced in the house hold...but if you have learned the basics of the language you will find this a valuable tool when used with other learning method...think of it like flash cards and you will go far.,1361923200,,390,4.3561643835616435
8302370,4,B001FQLMX2,"My son seems to like the video and its helping my husband and I pick up some words too. Not sure why there needs to be an echo as each word us repeated, but otherwise the video provides good basic words.",1358640000,,203,3.975609756097561
