742265,5,6303954227,"I personally think this was one of Sly's best movies, even better than the Rocky series.
Stallone plays the part of a man named Robert Rath who has been an assassin for over fifteen years. His conscience is finally cathing up to him and he wants out of the business. Before he retires he decides to  do one last hit worth $20 million, enough money to live comfortably for the  rest of his life.
Banderas plays the part of Miguel Bain, a young, very  ambitious, ruthless assassin who is determined to be the world's best  contract killer. The only thing standing in his way is Stallone.
Moore  plays the part of the woman who Stallone was supposed to assassinate, but  instead developed strong feelings for.
The three of them combine to make  one of the best movie's of 1995 with plenty of action, drama, and a  semi-love story. I highly recommend it.",945820800,2,850,4.546052631578948

Watching Antonio Bandaras in this movie you can just tell he's enjoying what he does.  That's something about almost all his characters in any movie.  But this really works well.  It's sort of an extension of his gun slinging character in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/El-Mariachi/dp/B008JFSEBU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">El Mariachi</a>.  Then there's the real star, Stallone.  Ya gotta love watching Sly work.  In spite of what people think, he really IS professional.

Assassins is a cat and mouse, hide and seek, Seattle to Mexico hunt.  This is action, explosion, more action, shooting, a couple more explosions and sometimes witty snippets from one or the other shooter.  I like it.  5* good?  Sure.  It kept me entertained from start to finish.  Does that mean it's a fantastic film.  Only in the sense that it kept me entertained.  And that's why I watch movies.",1467158400,,1069,5.414634146341464

Stallone tries to kill Banderas but the man is too good for him and escapes. Then Banderas interferes with another hit.
Stallone is assigned to kill a woman but cannot do it. Banderas interferes still again and kills four men but Stallone saves the woman.
The woman has a disc that the person who hired Stallone wants. We watch trying to figure out what could be on the disc.

742780,3,6303954227,"Released in 1995, Richard Donner's ""Assassins"" is a slick action flick starring Sylvester Stallone as Rath, a professional hit man who wants out of the business after decades of killing. Antonio Banderas plays his young rival and Julianne Moore a computer whiz with whom Rath teams up. Anatoli Davydov is also on hand.

At a 132 minutes, ""Assassins"" is too long for what it is - a wall-to-wall action movie where someone gets shot every 1-2 minutes, at least during the numerous ultra-violent sequences. This would be alright if the story and characters were interesting enough to warrant such length, but they're not. Banderas shines in the role of Bain, the zealous murderous psycho, but being a ""murderous psycho"" means he will get no sympathy from the viewer, otherwise he wouldn't be a murderous psycho. The characters played by Stallone and Moore are more sympathetic, but there's not enough detail to really care about them. Beyond that, the plot is convoluted even while the film is snappy. Despite the thrills, the story's just not engrossing enough to give a higher grade, but it's nowhere near as bad in this regard as, say, ""The Mummy Returns."" In other words, ""Assassins"" moderately keeps your attention.

And then there's the pile-up of implausibilities that are too easy to spot, like how does Bain not get seriously wounded by a bus while hanging out the window of a taxi? How does he emerge virtually unscathed from a fall from a third-story window after a great explosion? Even if the table protected his head and mid-section, what about his fingers and legs that weren't protected? How did he NOT break something from the awkward fall? Why does Rath blow valuable seconds looking for a dumpster to throw a suitcase with a ticking bomb? If you knew a sniper was waiting for you outside a bank, wouldn't you use the back door and then maybe surprise the assassin from behind? If someone pulls a gun on you, like at the end with Bain and Rath, wouldn't you automatically shoot first and ask questions later? Lastly, the whole set-up at the end with one character waiting in the bank, another as a sniper in an abandoned hotel, and the other outside informing the one in the bank is the height of contrived.

I realize implausible and contrived things happen in all action flicks, but the really good ones are able to get away with it because the filmmakers take the extra time to work out the kinks and make a truly compelling picture, like ""Terminator 2,"" and not merely string together a bunch of ""exciting"" action scenes with contrivances galore. Still, ""Assassins"" is worth checking out if you like the cast and are in the mood for a polished action/thriller.

The film was shot in Seattle & Everett, Washington, Portland, Oregon, and San Juan, Puerto Rico.

742849,5,6303954227,"Assassins tells a story of a hitman named Robert Rath who is going to fulfill one last mission for the mysterious contractor before he retires. But complications ensue when his missions are being taken away from him by a younger, crazier, more ambitious competitor, Miguel Bain. Also,matters get worse when he falls in love with a beautiful and mysterious woman named Electra and when Bain is commissioned by the contractor to kill them both.

Despite the fact that the screenplay is somewhat implausible and silly,the actions scenes and sequences will definitely provide a lot of excitement and entertainment to action movie fans. It definitely becomes original and refreshing especially with the cat-and-mouse chase from Seattle to Mexico and the use of silencers in guns. Director Richard Donner also managed to give it style as he handles action sequences with adequate flair and has a good time blowing things up. This is definitely a guilty pleasure especially for viewers who love action thrillers.",1413590400,,1005,5.203703703703703

the directing is superb, the dialogue is engaging, and the pace is just right. even Julianne Moore, who i only remember from Jurassic park and Hannibal, seems to shine. the one thing I really didn't like, if anything, is how dumb she acted in some situations, and the conclusion of the movie resulting in a romantic union (banderas dies).

this is a movie that even stallone critics cant complain about.

743071,5,6303954227,"I already had a copy of Assassins and I wanted to get this VHS for a friend of mine. I first got Assassins because I had liked some of Antonio Banderas's movies, I was less familiar with Sylvester Stallone but I was trying to add to my Stallone collection and when I saw they were in a movie together I thought that would be cool. Some people may have a problem with playing a murderer who feels sad aboout killing people, because the question arises 'Well, if he feels sad about killing people and is heavy-hearted with guilt, then why does he continue killing people?' but I found Stallone's character completely believable. I liked it when he's on the computer writing to his boss and everything Stallone says out loud is the opposite of what he's writing in response to his boss's questions. I understood the idea of needing to get a stash of money before you break out on your own (I know how that feels) and though I've never killed a person, I know what it's like to be doing something because I *have* to, even if I'm against it. It's likely that the boss would have killed Stallone if Stallone ever outright refused an assignment or told the boss he wanted to quit. Though on the surface that's selfish, to kill people to protect yourself, the character did truly want to start a new life of helping people instead of killing them. When he starts protecting the woman he was suppossed to kill, you can see signs that he really is a good guy in spite of his past deeds. Even though in reality I wouldn't trust an assassin around me and I wouldn't relax around one, Stallone made me feel that I would trust his character as a friend if I ran into him. I found a lot of warmth in Stallone's performance. And the story about killing his own best friend and having to live with it for 15 years resonated with me because I had more than once been the cause of death for some animal friends of mine(not like deliberately shooting them, but just being responsible for their deaths) and the movie made me feel that the director Richard Donner would forgive me (if he knew me) for causing my own animals' deaths if he believed that I really did love them and that I really am sorry they died. The thing that made me love this movie is that it ends with Stallone and the woman both getting to leave their pasts behind and walk out the door to start a new life, with new names and everything--they really were gonna get to start over and not let their pasts control their lives. I saw the movie at a time when I myself was desperately needing to believe that. So Richard Donner became my hero for directing this movie. I'd never before been as grateful for any movie as I was for Assassins. And Antonio Banderas--the extraordinary comedy he gives this movie is the perfect component to balance out the heavy emotional story and I think this was probably the greatest performance Antonio Banderas ever gave in his entire career. The most hilarious movie villian I've ever seen. I'd rather watch Banderas in this than any of his ""good guy"" roles. I didn't know much about Brian Helgeland before I saw Assassins, and I don't know how much of the movie was written by Brian Helgeland since there was more than one writer, but I immediately thought that whoever wrote Assassins must be a genuis and I have since watched more of Brian Helgeland's work and I love it all. Helgeland seems to have a love and fascination for dark subjects (by dark I just mean, not wholesome movies)and this movie...I've never seen a better example of making a great movie out of a dark subject matter. I'm grateful to everyone who made Assassins. This is still my favorite Richard Donner movie.",1337817600,,3666,4.473134328358209

743114,3,6303954227,"I was interested to see the Wachowski brothers listed as writers for this film, which I would not have associated with their larger-than-life, over the top style.  This is a slow-boiler of a film.  Yes, there is enough action to go around, and plenty of ""silenced"" shootings, but the film *feels* slow nonetheless.  Stallone is as competent as he gets in movies of this type (his performance is nearly identical to his portrayal of a bomb expert in The Specialist, which was released the year before Assassins), moving stolidly through the movie at a measured clip.  Julianne Moore is interesting, if a bit under-utilized, though there is no real chemistry between the two (and none is required).  Antagonist Miguel Bain, overacted rabidly by Antonio Banderas, sweats and twitches and exclaims his way through his scenes as if his life depends on it, and while he's fun, one grows a little tired of watching him.  It's as if there's no ""off"" switch on Antonio this time out; one wonders if the actor himself got tired of the shaking, perspiring, gun-toting ""kid"" he was already a little too old to be playing.

The movie leaves many plot holes unaddressed -- holes that perhaps needn't be addressed simply because they exist from the movie's first moments.  Who is Robert Rath?  How did he get his training at the hands of his Russian mentor?  How did they meet?  How did Rath get hooked up with his contractor in the first place, as they communicate only through computers using the generic, plot-driven, impossibly fast operating systems available only in the universe of movies?  How is it that the trail of bullet-riddled bodies both Banderas' and Stallone's characters leave behind them are never a liability, even in passing? Why aren't both men the target of investigations by multiple law enforcement agencies?  And just how long can you sit in the balcony of a hotel room with a rifle pointing into a public square before somebody notices you and thinks perhaps that you're up to no good?

Overall, despite the flaws I've just underscored, this is an interesting and entertaining movie, if only because a shadowy world in which dangerous men make their livings quietly killing other dangerous men is compelling.  The tone for this is set immediately as the film opens, with Stallone marching a fellow assassin into a swamp to end his life for some unnamed (but presumably contracted) reason.  Watching it requires more than a little suspension of disbelief, and enjoying it may indeed be a guilty pleasure -- but it is a pleasure nonetheless.",1258934400,3,2551,4.8839907192575405

743193,4,6303954227,"I saw this years ago and loved it.  I love the banter between Banderas and Stallone.

He has ethics... if there is such a thing with assassins. But Stallone wants out. The past and the things he as done haunt him. But now he has a new problem.... Banderas keeps taking his contracts and then tries to kill him.

Now... its survival of the ""best"". Julianne Moore is a quirky ""mark"" who gets caught in the middle of an elaborate chess game.  Her and Stallone bond under unusual circumstances. He helps keep her alive, and they become partners in this adventure/thriller.

The technology is old... DOS computers, but you can see how it all fits... and I'm sure it was advanced for its time.

Rath wants to quit the sordid business, but he can't say no to the last big job, retrieving a computer disc and killing the mark, in this case an encrypter played by Julianne Moore.

Antonio Banderas is a young assassin who enjoys his work way too much, who idolizes and hates Rath.  For some reason, Banderas keeps turning up at Robert's contracts.  Also for some inexplicable reason, Rath chooses to protect the cat-loving computer genius instead of kill her.

743198,4,6303954227,"Assassins is a great action thriller starring Sylvester Stallone and Antonio Banderas.

Richard Donner, the director of the Lethal Weapon Films, has done a fantastic job as always, creating a world with characters that you won't forget that easy.

Sylvester Stallone does a good job as a hitman who doesn't wanna kill anymore, but still gets new offers he doesn't wanna refuse. While Stallone's character is on the job, a rivale pops up: Antonio Banderas. Now Banderas is perfectly cast as the triggerhappy killer who only wants one thing: being number 1 in the hitman world. For that he has to kill Stallone's character.

Not the most original story in the world, but that doesn't matter: it's pure entertainment and it gives a lot of thrilling moments and action sequences.

From the moment the two characters meet in some of the most beautiful locations and thrilling situations, the heat is on. Gunfire, explosions, sweat, thrilling conversations between the two: the heat will come out of your tv set! The atmosphere that is hanging around in this film is truely fantastic.

The action has been filmed in a fantastic and professional way and it will keep you on the edge of your seat. There are a few flaws here and there, and a few things that you musn't take to seriously, but because of the fantastic speed and feel of the film, it won't spiol the fun for even one moment!

This film is truely underrated by the media, so my suggestion is: ignore the media and watch this thriller, cause it will entertain you!

If you are a fan of Stallone, Banderas, Richard Donner's work, or just in the mood for some fun action entertainment, I would highly recommend this film!

Good popcorn entertainment with a lot of thrills and chills.

743199,5,6303954227,"If you have watched 'The Mechanic', you will certainly see a parallel between that movie & this movie. Both are fast-paced action movies about two assassins in conflict with each other.

'The Mechanic' starred Charles Bronson in the lead role of a veteran contract hit-man, Arthur Bishop. He took on a cocky but ambitious young man, Steve McKenna, played by Jan-Michael Vincent, to be his protege. The latter turned the table on the master.

In this movie, 'Assassins', Sylvester Stallone played the lead role of a veteran contract hit-man, Robert Bath, who apparently was number one in the business. A cocky, but ambitious young hit-man, Miguel Bain, played by Antonio Banderas, came into the scene with the fatalistic idea of becoming the number one.

Intertwined in their personal conflict of hierarchy, appeared a woman computer hacker, Electra, played by Julianne Moore, as well as a mysterious employer, Nikolai Taslinkov, who seemingly was connected to all the three key characters in the movie.

For the rest of the movie, it was an exciting cat & mouse game between Bath & Bain, with Electra eventually teaming up with Bath to elude from & deal with Bain.  The action sequences throughout the movie, especially the shoot-out inside a hotel in the first half & the shoot-out in an abandoned building (in Mexico) towards the end, were really good.

It was quite fun to watch Antonio Banderas playing the hot-headed, crazy guy. He was really good, as good as Sylvester Stallone, who, as typical & in most of his movies of this genre (Nighthawks, Cobra, Judge Dredd, Demolition Man...), played the cool, confident character...maybe, a little stiff in some way. Julianne Moore, a very accomplished British actress, unfortunately had an understated role, although she did her best.

On the whole, 'Assassins' has been an entertaining - never a dull moment - action movie to watch...especially when you can watch two assassins for the price of one!",1154476800,,1950,5.037267080745342

Stallone plays our anti-hero Robert Rath, a professional hitman who is at the top of his game but getting tired of the whole thing and wants out. Before he can make such a decision, his employer whom he doesn't see but recieves jobs from on the computer assigns him to retire one more mark, a computer hacker known as Electra, played by Moore. The problem that Rath is about to encounter is Miguel Bain, played remarkably by Banderas, another professional hitman who's out to get the same mark and kill Rath to become number one. The film turns into a cat and mouse game between Rath and Bain.

Director Donner succeeds in focusing less on the action, but more on the characters themselves and the interactions between them. There is no major body count nor is there the sound of gunshots or machine guns (all the guns in the film are silenced), and nor are there that many explosions, except for the scene where Bain gets blown out of a kitchen window.

Stallone is horrible as he is in most movies; I still find it amazing that even he believes that he can act.  But Bandaras is outstanding as the nemisis killer.  He oozes sociopathic behavior that seems incredibly real.  Great performance.

Not a great one though for Moore, but ok.  Her character is the dullest of the three, but is still an integral part of the plot.

The gunfights are incredible.  I think there are only something like three unsilenced shots fired in the whole film out of about three hundred.

Great fun for any hitman fan.  Granted the story is a bit unplasable, but the actions and weaponry as well as the tactics come off as seeming to be pretty realistic, at least what I would think would be realistic.

743285,3,6303954227,"This is a good action flick with a several big name stars, some who were not so big when it was filmed.

Sylvester Stallone does a good job as the ""retiring"" hit man, but his character is not much different from all of his previous movies.  Antonio Banderas has the same problem.

If you enjoy picking apart movies, there is tons of material in this DVD to throw stones at.  They use a wide variety of weapons and most of them do not actually perform as shown.  In one scene, Julianne Moore ""cocks"" a Ruger Mark II with her thumb.  This would be hard to do since it has an internal hammer.

There are also several spots where the director inserted ""subliminal"" advertising.  In two scenes, a bus is shown with a big red ""NO NRA"" sign on it.  In a bar scene in South America, a waitress is wearing a t-shirt with ""PRO CHOICE"" in large letters accross the front.

Overall it's a fun movie.  I had to hit the stop button and go over many scenes in slow motion to figure out what they were doing or what they were carrying.  I like movies that make me do that.  Good Saturday night popcorn flick.",1105833600,4,1092,4.242718446601942
743286,5,6303954227,"Antonio Banderas was just amazing in this film. He is either an extremely great actor or this is his real-life character! Superbly played. The character performance played by the other actors was good, but not good enough to compare to Antonio's great play.

I saw this film last night and due to my great admiration I had a dream that there was a shoot out at my home, and I was armed with this silenced 9mm, just like the one Antonio and Sylvester use in the movie! I remember I kept loading these clips (that they also used in the movie) and shooting, but dreams as they are, the clips sometimes wouldn't work properly, and I would fire, and it would get jammed. I remember hitting a guy, but I had to keep going back to my room to get another clip as I was running low on bullets! What is this, a film review or a dream review!! Ah, who cares! There are hundreds of boring reviews out there; here is something a little different!

Anyway, back to the film.

As I really grew close to Antonio's character, I really wanted him to succeed! Of course thanks to the way movies are made these days (and all-days!), the ""bad guy"" has to lose.

What do I like about Antonio's character, Miguel Bain?

His way of speaking and his voice is amazing to boost his character.

He is a young man, aged in his early to late twenties, unlike his opponent, aged somewhere in his late 30's to early 40's, he actually calls him ""kid"" a number of times!

He is hardly a child when it comes to his job (an assassinator), he is extremely professional, and I don't think I can over emphasize this point! The young man wants to be the No. 1 contract assassin, but to my view and I think to everyone else's who has seen the movie, he is already No. 1. He is a more advanced young assassin than his opponent. The other assassin played by Sylvester Stallone never intimidated Miguel Bain. He always had his utmost confidence, and played the game to his best. He even admits he chose the wrong hero! I think they both knew that Bain was really No. 1. Miguel wanted to make sure his opponent and his new mark is terminated, so he could instantly claim to No. 1, even though his mark was planning on retiring anyway! Nonetheless, he wants him dead.

It's the two top assassin versus assassin, though Sylvester's character doesn't really want to kill him, Antonio's character gives him no choice.

Of course there is a lot more to this great store, but that's enough from me, see the film for yourself, or if you have already seen the movie, then why the hell are you reading these reviews! :)",1091836800,2,2565,4.371848739495798

743360,3,6303954227,"When in a movie, the bad guy kills innocent people for no reason and feels no remorse, I'm hooked because I hate him. I really hated Banderas's Bain in this movie, which increased my enjoyment. Stelones Rath was cool too, and the two's interaction in the well done action scenes makes this DVD worth at least renting. Elektra is cool too in that you woudl want to be friends with her in real life. That said, this movie has some inexusable weaknesses to it.  Donner has tried to attach some significance to two symbols: Chess and the ""15 years"" thing about Rath killing his partner 15 years ago. These two symbols go absolutly nowhere, and everytime one character mentioned them, i had to laugh out loud. They didn't make sense. Also, why is Rath retiring? who cares that he is? I don't feel that his retiring has anything to do with the movie, altough it could have been done very well. The ending sucked too, when the Russian guy is still alive. i woudl really like somebody to explain that to me.  So in conclussion, this movie is worth seeing for the action sequences, and can probably be made into a drinking game: Everytime one of the character says ""15 years, you take a drink. Oh yeah, as somebody said before, i wish that Hollywood would teach its actors to fire a gun!",998265600,,1278,4.48068669527897
743361,1,6303954227,"Poor picture quality, every other second the picture either goes blurry or seems to glitch and show lines. Quite obvious on a computer monitor, less so on a tv. Annoying. Decent flick, though not half as dark as it tries to be, and burdened with typical Hollywood elements that detract from an otherwise viable main story. It does have its moments, primarily thanks to Banderas (IMHO), but is still doomed to cliche and mediocrity for its ""action movie"" formula. End result: where this movie could have been much darker, it is merely campy (like a typical action movie). Could have very easily become the thriller it should have been, if it had been given a director with some vision. It's clear that Donner really didn't know where he wanted to go (except to the bank) with this movie. LONG STORY SHORT: decent flick, bad dvd.",993600000,5,827,4.710344827586207

743365,3,6303954227,"On paper this probably looked like a sure-fire hit--and in the hands of another director, it probably would have been.  It had a few things going for it--namely the Stallone name, Donner's name (banking on his Lethal Weapon fame), and Banderas, who had been working fairly steadily during this time, and proved his mettle as an action star in the enjoyable ""Desperado.""
The idea of two assassins as chess opponents is a very smooth idea, but it's mishandled by all here with the exception of Julianne Moore as the cyber thief.  Stallone (as usual) simply walks through his role, and Banderas is wayyy too over-the-top, even for a bad guy.  To make matters worse, it's about 25 minutes too long; by the end you really don't care what happens to anybody.  Donner isn't the director for thought-provoking, intrigue-based films.  Give him an $80 million dollar budget to blow things up, and he's okay.  This film's supposed to be about panache and subtleties, but ends up being a by-the-numbers actioner with little action to recommend it.
Some decent action sequences, but I agree with one of the previous reviewers--'The Mechanic' was a much better film that handled a similar subject, and it didn't have huge box-office names going for it.",979862400,3,1238,4.899521531100478

In  fact, he was pretty meek in his later work, ""Cop Land"". Not many  actors are able to resurrect themselves the way he did.
Overall, his work  in ""Assassins"" was top-notch, as was Banderas'. As a young actor,  Banderas, I think, is off to a great start, and Stallone pretty much  extended his career opportunities indefinitely.

7857341,5,6303954227,"In my honest opinion it's impossible to rate this film without comparing it with a film that was released just one year prior to this one. It was called The Specialist. Assassins is superior to The Specialist in so many ways. Robert Rath--like his namesake, Ray Quick in The Specialist--is a hitman. Both have attract felines and beautiful females (Whom They Have A Soft Spot For) and both seek to minimize collateral damage.

The reason Assassins is so much better than The Specialist is because of Richard Donner. Simply put, this man knows how to direct an action film. His success with Lethal Weapon franchise proved this. Luis Lllosa was second best with The Specialist. Despite this, that movie did have its moments (See My Review Of The Specialist For Details). Assassins was a fast-paced frenetic film that had us wondering which killer would prevail over the other.

The beginning of the movie has us watch as Robert Rath is sent to slay a colleague in the killing business. ""We both play this game, Rath. What kind of shoes will you be wearing when your day comes?"" The hapless dupe who is to be slain by Rath says in fear. This is poignant because it foreshadows the movie's end.

Rath is a high stakes hitman that is contacted via email and who receives intelligence on his marks through digital photographs (A Rarity In Those Days). When Rath's mark is taken by an upstart he seeks out this interloper and in the process is caught up in a cat and mouse game where he finds himself in the middle of a tug of war between his handler (At This Point Unseen In The Film) and his rival, Miguel Bain (Played Wonderfully By Antonio Banderas). Assisted by the plucky Electra, an intelligent woman who is considered to be a ""ghost"", Rath is able to overcome great odds (He Barely Escapes Death From A Bomb Left For Him By His Contact) and together the two of them make it to Puerto Rico where they are able to confront both Rath's handler contact and rival, defeating both conterminously and absconding with a total of 16 million dollars.

My quibbles for this film are small but still worth bringing up. 1 million dollars would weigh 22.05 pounds according to an internet search I just made. Ergo 16 million dollars would be 352 pounds! In the movie we see Stallone (As Rath) sprinting across the street and into an abandoned building as if the bag he's carrying weighs only 3.5 pounds instead! Unrealistic. Then there is the Jasmine scent. One would think that the perfume would have worn off by the time Electra reached the island nation (Puerto Rican Stand In). Also, would she really take her cat with her when she went on high stakes jobs?

Despite the above quibbles I rate this movie Five Stars. I know you will like it and that's why I recommend it. I'm the 164th person to review this film and as J. Barcus said in 2015: If you like action-drama and suspense, this movie has a great combination of them all. Buy it, watch it and enjoy it. If you have any good taste in movies as time goes by you'll want to see it again. He was right, because I saw it last week and it's my third time seeing it since February 2008. I truly wish they had made a sequel to this film. It would have worked with another decent script.
