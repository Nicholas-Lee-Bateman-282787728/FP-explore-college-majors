Although the joy of the Lord is her strength, we thank CPR for adding a burst of laughter along life's journey.  CPR's routines are impromptu comedy interactions with their audience.  I'm glad to see the CPR crew using their talents for the Lord.",1426809600,,403,4.555555555555555
8151496,5,B000JK8PRQ,"Cannot be recommended enough, to all! Clean, pure & infinitely hilarious! These guys take funny, creativity & randomness beyond the next level! There is no one like them anywhere! Watching these guys is like an ab workout, you just might have ripped abs by the time you're done! When these guys are on, it's like someone's pumping laughing gas into the room. No, but I wouldn't recommend CPR unless you have a sense of humor & only if you want to laugh.",1177977600,,453,4.536585365853658
