7946550,4,B00005NB8F,This was one of the many series that seems to never have been completed. The storyline is good and the animation is also. Comedy in modern day with magic. A shame this one was never continued.,1275782400,,192,4.361111111111111
7946551,5,B00005NB8F,"Why was this the only DVD made?? It's soo cute, but definitly not for little kids. Surpassed my expectations. REALLY disappointed when it ends with no conclusion and really mad when you find out no more episodes were made! Still enjoyable enough to buy, definitly worth it.",1054339200,,273,4.829787234042553
7946552,4,B00005NB8F,"This is a very funny series.....i only wished they had finished it. check out my manga reviews on mangabits.com
if you watch anime....you should check out the roots by reading manga",1043712000,,181,4.870967741935484
7946553,4,B00005NB8F,"I saw this at the Comicon & picked it up recently. It's nothing groundbreaking, probably fairly standard for the day(copyright  1996). Boss is cute enough in his human form & the Japanese voice is Kappei Yamaguchi(Ranma, Inu-Yasha, Little Zenki) & he's the standard male character who chases/grabs/drools over anything in a skirt (actually, he's not as bad as Dragonball's Master Roshi--Boss actually thinks about his mission more than females & has to keep telling Lime they're suppose to blend in with humans. He's not as evil in his lechery as the Vice Principal in GTO either. Boss's demon form is similar to Hiei's from YuYu Hakusho) Lime fulfills her slot as jiggle standard to anime & does her obligated share of slapping Boss around/sending him flying. It's the quest theme we've seen in Dragonball/Inu-Yasha/Zenki/etc--jewels from the demon world are accidentally lost into the human realm so Boss & Lime have to retrieve them before they can run amok. I own about 300 anime dvds(ok, about 100 are Dragonball/DBZ), so I'm not neccessarily the pickiest viewer, but this one made me laugh, something 8 CRAZY NIGHTS did not. With only 3 eps, it's a rather short quest(but it doesn't really ""end""-whether more was done & not brought over or planned & never completed, I haven't found out), but it's fun. The purse is probably the cutest infected item. The hypodermic ep I saw at the Con is probably the least funny of the bunch & we get the girl-who-looks-like-a-guy like Mari from Project A-ko in BEM's Head Nurse. Want wow-get Hellsing. Want some pretense of a plot, get Dai-Guard or Martian Successor Nadesico. Want to laugh among the drama, get Soul Hunter(the show with a body count--worse than red shirts on Star Trek. Only just as one figures this or that bad guy is worthless scum, the show gives background to show why the character isn't all bad) Want to laugh so hard you'll have to watch it twice, get Excel Saga. This one is nice, fun fluff & worth it if that's what you're looking for.",1043539200,,2004,4.791907514450867
7946554,2,B00005NB8F,"Lime (as I'll call it) is not even interesting enough to be a horrible show.  Rather, it's bland, short, unfinished, and insipid.  The story goes absolutely nowhere.  Essentially, Lime and her companion, Boss, have to recover magical gems which were stolen and fell into the human world.  Both Lime and Boss are more or less idiots, and the magical gems, which absorb human emotions and become monsters, are no better.  The humor, such as it is, revolves around Boss trying to grope Lime and suffering for it.  The monsters (think small everyday objects with arms and feet) are probably supposed to be funny, but they aren't.  They are jarringly dumb, and the appearance of the first monster ended any hope that this might be even a mediocre title.
Nothing in this show ever clicks.  The character designs are reasonably nice (if too thin), but the animation is poor and the characters go off-model (i.e., don't look like they're supposed to) with some regularity.  The background music is so non-descript that I can't remember hearing any.  The show itself is like that: so forgettable that you're much better off forgetting any idea of buying it.",1011916800,,1148,4.871134020618556
