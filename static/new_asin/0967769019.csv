8135956,1,0967769019,"I bought this video to show to my accounting class but after viewing it, I  decided that my students would not sit through it.  It is just a guy  standing in front of a board talking about accounting.  Occasionally he  writes something. I think I remember some basic graphics in the form of  statements but nothing really memorable or instructional here.  He takes a  subject that is already boring and makes it more boring.  He knows his  content, but the format is just too hard to take.  I also bought the  Standard Deviants Accounting videos and find them a much better choice for  my students.  The students  find them helpful and entertaining in a  ""Saturday Night Live"" sort of way.",968284800,23,689,4.616666666666666
