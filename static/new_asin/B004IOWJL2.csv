8431055,5,B004IOWJL2,"Although this is a region 4 only disc, all that is needed is a laptop and Power DVD or the like to attach by hdmi to your tv.  It plays great.
Excellent stories, I've been waiting to get this until I found out that my PS4 plays burned pal discs, and thought maybe the region 4 would play, but was not compatible with the PS4.  I will not need any kind of PAL dvd player since my laptop looks to play all region.  This opens the door for many other programs I didn't think I could get.",1450396800,,484,3.9690721649484537
8431056,5,B004IOWJL2,"This is a classic-thriller series, that's to say, you'll see neither visual effects nor mayhem to terrorize you, but eerie stories to make you feel uneasy: fake funerals, inheritances that people will never take possession of, greedy insurance fraudsters who look like  next-door persons etc -- all th stories with creepy endings. If you like ""Ghost Story aka Circle of Fear"" and ""The Night Gallery"", this series is for you. The DVD format (area 4) may be a disadvantage for North American audiences.",1437523200,,500,5.024096385542169
8431057,5,B004IOWJL2,"The five stars is for the series, not the product since there is no Region 1 DVD set issued at present. This in itself is rather surprising, considering ""Darkroom"" was an American made-for-TV anthology series. It features James Coburn as the host who provides the intro and concluding comments. The format of this production was an hour-long episode that featured 2 stories of varying length. Each story had its own storyline and cast. Some of the cast members included actors and actresses that went on to make a mark in either TV or films, such as Claude Akins, Helen Hunt, Rue McClanahan, etc. Fortunately, I can revisit this show on Youtube where the episodes can be found, although the quality is far from great considering how old this show is (1981/1982).

Here is a list of the episodes:
""Closed Circuit/Stay Tuned, We'll Be Right Back""
""The Bogeyman Will Get You/Uncle George""
""Needlepoint/Siege of 31 August""
""A Quiet Funeral/Make Up""
""The Partnership/Daisies/Catnip""
""Lost in Translation/Guillotine""
""Exit Line/Who's There?/The Rarest of Wines""",1420070400,3,1055,5.205882352941177
8431058,4,B004IOWJL2,"Great anthology series from the 1980's. Some future stars are here in their younger days. Some of the outcomes in the episodes are obvious but the suspense is top notch. Acting and directing are quite good. Major flaw however is the overall sound quality. The original series was in mono and the company that released this did virtually nothing to improve the sound quality. If this is ever released stateside I will probably but it again and here's hoping the sound gets reworked. Beware also that this is an Australian release and it is a different region than ours, you will need a region free DVD player.",1400371200,4,608,4.691588785046729
8431059,5,B004IOWJL2,Excellent series not avilable here in the states. Just set your philips or other multi region to region 0 and enjoy,1395446400,2,115,4.523809523809524
8431060,4,B004IOWJL2,Remember this was shown in the UK late at night in the mid 80's. Great anthology show with a nice selection of guest stars. I wouldnt expect to find this on Region 2 but come on why no region 1? Too many great shows from that period still not available which is a shame.,1393718400,4,270,4.018518518518518
8431061,5,B004IOWJL2,"EXCELLENT ANTHOLOGY SHOW WITH HOST JAMES COBURN. RAN ON ABC LATE '81 TO EARLY '82, 16 ONE HOUR EPISODES. THIS NEEDS TO BE RELEASED LEGIT ON US DVD FORMAT!",1354233600,10,154,4.344827586206897
8431062,1,B004IOWJL2,"Not sure who the production company is for this, but let's get with it and release this in the USA in region 1. C'MON!!  does anyone know anything about this?? I own just about every sf/fantasy show outside of Tales from the Crypt so i'd love to add Darkroom to my collection. MAKE IT SO!",1345593600,7,288,4.236363636363636
