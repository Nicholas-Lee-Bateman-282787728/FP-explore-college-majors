2932717,5,B000V73BBM,"I'm very happy with this DVD set. It presents a wide range of science subjects, is true to God's Word, and it makes me want to pursue other DVDs about science. Excellent, highly recommended!",1369267200,2,190,4.617647058823529
2932718,5,B000V73BBM,I love these videos.  They have been around for years but are never outdated.  My kids watched them when they were young.  I've gotten them for my grandchild and now my great nephews.  They love them and watch them over and over.  Great Christian educational dvd's!,1358467200,3,265,4.673913043478261
2932719,4,B000V73BBM,"This product is really old school. The filming, talking, and scenery is not the fast paced stuff we see today in documentaries and movies.  That doesn't mean its not worth watching though.  My 3 kids loves these videos. They get a little bored with the narrator, but they love seeing the bees, ocean, and microscopic findings. To them, this is new and amazing. They could care less when it was filmed.

We watch these for school or for family movie nights. They are great. I love how the videos all point back to our marvelous creator. This set is a keepsake and a great tool for science.",1356566400,11,588,4.4766355140186915
2932720,5,B000V73BBM,"Even though these films were made many years ago, the information is still relevant.  It is wonderful how science and history and woven together with Bible truths.",1344038400,5,163,5.037037037037037
2932721,5,B000V73BBM,My wife and I absolutely love these videos because they bring scientific evidence for the existence of a designer.  It is a shame that in this day and age the establishment does not want to admit to these scientific truths.  We will be educating our children and all of our friends with these videos to equip them with scientific facts.  Some day these videos may even become illegal.,1332633600,6,384,4.617647058823529
2932722,5,B000V73BBM,In shopping for this set for my family I was shocked to see how much some people are trying to sell this for.  I've seen the entire set for $100 elsewhere.,1266883200,6,155,4.0
2932723,5,B000V73BBM,"My children love these videos.  Although my children are just 7 and 9 years old, they learn something everytime they watch any of them.  These videos have a great way of presenting the amazing wonders of nature and God's handywork all around us.  I am very glad I purchased the entire set!!!",1265241600,4,291,4.5576923076923075
2932724,5,B000V73BBM,These videos are fantastic.  They will wow young and old alike!  They hold our whole family's fascination from beginning to end.,1263513600,9,128,5.0476190476190474
2932725,4,B000V73BBM,"The Moody Science Classics DVD set consists of 19 short presentations (about 30 minutes each) linking creation, science, and the Bible.  One may critique the lack of eye catching modern visuals.  It has a very 60's feel which some of us actually will like.  What is important though is that there are numerous thought provoking moments that cannot be supplanted because of modern day superior technology.  Visual ""wow's"" are great but this is mental food which an individual can chew on and help to obtain a personal world view that helps to integrate the world of science within  the framework of the Bible.  By the way, there is plenty of experimentation that Dr Moon does while he is speaking.  This ensures that the viewers interest is maintained throughout the presentation.  Whether you are a Christian or not I think these videos help one to appreciate the wonders of creation.",1210118400,23,884,4.885906040268456
2932726,5,B000V73BBM,"When I was a girl in California, in the 1960's, a community center showed one of these films every week.  It was a family treat for all of us to go see these informative videos. I was a kid, but they were certainly not boring!  I couldn't wait to see the next one! Even though there were filmed decades ago, and scientific knowledge has grown, the undeniable truths they detail are still amazing and make your jaw fall in awe at the mind of the One who not only intelligently designed all that exsists, but maintains His plan without flaw.  In living things and creatures, they reproduce ""after their kind"", as He proclaimed at the time of creation.  Genesis 1:24 &25

  Even though the video quality is not what we demand of today's productions, they will still amaze and astound all who watch them!  If you believe the evolutionary theory, whether you've studied it and think you know for certain that it is fact, or just because that's what you were told to believe in school, I challenge you to watch these and say, ""God, if you are real, prove it to me."" For the Bible says that creation IS proof that we have an almighty Creator.
  ""For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even His eternal power and Godhead, so that they are without excuse."" Romans 1:20 (NKJV)
This full set looks great if you can afford it, but if you only buy one DVD or VHS you will still be fascinated!  Just type in ""Moody Science"" and there were be a selection of new and used titles.  My favorites are ""City of the Bees"" and ""God of Creation"".",1190764800,43,1609,4.4353741496598635
2932727,5,B000V73BBM,"Hours of pure, wholesome, Biblical, educational entertainment.  Why have your child sit idly by watching shows that have no eternal value and that will cause your child to act as foolish as the character on the screen?

2932739,5,B000V73BBM,"We love this DVD!
But shipping service was terrible, left the item in the middle of the parking lot in the raining without cover. It was soaking wet and could have ran over by a car to get out of the garage.",1402876800,,207,3.9523809523809526

2932743,5,B000V73BBM,"These video lessons demonstrate the beauty and wonder of creation and how the Maker put intelligent design into motion. While the films can be enjoyed by all ages, some topics are aimed at high school science levels. They are a useful companion through all school grades. Don't be put off by the presenter's 60s dress code, the truth is timeless.",1382918400,3,346,4.783333333333333

8217091,5,B000V73BBM,"Sound teaching that irrefutably shows Gods word to be scientifically accurate. Above and way beyond concepts taught in schools. Dr. Moon is relatable and funny, and my teenagers and I look foward to our times watching these DVDs. The discussions afterward are always enlightening... lots of a-ha! moments. Higly recommended!",1520640000,,324,5.5
8217092,4,B000V73BBM,"These are old school but still contain relevant truth about God and his Spiritual kingdom.  They are simple and straight forward, don't expect too much from a 20 minute show aimed at provoking younger audiences to think.  I like them and have found them useful in teaching my kids.",1519862400,,281,4.714285714285714
8217093,5,B000V73BBM,"We haven't yet finished all these DVDs but of the ones we've seen we have loved them. Packed full of information but presented easily to understand. I have 10 year old 5th graders and they've loved these. They are presented from a heavy Biblical viewpoint which my family loves. They were made in the 60s I believe (many years ago, nonetheless) so it is vintage looking. Very recommended!!",1506816000,,389,4.735294117647059
8217094,5,B000V73BBM,Excellent and relevant!  I wish I could give it more than 5 stars!!!!! This is real science from a biblical perspective..My children LOVE these videos as much as my husband and I do.,1504051200,2,182,4.515151515151516
8217095,5,B000V73BBM,"Excellent series.  Facts are timeless.  This series, while created decades ago, is still very relevant today and presented in a way that will both educate and captive children and adults.  My favorite part is that every episode honors Jesus Christ and scripture is tied in with every lesson.  Highly recommended.",1500508800,2,312,5.18
8217096,3,B000V73BBM,"I got these to use with my kids (ages 8, 6, and 4) for science as we homeschool; so far we've only watched the one about bees. I knew these recordings were old, and that doesn't bother me.  I knew God would be incorporated, which is great.  What I didn't expect was a 15 minute bee lesson followed by a 10 minute sermon that was clearly geared toward teens and adults.  Not exactly what I was hoping for, although they will probably still get used to some degree.  The science content was fine for my 8 and 6 year old (although quite dry), but not great for my 4 yr old who got a little upset during the close ups of some bees attacking and killing some intruder insects, which I might add, also had dramatic music playing in the background (it gave you the feeling reminiscent of hearing the Jaws music!).",1484092800,3,806,4.282894736842105
