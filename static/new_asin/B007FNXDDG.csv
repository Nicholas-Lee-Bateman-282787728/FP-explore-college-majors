Feedback from the players has been terrific and I love the variety I can now provide. Trust me players get tired and bored with the same old drills, use these DVD's to create and/or adjust your practice plan to fit your team. The Ultimate Game Changer is high quality video, many of the DVD's I have seen in the past are low quality and frankly annoying to watch, I also like the chapters section so I can adjust a practice plan quickly if needed.

5082653,5,B007FNXDDG,"Well, I was looking for something different and ""outside the box"" in my approach to coaching this year and I found it with this DVD set from Rijo Athletics. Not only do the drills keep the boys engaged in what we are doing at all times, it translates very well to my philosophy of not having to think, but react, on the field.
  I also appreciate the philosophy of all the trainers, and Jose in particular, of making this game fun. I will continue to use these drills and implement more throughout the season. I only see improvement in my players and a more organized practice and improvement in my coaching abilities.
  Thanks to everyone at Rijo Athletics for making a quality production with applicable, quality drills and information. Our team will be going to the facility to get an overall evaluation and I am very excited about that.
