8171722,4,B000MTEFPU,This will work quite well in my various aged classrooms. I enjoy having the books on a DVD to review as well.  Thank you.,1403395200,,121,4.041666666666667
8171723,5,B000MTEFPU,"I am very pleased with this great DVD especially since it has great stories for children, and teachers, like me, can use it in the classroom.  It was a great buy!",1356048000,,162,4.225806451612903
8171724,3,B000MTEFPU,"I disagree with the previous reviewer about this video having no interest or value - I enjoyed the two James Marshall presentations very much; they are certainly on par with other Scholastic Video releases, with good music, good animation and faithful representations of the original Grimm stories.  I also showed ""The Elves and the Shoemaker"" to a class of Kindergarten-age students yesterday, and they were entertained, and said that they all liked the story, even though the animation is only intermittent.  The final two stories on the DVD, ""The Three Billy Goats Gruff"" and ""The Fisherman and his Wife"" are both twenty-to-thirty years older, and have far less entertainment value, and seem a strange match with the other films here, being stylistically and artistically much more primitive.  So three good stories, two not-so-good; three out of five stars.",1198108800,3,861,5.22463768115942
