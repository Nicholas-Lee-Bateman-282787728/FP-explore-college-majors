If you can wait a while, you can avoid the exorbitant prices asked by third party vendors.

This is a great set of Scott westerns that need to be on Blu-ray. Until then, this set fills a need.",1440374400,6,281,4.490196078431373

8626389,5,B00GRGCKL8,"Mr. Lane, in another review, has given a good round up of what this fine TCM box set contains: two classic black & white Scott Westerns (THE WALKING HILLS and THE DOOLINS OF OKLAHOMA) and two color ones (CORONER CREEK and THE SEVENTH CAVALRY). All four were released and distributed by Columbia, which, arguably, produced the finest Scott oaters during the 1950s (including six of the later Boetticher series).  These four are all very much above the average Western of the period (late '40s until mid '50s). The quality is extremely good in every film. And as other reviewers indicate, there are extras, including copies of posters, lobby cards, and stills.

Of these four, the one that has always mesmerized me is THE WALKING HILLS. In many ways it partakes of the ""film noir"" current then the rage in Hollywood. The use of black and white filming, shadowing, and great camera work add to the mysterious, darker atmosphere of this classic film.  Director John Sturges and writer Alan LeMay created a true winner. Scott, Edgar Buchanan, Ella Raines, Arthur Kennedy, John Ireland, and William Bishop head an all-star cast (and I don't forget the uncredited Charlie Stevens); and the music of Josh White adds immeasurably, as well.

In short, THE WALKING HILLS is a real gem...not to in any way to slight the other three, which are all solid vehicles of classic Western entertainment.

Just a short postscript: most of Scott's Westerns have now been released commercially, but there are at least two from the late 1940s and 1950s they still need commercial release: GUNFIGHTERS (another Columbia product in good Cinecolor) and SUGARFOOT (a Warner release). GUNFIGHTERS is based on a Zane Grey story, and, while not as good as some of the ones here mentioned, it does deserve a nice release. SUGARFOOT is one of the better Warner/Scott vehicles, with some great humor mixed in (e.g., Arthur Hunnicutt and Hank Worden) and a deliciously nasty Raymond Massey.

Finally, the price of $68 is too much; this set can be had elsewhere from around $35; that's what I paid for mine.",1388188800,4,2071,4.886039886039886
