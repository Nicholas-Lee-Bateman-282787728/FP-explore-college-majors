1191836,5,B000006561,"Arguably Malle's greatest accomplishment although I haven't seen Lacombe, Lucien the film is ostensibly set in Atlantic City with a mileu that suggests Paris perhaps. The entire film is very rich and textured, distinctly European in it's flavor. Burt Lancaster gives another winning performance with another jewel added to his already impressive crown. Susan Sarandon equally good as a woman with dreams and aspirations who has just arrived in Atlantic City in constrast to Lancaster character who has become disillusioned with his own existence. A wonderful character study and examination of interrelatioships with people.",969408000,2,624,5.648936170212766
1191837,4,B000006561,"Starring Susan Sarandon and Burt Lancaster, this 1980 thoughtful film,
set in Atlantic City as it was going through its transformation, has a
lot going for it. The old hotels are being demolished.  And new
casinos are being built.  This contrast between the old and the new is
a basic and recurring theme.
Lancaster plays the role of a small
time numbers runner and is also a bodyguard-boyfriend to an aging
beauty queen.  As Atlantic City goes through its changes, he dreams of
the old days.
Susan Sarandon works in a clam bar but is taking
classes to become a dealer. Every night she rubs her skin with lemons
in order to get the fish smell off of her.  Bert Lancaster lives
across the court from her and watches this act from behind closed
blinds.
Lancaster was 67 when this film was made but looks older.
He's obviously had hair implants and some plastic surgery but when he
takes off his shirt, his body is firm with the kind of muscles that
come from working out in a gym.  And in spite of their ages, there's
good romantic chemistry between him and Sarandon.
The plot, which is
loosely about crime, is rather silly and if that's all there was to
this video I would have lost interest easily.  But the
characterizations and acting are so good that the plot almost doesn't
matter.
Although this is not a great film, I really enjoyed it.  It
kept my interest throughout and I cared about the characters.  It's
also a snapshot in time of an Atlantic City that has somehow
disappeared in the past twenty years.",967939200,3,1512,4.512820512820513
1191838,5,B000006561,"Haunting, elegiac film (written by John Guare and directed by Louis Malle) focusing on an aging numbers-runner (Burt Lancaster) and a young waitress training to be a blackjack dealer (Susan Sarandon) during the resurgence of  the New Jersey resort town. He takes care of an over-the-hill beauty queen,  she is saddled with a drug-dealing husband who ran off with her sister.  Beautiful depiction of all of the characters' dashed hopes, misbegotten  dreams, and plans for the future. Appropriately, film features Sarandon's  first great performance, and Lancaster's last.

1191839,5,B000006561,"""Yes, the Atlantic Ocean was really something in those days...""  -Lou Pascal
The above quote epitomizes the humour in Louis Malle's ""Atlantic City""...wry, subtle, and extremely dry. The comic  subtext in Malle's film may slip by viewers during their first screening,  because the picture operates on such a low-key level. The script's  pleasures are small-scale, yet incredibly rewarding.
""Atlantic  City"" is a character study about Lou Pascal (Burt Lancaster), a warm,  charming, elderly man who finds himself caught in the vast chasm between  the sad reality of his life as a nickel-and-dime numbers man, and his  projected self-mythology as a tough-as-nails gangster. John Guare's sharp,  witty script enables the audience to immediately fall in love with Pascal.  As the story progresses, fate throws a set of circumstances in Lou's path  that allow him to briefly live out his self-projection... we watch him make  a fortune from a small drug smuggle, don a slick white suit, obtain a  ""moll"" (Susan Sarandon), and surprise himself by gunning down two  violent thugs. Much of Malle's humour is anachronistic -- Lancaster trying  to act like Al Capone in Twentieth-century Atlantic City -- and ironic ---  the fact that this behavior runs contrary to the charming naivete of  Pascal's character.
Impressively, this film falls into a subgenre with  several others (including Woody Allen's ""Manhattan"") that  successfully juxtapose small, finely-crafted character studies against  commentaries about larger environments. As Lou struggles to preserve a  dying image, Malle cuts to shots of ancient hotels and high-rises being  demolished. This suggests that the legendary ""Old Atlantic City""  Lou constantly recalls, of ""rackets, guns, whoring"" and  gangsters, is itself crumbling, only to be replaced with casinos and  ugliness. Thus, the film operates on two levels.
""Atlantic  City"" is a brilliant, funny, heartfelt film with much to offer, that  demands a close viewing to be appreciated fully.",956448000,7,1999,5.447712418300654
1191840,5,B000006561,"Louis Malle's small scale pallate of the disintegration of Atlantic City is pure gold. As seen in Robert Altman's Nashville, Atlantic City gives you a broad feel for a particular area first, then lets you absorb the  characters.

1191852,5,B000006561,"Burt Lancaster started his storied career as an anti-hero in 40s Film Noir drama like ""The Killers,"" ""Criss-Cross,"" and ""Brute Force ""and an athletic action hero playing roles that would have gone to Errol Flynn a decade earlier. However, he was savvy enough to realize he couldn't be an action hero forever and wanted to grow as an actor.

He began to alternate his physically demanding, swashbuckling roles like ""His Majesty O'Keefe,"", ""The Flame and the Arrow,"" ""Ten Tall Men,"" and ""The Crimson Pirate,"" which relied on his training as a circus acrobat, with serious dramas opposite more veteran co-stars like Joan Fontaine in ""Kiss the Blood Off My Hands,"", Shirley Booth in ""Come Back, Little Sheba,"" Anna Magnani in ""The Rose Tattoo,"" and Katharine Hepburn in ""The Rainmaker."" All the leading ladies were Oscar winners.

Lancaster usually came off second best to these more experienced performers, but he was learning the craft of screen acting from these seasoned players and expanding his dramatic range while maintaining his original fan base. Ultimately Lancaster evolved into a superb screen actor with an Oscar for ""Elmer Gantry"" and nominations for his two of his finest performances in ""Birdman of Alcatraz"" and ""Atlantic City."" He continued to keep his legion of action fans happy with his more boisterous roles like ""The Professionals"" and ""The Scalphunters."" I can't think of another actor with that kind of career arc.

I've been a diehard Lancaster fan since I saw ""From Here to Eternity,"" and. I'd rank ""Atlantic City"" with Burt's best work: ""The Sweet Smell of Success,"" ""The Leopard,"" ""Birdman of Alcatraz,"" and ""Seven Days in May."". Burt deserved a second Oscar for ""Atlantic City,"" but sentiment gave the award to  Henry Fonda for what everyone knew was his final film, ""On Golden Pond."" Burt, however, still had a few movies left in him, and I also recommend ""Rocket Gibralter"" and his cameo in ""Field of Dreams.""",1466467200,2,1938,5.02803738317757

1191911,4,B000006561,"Don't hesitate to get into that film. You will love it because they are all crooked and they all want only one thing, to fool and rob the others. Killing is not really their job, but they enjoy doing it when it is not by accident and they relish the sensations they get when it is by accident. They rob, they deal and not only cards, they kill and assassinate, they cheat and they lie, they show off and they pretend, in one words they are all freaks who are petty criminals of no real nature and ambition. They manage to kill one another for a few thousand dollars, mind you something like thirteen or maybe seventeen thousand. Peanuts, even in 1980 or some time before.

That was the time when Atlantic City was finding some new gambling dimension after the downfall, when Las Vegas was investing beyond its own city limits and on the east coast for a while, that is to say close to New York, Philadelphia and some other cities of that size. That could not be the big losers and the big betters and the big winners, but many regular small or average addicted gamblers are more profitable than a few erratic big ones.

And when we are speaking of small, we mean small. Some plain white powder cut down by half anyway for twice the price. That powder was stolen and the money that came with it was just as much stolen as the white powder itself, from the first thief, to the second thief, to third thief, and the stolen money goes around just as much as the stolen white powder on a never ending merry-go-round.

Among these small young amateurish criminals a couple of two older and by now wasted uncouth people are trying to get everything for themselves and yet they realize their age does not fit that kind of activity and life, and they just collect a few crumbs and they let the only surviving younger one get away with the loot.

The only really good interest of the film is the decadent dimension of it. The younger generation was in the process of taking over but the golden boys had not arrived yet, the yuppies as they were going to be called. But all the same, it reeks of decadence with an after taste of poverty, particularly mental poverty. That world took so much time and energy to get wiped away. That was the time when a completely new approach was necessary and the older actor known as Ronald Reagan was going to be elevated to the position of president and that will bring this and this will mean that.

1191912,5,B000006561,"This has always been one of my favorite films. You might classify it as a ""sleeper,"" except with 5 Academy Award nominations, it probably doesn't qualify. Three of those nods were for the acting of Susan Sarandon (in her first MAJOR film), Burt Lancaster (in the Swan Song of his career) and Kate Reid (simply fabulous as the widow of a small-time gangster, who was Al Capone in her eyes). This film is a delight from start to finish, and for me, has certainly stood the test of time. I can't tell you how many times I've watched it, and I never tired of it.

ATLANTIC CITY: Ever get the feeling they're tearing down your past? Lou Pasco (Lancaster) does. He lives in delusions not of grandeur, but of a grand past, glorying in his alleged glory days. Demolition and construction, in an unceasing cycle, is the theme of this special film; demolition and construction of landmarks and of lives, the literal merely mirroring the inner rhythms of the restless characters.

Lancaster's Lou is dapper but trapped in the past; to him, Sally  (Sarandon) is ""a regular Princess Grace,"" attempting to deal her way into a Monte Carlo casino. Her hunger for wisdom and his chance for rejuvenation lead them into a May/December romance as tender and as curious as it is bittersweet.

The film starts out slowly, but picks up momentum exponentially, both in action and character development. And, in a final irony, everybody gets exactly what they wanted--whether they knew what they wanted or not. As Lou Pasco would say, they just don't make `em like this anymore.",1422489600,,1252,4.809302325581395

So where do the locals go? The normal ones are sitting in bars listening to juke box music or cafes, and if you go out the other side where the ghetto starts, you won't walk 3 blocks before turning right around unless you are looking to cop drugs. A great story to watch with  your teenagers about how people can get stuck in a place they will never leave because they need only a few weeks of school to make $15 as a casino dealer which is enough to have money in your pocket but never enough to save anything to better your life.

With sharply etched characters, astute performances and an ease about it that lends itself to every frame, there is something remarkably easy about Atlantic City.

It just feels fresh and fun.

The film centers on Lou, a washed up numbers guy looking for his next break, or next buck, when he stumbles across Dave, a druggie who just walked away with a lot of cocaine and is looking for a way to sell it.  Lou offers him the way, but when Dave winds up taking a knife to the stomach, Lou is left with the money and the drugs and an optimistic outlook.  He then makes cozy with Daves estranged widow, who just so happens to live in his apartment building.  He throws money at her, thinking that he can woo her, only to wind up netting her wrath when she uncovers where he got that money.  Throw some scorned gangsters in the mix and you have a rather intricately laced yet engaging story.

The cast all do a great job of bringing this to life, but Lancaster and Sarandon really do anchor this film.  Sarandon is the clear standout, finding so many layers to Sally and giving her multiple arcs, which help further the film.  Lancaster brilliantly plays off his age and fills every square inch of the film with an unintentional humor that almost paints a sad light on Lous development.

With bright supporting players like Kate Reed, and an unexpected conclusion that leaves everything right where it needs to be, Atlantic City is a fun breath of fresh air that is just as engaging now as it was in 1981.",1381449600,,1662,4.581081081081081

I love Sarandon, although her movies have always been hit or miss with me..in this, she's too gullible and dense..not to mention, from now on I have to associate a rotted old can of tuna fish with her... Burt Lancaster is and was somewhat of a mystery to me..I always wanted to know more about him (in theory), but never actually wanted to waste the time to learn more about him.... He always seemed like a semi-star from the golden era of Hollywood.. This movie was neither a high point for either actor's career, but more a vehicle for Sarandon.

 As for the film, it seems very dated, it's horrible in it's pacing, it's very run down and overly subtle (like many films between 78-82)the story is not particularly exciting either.. One would think based on the cover, which is the same 1-sheet artwork that the film has used non-stop throughout the years, that this film was something flashy or exciting, like a Casino, with a bit of grit thrown in -this is not the case.. The DVD case is the most exciting thing about the film.  Atlantic City was tough to get through and very annoying at times.. Every character was either loud, stupid or sleazy, or all three..

Director Louis Malle's camera captures the colors of the city, with a visual style strongly reminiscent of the painter Edward Hopper.  The story rehearses the film's visual style - as the elderly would-be hood, Burt Lancaster is just wonderful, as he looks nostalgically back at an Atlantic City that probably did not exist, except in his own mind, and contemplates the destruction of his past life.  Susan Sarandon, as a trainee croupier coming to find fame and fortune, discovers to her cost that all that glisters is not gold.

The photography is wonderful and really caught the destruction of the old Atlantic City and the beginning of the new Atlantic City (not sure it is much of an improvement).

It might be fairer to call the picture a John Guare film, for Malle, best known in Ontario as the director of the unseen Pretty Baby, has entered entirely into his gifted playwright's episodic, jazzy view of the universe - Guare's script for Atlantic City is a commodious comic masterpiece, but it's also a serious fable about the dangers of dreaming.

Everyone in the picture, placed affectionately in an evocative Atlantic City devolving from tasteful faded glory to tasteless refurbished glitter, dreams of getting ahead. (Is Atlantic City a metaphor for the filmmakers' America? Probably.) For the renegade sixties couple Dave (the talented Canadian actor Robert Joy) and Chrissie (Hollis McLaren, the schizo of Outrageous]), the boardwalk is a substitute for the San Francisco of 1966, buried as completely as Atlantis. The pregnant Chrissie wants to take LSD ""so we can learn from the baby's wisdom"" and Dave, a coke dealer, wants to dump his stash and his past.

Sally (Susan Sarandon), who is both Chrissie's sister and Dave's estranged wife, shovels shrimp behind the counter of a casino oyster bar but meanwhile sees to her dream by attending dealers' school - ""I gotta develop my blackjack; I'm gonna deal my way to Europe"" - and, total woman that she is, works on improving her body with lemon juice and her soul with a cassette of Bellini's Norma. When she becomes romantically involved with Lou, she has one request: ""Teach me stuff."" Near Sally's tattered domicile (Sally would use that word, rather than the mundane ""apartment"") Lou waits gallantly on Grace (Kate Reid), a former beauty queen and mobster's moll reduced by time and Lou's lack of discipline to a state of kitschy caterwaul.

Grace, lying in a bed strewn with ribbons and poodles and other fussy things, bitches at and about Lou; if she were an inanimate object, she'd be a battered pink plastic lawn flamingo, but Lou, a romantic to the tips of his carefully ironed silk ties, cherishes the memory of what she was, while mildy grousing at the monstrous Baby Jane she is.

Lou's most notable characteristic is his tolerance: a man old enough to have ""run numbers for the dinosaurs,"" a man who can say wistfully, ""The Atlantic Ocean was something then"" - this is not a man apt to be angry long at infirmity, senility or even cruelty.

Lou's dapper, chivalrous, compassionate existence informs the sensibility of Atlantic City with something very much like love; the movie's unpredictably explosive, joke-like tone can be inferred from the fact that Lou's splendid reviviscence is made possible by murder. Atlantic City is a cautionary comedy about a place where dreams can come true. Too true. Conrad Alton, Filmbay Editor.",1216598400,,2949,5.0081632653061225

1192032,4,B000006561,"""Atlantic City"" follows some small time losers in a city that has seen better days. Atlantic City - as much a character in the film as the human actors - is being pulled down and rebuilt, the old days - represented by Lou (Burt Lancaster) and Gracie (Kate Reid) - are long gone.

Sally Matthews (Susan Sarandon) is the new face of Altantic City, an outsider with no sense of history and a hopeless dreamer. Joseph (Michel Piccoli) represents the sophistication of Europe - although it hard to understand anything he says with his thick French accent.

With its deliberate pace and air of detachment, Altantic City has the feel of a European film. Not as great as many reviewers would lead you to believe but this is still an excellent film.",1203465600,,740,4.598484848484849
1192033,5,B000006561,"Low-life Lou may like to boast that he ""keeps in trim"" with his lady friends and that he's still got solid connections in Vegas, but the plain fact is, it's mostly in his head. Unable to fulfill the grandiose life narrative that he has constructed for himself, and with the once-solid exterior of Atlantic City symbolically crumbling around him, Lou is relegated to literally ""answering the bell"" and catering to a gaudy, caterwauling shut-in for chump change.

Enter a young miss who uses lemons to freshen up within eyesight of Lou's hole-in-the-wall apartment, and everything changes. Growing ever-more dapper and self-assured, Lou decides to give life a second fling, with a stroke of good fortune (a dope dealer whose payoff falls in Lou's hands) helping things along.

Yet ""Atlantic City"" is no standard-fare romantic comedy; it seamlessly blends spitting ocean wind and decrepit neighborhoods with a  tenderhearted character study of a man looking over his shoulder and an equally fascinating portrait of a blue-collar lovely suffering from hard knocks and longing for someone to respect her. The results of Malle's melange are glorious, and two scenes are emotional standouts: when his and her eyes lock in absolute understanding and, shortly after, when the bliss that Lou has just experienced collapses violently and he is reduced, helpless, to watching the woman he seeks to protect fend off the assault of a two-bit thug. It's not often we can sympathize with someone who shields ill-gotten gain from the woman he's romancing, but the successful act of honor that Lou will ultimately perform offers him - and us - the emotional closure that we crave.

Mixing gangland hijinks, a May-December romance and some outrageous supporting characters may sound impossible to pull off, but Malle does it sublimely. This is no heavy-handed crime drama, but an Atlantic cousin's very insightful observation of an aging would-be lion coming to terms with himself in the midst of a dowdy resort for Americans on the make. With extraordinarily clever dialogue, great casting - includy a ""campy"" Robert Goulet crooning to Susan Sarandon in a phone booth as she calls Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan - ""Atlantic City"" will make you smile, laugh out loud... and think.

1192034,4,B000006561,"This is a little bit on the seedy side but it's well-done and Burt Lancaster, once again, provides us with a wonderful character study. This time he's ""Lou Pascal,"" an old-time small hood playing out his days in pathetic manner in a dingy Atlantic City. In fact, ""seedy"" describes Atlantic City in this picture.

There's nothing seedy about the opening scene, however. It's an attention- grabber, at least if you're a male. We see Susan Sarandon, squeezing lemon juice over her breasts at the kitchen window. Later, we see her do the same thing. The film is no lemon, however. It's an excellent film and Lancaster, Sarandon (""Sally Matthews"") and her husband ""Dave"" (Robert Joy) comprise most the early going. Joy's role as Sally's loser druggie husband was ugly but he doesn't last long in the film.

The second half of the film features mostly the two stars, both of whom were up for Academy Awards for their performance (and lost out in a sentimental vote for the On Golden Pond crowd). Not only do Lancaster and Sarandon excel, but so does director Louis Malle.

Malle makes this almost a modern-day film noir with the grittiness of the characters and the setting, when Atlantic City looked its worst. It's just solid film-making all-around, and few people could play intense characters, young or old, as well as Lancaster.

My only regret is the transfer on the DVD. It's a little grainy and this film deserves better treatment. although, come to think of it - the grain is appropriate considering it's a gritty story.",1189209600,,1523,4.801526717557252

Part romantic comedy, part thriller, part fairy-tale, the film is simultaneously mythic and rooted in reality and charms through its wry acknowledgment of human delusions and its tender portrait of passion and dignity regained...

1192038,5,B000006561,"""Atlantic City"" is one of Louis Malle's finest films.  It is an engaging picture from beginning to end, portraying the annihilation of America's past.  This is the result not only of Malle's vibrant direction, but also of a lively screenplay (by John Guare), a playful soundtrack (by Michel LeGrand), and polished performances by Susan Sarandon, Burt Lancaster and a cast of talented supporting players.

Sarandon plays an ambitious working girl who labors in a clam bar by day and studies to be a croupier at night.  It's her desire to graduate from the gambling parlors of Atlantic City to the more prestigious casinos of Monte Carlo.  Lancaster portrays an old man who shares an apartment in the same condemned building as Sarandon.  He is rooted in the romantic past, at a time when gambling provided illegal thrills and Atlantic City was devoid of its tawdry modern gloss.  The lives of these two people converge on the Boardwalk, where they share a tangle of bizarre adventures involving a variety of fascinating friends and strangers.

The unusual relationships which develop between the young and old characters mirror the atmospheric ambivalence of Atlantic City, where vintage architecture stands side by side with sterile steel modernity.  Malle emphasizes the contrast through the use of intriguing images.  Few films feature such a memorable sequence of opening scenes.  As the credits roll, viewers witness the destruction of a massive old building.  It crumbles in slow motion, to the accompaniment of a soundtrack punctuated by the beat of jackhammers and wrecking balls.  This shot fades to the sight of Sarandon slicing lemons at an open window.  While Lancaster peeps from an adjacent apartment, the object of his gaze bathes her upper body with lemon juice.  One ""juicy"" scene succeeds another in ""Atlantic City.""  The outrageous interplay of beauty and decay, the silly and the serious, contribute to an exotically humorous, intriguing plot.  Few films are as intelligent or entertaining.",1137801600,8,2009,5.1894409937888195
1192039,5,B000006561,"One of the great American films was actually produced by France!

Burt Lancaster plays aging bagman Lou.  He has a long distance voyeurism of Sally (Susan Sarandon) a waitress at the Casino seafood bar and wannabe blackjack dealer.  He also is the bodyguard of a faded beauty queen, Grace (Kate Reid).

What brings everyone together is a visit by Sally's brother and pregnant girlfriend.  He has ""found"" some cocaine and is looking to sell it in Atlantic City.  Lou sees an opportunity and grabs it.  When the crooks catch up they kill Sally's brother.  But Lou has the stash.  After a shootout with the crooks, Lou and Sally leave Atlantic City.

This takes place in the 1980's Atlantic City which was before all commercial casinos came to town.  Malle uses this city in the midst of change as a small microcosm of the flux that the United States was in.  Lou represents the old regime that is trying to hold on to the old ways.  Sally represents everyone trying to get ahead in the new America that is more interested in the bottom line than the people who make the money for them.

Both Lancaster and Sarandon deservedly received Oscar nominations but Kate Reid also gave a superlative performance.

This is a film to be savored like a fine wine, that only gets better with age.

He also falls in love with a younger woman (Susan Sarandon) and in protecting her he gets the chance of a lifetime (for him): he guns down two hoods. It's all over the TV and newspapers, and he thinks of himself as the real hotshot he never was. His moment finally came and he was able to seize it, and is redeemed (at least in his own eyes). Lancaster is at his very best here; he's got the class from the old days (he loses the girl, but that's part of the scenario anyway, to him), and when he starts to giggle after shooting the two thugs we know exactly how he feels.

1192051,5,B000006561,"For whatever reasons, this film never has received the recognition and appreciation I think it deserves. It was directed by Louis Malle and stars Burt Lancaster as Lou. (In Atlantic City, first names are all you need to know about those around you.) Malle carefully develops three different story lines: Lou's long-term affair with Grace (Kate Reid), a mobster's widow; Lou's relationship with Sally (Susan Sarandon) to whom he feels both a paternal and romantic attraction; and his symbiotic relationship with Atlantic City. Both he and the city  seem long past their prime. During the course of the film, Sally also becomes a widow. Credit Malle and his excellent cast as well as cinematographer Richard Ciupka for creating and then sustaining an atmosphere of deterioration and menace. Special note should also be made of John Guare's screenplay. He, Malle, Lancaster, Sarandon, and the film were all nominated for an Academy Award. (FYI, The respective winners in 1980 were Bo Goldman for Melvin and Howard, Robert Redford for Ordinary People, Robert De Niro for Raging Bull, Sissy Spacek for Coal Miner's Daughter, and Ordinary People.) Toward the end of his career, Lancaster accepted a series of roles (including this one) which enabled him to explore and reveal subtle nuances of character and personality which much earlier roles neither permitted nor required. My own opinion is that his performance as Lou is his greatest achievement as an actor.
However, in certain respects, Atlantic City itself really is the dominant character. I recall brief visits to it in the 1970s. The city then bore little resemblance to what it has since become, at least in the casino area. Of course the city then bore little resemblance, also, to the elegant seaside resort it once was 75 years earlier. My guess (only a guess) is that Malle's work in this film -- especially his establishment and enrichment of precisely appropriate tone and atmosphere -- had a significant influence on later films such as House of Games (1987), Miller's Crossing (1990), Billy Bathgate (1991), Road to Perdition (2002), and The Cooler (2003). As I said, just a guess.
One final point: I think it is a disgrace that the so-called  ""special features"" provided with the DVD version are limited to ""Theatrical trailer(s)"" and ""Widescreen anamorphic format.""",1078790400,36,2331,5.115485564304462

Louis Malle captures Atlantic City in its decline, telling a wonderful story of misplaced souls who struggle to find their place. Susan Sarandon turns in a memorable performance Sallie Matthews, who soon becomes Lou's love interest as she washes away the smell of brine from her shoulders in one of the signature scenes in the movie.
Malle constructs an elaborate story dealing with the gangsterism of Atlantic City past and present.  Lou finds himself the reluctant paramour of Grace, the widow of a former crime boss, who Lou worked for.  A relationship Malle never loses sight of as he develops the relationship between Lou and Sally, taking it to its fitting conclusion.
Malle has such a fine eye for detail, which made him one of the best directors in cinema.  He brings his French sense of realism to Hollywood, playing off American gangster films in the same way Truffaut did, but creating what I think are more captivating films. Atlantic City is a pearl.  It is so well rounded and lustrous that one can watch this movie over and over again and be enchanted each and every time.",1072051200,4,1282,4.705357142857143
1192053,4,B000006561,"As of late I have been watching the films of Louis Malle. I have watched some movies for the first time and others a second time around. What I've noticed about Malle is the way none of his films seem to have a distinctive feel to them. He seems able to direct every movie in a different style that is relatable to it's story. Each film carries it's own personal tone to it. Watch ""Au Revoir Les Enfants"", ""My Dinner With Andre"", ""Damage"" and this film. I don't notice any similarities in Malle's style of directing. And I guess that's a good thing.
 ""Atlantic City"" is a film about lost hopes and dreams. The movie's most interesting character I feel is Lou (Burt Lancaster). A small time hood who remembers Atlantic City in the ""old days"". He claims he at one time knew all the famous gangsters. Lou is at an age in his life where he feels regret. He thinks where is his big payoff? For the past 40 years he has been Grace's (Kate Reid) bodyguard\boyfriend. And now seeks something more. He want to be one of those people who feels ""important"". He wants money and beautiful women around him. He wants to live it up in his old age.
 The other main character is Sally (Susan Sarandon). A woman who is now on her own after he husband left her for her sister, who is now having a baby! Sally wants to become a dealer in a casino. She feels she has a lot to look forward to in the future. Things seem to be shaping up nicely for her and with enough time may get her life back on track.
 What I like so much about ""Atlantic City"" is how Malle seems truly interested in these characters. This is one of those movies where the strenght lies not within the plot, but the people. Its the characters who make the movie because we can see ourselves in them. At one time or another I bet we have all felt a bit like Lou. I'll freely admit I have at times. We have all felt down asking ourselves when will our luck turn around. When will we hit the jackpot? For Lou it will come sooner than he thinks. But, Malle doesn't rush the movie. He lets the movie flow at its own rhythm. He really cares for these people and is willing to take the time to tell their stories. And in the end ""Atlantic City"" is a touching story that most people should find enjoyable.
 At it's time of release ""Atlantic City"" was showered with awards and nominations. The movie went on to earn 5 Oscar nominations including ""Best Picture"". It won 7 Cesars awards, including ""Best Picture"" and it also won the Golden Lion award for ""Best Picture"". And Roger Ebert named it one of the ten best films of 1981!
 I don't know if it was in some way meant as a joke or if I personally just got a kick out of this but Wallace Shawn has a brief cameo in the movie as a waiter. In a movie Malle made that same year ""My Dinner With Andre"" Shawn had a role in that movie. That movie was set with two people in a restaurant having dinner. This time around, Shawn is now the waiter. I don't know why but I just thought I'd mention this.
 Bottom-line: One of the best films of it's year. Director Malle does a wonderful job of telling the story. The characters seem real enough where we give them our feelings. A strong touching movie.",1054944000,,3181,4.223684210526316

Burt lancaster is perfectly cast as an-old time and small time numbers runner who is hanging on the fringe of the old Atlantic City.

At one point he tells a younger drug dealing  hustler ""you should have seen the Atlantic Ocean back then, it was really something."" as he stares wistfully into the distance.
The comparisons between old and new are extended into the characters and their tastes in everything from clothes to music. The soundtrack alternates between 40's big band and modern jazz.
The decadence of  Atlantic City is captured very realistically. Robert Goulet singing a campy song to a roomful of hospital patients as a new wing donated by the casino is being dedicated, etc.
Susan Sarandon is very good as a young woman who sees her escape  route in obtaining a license to deal blackjack.
The scenes with her and Lancaster are extremely well done.

At the time Atlantic City was a fading beach resort that introduced legalized gambling in 1978 to save it from ruin.  Burt Lancaster stars as Lou Pasco, an old time numbers runner who business is slowly fading away in part to the casinos, which he refers to as too wholesome.  He is also the boyfriend/bodyguard for a former beauty queen from the 1940's who is now an invalid.  Susan Sarandon co-stars as Sallie Matthews, an employee at a clam bar located in a casino, who dreams of going to Monte Carlo.

Their paths cross and they come upon a package of cocaine that Sallie's estranged husband leaves behind.  Looking for a last big score, Lou sells the coke, but instead of going with Sallie, stays with the beauty queen.  Director Louis Malle perfectly captures the dark side of Atlantic City and Mr. Lancaster gives one of the best performances of his career and his last great one as lead actor while it is the first time Ms. Sarandon showed the skills that would make her one of the top actresses in the business.

1192056,5,B000006561,"Europeans have always delighted in introducing America to itself.  (I am thinking of de Tocqueville and Nabokov.)  There is something very valuable about seeing ourselves through the eyes of others.  In Atlantic City, assumptions about the American way of life, the American dream and the America reality, circa 1978, are examined through the artistry of master French film director, Louis Malle (Murmur of the Heart (1971), Pretty Baby (1978), Au Revoir Les Enfants (1987), etc.)

The film begins with a shot of Sallie Matthews (Susan Sarandon at 34) at the kitchen sink of her apartment squeezing lemons and rubbing them on her arms, her neck, her face as Lou Pasco (Burt Lancaster at 68) watches unbeknownst to her from across the way, the window of his apartment looking into hers.  She works at a clam bar in a casino on the boardwalk, which is why she smells like fish, which is why she is squeezing lemon on herself to get rid of the smell.  She is taking classes to be a blackjack dealer.  Her dream is to go to Monaco and deal blackjack in one of resort casinos and perhaps catch a glimpse of Princess Grace.  She listens to French tapes and achieves...an amusing accent.  He is a has-been who never was, a pathetic old numbers runner well past any dream of his prime, pretending to be a ""fancy man"" as he picks up a few extra bucks waiting on an invalid woman.

Enter a hippy couple with all their belongings on their backs.  It turns out that he is Sallie's estranged husband, a deceitful little guy who has found a bag of cocaine that he intends to cut and sell; and she is Sallie's not too bright sister, very pregnant.  They need a place to stay and have the gall to impose on her.

Both Burt Lancaster and Susan Sarandon were nominated for Academy Awards for their performances, as was director Louis Malle and writer John Guare for his script.  But none of them won.  This was the year of On Golden Pond with Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn taking the Oscars while Warren Beatty won Best Director for Reds.  (Best film was Chariots of Fire with Colin Welland winning the Oscar for his original screenplay.)  Nonetheless, Lancaster and Sarandon are outstanding, and they are both beautifully directed by Malle.  Lancaster in particular demonstrated that at age 68 he could still fill up the screen with his sometimes larger than life presence.  The familiar flamboyance and sheer physical energy that he displayed in so many films, e.g., Come Back, Little Sheba (1952), From Here to Eternity (1953), The Rose Tattoo (1955), Elmer Gantry (1960), to name four of my favorites, are here properly subdued.  He moves slowly and is easily winded.  He is a sad, cowardly old man whom Malle, to our delight, will miraculously transform.

Sarandon's performance is also one of her best, on a par with, or even better than her work in Thelma and Louise (1991) for which she was also nominated for Best Actress and also did not win.  She is an actress with ""legs"" (this is a pun and an allusion to an inside joke about her famous other attributes-nicely displayed in Pretty Baby--over which perhaps too much fuss has already been made!)--an actress with ""legs,"" as in a fine wine that will only get better with age.  She, like Goldie Hawn, Catherine Deneuve and a few others, have the gift of looking as good (or better) at fifty as they did at thirty.

Louis Malle films are characterized by a tolerance of human differences, a deep psychological understanding, a gentle touch and an overriding sense of humanity.  Atlantic City is no exception.  What Malle is aiming at here is redemption.  He wants to show how this pathetic old man finds self-respect (in an ironic way) and how the clam bar waitress might be liberated.  But he also wants to say something about America, and he uses Atlantic City, New Jersey--the ""lungs of Philadelphia,"" the mafia's playground, the New Yorker's escape, a slum by the sea ""saved"" (actually further exploited) by the influx of legalized gambling in the seventies--as his symbol.  He begins with decadence and ends with renewal and triumph, and as usual, somewhere along the way, achieves something akin to the quality of myth.  Even though he emphasizes the tawdry and the commonplace: the untalented trio singing off key, the slums semi-circling the casinos where Lou sells numbers, the boarded-up buildings, the sad, tiny apartments about to be torn down, Robert Goulet as a cheap Vegas-style lounge act, etc., in the end we feel that it's not so bad after all.

I should also mention Kate Reid who played Grace, the invalid, ex-beauty queen widow of a mobster, who orders Lou about.  She does a great job.  Her character too will be transformed.

If the late, great Louis Malle was running the world the gross transgressors would surely get theirs and the rest of us would find forgiveness for our sins, and renewal.

1192057,5,B000006561,"'Atlantic City' is probably the best little film no one has seen.  That's too bad, because it deserves to be remembered more than it has been during the past 20 years.
Susan Sarandon is outstanding in her portrayal of a young woman wanting to start her life over as a dealer in an Atlantic City casino.  She starts out at the bottom, serving at an oyster bar, but she has hopes and dreams.  (Who doesn't have in Atlantic City?)
Things could be worse and suddenly are when her ex-husband shows up with her sister, whom he's gotten pregnant.  (Something you don't expect to see everyday...)  What do they want?  A place to stay for awhile would be nice...  But the husband is really in Atlantic City to make a big drug deal.  He has no connections to the Atlantic City drug bosses, so Sarandon's next door neighbor Lou (in a wonderful performance by Burt Lancaster) befriends him.  The ex-husband's lack of contacts in Atlantic City and lack of knowledge of the city itself land him and everyone around him in big, big trouble.
The main theme running throughout 'Atlantic City' is change.  The city was once very different, as were the characters in Malle's film.  The entire story is about the inevitability of change and how it affects each of its characters.  The choices these characters make and think about making lift the film to the level of a modern cinema classic.  'Atlantic City' deserves to be seen because of its great performances, expert direction, and very good writing.  Watching 'Atlantic City' is like watching a good novel unfold right before your eyes.

The city creates a unique Utopia for these people.  The dread of the once-famous boardwalk is progressively resurrected as the new home of fun and luxury.

1192059,5,B000006561,"Louis Malle's films often have a small theatre intimacy to them. Malle is interested in drawing real life portraits of real life characters in their real life settings. Pretty Baby was the film that immediately preceded this one and was set in 1917 New Orleans and also starred Susan Sarandon. That film was as much a study of a time and a place as it was of the characters involved & Atlantic City is similar in scope but both the portrait of the characters and their city is much more complete. In the Atlantic City of 1980 the city is past its heyday and has not yet been rebuilt. There is the past city preserved and embodied by Lancaster & there is the new Atlantic City just on the horizon represented by the wide eyed and dreaming Sarandon. Those two main characters occupy the same building but they share a space only in the most general sense as each inhabits their own version of the city. Lancaster is man who never really had a prime and has sustained himself with his lively imagination which has preserved a kind of childish readiness in him. In his real life he has always fled when things got heated up and so he has never really begun to live, and late in life a growing regret as well as his glimpses of Sarandon through her apartment window has sparked that youth into action. This time he will seize his moments and make the most of them. And he gets his opportunity. Sarandon has her sites set on self improvement. She listens to opera, teaches herself French and dreams of a future dealing cards in Monaco. Her dreams have so far come to nothing and she is just at that point where a stroke of luck could mean the difference between finally beginning to live and resigning herself to  her own private and quiet desperation. Lancaster & Sarandon are magic together, and though the film is sometimes awkward like a rehearsal, that awkwardness is part of the small theatre charm. Lancaster nails every line and every scene like the master that he is, Sarandon is the novice who hits and misses but she has some immeasurable and indefinable inner quality, she virtually glows with it, that makes her infinitely watchable and when she hits she knocks you over. Lancaster dreaming of the past and Sarandon dreaming of the future,and neither occupying the present. When Lancaster finally has his moment though, and his dream is realized there is no one left to share it with, just him smiling alone. And Sarandon gets her break too and finally makes her getaway in a stolen car driving away alone into some as yet undefined future w/ drug money tucked in her pocket, she too smiling to herself, still eager to learn French. Solitary dreamers to the end despite the decay all around.
This movie along with a few others released in late 70's(Ashby's Being There) and early eighties(Lumet's Verdict) were like a last few great gasps when movies were still interested in real life and offered a genuine look at it.",1017878400,9,2926,4.594646271510516

Atlantic City is the best movie made of its year and was vastly ignored as far as awards go. Its director, Louis Malle gives us a wonderful story of passion, lost memory and pipe dreams. Everywhere there seems to be decay, ruins, buildings being torn down, people deparate for a drug score, people holding on to the past, unable to cope with reality. John Guare wrote one of the smartest, funny, film scripts of all time, and each time I watch this gem of a film, I find more verbal riches, more warth, humanity, great and subtle humor, and surpise. Burt Lancaster, as Lou the small time hoodlum and numbers man, is a wonder to behold; how many actors have this great a performance so late in a long career and this performance ranks with his best? Susan Sarandon's performance is great also, showing beauty, tenderness, toughness, and sadness. The suppoting cast, like the great Kate Reid as the widow of ""Cookie"" Pinza, steal scenes left and write. When asked if Reid was a Miss America contestant Lou replies ""She was more like Miss Pinball Machine."" Malle directs the vilolence well but doen't overdo it-his mobsters are scary and believable but well played. The cinematography is wonderful and there is a burnished light around the locations, the buildings and the air full of the salty spray of decadence. The most beautiful scene, Lancaster watching Sarandon bathe her upper body in lemon juice is magical, as in the ritual she turns on an opera tape and is watched and coveted my an aging man. The scene is never lurid but just the opposite-sexy, bright and full of warmth,the camera going back and forth between Lancaster's eyes and his goddess getting the fish market smell where she works off and is just as stunning as the rest of the film.
