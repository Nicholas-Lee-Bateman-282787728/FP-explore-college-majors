7027569,5,B00U2KQV7E,"Loved  it
Shared it with my congregation. Close to the word
Always looking for movies like this to share others Some people associate better when they visualize certain accounts. Then it's easier to share the gospel with them",1437436800,2,225,4.921052631578948

7027573,5,B00U2KQV7E,"I love this video. I have watched it at least once a day, and I use this video to sleep with so my subconcious soaks it in too. This video makes alot of sense when the Historian tells the story of Jesus' last week before the ascent. I hope amazon gets everything the author has ever wrote.  Please watch this with theppl in your family. Very educational.",1432252800,4,354,4.2835820895522385
7027574,5,B00U2KQV7E,"Very interesting and enlightening.  I'm not a fan of Documentaries - but this one is great!  It is not boring - not monotone- and so on.  I love the pictures they show as well as the information they give from many reliable sources.
  I would like to see more sections of the Bible in videos like this.",1431907200,2,302,4.228070175438597

7027589,5,B00U2KQV7E,"Possessing more degrees than a thermometer I probably know about as much as you can know about Jesus Christ and still be considered sane. HA ! However from an anthropological and archaeological perspective this program touches a deep well of knowledge within me and says "" this is probably pretty close to the truth "". No one who watches it intently with an open
Mind will be disappointed . Can't wait to see it again !",1464825600,3,419,4.526315789473684

7027591,5,B00U2KQV7E,It was a good movie. Short and to the point. Well done and orthodox teaching from a Catholic point of view.,1461801600,,107,4.142857142857143
7027592,3,B00U2KQV7E,"I don't agree with everything, it is Hollywood.",1461283200,,47,5.0
7027593,5,B00U2KQV7E,"Fast-moving. Not dry, at all, as some videos that I've seen on the subject. The thing that impressed me the most was facts that the video brought out about the Final Week that I had heard nowhere else, but were very insightful and/or powerful.",1461110400,2,243,4.545454545454546
7027594,5,B00U2KQV7E,I used this with middle school students during Holy Week. Both students and faculty found it interesting and well done.,1459209600,,119,5.0
7027595,5,B00U2KQV7E,The historical writings outside of the bible about the new testament period are interesting.,1459209600,,92,5.642857142857143

7027600,3,B00U2KQV7E,"Very FAST moving and SHORT documentary! Not necessarily a bad thing but a different style for sure. The historian is excellent and interesting to listen to, and the quality of the film is good overall. There are strong points which ground the resurrection of Messiah in history (where it actually took place) and reminds viewers of the historical reality which our theology is built upon...very cool :) However, he could have elaborated much more in specific areas....no biggie though. Good intro video to the resurrection....good for non-Christian friends or family.",1456185600,,567,5.311111111111111

7027604,1,B00U2KQV7E,"Cheerfully neglects the fact that there is zero historical evidence for the existence of Jesus anywhere in Roman, Greek, or Jewish records.  Even the specious paragraph in Josephus was discredited within a century of Josephus' writing.  This is acceptable as a work of fiction, but not as a documentary.",1454112000,,303,5.163265306122449
7027605,5,B00U2KQV7E,Very rarely is good scholarship combined with captivating storytelling and decent (if limited) acting in a documentary. Not bad,1451952000,,127,5.7368421052631575

7027609,4,B00U2KQV7E,I have been a Christian more than 30 years. I enjoyed seeing the places of the Bible. It was great to watch a film so factual. I felt like I am learning the Bible with a personal tutor.,1445731200,,185,3.8947368421052633

7027612,5,B00U2KQV7E,"This is a brief introduction to some of the points of reason which indicate the basic reliability of the biblical accounts of the final week of Christ's life on earth. Dr. Maier puts forth arguments which demonstrate the rationality of these points of reason with transparency. While this brief introduction does not highlight the major responses of critics to the reasoning, it is not intended to be a debate. Rather, the points stand by their own merit and will help those who desire to think more rationally about their faith. This may of may not persuade non-believers to embrace the historical accuracy of the biblical account. However, it will certainly prove helpful to them if they wish to have a very basic understanding of why Christians believe (and have believed since the time of Christ and his resurrection).",1442448000,9,822,4.963768115942029

7027616,5,B00U2KQV7E,Very good movie and would watch it again.,1438992000,,41,4.25
8703987,5,B00U2KQV7E,"The video was wonderful.  It held the attention of all of the participants of our adult Bible study.  He presented factual Biblical material but in a modern day context - even humorous at time.  We thoroughly enjoyed and we would highly recommend the video.  In fact, we are considering finding another one of his videos for future study sessions.",1523232000,,347,4.830508474576271
8703988,2,B00U2KQV7E,"It is okay, but compared to the Road to Emmaus this movie is poor.",1517529600,,66,3.7857142857142856
8703989,4,B00U2KQV7E,"I truly enjoyed this presentation of the Resurrection week and all the information available from extra-biblical sources that also support the reality that Christ did truly die and rise again.

Admittedly, the acting and cinematography were sub-par. However, it is the content that has the most value in my opinion.",1499644800,,315,5.3
8703990,2,B00U2KQV7E,"While I like the message, I was really sad that it was so short!  I heard this movie pimped on the radio for a month and didn't realize it was just a little episode.  I paid a lot for a little episode.  I'll read the finer print more often now.  If you can get this for under a $5, though, top notch.",1498608000,,300,3.7903225806451615
8703991,5,B00U2KQV7E,Very inspirational.,1498176000,,19,9.0
8703992,5,B00U2KQV7E,We used this at our Sunday Morning Bible study a couple of weeks before Easter. What an awesome video. Dr. Maier is a real treasure for the church. He brings information to the conversation that you normally don't get from other sources. I have a couple of copies of the video that I keep on hand to loan to others.,1495065600,2,315,4.266666666666667
8703993,4,B00U2KQV7E,I would have liked it to been longer with more details and information that I could examin for mayself.,1493596800,,103,4.473684210526316
8703994,5,B00U2KQV7E,"A great presentation on the accounts of Holy Week. The narrator uses persuasive presentation for a thought provoking documentary. Worth the 33, pun intended, minute film.",1493424000,,170,5.576923076923077
8703995,5,B00U2KQV7E,"Shorter than I thought it might be, but still very interesting, educating and so accurate. I almost hate to see movies that have evidence and stuff about Christ because I want to just have total faith in Him. I do have total faith in Him however, so it is just astonishing how much evidence exists that proves the bible over and over again. It is almost (or is in my opinion) common sense because of all that has been discovered and just the fact no man can make a human from nothing let alone all the planets and just the way the universe cooperates and complements one another. Nothing cannot create everyone and everything from nothing...Except the God of the bible.",1489708800,6,669,4.537190082644628
8703996,5,B00U2KQV7E,Really enjoyed this.,1484438400,,20,6.0
