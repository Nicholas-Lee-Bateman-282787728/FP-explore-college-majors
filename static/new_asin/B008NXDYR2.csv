But if you are actually looking for a kettle bell workout video, this probably won't fit what you are looking for.",1431043200,,254,4.666666666666667
8529274,5,B008NXDYR2,"This video is my first introduction to working out with a kettle bell and I was blown away. I started out absolutely ignorant on the subject without previous training. In a way; it's really a teaser to the other video work series they have but it's literally more than enough for me. I HIGHLY recommend it!! You won't be disappointed with the purchase. Cautionary words of advice. Less can equal more sometimes. I like to lift heavy weights when working out. I work heavy labor sometimes in my employment as well. I thought I could treat this the same way. WRONG! I bought a 5lb kettle bell for starters and it's sufficient enough right now. The movements really targets areas I ""thought"" was I strong with full range motion exercises which I never did enough of. Overall; this is a new dimension for me. I'm enjoying it and hope to work into a little heavier ""manly"" weight. ROFL! Who am I kidding. Thanks, Kettleworx.",1411689600,,919,4.609756097560975
