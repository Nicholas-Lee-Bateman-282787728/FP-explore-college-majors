8372133,5,B002KMUS6C,"Ordered this set of four because of ""Stone Pillow.""  I watched this Lucille Ball movie long ago, and it was very impressive to me.  I worked much with street people in California, and my heart cries out to those whose spirits are broken and they seem unable to rise above the turmoil of life.  What seems to be a very sad life on the streets seems very different from the nowadays life of being able to find places to eat and sleep.  Back then, it was not so easy.  But...what has happened to the less fortunaate who are unable to find the help they need to bring them back to a positive life?  Great story with lots of food for thought!",1404000000,,637,4.223140495867769
