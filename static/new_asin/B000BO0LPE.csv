Don't miss the extra featurettes-- they are really great-- too bad some of those scenes were deleted!!

Hey it isn't shakespeare, not meant to be-- it is a comedy !! it's a great ecscape with beautiful girls, beautiful beaches and a talented team of actors-- You'll enjoy it!!",1136505600,13,550,4.591836734693878
2430802,5,B000BO0LPE,"I just got my copy of Cloud 9 in the mail.  It is great.

This is the funniest comedy in a long time and the beach scenes sure make this winter a lot warmer.

The Bonsais are the sexiest group of chicks since Charlie's Angels.

Angie Everheart is excellent.

And the script is really sharp.

Burt Reynolds looks like he's having a blast.

And the extras are neat too.  ""Hoosiers Meets Hooters"" is really funny. Whoever made that should direct the sequel.

And I hope there's a sequel!",1136332800,8,484,4.409090909090909
2430803,5,B000BO0LPE,"This might be the funniest movie I have seen all year.

The script is great.

And the women are really hot!  Angie Everhart has never looked better than she does in a red bikini, Gabrielle Reece is a GODDESS and the four women who play the Bonsais are super sexy, in every flavor!

This is definitely worth the price!",1135814400,8,317,4.322033898305085
2430804,5,B000BO0LPE,"Did I miss this in theaters?

Because the Bandit is back!  Burt Reynolds is in great form as the coach of a beach volleyball team made up of strippers. Better than Hazzard, better than Longest Yard, it's a raunchy, sly ensemble comedy with a smart script and lots of laughs.

As a longtime fan, I was glad to see this wasn't a cameo role for Burt, but that he's in nearly every scene, and he's surrounded by a young, all-star cast, including Angie Everhart and Gabrielle Reece.

The movie is set in Malibu, and most of it takes place on the beach, so there is lots of skin shown off (and the unbelieveable ""booty"" of ex-Miss Usa Kenya Moore.  That deserves an award of its own).  DL Hughley is very funny as Burt's ""son,"" and Paul Rodriguez should get an Oscar (no kidding) for his part as a Chinese man named Wong (no kidding).

This movie has a great pedigree too. The great script was co-written by Al Ruddy, who won the Best Picture Oscar (!) for Million Dollar Baby, and also did the original Longest Yard and Cannonball Run movies.  And Grey Fredericksen who won the Oscar for Godfather Two is another producer.

The DVD also has very funny extras that are as good and funny as the movie (""Hoosiers meets Hooters"" is the name of one extra and that says it all).

Cloud 9 will be tops in any sports movie collection.  And it stands up with Dodgeball and Anchorman and 40 Year Old Virgin and Wedding Crashers as a funny guy's movie.",1135641600,6,1436,4.381132075471698

8089762,5,B000BO0LPE,I REALLY ENJOY ANTHING THAT BURT REYNOLDS HAS DONE. HE IS UNDERESTIMATED FOR THE PERFORMANCES IN HIS MOVIES.  I THINK HE IS THE BEST,1391817600,,132,4.5
8089763,4,B000BO0LPE,"This is pure entertainment and comedy.  A mix of an over-the-hill actor (Burt Reynolds) with a young cast makes this a huge hit.  Some actors try to maintain their early years on the reels.  Reynolds has found his niche...much like the classic comedy ""The Crew"".  Paul Rodriguez was priceless...from Chinaman to Chicano.  The only reason I gave it 4-of-5 stars is that there's no quality acting beyond Reynolds and Rodriguez.  If you want to laugh and enjoy a film with character, this one's for you.",1300752000,,500,4.823529411764706
8089764,4,B000BO0LPE,"I saw the promo for this on You Tube and thought it would be something my husband and I could watch- instead of summer reruns,  I figured I like Burt he likes strippers and we both like volleyball- so there you have it
  I liked the movie and did not find it offensive at all- and my husband actually found some parts humorous- he's not an easy audience,
So all in all I would say that it's worth it - I will probably watch it a  few times- the cameos are really good- especially Gary Busey's.  With all the hype he's getting lately it's good to see him act normal!!",1216684800,,566,4.109090909090909
8089765,4,B000BO0LPE,"I'm trying to look at this film as more of a ""babefest"" than the actual ""cheesefest"" that it happens to be.  Starring Mr. Superficial himself, Burt Reynolds.  The humor and style of this film is just like the ""Cannonbal Run"" films and of ""Stroker Ace"" back in the early eighties.  However, thank God this movie didn't have Dom Deloise like some of Burt's other films did.

I wanted to see this film because it had both Angie Everheart and the super gorgeous Kenya Moore in it.  Kenya's right up there with Vanity.  A gorgeous black girl that ends up in ""low-budget"" non-award winning Saturday afternoon screen fodder.  They must have had bad movie agents.  I'm sure Burt Reynolds couldn't care if anything he does nowadays makes any impact in the movies anymore.  He's got all the money he needs.

I'd be happy to be paid even just ten dollars to work with Kenya Moore and Angie Everheart and those other ""hotties"" in this film.  You go Burt!  You know what you want.  Do you have anymore ""babefests"" coming up?",1210636800,2,1011,4.581005586592179
8089766,5,B000BO0LPE,"I would like to say that this is the Burt that made me see the movie Smokey and the Bandit over 50 times, that's right 50 times.  This film should have made the big screen.  I have six children ranging from 5yrs.-17yrs. all have seen Cloud 9 about a dozen times.  It's completely for all ages. I haven't been entertained from begining to end from a picture in a long time.  The whole concept is original and fresh.  Welcome back Burt... You're the man..",1139270400,8,453,4.345238095238095
8089767,5,B000BO0LPE,"I just got this movie in the mail and really enjoyed it. Burt Reynolds is hilarious and Angie Everhart is still stunningly beautiful. Overall, a very enjoyable flick.",1137369600,12,166,4.964285714285714
8089768,5,B000BO0LPE,"This movie is really enjoyable. Ignore ""Sooner Crooner"" who also has only one review and does not realize that movies screen for test audiences all the time. I saw this movie months ago. It is wrong that this movie was shot long ago. A friend of mine on vacation in LA saw them filming on the beach.

Gabrielle Reece was excellent. I was very surprised to learn that she is an athlete. Similarly, I saw Tara Lipinski in The Metro Chase recently and had the same thought about her. Why do athletes and singers usually make good actors? Are they so accustomed to being in the spotlight that they are just completely relaxed? This is a good movie!",1137024000,7,644,4.4576271186440675
8089769,5,B000BO0LPE,"Hey I don't know who ""Sooner Crooner"" is, but I think her wishlists and other details are pretty disturbing.

This is MY first review and I'M not a producer, but I do know I bought Cloud 9 and I think it is REALLY COOL.  (And I don't see many past reviews by ""Sooner Crooner,"" but that's notthe point.)

I think Cloud 9 ROCKS.

The script is GREAT and DEEP and that Paul Rodriguez's character is offensive only if you don't watch the movie.  ""In Malibu, if you're a Latino you're a gardener but if you're Aisan, you're a landscaping artist"" is why ""Juan"" becomes ""Wong.""

This is real funny movie.  Burt Reynolds rules!  And this movie is full of stars.

So here's my FIVE STARS!",1136505600,10,679,4.368
