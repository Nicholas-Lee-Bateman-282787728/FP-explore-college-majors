7897350,3,6305838461,"Seduction Cinema puts out a lot of bad films alongside a good handful of pretty darn entertaining films; it's usually either all or nothing with these guys.  Mistress of Seduction doesn't fit the bill, really; this film falls flat early on and stays there.  The story certainly afforded the filmmakers a golden opportunity to give us fans what we want, but all we got was a whole lot of not much.  Alysabeth Clements stars as Vamparina, a centuries-old vampire who has been tracking down the soul who killed her father long, long ago (her father was supposedly Count Dracula himself according to the movie summaries I've seen,  but nothing in the movie really pointed me to such a conclusion).  Clements is not really my idea of beautiful, but she does do a little sizzling of the screen with that vampiress attire of hers and that smoldering red hair.  With the help of her latest lesbian victim, she finally discovers the location of her hated nemesis John (who doesn't even know what he did in his past life).  As it happens, John's sister is also a lesbian, so there are all sorts of sexual goings-on taking place on both sides of the storyline.  Unfortunately, all of these little girl-girl get-togethers are exceedingly boring; nothing happens beyond some kissing and heavy petting, and you won't find any complete nudity in this movie.  I only emphasize this point because the same cannot be said of the vast majority of Seduction Cinema movies.
On a more positive note, the filmmakers did at least emphasize the horror aspect of the whole vampire thing this time around.  It's true they played weird noises that sounded like someone crunching into dry cereal every time a vampire sank her teeth into someone's jugular, but it's also true that we actually do get to see blood and just a tiny, tiny amount of gore here.  Little good can be said of the acting; I thought Alysabeth Clements was pretty good as Vamparina, but the other actors and actresses brought very little to their roles.  In one scene, two buddies are having a heated argument, yet both of them look bored to death throughout the scene.
If you are a fan of vampire films, especially lesbian vampire films, Mistress of Seduction does have a little bit to offer you.  If you are only interested in the types of sexual escapades frequently featured in other Seduction Cinema films, though, you may find little more than disappointment here.",1075420800,6,2412,4.769230769230769
7897351,1,6305838461,"For those of you who enjoy a few naked vampires, this movie will only be partly fullfilling - example, a woman gets in the bath, but she's still wearing her panties! What's the point in that? The plot is minimal, a vampire woman must seduce a man because he killed her master in a previous re-incarnation!? Talk about stupid. This film's also shot on video, so don't expect a big-budget effect. Leave this one behind.",1008979200,2,417,4.573333333333333
7897352,1,6305838461,"As dedicated fans of this genre, my wife and I were extremely disappointed to find that this ""film"" (it really doesn't have the level of quality to be classified as such) was just another badly-acted low-browed poorly-scripted non-erotic blunder.  Watching this was a waste of our time, and it will be a waste of yours, as well.  This is the first movie that we're actually trying to return; we want our money back, and even if we do get the money we're still going to regret spending the time to watch it.
As another point of irritation, the other reviews here praised this film.  Why?  The film was beyond bad, and it leaves me wondering what the other reviewers were thinking.  One of the most valuable services that Amazon offers are these product reviews; I'm sorry that (at least on this occasion) the reviews were clearly misleading.
Don't watch this film.  You'll be sorry if you do :(",1008115200,3,893,4.620253164556962
7897353,4,6305838461,"A vamp story with naturally beautiful girls.  I was surprised when I saw  this one.  Quite a few laughs between erotic scenes, and, for the most  part, a pretty compelling story.
Don't be confused, this is not  Interview with the Vampire - but it's by far the most daring vamp/erotica  production I've seen.  Well worth it...you'll watch it more than once.",968803200,5,356,4.737704918032787
