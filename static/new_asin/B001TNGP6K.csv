8342133,3,B001TNGP6K,Nice documentary but poorly edited. There are big gaps of about a minute with just nothing in them. The screen goes black. Also the description talks about the restoration of a 1978 Corvette. This is wrong. The restoration is of a 1988 Corvette.,1437350400,,245,4.72093023255814
8342134,1,B001TNGP6K,"The documentary itself was great. My issue was with the playback. HUGE gaps between scenes , long enough that the playback would assume the show was over. Very annoying.",1435276800,,169,4.862068965517241
8342135,3,B001TNGP6K,"We rented this video expecting to see a rebuilding of a 1978 Corvette as the description above says.  After we started watching the video it rapidly became apparent that this video features a 1988 Corvette not a '78.

So buyer beware; you're not getting what is advertised.

As for a rating on the video itself, the content is good, but the editing leaves a little to be desired.  There are several ""breaks"" or blackouts where the screen goes blank for 30 seconds or so.  Obviously this was setup for commercials on a broadcast channel, but they should have been edited out before releasing to video.

Because of the ""false advertising"" and bad editing, I can only give this video 3 out of 5.  Fans of the C4 Corvette will still find a lot to love though.",1337299200,,755,4.507352941176471
