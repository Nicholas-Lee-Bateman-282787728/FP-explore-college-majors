4334716,5,B004DTS1A0,Mr. Rogers never disappoints.  My 3 year old grandson loves him and all the neighbors on his show.  We have purchased several of these DVDs and I think he will be watching them for years to come.  What great lessons he teaches.,1409184000,3,227,4.357142857142857
4334717,5,B004DTS1A0,I like the slow pace of Mr. Roger's and the positive moral values. I think children of every generation should know how to watch simple television that teaches good messages. This video does that.,1393027200,9,196,4.794117647058823
4334718,3,B004DTS1A0,The last episodes freezes at the end.  Otherwise I am pleased with it. Glad I can purchase Mr. Rogers videos,1392595200,3,108,4.4
4334719,3,B004DTS1A0,We loved the values-centered teaching of this series for our children when they were babies. We wanted to share them with our grand daughter. But we have since discovered Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood which is faster paced for the more modern age and covers many of the same lessons as Mr. Rogers. We watch it with our grand daughter and she likes it but it is slower in pace than the new series. Also it does not contain some of our favorite episodes from the show.,1391126400,2,464,4.470588235294118

4334722,5,B004DTS1A0,"We have been buying Mr. Rogers videos since the triplets were 18 months old.  They loved them - instantly -- and still like to watch them.  They learned about etiquette, friendship and music from these videos.  Mr. Rogers is very appropriate for children today.  I believe all children can benefit from his shows.  Try them!!!",1329436800,10,326,4.8545454545454545
8426101,5,B004DTS1A0,"He is truly missed. Now kids shows consist of flatulence, yelling, nose picking, over loading your senses with neon colors, belching, and hitting. Maybe I'm getting old, but I miss Mr. Rogers style.",1526256000,,198,5.03030303030303
8426102,2,B004DTS1A0,I love Mister Rogers Neighborhood and was really excited to share the shows with my kids. While the video is just fine the audio is quite awful. The first disk skips frequently and the second has a high pitch frequency ringing through it.,1520121600,,238,4.558139534883721
