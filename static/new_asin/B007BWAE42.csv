8655196,2,B007BWAE42,"This movie is in Mandarin with English subtitles.  All the famous beloved Hong Kong movie/tv stars of the 1980s are in this film.  This is a classic of 1982, and these are some of the best actors of their time.  However, this movie had no real story to it.  The kung-fu are well choreographed, but people are fighting for no apparent reason.  Two neighbors with the same kung-fu master compete all the time to see who is the best until each of them meet and impress the emperor one day.  The emperor loses his royal stamp/seal that proves he's the emperor, so he sends these two crazies to help him get back the royal seal.  In the end they get it, but that's the simplicity of this story.  The two neighbors argue and tries to out-do each other from beginning of the movie to the end. A very boring movie.",1516665600,,806,4.326666666666667
