8559893,4,B00AZUEU56,"I attended school at Camp Zama, Kanagawa-ken, Japan during the filming of this movie in 1969. I recall seeing the location film crew shooting one scene in front of our campus. Sadly, I never got see the movie when it was released the following year. It had never been shown in the U.S. I spent over 40 years looking for it, but learned it had  not been put on VHS or DVD until this past February (2013). The scenery is spectacular and the  scenes shot on Camp Zama brought back a flood of memories of my youth. Natsukashi!",1377388800,2,522,4.316326530612245
