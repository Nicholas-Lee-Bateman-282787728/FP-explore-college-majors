7562784,1,B0194E6CGI,"DVD only?!?!? is this 2016 or 1998?

Why don't they go back to doing standard definition PPV's only while they're at it?",1455148800,8,120,4.454545454545454
7562785,1,B0194E6CGI,Thanks once again for releasing this on DVD in 2016 where a lot of us actually prefer to watch sports in Hi-Def. Money saved 2nd year running!!!,1454889600,9,144,4.37037037037037
7562786,5,B0194E6CGI,"Great compilation. While some may not love these Best of's, I have always found them great, as it gets some of the best matches of the year in one place.",1460764800,,153,4.133333333333334
7562787,1,B0194E6CGI,Can't wait for next year when they finally release on cassette tape and we have to use our imagination to think about whats happening!!! I will not support this trash. They should be giving us 4K instead of DVD... shame on UFC.,1459900800,3,227,4.428571428571429
7562788,1,B0194E6CGI,No blu ray? Ufc is getting cheap like the pay to its fighters,1458950400,4,61,3.769230769230769
7562789,4,B0194E6CGI,This DVD comes in a two-disc format. The first disc contains a two hour recap of the year with highlights from the biggest fights. The narration can be a little boring but the action makes up for it. The second disc contains full fights. I enjoyed the content and think it's a great value for the price.,1458950400,,303,4.333333333333333
7562790,4,B0194E6CGI,"UFC Best of 2015 differs from the previous year's DVD's in that instead of reviewing the whole year in chronological order (Jan-Dec), they review each weight class beginning with Womens Bantamweight division, then Womens straw weight division, and then up the ladder in all the Men's divisions (flyweight-heavyweight). Overall I would say the DVD is pretty good only thing I wish is that they showcase more of the fights that happened in 2015. They tended to focus more on top 5 fighters in each weight class rather than the UFC as a whole.

I do love the fact that they added the extra disc with the full fights included as they did in the UFC 2014s Best of DVD. The full fights that come with the extra disc are as follows:

1. UFC 182: Jones vs. Cormier
2. UFC 184: Rousey vs. Zingano
3. UFC 185: Esparza vs. Jedrzejczyk
4. UFC 187: Browne vs. Arlovski
5. UFC 189: Lawler vs. MacDonald 2
6. UFC 189: Mendes vs. McGregor
7. UFC 190: Rousey vs. Correia
8. UFC 192: Cormier vs. Gustafsson
9. UFC 193: Rousey vs. Holm
10. UFC 194: Aldo vs. McGregor

**For those voting this 1 star. They sell as advertised and if it doesn't say Blue-ray then don't expect to receive a blue-ray. I would have voted this 5 stars but I'm not sure how I feel about the new format in which they decided to review the year.",1458086400,10,1299,4.381742738589212
7562791,1,B0194E6CGI,"Perfect, I will just go pop this is my DVD player, right next to my laser disc player, and 8 track.",1458086400,3,99,3.761904761904762
7562792,3,B0194E6CGI,"As is the custom with these past couple years ""Best of"" DVDs the first disc is a highlight reel of performances from the UFC. It's edited very poorly and you are often seeing only half of a fight finishing sequence.

Only ten full fights are featured on the second disc:

UFC 182: Jones Vs Cormier
UFC 184: Rousey Vs Zingano
UFC 185: Esparza Vs Jedzrejczyk
UFC 187: Browne Vs Arlovski
UFC 189: Lawler Vs MacDonald 2
UFC 189: McGregor Vs Mendes
UFC 190: Rousey Vs Correia
UFC 192: Cormier Vs Gustaffson
UFC 193: Rousey Vs Holm
UFC 194: Aldo Vs McGregor",1458000000,28,551,4.445544554455446
7562793,2,B0194E6CGI,"I would love to own the best of UFC 2015 on blu-ray, but I'm not going to buy the DVD. No one cares about the year's highlights. We want those bonus fights!! I don't know what's so hard to understand about that. Last year, with the best of 2014, they failed. It looks like they didn't learn anything from their failure. I was really looking forward to the best of 15 on blu-ray. UFC, please, don't let me down again this year. Give us a ton of fights on blu-ray. Please. I was being generous by giving the DVD 2 stars, but blu-ray is worth at least 4-5 stars.",1456531200,10,559,4.137614678899083
7562794,1,B0194E6CGI,"No vhs no buy! UFC is spitting in your face my trailer park dwelling, vcr using, no fight pass having friends!
Stand up and demand a proper vhs release on 2 tapes.",1456099200,7,163,4.125
7562795,1,B0194E6CGI,"Not much content on this release and not on blu ray like other reviews state.  Again it is like they are going backwards instead of forwards.  We go from being able to watch best of 2013 in 1080i resolution to 480i resolution for the best of 2015.  Will only buy if it is on blu ray, but even then needs more content.",1455235200,6,317,4.080645161290323

8743920,3,B0194E6CGI,"I've been buying all the UFC DVD for my dad as they come out and he loved it.  Suddenly about 6 months ago, the DVD prices spiked from less than $20 to $49.99!  I am not willing to pay for an UFC DVD that is over a month after the actual fight.  Fortunately, this Best of 2015 DVD came out at a very reasonable price so I picked it up.  It's not as good as getting the individual UFC fights but at least it's affordable.",1466208000,2,420,3.9058823529411764
