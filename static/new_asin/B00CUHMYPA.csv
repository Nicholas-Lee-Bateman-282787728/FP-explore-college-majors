5741960,5,B00CUHMYPA,"There are 3 threads which make this story extremely compelling.
  First, there is the 100 year history of the race. The glory years were in the early 50's where Mike Hailwood and other riders representing Honda dominated the race and transformed Honda from a company nobody had ever heard of to a dominant force in Motorcycles, and eventually automobiles.
  Second, there is the rural countryside- which looks straight out of how I would imagine Iowa looked like in the 30's.
All the race courses of today have a 30 yard obstacle free zone and various gravel and tire barriers on either side of the course. They are also 2 or 3 miles long, so they can be learned. This course is 37 1/2 miles long and has rock walls, narrow, humped bridges and other obstacles which have long since been banned from any course meeting todays standards.
Third, the announcing crew is excellent. (In earlier years they were too British centric for me) These guys are really good- they make sense to an american audience, they are respectful of the traditions of the place, and they tell a good story.
Oh, and there is this technology story, where a little known american team from Oregon is running an Electric Motorcycle which runs faster than the ones which Mike Hailwood rode to put Honda on the map.",1385078400,5,1284,4.668141592920354

5741962,4,B00CUHMYPA,"Every year the coverage improves with better footage and commentary.  One thing this year was that they didn't really break out the non-racing portion of coverage (Mad Sunday, etc.) so that you can easily find it and navigate to it.  Instead, it's part of the overall coverage captured from the TV coverage.",1378339200,,307,4.884615384615385

8586557,5,B00CUHMYPA,I have viewed this DVD several times and feel the purchase was a good one.  I have been a motorcycle enthusiast for many years and I believe the DVD supplies a better understanding of Isle of Man and increased my appreciation of how difficult this race truly is.  On board video cameras give the viewer a good idea of what it must be like to ride one of these extremely powerful and fast motorcycles.,1432684800,,400,4.391891891891892
