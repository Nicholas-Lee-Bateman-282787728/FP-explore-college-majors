Not everyone enjoys these types of shows learning about equipment, big tools, how things work, etc - but Matt's energy and humor makes it interesting for people that might be bored with the typical educational show.",1434412800,,308,5.019607843137255

Recommended to all those who like to know how big things work.",1193529600,,260,4.931818181818182
8204555,5,B000S6LS2A,"I have been a huge fan of Matt Rogers ever since he was a contestant on season 3 of ""American Idol"". I think he has such a great personality. He's funny, quick witted, not full of himself, a real down to earth likable kind of guy. So when I read that he would be hosting a show called ""Really Big Things"" on Discovery Channel, I made a point to tune in. And, let me say, I love it. This show is really informative without ever being boring. Matt is the perfect host for this kind of program. His sense of humor and willingness to learn and participate keeps the show light and fun yet it is still educational and entertaining. I watch it every week and am very glad it was renewed for a second season. I cannot wait until September 4th to get the first season on DVD. Thanks Discovery for bringing us Matt Rogers & Really Big Things.",1185321600,2,833,4.2125
