2584006,4,B000FSMEBA,this was the last season of Good times. the show lost alot of it's steam after John Amos left the show. the writing took a  hurting though bringing Janet Jackson on board was a important story-line. too this day I'm still in love with Bern Nadette Stanis. Thelma is still One Fine Looking Lady. YESS DOUBLE LAWWDD SWEET JESUS!!! anyway it's good that Florida Evans Esther Rolle came back to the show. glad to see the family get to move on out of the Hood. the show was must see tv&more than a Catch-phrase.,1154217600,,506,4.382978723404255

2584010,5,B000FSMEBA,"The 1978-79 season,the sixth and final of CBS's Good Times brought a few changes amongst the cast and plot. The late Esther Rolle,who was written out for 1977-78,returned to the show by popular demand. Rolle was jealously disappointed by the abundant attention Jimmie Walker's character James ""J.J."" Evans Jr. was receiving. J.J. became increasingly popular since the 1974 premiere. Rolle's character Florida Evans,mother of J.J.,Thelma(Bern Nadette Stanis) and Michael(Ralph Carter),took Carl Dixon(the late Moses Gunn) to be her second husband. It was written that Florida and Carl had been on their extended honeymoon throughout 1977-78. Carl owned and operated a repair shop that Michael worked at part-time after school and on weekends. Florida met Carl when one day,back in season 4,she came to the shop to discuss a matter or two with Michael. Carl fell in love with Florida but she was not ready for a new mate(Florida lost her first husband James Sr. in a Mississippi auto accident-explained in the season 4 premiere). In reality,James Sr.'s portrayer John Amos was fired after the end of season 3. Sadly,Carl had been diagnosed with lung cancer and he and Florida spent some time in Arizona for the sake of his health. Willona Woods(Ja 'Net Dubois),the Evans' neighbor and friend served as a mother figure for the Evans children while Florida was on her honeymoon with Carl. Willona is still a loving mother to Penny Gordon(superstar Janet Jackson who joined the cast at the beginning of season 5). Popping into the Evans' apartment often like Willona is landlord Nathan Bookman(Johnny Brown,who became a regular in season 5 also). Nathan,nicknamed ""Buffalo Butt"" and by Willona,""Booger"",claims that the Evanses were his favorite tenants despite a series of warnings from previous seasons. Joining the GT cast this season is Ben Powers who plays aspiring football player Keith Anderson. Keith and Thelma are husband and wife. If only James Sr. lived to see the wedding(viewers saw it). At the Keith-Thelma wedding,J.J. accidentally trips over Keith's already-injured foot. Keith lived at the Evans' apartment while he recuperated. After the full recuperation,he joins the Chicago Bears! J.J.,an aspiring painter,is a businessman himself. He taught art at home. I dedicate this item to the memory of Rolle who died at age 78 in 1998. CBS aired GT for the very last time on August 1,1979(logically,this item will be released exactly 27 years later). Today,Walker still does stand-up comedy. Almost seven weeks after the demise of GT,the sitcom's fellow resident All In The Family got the Nielsen axe also. But not the star character Archie Bunker. Archie was spun off on Archie Bunker's place for four seasons. GT was killed by The Dukes Of Hazzard,NBC's Diff'rent Strokes,ABC's Mork & Mindy and M&M's network mate Taxi.

Florida began working as maid for Beatrice Arthur's character Maude Finlay on AITF's spinoff Maude,which makes GT a ""grandchild"" of AITF. The sitcoms' creator Norman Lear became a multi-millionaire due to the popularity of the shows,including another AITF spinoff The Jeffersons which was in the Nielsen Top 10 when GT got cancelled.",1149292800,29,3163,5.238658777120316

2584068,4,B000FSMEBA,"""Good Times - The Complete Sixth Season"" contains many joyful moments for the Evanses. Two such moments are featured in the opening four-part episode titled ""Florida's Homecoming"" - where Thelma meets & falls head-over-heels in love with a professional athlete named Keith Anderson (played by Ben Powers). Keith, out of college, signs a contact to play professional football with the Chicago Bears. That's not all, for another momentous occasion smiles upon J.J., Michael & Thelma, as Florida Evans returns home upon Thelma's announcement of getting married. Esther Rolle rejoins the cast after being absent in Season Five over disputes of how the J.J. character was portrayed as being buffoonish, which is also partly the reason why John Amos left the series after Season Three. A bit of bad news dashes the family's hopes of getting out of the projects, as Keith injures his knee after his wedding. Throughout this season, in spite of the accident & having to work a nine to five regular job, he finds solace & support from his new wife & family. The accident has also taken its toll on Keith emotionally, as Keith suffers from mood swings & drinking binges in the episode ""The Evans' Dilemma"" - which has everyone on edge & concerned for Keith. The character of Sweet Daddy Williams (played by Teddy Wilson) is given a good dose of dialogue, just as he had been the previous few seasons. In ""The Witness"", J.J. unfortunately views an automobile accident involving Sweet Daddy's girlfriend, Savannah Morgan. Sweet's hired goons pressure J.J. into not telling the truth as to what really happened. ""Blood Will Tell"" finds Sweets in the hospital needing a blood transfusion from guess who...J.J.. Sweets' right-hand man makes sure J.J. doesn't squeal on him, so he has J.J. booked on a flight so ""Bad News"" could turn the table on Sweet Daddy through his bodyguards. Michael finds his current living situation is too crowded in the episode ""Michael's Decision"", so he decides to move in with a female roommate on campus to the chagrin of Florida. The Evanses have an opportunity to become homeowners in the episode ""House Hunting"", & Cousin Raymond stops by with wonderful news in ""Cousin Raymond"" - where Raymond has hit the jackpot courtesy of gambling. The happiest day of all is when J.J. & Keith spring wonderful news on the family - that J.J. has finally sold the rights to his comic book character, & that Keith has received a medical clearance that allows him to play football again. Thelma has news of her own to spring on Keith - she's pregnant! It's ""The End of the Rainbow"" (the final aired episode) for the Evanses, as they finally get out of the ghetto, & move into a swanky North Side apartment complex - where Willona & Penny move to after Willona receives a promotion as head buyer of her boutique. The series ends with Florida & Willona embracing hugs into each other's arms freeze-frame. As I said before - good things do come to those who wait. Don't wait to order ""Good Times - The Complete Sixth Season"". Get it ASAP!

R.I.P., Esther Rolle & Teddy Wilson.",1370908800,2,3077,4.805660377358491

2584074,3,B000FSMEBA,"I think every1 would agree that the show went down once John Amos was fired.  When one thinks of iconic episodes, they include him.  When James had hypertension, when his refrigerator had nothing but beer in it, when he got that gun, etc.  However, here's a later episode that is poignant with no Amos in sight.

I was speaking to a white high school friend who has hearing loss.  I was telling him, ""I think if you asked any Black person around my age and older about deaf issues, they would mention the deaf boy near the elevator on 'Good Times.'""  Remember this show was on before the ADA was passed on Capitol Hill, if I remember.  If you saw Spike Lee's film ""Girl 6,"" it spoke of a little Black girl who fell down an elevator shaft, so those fears are legitimate.  Nowadays, everything is ""post-this"" and ""post-that,"" I imagine folk of all ancestral backgrounds can relate to parents who are in denial about their childrens' limitations.  I really think this episode can be a great start to a discussion on deafness and youth.

I graduated before this happened, but I heard that some universities have a major called Disability Studies.  If that concentration looks at representations of the disabled in film and television, then this episode is something that its majors must see.  I can't say I've seen that many visual displays that juggle with issues of deafness, race, safety, and poverty all at once.",1362614400,,1412,4.672064777327935

2584077,5,B000FSMEBA,"Good Times season 6 is the final installment of in my opinion one of the best shows of the 70's.
Continuing the story of a black family living and loving in the ghetto of Chicago.
The regular cast members are back in this final season with Florida returning in time for Thelma's wedding. Although the show is definitely not the same as when it started in 1974 it has not faltered in quality. My favorite episodes are Stomach Mumps where Willona is very adiment at Penny's learning about sex....The Snow Storm Where Florida and her bus gets stranded in the snow and has to take cover in an abandoned apartment and my all time favorite a Matter of Mother where Lonella Gorden (Penny's mother) attempts to set Willona up. The show for me is goes back to what it use to be in the sense of it tackles issues that were not normally talked about in the 70's and coming from an African americans point of view it was a side that had yet to be accurately told from the side of the normal poor American. Good Times season 6 comes in a 3 disc set with no special features and yes the episodes are from the syndicated broadcast but I wouldn't throw stones at least they are released than not at all. If you are a fan from the beginning you will definitely wanna see the Evans family off in this final season. Enjoy.",1350345600,3,1303,4.322448979591837

I remember it from TV though and I have to say by the sixth season the sitcom had lost its initial vigor. The addition of Janet Jackson didn't do much to revive the ailing show, as it had lost at least two of its best actors. I would recommend it to the collector who has the rest of the collection, but not as a stand alone.",1201305600,4,583,4.114035087719298

Doesn't it look like they all sat there and specifically posed for this DVD? That's so cool. Does anyone know how Ralph Carter is? I remember reading some years back in The Enquirer that he is HIV-positive. I hope he is staying healthy.

The song for ""Good Times"" was written by Alan & Marilyn Bergman.

These are the opening-theme lyrics to ""Good Times""

Good Times.
Any time you meet a payment. - Good Times.
Any time you need a friend. - Good Times.
Any time you're out from under.
Not getting hassled, not getting hustled.
Keepin' your head above water,
Making a wave when you can.

Temporary lay offs. - Good Times.
Easy credit rip offs. - Good Times.
Scratchin' and surviving. - Good Times.
Hanging in and jiving- Good Times.
Ain't we lucky we got `em - Good Times

And, these are the closing-theme lyrics to ""Good Times""

Mmmmmm
Just lookin' out of the window.
Watchin' the asphalt grow.
Thinkin' how it all looks hand-me-down.
Good Times, yeah, yeah Good Times

Keepin' your head above water
Makin' a wave when you can

Temporary lay offs. - Good Times.

Florida's return and the addition of Keith brings more to the Evans' family home.  I enjoy watching each episode over and over.  This is much better TV than what today's network television has to offer.,1156032000,,369,4.242857142857143
2584088,5,B000FSMEBA,"The 6th and final season of Good Times is bittersweet for me. I own all the seasons on DVD and had watched them for years as re-runs. I am glad all the Evans' and Willona finally escape the projects, but sad that the show has to end. It's like they become your family, b/c the situations are so real. The struggles, heartaches, you feel them too. My fave episodes include the one with the deaf boy, Larry, I also liked the one were JJ has to donate blood to Sweet Daddy and the one were Florida and the kids get stuck out in a snowstorm. Good Times is and will always be one of my fave TV shows, ain't we lucky we got 'em? RIP Esther Rolle.",1154822400,7,640,4.047244094488189
2584089,4,B000FSMEBA,"Wow..the last season of ""Good Times."" Watching this last season, took me back to days of hanging out with the family eating chips and sipping on red Kool-Aid in Mississippi (Daddy James' homestate).

I like all seasons, but this one was clearly the best. Why? It provided the viewing audience with the idea that black folks can live the American Dream, no matter how deferred. Unfortunately, it is this cultural mythmaking that gives the idea that black folks must leave their "" 'hoods"" to be  successful. Also, unfortunately, this final season did not let the theme of ""ghetto-blacks"" die as evidence in contemporary comedies and movies.

All this to say, the acting and writing in this final season are top-quality. The actors and scenes will take you back and, for those who were not there to view it before reruns, it will make you feel like you should have been born earlier. Most of all, pay attention to the theme song...it is still applicable today. So, the themes of ""Good Times"" are still relevant. Thus, the show is a must-see. The season is a must-buy.",1154563200,,1064,4.7405405405405405
8126204,5,B000FSMEBA,excellent show about life for black people in america now they erased it as if black people are not poor like this anymore you can erase truth black people still live like this you put the season on without the father no strong black man thats not good business only shows that make black men look weak which is far from the truth now all the networks don't carry good times but all the shows where you make black people look like they are dumb and no direction this place is done the fall has begun,1520985600,,499,4.208333333333333
8126205,5,B000FSMEBA,"Has there ever been a show quite like Good Times? I don't knowbut as I grew up I watched with fixed wonder at a life that I didn't know, that life of a black family of five living in the ghetto constantly struggling to survive. But I recognized something there, something profound, and it wasn't just their love for each other; it was their faith and their perseverance, their being moral (okay, maybe not JJ all of the time) in the face of situations which would snap other peoples backs and reduce them to their lowest forms. This attracted me to the Evans family and I admired them all the more for it, and I felt like I got to know them. I lost track of them prior to their final season, only seeing shows here and there. Now Ive seen them all and while I bemoaned the loss of dad and the absence of mom for awhile I was happy to see Florida return at the beginning of this season. Willona was always a default member of the family, a second mother to the kids, and her struggles to ensure that her adopted daughter Penny (a young Janet Jackson!) always played well in this tough-minded show. JJ had been the man of the house but he stepped down this season when Flo returned to her roost and Thelma marrying her beau Keith expanded the family further as did Boogers buffalo butt! As always, each episode presented some hope raised and then that hope dashed, and we got to see how the household members managed each small shake and the larger potential devastations. They always persevered. They always loved. And they always stayed true to a moral foundation that found dignity in people especially as people recognized God (though there was less emphasis on this during this final season).

This show stands the test of time. I show it to teenage youth that I work with. I plan on showing it to my children when they get older. The Evans family became a part of my heart long before The Cosby Show ever aired. And they're still there.",1512864000,,1940,4.418994413407821
8126206,5,B000FSMEBA,"Great/cool season... I remembered I was only 6 six years old when this (final) season was aired on CBS and I also remembered (in early 1980) when the entire series began to air on syndication on one of our local independent stations in NY.  However, I do have a few concerns though... I've been wondering how this show would've turned out if the James Evans Sr. character was still on the show during seasons 4 through final season?.  Would J.J. actually have a job at the advertising agency during the 5th season?  Would Willona adopt Penny... would young Janet Jackson even join the cast at all??  Would Bookman (officially) join the cast in the 5th season?  Would J.J.'s friends (Poppo, Head, Cool Breeze) visit the Evans' apartment from time to time during the 5th season?  Would Thelma get married to Keith in the final season... would Keith even join the cast at all??",1502582400,,874,4.6797385620915035
8126207,3,B000FSMEBA,"The sixth season was the final season for ""Good Times"" which ended on a positive note. The series began with the first African American nuclear family with a father James Evans Sr. (John Amos); Florida Evans (Estelle Rolle) from ""Maude;"" and their three children with Jimmie Walker as J.J.; Bern Nadette Stanis as Thelma and Ralph Carter as Michael. Neighbor Willona (Ja'Net Dubois) is a family friend and frequent visitor. Thelma is married and her husband has moved into their project apartment.

The sixth and final season ended on a positive notes. Esther Rolle returned to the role of Florida Evans, a God-fearing matriarch of the Evans family, to her Chicago home. Her absence was definitely felt in the previous season. Esther Rolle and John Amos and the cast fought for the series to represent African Americans living in the Chicago projects. Rolle and Amos didn't like the direction of the series. They were absolutely right in standing up for the series even if it meant their absence. The death of James Evans Sr. was a tremendous mistake in television history. The series was never the same after his death. The last three seasons could never measure the first three seasons with the Evans family intact. We could only wonder what might have been if John Amos had resolved and stayed for the entire series.

""Good Times"" always had good times despite their hardships. As viewers, we admired the characters' struggles over obstacles in their lives. We can enjoy the final season now. I'm grateful for the ability to own the entire series on DVD. Sadly, this DVD doesn't feature any extra special features except the entire season on DVD.",1496102400,,1649,4.885714285714286
