8695012,1,B00RDEIW24,"I've never written a review for any movie, but I feel I must say to anyone thinking of purchasing this DVD or watching this movie:  Don't!  I can't believe grown people actually took time out of their lives to make this horrible, disgusting excuse of so called entertainment.  Approximately 108 minutes of my life wasted that I will never get back.",1467763200,,348,4.672131147540983
8695013,5,B00RDEIW24,"Bought the Movie, thought it was Hysterical. It's a light hearted, Silly, Romantic Comedy. The Blonde Girl who plays the lead is very sexy!! The whole movie has some funny parts in it, especially that nut who pulls the Rickshaw!! That guy Cracks me up!!!",1451606400,,254,4.666666666666667

8695015,1,B00RDEIW24,The negative reviews were right.  This was a complete waste of time & money.  Don't waste your time on this.,1432944000,,108,4.35
8695016,1,B00RDEIW24,"Not a good movie. One scene three guys come out of a bar and all three of them
throw up on this women's car parked in
front of this bar. Not a pleasant site. The girl in the movie who wants a career in
singing is not what I expected. Didn't keep
my interest. This movie didn't impress me at all. It is only worth a one time viewing that's all. Save your money.",1425600000,,360,3.8783783783783785
