8530303,5,B008TYWO8U,"They say that the hardest thing to do in sports is to win a second champion. Well Villopoto had tons of momentum after having won every championship he competed for  the year prior. He is fast, smooth with throttle delivery, and relentless in his catch and pass riding style. It's hard to fathom but, as an amateur, Villopoto could not beat Mike Allesi. But, these are the things that make a champion; for example, Michael Jordan being cut from the basketball team in high school. For us average people, we see it in terms of,  ""Well at least I tried."", the greats see it as a training aid or a benchmark.  Can you imagine how much it has to suck for Alessi to know he once dominated Villopoto and everyone else he lined up with, only to now see Ryan Villopoto become a living legend.",1410998400,,784,4.393103448275862
