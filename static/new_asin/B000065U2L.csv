7961436,3,B000065U2L,"Not quite as engaging as I had hoped for, but I loved both of these classic 60's shows and was eager to learn some behind-the-scenes info.  Many of the adult stars have now passed on. However, some of the child players  (such as Eddie Munster, Wednesday Addams) provide very interesting commentary.  Prompts some nice memories.  But to be honest this was only about a 3 1/2 star production.",1387584000,,390,4.6911764705882355
7961437,3,B000065U2L,"This documentary really didn't grab me like I hoped it would. The interviews with surviving cast members from both shows were shallow. And most of the narrative wasn't anything you haven't heard before. But according to this documentary the reasons both shows were cancelled, are you ready for this? Here comes the SPOILER. Read at your own risk. Because the networks wanted their respective shows to start filming in color and the studios couldn't afford to do so. Other VHSs You may want to consider are The Addams Family and Friends, The Munsters: The Lost Episodes which is a documentary, or Addams vs Munster Family fued which combines the first two mentioned on one tape.",1346457600,,677,4.895652173913043
