6358712,5,B00JHH202I,"This was a great mystery; I loved every minute of it. Right from the start the action took off and carried me right along with it. Part of what made this a great movie was the twists in the mystery; they kept me guessing. The other part I liked were the flashbacks ""Sunday"" had that revealed a little more about the main characters and more about the perpetuator's motive. All in all, this was a successfully written story, and if you love a movie with suspense, humor and a little romance, then this is the movie for you.",1412380800,12,522,4.336734693877551

6358720,1,B00JHH202I,"This is an odd movie that I regret purchasing. I'm still trying to figure out how this got such rave reviews. The couple hardly cares that their parents were kidnapped, which disconnects the audience from the central conflict. Additionally, the pretentious leads have unconvincing chemistry; she chooses to continually chastise his playful behavior rather than engage and be flirtatious. This movie lacks the qualities that make a story admirable. I shut it off after about 50 minutes.",1480118400,4,485,5.311688311688312

The director must have told the lead actors to open there eyes as wide as possible to make the appealing. Yuck!  They looked like they had had their pupils dilated.

6358764,4,B00JHH202I,"My Gal Sunday, inspired by Mary Higgins Clark's same-titled book of short stories, is a Hallmark production that crams a lot of stuff in a 90-minute television movie and expects you to keep up, and I like that. In some ways it topsy-turvies the conventions of the mystery genre. There's a male and female duo, but it's the woman who takes the lead. There's the opening sequence that, in other whodunits, is ordinarily reserved for the drawing room denouement. The pace isn't leisurely. Pertinent character background is casually lobbed at you during conversations. It feels like you just stepped into a story that had been going on for a few chapters already. And I like that too. Plenty of real life is about playing catch-up.

Are they perhaps too good to be true? Sure. But play along, anyway. She's a celebrated attorney. He's an ex-Secretary of State and -governor. Sandra ""Sunday"" O'Brien-Parker (Rachel Blanchard) and Henry Parker (Cameron Mathison) are about to embark on their first year anniversary, but, before that, enthused crime solvers that they are - and there's a ***SPOILER*** in the rest of this paragraph - they're inviting some guests to their home for a luncheon featuring Sunday's signature souffle... and also  to corner a murderer. Yeah, this movie presents a whirlwind opening act. Somewhere, Nick and Nora Charles are beaming.

But that bit of business is just the side show. For Sunday and Henry, things get very personal when their parents are abducted by a vengeful man who demands that an infamous assassin be released from federal prison. Except the kidnapper hadn't figured on the couple's political swagger and, more importantly, on Sunday's moxie and resourcefulness and life-long training on many things skullduggery from her Secret Service dad (soap star Jack Wagner). By the way, in a film rife with some pretty outrageous stuff, the thing that convinced me the least is that Jack Wagner is playing Blanchard's dad. To me, he just doesn't look old enough. That is some good living, Jack Wagner.

If Hallmark had intended this to be a potential back-door pilot for a primetime series, I say it worked. After watching this movie, I'm rarin' for further adventures with Sunday and Henry. Cameron Mathison has personality and charm in spades, and I'd observed this in his other Hallmark pictures (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Christmas-Ornament/dp/B00LOCLBWO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Christmas Ornament</a>, Along Came A Nanny). But it's Rachel Blanchard who drives the narrative. The counselor is a self-possessed go-getter and seems the more capable of the two in the ways of criminal detection. I had fun watching the interplay between Blanchard and Mathison. Sure, there are disjointed moments because this sucker moves at a hectic pace. Maybe they should've slowed down some to let a few scenes breathe. But I didn't mind the fast ride, and I can totally see an upscale mystery series about them in the vein of Hart to Hart or Tommy & Tuppence.",1415404800,11,3034,5.198364008179959
