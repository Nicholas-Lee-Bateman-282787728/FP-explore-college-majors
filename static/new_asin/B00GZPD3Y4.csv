6125050,3,B00GZPD3Y4,"Enemies Closer opens with a drug plane crashing in a lake on an island on the US/Canadian border. The cartel that the drugs belong to sends Xander (Jean Claude Van Damme) and his henchmen to island that the lake is apart of to retrieve them. They run into two people on the island who at first they must eliminate as witnesses and later must capture as they become pivotal to completing the mission.

Tom Everett Scott and Orlando Jones play the two people still on the island and as an added twist, they play two people who are trying to kill each other on the island when the cartel tries to kill them both, forcing them to work together. Scott plays Henry; an ex-Navy SEAL who became a Forrest Ranger on the island, which is also a nature preserve, after a mission in Afghanistan went bad and he lost a friend. Jones plays Clay; the ex-con brother of the man Henry lost who sneaked onto the island to kill Henry in revenge. They are in the middle of their own battle when Xander and his guys stumble across them.

Jones is fine as the disgruntled brother but Scott is badly miscast as Henry. Henry is supposed to be this bad ass Navy SEAL, but their is just something completely wimpish about the way Scott plays the role. It doesn't help that Henry gets beaten up several times during the movie, despite being an ex-Navy SEAL commander. Van Damme just kills as the bad guy in the movie. He's a drug runner with crazy hair and a vegan environmentalist outlook.

The story is good enough though the action is weak, unless its JCVD fighting. Van Damme just dives right into the ridiculousness of the character, even killing someone in the movie for doing something that harms the environment. Its an all time classic performance especially if your a fan of his. The movie goes downhill anytime Scott has to act like an action hero cause he's just not believable and it has a really cheesy scene where an old man decides to pull a Butch and Sundance. The ending is good and even gives Van Damme the best moment of the movie to ham it up. A step below Van Damme's more recent straight to DVD movies (Universal Soldier Regeneration, JCVD etc.) but still an good movie to watch.

The movie lost a star because of some weak action scenes as well as Scott's bad performance but more importantly, it lost another star because of the horrible video quality of the stream. The movie couldn't go one minute without pausing and at one point it was happening every other second. I hit paused and waited a half hour to let the movie download more but it didn't work either and it just kept happening. It was annoying but eventually I learned to deal with it. But it turned a movie that was about 80 minutes long into a two and a half hour long movie. It was so bad Amazon gave me a refund because of the bad quality.",1390953600,3,2804,4.4073359073359075
6125051,5,B00GZPD3Y4,"ENEMIES CLOSER is  a hideously fun action flick.  Van Damme has reinvented himself as a terrific if not over-the-top character actor.  He makes a great villain, both here and in the Expendables 2.  Tom Everett Scott and Orlando Jones hold their own as the two enemies turned allies. Bear in mind, there is a camp factor here.  If you enjoy very serious and realistic films that take themselves, well, seriously, this one may be a pass for you.  However, if you like lots of violence, catchy one-liners, B movies and things that are awesome, check this one out.",1390780800,,560,4.663265306122449
6125052,3,B00GZPD3Y4,"Finally watched this. I enjoyed it. The highlight is easily JC's performance, which is one of his best in my opinion. His villain is so wacky and over the top...almost like he was channeling Klaus Kinski or something. Another plus the movie had going for it was the pacing. Once it gets going, it doesn't slow down at all. It almost goes by too fast since it's only 85 minutes. Something I was kind of surprised with was how much JC was actually in it. I mean, this felt like a Van Damme movie! Not just a minute of screen time here and there. He 100% felt like the lead to me. I didn't mind Tom Everett Scott at all. Yeah, his character was a bit of a pussy and he isn't the first actor you would think of for an action role but it was just nice seeing a familiar Hollywood face...and acting wise, I thought he was fine. I would take him as a co star any day of the week over a Randy Couture type. Same goes for Orlando Jones. Everyone else, with the exception of the old guy that lived in the cabin, is a typical generic JCVD direct-to-video co star.

Production wise, I really liked the night time shooting. It hid the tiny budget pretty damn well and it just looked cool in general, I thought. The movie did have a few flaws that were annoying. For starters, Kris Van Varenberg was completely miscast and unconvincing as usual and every time that Linzey Cocker opened her mouth I wanted to hang myself! Also, some of the doubling was overly visible in some shots which is always irritating.

Overall, it may have been a bit of a let down considering that Peter Hyams gave us two of JC's best, but Enemies Closer is still WORLDS better than most other recent JCVD movies. It's a fun little action flick and I could easily re-watch it. 3.25/5",1390694400,12,1744,4.297872340425532

Meanwhile Xander (Jean-Claude Van Damme) a cheese eating vegan drug dealer is looking for a shipment of heroin that was dropped in the bay near the shore of the island. Clay and Henry are forced to team together etc. etc.

This was a very predictable, badly scripted, poor dialogue film. The title is from the expression, ""you keep your friends close and enemies closer"" or in this case there are no friends just one enemy closer than the other enemies. Van Damme has an early fight scene, but his close-ups after that include eating fruits and berries.

Not even worth viewing. Better action films out there.

Despite this the film's storyline is a bit week and strained, Van Damme looks terribly old in this film and he's a bad guy, which is not his best character work. Half the movie Van Damme is dressed in a Canadian Mount Police uniform which is just stupid.

It's nice to still see Van Damme in a movie, however, and the cinematography is always nice. The film does have a bit of a lower budget feel, but not enough to pan it. So, it's mixed with both good and bad attributes.",1434240000,,644,4.235772357723577

6125082,3,B00GZPD3Y4,"Enemies Closer is probably one of the best among the recent Jean-Claude Van Damme action films, but not for the reasons you may expect. This is a low-budget action film and most action scenes take place at night, which means the image is sometimes so dark that you just cannot see what is going on clearly. Also, unlike in The Expendables 2 you don't see much about what Van Damme can do as an action star.

What is the most impressive about Enemies Closer is that Jean-Claude Van Damme plays an eccentric knife-wielding villain named Xander, leader of criminals trying to retrieve a drug shipment that went down into the bottom of a lake near the American/Canadian border. Watching eccentric Xander delivering eco-related lies is fun.

So, it is Tom Everett Scott who is the hero of the film, as the good guy with the past, trying to stop Xander and other mercenaries. Orlando Jones plays Clay, who arrives at the lake to confront Tom Everett Scotts hero for the totally different reason than Xanders.

The film is directed by Peter Hyams, responsible for two of enjoyable Jean-Claude Van Damme films in 1990s, Timecop and Sudden Death. Their latest collaboration is not as good as they are, but still entertaining.",1421280000,,1216,4.780952380952381

6125091,3,B00GZPD3Y4,"I've grown up watching an enjoying Van Damme, since he burst on the screen with Kickboxer.  True, his acting and the movie storylines are never as good as his incredible physique and flexibility.  Nonetheless he leaves his mark upon the 80s and 90s as a solid martial artist and action star.

This movie, like The Expendables II, places Van Damme in a very different role of antagonist - and this may be hard for groupies to swallow, given his generally likable and boyish character.  But here we see a crazy, disheveled and nearly maniacal villain, which I found quite well portrayed.  His fighting skills are style excellent and he has incorporated the modern MMA phenomenon into various scenes also.

The difficulty with Van Damme being the ""bad guy"" in a movie, is you so want him to be the good guy.  And in this movie, he is clearly the better actor, and the protagonist barely on par with soap opera material.  The storyline is fairly clear and easy to follow, but there does remain an interesting twist which I will not spoil for you.

Nice job utilizing the Canadian border weakness.

Van Damme is a hilariously scary villain.  With his animated way of speaking, old grandma hairstyle, and ruthless violence, he rules.

The fight scenes are choreographed well, with interesting close combat brutality, MMA moves, and odd settings integrated.  Very realistic and exciting.  There is one fight in the forest that turns Planet of the Apes real fast!  Scary for our hero.

The sore point is that a few of the minor actors need more experience.  But Van Damme and his two opponents are excellent actors.

6125099,4,B00GZPD3Y4,"While his son John has been contributing to Jean-Claude Van Damme's career for the last few years, Peter Hyam has been making fewer and fewer movies in the new millennium, with his output becoming noticeably meager shortly after directing Van Damme during the height of his mainstream fame. Quite unexpectedly, Hyam Sr. now joins Van Damme in the rungs of low budget filmmaking, making his direct-to-video debut with a surprisingly cool movie. ""Enemies Closer"" is not a conventional JCVD vehicle, but it is a pretty effective action-adventure outing that's definitely better than many may have expected.

The story: a soldier-turned-park ranger (Tom Scott,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/An-American-Werewolf-in-Paris/dp/155890848X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">An American Werewolf in Paris</a>) is confronted by an ex-con seeking deadly retribution for a past wrong (Orlando Jones,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evolution/dp/B00005R874/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evolution</a>). At the same time, a team of drug runners led by a madman (Van Damme) seek a lost load of heroin. When the two groups collide, enemies will have to become allies to survive the night.

I'm not going to talk about anyone else's dramatic performance, because it's fair to say that Van Damme blows everyone else in the movie out of the water in this field. Van Damme, the guy who critics still say can't act, is nothing short of mesmerizing here. The combination of a script that really panders to his character and Jean-Claude's untethered enthusiasm makes for easily his most memorable performance since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/JCVD/dp/B001PWY4NG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">JCVD</a>, and sees him finally throwing off the dark-and-brooding persona he's portrayed for the last ten movies or so just to have a ball playing a murderous nutcase. ""Xander"" espouses vegan philosophy and always has time for nature, freely switches between French and English, laughs gleefully in the face of impending explosions, and does weird things like killing people with CD shards. This is the kind of villainous role that you might expect his cohort Dolph Lundgren to play, but Jean-Claude excels regardless of expectations. If he can deliver half of this level of energy in his future films, it'll be worth becoming a fan all over again.

Now that I'm done gushing over the lead villain, know that the rest of the movie is pretty good, too. Veteran director Hyams makes the most of a small budget by setting the picture in a naturally aesthetic setting (the forest/lake area, convincingly looking like Canada) and focusing his resources on making the movie look as professional and decisively un-DTV as possible. He succeeds, too, save for a few unnecessary speed-ups of footage. The script is sound, albeit perhaps not as dramatic as it wants to be (see most of the scenes between Scott and Jones) and features at least couple physical feats that might be described as superhuman (e.g. walking on an impaled leg). The action content is ample, and appreciatively heavy on hand-to-hand fighting: there are maybe two or three shootouts and eleven brawls - the most fights seen in a Van Damme film since&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Quest/dp/0783226748/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Quest</a>. These matches are hit & miss, albeit heavier on the former, with little pure karate and more grappling, choreographed well enough. My favorite fight belongs not to Jean-Claude, but to Tom Scott and lead henchman Zahary Baharov (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Universal-Soldier-Regeneration/dp/B002U6CJCO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Universal Soldier: Regeneration</a>).

At a slim 85 minutes, this is also the shortest movie Van Damme has been in for a while, but this allows it to be pretty streamlined and to-the-point, with next to no superfluous scenes beyond some character-establishing ones. There's a decent amount of gore, no doubt due to After Dark Films' roots in the horror genre, but not enough to put off the squeamish.

""Enemies Closer"" is a good example of the creativity offered by the DTV genre. There is no way that Jean-Claude Van Damme would have made this film during his mainstream career, so it's cool that he's using the relative freedom of lower budgets to play new roles. And regardless of whether Peter Hyams is able to return to Hollywood features, it's good to know that he can definitely hold his own on the non-cinematic circuit.

6125107,1,B00GZPD3Y4,"With After Dark Films as a production coordinator you immediately know you're in for cheap and then when we have an opening scene in which an airplane flies over a lake and then suddenly dives prop first into it but looking like a model airplane making that final plunge, then you really know. Even the little splash of water looked like filming the after splash of dropping a rock into the lake.

JCVD, in case you hadn't figured it out, used a well made up stunt double for what ever was suppose to be action, but was so poorly choreographed I would have preferred watching kids wrestling in the yard.

Acting (dare I say that) with a robotic and not believable max of 13 words a line between cuts. The dialogue had that written by high schoolers quality for all the dumb juvenile level tripe exchanged. OK, you want proof they may not be actors. Practically everyone associated had in their resumes - all TV spots, TV series, TV movies with - fine - a few movies entitled, ""Mars Needs Moms"", ""Clash of the Santas"", ""Rabbit Fever"".

Storyline is about drugs being flown between Canada and the US but filmed mostly in Bulgaria (3/4ths of the people associated, including JDVDs personal chef & driver, had last names ending in ""ev"" or ""ov"").

6125116,4,B00GZPD3Y4,"Director Peter Hyams is responsible for some of my most guilty pleasures when it comes to movies.  Ive enjoyed many of his films over the years, including OUTLAND with Sean Connery, 2010, TIMECOP, THE RELIC, and A SOUND OF THUNDER.  So when I heard he was teaming up with Jean-Claude Van Damme again for this film, I couldn't wait to see it.  And sure enough, Hyams once again does not disappoint.  ENEMIES CLOSER is a fast-paced thriller that is full of dark humor and intense action.

As an 80s teen, I am so glad to see Van Damme back onscreen.  Granted, hes older, but its still fun seeing him in action, much like seeing Stallone and Schwarzenegger.  These action icons may age, but they can still kick ass!

ENEMIES CLOSER is shot well and looks great onscreen.  There are not many special effects, but we do get some nice gore when homemade traps kill a couple of unsuspecting bandits.  The sets look superb, and I am particularly impressed with how the production team made their Louisiana filming location look like the U.S./Canadian border.

The acting is pretty good, about what you would expect from an action flick.  Tom Everett Scott actually does a good job with this serious role (I expect tongue-in-cheek performances from him for the most part, but he does not go that route here), as does Orlando Jones.  Jones surprised me, for Ive only seen him do comedyseeing him in such a dark persona is a nice change of pace.  But Van Damme steals the show as the poofy-haired, psychotic leader of the drug bandits.  Ive never seen him in a role like this, but he pulls it off with ease.  With a bit of pitch humor and a nice dose of crazy, Van Damme gives us a perfect villain.

Nowfor as much as I liked this film, ENEMIES CLOSER does have a couple of issues.  These aren't flaws with the film itself, but more like things that annoyed me from a personal standpoint.  For example, I am still confused as to why Tom Everett Scott was cast as an ex-Navy SEAL, not to mention why his character is such a wuss in the fight scenes.  I mean, a SEAL should be able to take down an assailant who has no military training fairly easily, I would thinkright?  My other complaint is how some parts of the fight scenes were shot with shadows, so as to disguise Van Dammes stunt double.  I know, I knowhe IS older, like I mentionedbut this aspect made ME feel old.

Still, don't take my griping as a reason not to see this film.  I recommend giving this one a shot, especially if you're a child of 80s culture like me.  In addition to taking a trip down memory lane, you might just gain new respect for an aging action veteran and his continuing career.  ENEMIES CLOSER is available today in a variety of formats.",1394496000,7,2710,4.446247464503043

6125119,3,B00GZPD3Y4,"I kinda wish I had waited till it came out on Netflix and didn't waste 7 dollars.

I chose 3 because it was just okay... The writing was less than stellar (cheesy lines and undeveloped characters) and the plot was also very thin and not really that believable.

I liked the main actors though, Henry (Tom Scott), Xander (Van Damme) and Clay (Orlando Jones) and I love Van Damme movies, but unfortunately this one just came off as ""B"" movie. Not that you would expect a stimulating plot from a Van Damme movie but I've seen better from him.

This movie would have been 4-5 stars back in the 80's and early 90's

*semi-spoiler -
The thing I hated most about the movie was when Henry and Clay first met it seemed very forced. It was a good idea, but the script was just poorly executed. It must have been very hard to act in it and make it something better than the script deserved.

The actors give it 1 star.

The fact that it's a Van Damme movie gave it 1 star.

And lastly I have to say that Van Damme's hair and the last line of Van Damme gave it a third star for a total of 3 stars.

6125124,2,B00GZPD3Y4,"Enemies Closer(released in Dec/13)stars among others,Jean-Claude Van Damme,Tom Everett Scott,Orlando Jones,Kristopher Van Varenberg and Linzey Cocker. Van Damme's ""epic split""commercial for Volvo was filmed while this was on the verge of being released. Mr. Van Damme has made some very decent films in recent times such as Wake of Death,JCVD,Six Bullets and Assassination Games. We also can't forget his appearance in The Expendables Two. He has also made some mediocre to bad films such as Derailed,Dragon Eyes,Second in Command and his worst,the two sequels to Universal Soldier,which continue to mutate into entities that no where near resemble the originals in any way ,shape or form. Having said that,will Mr. Van Damme's recent reinvigorated career courtesy of Volvo influence the parts and quality of films he is offered?....one can only hope.
The story here involves a ranger(Scott) on one Kings Island,somewhere just south of the US-Canadian border. Scott is an ex forces soldier/diver who has taken the lonely ranger job to straighten his mind out after his experiences over there. A plane,unbeknownst to the ranger, makes a death plunge into the water near the island. Then he is visited by Jones who is an ex con and brother to a soldier who got killed in Scott's platoon. His idea is to take revenge out on him for his brothers death. As Jones and Scott stand near the water's edge a bright light from a boat shines on the pair. Behind the light is Xander(Van Damme)and his posse,which includes his son Kris. The plane that came down was loaded with 50 bags of heroin and he is there to retrieve it.
Xander is a true psycho path and will stop at nothing,including killing his own men,to get the drugs. In the ensuing fire fight Xander's diver is killed,or more specifically is wounded and wasted by Xander because there's no chance of his survival. From here Scott and Jones must work together to survive Xander's wrath. It is a game of cat and mouse as each of Xander's men try and flush the two out. One by one Xander's men are whittled down. When two police show up Xander dispatches them himself by tracking them in the woods.
Jones and Scott end up in the only house on the island and the occupant there wants no part of giving up. He is in fact too gung ho to give it to Xander and his boys,and he ends up getting killed. The two barely escape that trap, and they lay a trap themselves to capture Xanders last man(Kris Van Varenberg) and get him. They beat a confession out of him as to Xander's reason for being there and his current status. Xander pulls one last trick out of his sleeve. He has as a hostage a girl whom Scott had arranged a date with that evening. Scott into surrenders and makes the dive for the heroin himself. When they go off Jones finds out the girl is actually working for Xander,when she dispatches two police who arrive by boat.
Scott dives and retrieves the heroin for Xander. But he also brings up an automatic weapon and now seems to have the upper hand as they head in to shore. Off the boat Jones has the girl hostage and she screams that Jones is going to kill her. The confusion in Scott gives Xander the chance he needs to escape after a brief fight. Jones wrestles and subdues the girl while Scott is able to grab onto the fleeing Xander's boat. In the ensuing struggle an anchor penetrates a fuel line which drains into the water. Scott is eventually forced overboard, but not before he is able to grab a flare. While he watches Xander's boat drive away he lights the flare and the gas leakage catches fire. Just before the boat blows into smithereens,Xander laughs wildly.
Back on shore Scott and Jones have made up and vow to forget their differences.
The plot is not quite as tight as it should have been. The introduction of the girl into the plot seems superfluous,as does Jone's inclusion. One without the other would have been fine,thank you very much. That scene where Scott floats in the water and lights the gas trail is pretty unrealistic. He would have had to have been at the very beginning of the gas trail in the water,otherwise the gas in front AND behind him would have ignited also. But considering the amount of time it leaked,he was no where near the beginning of it when he hit the water. Also the film leads off with Xander and his boys arriving at a DEA(?)office which monitored the crash of the plane. This introduces us to the character of Xander and his gang(dressed in Mountie suits,replete with horses.....?....seriously?), but it is also,totally unnecessary. We saw the plane go down,so keep us in suspense until later in the film when we find out from Xander himself what he and his posse are doing there. The fact that they all have horses and are dressed as Mounties is a stereotype gone mad. Unless this was set in the 1800s,which it wasn't,the RCMP today ride mostly in cars,thank you very much.
There is a major blooper. There is a shot of Xander patrolling the waters in his boat. As it goes from a close up to a long shot,we see the close shoreline he is cruising by. Watch for a car with headlights facing the camera,which suddenly makes a quick left just before the picture cuts to the next scene. Sloppy. One thing I did see that I liked is Jean's son Kris. His acting chops are getting better every time I see him. Keep up the good work!
Technically speaking the film is in its w/s a/r of 2:35:1 and is clear and crisp. Like most other Van Damme films,there are no extras. This has always been a bug a boo with me. C'mon Jean Claude,let's give out with an interview or two,eh?
All in all ,not what I was hoping for. The plot is unnecessarily complicated and clunky,which weighs the film down when it could have been light,trim and faster on the draw. JCVD's portrayal of Xander was good,but given the aforementioned weaknesses,it's impact was greatly diminished. I am certainly hoping Mr Van Damme's new found status gets him some high priced help in the movie department. He HAS made some good films in recent years,but the majority are,sadly,less than stellar efforts. What Mr. Van Damme himself said about his drug problems, can also be related to his film work of late:he has hooked up with film crews/companies that may be good,but are NOT good for him. And Jean Calude,that hair piece you are wearing of late?.......awful buddy,get rid of it. 2 1/2 -3 stars.",1392336000,,6362,4.621024734982332

6125127,3,B00GZPD3Y4,"""Nothings gonna stop this thing, you hear me."" Henry (Scott) is a former Navy Seal who is working as a forest ranger on the US/Canadian border. When a drug cartel led by Xander (Van Damme) shows up they want help finding their drug shipment that has gone missing. At the same time someone connected to Henry's past shows up with a grudge against him looking for revenge. This is a hard movie to review. It is a Van Damme movie so you know what to expect even though this is a little different then most of his recent films. The big difference in this is that he is a bad guy. I think its because of his age but the action sequences in his new movies aren't nearly as cool as they used to be. The movie itself though isn't that terrible and in terms of B movies its OK. The most interesting aspect is between Henry and the man who threatens him. Its pretty predictable but in a Van Damme movie that is expected. Overall, Van Damme fans will like this, everyone else may enjoy it. I expected worse. I give this a C+",1391385600,,1013,4.2
