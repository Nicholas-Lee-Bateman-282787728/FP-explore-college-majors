641309,5,6303415326,"This video totally displays the life of a real wrestling heavyweight champion.  The #1 athlete of the 20th century.  It goes back to the days when he won his first title, to great bouts with Steamboat and Vader, even to his near career-ending plane accident.  A lot of good interviews with the Nature Boy, but it does not give the great anecdotes he would say during his days with the NWA, WWF and WCW.  One quote says it best about the Nature Boy, ""Often imitated, never duplicated!!!"" WOOOO!  END",897782400,,498,4.550561797752809
7846175,2,6303415326,Good interviews and good clips.  The featured matches were not shown in their entirety and the Rude v. Flair and Vader v. Flair in the Thundercage that was promised were not shown at all.... very disapointing.,1164931200,,209,4.805555555555555
7846176,5,6303415326,"In the world that existed before DVD's, this tape was about as good as it gets.  This tape features Flair at his peak.  He speaks candidly about such topics as the plane crash very early in his career, which almost ended his career.  He also talks about his training under Verne Gagne.  Unlike Hulk Hogan, who had his career on mainstream television for the most part, Ric Flair's career was viewed mostly by the cable audience.  For many people, much of this tape will be previously unseen footage of his bouts.

It is a great chance to see or hear such legends as the American Dream Dusty Rhodes, Ravishing Rick Rude, Harley Race, Vader, Sting, Muta and the Four Horseman (the greatest assemblage of wrestling talent ever to unite).  Ric Flair's career spans 2 decades of legendary bouts and superstar opponents.  This tape does an excellent job of summarizing and showcasing all of it.

Of course, now the WWE has come out with a multi-disc package of Ric Flair, including video of him in the NWA, WCW and WWF/E.  Even still, I highly recommend this tape.",1139961600,,1058,4.639784946236559
7846177,5,6303415326,"This is the greatest video ever, from magnificent streetfighter sound effects, to the action packed matches.  Gads, this movie is hot, if you are a Rick Flair fan, this film is a hellova good.  According to Craig...",1021248000,,215,4.783783783783784
7846178,5,6303415326,"This is a very good behind the scenes look at the life of the great ""Nature Boy"" Ric Flair.
The insight on this video of Flair is very good.
You get to hear and see things about Ric Flair that you may not have known before.
Get an up close and personal account of Flair's career from the man himself and from several other legends of the game.
A must have for every Ric Flair Fan.",1017014400,3,380,4.0131578947368425
7846179,4,6303415326,"Although released in the later part of 1995, this video was put together while Ric Flair was inactive from the sport (October 94 - April 95) and was basically a review of his career and how he came to be the most accomplished star in the industry.
There are some really good indepth interviews from both allies and rivals of Flair. Men such as Sting, Dusty and Dustin Rhodes, and Arn Anderson are interviewed throughout the tape and give some surprisingly interesting comments pertaining to the Nature Boy (Sting speaks of how he felt the first time he faced Flair and Dustin comments on watching his dad and Flair do battle in the ring).
In addition, ""the man"" himself speaks candidly about every aspect of his career - from the plane crash that almost ended his career before it began, to being trained by Verne Gagne, to his first title victory against Dusty Rhodes in St. Louis, to how he sees his future in the industry.
At the end of the tape, three of Flair's biggest title victories are shown (although not shown in their entirety). 1) vs. NWA Champion Harley Race (cage match from Starrcade 83 in Greensboro, NC) 2) vs. NWA Champion Ricky Steamboat (Wrestle War 89 in Nashville, TN) 3) vs. WCW Champion Big Van Vader (Starrcade 93 in Charlotte, NC)
Really good tape considering it runs only 60 minutes. The only thing I find missing is any footage of Flair being in the WWF (although considering this tape was made by WCW, I didn't expect that).
Recommended.",979084800,2,1467,4.624521072796935
