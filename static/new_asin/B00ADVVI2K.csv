8550291,3,B00ADVVI2K,"This movie takes place in a little seen period of history where big metal warships were still fairly new and Japan was considered a backwards, primitive nation. As a period film there can be no greater success than to capture the look and feel of an unexplored era. And this film manages that. Usually. Unfortunately the plot does not live up to the production. It's told in something of a docudrama style with constant narration to explain what's going on. This has the effect of confusing everybody (especially when it comes to remembering names) and removing any tension from the scenes. It tries very hard to be a roaring, patriotic adventure but it just can't seem to find its footing or any emotional core. The Japanese have tended to be rather understandably uncomfortable with gung-ho war films post-WW2, but this only partly accounts for the detatched attitude they approach the subject with here.

As a spectacle this film is stunning. It has a large amount of extras in authentic-looking costumes charging through ships and battlefields that look equally real. Even the effects are excellent, often a major failing on even big-budget Japanese productions. The acting is fairly good too, with Toshiro Mifune (always a pleasure) in the lead. But none of this is enough to make up for a lackluster script and poor-quality pacing. Quite a disappointment, but it may be worth checking out if you're interested in this kind of thing.",1362700800,2,1438,4.9421487603305785
