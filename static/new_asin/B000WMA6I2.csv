2983520,5,B000WMA6I2,"I skipped this when it came out, not realizing that it contained two of Lincoln Perry's performances, as Stepin Fetchit. Perry was one of the most brilliant comics of his time, and has been unfairly maligned because of a cultural misinterpretation of his great creation, Stepin Fetchit. Perry was thoughtful and articulate, but his Fetchit character, based on someone Perry judged to be the world's laziest man, was a comic exaggeration taken to surreal levels. Basically, Perry, billed as Stepin Fetchit, played the same character in every film. It's a knife-edge gag, however, because it can be taken as a demeaning stereotype of African-Americans or, as Perry intended, a lovable comic foil he could mine for surprising and clever comic bits. It made him an inveterate scene-stealer, acknowledged as such by some of Hollywood's leading actors, and it is remarkable to watch him interact with Will Rogers. Perry said he and Rogers would just get a sense of the script and then cut loose during the take. There are some cringe-inducing moments when that comedy teeters onto the wrong side of the knife (due mostly to the scripts), but Black audiences of the 30s understood the gag and rejected the idea of a stereotype. They could appreciate the comic genius of Perry's exaggerations; the more popular his movies, the more popular he became with live audiences on the Black theater circuit. It's nice to be able to see Perry's performances intact, especially in Judge Priest, one of his most extended roles.
  Interestingly, Perry was under studio contract, not a rogue comic hired for specific roles, and had mid-level billing (in the cast card, the leads were in large letters, the studio regulars in medium letters, and, lastly, the minor characters in small letters). However, he and Hattie McDaniel, in medium letters, were listed at the end of the cast card - the back of the bus, you might say.

2983523,4,B000WMA6I2,"This early John Ford film starring Will Rogers in the title role is agreeable, satisfying, and entertaining. ""Doc Bull"" is the only physician in a small Connecticut town, on call at all times, beginning to feel his age, and trying hard to keep up with progress in medicine. He is a widower whose friendship with a local widow provides grist for town gossips. A typhoid outbreak tests him and the town.

The first reason to watch the film is to see the fine performance by Rogers, amusing at some times, poignant in others.

The second reason is to glimpse life in America in the 1930s. Doctors made house calls. Mail came by train. Telephone operators connected every call by hand, and from listening to the conversations knew everything that went on. (In one scene, Rogers has a fine rant against the telephone. It sounds just like our generation cursing the blackberry.)

There's a social issue in the film. In the 1930s many Americans still put a great emphasis on a family's ""stock"" (its origins), and the older generation wanted to match young adults only with proper and approved mates of the same religion and class. Dr. Bull has a more liberal view. Perhaps this was one of the movies that helped move America toward its socially more democratic future.

8223734,5,B000WMA6I2,"These DVD's arrived on time and I've really enjoyed them all. The Will Rogers movie, Dr. Bull , is hard to find. That was really the movie I wanted, but the others were all very good as well.",1493942400,,191,4.052631578947368
8223735,4,B000WMA6I2,"The word""comedies""on this set is misleading. We have three films with Will Rogers,that by themselves can only be considered ""comedies""in the broadest sense. Rogers usually played the down home ,aww shucks,common sense-type with homespun humour and wit mixed in,no matter what his character's on screen profession was. A Stan Laurel or Buster Keaton he was not,nor did he try to be. A situation comedy might be a little closer to the truth, but even then the label doesn't entirely stick with Will Rogers. Two of the other three are dramas that just happen to have humour in their scripts. There is really only one that I would consider a comedy,but Ford manages to even louse that up.
""When Willie comes Marching Home""(released Feb/50)stars,among others,Dan Dailey and Corinne Calvet. Dailey enlists,anxious to go to war. He's given a huge sendoff. However before you know it he's based just outside of his hometown. He cannot get a transfer for love nor money ,as he is vital as a trainer. Eventually a few months before wars end he finally gets a chance to go overseas and flies out on a B17. However he is forced to ditch over France and the Maquis get him. They film a V2rocket launch and they send him back to England. with the proofFrom there he heads to the States ad is grilled to exhaustion. He's mistakenly sent to a mental ward. He busts out of there and heads home. There the Government catches up to him and instead of court martial-ling him, they decorate him. The plot here goes from average to poor within a 1/2 hour,and we get as much annoyed with it as Dailey gets about his ridiculous situation. What is supposed to be funny really isn't. Lots of guys got stuck doing things they didn't want during the War and it was frustrating,not funny. And that real frustration is in abundance here. How Ford expected to rise above it is beyond me. He didn't, and thats why it gets just 2 -2 1/2 stars. Extras include deleted scenes,the trailer and pic galleries.
This is a double sided disc and on the flip side we have""Up the River""(released Oct/30)which stars,among others,Spencer Tracy and Humphrey Bogart. These two are cons in the big house. Just before Bogart is set to leave he falls for a female inmate(different set up from today!).They agree to see each other after she gets out. Bogart heads for home when he gets out. However he is followed there by his girlfriends ex boss, who wants to make it tough for him unless he starts working for him. Tracy and another con break out to fix the crook who is putting the squeeze on Bogie, so when his girl gets out he can live life hassle free. After they do,back they return to the prison and return like conquering heroes. This film has more than a slight resemblance to the a concurrent gangster hit The Big House. However what makes it different is the ability of Tracy and friend to  come and go outside the prison when they want. When Tracy says he's going,he's going. That is about the only light part of this film. It's an absurdity that Ford tries to make light of but unfortunately gets minimal laughs with. What is important to me about this film is its soon to be superstar cast of Bogart and Tracy. Tracy especially is totally up front and confident in this role and at such an early juncture in his career. 2 1/2-3 stars. Extras are just a stills gallery.
What Price Glory(released July/52)stars,among others James Cagney,Corinne Calvet, and Dan Dailey. It's WW1 and Dailey is one heck of a drill sergeant,while Cagney is loudmouth captain. The two despise each other and resort to a strange style of fighting,as each draw a cross on the floor then go at it. When the captain finally gets Daily,he,as has been his way,rides him hard. What makes things even tougher is that both,while billeted in a French town for quite some time,fall for the same girl;and she falls for them. Through some drunken rages and fights the two finally have it out and plays cards to see who gets the girl;Cagney bluffs his win. The orders come to move out and Cagney moves out without getting the girl. Dailey could stay behind, but he also decides to follow Cagney as they march side by side towards battle. This is yet another film in this set that gets old very,very fast. The fact that the troop is billeted in this town for months on end does nothing to enhance the plot or its characters. All the yelling,fighting and other verbal skirmishing specifically gets weary fast. By the time the film ended,I didn't care whether who went,stayed,got the girl or what. Ford threw in what he could in the ""humour"" department, but after a while it all falls flat. There is even a scene where a young Robert Wagner gets killed and Cagney cries like a baby. Poignant and heartbreaking,but FAR from ""funny"".2- 2 1/2 stars. The trailer is included.
Doctor Bull(released Sept/33)stars,among others Will Rogers and Vera Allen. Rogers plays a small town doctor who has been at it for years. Maybe a bit too lackadaisical,he lets a typhoid outbreak get the better of him and he is removed from practicing. All the small town busy bodies and naysayers are in their glory. However the doctor keeps secretly treating a local boy who been paralyzed for many months. Eventually he is able to have him up walking again. This gives the boy his life back while saving his own. This is a fair to middling film, with Rogers playing in his usual comfort zone. 3 stars.
This is two sided disc,and it is backed with ""Judge Priest""(released Sept/34) and stars,among others,Will Rogers,Tom Brown and Henry B. Walthall and black stars Hattie McDaniel and Stepin Fetchit. Rogers plays a small town judge who's rival claims that a big case he is about to preside over should be given to another judge due to a conflict of interest. The ""conflict"" meaning his rival is the prosecution in the case and the two have never gotten along. Rogers removes himself from it. But since it involves the railroading of an innocent man Rogers doesn't totally let it go. It turns out it was a frame up all along. The defendant is a fellow who was quiet,kept to himself  and being ""different"" wrongly got people's suspicions up. In the end Rogers makes sure justice is done, whether he is on the bench or not. This film was a step up for Rogers who imbued his character here with more than the usual wit and humour, and even some pathos. 3-3 1/2 stars.
Finally there is ""Steamboat Round the Bend""(released Sept/35)starring,among others, Will Rogers and Anne Shirley. This time around Rogers buys an old wreck of a paddlwheeler and gets his nephew to help run it. However when said nephew shows up he has a wife in tow. Rogers learns that his nephew got into a tussle and killed a man in self defense while on his way there. While the wife isn't happy,Rogers persuades him to give himself up. Now Rogers has to find the only witness to the murder and that's The New Moses,an evangelical priest who sails up and down the river. It all comes down to the wire as Rogers gets the word to the hangman,via the Governor,just in time. This film also was a decent vehicle for Rogers and the film moves along pretty well. 3 1/2 stars. Extras include the trailer and commentary.
All the films listed above have good pictures. The worst film in this lot is ""Up the River"",for another reason. The picture jumps continually. Many conversations are interrupted and cut off. Maybe if the film wasn't in such poor shape it might be better to watch,as the pacing is knocked right off kilter throughout.
I cannot argue what awards Ford received during his long career,and for what. But I have always maintained he was an over rated director(sacrilege,I know!) and that his best works were with serious fare,NOT comedy of any kind. Sure,throw in humourous lines and situations when called for(Ford was good at building memorable characters,making them feel life like),but for God sakes, don't let him try and be funny. So for those who would call this set a ""comedy"" set,then I say he fell flat on his keester in his attempt. But to me it is not. A more knowledgeable director in pure comedy could have elevated Rogers films very easily. Ford's hands were too clumsy in that area and as a result his work was  pedestrian.
Having said all that,and considering the ratings of each of these films,I am still giving it  four stars. Just to have Rogers works available in this set is,to me,worth the price. The others are curiosities. Up the River,especially, having the distinction of being early examples of Bogie and Tracy's works. The other two you can use as fancy coasters. Ford's well earned rep rests in places other than in this set.",1484784000,,8624,4.645710543549443

8223737,5,B000WMA6I2,I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the dvds and the quality of the films themselves.  Will Rogers was a very charismatic actor who was down to earth and natural.  Despite the age of the films they are all very entertaining and worthwhile movies to watch over and over. The movies WITHOUT Will Rogers are not as interesting to watch although the director WAS John Ford.,1440288000,,378,4.626865671641791

8223740,4,B000WMA6I2,"'John Ford's American Comedies' is made up primarily of artifacts from Fox's early golden era ('Steamboat 'Round the Bend,' 'Dr. Bull,' 'Judge Priest' and 'Up the River') with a couple mildly entertaining wartime musical-dramedies from the '50s ('What Price Glory?' and 'When Willie Comes Marching Home') thrown in for the price.  The artifacts are the more interesting from an academic perspective, allowing those who aren't familiar with Will Rogers' film resume to get a feel for his homespun charm and (in the case of UTR) affording a unique chance to see Humphrey Bogart and Spencer Tracy sharing the screen.  But while the nostalgia factor is high, the humor in these four titles is pretty tepid and Ford wasn't utilizing much of the cinematic style that he had developed throughout his silent epics and which grew to legendary proportion in his later, better works (WPG? and WWCMH not being among them).  Four-disc set (two flippers, two single-sided picture discs) offers a few nice extras, including (truly rare) deleted scenes and commentary.  Prints are of variable-- though mostly good-- quality.  Movies combined average 3 stars; presentation pushes the package closer to 4.",1406332800,2,1187,5.226315789473684
8223741,5,B000WMA6I2,"John Ford shows his flawless instincts as he drops the reins and lets Will Rogers ""have his head"".  There is a delightful partnering of these two mega-talents in three films in which Rogers plays a Steamboat Captain, a Judge and a Doctor.  Treats and treasures are waiting here for those who can see beyond the black & white to a time when the qualities of respect and reverence, fidelity and friendship were well known.  The comedy is genuine and the laughter is generous.
Dan Dailey plays the part of a patriot who can't seem to get to the war.  The story is of a real life irony taken from a war hero's memoirs.  Dailey plays the part well and spontaneously.
""Up The River"" looks like it was saved just in time and thank goodness for that!  In this we see very early performances by Bogey and Spencer Tracy.  There are places where the odd small segment is missing but John Fords genius still shines through.  It certainly deserves a place in the collection.
""What Price Glory"" caught me by surprise but I will leave it at that.
The collection is certainly worth it!",1366675200,5,1069,4.5025906735751295
8223742,5,B000WMA6I2,"I'm late to the party on Will Rogers and no authority on his importance to American culture, though with even slight understanding it's evident how unbelievably popular he was in his time.  Aside from the giant shadow he must have cast, 2 of these films, Judge Priest and Dr. Bull are as pure a confluence of John Ford strengths and an actor's gifts (and screenwriter's wit) as there are in the John Ford canon.  Both are fantastic ruminations on times past, even as they were being produced, both romantic and harsh and world weary (The best Ford's are all these).  Will Rogers might be the original method actor.  Though surely he is working from brilliant scripts, his delivery has all the earmarks of being spoken for the first time without self-consciousness, improv must have been a huge component of it, and Ford lets him go.  He is charming, even while trying to be, and that's difficult to pull off.  It just comes to him.
It would be difficult also, not to mention Stepin Fetchit .........but one is almost speechless with his characterizations of a no account in Judge Priest.  It might seem sacrilege but you can't take your eyes off him while trying to fathom the depths that he goes to get there.  High art or high camp and unbelievably racist....it's all there.
The other films are worthy of mention also.
The Cagney piece, What Price Glory, is a great surprise.  Based on a play, set in World War 1 foxholes and bunkers and in color!  Strange and well done, not Ford per se but great Cagney.
The others have merit as well, must sees for Ford afficianados and the price is worth Priest & Bull so why not?  Only real problem is that the copy of Up The River is a butchered mess, chunks of it abruptly cut off, it's a shame but they must have done their best with the available print.  They probably shouldn't have included it or at they should have least mentioned it's sorry state it but it's still a lark to see Tracy in his first celluloid.
