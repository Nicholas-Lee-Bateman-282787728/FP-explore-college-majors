4709678,4,B005ION4VK,There is still a very good movie here when The Brothers Safdie let Cassavetes go for a little while and get great performances from adults and kids alike.  The nostalgia for childhood mixed with the reality of childhood makes for a touching storm.  I look forward to these very talented brothers getting more and more into their own voice.,1322524800,,339,4.728813559322034
4709679,3,B005ION4VK,"Sad tale of a father who loves his kids, gets custody for only two weeks a year, and fails miserably at being a father during those two weeks. He doesn't do anything to intentionally harm them or put them in danger but almost every choice he makes does so just because he is incapable of considering consequences or of putting their needs ahead of his own desires and impulses. The film proceeds along a low tech near-mumblecore path which suits the subject well.",1322092800,,463,4.590361445783133
4709680,5,B005ION4VK,"I first saw this film at a film festival in Tucson. This film has stuck with me since I saw it in November 2010 and I'm super excited to pre-order this film. The couple of other reviews already summarized the film pretty well. The film is semi-autobiographical. Bennie Safdie did a Q&A after the film screened and said that ""80% of the film is stuff that actually happened to us"" (meaning him and his brother).

I can't get enough of the Safdie brothers. If you like this film, be sure to check out The Pleasure of Being Robbed!",1320192000,2,528,4.387755102040816

Created by newcomer brothers Ben and Joshua Safdie, 'Daddy Longlegs' was shot on 16 millimeter and has the appearance of a film created in the late 70s (it seems like this is when the film is supposed to take place). It's up for the John Cassavettes Award as part of the independent cinema Spirit Awards in 2011 and reminds one of a Cassavettes film, shot in a cinema verite style, with partially a jazz score underneath. I recently heard the Safdies speak about the film in person and they indicated that it's loosely based on experiences with their father who divorced their mother years ago.

Daddy Longlegs is about a ne'er-do-well by the name of Lenny played by first-time actor Ronald Bronstein. Lenny is divorced from his wife and gets to spend two weeks out of the year with his 7 and 9 year old children, Sage and Frey (played by Sage and Frey Ranaldo in real life). Bronstein remained in character even when not on the set--for example when he visited Sage and Frey at their real school!

Daddy Longlegs is the portrait of a parent who obviously loves his children, but through his irresponsible behavior, ultimately places their lives in jeopardy. When we first meet Lenny, he defensively argues with the school principal who has taken the children out of school for picking fights with other kids. Lenny does crazy things like walking on his hands across the street with the children. After having an argument with his girlfriend, he picks up another woman and goes to bed with her. He then convinces this woman, a virtual stranger, to drive upstate with her boyfriend and brings the kids along on a mini-vacation.

We then experience more examples of bizarre parenting from Lenny. He places a lizard inside a cereal box as a prize for the boys; an acquaintance comes over and ends up sleeping with Lenny in his bed (it's not clear whether they have sex); and he's mugged by a man on the street at gunpoint but fails to mention the incident to the children. Lenny also takes unnecessary risks when he's with adults: he hangs out with his bizarre girlfriend who insists on meeting him at the next train stop by walking through a subway tunnel; he also hangs out with undesirable companions and they all get arrested one night for making graffiti.

The crisis of the film's second act occurs after Lenny is unable to find a babysitter for the children but must show up at his job as a projectionist. He ends up giving the kids what he thinks is a small dosage of sedatives but they fail to wake up in the morning. A doctor friend comes over and informs Lenny that the children are okay but in a coma which they might not wake up from for a couple of days or even a week. You've really got to your suspend your disbelief that a doctor wouldn't have called the police in this situation. As it turns out, all's well that ends well when the children wake up after being out cold for about two days.

The film's denouement occurs when Lenny decides to abduct the children and move to a new apartment. The Safdies indicate that this actually happened to them at the hands of their father but ultimately he wasn't arrested in real life. In most child abduction cases, the offending parent is much more cunning than the impulsive Lenny. What happens is the children are usually taken out of state. Here, Lenny remains in New York City, where presumably he will be ultimately caught and arrested for child abduction.

There's are some very nice things about 'Daddy Longlegs', particularly Bronstein's performance as the irresponsible parent. The Safdies also utilize quite a number of non-professional actors to very good effect in this film. On the down side, the film's cinema verite style is dated and I hope that the Safdies will be able to prove they're capable of shooting in different genres and styles in the future. Finally, the other characters in the film are virtual ciphers; they have no back story and are only there to highlight Lenny's impulsivity and idiosyncrasies.

Perhaps the most admirable aspect of Daddy Longlegs is the creators' forgiving nature. Despite not being treated very well by their father as children, they have managed to forgive him as adults and in the fictional arena, have created a complex portrait of a fictional father who is both loving and cruel at the same time.",1296864000,,4399,4.689119170984456
8474834,5,B005ION4VK,"The Safdie brothers make a film about their father, who comes across as a sort of Peter Pan type: loving and imaginatively playful but thoroughly irresponsible as a parent--very nearly criminally so. As an adult in relation to other adults in his life, particularly his ex-wife and the boys' diligent mother, he's a manipulative user. The film is typically ""indie"" in technical style: hand-held camera, and so forth. But excellent script, acting, and direction. It's much more a character study (and what a character!) than a strongly plotted story, but the episodes are diverting enough to carry the movie through to a necessarily unresolved ending. Some of the father's actions are jaw-droppingly irresponsible; the comic and the horrifying mix to varying degrees.",1521331200,,766,5.286885245901639
8474835,5,B005ION4VK,"I find all the Safdie Brothers' movies very interesting ,edgy, and well made. Can't wait to see 'GoodTime', starring Robert Pattinson, which received a six minute standing ovation at the 'Cannes Film Festival' this past May.",1501804800,,224,5.25

8474837,1,B005ION4VK,"I guess that I'm simply a mid-westerner at heart and this was *so* New York. We're just different from one another because we all adapt to our surroundings. On the plus side, Bronstein's performance was challenging and executed thoroughly; I completely believed him.",1464393600,,266,5.209302325581396
8474838,5,B005ION4VK,The move may have some nudity but it  does a good job of making you like some of the characters and hating them at the same time.  In other words the move is well made.,1378339200,,168,3.7714285714285714

8474840,3,B005ION4VK,"Finally, a movie that transcends father-son stereotypes.  His flaws are obvious as a sort of lazy, careless, prankster big city con artist.  Yet his good natured and fun loving attempts to be pals with the young sons suggest a glimmer of hope.  A dad like this should simply admit to the sons he is not what they should become.  I really wish we could have seen another year or two...did he shape up or get his unsupervised visitation revoked?",1351123200,,443,4.569620253164557
8474841,4,B005ION4VK,"`Daddy Longlegs' reminds me a tad of 2008's `Wendy and Lucy', not in the story but in the overall tone and development.  Both films delve into the complex state of internal loneliness and the innate need to find something to bring us closure.  Where Wendy had her dog Lucy, and the thought of being separated from her brought her immense internal torment; Lenny has his children.

Lenny is a divorced father of two.  He is immature and impulsive.  He only gets to see his sons for two weeks out of the year, and he spends those weeks juggling his responsibilities (which he often shrugs aside) with his play time, which includes philandering with strangers and drinking, a lot.  `Daddy Longlegs' follows the few weeks he has with his boys and shows the emotional depth Lenny possesses in his person.  Lenny is a boy, not yet a man, who doesn't understand how to balance his duty as a father with his innate need to be a friend to his boys.  He is careless and insensitive yet protective and loving.  He sees his position as `father' as a blessing but he fails to understand that it is also a responsibility.  As Lenny shuffles his kids around, handing them off to seemingly perfect strangers so as to carry on with his life as if they weren't there, we can see how the weight of parenthood has not fully rested on this man (possibly because of his overall lack of time spent with them).  Still, as impractical as he is, Lenny's love for his children is often displayed with sincerity, keeping this man a rich example of what adolescent parenting can result in (although he is far from a child himself, he surely represents those `youthful' at heart).

The film's largest strength comes in the form of Ronald Bronstein.  His performance as Lenny is magnetic and charismatic, full of a jovial life and presence that is never betrayed by a deeper understanding of his character's emotional flaws.  The way he shifts, so effortlessly, from selfishness to frantic concern is authentic and deeply moving.  It is a `small' performance in that Bronstein really finds the subtleness of his character, living in the moment and not allowing the moments themselves to oversell his character.

This film is not without flaw though.  I found the film's conclusion to be a tad underdeveloped.  It seemed a little jumpy, unfocused and confused and I found myself unsure of what was really taking place.  I also found the dream sequence to be an awkward spot, something that was necessary to convey the point being made since Bronstein himself had been making that point the entire film (he builds those layers so marvelously).  Still, like `Wendy and Lucy', `Daddy Longlegs' is a film that will say with you because the poignancy of the plot is so reaching.  The film is anticlimactic on purpose because this isn't a film that goes anywhere specific; it is a film that captures a moment in time.  All consequences are left for the audience to ascertain on their own.",1325721600,2,2950,4.709551656920078
8474842,4,B005ION4VK,"Daryl Loomis, DVD Verdict --Daddy Longlegs is a far better production than the first film from the Safdie brothers. While it isn't very cinematic in any traditional sense, they have more started to embrace their roots in the indie pictures of John Cassavetes and his group. They adeptly show a landscape filled with poor immigrants and huge jerks struggling in a New York City that looks thirty years old, a feel that the distinct lack of modern technology greatly enhances. The performances are uniformly excellent, with Bronstein generating a ton of pathos in Lenny, when he mostly doesn't deserve it. Sage and Frey Ronaldo may have only had to be kids watching a manic dude run around, but you couldn't ask for more believable child actors. Nobody else plays a huge role in the film, but everyone puts their all into Josh and Benny Safdie, and it shows in the results.

From Zeitgeist Films, Daddy Longlegs has been treated to an excellent package, lovely on the outside and deep on the inside. The film was shot in 16mm, so there are obvious limitations in the image transfer, but it looks as good as it possibly can. It's grainy with washed-out colors, but that's wholly intentional and the transfer is perfectly solid. The stereo sound doesn't have any noise to speak of, but is unspectacular.

What makes the disc is the packaging and features. The slimline case is housed in a painted cardboard sleeve along with two booklets. The first is a collection of images from the film along with an essay about the production and, more generally, about the Safdie brothers. The second, entitled ""While They're Sleeping,"" is a collection of photos that the filmmakers' father took of them while they slept. It's a kind of strange inclusion, but it does make the direct connection of their own lives to those of the kids in the film. On the disc itself, we start with eight deleted scenes that give a little more background, but they have been excised for clear reasons. A making-of documentary called The Second Stop from Jupiter features footage from a number of different people, all of which looks oddly similar to the film itself. Another short piece called Go Get Some Rosemary (the working title of the film) documents the first meeting between Bronstein and the kids, with Bronstein already in character and acting crazy. A few bits of promotional fodder, including one really funny animated sequence, and a theatrical introduction close out the disc.

8474843,5,B005ION4VK,"Daddy Longlegs concerns the ironies, wounds, adventures and potentially inspiring memories flowing from childhood. The fictional movie is based on the true childhood experiences of New York-born independent filmmakers Josh and Benny Safdie, who reportedly are popular in Europe but are almost unknown in the U.S. With Daddy Longlegs, that should change.

The best way to envision this movie is to imagine Cosmo Kramer from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/hit-comedy-series-Seinfeld/dp/B000VECAEE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">hit comedy series Seinfeld</a>&nbsp;suddenly finding that he will become the full-time caretaker of his two small sons for a two-week period each year. Of course, Kramer never was married and never had children in the Seinfeld series, but Ronald Bronstein (who plays the father in Daddy Longlegs) could easily be Kramer's long-lost brother. Like Kramer, Bronstein's ""Lenny"" is tall with a long, funny, deeply lined face and an uncontrollable shock of hair on top. Like Kramer, Lenny is full of wild schemes that should produce a happy life--and often backfire in the gritty streets and high rises of New York City.

For anyone who is a fan of Seinfeld, and ""gets"" that style of wild-and-inventive urban humor, then Daddy Longlegs is a sometimes-amusing and sometimes-moving look at what a real-life Seinfeld world would do to children. You'll laugh. You'll worry. You'll cry. Lenny is far less funny than Kramer when two ""real"" kids' lives hang in the balance!

Nevertheless, for anyone who went through a traumatic childhood with a truly out-of-control parent, this can be a healing film. Especially watching the ""extras"" with the adult Safdie brothers working on the production of this movie, one realizes that--for all the weirdness their father showered down around them--they loved this always-down-on-his-luck Dad. Even in the film's final scenes, you won't know whether to be angry, to shed a tear or to smile in delight. Perhaps all three responses are appropriate as the final credits roll--and that's the mark of great filmmaking.",1322956800,,2110,5.649842271293376
