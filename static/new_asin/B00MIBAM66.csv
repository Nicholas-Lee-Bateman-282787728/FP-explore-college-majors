8672613,1,B00MIBAM66,"Wise I had seen other review before I ordered. As they previously stated, bad copy. DVD kept freezing and after it stopped freezing, volume stopped working. I would not buy from them again.",1410825600,8,189,4.757575757575758
8672614,1,B00MIBAM66,"I love this musical.  It is a happy memory of my childhood.  The story, the color, the music, and, especially, Cyril Ritchard, are wonderful.  This version, with Mary Martin, is far superior to the Sandy Duncan version.  I Do not like this disc.  It is a cheap, homemade looking copy that stopped after twenty minutes.  I got it going again, but it stopped again in the middle of Captain Hooks biggest number.  Surely, somewhere out there, there is a REAL manufactured copy of this production, and I must keep looking until I find it.  In the meantime. I will not buy from this seller, again.",1409961600,18,592,4.571428571428571
