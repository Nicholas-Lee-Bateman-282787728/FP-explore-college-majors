1831908,1,B00008976S,"This isn't a reference to the DVD but to the show in general. First of all, this is nothing like the actual manga in Shonen Jump. Me and my buddies are convinced that whoever made the 'show' read the 11th episode (which is the first and only one in whick Kaiba and Duel Monsters makes an appearance), looked at the covers of the others for names and faces (cuz the other characters including the main ones are nothing like they were in the manga. Example: Joey was a wannabe sleezy movie director, not a wimpy 'duelist') The manga was really funny (Yami Yugi wanted to sell the milennium puzzle on EBay and wrestled Yugi for it) and the villains were not realistic at all. My second reason is that  and pointless. First episode: Quothe the Joey ""Use the millenium puzzle, Yugi!"" Do I have a problem with this? I wouldn't if they EXPLAINED WHAT THE HELL THE BLOODY &@$#!@ THING WAS BEFORE THEY USED IT'S 'MAGICAL' POWERS! Finally, I hate the essential and ridiculous theme of the show which is ""Good Will Ultimately Triumph"" This inner theme is stupid because it is not correct and it makes the show boring because Yugi will always win in the end and therefore there's no challenge. I gave it one star only because I couldn't give it less.",1059091200,,1238,4.502222222222223
1831909,1,B00008976S,"This isn't specifically this DVD, but the Yu-Gi-Oh series in general. It's not as much a ""great anime"" as something more like Pokemon, something younger children can identify with easier, not that there aren't older fans. Still, the entire concept of this series is old: ""Believe in yourself"". The whole series is based off this, and in every episode there's usually some ""random chance"" in which the character has a flashback of all his friends, and then miraculously draws the winning card. Sure, more and more ""powerful"" cards appear, but nothing really changes. Find a better anime.",1058313600,,586,5.051546391752577

7980806,5,B00008976S,Yugioh is one of my favorite shows.,1425254400,,35,4.142857142857143
7980807,5,B00008976S,"Love this dvd, it brings back wonderful memories from when I was a little kid I'm so happy to finally get to watch this again!",1396915200,,126,4.08
7980808,5,B00008976S,"This is the best yugi v kaiba duel mostly because of the length. 3 episode means that the balance between filler and  duel action is to the point where our atention spans aren't maxed out. The best part is that the duel discs are shown off way more than in the scars of defeat.(vol 6.)BEUD is shown off for the first time in a most amazing way with a naration givin by kaiba basicly explaing that without exodia yugi has no real chance. I also really like how this is the only time were kaiba truely knew what yugi was fighting for, both had a family member in the shadow realem and fought him on the same level both beliving in the heart of the cards. Too bad after his duel with pegasus kaiba was never the same again untill the dawn of the duel stuff but only to a point. Overall best duel in the duelest kingdom story arc.",1308009600,,826,4.1625
7980809,5,B00008976S,"After reading some of the ridiculous reviews for this DVD below, I just had to help this item out.  The episodes are good.  The voice acting is excellent.  To be quite honest, I don't think too much of the Japanese episodes.  The dialogue is way too slow and boring.

I have no idea when prebuscent kids thought they were such experts on dubbing, but trust me, the episodes aren't as bad as they claim it to be.  Give it a shot and make *your* own decisions about it.",1113955200,2,467,4.25
7980810,1,B00008976S,"Well, basically this DVD's episode starts when the othere yugi and others, are going up the castle to defeat pegasus, to get yugi's grandfather back, but steo interrcepts them and demands a duel with yugi, if yugi wins he can go on if seto wins he takes yugis starchips (which allows him to move on) and gets to advance on peagasus instead.
Okay no thats done, I can talk about diffrent things, first is that the english version is baad, the voices are terrible, well most of them anyway, they don't show their emotions very well. Second is that it's too expensive as one of the reviewers have said you can get like 30 episodes for 30-40 dollars, this thing has only 3 -_-. They changed the plot alot, which doesn't stand a chance agains't the original, they edit things out. Also this show is aimed at 'kids' like 10, 8, 12 year olds and blah, though Im thirteen, as I like to say you can't really understand someone a diffrent age unless you are their age. This is where I disagree with the other person this anime can be for anyone for any ages..only if you can understand it and if you are not disturbed with it. Most people would think, oh my god you can't watch it beacause your'e 13! but hey I've got alsmost all the original box sets so blah. Um, yeah the dvd menu is really bad and Iv'e heard there is a 'yugioh rap' I think they treid to copy this with pocket monsters (pokemon)
I seriously advise you to buy the japanese version on the internet, it's more worthy of your money.",1079395200,,1488,4.336917562724015
7980811,3,B00008976S,"Don't be fooled by my review title; I am literally obsessed with the show.  It was this obsession of mine that led me to the original Japanese DVDs.  I'd like to comment that this DVD is a ripoff.  You're paying $17.95 for what, three episodes?  I don't think so, EVEN though these three episodes are some of the best ones of the show.  My average spending on Yu-gi-Oh DVDs is $30 for 31 episodes.  This means that I've spent about $210 for 171 episodes overall.  (In other words, it's about $.82 per episode, not including the two or three hour-long specials, as opposed to the $5.98 per episode you're paying for these DVDs.)  Personally, if you're over fifteen, I'd recommend the original Japanese DVDs as opposed to the American ones.  (Don't worry, the subtitles are good on all of the boxed sets except for the first one, which has mediocre subtitles that can be confusing since the translator was not too good.  The other sets have subtitles that are much better.)  With the Japanese DVDs, you get better voice acting (it sucks in the American version, you just can't tell until you've seen the original), more character development, a plot that makes more sense (yes, they chop up the plot before they send animes to America), and you get to see what happens before everyone else (I'm three or four seasons ahead of you guys.  Hee hee!).  If you're under fifteen, then you might want to stick with these DVDs, since the original version has more violence and cursing.  (Oh no!  The same smut that we see on TV everyday in a cartoon!  The horror!  0_o)
  Now, to the actual story.  The three episodes on this DVD are some of my personal favorites and I'd recommend them to anyone who enjoys some Seto vs. Yugi duels.  (Just wait one more season, guys.  You don't know what you're missing.)  This particular duel starts after Pegasus, the creator of Duel Monsters and the antagonist of the story (this season, anyway), offers Seto a deal: If Seto can defeat Yugi, he will earn the honor to duel with Pegasus and therefore have a shot at saving Mokuba, his younger brother.  Seto then challenges Yugi, who accepts.  The duel rages back and forth with neither side showing any mercy until Seto makes the duel dangerous and life-threatening by displaying how desperate he is to win.  What happens next?  Not telling!  ^__^  This duel is also the introduction of Seto's ultimate monster: The Blue Eyes Ultimate Dragon, a monster that I love.

  So, these episodes are excellent, but they are overpriced and the dub isn't as good as the original.  Still, this DVD set would make an excellent addition to any Yugioh fan's collection.  Whatever you decide, have fun and happy dueling!  ..",1074124800,2,2687,4.668803418803419
7980812,5,B00008976S,"I think the Yu-Gi-Oh anime is lame, and except for Kaiba(and even then, he was far more sadistic in the manga, but then again, who wasn't?), everyone is a stupid whiny cry-baby.  However, sick of seeing Yugi win repeated card match after card match, I'm happy to see that the ""unbeatable,"" game master is finally defeated, by his rival Kaiba no less!  About time someone finally beat him!  And not only does Kaiba take the victory, but he also severely screws with Shorty's... er, Yugi's head as well!  Yay Kaiba!",1067904000,,513,4.666666666666667
