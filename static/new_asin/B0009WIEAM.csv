8068311,5,B0009WIEAM,"We get an insight from her childhood played by Bonnie Wright (Ginny Weasley in the Harry Potter Films), her flirtatious days, her first marriage, her 11 day disappearance, and her second marriage. No longer is she the woman of mystery. Or does this just bring up more mystery and speculation?

The mid-age Christ1e is played by Olivia Williams (Anna Crowe in ""The Sixth Sense"") and the aged Christie was played by Anna Massey (Lady Bailey in ""Possession"".)

This film is a must for Christie fans and the curios alike. It holds your attention and you find yourself speculating and getting ahead of the story. The only drawback is the sound byte formula where they focus on one person or item no linger than five minutes and then cut to something else. Along with this is the back and forth through time gimmick where you start in the present and go back to her mid-age psychiatrist, then her childhood, then her disappearance, then her old age then, mid-age psychiatrist, and so forth.",1505433600,10,984,4.748538011695906
8068312,2,B0009WIEAM,Very disappointed - great that they used her words to tell the story but the recurring emphasis on the gunman dreams she had as a child felt extremely artificial.  Too much emphasis on her psychiatrist drawing out the story of her disappearance rather than on her life experiences.,1440806400,,281,4.854166666666667
8068313,5,B0009WIEAM,"Agatha Christie's life is as mysterious and compelling as her books were to millions upon millions. And still are. Of course many only know her by her protagonists Miss Marple and Poirot. Her stories remain in print and continue to be adapted for movies and television. Her play written in the early 1950s continues to run in London, and has continuously since the first curtain. Arguably she is the most significant mystery author of the past, present and future.

This DVD is historical drama, almost a biography documentary. It is compelling in its portrayal of Christie in two moments in her life. One is the visits to a psychologist after her several day disappearance; never fully explained. The other is the press meeting for her play's opening. The camera jumps back and forth between the two time periods revealing the life and mind of Agatha like no other presentation I have ever seen.
Anna Massey, a brilliant UK actress, does her remarkable best in portraying the attitude of Agatha as the older version.

Although it is a 2004 BBC presentation, it is timeless and as contemporaneously done as any drama today. The advantage to buyers, is the price is lower, and used very inexpensive.
Should be of interest to fans of Marple and Poirot. A docu-drama done in the style of an Agatha Christie mystery.",1396742400,3,1312,4.826666666666667
8068314,5,B0009WIEAM,"Being a major Agatha Christie fan, I must say I enjoyed this movie.  I've also read Agatha Christie's autobiography.  Based on that book and the various interviews and other media on her life and writing, this biography comes pretty close to the real story, (or at least what we know of it).  I wasn't so much interested in her disappearance, I wanted to see her whole life brought to the screen and this film did a nice job.  It's by no means perfect, but it entertained me and that's the bottom line. I'm happy to add this to my Christie collection.  It is also far more plausible than the movie ""Agatha"" with Vanessa Redgrave and Dustin Hoffman.  As a fan, I have to say I like the fact that we will never fully know the true story of Mrs. Christie's disappearance.  I little mystery from one of the world's greatest mystery writers.  If you're a fan, I think you'll enjoy this movie.",1396569600,3,887,4.432098765432099
8068315,4,B0009WIEAM,"Agatha Christie, A Life in Pictures, was very well written and directed, and the actress, Olivia Williams made Agatha Christie so believably charming, you felt as though you had stepped into one of her books. Any information about this wonderful mystery writer is welcomed in my home, including this understated movie about her personal life.  I will probably watch it a couple more times just to make sure I absorbed it all!",1388534400,2,425,4.902777777777778

8068317,3,B0009WIEAM,"In fact, I'm not even sure what they mean by ""A Life In Pictures."" I had hoped to see an in-depth portrayal of her life, but this docu-drama focuses mainly on Christie's psychological issues: haunting dreams she had in her younger years and her famous, mysterious disappearance. The filmmaker uses an interesting technique of telling the story in flashback from two different starting points: Christie in 1962 at the 10th anniversary celebration of her play ""Mousetrap,"" and Christie in 1926 in a psychiatrist's office trying to piece herself together after the disappearance. The flashback events are depicted out of chronological order, so it's a bit confusing at times for those like myself who are unfamiliar with Christie's life.

Hardcore Christie fans will likely enjoy this psychological collage, but those wanting an informative essay on Agatha Christie may wish to look elsewhere.",1282780800,,890,5.3120567375886525
8068318,5,B0009WIEAM,"I've always wondered about the 11-day disappearance of mystery writer icon Agatha Christie, and this dramatic rendition depicting that time was done extremely well. It's true to the facts, seriously creepy and quite sad. But of course, as with all her novels, ends the way it should. I loved it.",1196208000,,295,4.92
8068319,3,B0009WIEAM,"The '04 documentary style film `Agatha Christie - A Life in Pictures' provides a marginally interesting biography/psychological study of the famous English mystery novelist Agatha Christie. The film bounces back and forth through time to tell its story, featuring Oliva Williams and Anna Massey in the role of Agatha at different stages of life. The primary focus of the plot deals with Agatha's infamous eleven missing days of that baffled England and the apparent and convenient amnesia following her return.

In an attempt to add to the documentary feel of the feature the film switches to black and white during the recreated sequences involving the investigation and search for the missing literary icon as well as some of the scenes of her life discussed with a psychologist during treatment after her return to her family.

There are some intriquing aspects worthy for investigation into the author's life such as the reoccurring apparition of what she referred to as ""the Gunman"", but overall her life unfolds as a rather dull and gloomy existence. This isn't a bad film by any means, it's just something geared to a very select audience. Agatha Christie fans will no doubt love it.

My Rating: -3  Stars.",1191715200,9,1213,5.019900497512438
8068320,5,B0009WIEAM,This movie is very interesting for any Agatha Christie fan but would be enjoyable even for a person who knows nothing of Agatha C. or her work.  The story is set in the years around WWI and is a glimpse of England in those years.,1173657600,,229,4.088888888888889
