8515500,4,B007F1EUPS,"The subject of Eunice Hoskinson Rockefeller, my second great grand aunt, was enough to keep me captivated throughout this video presentation. The production values are primitive but still effective at presenting Russ Fry's research into the life and death of this interesting lady. There is no live action video. The presentation is more akin to powerpoint with a music and narration soundtrack. There's plenty of information here with photos, news story research and family lore. The information is presented well and I found it interesting; holding my attention throughout. This is more for knowledge than entertainment for sure, but still a nice tribute to a lady who lived in hard times and died unjustly.",1345420800,3,709,5.228070175438597
