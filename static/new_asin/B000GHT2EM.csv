8132306,5,B000GHT2EM,Scott McKenzie's voice is slightly frayed but it is amazing that at his age he was still occasionally showing signs of that velvet sound. What a great song.,1485734400,,156,4.607142857142857
8132307,4,B000GHT2EM,"I saw this concert on PBS and enjoyed it very much, as I did its predecessor and many of the American Soundtrack concerts on PBS. I agree with the other reviewer about the sound quality being sometimes less than stellar; it is also difficult to hear the performer on other concert specials of the series - I guess it must be the acoustics.  A few notes in addition to the editorial description on the product page:  I'd Like to Teach the World to Sing is performed by the Hillside Singers, and both Georgy Girl and I'll Never Find Another You, both performed by the Seekers, is on this DVD.  A Serendipitous Reunion refers to the Serendipity Singers, for those who don't know (I didn't until I watched the show initially).  If you like 1960's music, then I highly recommend this show.",1185840000,3,784,4.539007092198582
8132308,3,B000GHT2EM,"This was an overall great concert.  Trini Lopez comes back to the stage after 20 years!  One major complaint is the annoying audience clapping that is dubbed over the concert!  When the camera pans over the audience while this clapping is going on, one can clearly see that audience is not even clapping, therefore it must have been dubbed.  Even so, it is great to hear the excellent music in modern-day sound quality.",1166054400,4,419,4.698630136986301
