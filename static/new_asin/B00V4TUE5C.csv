8709194,4,B00V4TUE5C,"Furious is a marvel of no-budget filmmaking, the result of two guys throwing every loony idea they had at the wall and putting whatever stuck (and much more!) into one explosive 73-minute package.  What other no-buck film has endless karate fights, aliens, wizards who shoot chickens from their fingers, surprise rock bands, mountain men doing the ""Great White North"" falsetto call, flaming skeletons, helicopter shots and a Chinese restaurant with solemn sword-flailing demonstrations as their entertainment?  The fact that this DVD was released is a miracle in itself, because Furious is an extremely rare movie that made no dent when it was originally released direct-to-video in the 80's.  I went to a screening of the film before this DVD was announced at Seattle's Scarecrow Video and its co-creator Tim Everitt, who just happens to live in the area, came to see his magnum opus in front of an eager audience, and he said that the original video master for the film is actually lost, most likely taped over or destroyed.  Everitt and his co-creator Tom Sartori both went on to successful careers behind the scenes in Hollywood and you really couldn't think of a more fun first film for them to have on their resume.  Furious must truly be seen to be believed, a one-of-a-kind amateur extravaganza that I wouldn't change a frame of.",1438905600,5,1337,4.950892857142857
8709195,5,B00V4TUE5C,"In the 80s, walking into a video rental stores martial arts section was like waiting in line for a rollercoaster: The anticipation was just as exciting as the ride itself. The movie that was finally decided on was always hit or miss, but it was the browsing experience that mattered most. In between all the usual Shaolin, Bruceploitation and Ninja flicks, there was that one VHS box you kept stumbling upon, but never rented. Everyone had one. Mine was 1984s Furious.

At first glance, the original VHS box for Furious resembled a typical, dubbed Hong Kong kung fu flick from the 70s: a shirtless Bruce Lee wannabe in a martial arts stance; a grim-looking, grey-haired grandmaster; a black dude with a half-afro sporting traditional Chinese garb; and of course, an attractive warrioress in a don't f*ck with me formation. But if you take the time to read its marketing hook  Filmed Entirely on Location in Southern California and Red Hot Karate Action! All New! Never Before Show in Theaters or on TV!  the hint is there: This isn't your typical martial arts film. In fact, it isn't even your typical film.

Furious is an American-made feature written and directed by Tim Everitt (Too Fast Too Young) and Tom Sartori. Filmed in one week  without a script  with a budget of $30,000, the movie is one heck of an oddity. Its the type of flick that only ones own eyes can describe as they're watching it. For the sake of this review, Ill do my best

The film opens with a female (Arlene Montano) getting chased and murdered by white guys dressed in Mongol-like attire. The females brother, Simon (Simon Rhee), a martial arts teacher who lives in a treehouse with a bunch of his young students, sets out to avenge her death. Under the guidance of his master (Phillip Rhee), Simons search for revenge turns into a spiritual quest filled with mystery, deception and above all, action!

To give you an idea of just how bizarre this movie is, heres a rundown of what to expect: Evil magicians who shoot chickens out of their hands; people transforming into talking pigs; martial arts masters flying around like Superman; a replicant army dressed up like members of the band Devo (speaking of rock bands, Furious has that too!); opponents turning into giant, fire-breathing dragons; and a subplot of how an alien race turns humans into chickens to lower food costs for their chain of restaurants. Oh yeah, lets not forget about the films soundtrack, which sounds like something youd hear in a movie from the 1930s.

Above all the weirdness, what really stands out is how Furious has almost no dialogue at all. According to director Tim Everitts audio commentary, he wanted to tell the story visually. However, Everitt contradicts himself: he later mentions it was decided to keep the dialogue to a minimum so it can be sold to a global market and dubbed with any language, with very little work. Whatever the case, the films limited dialogue only adds to the films peculiar charm.

For those watching it for the martial arts sequences alone are in for a real treat. Everitt and Sartori obviously gave the Rhee brothers total creative freedom when it came to the action choreography. The hand-to-hand combat is authentic, fluid and captured mostly in long takes. There are a few sloppy set ups, continuity issues and other amateuristic moments, but for the most part, saying the fight scenes are years ahead of they're time isn't an exaggeration. Considering what the Rhee brothers would accomplish a few years later, none of this should come as a surprise. Look out for a fight sequence in a restaurant where Simon takes out several bad guys who rush him at the same time. Its impressive as all hell.

The films overall cinematography ranges from spotty to superb. One minute, were getting camera work from someone who might be on acid; the next minute, we see an impressive aerial shot. According to Everitt, a shell-shocked helicopter pilot, who fought in Vietnam, was paid $300 a day to capture these shots. Talk about being resourceful.

Furious is the first film to star brothers Simon and Phillip Rhee (4 years before the pair found the greener pastures of Hollywood in the Best of the Best franchise), both of whom hold Black Belts in Taekwondo and Hapkido. The rest of the films cast consists mostly of the Rhees own students and friends, including an early appearance by Loren Avedon (No Retreat, No Surrender II). Also appearing is former World Kickboxing Champion, Howard Jackson (Code of Silence), former Miss Philippines, Arlene Montano (L.A. Streetfighters) as well as a quick cameo by Susanna Hoffs (of the popular 80s band, The Bangles).

In recent years, Furious reached a cult status and started to get theatrical screenings in festival circuits around the country. Pre-owned VHS copies of the film would sell on eBay for $50-$100. It was around this time that Everitt approached Leomark Studios for a proper release, which is exactly whats happening on July 21, 2015 when the film finally makes its official debut on DVD. In addition to the feature  mastered from a high quality source  you also get some extras, including trailers, and an amusing commentary by Everitt himself.

The bottom line: Furious is 72 minutes of unconventional entertainment thats part so bad, its good and part hidden gem. Highly recommended.",1437609600,9,5329,4.858875413450937
