8256220,2,B0014SW3WA,"This is the only canoe technique DVD I could find.  I would rate it satisfactory, except for an immense problem: no table of contents or ability to skip to different scenes.  So, if you wish to review the J-stroke, you must watch the entire video, or spend 20 minutes trying to find the scene with J-stroke!  The content is satisfactory, but not good at demonstrating strokes.  I find better instruction for free on YouTube.  Some demonstrations are rushed and you must replay repeatedly to comprehend details.  This DVD has several negatives: starts with commercials and advertisements you're unable to skip over, irrelevant skits meant to entertain (?), overly basic admonitions like apply sunscreen to bare skin, and annoying bad music. I did not buy a canoeing video to learn about sun screen!  The music in the beginning is especially loud, so you turn down the volume but can't hear the narrators' voices later on.",1341100800,,920,4.935064935064935
8256221,5,B0014SW3WA,"If your're looking for a begginer to mid-level educational video on Canoeing, that's the one!  Good footage and humor too.  But remember to also look for a nice ACA training course, as no video can replace a person-to-person experience.",1337990400,,236,5.0256410256410255
8256222,4,B0014SW3WA,"I ordered this DVD for our Grandson who is about to be married. He and his fiancee have just started canoeing. When my husband and I first canoed, we had never been in a canoe. As I was trying to navigate a water falls on a curve, I was very scared. I had my son in the canoe with me and my huaband and 2nd son had navigated the falls and were watching me try to stay afloat. I yelled to him, ""I want a divorce."" Therefore I wanted my Grandson to begin his new sport and marriage with knowledge and love. They now have viewed the DVD and are ready to lovingly take on the sport.",1219795200,3,578,3.948717948717949
