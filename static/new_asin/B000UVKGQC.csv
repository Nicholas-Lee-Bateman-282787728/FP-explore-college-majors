2925671,5,B000UVKGQC,"Who doesn't LOVE Shrek?  The trilogy was hours of fun for me.  It's a great series for kids, teaches loyalty, that obstacles can be overcome and to have faith in yourself.  Yet, as an adult, I love the comedic banter between Shrek & Donkey and the suave & debonair cat is a hysterical!  It's a winner for the entire family.",1197849600,2,323,4.333333333333333

2925673,1,B000UVKGQC,"Why on earth are they only offering these movies in full screen?  Even if you don't have an HDTV you still want these in widescreen.  I won't be buying any of the Shrek movies until a widescreen box set is available.  Come on Dreamworks, get on it!!",1195516800,15,249,4.25531914893617
2925674,4,B000UVKGQC,"Although I can see some disappointment from the HD crowd for not having this trilogy in wide-screen HD, these Shrek movies are still enjoyable in the old 4:3 aspect view. Just watch one on TV to see if it is worth a laugh in 2007, and it will be some years before HD wide screen is the standard on our sets. I think the view portraying the plot lines, etc., are good enough without showing the peripheral edges, although I agree in general you can miss some fun stuff. Maybe that is the one reviewer's point who gave it one star. When I get an HD wide screen setup I will certainly be able to afford to purchase the re-release in the better, high definition, wide-screen format. After all, I have all versions of Lord of the Rings because each version adds something. I thank the viewer for pointing out this this is a non-HD, regular aspect, but I am buying the trilogy anyway. He didn't say there were any other problems with the set. I had to return Shrek 1 when it first came out because the DVD failed and could not be watched.",1195084800,14,1032,4.297435897435897
2925675,1,B000UVKGQC,"As someone who enjoys the Shrek movies, I'm really disappointed in this box set. Before this I didn't own the first two movies, and thought this was a great deal for all three. I thought it would make me a cool uncle to have all three movies when my nephew visits.

The problem is I should have paid close attention to the screen format when ordering. I wrongly took it to mean that it was going to be in a wide screen format since it didn't specify full screen in the title. If I watched DVDs on a standard TV that might not be such a big deal, but I own a HDTV with an up-converting DVD player and prefer watching wide screen formated movies on it. They just look better on the screen.

Sadly Amazon does not offer this set in a wide screen format. So I'm either going to make do with the set I just ordered. Or, I'll have to order each movie separately if I want them in the wide screen format.",1194998400,95,897,4.090909090909091

2925687,5,B000UVKGQC,"Shrek- This is a very good movie with a great storyline and perfect for the whole family. Shrek is an ogre who lives in a swamp by himself. He runs into a talkative donkey named Donkey. When Lord Farquaad forces other fairy tale creatures into the swamp, Shrek and Donkey go to Farquaad's castle to regain his privacy. Farquaad gives Shrek a task, he must go save Princess Fiona from a castle surrounded by lava and protected by a fire-breathing dragon so that Farquaad can marry her and become king. After he rescues her, he slowly begins to fall in love with her. I highly recoomend SHREK!!!

Shrek 2- After their honeymoon, Shrek and Fiona are invited to Far Far Away to meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian. During their dinner, Harold is disgusted by Shrek's antics. Harold is soon visited by  Fairy Godmother, who is the mother of Prince Charming. Fairy Godmother is mad because Shrek was the one who saved Fiona from the castle in the original. She forces Harold to get rid of Shrek by any means necessary. He even hires a hairy assassin named Puss in Boots, but Puss soon changes sides and joins Shrek and Donkey. After taking a potion, Shrek and Fiona become real people, but Fiona has not yet seen Shrek, so Charming tries to convince her that he's Shrek. Will Shrek be able to stop him before midnight? I highly recommend SHREK 2!!!

Shrek the Third- King Harold is on his death bed and wants Shrek to be the king, but Shrek thinks it's a bad idea, so he asks if there is an heir to the throne. It turns out that his nephew, Arthur Pendragon is in line to be the next king, so Shrek, Donkey, and Puss set out to find him. While they are away, Prince Charming is planning revenge on Far Far Away and seeks help from the fairy tale villians. Will the gang be able to stop them? I highly recommend SHREK THE THIRD!!!",1248566400,,1839,4.4188790560471976
2925688,5,B000UVKGQC,"What can you say. I didn't know if I would like these movies during the first 30 minutes or so, but then just fell in love with the characters. Eddie Murpheys character is the one I loved best. He was hilarioius! Loved them all!!",1244332800,,229,4.2272727272727275
2925689,4,B000UVKGQC,Very good entertainment. Lots of fun for the cost of this set. I would rcommend this to all Shrek fans.,1239926400,,103,4.2
2925690,5,B000UVKGQC,"It's Shrek...what's not to love?  Much witty humor with some inappropriate remarks, but most kids don't even realize what was said.  Great buy for the family.  Each movie is just as good as the others.",1232496000,4,201,4.685714285714286
2925691,3,B000UVKGQC,"Great movies, especially Shrek and Shrek 2.  My 3 year-old son didn't care too much for Shrek The Third. Good price for all three movies.",1224201600,2,137,4.48

2925694,5,B000UVKGQC,"Love this for a family fun evening.  Purchased for grandchild 11, she loves it and has replayed a lot.  Want something that is good clean family fun and that your child can use when having friends over as well, buy this great set.",1208217600,,230,4.325581395348837
2925695,5,B000UVKGQC,"The good things about owning the Shrek Trilogy are that you get three discs for a little more than the price of two and you can follow the whole saga at once, since from the very early days at the swamp until the kingdom of Far Far Away. Each one of the movies has 90 minutes, so it is easy to watch all of them in a single weekend afternoon, from the very comfort of your home, or each disk at your convenience.

As for the movies, needless to say that the family appeal, cute storyline and fine animation production made all Shrek movies blockbusters by the time they were released for theaters. Want to relax and laugh a little? Want to put your kids at ease? These three disks will get the job done.",1207440000,,703,4.207407407407407
2925696,5,B000UVKGQC,The movies are in great condition and I received them very fast.  I recommend this seller.,1202428800,,90,4.625
2925697,5,B000UVKGQC,"I cannot say enough aboutt hese movies. The comedy, the stroylines, the cleverness in bringing new light to old fairytale characters, the sidekicks. Its all a fun ride.

Now, for each movie:
Shrek--5/5--This is the best in the franchise. Mostly becuase the storyline is more straightforward, and the characters are allowed more screentime. The villan is hilarious (the Gingy torture scene is priceless). Donkey is at his best in this installment.

Shrek 2--5/5--This one is equally as funny as the originl. And, I found myself loving the fairy godmother. I loved Puss-in-Boots, and he totally outshines Donkey here. The storyline is a bit boring, but they make up for it in comedy.

Shrek 3--4/5--I was not at all happy with this installment. But, still found teh comedy to be top-notch. My favorite addition this timearound was the Princesses and Mr. Merlin. That was a treat. But, Justin Timberlak fell flat. And, I did not like the ending--too sugary and cliche. And the villan was not as interesting as the previous ones. Overall, the first 2 were the best. But, this one is a nice comedy to enjoy as well.

A few people have regarded the trilogy as family comedy, and maybe so. But there are many references to things that would definately go over a child's head. And, that is the genuis of this franchise. The subtle jokes make the comedy that much funnier.

The trilogy is full of top-notch comedy and overall a 5/5.shrek",1202342400,,1428,4.812244897959184
2925698,5,B000UVKGQC,"Lighthearted, cute and well done.  Just what I needed for my ailing mother who cannot seem to watch TV with all of it's weighty news, medical programs and programs mostly geared to young adults. Being an artist, she also enjoyed the terrific animation.  Perfect for a little levity.",1201478400,,282,4.854166666666667
2925699,4,B000UVKGQC,"Shrek 2 & Shrek the Third special features were disappointing in content and format.  Clicking on Shrek filmmakers' commentary returned screen to main menu rather than the commentary.  Films themselves were veryentertaining, especially Shrek 2.",1201392000,,244,5.942857142857143
2925700,3,B000UVKGQC,"We love the Shrek movies.  My 2 and 3 year olds could watch them over and over.  The only complaint I had about this set was, one of the movies skips at a particular place when we watch it.  It has happened several times in the same part of the movie, so I am sure it is the acutal DVD, not our player.
The price was the lowest I could find anywhere, by far.",1200614400,,358,3.810810810810811

I decided to get them the whole collection, and they loved it. The Shrek 3 movie was cuite. All the movies were great. Some of the jokes were geared towards the adults, while still keeping the movie's light enough for the children to enjoy. These movies are great for everyone in the family.",1198972800,,416,4.415584415584416
2925705,4,B000UVKGQC,"The Shreck movies have great charm and endearing characters. Unfortunately there is a deterioration as the series proceeds. They try to add a sophistication to Shreck One which frequently misfires for me such as the 'Devil in Prada' Fairy Godmother in Shreck Two. But there is sufficient delight in Puss in Boots, and Donkey with his strange liason to the oversized but loving dragon to hold one's interest, as do Shreck and Fiona. Unfortunately there is a current tendency to insert concepts and images of cruelty and degredation into many stories aimed at the young. The real world is cruel enough without accurately recreating it in fantasy.",1198713600,3,644,5.02803738317757
