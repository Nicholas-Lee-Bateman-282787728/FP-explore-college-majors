8422839,5,B004C6UG48,"In my opinion this movie has more to say than the story. It is a direct representation of how dreams become reality and how we as people really should encourage the dreams of others to be realized. As a man thinketh, so is he. If you know Neville Goddard, buy this and amaze yourself at how true this is.",1373155200,2,304,4.169491525423729
8422840,5,B004C6UG48,"The movie touches upon the agony of loss.  It was made at a time when hordes of immediately post-WW II Americans struggled with the trauma of loss--both soldiers and the civilians that had waited for them to come back home--but that generation of Americans had no name for what ailed them, and did not know what it was (the blanket term ""neurotic"" would not come into widespread favor until after the 1960s).  As a result, they took their pains all too personally, thinking it was all about them rather than their loss.

  Such circumstances are rife for old-fashioned (even by the 1940s) female conversion hysteria reactions and male alcoholism reactions (""reactions"" as opposed to ""disorders"" because these condition arose specifically in response to mostly ""external"" rather than primarily ""internal"" circumstances).  Few were rescued by therapists (as few clinicians at of that era understood trauma and the risk of clinical retraumatization quite as we do today, although those that were focused on notions of Freudian abreaction would come closer to what was really going on inside the patient).

  Private citizens found themselves pretty much depending on each other as people in everyday relationships with one another to support each other through the nightmare of traumatic grief and other anxiety reactions (which would make Valium the Prozac of the 1970s).  This insured that successful coming out of it would be very much a hit-and-miss affair for these afflicted everyday folks duking it out with each other in the arena of intimacy provided by their everyday relationships with one another.

  The movie depicts addressing what I would call ""emotional disturbance"" as opposed to ""mental illness"" (the latter tending to be more ""organic"" in cause).  As a post-WW II displaced person and refugee, I was deeply touched to see this piece of my parents' prime time.  To the world of those days, American movies were a window into life that was not available anywhere else.  As a medically and legally educated couple, they exhibited all the natural, Nick-and-Nora coolness and poise of the couple portrayed so well by the film's beloved stars, but also the problematic dealing with emotional trauma that this couple illustrated equally well.  I shed a tear or two over the people they reminded me of.  My mother is now 95 and waning as she misses my father (her partner in escape from Stalinist Eastern Europe) terribly.  She has become small and shrunken by age (which bothers her vanity to no end), but she tries to hold on to as much pride as she can as she struggles with having by now lost all the friends we escaped and immigrated with.  She refuses to go out and meet any people because she feels she cannot take any further losses--perhaps being reminded too much of her own mortality, but I think also a bit of reviving of an old survivor guilt.

  As a clinician and teacher myself I was very pleased to find this little movie to share with my student practitioners for expansion of their sensibilities beyond their iphone sociability.  I regard sharing this film with them to be the gift of an experience that will very much deepen their perspective--even if the techniques illustrated may occasionally prove a bit dated.",1370217600,2,3243,4.962962962962963
