2510043,3,B000E8NRTO,"[ACTUALLY 2.5 STARS] If a kid can do a spy job, a monkey can do. `Spymate' features a super-spy chimpanzee `Minky' who can not only fly like a bird but also beat up the baddies and rescue the kidnapped secret agent (and Minky's partner) Mike (Chris Potter). If you see this opening sequence, you know exactly what you will see. `Spymate' is directed by Robert Vince, who (as producer) gave us the `Air Bud' series. Like his previous canine films, the clever animal is the main reason for which the film is made.

The story is a pale imitation of other family pictures. It is about one brilliant girl Amelia, only daughter of Mike, who invented `iodine oxide' laser drill. Sorry if I made a mistake about the exact name of her invention, but it is one great invention, the film says, for which Amelia is tricked into a conspiracy, and is kidnapped (without her knowing) by one bad scientist, who is about to do a most dangerous experiment in Japan.

So who is going to save her? And save the world too? It is Minky who goes back to work with the jolly members of the circus troupe. Equipped with the gadgets, and helped by the ninja troop, Minky and Mike go to Japan to rescue her and prevent the country's destruction.

To be frank, the story is thin and the gags are stale. But I am an adult, and I am not sure how the kids, especially pre-teens, would find the film. The gags are mostly slapstick, all too familiar type like a fat lady rolling like a ball, and some parodies of the 007 films such as ""Dr. No"" and Ursula Andress and her famous beach scene.

The cast include Emma Roberts (daughter of Eric Roberts, which means niece of Julia), Chris Potter, Richard Kind, Debra Jo Rupp, Michael Bailey Smith, Musetta Vender. Pat Morita appears as the master of Japanese ninja troop. But you know, it is Minky who steals the show.

`Spymate' is an innocuous family picture. It is a low-budget romp trying to keep the ball rolling, but its unoriginality (except the chimpanzee) is painfully obvious. It is not awful, and some parts are amusing, but largely uninspired.",1138665600,6,2067,4.516042780748663
8107349,5,B000E8NRTO,"An amazing film, not necessarily just for kids but for teens and those still young at heart!

The chimp is a comedic delight. The cast are amusing and crazy even in places. My favourite part involved the film cutting back and forth between a chimp mixing cocktails really close to the camera, and also a lady rolling around on the floor, in tight PVC trousers.

I don't quite recall why any of this was happening. I've seen this at least 2 or 3 times under various circumstances, usually with friends. It has never failed to raise belly laughs across the room.

In my opinion, you will love this film unless you have no sense of joy and wonder anymore.",1487894400,,652,4.46218487394958

8107356,5,B000E8NRTO,"Well I have read the other reviews, and I am sorry the reviewers did not see fit to give the movie a higher rating.  First, it is important to remember this movie was made for kids to watch.  The rating of five stars I am giving it is not because I think it deserves five stars, it is because of the rave reviews my kids have given it this past fall (fall 2012)./  I have been teaching English language classes to different groups of kids between the ages of seven to ten for the most part.  I can say for a fact I showed the movie to a number of different classes, and the kids--both girls and boys--all loved it!  In fact, even a few months later when I offered them the chance to watch a movie they were saying, ""Let's watch that monkey movie again.""/  Yes, some of the jokes are corny, and the plot is thin...but it's a KIDS' movie for crying out loud!  Thankfully the movie moves along pretty well and does not stall.  At eighty-five minutes it seems just about perfect to keep everyone's attention.  I found myself enjoying the movie as I watched along with the kids and joked around with them.  It is definitely the kind of movie you want to watch WITH kids./  Pat Morita (Sensei Miyagi from ""Karate Kid"" fame) makes an appearance in the movie as Minke the Monkey's mentor and helper.  I just can't help but crack up every time I see this spoof on his days as Sensei Miyagi.  Like my kids, I can't seem to get enough--at least of this part of the movie./  To sum up, watch this movie WITH kids, and like you ARE a kid watching with kids.  That's the secret to having a good time with this movie.  For Minke's heroics and Pat Morita's impeccable comic timing, as well as the votes of all my kids, I'm giving this movie five stars!",1361059200,4,1736,4.246951219512195
