5391304,5,B00A705IJG,"Agent Lee Han-gyoo fails to stop an infamous North Korean assassin, known as Shadow, and his protg, Ji-won, from assassinating a North Korean defector. Han-gyoo is discharged, and Ji-won is mistakenly labeled as a traitor. Years later, Han-gyoo and Ji-won begin to work together as private investigators, each with ulterior motives. Secret Reunion is a tense, often humorous action film.

The story in this film is great. It works perfectly as a thrilling action film with hilarious comedy elements; it also has some commentary on people and their inhumane actions, regardless of origin (as in, because someone is from a different area/region, it doesn't automatically make them a bad person). The underlying messages aren't heavy or preached, you can watch this movie strictly for its high entertainment value. I was lost for the first few minutes, but I was quickly able to grasp the story; the rest of the storytelling was smooth. There are plenty of witty exchanges/actions between characters, intense chase scenes and shootouts, and a few twists, as well. The ending of the film was very suspenseful and surprising. The acting was great, Song Kang-Ho and Kang Dong-won were amazing as the leads. The music was great, what you'd expect from a modern action film.

Overall, Secret Reunion is a superb action-thriller with genuinely funny moments. As of 4/23/13, this film is available on Netflix Streaming and Amazon Prime Instant Video, a purchase is recommended for fans of the genre, a rental otherwise.

Secret Reunion has strong violence and blood.",1366675200,3,1556,5.166666666666667
5391305,4,B00A705IJG,"It was different aspect of spy movie with humor and humanity. I was able to learn somewhat current situation of South Korea regarding the foreigners from southeast Asia and a very possible case of North Korean spy activity. May have to watch one more time to comprehend the contact method of NK spies are using but it would not hinder understanding the whole story, though. The three major actors (a former NIS member who fired from his job, a young North Korean spy who cannot go back to NK, and the veteran NK spy and assassin known as ""shadow"") in the movie played their roles so faithfully that the contrast among them brought up the level of reality higher. Am I contridicting with my review title here? Well, that is how I roll.

I would recommend this movie to someone who is interest in Korean current culture and movie.",1363046400,,828,4.557046979865772
5391306,5,B00A705IJG,"It's a combination of international spy thriller, expose of human trafficking, buddy movie and shoot-em-up action movie. Totally unique in fact. The acting is superb, as is the direction and camera work. It has the look of a big budget film which I'm sure it was in Korea. I've become a big fan of the South Korean film industry, which along with films from Norway and Sweden are the best movies being made for the last few years. Thank goodness we don't have be only subject to the dreck that Hollywood produces.",1362441600,13,513,4.586956521739131
5391307,4,B00A705IJG,"A little slow at the end of the second act, beginning of the third, but really a neat relationship dynamic going on. I might have given it 3.5 or 3.75 stars if I could have, but it's better than 3, so... 4 for the effort. The Korean guards infiltrating to the North for adventure, I'd seen. The northern spies in the South, specifically Seoul, I had not. New material here, dealing with the seemingly untouched subject of espionage between the Koreas, except North to South. The hard edge of the northern characters versus the weaker, yet organized southerners (trying to catch them)... the codes, the fights, etc. Neat. If you're from the U.S. or Europe, you get to see Seoul, too, which is not every day. The South Korean lead has a good command of his part. Carries the action and the humor well. The Northern spy comes off a bit boyish at first, but leaps into action with an authority.

Maybe just me, but I thought they cg'd a part or two that wasn't necessary. Not to the point that an American film might, but still...

Not a bad little movie. Don't really want to get into a fight with an agent from either of the Koreas, now, thanks. :)",1358035200,2,1146,4.42654028436019
5391308,4,B00A705IJG,"The title is kind of misleading.  The actual title in Korean is bonded brother, or sore of like that.
How many times do you see people say they will be brothers and get betrayed or never hear from them again?
It is so common in today's society. However, in this film, a spy from North Korea became a brother with a South Korean Secret Agent.  It was moving to see brotherly bond develop in the film.

I was expecting a little more of spy materials, but well it wasn't really necessary to develope the story.

Enjoyed it",1355875200,4,519,4.319587628865979
5391309,5,B00A705IJG,"I saw this film in the Korean Cinema Festival in my city, before that, i never saw anything from Korea.  The film is marvelous, thrilling, it will take your breath away.

5391310,4,B00A705IJG,"what a good movie!! knowing these actors, i thought this would be an action movie and while there were def bits of action, it was more about humanity in itself. its about a south korean agent and a north korean spy who end up living together after both of their careers hit rock bottom. at first they are spyinig on each other and trying to capture the other, but soon their relationship develops and they learn to see the actual human beyond the job and citizenship. had funny moments, had action moments, but the whole thing was really sweet and interesting to watch their rleationships develop. great acting from both leads- they had to express a lot with jsut facial movements and expressions since it was a lot about observing them/their faces while they were thinking about the other person. but they did a great job! very enjoyable film",1486080000,3,843,4.6644295302013425

5391327,4,B00A705IJG,"I liked this film. The acting was good, as was the general premise. My only reservation was that the violence was a little iffy. The N.

I actually enjoyed this movie more the second time around. It has a great balance of action, drama, humor, and storytelling. The characterization of and chemistry between the leads is such that it is hard not to become emotionally invested in them. Easily better than most Hollywood action movies I've seen in the past 10 years.",1454198400,2,458,4.810126582278481

A movie is to develope the characters of roles and make audiences feel and care for the persons in a movie, can't say an excellent movie, but enjoy it, no regreat to watch it, (spoiled alert!) final fighting scene is OK, with happy ending later.

5391381,4,B00A705IJG,"Secret reunion is a film about male bonding of literal opposites as two spies from North and South Korea begin the film through a cat and mouse games and turn partners by the end of the film. This is a great spy versus spy who both love their countries, we hardly get to see such movies as this theme has lost its favor.  Secret Reunion is a great spy film with some good stunts and smart story twists to make this a worthwhile watch.

Sung Ji-won (Gang Dong-won) and Lee Han-gyu (Song Kang-ho) are special agents for North and South Korea. They almost bump in to each other at a shootout  resulting from the at the very onset of the movie.
botched assassination of a defector from the South. Their life changes because of this. and years later they bump in to each other again.
Lee, runs a private detective agency now and he hires Sung because he thinks that he can be used to break the spy ring and Sung thinks he can break the Southern spy ring. There are many funny moments between the two men and they start discovering that they many things in common
The direction and the editing is both top notch and the chase scenes, hallmarks of great spy movies are truly top notch. The actors are great especially Kang Ho, who essays a role that could have easily been a joke. Sung as the cold assassin also acts very well and shows the right amount of balance. Loved it.",1398470400,,1368,4.3359375

Some insight of the South and North Korean differences and some social issues, as well. It has a little bit of every thing. I do recommend the movie. For those fan of the South Korean action movies, in particular, Kang-ho Song, I'd highly recommend ""Memories of a murder"".
