8058025,5,B00097E6UY,"This is a very good family movie, and children love it!  'Ragtime' (the horse) is simply adorable, and the dialogue is clean.  Adults may find it a bit cheesy, but as long as your kids like it, that's all that counts.",1451692800,,217,4.2682926829268295
8058026,5,B00097E6UY,I bought this movie and it is a wonderful movie for children and adults. It is so funny and the animals are so talented. The owner trainer Patty Fairchild did a wonderfully training her animals. It would be a shame to miss out on this movie.,1250380800,,241,4.260869565217392
8058027,3,B00097E6UY,This is a decent family film that had a lot of fluff.  Kids will love it adults not so much.  I wish i had known the animals in it would be talking because that is a pretty over used theme.  So kids will love it because it's kid oriented and parents can stand it.,1200441600,3,263,3.8333333333333335
