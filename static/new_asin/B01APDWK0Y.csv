7607669,1,B01APDWK0Y,"I've been a huge fan of Roman Atwood for many years...I remember watching his vlogs when he had a fraction of the audience that he has now. I use to work a job where I was miserable everyday, but watching his vlogs is what kept my spirits up, and watching he and his family grow was truly something I looked forward to every day.

When they announced they were doing a movie I was over the moon with excitement and even more excited that Roman would be directing it. When I finally got to watch it...I couldn't have been more disappointed. Trying super hard to mimick jackass with their introductions into the movie, showing pranks and only showing one reaction, and showing a mesh of their YouTube videos....terrible...obviously these days pranksters have to fake pranks to stay relavant, but these were so badly faked that I was almost insulted as a fan.

Roman is capable of so much more as well as vitaly and Dennis. I hope if they release another movie in the future that they really try and put out a quality product. I miss the super genuine feel of Romans material in general, you use to really get the sense that he and his family were super down to earth, it now all feels very fake and contrived.",1478044800,,1207,4.457013574660634
7607670,4,B01APDWK0Y,"My teenage son loves to watch Roman Atwoods videos on YouTube.  I've watched a few with him and found some of the pranks to be pretty funny so I decided to watch it with him.  I found some parts of this movie really hilarious, other parts were boring or not funny at all.  It seemed to me that the movie was kind of rushed to be put together.  It's definitely not a movie I would watch again.
I would have given this movie a lower star rating, but my son really enjoyed it.  He would have given 5 stars, while I would have given 3.  I'm not sure if it's because he is so much younger than me or because he is a loyal Roman Atwood fan, but he sure laughed at a lot more of the movie than I did.",1476316800,,693,3.879432624113475

They hyped this up for a year and I can honestly say this is by far the worst movie I have ever seen. This movie is not even close to Jackass.

7607805,1,B01APDWK0Y,"Part of the reason I hated this movie was my own fault. It was my fault that I trusted this man with my 10 year old son's mind, and it was my fault that I believed that his primary focus was to inspire others so that they could smile more. My son had became addicted to Roman's Vlog's. He watched the faithfully everyday; I even watched some of the videos with him, because he was so excited about them. I felt that this was safe entertainment for my son and somewhat of a family show since Roman's children were present in them. Honestly, my son watched them so much, that the Atwood's began to feel like family.  I'll never forget the day that I allowed my son to watch this horrific film. I was in the other room working on some business stuff when he yelled, ""OMG, the movie is out! Can I order it mom, please, please, please?"" I replied, wait, let me see what movie you're talking about. He said, ""it's Roman."" I replied, ""oh sure, go ahead."" In my mind, I was thinking, it's Roman  he's safe, I don't need to check. A few minutes later, I did walk out to look, because I was curious about the film myself. I couldn't believe the amount of sexual material that my son had been exposed to within just a few minutes of watching this film. I was so angry, not really at Roman, but at myself for not doing the research on the movie and checking the content before allowing my son to download it. I do not hate Roman, and again, this is my own fault for trusting his brand to be kid friendly. However, his Vlogs gave me no indication that his movie would be so perverted. I didn't like the movie based on what I saw, and I did make my son turn it off. I also apologized to my son for not checking the movie out first. I still think that the Atwood's are amazing people; they have made me smile 99% of the time, and this is just one thing I didn't like. That was bad parenting on my part. . .it truly was. I still love them, and it took a minute for me to allow my son to watch their Vlogs again, but they are still very much apart of this family but just with supervision.",1461369600,,2072,4.11358024691358

It is similar to the other Wide versions of pranks/stun movies just like the Dudesons and Jackass. They followed the same rhythm and i liked it, maybe people who are not familiar with those titles are the ones who are very disappointed by this movie. Although i feel as if they needed more reactions and more pranks. I know they added each pranksters own montages of their pranks in their channel but feel that it added their background to those who have no idea who they are, but boy did they made those hard-core fans of each of those pranksters mad. It isn't a bad movie i laughed and become anxious on behalf of the victims. 1st movie guys, shouldn't expect a whole lot, which is why they learn from it.

Examples: Framing a helpful hispanic man with breaking and entering; Setting up a black driver as a witness to a gangland-style murder, then threatening his life; Browbeating a group of mostly black actresses into swimming in a pool filled with diarrhea, then threatening their livelihood when they don't comply; Portraying a Chinese restaurant as a canine abattoir; Surrounding a gay man with a group of large men and accusing him of seducing one of their wives, threatening a beating. Notice a pattern? The creators are all straight, white, young men.

7607861,5,B01APDWK0Y,"The movie exceeds expectations considering this is their first movie.  The film is great length at about 90 minutes and the movie is almost nonstop action. Anyone who likes pranks,  Jackass, The Dudesons, or YouTube style humor will like it. My only complaint is the acting could be a little better, but it's definitely worth a watch.. .  Deserving of the R rating though,  I would not let kids watch it.",1459641600,4,404,4.647887323943662
7607862,5,B01APDWK0Y,"Movie made from regular people for regular people. This was very exciting, I was laughing all through it. If you love Roman you'll love this. So happy with how I spent my money!!!",1459641600,,179,4.454545454545454
7607863,3,B01APDWK0Y,"It could be that I don't fit the demographic for this movie, which could also explain the diversity of reviews thus far. There were a couple of good bits, some meh, and some that just appear to be mean spirited. Not what I expected from watching Roman's vlogs. I would not recommend it, I'm sorry to say.  Didn't make me want to Smile More. If you look at a considerable number of the 5 star ratings (particularly around or before the release date), the rater had not yet seen the movie. I don't know if that would have changed their review, but certainly there wasn't a basis for it.",1459641600,8,584,4.3577981651376145
7607864,1,B01APDWK0Y,"It feels like I just watched a YouTube prank compilation with poor editing and horrible acting. Just a bunch of doofs trying too hard to be the next Jackass guys and failed miserably. Set ups were lazy, transitions...well, what transitions? Almost every reaction was bland and boring. I was actually able to sit through this movie with a straight face. I fell asleep the first half and picked up where I left off the next morning.

Next time you decide to make an hour and a half long YouTube compilation of poor pranks and horrible reactions, just post it to youtube.",1459641600,5,568,4.623762376237623
7607865,3,B01APDWK0Y,"I'm definitely a fan of these guys on youtube, but most of the scenes in the movie were straight from their youtube channels. I wish there was more creativity with new pranks. I also thought the editors did a terrible job. I personally would not recommend the movie if you are a fan of the youtube channels. It will only make you wish they'd created something more original.",1459641600,2,374,4.514705882352941
7607866,5,B01APDWK0Y,ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES IVE EVER SEEN HANDS DOWN MUST SEE THE MOVIE,1459555200,,66,3.7857142857142856
7607867,2,B01APDWK0Y,"There were some funny parts, but there was some YouTube scenes from their channels as filler. There was really only 3 main good parts in the movie, if you even want to call it that. A good chunk was them just messing around with each other. It was an attempt to be Jackass, but failed. This movie does not even have any bloopers, or special features, which is another star gone. I regret the purchase.",1459555200,12,401,4.36
7607868,2,B01APDWK0Y,The acting was very bad. Why are studios getting low budget actors. They need to hire professional well paid actors for the pranks. Overall okay. Try to catch it in red box.,1459555200,,173,4.4375
7607869,1,B01APDWK0Y,"Horrible save your money, its so fake.",1459555200,2,38,4.571428571428571
7607870,1,B01APDWK0Y,"Huge fan of Roman, hated every minute of the movie, it was so obviously staged and fake, they are not good actors at all. Wasted $6, this movie really had the potential if they had stuck to their roots, maybe done some really cool original stuff, to fake, no DECENT reactions whatsoever!!",1459555200,3,288,4.5576923076923075
7607871,1,B01APDWK0Y,Completely Fake! I could not watch for more than 20min. These guys have lost all their credibility! Do not waste your time on this movie.,1459555200,2,137,4.52
7607872,1,B01APDWK0Y,"I had a lot of trouble sitting through this movie. It was just not funny and many of the pranks were offensive and seemed staged. It was cringe-worthy at best. The editing seemed really off too and the transitions between pranks were missing in action; it would have been better if there was some storyline or common thread. The key to a great prank is in the reactions - these did not seem genuine in the film and appear to be fleeting and cut away. I have seen their pranks on YouTube and Dennis seems like a really good guy - I have been hearing more and more though that Vitaly and Roman fake most of their pranks, which is disappointing.  I think pranks these days have gone too far away from making sure everyone at the end shares a laugh.  Some of the pranks in the movie feel downright mean and miss the mark of being funny. I get it that these guys are trying to be edgy but they often cross the line. The movie also felt too much like being back at junior high. (Even though this is likely their key demographic, still I don't think you can say these pranksters are the best role models for their audience.)  There is a lot of bathroom humor, violence and sexual content. I really wanted to like this, but felt much more disappointed than uplifted. There's a lot better content on YouTube.",1459555200,8,1299,4.337448559670782
7607873,1,B01APDWK0Y,The movie was very stale and did not really keep me interested. Do not buy its not good.,1459555200,2,88,3.9444444444444446
7607874,5,B01APDWK0Y,"We saw the movie at the premiere in Columbus, OH and could not have had a better time. We were seated in the balcony with all of Roman's friends and family. The movie was hilarious. And for those saying that the pranks were fake, I don't think that at all. Especially after listening to the Q and A session and them giving some background info on some of the pranks. Ordered the DVD from Amazon..can't wait to watch it again.",1459555200,8,425,4.325

8747979,3,B01APDWK0Y,"It's an Ok movie, not that great. There are also multiple sources that say a majority of the pranks and the victims are scripted, which is fine. I'd rather watch Jack Ass.",1526601600,,171,4.375
