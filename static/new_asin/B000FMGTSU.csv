8124636,1,B000FMGTSU,The quality of the DVD was so poor that it faded out completely then would come back very dard then fade out - quite useless unless one was only interested in listening to the music but that was not why I purchased this.  This DVD was a gift and of course caused me great embarrassment.  Nowhere in the offering did I see mentioned that it was ONLY in Spanish with no option for subtitles and that it was shipped from Argentina which took much longer than I had counted on.,1168387200,5,473,4.2444444444444445
8124637,1,B000FMGTSU,"This DVD is mostly interviews, with only about one-fourth music and dance. Big disappointment. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.",1160870400,8,131,5.6
8124638,1,B000FMGTSU,"My husband and I visited Buenos Aires in February and were captivated by the tango, both its passionate music and complicated dance steps.  We bought this video, hoping to see many experts dancing the tango.  Instead, this DVD had numerous interviews with musicians and instrumentals and vocals.  From beginning to end, it had less than five minutes of actual performers who were dancing the tango.",1160265600,12,398,5.092307692307692
