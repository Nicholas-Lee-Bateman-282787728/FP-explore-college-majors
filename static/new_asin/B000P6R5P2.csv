2813521,5,B000P6R5P2,"As usual, the History Channel puts out yet another great documentary. Lots of great stuff about the haunted spots in Hollywood! And no fake/reenacted ""ghosts"" in this one. Great stuff!",1239494400,2,184,5.166666666666667
2813522,5,B000P6R5P2,"The History Channel's Haunted Hollywood was just great.  I had stayed at The Georgian Hotel in Santa Monica, so especially loved the piece on some of its most famous guests.",1220313600,2,173,4.766666666666667

8189688,5,B000P6R5P2,"This is a fun series to watch especially around Halloween. Interesting ghost stories and filled with fun haunted facts! It's not HD quality and is from the early 2000's. Some (not all) have been burned on wrightable disks so they have generic sleeves as pictured (left) . Some have The original sleeve as pictured (right).All my disks have worked fine.
I wish History Channel still had documentaries like this. I have the entire collection and would recommend it!",1504137600,,463,4.948717948717949
8189689,4,B000P6R5P2,DVD was interesting but should have been longer than 50 mins.,1490572800,,61,4.636363636363637
8189690,1,B000P6R5P2,"This DVD is purely for entertainment value. It does speak to some of Haunted sensations of Hollywood but many facts are just plain wrong. Take for example the comments about the first Academy awards being at the Roosevelt Hotels ballroom.... That was not the case, it was in the second floor meeting room that overlooks Hollywood Boulvard. Also, some of the cemetery stories of ghosts being seen by many people at night..... That is interesting because the cemetery has been closed at night for a very long time.... even prior to when this produced. It's fun to watch though... you just can't take what they say as ""History"".",1484524800,,625,4.796296296296297

8189693,5,B000P6R5P2,"Oh I loved this edition! I have several of these in my dvd collection and this is one to definitely add to yours. Several celebrities are featured, most notably Marilyn Monroe, Rudolph Valentino and the black draped figure spotted at his crypt. Others are Clifton Webb, Virginia Rappe. The graveyard is Hollywood Forever Cemetery in Hollywood, one of the oldest in Southern Ca. I believe it was established in 1899. I have been there several times and it amazes me every time. Several Hotels are talked about as well and it's history. If you love the old Hollywood era like me, than this edition is a welcome one to your collection.",1405641600,,632,4.702702702702703
8189694,5,B000P6R5P2,"I was fortunate enough to book the part as the ghost of Clark Gable at the Georgian Hotel in Santa Monica. We had a great time filming, and the way that the crew made the black and white film of Fatty Arbunkle and me running up the steps to the hotel look old-time is awesome. I still get calls from friends telling me the show is on TV. It's a great show all around. A must see!

8189696,5,B000P6R5P2,"Of all the Haunted History series on DVD or TV by far this is the absolutely best episode of the series.  It is both the narration and how it is put together, going between old clips of the stars and relating the statements of those witnessing the paranormal with just enough tidbits of haunted locations to make any Hollywood tourist break out their maps and go looking for these obscure locations.  For those who didn't grow up in the days of the Hollywood studio empires, where the stars were employees of the studios and were not paid multi-million dollar fees for a movie, but done under contract,  I am, a big fan of this series, it is both educational and entertaining, much better than many of the so-called paranormal shows on cable today.  The series delves into normal everyday people experiencing abnormal extraordinary things in their lives, which adds to the mystery and interest.",1370649600,2,894,4.785714285714286
8189697,5,B000P6R5P2,I knew I would like this. Any thing about old Hollywood even haunted has always fascinated  me.so I knew I wanted it as I have watched it on history.,1317772800,,149,4.137931034482759
