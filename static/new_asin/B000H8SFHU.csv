8137637,3,B000H8SFHU,This is an adequate review of Charles Dickens life but a little on the boring side as the narrator is quite monotone. The autobiographical detail about the author is impressive but the format it is presented is a touch dull. The one excellent point of this product is along with the documentary there are two films; Oliver Twist (1933) and The Old Curiosity Shop (1934). For this reason alone it is worth buying. This is a good DVD for classroom use as it serves its purpose of teaching students about the man Charles Dicknes and his life. Also gives the opportunity to show two classic film versions of Dickens' stories.,1180483200,7,621,4.654545454545454
