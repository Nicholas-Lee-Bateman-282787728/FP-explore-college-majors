I press DVD-Rs on my Mac and they have no problems on any of my players, so it's not like DVD-Rs are inherently bad.

47571,4,0783224788,"THE HOUSE OF SEVEN GABLES (Joe May, 1940) is typical Golden era studio-bound Hollywood fare. This DVD release has the film in gorgeous black and white and very good sound quality, but no subtitles at all and no extras.
It is based on a classic story by Nathaniel Hawthorne. This tale of betrayal, time-defying love and revenge revolves around two brothers of very different character, one joyously romantic (the tall and early Vincent Price in his 6th film credit), one greedy and vile beyond belief (the tall and great George Sanders, of many a classic movie). Sanders, strangely, doesn't seem completely at ease with his part, maybe because the character he plays is quite one-dimensional, with no redeeming feature, exhibiting no charm or wit (Sanders' trademark roles have those two elements). It's Price who shines most here, his part requiring him to display a wide range of emotions, from unabashed romantic love to a doomed sense of fate, from sprightly young musician to revenge seeker to former convict in old age. One interesting side of the story is its psychanalytical use of the curse plaguing the Pyncheon family. The supporting actors are uniformly good, and the musical score is by Hubert J. Salter. 87 minutes of the best B-movie kind, from a time when actors had room to stretch and carry the films on their shoulders, without the help of special effects or fast editing.",1265846400,20,1390,4.919148936170213
47572,4,0783224788,"The 1940 theatrical version of THE HOUSE OF THE SEVEN GABLES bears little resemblance to Nathaniel Hawthorne's novel.

VHS art work depicts Vincent Price in a starring role. Although his was a main character, the pivotal role in this melodrama clearly belongs to Margaret Lindsay as Hepzibah Pyncheon. She's in the lion's share of scenes and is clearly most affected by events that are often beyond her control.

SYNOPSIS--
The seven-gabled house has been cursed since the 1600s, when Geoffrey Pyncheon caused the execution for witchcraft of an innocent man. Matthew Maule's property is usurped by Pyncheon; thus the origin of the famous curse.

In 1812, bad investments of Jaffrey Pyncheon (Sanders) bankrupt the family, so older brother Clifford and father Gerald (Emery) ally against him to sell the home. The three men quarrel. Later, the father changes his mind about selling. He and a disappointed Clifford shout at each other until the old man dies from a sudden seizure. Jaffrey, who saw what happened testifies in court that Clifford murdered their father. His brother is imprisoned for life.

With Clifford eliminated, Jaffrey believes the house is now his. Plans to search for treasure rumored hidden on the Pyncheon estate are thwarted at the will reading, when sole ownership is given to Cousin Hepzibah, who is also Clifford's fianc&eacute;e. She immediately banishes Jaffrey then resolutely waits, praying over the many years for her love's  release from prison.

Some two decades later, fate brings Clifford in contact with Matthew Maule (Foran), descendant of the first man to be wronged by a Pyncheon. They become fast friends and together plot revenge against Jaffrey.

47573,4,0783224788,"Vincent Price did not always do horror movies, but he was always a good actor and this film proves it. Price actually does not play the heavy in this film, that role falls to George Sanders who excels in a role where he deals out treachery. Price, Sanders and Margeret Lindsay all give outstanding performances. This may not be Vincent Price's best film, but it certainly ranks up there as one of his best performances. This is not a horror film, but it is a dark film that shows the impact greed can cause. The ending seems a little rushed, but it is still effective. There are no special effects and just simple sets, but the story and fantastic acting make this a great film for a wide range of viewers.",961459200,38,706,4.396946564885496

The school board did not think a BLACK 6th grade female could understand a book like this--later the truth came out--the 6th grade teacher had never read the book---you do the math. The school board was ordered to allow it and they had to get a college lit instructor to listen to and read my report. That Professor (whom I later took classes from), told the 6th grade teacher, school board to leave me alone and let me read any book. She wished her college students understood the book and Hawthorne! Testing later showed I could read at the college level.
