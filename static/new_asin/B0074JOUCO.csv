5054143,5,B0074JOUCO,The product came on time and in great condition. The movies themselves was worth getting for my son and I. Tracking the package takes alittle long because you have to wait for the systems to update but thats just a small shipping issue. Other than that I'm very happy with my purhase.,1341273600,,284,4.480769230769231
5054144,5,B0074JOUCO,"the planet hulk story is alittle silly. they tell you his blood will save the planet. he becomes a gladiator and sheds plenty of blood, and from this blood plants grow-but no one pays any attention to it. he fights a king, and a chick and beta ray bill. its well drawn, but the story isn't worth the time.

the iron man cartoon is definitely not worth the time. they try to show you an origin story but somehow leave out the creating of iron man. it takes almost an hour before iron man appears and when he does its one of the different suit variations. the fight sequences are awful and the plot doesnt get any better. not worth the time at all.",1341100800,,646,4.209677419354839
5054165,4,B0074JOUCO,In terms of value for the amount of movies and features that the collection has you won't find much better value. The actual quality of movies isn't quite up to par as the Iron Man movie isn't very good while Planet Hulk is ok. Dr Strange is the best of the bunch but the one with the least amount of features.,1434844800,,310,4.098360655737705

5054169,4,B0074JOUCO,"Animated superhero movies are always so hard to figure out concerning age appropriateness. Some sections may have been a little intense for my 5 yr old superhero lover. But, the movies are pretty good (Especially Dr. Strange).",1422057600,,226,5.135135135135135
5054170,5,B0074JOUCO,"Hulk, Iron Man and Strange on a 3 disc set is a DREAM Purchase.  These are Marvel's 3 Big Individual Hitters!  Action and Adventure are the focus of this genre and it lives up to the billing.",1409011200,,191,4.135135135135135

5054174,5,B0074JOUCO,"Yes, I am a superhero movie junkie and Marvel has done a nice job over the years of putting out animated and live action films to satisfy my wants. I had owned the Iron Man movie on DVD but neither the Planet Hulk or Dr Strange movies so when I saw a 3 movie deal I grabbed at it and figured I would just upgrade the Iron Man movie. The Iron Man and Dr Strange films are origin stories while the Hulk movie follows the Planet Hulk storyline (for those familiar with the comics). Now as I said I had owned the Iron Man movie but now Marvel bundled 3 movies, a couple of weeks later I saw a 5 movie bundle from Marvel...grrrrr. Marvel gets you to buy 1, then introduces a 2 movie pack (the Ultimate Avengers movies) and on and on.",1355011200,2,728,4.0625

8509968,3,B0074JOUCO,"Not the most high quality animation, (it is soft and looks cheap) but both Doctor Strange and Planet Hulk are solid and tell the story well and in entertaining fashion. The Invincible Iron Man is a pretty tough watch, though. Way over-use of 3D animation to cut corners.",1476057600,,270,4.645833333333333
