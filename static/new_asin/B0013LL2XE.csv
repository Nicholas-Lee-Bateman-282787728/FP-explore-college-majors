3116966,4,B0013LL2XE,"If you are a fan of the ""oldies,"" whether Sinatra, Kelly, dance, songs or musicals, you need this collection.  They were more innocent times (not necessarily better) and a bunch of sailors on the make in New York city  (""On the Town"") was not cause for concern but rather FUN to be had.",1213574400,,286,4.377358490566038
3116967,1,B0013LL2XE,"While the clarity and color and music still holds up and is both
singable and enjoyable, the dialogue is severly dated and the acting
not what one remembers from seeing it the first time around. Actually it's
rather sad. Movies like these are best left to memory.",1213315200,,263,4.617021276595745
3116968,4,B0013LL2XE,"This is a great set.  All three films are wonderful examples of MGM at it's finest.  The only reservation I have is that the DVD set leaves you wanting more.  These films just beg to be produced in the same ""Night at the Movies"" style as the Esther Williams Collection, with newsreels, cartoons, trailers and the like.  Buy it while you can, however, because the low price just MUST be an error!",1210723200,4,395,4.444444444444445
3116969,1,B0013LL2XE,"The one star is not for the movies, but as a warning to those who have read the decriptions of the extras, and are expecting the full documentary
""When The Lion Roars"". Hang onto your 3-vhs boxed sets, because when you open the DVD case, you discover that there is only an ""excerpt"" from the this long awaited documentary. Maybe sometime soon we'll get the whole
shelang, but not now.",1209513600,34,384,4.5
3116970,5,B0013LL2XE,"All three of these DVDs have been released previously; however, this new boxed set houses a few new mildly interesting ""extras"" to be found in the Special Features.  These three films are all big colorful MGM musicals, but none are in Widescreen because that particular aspect:ratio was not ""invented"" until 1954.  However, they LOOK spectacular anyway!

""Anchors Aweigh"" (1945) is a winning musical about two sailors on shore leave in search of a ""dame"".  This musical's only flaw is it is a bit too long, as it has everything but the kitchen sink thrown in it, including a whole lot (too much) of Jose Iturbi, who must have been ""quite something"" in 1945 (but not now)!  However, it is thoroughly entertaining for both adults and children, the latter, due to a lengthy sequence in the middle of the film that pairs live action (Gene Kelly dancing) with animation.  Note, this was over 40 years BEFORE ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and 20 years before ""Mary Poppins"".
Both Sinatra and Kelly are excellent and Sinatra proves he can DANCE with the greatest of them! (4 1/2 out of 5 stars)

""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" (1949) is not quite as entertaining as ""Anchors Aweigh"".  It less colorful and has a weaker plot, but the songs and dancing are still top-notch!  This is the film where Sinatra REALLY proves he can DANCE as he and Kelly charge through a song in striped suits halfway through the film.  Songs like ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"", ""Strictly USA"", ""The Right Girl For Me"", and ""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg"" add to the fun of this film. (3 1/2 out of 5 stars)

""On the Town"" (1949)  Simply, one of the greatest musicals ever made!  This was the FIRST musical in film history to be filmed ON LOCATION, and what a location: NEW YORK CITY CIRCA 1949!  If the plot sounds familiar (THREE sailors on shore leave in search of a ""dame""), the musical numbers and the thrill of the Big Apple send this one right OUT of the ballpark!
Co-starring Jules Munshin, Vera-Ellen, Betty Garrett, and Ann Miller, with some of the musical sequences composed by Leonard Bernstein, and the great theme song, ""New York, New York"" (""a helluva town, the Bronx is Up and the Battery Down..."", not the Sinatra smash-hit song, which came way later - 1979), ""On the Town"" is everything a musical could and should be!
(5 out of 5 stars)

Overall rating for this DVD box set, due to the considerable strengths of ""Anchors Aweigh"" and ""On the Town"": 5 out of 5 stars!",1204156800,58,2445,4.575688073394495
3116971,5,B0013LL2XE,"Warner is releasing several DVD sets featuring Frank Sinatra on the same day. This set features films starring Sinatra and Gene Kelly. The following is from the Warner Home Video press release:

The Frank Sinatra & Gene Kelly Collection features:

On the Town (1949) - Three sailors on leave in New York City have just 24 hours to take in the sights and find romance. The first musical to shoot on location, this was directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donan.

Take Me Out To The Ballgame (1949) - Sinatra and Kelly work in vaudeville in the winter and play baseball for The Wolves in the summer. A new team manager (Esther Williams) comes along and has opposite effects on the guys. Betty Garrett supplies additional comic relief.

Anchors Aweigh (1945) - A kind of dry run for ""On the Town"", this time sailors Sinatra and Kelly are on leave in Los Angeles, which draws their adventures into the realm of Hollywood. The plot is just a little too cute, which was a problem with MGM musicals starting around this time.

Special features include interviews with William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, outtakes, and ""When the Lion Roars"" MGM documentary.

On The Town is already on DVD and in the Gene Kelly DVD Collection. The other two films were put out on DVD in 2000, thus none of these films is new to DVD.",1202601600,15,1303,4.570815450643777

3117074,5,B0013LL2XE,"I LOVE these movies. My all time favorite is ""Anchors Aweigh"". The other two were very good as well. They couldn't have been cast better. Amazing!!
 Frank Sinatra has a great voice and plays a very funny character. Gene Kelly can dance, and plays a more serious character. All in all, great movies!!!!!",1429056000,,302,4.69811320754717

3117077,5,B0013LL2XE,"These are classic! I've wanted to update my VHS tapes for a long time. These are just the right price and beautifully transferred to DVD. I will enjoy them a long time.

And I have no idea why Frank Sinatra was portrayed as the side kick, other than being a bit underweight. :-) He was adorable at that age. Gene Kelly is a great dancer, but I always preferred Fred Astaire. Too bad he and Frankie weren't of an age.

Still, I can't deny it... Kelly and Sinatra made some great movies together.",1417132800,,494,4.301075268817204

Sinatra and Kelly have great chemistry, and maybe thats why I loved these movies so. Especially in Anchors Aweigh. Youll find in these movies Frankie singing, Gene dancing. What you expect youll see!

3117116,5,B0013LL2XE,This is great entertainment if you like dancing musicals from the 1940's and 1950's. The acting is usually a little corny but the dancing and the music scenes are very much of the time period. Good family fun.,1383436800,,209,4.526315789473684

3117121,3,B0013LL2XE,"Pleasant entertainment. Too light to get into details since they would sound negative, but one can see how Sinatra's film career was sliding - until The Man With The Golden Arm.

3117123,5,B0013LL2XE,This collection is worth it for On The Town and Take Me Out to the Ballgame.  On the town was my first introduction to both stars and I've been looking for this movie every since.  It's true that in all 3 movie they play basically the same character but they do it with such style you really don't care.  If you're a fan of either or both you need this collection.,1359331200,,364,4.098591549295775

Anchors Away and On the Town both work perfectly, but the other causes my DVD player to not respond and also makes my TV shut off completely.",1347148800,,299,4.245614035087719
3117160,4,B0013LL2XE,"I enjoyed this musical collection. Sinatra and Kelly made a good duo.  Supporting casts of Betty Garrett, Ann Miller, Vera Ellen, Jules Munshin, Ester Williams and Kathryn Grayson made all three movies special.  Really enjoyed the energy and talents of Betty Garrett and Jules Munshin. Gene Kelly is still the consummate dancer/singer. These movies are rarely broadcasted so they were a great addition to my classic movie collection.",1343088000,,433,5.352941176470588

3117204,5,B0013LL2XE,"The Voice and Mr. Kelly.  What more is there to review? :)  It's too hard to pick a favorite out of this collection.  They both sing, Frank just a little better than Gene.  They both dance, Gene just a little better than Frank.  The pair together?  Unstoppable!  Classic songs sung by the greats and performed in memorable dance routines.

Putting the movies together in 1 box step was genius.  It's a great collection of DVDs.  No more waiting for any of the movies to come on TCM late at night and then not being able to stay up to watch them!",1300924800,,545,4.306930693069307

3117206,5,B0013LL2XE,"Did not realize how entertaining and enjoyable the musicals of my parents generation are. So glad they were able to preserve these 1940's flims, the ""live-action"" dancing with Mr. Kelly and animated Jerry mouse(from Tom & Jerry cartoons)surpasses any animation done today -- totally flawless. Highly recommended for all ages.",1284163200,,325,5.52
3117207,4,B0013LL2XE,"Though Sinatra gets first billing on the box, Kelly has at least as much to do with the success of the three movies as does Young Blue Eyes (as he was then).  ""Anchors Aweigh,"" released while World War II was still raging, finds the pair playing sailor buddies, the smooth-talking and worldly-wise Joe Brady (Kelly) and the shy, naive Clarence ""Brooklyn"" Doolittle (Sinatra), who, having just been decorated, are given four days' leave in Los Angeles.  Joe plans to look up a girl he knows, and Clarence asks to tag along in hopes of picking up some pointers, but then they get involved with an eight-year-old orphan boy, Donald Martin (Dean Stockwell), who has decided he wants to join the Navy (his father was in it) and won't tell the police his name and address.  This in turn gets them acquainted with Donald's pretty aunt and guardian, aspiring singer Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson), and Clarence rashly promises her an audition with bandleader Jose Iturbi.  Of course he can't deliver, and meanwhile Joe is falling for her and feels like a heel because he thinks Clarence is in love with her himself.  This dance-filled classic has the distinction of having furnished no less than three clips for the ""That's Entertainment!"" compilations: Sinatra and Kelly's number in the servicemen's hospitality dorm, Kelly's dance with the animated Jerry the Mouse, and his ""Soundstage Fantasy"" with Grayson.

Four years later, Kelly and Sinatra teamed again, not once, but twice, and both times with Jules Munshin.  In ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game,"" for which Kelly provided the story, they're teammates on the champion Wolves around 1904: Sinatra is second baseman Dennis Ryan, Kelly is shortstop Eddie O'Brien, and Munshin is Nat Goldberg.  During the baseball season the trio make up the unstoppable team of ""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg,"" which has put out every batter they've faced; during the winter O'Brien & Ryan, so billed, are song-and-dance men on the vaudeville circuit.  When the team is inherited by one K. C. Higgins (who turns out to be Kathryn Catherine Higgins (Esther Williams), and a true ball fan), Ryan falls hard, but O'Brien has his own ideas about how an owner should behave.  What's worse, an unsavory gambler (Edward Arnold) means to put the Wolves out of the running for the Series, and he has a plan to do it by appealing to Eddie's dreams of stage stardom.

""On the Town"" finds the threesome once again playing gobs, this time loose in New York on a 24-hour liberty (Kelly co-directed).  Gabe (Kelly), Chip (Sinatra), and Ozzie (Munshin) are just looking for fun, but first Ozzie finds himself claimed by Claire Huddeson (Ann Miller), an anthropology fan who thinks he's a ringer for Pithecanthropus Erectus; then Chip gets entangled with aggressive lady cabdriver Brunnhilde Eszterhazy (Betty Garrett); and meanwhile Gabe has fallen--with a crash--for Miss Turnstiles, Ivy Smith (Vera-Ellen), who's not only a wannabe dancer but turns out to have come from the same Midwestern town as himself.  This was the first musical to be extensively filmed on location rather than a back lot; the ""New York, New York"" number is full of shots of famous sights.

Both stars have a quiet charm that adds immeasurably to the success of the films,
and Sinatra, though in his 30's when they were made, is a convincing naif in all of them.  He's also surprisingly light on his feet, though of course Kelly is better.  Though perhaps not among the best-known examples of MGM's large crop of musicals, these are still highly enjoyable and well worth your time, especially if you're a fan of Kelly's lively, athletic style.",1283558400,,3630,4.916530278232406

3117248,5,B0013LL2XE,"What can you say when you put two future icons of their respective fields together in three films? Dynamite. You can feel the chemistry and see the genuine respect they had for each other. They also seemed to bring each up in their weaker areas. Gene never liked his voice, but his sweet Irish tenor fit in fine most of the time. Frank once said that he would have been a nobody in the movies if Gene hadn't taught him how to dance. (His dancing improved considerably with each of these movies.)

Although he was billed third (huh?) ""Anchors Aweigh"" was Gene's film (he had the Oscar nomination to prove it.) There's lots for the Gene fan to enjoy here: the sexy phone call to Lola, Gene ""playing"" piano during ""If You Knew Susie,"" the Jerry dance, the glorious two minutes we get to see what those dancer's legs really looked like. But the coolest part is the fantasy on the movie set, where he brandishes a sword, leaps atop a castle and swings across it on a curtain, slides down a fireman's pole, and oh yeah, tap dances a tango. This is my favorite solo dance of his (second overall only to the ""An American In Paris"" ballet.) Frank's ""I Fall In Love Too Easily"" will put a lump in your throat. I have this one on VHS as well, and darn near wore it out trying to get to the good stuff.

""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" is certainly the weakest of the bunch, but it's entertaining nevertheless. ""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg"" will make you smile. Watch Gene as he leapfrogs up to the balcony to woo Esther Williams. At first ""The Hat My Father Wore"" seems like just a nice tip of the hat to Gene's Irish heritage. Be sure to watch the end, but do not, I repeat, do NOT attempt this at home as Gene tap dances on one foot with his other leg in the air. This DVD has two nice deleted scenes: the ""Baby Doll"" dance with Gene and Esther, and Sinatra's ""Boys and Girls Like You and Me"" (supposedly the song was too slow.)

What can be said about ""On the Town?"" It's a masterpiece for sure. Nobody really stands out because everyone is great in it. Its pace is frenetic for sure (especially compared to the somewhat draggy ""Anchors Aweigh."" I especially love the part where Frank throws his guidebook off the Empire State Building.

There should have been several more collaborations, but sadly it wasn't to be. But this collection will live on long after we're all gone.",1220659200,,2366,4.370454545454545

""They Did It There Way!!""What great music they had in those Films of thier""s. Especially in ""Anchor's Aweigh"" - I was a young Teenager on leave before going overseas when this Movie came out, and I took my Girl to see it!!!When ever I heard any of the Songs on the Armed Forces Radio it would bring back some great memories of Home,Family,and my Girl Friend
Just as it doe's when I See The Movie/Or Hear the music now!!

That was the Big thing about the Musicals of the 40's Thru the 60's,you came out whistling one of the Songs from the Movie..And those songs are everlasting!!

shelang, but not now.",1209513600,34,384,4.5
3351467,5,B0013LL2XE,"All three of these DVDs have been released previously; however, this new boxed set houses a few new mildly interesting ""extras"" to be found in the Special Features.  These three films are all big colorful MGM musicals, but none are in Widescreen because that particular aspect:ratio was not ""invented"" until 1954.  However, they LOOK spectacular anyway!

""Anchors Aweigh"" (1945) is a winning musical about two sailors on shore leave in search of a ""dame"".  This musical's only flaw is it is a bit too long, as it has everything but the kitchen sink thrown in it, including a whole lot (too much) of Jose Iturbi, who must have been ""quite something"" in 1945 (but not now)!  However, it is thoroughly entertaining for both adults and children, the latter, due to a lengthy sequence in the middle of the film that pairs live action (Gene Kelly dancing) with animation.  Note, this was over 40 years BEFORE ""Who Framed Roger Rabbit"" and 20 years before ""Mary Poppins"".
Both Sinatra and Kelly are excellent and Sinatra proves he can DANCE with the greatest of them! (4 1/2 out of 5 stars)

""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" (1949) is not quite as entertaining as ""Anchors Aweigh"".  It less colorful and has a weaker plot, but the songs and dancing are still top-notch!  This is the film where Sinatra REALLY proves he can DANCE as he and Kelly charge through a song in striped suits halfway through the film.  Songs like ""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"", ""Strictly USA"", ""The Right Girl For Me"", and ""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg"" add to the fun of this film. (3 1/2 out of 5 stars)

""On the Town"" (1949)  Simply, one of the greatest musicals ever made!  This was the FIRST musical in film history to be filmed ON LOCATION, and what a location: NEW YORK CITY CIRCA 1949!  If the plot sounds familiar (THREE sailors on shore leave in search of a ""dame""), the musical numbers and the thrill of the Big Apple send this one right OUT of the ballpark!
Co-starring Jules Munshin, Vera-Ellen, Betty Garrett, and Ann Miller, with some of the musical sequences composed by Leonard Bernstein, and the great theme song, ""New York, New York"" (""a helluva town, the Bronx is Up and the Battery Down..."", not the Sinatra smash-hit song, which came way later - 1979), ""On the Town"" is everything a musical could and should be!
(5 out of 5 stars)

Overall rating for this DVD box set, due to the considerable strengths of ""Anchors Aweigh"" and ""On the Town"": 5 out of 5 stars!",1204156800,58,2445,4.575688073394495
3351468,5,B0013LL2XE,"Warner is releasing several DVD sets featuring Frank Sinatra on the same day. This set features films starring Sinatra and Gene Kelly. The following is from the Warner Home Video press release:

The Frank Sinatra & Gene Kelly Collection features:

On the Town (1949) - Three sailors on leave in New York City have just 24 hours to take in the sights and find romance. The first musical to shoot on location, this was directed by Gene Kelly and Stanley Donan.

Take Me Out To The Ballgame (1949) - Sinatra and Kelly work in vaudeville in the winter and play baseball for The Wolves in the summer. A new team manager (Esther Williams) comes along and has opposite effects on the guys. Betty Garrett supplies additional comic relief.

Anchors Aweigh (1945) - A kind of dry run for ""On the Town"", this time sailors Sinatra and Kelly are on leave in Los Angeles, which draws their adventures into the realm of Hollywood. The plot is just a little too cute, which was a problem with MGM musicals starting around this time.

Special features include interviews with William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, outtakes, and ""When the Lion Roars"" MGM documentary.

On The Town is already on DVD and in the Gene Kelly DVD Collection. The other two films were put out on DVD in 2000, thus none of these films is new to DVD.",1202601600,15,1303,4.570815450643777

And I have no idea why Frank Sinatra was portrayed as the side kick, other than being a bit underweight. :-) He was adorable at that age. Gene Kelly is a great dancer, but I always preferred Fred Astaire. Too bad he and Frankie weren't of an age.

Supporting casts of Betty Garrett, Ann Miller, Vera Ellen, Jules Munshin, Ester Williams and Kathryn Grayson made all three movies special.  Really enjoyed the energy and talents of Betty Garrett and Jules Munshin. Gene Kelly is still the consummate dancer/singer.

They both dance, Gene just a little better than Frank.  The pair together?  Unstoppable!  Classic songs sung by the greats and performed in memorable dance routines.

3351703,5,B0013LL2XE,"Did not realize how entertaining and enjoyable the musicals of my parents generation are. So glad they were able to preserve these 1940's flims, the ""live-action"" dancing with Mr. Kelly and animated Jerry mouse(from Tom & Jerry cartoons)surpasses any animation done today -- totally flawless. Highly recommended for all ages.",1284163200,,325,5.52
3351704,4,B0013LL2XE,"Though Sinatra gets first billing on the box, Kelly has at least as much to do with the success of the three movies as does Young Blue Eyes (as he was then).  ""Anchors Aweigh,"" released while World War II was still raging, finds the pair playing sailor buddies, the smooth-talking and worldly-wise Joe Brady (Kelly) and the shy, naive Clarence ""Brooklyn"" Doolittle (Sinatra), who, having just been decorated, are given four days' leave in Los Angeles.  Joe plans to look up a girl he knows, and Clarence asks to tag along in hopes of picking up some pointers, but then they get involved with an eight-year-old orphan boy, Donald Martin (Dean Stockwell), who has decided he wants to join the Navy (his father was in it) and won't tell the police his name and address.  This in turn gets them acquainted with Donald's pretty aunt and guardian, aspiring singer Susan Abbott (Kathryn Grayson), and Clarence rashly promises her an audition with bandleader Jose Iturbi.  Of course he can't deliver, and meanwhile Joe is falling for her and feels like a heel because he thinks Clarence is in love with her himself.  This dance-filled classic has the distinction of having furnished no less than three clips for the ""That's Entertainment!"" compilations: Sinatra and Kelly's number in the servicemen's hospitality dorm, Kelly's dance with the animated Jerry the Mouse, and his ""Soundstage Fantasy"" with Grayson.

Four years later, Kelly and Sinatra teamed again, not once, but twice, and both times with Jules Munshin.  In ""Take Me Out to the Ball Game,"" for which Kelly provided the story, they're teammates on the champion Wolves around 1904: Sinatra is second baseman Dennis Ryan, Kelly is shortstop Eddie O'Brien, and Munshin is Nat Goldberg.  During the baseball season the trio make up the unstoppable team of ""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg,"" which has put out every batter they've faced; during the winter O'Brien & Ryan, so billed, are song-and-dance men on the vaudeville circuit.  When the team is inherited by one K. C. Higgins (who turns out to be Kathryn Catherine Higgins (Esther Williams), and a true ball fan), Ryan falls hard, but O'Brien has his own ideas about how an owner should behave.  What's worse, an unsavory gambler (Edward Arnold) means to put the Wolves out of the running for the Series, and he has a plan to do it by appealing to Eddie's dreams of stage stardom.

""On the Town"" finds the threesome once again playing gobs, this time loose in New York on a 24-hour liberty (Kelly co-directed).  Gabe (Kelly), Chip (Sinatra), and Ozzie (Munshin) are just looking for fun, but first Ozzie finds himself claimed by Claire Huddeson (Ann Miller), an anthropology fan who thinks he's a ringer for Pithecanthropus Erectus; then Chip gets entangled with aggressive lady cabdriver Brunnhilde Eszterhazy (Betty Garrett); and meanwhile Gabe has fallen--with a crash--for Miss Turnstiles, Ivy Smith (Vera-Ellen), who's not only a wannabe dancer but turns out to have come from the same Midwestern town as himself.  This was the first musical to be extensively filmed on location rather than a back lot; the ""New York, New York"" number is full of shots of famous sights.

Both stars have a quiet charm that adds immeasurably to the success of the films,
and Sinatra, though in his 30's when they were made, is a convincing naif in all of them.  He's also surprisingly light on his feet, though of course Kelly is better.  Though perhaps not among the best-known examples of MGM's large crop of musicals, these are still highly enjoyable and well worth your time, especially if you're a fan of Kelly's lively, athletic style.",1283558400,,3630,4.916530278232406

You can feel the chemistry and see the genuine respect they had for each other. They also seemed to bring each up in their weaker areas. Gene never liked his voice, but his sweet Irish tenor fit in fine most of the time. Frank once said that he would have been a nobody in the movies if Gene hadn't taught him how to dance. (His dancing improved considerably with each of these movies.)

Although he was billed third (huh?) ""Anchors Aweigh"" was Gene's film (he had the Oscar nomination to prove it.) There's lots for the Gene fan to enjoy here: the sexy phone call to Lola, Gene ""playing"" piano during ""If You Knew Susie,"" the Jerry dance, the glorious two minutes we get to see what those dancer's legs really looked like. But the coolest part is the fantasy on the movie set, where he brandishes a sword, leaps atop a castle and swings across it on a curtain, slides down a fireman's pole, and oh yeah, tap dances a tango. This is my favorite solo dance of his (second overall only to the ""An American In Paris"" ballet.) Frank's ""I Fall In Love Too Easily"" will put a lump in your throat. I have this one on VHS as well, and darn near wore it out trying to get to the good stuff.

""Take Me Out to the Ballgame"" is certainly the weakest of the bunch, but it's entertaining nevertheless. ""O'Brien to Ryan to Goldberg"" will make you smile. Watch Gene as he leapfrogs up to the balcony to woo Esther Williams. At first ""The Hat My Father Wore"" seems like just a nice tip of the hat to Gene's Irish heritage. Be sure to watch the end, but do not, I repeat, do NOT attempt this at home as Gene tap dances on one foot with his other leg in the air. This DVD has two nice deleted scenes: the ""Baby Doll"" dance with Gene and Esther, and Sinatra's ""Boys and Girls Like You and Me"" (supposedly the song was too slow.)

What can be said about ""On the Town?"" It's a masterpiece for sure. Nobody really stands out because everyone is great in it. Its pace is frenetic for sure (especially compared to the somewhat draggy ""Anchors Aweigh."" I especially love the part where Frank throws his guidebook off the Empire State Building.

There should have been several more collaborations, but sadly it wasn't to be. But this collection will live on long after we're all gone.",1220659200,,2366,4.370454545454545

""They Did It There Way!!""What great music they had in those Films of thier""s. Especially in ""Anchor's Aweigh"" - I was a young Teenager on leave before going overseas when this Movie came out, and I took my Girl to see it!!!When ever I heard any of the Songs on the Armed Forces Radio it would bring back some great memories of Home,Family,and my Girl Friend
Just as it doe's when I See The Movie/Or Hear the music now!!

That was the Big thing about the Musicals of the 40's Thru the 60's,you came out whistling one of the Songs from the Movie..And those songs are everlasting!!

8251937,5,B0013LL2XE,"Perhaps best remembered as an early vehicle for Frank Sinatra, ""On the Town"" is, despite its evisceration by a Hollywood production company that left only three of Leonard Bernstein's original numbers, one of the silver screen's most vibrant musicals.  The star of the film is neither Sinatra nor co-director Gene Kelley but the city of New York, which springs to life with the energy of the three randy sailors who hit its streets, hungry for new adventure and, along with it, new loves.

Anyone who has seen ""La La Land"" will recognize in ""On the Town"" a far more realistic musical, one which has more than a single, carefully choreographed uncut dance scene between the leading lady and her man.  In many respects, the entire film is a musical tone poem to the city, which is done in a single take encompassing the two days and one night of the three principals and their female loves.  The camera remains faithful to the action of Bernstein's score, which in turn is served by the book of Comden and Green, with both subservient to the preservation of the energy of America's most celebrated city over the distractions of story and clichd romance.

In foregrounding the life of the New World's most important and alive city, the film constructs a film-within-a-film, with the three male leads watching their own story--or the one that we have just seen--close to the end of their sojourn in city.  Finally, the movie comes full circle by repeating the musical number of the opening but with the variation of showing us three different sailors in a number that suggests the ongoing, ever renewing life of  the city whose heart never sleeps.

The final print was too much ""dumbed-down Hollywood"" for Bernstein, who boycotted the movie.  And the removal of Bernstein's influential ""Some Other Time""--which became a song performed repeatedly by pianist Bill Evans, inspiring the seminal jazz pianist's ""Peace Piece"" as well as the modes forming the basis of Miles Davis' ""Kind of Blue""--would seem a most unfortunate decision.  Nevertheless, ""On the Town"" is one of the greatest and most unique musicals to hit the big screen.  In placing  character over story, it brings us three proactive women who would be seen as progressive even by today's standards, almost 80 years later.  Yet it never loses sight of its most vibrant character: the always fascinating, alive and changing New York City, whose heart proves bigger than that of any of the individual characters associated with the film and its making.

Although ""Singin' in the Rain"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"" will continue to be my movies of choice for young viewers who don't like film musicals, ""On the Town"" is my new personal favorite.  Like the town, this is a movie musical that has--in the words of a composition and an entire album by vibist Milt Jackson--""plenty, plenty soul.""&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plenty-Plenty-Soul/dp/B000002I4J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plenty, Plenty Soul</a>",1514764800,,2998,5.139917695473251
