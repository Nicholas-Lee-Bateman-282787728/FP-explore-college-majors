7801983,1,0967901901,"I just finished watching this video, Innkeeping: the Innside Story. I was disappointed that it did not go into any detail on how to run an Inn. I was ready with notepad in hand to crib information on taking reservations, dealing with difficult guests, best accounting software to use, staff hiring pactices, etc. There was precious little substance and I came away with no notes.

 The video mentioned that going to the PAII Association web site would be where I could find the information I needed. The back of the video states that it contains the ""resources that will increase your chances of success"". I have yet to trip over a single resource other than the PAII web address that keeps all the pertinent information hidden away for members only.

 On the technical side, it is an amature production with poor lighting, muffled sound and grade school graphics.",1090800000,2,864,4.8175675675675675
