Whatever ""hardcore"" movies you think you have seen about poverty, urban blight, prisons, police brutality, drugs, prostitution, homelessness, etc., this takes 'em all, because it's Brazil, and Brazil very much in the raw.  This movie will change you.  Now, this dvd is not Pixote, it's a docudrama based on the fate of the little boy (a non-actor) who was discovered by Babenco and starred in Pixote.  Watch this one after you watch Pixote and you will see how little Babenco's film fudges the dire reality of Sao Paolo's slum life.  Not for the faint-hearted!  (Neither is Pixote.)  If both films don't make you weep, then I wouldn't want to be on a life raft with you in shark infested waters.",1394928000,2,831,4.7622377622377625
