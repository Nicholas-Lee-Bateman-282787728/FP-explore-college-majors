Beauty is foaled on the Evans farm with Joe (Mark Lester), the farmer's young son, standing by, and is given to Joe to be his own; as the young stallion grows, it's Joe who takes the primary role in training him.  But Evans is an independent farmer, not a tenant, and when he gets in trouble with the bank, there's no one to insure that he keeps his land or his stock; Beauty is sold for the debt along with everyone else.  Joe swears to get him back one day, but the road to that goal is hard.  Beauty falls into the hands of a young wastrel who is killed in a fall from his dogcart, is stolen by an Irish tinker who rides him in a stake race, then abandoned, picked up by horse traders, and taken to the Continent to be sold to a small circus.  From there he goes on to become a cavalry horse in India (not very likely: Rudyard Kipling tells us that most of the horses in that service came from Australia) and a coal-merchant's drudge.  Despite his changes in fortune, there's very little sense of engagement--I didn't feel a lot of sympathy for his situation--and nothing of the horsy friendships Sewell gives him (no Ginger or Merrylegs, for example).  Even the owners who don't treat him right seem less malicious than merely uncaring.  The sense of place is good--costumes and props do give an authentic picture of Victorian England--but if you want a film adaptation of the novel, you'll be much better off with the one that was made 23 years later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Beauty/dp/B00002E229/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Beauty</a>.

252586,5,6300216306,"The story of Black Beauty has been told many times, but none as well as this version. The photography is outstandingly beautiful from start to finish. The filming was done in Ireland and Spain, both providing beautiful backdrops. The musical score is superb, composed by Lionel Bart, who wrote the music for Oliver!. The acting is very well done by a cast of mostly unknown actors, with the exceptions of Mark Lester as Joe Evans, Black Beauty's original owner, and Walter Slezak, owner of the circus where Black Beauty resides for awhile. This is the sort of film that makes the viewer want to start it again as soon as it finishes. This film is completely suitable for family viewing, for people of all ages. I highly recommend it.",1196467200,,733,4.689922480620155
252587,2,6300216306,"There have been several versions of Black Beauty produced for the cinema and for television. One of the weakest versions is the 1971 British production, which focuses much more on its parade of human characters than it does the horse. In the book and several of the movie versions, we get to know Beauty. We feel what he feels, and we understand what he is thinking as he passes from owner to owner. Beauty goes from a loving, happy family and life on an English farm with a little boy (Mark Lester) who loves him, to the cruel hands of the local land baron (Patrick Mower). Then he's stolen by Gypsy stereotypes, shipped across the continent, sold to a circus, and gifted to a gentleman who in turn gives the horse to his daughter. The daughter presents Beauty to her lover, who's a soldier headed for India. When the young man is killed in battle, Beauty is shipped back to England, where he goes to work in a coal mine. Instead of the people in the story being the thread woven through the horse's life, in this version it is just the opposite. While a horse called Ginger is mentioned in passing, the colorful equine characters in Beauty's orbit - most notably, Merrylegs - are all excised.

Adding insult to injury, the filmmakers made precious little attempt to match the various horses who portrayed Beauty throughout the years. Different shades, different builds, and even completely different breeds were used interchangeably. To a horse-lover, this is on par with a director casting Jack Nicholson, Jackie Chan, and Jacqueline Bisset in the same role and expecting the audience not to notice. The only constant was the extremely shoddy-looking fake star painted on the horse's forehead.

252588,5,6300216306,"This is, quite simply, the best film version of Anna Sewell's classic novel about the adventures and misadventures of a beautiful horse when he gets seperated from his original owner. Mark Lester(of OLIVER! fame) stars as the young boy who searches desperately for his beloved horse. A gentel, international retelling of the timeless story, and fairly faithful to its source, this version can hold its own against the later, much praised 1994 filmization.",974160000,10,455,5.2465753424657535

252809,2,6300216306,"I added this movie to my watchlist and was so excited to watch it, but it's not the correct version shown. It's the old and boring version.  The version I wanted to see is directed by Caroline Thompson and was released in 1994.  Alan Cumming provides the voice of Black Beauty, Sean Bean plays Farmer Grey and Jim Carter from Downton Abbey plays John Manly.

Growing up, one of my favorite movies was Black Beauty.  Even now, the music (composed by Danny Elfman) is still one of my favorite movie scores.  The soundtrack is impossible to find for some reason, but if you can find it I highly recommend it.

Anyway, the 1994 version is so much better, and the music done by Danny Elfman is, in my opinion, some of his best work.  It's a heart-warming story, I highly recommend the Caroline Thompson version over this version.

The main character in Black Beauty is Black Beauty himself, as anyone familiar with the book knows.  This film seems to revolve around fighting, violence, superfluous kissing scenes and people behaving ridiculously.  I have a hard time believing that the director and producer  of this poor production took the time to actually read the book.  Unable to fathom anyone giving this movie positive reviews, I am guessing many of the positive reviews are from people who think they are reviewing another version of this film.  People should read the item description thoroughly before posting a review.  Check the film cast and release date to make sure you are commenting on the film you actually watched.

As a horse lover, who read Anna Sewells book, Black Beauty, probably 300 times, I absolutely loved it and thought of the good characters as friends.  The book is told mostly from the point of view of Black Beauty, something sorely missing from this lame film.  Almost every facet of Black Beautys life has been changed.  Why would film makers change nearly every event and character from a such a beloved story.  The book was beautiful and touching.  This movie is ridiculously silly and cartoonish.  Truly a travesty.
