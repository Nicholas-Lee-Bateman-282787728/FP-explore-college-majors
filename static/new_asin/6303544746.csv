698115,3,6303544746,"The show ""Mork & Mindy"" is a pretty good show. Pam Dawber, Robin Williams, and Elizabeth Kerr were great in it.
But the video quality [is quite poor]! It is recorded in SLP/EP mode. Now, this is okay for shows that are released in black and white, but not for shows in color. The image looks like it was recorded off TV, and the episodes were the standard cut versions that were shown on Nick at Nite from 1991-1995, and the now dead FOX Family Channel. They could've either:
A: Included more episodes for our money, or
B: Have Taped it in SP Mode if They Only Wanted Two Episodes On It
I think another company other then Paramount Video should release ""Mork & Mindy"" and it's sister series, ""Happy Days"" and ""Laverne & Shirley""",1008720000,12,728,4.4

698253,5,6303544746,"Mork & Mindy was my first introduction to the comic genius of Robin Williams.  There's something about that guy who truly make his character believable.  Garry Marshall picked the right guy for the gig.

Season 1 gives us the couple, Mork (Robin Williams), an alien from the planet Ork and the delicious looking Mindy (Pam Dawber), the carefree Coloradoan who happens to find Mork after the crash landing.  Once you've gotten used to the eccentricities of Mr. Williams, the show takes a mind of its own and he has you truly believing he's this idiot alien from Ork.

This season was truly the funniest, most spontaneous of the series, with Robin Williams at his laugh-out-loud finest.  Pam Dawber is the perfect ""straight man"" to Robin's zaniness, but you can tell that there are times when she can hardly keep from busting out laughing, which makes everything even funnier.

Watching these episodes is somewhat bittersweet, knowing that Robin is gone, but the true genius of his talent will forever live on.  Rest in peace, Robin, you will NEVER be forgotten.",1424649600,2,594,5.092783505154639

Because my real name is Mindi,I did spell it with a Y way back when,then rebelled for some weird reason n changed it, I would always be asked ""Where's Mork?"" Always made me giggle. Answer was-""Ork!"" I still have people ask me that,its a lil bittersweet now, I have to say ""Flying between heaven and Ork"".

698635,4,6303544746,"MORK & MINDY was a spinoff of HAPPY DAYS that ran on ABC from 1978-82 regarding an extraterrestrial named Mork(Robin Williams)from the planet Ork who comes to Earth in a small 1-man egg shaped space-ship and winds up with human friend and roommate Mindy McConnell(Pam Dawber)in Boulder, Colorado.

Future NEWHART co-star(Tom Poston) who plays Mindy's downstairs neighbor, Franklin Bickley along with the fact that this sitcom takes me back to memory lane to when I used to watch it as a kid every Thursday night on ABC until it was cancelled in the Summer of 1982, due to a sharp drop in ratings when Ronald Regan was the President and we had all those budget cuts going on from the recession we had from 1981-1982, but MORK & MINDY is in the works to come to Antenna TV eventually this year.",1421712000,2,792,4.617021276595745

When Robin Williams died I bought seasons 1 and 2 just to have so I could enjoy a sweeter gentler time in TV viewing. I'm 54 now and I still laugh myself silly with the episodes.

699014,5,6303544746,"So sorry to see Robin pass away, had to have a reminder of where he started out. I laughed so hard watching this I was rolling on the floor. Probably the best Mork and Mindy series to own, but some people have trouble keeping up with Williams since he is so fast and I'm sure half of what he says and does is impromptu. I had a great time and some fond memories come back with this. Yeah some of the stuff is corny and lame, but I forgot about characters like Exodoor and Bickley and a very early appearance by David Letterman that is hysterically funny. Also an early appearance by a very young and lovely Morgan Fairchild too. Some funny references to watergte, segregation, and incidents in Iran (""we can go to Iran and watch the governments change"" ""I'm knitting a new shawl for Iran"" etc.) If you have bipolar depression you can totally relate to the Mork character who can go from little kid to whacky to insane to melodramatic in under 30 seconds. Plus some interesting episodes where Mork talks about sadness, loneliness and the last episode is about the death of a caterpillar that I think we would all look at now in a special way, maybe this is how Robin would behave at his own ""funeral"" (which again is a blast). I don't remember the rest of the other seasons being as funny, and the episodes in this one get better as the season moves along. I love his impersonations of a charismatic minister, a police officer, a cowboy, and the way he fights without violence (we could all learn from that). Also don't miss Mork's Mixed Emotions which was rated by T.V. guide at one time as one of the top episodes to watch of a t.v. show (includes a brief nod to Steve Martin). One note about this particular disc is that there are no subtitles (perhaps no typist could keep up with Robin or understand half of what he says which is jibberish)but I wish I could understand what is being said at times because it's so fast.  A must have for fans of Robin Williams. Also includes a flashback to his ""Happy Days"" appearance with the Fonz. Gotta have it. Robin we miss you and look forward to seeing you again in paradise. Til then, laugh along with this. Robin, thanks for the memories.",1412899200,2,2184,4.405940594059406

699213,5,6303544746,"I really knew Robin Williams through his movies. I grew up watching Aladdin, Good Will Hunting, Jumanji, Hook, and Dead Poets society, and after hearing about his passing, I was heartbroken, thinking a huge part of my childhood was taken away from me. My family and I mourned watching his movies, and I went a little further when I researched Robin's life. Mork and Mindy was apparently what sky-rocketed Robin's Career, and my god, when they started showing reruns of Mork and Mindy on the television the weekend after his death, I was hooked right away. Robin truly was a genius with his improvisational skills, and really, it was much more entertaining than most of the crap they show on tv nowadays. Bought this DVD set right away, along with season 2 & 3. ( Shame how season 4 isn't available for purchase!) I'll keep these discs with me as long as I live, show them to my children in the future because this series is truly a gem. Rest in peace Robin Williams, you were sensational, and we'll keep you alive in our hearts!",1409356800,5,1028,4.562162162162162
699214,5,6303544746,"I had never seen this before and in the wake of Robin Williams' death I decided to give it a try. I really enjoyed it and I especially enjoyed Williams. Although everyone else does a decent job, the show is obviously his vehicle from start to finish. There are very few scenes where Williams is not on camera and rightfully so. One longtime star from sitcoms does show up on this show and that is Tom Poston who plays the downstairs neighbor. He was on both of the Newhart series.

Williams completely nails being an alien come to Earth. His character is very sweet and at times verges on the childlike. Unsurprisingly, he can rif at any moment on anything comedic and does so with different voices. This he did throughout his long career. Some of the things he does here would later appear in new skits on his stand up shows.

There is a surprise guest appearance by a young David Letterman in one episode, apparently trying his luck as an actor for sitcoms. It is a good thing he found Late Night hosting instead as his acting talents were meager.

Some aspect of the show demonstrate it is an older sitcom, made in 1978. Mindy and her family, for example, would seem trite by today's sitcom standards. But Williams more than makes up the difference. There is no question that he was a superstar in the making and that he would be the one person on the show enduring and going on to make feature films.

699977,5,6303544746,"I netflixed this last week and had to run out to buy it!  ""Mork and Mindy"" is a refreshing, innocent yet brilliant, sitcom from the late-70s.  The show revolves around an alien, Mork (from planet Ork), who is sent to Earth to study humanity.  He meets up with Minday, and hilarity ensues when Mork tries to understand the humans he's observing.

Mork, a naive innocent (or Autistic/Asperger's if he wasn't an alien), is played to outrageously perfect finesse by Robin Williams.  The one-liners, puns, double entendres, and dry wit sparkle in every episode.  And best of all, there isn't a real clunker amongst the lot of 25 episodes in this season.

I've never understood why this show had a laugh track; it's hardly needed.

I've also never understood why this show was hanging on the coattails of two 50s-throwback shows (Happy Days and Laverne & Shirley) as Mork & Mindy is set clearly in the long, long futuristic 1970s and in a state far, far away from Wisconsin!  There was no need to make this a 'spin-off', and the ratings quickly proved the show had a life of its own.

But I digress.  The DVD quality in this set is extremely good!  The audio is crisp and clear; and the film brilliantly restored; only the occasional film speck occurs - and the color is accurate and perfectly saturated.  It looks like it was made yesterday.  Pity it wasn't; this show is far better than most made at the time - so compared to today's offerings it surpasses by miles.  And having an average of 6 episodes per disc helps keep compression artifacting to a minimum.  I am VERY happy with the quality put into thee discs.

The series is clearly dated (45 RPM records, late-70s lingo, and all), yet there's an endearing, timelass magic to this show.

Of course, the ""fish out of water"" concept has always appealed to me...  so has sci-fi.  It's no wonder this show retains its jubilant cheekiness and ability to mix sci-fi with comedy that's sufficiently geeky yet accessible by all.

Highlighted episodes include:

""Mork in Love"":  In an attempt to learn about love, at the behesty of Mindy, Mork falls head over heels for Dolly... a mannequin.

""Mork's Seduction"":  A customer, Susan Taylor, recognizes Mindy.  And how Mork is hanging out with her.  Thinking Mork is her boyfriend, Susan is intent on taking him for herself; as revenge for Mindy stealing her boyfriend back in high school.

""Mork Goes Public"": Mork intends to turn himself into the authorities, so the reward money can go to help Mindy and her father's financial troubles.

""To Tell the Truth"":  Mork learns about lies and 'little white lies'.  (a brillaintly written episode)

""Mork the Gullible"":  Mork learns that not all people can be taken at face value.

""A Mommy for Morky"":  Mindy, reunited with an old love, is curious about raising childhood after talking with her friend who's about to deliver a baby.  Mork never had a mother.  But he has an Orkan Age Machine and is able to act like a baby...

""Mork's Greatest Hits"":  When a thug tries to hit on  an unwilling Mindy, Mork intercedes but doesn't truly know how to protect her.  She tries to teach him physical violence, but he prefers nonviolence.  Another terrific episode.

""Old Fears"":  An old friend of Cora's passes away and gets into depression.  Mork uses his aging machine to 'become' old and become a companion for Cora; with Mindy angry once she finds out what's going on.  (this is another sweet-hearted episode.)

""Mork's First Christmas"":  Mork invites the beautiful and egocentric, and selfish Susan Taylor over for Christmas...  much to Mindy's discontent.

""Mork and the Immigrant"":  Mork befriends a Russian immigrant and believes ""alien"" applies to him as it does the Russian...  things get worse when Mork is told all aliens need to be registered.

""Mork the Tolerant"":  Mork wishes to befriend a grumpy old neighbor (Mr. Bickley, played by Tom Poston)

""In Mork We Trust"":  Mr Bickley steals Mork's age machine...  hilarity ensues.  :)

""Mork Runs Down"":  Mork is looking for a job, but also has to celebrate his ""birthday"".  The trouble is, birthdays for Orkins can be fatal unless he recharges himself with his egg-like ""gleek"".  (the chickens worked overtime to help make this episode...)

""It's a Beautiful Mork"": Mork inadvertantly costs Mindy her job; and Mork decides to return to Ork.  Orson shows Mork what life would have been like if Mork had not entered her life.

Of course, season 2 starts with a bang as it features a 2-part opener that had me terrified as a kid (age 7 at the time (1979), please don't be too harsh...), what with Mork shrinking down to nothing and all...  and then there's that riotously funny Necroton 2-parter too (Racquel Welch, squeeeeeee!), first referenced in ""Mork's Greatest Hits""...  but that's for another day.

699978,4,6303544746,"At first glance, it is easy to see that ""Mork and Mindy"" is an older show. That said, it is still fun to watch even today.

Robin Williams, of course, is the clear star of the show: comic brilliance. He adds so much to the character - his voices, faces, physical humor - no one else could have played this part.

The character of Mork is brilliantly written - less as an alien and more as a very naive human. He's juxtaposed by a free-thinking, accepting college student, and her conservative, suspicious father. Their interactions actually say a lot about our society as Mork learns what it means to be an Earthling.

The packaging and digital remastering of the show it very sharp; I may not watch it every day, but I will cherish it as a part of my collection!",1138752000,6,763,4.397163120567376

I used to have a thing for Pam Dawber. Not only was she gorgeous but also all those boots she wore on the show with her skirts or pants. I liked the nice brown boots she wore with a long skirt getting out of her jeep in the opening credits of the show. And I liked one episode(Mork & the Immigrant) where she puts one of her beautiful burgundy boots on the table showing her sole. That fueled my sex fantasies for life.

One other reviewer complains that the jokes from Robin and Pam Dawber were ""pathetic"". Keep in mind, this was a Happy Days spinoff with a totally silly premise to begin with...and could have been a disaster with a lesser talent in the role. The results of casting Robin Williams as Mork were nothing less than magical. Just to keep up with Robin's manic performance takes repeated viewings to CATCH it all. ""Mork's Mixed Emotions"", ""Mork in Love"", and so many other episodes spotlight what Robin has come to be known for...taking something funny and putting it right over the top. Pam Dawber (and Paramount) knew they had a winner on their hands, and just let him roll when he got going. Silly? Definitely. Pathetic? Not in the least. Everyone in 1978 became fully aware of Robin Williams...you couldn't help but notice him. To his credit, on his first comedy album, he told an audience shouting ""Mork! Mork!"" that he wasn't doing that onstage because he was there to do something besdies the TV character he had become famous for. Not to take anything away from Mork, because he made the show his own and put his unique stamp on it. I'd like to know if anyone thinks someone else could have accomplished what Robin did on this series. It was a sweet, truly funny show and it brought to the limelight a brilliant, funny and remarkable comic genius who's never been less than incredible. I was right there every week to see what he'd do next. If that's pathetic, we need more of that kind of ""pathetic"".

700086,5,6303544746,"I first saw Mork and Mindy when I was about five and thought it was the funniest thing on earth. I would even sit on my head like Mork did and I had some of the Mork toys too.

So it's obvious I would grab this DVD box set as soon as it came out. And is Mork and Mindy as good today as it was back then? Of course! In fact it might be even better coz when you compare it to modern sitcoms M&M has more integrity as Robin Williams and Pam Dawber seem to be performing to a much rawer audience with more theatrical performances.

Robin Williams is just completely crazy as Mork (from Ork), an alien sent to Earth to investigate our strange customs and report back telepathically to Orson, his boss. Mindy is the girl he meets who gives him a home in her attic, much to the annoyance of her cynical dad. And, trust me, you can clearly see that Robin Williams often gives up the script to manically ad-lib his own madness while Pam Dawber runs after him, desperately trying to keep the show under control. It's so cool in certain moments when they're close together during a manic moment and she's looking into his eyes in amazement, petrified at what he's about to do next. He would also go crazy off-stage in an effort to distract Dawber when she had a scene on her own.

Supporting characters are also cool. Mr Bickley, Mindy's dad and grandma, Eugene and the outrageous Exidor all grab as much attention as they can whenever Williams isn't going mental. David Letterman, Dana Hill, Tammy Lauren, Morgan Fairchild, Penny Marshall and Geoffrey Lewis show up in cameos too. Plus Fonzie is the first episode (a flashback to Mork's first ever appearance in Happy Days).

There are NO FEATURES AT ALL on the DVDs. Which is annoying seeing as how this time I would have liked to have seen stuff. But I'm just glad to have it. Hey, Paramount, give us Season 2 NOW!!!

The show is presented in 1.33:1 full frame, as originally shot. And for a 27 year old show it looks great with very little in the way of print damage or grain. The sound is plain old mono but it's fine for what it is.

At the audition when Marshall asked Robin to sit down, he sat on his head. Marshall said he was the only real alien who applied.  Two appearances on Happy Days were so successful that Mork & Mindy became its own show.

A generous first season of 25 episodes.  Robin Williams in his first  TV series is a standout.  This first season is generally considered to be the best.

I don't think a show like this could survive today, with our sophisticated diet of special effects and reality show selfishness.

It was also cool to see someone besides myself wearing rainbow suspenders.

But while I love good comedy (love Saved by the Bell, Boy Meets World, Happy Days), I also love the idea of aliens visiting our world.  And while ""Mork and Mindy"" depicts that idea, I think it does so in a disrespectful way.

Why do aliens have to be wacky and funny?  Shouldn't any being that travels an interstellar distance in his spaceship (or whatever such a being calls it, perhaps a Qwerjubus) be remarkably smart?  Now, in the event we are visited one day, we're going to expect the aliens to be silly like Robin Williams.  And it's amazing how much that saddens me.

He had met the Fonz one day in Milwakee, and wanted to know how he was so cool.  Now he has a new friend, and roommate named Mindy.

Mindy had a dad who runs a record store with some old lady, possibly his mother.  I don't know.

As the weeks went by, he started to learn the customs of this world, which all seem mighty strange to him.  And he has to un-learn his personal customs like using his finger to drink water, and using his head (instead of his butt) to sit in a chair.

Somewhere on down the line, he met a strange man named Exodor.  A seemingly crazy fellow who intrigued Mork, especially when he would tell invisible people to move out of his way, so he could see and walk over to Mork.

This set is Mork's first year on our planet.  He has to make a report to the man in charge on his planet weekly, speaking of new customs he has learned.  A journal entry, if you will.

700183,5,6303544746,"In the late 1970's and early 1980's, this ""Happy Days"" spin off quickly took on a separate life of it's own---and made Robin Williams a household name.

After it went into syndication in various markets around the country, I vividly remember getting up at 12:30am in the summer time to catch graveyard airings of this show on a local independent station simply because I wanted to see it again.

Because I had also lived in Colorado and was obviously ""different"" from most of my peers, this show (whether it was formal creator intention or not) convincingly reassured me  I would find somebody who genuinely loved me for who I really was. Real friends look at the heart of the individual in question and do not care about the home planet (etc...) of the person.

Dispensing with the 1950's altogether, Mork and Mindy is set in (then) present-day Boulder Colorado, home to the ever-present conglomeration of hippies/free spirits and college students. The first episode is especially important because of the environmental context in which Mork and Mindy first meet each other.

University of Colorado Journalism student Mindy McConnell (Pam Dawber) is on a date with a `good' guy when he suddenly attacks her. Initially traumatized by the event, she receives a second shock after realizing that her mystery savior is not a Catholic priest----but an eccentric who placed a business suit on backwards. Mindy is understandably scared until she realizes that he is really a non-violent alien from outer space who is only trying to learn about Earth.

Hillarity ensues as Mork moves in with Mindy (capitalizing on the baby boom generation's unprecedented cohabitation) and he attempts to blend in. For all of Boulder's eccentricities, Mork still appears 'different' from most people. The living arrangement initially bothers her conservative musician father Fred (Conrad Janis) but he grudgingly learns to accept Mork as part of the family.

Another great character is Mindy's grandmother Flora (Elizabeth Kerr) who also works in the family music shop in downtown Boulder's Pearl Street pedestrian mall.  She is responsible for ensuring the otherwise staid music shop stocks enough rock and roll to bring in the local college age community---and thus keep the family music store afloat. Although she does not figure out his real idenity, she respects Mork for his generalized difference.

Williams may have subsequently moved on to more famous roles and the wardrobe (with the exception of Dawber's clothes) appears somewhat dated, but this show is a mandatory DVD library acquisition for baby boomers and gen-xers alike. Plus, unlike the previous series releases (however cherished in their own time) this is a full series instead of a trickling of select episodes preselected by a third party.
