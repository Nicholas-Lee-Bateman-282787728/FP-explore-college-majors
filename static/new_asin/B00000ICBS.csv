8178723,5,B00000ICBS,"This is a very funny movie, not a martial arts movie in the traditional sense, but very comical, and a nice family movie, a type of movie similar to three ninja's. The plot revolves around
two young boys - one is on vacation from Shaolin and the other is a little street hustler. They meet up at some point with Yuen
Biao and have to fight the bad guys.",973728000,,353,4.130434782608695
