8442590,5,B004V2FUQW,"""Do Raaste"" portrays the aspirations & disappointments of a middle class family. The head of the Gupta family, Balraj Sahni manages with great difficulty to educate Prem Chopra, his younger brother abroad for which he had to mortgage his ancestral home. Prem Chopra returns and marries Bindu a rich girl. Tensions arise due to Bindu's behaviour and Prem & wife shift to a new home. Prem, who has got a very good job refuses to share Balraj's burden. The tired old Balraj, who has lost his job, is not able to repay back the loan and is kicked out of his home along with his family. This devastates Balraj. In the end Prem realizes that he has stopped loving his family due to Bindu's machinations and reconciles with Balraj.
The film revolves around Balraj -his hopes, responsibilities, aspirations & misfortunes. The romance of Rajesh Khanna & Mumtaz is incidental to the script but provides lilting songs. The brilliant script & Raj Khosla's superb direction holds the viewer's interest.",1305763200,,989,4.892857142857143
