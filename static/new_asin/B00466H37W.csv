This one was exceptionally good!",1334102400,,113,4.181818181818182
4264605,3,B00466H37W,"(Huge fan and glad I bought it - the 3 stars is only about the product, not the show.)

The big complaint in the Season 9 reviews was poor packaging/the lack of an episode list, which had me nearly downgrading it to 3 stars. OK, we all make mistakes, but there's no excuse for making the same mistake twice, so this time I have given only 3 stars. Surely Universal's well-paid marketing and sales people ought to check out the feedback on sites like this?

What adds insult to injury is that there is a paper insert with Season 10 - perfect for an episode list with summaries, which is what I thought it was at first - but it turns out just to be an ad for something or other.",1333152000,11,676,4.152671755725191
4264606,5,B00466H37W,"I enjoyed each and every episode of this season.  I missed Benjamin Bratt and thought he should have had a better send off in the 9th season.  I loved the always direct and fearless Angie Harmon - it seems they toned down her character's behavior in this season.  it did take a little getting used to in the 9th season but soon became a part of who her character was.  Jack seemed to take more control in this season.  As always my all-time favorite, Lenny Briscoe, is there to find any means necessary in nabbing the bad guys.  Great scripts and talented actors kept this show alive, no matter how many people came and went. It would be nice to see more shows like this one instead of being overloaded with ridiculous and useless reality shows hitting the airwaves.",1332979200,19,766,4.474820143884892
4264607,5,B00466H37W,"This is another season of interesting crimes and intriguing court cases.  They always do a good job of offering a variety of suspects, then honing in on the real culprit.

4264608,3,B00466H37W,"Season 10 contains many engrossing and very well-written episodes, but the packaging is a rip-off. It would have cost them next to nothing to include a list of episodes, but there is none. The episodes themselves rate five stars -- but the lousy packaging only one -- making an average of three stars.",1331856000,10,301,4.69811320754717
4264609,4,B00466H37W,"As I stated in my review of Season 9 of Law and Order, the producer should have included an episode list as was the case for the DVDs with the first 8 seasons. They have repeated their omission with Season 10. I can obtain the list on line as I did with Season 9, but the producer should have had respect for the customer and just gone the ""extra mile"" and added one.  Having said all that I do hope they release the rest of the Law and Order the greatest TV series ever on a year by year basis with or without and episode list as I will not buy the whole set since I own the first half + Season 14 already.",1330732800,6,607,3.8951612903225805
4264610,2,B00466H37W,"Let me make it clear, straight up, that this is a review of the product, not of the show.  As a huge Law & Order fan, I can say that the quality of these episodes is top-notch.

The product that NBC Universal/Universal Studios has put out though is another story.

I'm willing to ignore the lack of an episode list because I can just as easily get that online. Missing that doesn't really detract from the quality.

What I CANNOT and WILL NOT ignore is the absence of the crossover Law & Order SVU episode ""Entitled - Part 1."" The L&O Part 2 episode is present, but nowhere to be found is the important Part 1, DESPITE THE BACK COVER SAYING IT IS FEATURED!

When Season 9 came out, it took me a while to figure out where they had hidden the ""Homicide"" crossover episode. It was there, just very awkwardly placed. So before writing this review, I searched each of the five discs of Season 10 meticulously to see if I was missing something. I wasn't. It's nowhere to be found.

So why isn't it there? Copyright issues aren't a problem considering that it's the same production company. Season 1 of SVU is available on DVD, so DVD rights and issues shouldn't exist.  I'm not as much of a fan of SVU, at least not enough to buy a season set just to get the one episode.

Am I sorry I bought the set? No. At Amazon's $24.99 price, it's still a steal for the quality of the episodes. But as far as I'm concerned, NBC Universal/Universal Studios owes me a disc with that SVU Episode on it.",1330646400,44,1482,4.28673835125448
4264611,5,B00466H37W,"I just had to comment on the fact that theprevious review stated the 'finally the 10th Season is here'. If all of the true ""L&O"" fans would just buy the Complete Series (see my review on that product's page), there'd be no more waiting. I owned the Seasons that were already out (1-8 & 14) when, on November 6th, The Complete Series came out for a steal @ $450.00! To have all 457 Episodes at my viewing disposal was too much to pass up on such an inexpensive price tag! To all ""L&O' fans...JUST BUY THE COMPLETE SERIES!!!",1329523200,,522,4.336734693877551

4264650,5,B00466H37W,"I enjoyed nearly all of the seasons of Law & Order, although Angie Harmon was one of my favorite actresses on the series. Also, the character of Lennie Briscoe was always interesting, as were most of the other characters. Although I preferred Michael Moriarty to Sam Watterson, the latter was competent in his role. It was nice when a conservative view was aired which was part of the appeal of the show, as the characters discussed different sides of the issues presented in the show. Angie Harmon took that view during the Tenth season, besides being one of the most beautiful woman on the series. I follow her now on Rizzoli & Isles. When she left they placed the conservative view with Fred Dalton Thompson, but it was nice to see a woman espouse the conservative view.",1428883200,,773,4.649635036496351

4264670,2,B00466H37W,"I am a true fan of this series and feel that it is the best of the Law and Order franchise.  A number of reviews reflect the lack of an episode list.  I will not cover this.  What makes me completely unhappy with not only this season but also the season nine DVDs is the fact that the disc menu is completely useless.  For example, when you complete an episode, the disc returns to the menu where the next episode on the list is highlighted.  You press PLAY or OK on your remote and the disc plays the episode that you previously watched.  You waste a lot of time scrolling up and down the menu to actually get the disc to play the episode that you wish to watch.  Another flaw is that if you choose the option to watch the entire disc which with other series, the episodes play in order without returning to the disc menu.  Not so with seasons nine and ten.  When an episode finishes the old familiar disc menu returns.  Not only this, but the same issue that I mentioned above occurs.  NBC-Universal, or whomever manufactures these discs, needs to correct these flaws as it is annoying to continually have to scroll a number of times to actually watch the episode that you wish to watch.  A poor DVD for a great series!",1401753600,,1221,4.307017543859649

4264730,5,B00466H37W,"Meet Detective Ed Green portrayed by Jesse L. Martin. A single overzealous cop who has a record for excessive force and a gambling addiction, Green will sometimes push the envelope a little further. A contrast from the devout Catholic family man that was Detective Curtis. The tenth year is full of memorable episodes. From cops dropping off a rich boy in Harlem to the prosecution of a Chilean politician for the murder of an American in Chile. One of the most memorable episodes is Gunshow, the season opener about the spree shooting of college students, most of whom were women. The topic of this episode is an ever so important discussion taking place throughout our country. Despite where you stand on gun control, when McCoy dumps that tray full of bullets on the table you feel for the family members of the victims that were killed. There is also a crossover with the spinoff, Law & Order: Special Victims Unit called ""Entitled Pt 2."" Part 1 is not included in this DVD set, unlike the Homicide crossovers. Instead you will have to purchase either a digital copy of the SVU episode or just buy season 1 of SVU on dvd(but that is another review). Also, Detectives Olivia Benson played by Mariska Hargitay and Eliot Stabler played by Chris Meloni guest star in the episode ""Fools For Love."" Season 10 also marks the last season in which Steven Hill portrays District Attorney Adam Schiff. At the time he was the longest running character and the last to leave from the first seasons. The tenth year shows that after a decade of being on air, Law & Order was still going strong. The revolving door for the shows cast continues to bring in new characters and pay farewell to old ones. Look at New York City in 1990 and look at it in the year 2000. A lot has changed since then including the evolving criminal mind continues and so the laws must change too.

I deduct one star (again) due to the cheap packaging and lack of extras. Dick Wolf and Universal obviously were looking ahead to the big box set they finally released a few months back, and obviously were not about to waste time giving extras to those of us who had already collected several years of the show individually.

You want more money and give me less product.  And then it seems that the distributors don't know how to count either.  I've got season 14--than ten plus 3--where's 13?

People let's cut the silliness --if they can't give you a synopsis, much less a season categorically and better packaging we aren't purchasing!!

After watching the many years the show originally aired, and the many, many years/episodes on the re-runs, now I can continue to enjoy my favorite characters, especially Jack McCoy, on a regular and ""at-will"" basis. For good drama, I strongly recommend this entire series to anyone.",1350691200,,435,4.7105263157894735

I had seen all of these when they were on and it was very nostalgic to watch them again. With all the bad tv shows that are on now, going back to these shows is worth it.",1348272000,,343,4.044117647058823

Several other episodes had almost incomprehensible or utterly unconvincing plots.  Slim pickings for L&O fans, but (just about) better than nothing.

The physical product was fine, the acting & direction were OK, the plots were not.",1346198400,4,408,5.044776119402985

4264788,4,B00466H37W,"Like others here, I am a long time L&O fan. I also happen to be a real Abbie Carmichael fan. Unwilling to spring for the entire box set of all seasons, especially with the comments about the aspect ratio on some of the discs [though the price itself is fair for what is provided], I have been buying season by season. I started with Season 9 [Abbie's line ""let's hang 'em all"") perhaps my all-time favorite, and like others here, although concerned when at first it was difficult to find the Homicide crossover, it was there. Could this boxed and packaged better? Absolutely. Going to the wiki to get show titles, credits, and air dates is a modest PITA, but it's not that big a deal. The real labor is still ripping and tagging on to my media server. But like others, I was incredibly disappointed by the absence of Entitled Part 1 from this disc set. So, I dutifully downloaded it from iTunes to complete what I think ought to be this disc's full set.
