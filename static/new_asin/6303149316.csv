573235,3,6303149316,"I saw this movie in 1994 at the theater, and I went into it hoping for as good a movie as the original.  Of course, with sequels that is largely the ""Stuff of legend"", and this movie proved to be no exception.  It was still an enjoyable film, however.  Most of the great cast from the original returned for this installment, with the major exception being Wesley Snipes as ""Willie Mays Hayes.""  He was replaced by Omar Epps, who did what turned out to be a decent job with the role.  At the time, I wished they would have written it so that Hayes had gotten traded instead of hiring another actor to play him, since I thought Snipes was the ultimate for the part.  However, Epps later won me over for his outstanding performance in ""Higher Learning"", so he is OK in my book.  As far as the DVD for this movie is concerned, it has the all-important ""Widescreen"" feature, which for us purists is the only real way to watch a movie.  The trailer for this film as well as some bonus trailers are included, but that's about it for extras.  The sound quality of this DVD is great and the price is affordable.  Although not as good as the original film, this one is worth picking up.  One last thing about this is that, despite the lack of extras, at least Warner Bros. did their part and released Major League 2 and 3 on DVD.  I have to agree with the above reviewer in wondering why Paramount has not gotten their act together and released the original ""Major League"" on a DVD of their own?  A step in the right direction for them was getting ""The Bad News Bears"" out recently.  Until then, I was starting to think they had something against baseball movies.  I guess all we can do is keep hoping and dreaming that it will show up one of these days.  Let's all hope that the delay is attributed to them taking the time to do it right and include a commentary track with the director or better yet, the hilarious Bob Uecker.  Until that day arrives, the DVD of ""Major League II"" would be a worthwhile purchase.",1020124800,11,2004,4.315508021390374
573236,3,6303149316,"The first Major League movie was a good one but this is better. The Cuban Crusher Pedro Cerano, Rick ""The Wild Thing"" Vaughn, Willie Mayes Hayes, and newcomer Rude Baker are one fire. Rick comes to this season as a ... pretty boy pitcher who cares too much about injuring his arm that he can't even throw 90. Cerano comes back as a spiritual Budha and is so stupid now that he hits a bird with a baseball and runs in the outfield to save it's life while he gets tagged out... Willie comes back without the speed but has a lot more power and as a movie star with a leg injury. New-comer Rude Baker can't throw to the pitcher even though he's a catcher. See if they'll come back. Also a funny Japenese outfielder is added on who has spritual fights with Cerano.",1018137600,3,759,4.241379310344827
573237,5,6303149316,"Of all the baseball movies at our house, I like ""the new ballpark movie"" the most.  My favorite characters are Baker and Tannaka, but I also like to swing the bat like Parkman and pitch like Wild Thing.  The best thing about the movie is that it is full of on-field action and there are very few ""talking parts"".  We currently own the DVD version, but Mommy and Daddy want the VHS version so I can watch it in my playroom.",1013385600,2,422,4.185185185185185
573238,4,6303149316,"I swear, the Major League Trilogy is the greatest trilogy that's ever graced the movies. And this 2nd one is my 2nd favorite of the 3, with the original being the best. Let's get to the categories:

If you saw the first M.L. this one is pretty identical. Indians fans think they're gonna have a great season because the all-star team is returning, plus they signed a new ball player, Jack Parkman, who's suppose to be a franchise player. Roger Dorn has retired, and became club owner. So everything is looking good right? No, because the pitcher, Rick Vaughn(Charlie Sheen) went from bad boy to clean cut, and has lost all his pitching power, and all the other players have their own sets of problems too. We see 2 other new players, catcher Rube Baker, and fielder, Tanaka, both are hilarious. This movie was great, and has some of the best baseball action I've ever seen.

You got widescreen version here, and it really looks great on the DVD player, and the transfer rates look pretty smooth. Plus the layout of the DVD menus are some of the best I've ever seen! The usual, great, Dolby Digital experience is here, so feel free to hook up your speakers and get a great sound fest.

Well, this movie was made in 1994, and if re-released DVD's from earlier than '98 don't say ""Special/Collector's Edition""  than don't expect much for extras. All you get here is your basic subtitles, and a theatrical trailer as well. Then you got this ""starting lineup"" feature which might look like a cast & crew filmographies off most DVD's but it's just photos of the 9 major actors of the movies on baseball cards instead. Oh, plus there's 2 other trailers for other movies in here too. But nothing special.",978134400,7,1696,4.587458745874588

573547,1,6303149316,"Major League 2 is an unoriginal, unpleasant and unsteady sequel to the more successful Major League. This film is not so much a sequel, as a remake, with a few tweaks. It copies the original to a degree that spoils a lot of the humor, but the few tweaks make the film too crowded, and spoil the rhythm. The arrhythmic nature of the story makes it unpleasant. For example, there is an obnoxious fan, who sometimes is funny, but the films choppy pace ends up making him more annoying than funny. So, this film has little of the charm of the original, although it did manage to keep much of the originals lewd, rude and profane quality.",1447977600,,633,4.418803418803419

Oh, the same actors return and their characters have the same names, but they're almost completely different than they were in the first film. Charlie Sheen's Rick ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn has gone from bad boy pitcher to a clean-cut bore who starts naming his pitches. Dennis Haysbert's Pedro Cerrano, formerly a no-nonsense power hitter whose religion was voodoo, is now a pacifist and a Buddhist. Even Corbin Bernsen's Roger Dorn is more of a weenie than usual. The only three actors whose characters seemed to have managed to stay like their former selves are Tom Berenger's Jake Taylor, James Gammon's Lou Brown and Bob Uecker's Harry Doyle. The film is almost completely devoid of laughs although the story line is somewhat coherent.

It is set the next season of play  of the victorious Indians win the ""big"" game. The heroes of the previous season have grown into flawed players. this film shows what happens to young men who suddenly have big ideas and big paychecks. There are several new players added to the team each of which brings new angles and stories. It is enjoyable and entertaining. It probably helps if the viewer is a baseball fan.
the second film on this disc is ""Major League:Back to the Minors"" I found it strained and disappointing. I very much like Scott Bakula who was the star of this movie and that kept me interested. The story was about a seriously limited minor league baseball team who gets Bakula (a rundown Minor League player who is traded to the Buzz)as a first time manager. Several of the players are from the first two movies in this series. Pedro Ceriano (Dennis Haysbert) repeats as the Cuban refugee who worships Buddah and threatens to set fire to the locker room is delightful.  the manager is played by a movie old timer  who leads with tongue in cheek. there were a number of other sports odd balls including Bob Uecker as the team broadcaster, Corbin Bernsen as the temporary Owner and perfectly cast Ted McGinley as the vain and hot tempered Manager of the senior team's manager. This film is funnier than Number 2 in the series.

574444,5,6303149316,"The boys from Cleveland are back to prove that last year's team was no fluke in this great sequel film.  After winning their divison, the Indians were defeated by the Chicago White Sox in the ALCS.  After losing, team owner Rachel Phelps (Margaret Whitton) sold the team to former third baseman Roger Dorn (Corbin Bernsen).  Roger then brought in high-priced free agent catcher Jack Parkman (David Keith) to bolster the Indians line up.  However, incumbent catcher Jake Taylor (Tom Berenger) is still on the team, along with another catching prospect, Rube Baker (Eric Brushotter).  Pedro Cerrano (Dennis Haysbert), Willie Mays Hayes (Omar Epps), and Rick ""Wild Thing"" Vaughn (Charlie Sheen) also return from last year's team, along with manager Lou Brown (James Gammon).

Hayes starred in his own action movie in the off-season, and also tried turning into a power hitter, much to the chagrin of manager Brown.  Cerrano discovered Buddhism, and now treats everybody as a friend, even the opposing players during a game.  Jake's knees finally got the best of him, but Lou asks him to stay on as a coach.  Roger soon finds out that he's in way over his head.  He overpaid Rachel for the team, and now he has only enough money left for two months of operations.  His first move is to trade Parkman to the hated White Sox for outfielder Isuro Tanaka (Takashi Ishibashi).  Tanaka immediately challenges Cerrano, saying he has ""no marbles"".  Roger's second move is to re-sell the team back to Rachel, much to the horror of everyone else! Rick Vaughn has shed his ""Wild Thing"" image.  He and his agent/girlfriend Rebecca Flannery (Alison Doody) have concentrated on getting commercial advertisements and endorsement opportunities.  Meanwhile, Rick has lost a lot of the zip off of his once-blazing fastball, and he's now getting hit hard by opposing teams.

Their season starts out rather slowly, just like the previous year, and to make matters worse, Lou Brown suffers a heart attack and is forced to step down as manager.  Jake is given the job as manager in Lou's absence, and it falls on his shoulders to mold the team back into winners.  Will Jake be able to get the team back on track.  Will Rick, Willie, and Pedro re-discover their lost talents?

Many times, sequels fail to live up to the success of the original film, but that is not the case with this excellent movie.  Major League 2 is every bit as good as the original.  Having everyone except Wesley Snipes back from the first movie helped to make this movie so much fun to watch, and Omar Epps does a fantastic job taking over for Snipes as Willie Mays Hayes.  Newcomers David Keith (Parkman), Takashi Ishibashi (Tanaka), and Eric Brushotter (Baker) add new flavor with their new characters, and Bob Uecker returns as the zany Indians announcer Harry Doyle.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Baseball fans will surely enjoy watching the Indians in their chase to win the World Series.",1137196800,24,2958,4.8562874251497

574521,3,6303149316,"I was a big fan of Major League, but was somewhat disappointed in Major League II, even though I think it's worth having, and it is an enjoyable movie to watch.

In the first Major League, we got a first class baseball story of unlikely heroes, which held up well even though I thought the personal lives of some of the players was stressed a little too much. In Major League II, which is still entertaining, I think the chemistry suffered because of this and other continuity issues. For instance, Wesley Snipes, the base stealing pheenom, was replaced by another actor, yet we are supposed to believe he's the same person. Doesn't quite work. Our memories aren't THAT short. Also, the love interest focus switched from Tom Berenger to Charlie Sheen, which is ok, but we are supposed to know all about (and root for) a former girlfriend we have never seen before, whose existence wasn't even hinted at in the first film. And finally, the chemistry suffered a little more because the feud between the owner and the players was reintroduced in an unlikely way (why would she buy the team back if she wanted to get out of Cleveland so bad in the first film?). This antagonism which worked so well in the first film falls flat in the second (also it is introduced late, almost as an afterthought). Still the second film was enjoyable and as part of the series is a must-have.

But if you're considering this don't neglect Major League 3, Back to the Minors, which presents many new characters (while retaining several of the old favorites especially Cerrano) and all is well done with spontaneity and good chemistry. The action, photography, writing, gags, and music all work well together and for me it's now hard to pick a favorite between I and III.
