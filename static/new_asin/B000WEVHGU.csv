8223084,4,B000WEVHGU,Willie Neal Johnson was the ultimate entertainer. He loved the Lord and did not care who knew it. I really enjoyed this live performance and watching Johnson and the Keynotes control the crowd through showmanship and plain old praising the Lord. If you enjoy traditional gospel music with a lot of flare you will enjoy this dvd.,1362700800,4,328,4.771929824561403
