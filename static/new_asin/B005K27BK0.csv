8476430,5,B005K27BK0,"Superlative writing and an outstanding cast mark Shortcut to Happiness as one of the best and most entertaining films I've seen in quite some time. The story of The Devil and Daniel Webster is a familiar one, but the execution of this version is dynamic on every level. What writer does not suffer the angst of witnessing the most incompetent achieve outrageous success, while his own cherished manuscripts might lie gathering dust on a shelf?

What if Hell's most attractive demon offered you that success, but it turned out to be vacuous and meaningless as society honored you for any piece of dreck that you churned out? Could it be any worse than witnessing the success of other incompetents as genuine talents around you fail?

There's a lot to examine here, and I found myself thinking about Shortcut to Happiness for days after watching it! Excellent film! (Pray for a Region 1 version or find it on cable.)",1393459200,3,914,4.7784810126582276
