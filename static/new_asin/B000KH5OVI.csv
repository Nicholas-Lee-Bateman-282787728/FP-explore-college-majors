8156840,3,B000KH5OVI,"If you are thinking about buying this DVD, I'd expect you're a fan of stop-action animation or specifically Ray Harryhausen's work.
So I won't attempt to review the DVD for those unfamiliar with Harryhausen.

This DVD has the following titles:
  The Story of King Midas
  The Story of ""Rapunzel""
  The Figurehead
  The Story of ""Little Red Riding Hood""
  The Story of ""Hansel and Gretel""
  Mother Goose: Nursery Rhyme Review (Little Miss Muffet, Old Mother Hubbard, Queen of Hearts, Humpty Dumpty)

(Note that ""The Figurehead"", a Halas & Batchelor stop-motion cartoon of a poem by Crosbie Garstin, is entertaining, but I have so far seen no evidence that Ray Harryhausen was involved in its creation)

What should you know about this particular DVD?
Except for ""The Figurehead"", all these features are on ""Ray Harryhausen: The Early Years"", perhaps with some restoration
  (At least some of those ""color-restored"" RHTEY versions now seem a bit over-saturated)
The resolution is not super, that's probably mostly the source material.
There is no menu; the features in the collection just play one after another.
The case is thin; about 3-4 x a DVD's thickness,
There isn't much information about the contents provided with the DVD.

I believe I picked this up in a discount bin for about $3 some years ago.
I'd recommend ""The Early Years"" in preference to this, but that seems to have gone out of print.",1398816000,,1402,4.944206008583691
