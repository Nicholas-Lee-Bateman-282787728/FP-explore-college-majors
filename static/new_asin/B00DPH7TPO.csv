5841352,4,B00DPH7TPO,"(copy/pasted from my reviews on the other releases, with an updated episode list)

For those few of us in the US who already know about this adorable little Canadian cartoon, seeing this and the other five DVDs that were just released this week is great news! This marks the first time Ruby Gloom has ever been available in the US, and collectively, these six releases give us more than double the number of total episodes released on the two existing Canadian sets.

For those of you out there who haven't yet met Ruby Gloom, the product description describes her and her cartoon
pretty much perfectly: ""In a Victorian mansion on the outskirts of Gloomsville lives Ruby Gloom. Ruby's perfect day is a gloomy one, full of creativity and adventure with her offbeat circle of friends."" Ruby is the quintessential ""Perky Goth"" girl; that is, her skin is ghastly white and she wears a black dress with yellow-and-red striped stockings and all of her friends are cyclopses and skeletons and banshees and two-headed frankenstein rock stars, yet instead of being outright creepy, she's the self-proclaimed Happiest Girl In The World. Ruby is boundlessly lovable and wants to do nothing but share that happiness with everyone she meets.

The characters and setting and overall tone of the show are very reminiscent of Tim Burton's family films, Beetlejuice The Animated Series, and classic 60s Addams Family. The show remains at all times perfect for viewers of any age - there may be a few spooks here and there, but they're the fun sort of spooks, the ones that insist that monsters are not so much vicious as mischievous.

The only things preventing me from giving these releases five stars are the following: six DVD sets consisting of four episodes apiece at $9 a pop is a tad more than I'd prefer to spend (hardly more than you'd pay for any other standard retail DVD though), and oddly enough, the short bumper segments that bookended each episode when they aired on TV have been disconnected from their respective episodes and stuffed into a subcategory on each DVD called ""mini-episodes"", though they were included in their original spots on the Canadian releases. From what I can see, this is true on all of the American DVDs.

Episodes included on this particular DVD:

+ Gloomer Rumor
+ Doom With A View
+ Missing Buns
+ Iris Springs Eternal

An imperfect release, but a long-awaited US release nonetheless, a healthy does of sales might convince Phase 4 Films to license and produce DVDs for the remainder of the episodes, so I do recommend that fans pick these up! It's great not having to scrounge around YouTube to find sloppy, low-res copies of episodes split into three chunks just to get your Ruby fix. :)",1379030400,4,2716,4.802997858672377

5841371,5,B00DPH7TPO,"We came to the wonder of Ruby Gloom late, but ever since watching the first DVD from renting it from the library, we were hooked.  The characters are easily lovable, the episodes are delightful for all ages, and the signature opening song is addictive.

As odd as this sounds, whenever we are having a ""less than perfect day"", we watch a little Ruby Gloom and all of a sudden, we are indeed ""looking on the bright side"" of life.

We love it.",1390176000,,441,4.353658536585366

The episodes are mostly light and silly (with a positive message), and the show is primarily aimed at a very young audience. But I get a kick out of the ""horror-cliches-as-normal"" premise. (Besides, where else can you encounter characters with names like ""Malady"" and ""Malaise""?) If you like offbeat cartoons, ""Ruby Gloom"" is worth a watch.",1429833600,,451,4.794871794871795
