8459824,5,B0056P5R34,"Impromptu is one of my very favorite movies, and it came packaged with two other enjoyable films. Impromptu tells the true story of the famous love affair between Chopin and George Sand, his brilliant lover who dressed and thought of herself as a man. She put on a dress to appeal to Chopin, but her advances never worked--until she convinced him of her sincere love and admiration. A wonderful comedy with ingratiating supporting players such as Bernadette Peters, Julian Sands, and Mandy Patinkin.  The incomparable Judy Davis and Hugh Grant play George Sand and Chopin.",1432944000,,572,5.021052631578947

8459827,4,B0056P5R34,"This is one of those multiple movies in one case bargains where if you want one movie, you got to buy others. I wanted ""Impromptu"", a story of Polish composer Fredrick Chopin, played by Hugh Grant (I liked this one), and got ""Four Weddings and A Funeral"", also staring Hugh Grant, which I found to be funny. I watched the first 15 minutes of ""Something Short of Paradise"", then turned it off. Nuff said.",1401667200,,403,4.45945945945946
8459828,4,B0056P5R34,"4 Weddings... is a classic/classy English romantic comedy with great writing and acting across the board. Hugh Grant and Andie McDowell are just bubbling with chemistry and the rest of the cast is wonderful. It is a sweet, funny and intelligent film, with over the top directing and writing. Impromptu is a partly fictionalized version of the romance between the Polish Composer Fredrich Chopin and the woman writer George Sand. Judy Davis is amazing as Sand and Hugh Grant is perfect as the sickly Chopin. Emma Thompson is hilarious as the art starved Duchess. Again the exquisite writing and directing by James Lapine makes this a must see, and is much less fictionalized than  Amadeus, where 90% of the story is made up for commercial reasons, like so many movies on famous people, like John Nash in A Beautiful Mind, where all the spy stuff is made up to sell tickets. The Paradise film is a flop as there is no chemistry between male and female lead. And the writing is clunky. But the DVD is worth it by far for the first two films above, Recommended EAN",1378166400,4,1060,4.638297872340425
