8755973,5,B01DJ63EO0,"I really enjoyed this series. Gosick is a Japanese rendering of the word ""Gothic"", and the anime series programmatically falls into two halves. The first part is somewhat episodic, with Victorique solving crimes which the police (and her detective brother) have not been able to solve in years past. She uses her somewhat mystic intuition to provide insight into the nature of the crimes and the perpetrators. The second part of the series is a bit darker and goes into her youth and background and her relationship with her somewhat nefarious father who's pulling strings in national politics in their (fictional) European nation and its potential to affect her future.

Overall, I found this a very very enjoyable series. This particular set is from an Australian publisher, Madman, who is one of the major anime publishers in that country, and is a Region 4 disk, not playable on a US DVD (Region 1) or BluRay (Region 1/Region A) player, and in the European PAL broadcast format, which is not compatible with US NTSC televisions.

But region-free / PAL compatible DVD and Blu-Ray players are available from several online retailers in the US, such as bombayelectronics and 220-electronics, as well as some models here on Amazon; prices are reasonable and getting more so all the time. If you have any interest in video titles from the UK (and some anime series are less expensive on UK disks than on US disks, check Amazon's UK website), a region-free / PAL compatible player may be a worthwhile investment for you.

Gosick is not available in a standard US release at this time. Bandai had licensed this title, but left the US market before releasing it; no one else seems to have picked up the license in the US yet. The title is also available in disks from Malaysia. I haven't seen those disks so don't know the subtitle quality, but subtitles from Malaysia are sometimes ""iffy"". Subs on those disks may be just fine, but I don't know.

You may not want to invest in a new DVD or Bluray player just for this title, but if you have one, I highly recommend this series.",1470873600,2,2074,4.720994475138122
