8721181,4,B0100993M6,"This is a made for television Czech production that is actually in English - with a smattering if German. It is based on the writings of Arnost Lustig and this is based on his own experiences as a prisoner in that terrible concentration camp. The tale here is of Vili (Jir Mdl) and Colette (Clmence Thioly) who meet in the camp and actually fall in love.

It is a story essentially told in flashback but the real meat of the plot is in the camps. We have all the ingredients here and those with good knowledge of the horrors will still find this tough going as some of the tortures and brutality of the Germans is hard to watch. The CGI and recreation of the camp seems excellent, with the falling ash a constant as it falls like a malevolent rain on prisoners and Nazis alike.

The music is really good too and creates the right amount of atmosphere for the horrors and the fleeting joys that are as hard to come by as food in. The Kommandant is played as a perfectly evil soulless being who holds sway over his dominion of shame with ruthless efficiency. This was made in 2013 and its original title is just `Colette' - here we see it renamed but it is still a production that falls at the top end of the spectrum and it is a film I find easy to recommend .",1442620800,3,1259,4.219917012448133
