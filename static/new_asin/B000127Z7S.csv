8005394,2,B000127Z7S,"I adore Brum, however, this is NOT the exact show we watch in the UK. It has been cut, and the film sped up to an OBNOXIOUS and nauseating pace for DVD viewing stateside. I am actually offended that the programme is so altered, Americans would enjoy it in its perfect condition, children in the US will enjoy Brum without the dizzying speed at which the film careens out of control for US consumption. As Brum did not really take off here, I may have a point. Check out the original format on youTube, determine for yourself what I am on about. We will buy Brum from UK sellers from now on as we have a multisystem player.  I strongly recommend Brum in its original format, not the US version.",1429142400,,693,4.3307692307692305

My 'almost two year old' who's vocabulary is quite limited as you can imagine, can say these words. He just LOVES this show and now he loves the video. There are only a couple of videos he asks to watch and this is one of them. BRUM, of course, I imagine, is the revving of the car's motor, and little boys do love cars.
About an antique car that lives in a garage, Brum basically saves the day in Big Town in each episode, which is live action, filled with music and mime, and SO creatively assembled. The show has a British style to it, coming from the creators of Tele-tubbies, but it's totally a different concept with real people.
Is it silly? Yes. But it's uplifting and filled with little values that are taught in subtle fashion. He dances and sings (in his own language) throughout, and his attention is captured entirely.
As an aside, I was in a mall last weekend and saw the radio-contolled Brum car on sale at a Radio Shack. Needless to say...$25 later, we have the car, too.
This is a winner.",1080259200,11,1022,4.356020942408377
