5165142,5,B008HUSFIE,"Yep. Beetleborgs is finally to DVD. I hope this volume will have all the original Jo episodes. I'm not sure why she was replaced. I do hope that is covered on this or one of the future sets. I'd be nice of Shannon actually joined the rest of the cast in a Look Back featurette. I don't know if she'll be there nor would I actually count of it. But in my opinion, Shannon was the best Jo. As for the second Jo, had Shannon remained or came back to the show, the second Jo could have been someone new so there would be 4 Borgs - 2 guys and 2 girls. All the monsters were fu ny I. Their own way. But Flabber was insanely funny lol!",1344816000,,628,3.9140625

5165163,3,B008HUSFIE,"My six year old was enthralled by this mixture of Frankenstein and insectoid robots.

5165174,4,B008HUSFIE,"It's dated and one can tell it's mainly for kids, but it's still a fun and cute show.  It made me nostalgic for the early '90s when this along with shows like the earlier Power Rangers and cartoons like Batman: the animated series was on.  Good action show for kids without showing extreme violence...unless one counts fantasy explosions.",1390953600,,338,4.810344827586207

5165181,2,B008HUSFIE,"Haim Saban and Shuki Levy owned the 90's much in the same way Sid & Marty Krofft owned the 70's, make no mistake. Everything they touched turned to gold. Digimon, Spiderman, X-men, Power Rangers, why it's enough to make King Midas seethe with jealously.

But then their main cash cow Power Rangers started to droop by the wayside in the ratings department and they began to look elsewhere for well of steady cash. So they imported once again from the land of the rising sun and got to work. The results were, shall we say, less than desirable.

First there was VR Troopers, a once intially planned gateway show for Jason David Frank's acting career after he ended his tenure as the Green Ranger. Then there was Masked Rider, the less said about that the better and then, Beetleborgs.

The premise is as follows: Three ""average joe"" children who love comic books stumble into a haunted house on a dare and free an Elvis impersonator ghoul who moonlights as a genie from his prison in a piano organ. As a reward, he imbues them with the likeness of their favorite superheroes, the Big Bad Beetleborgs (Red Striker, Blue Stinger, and Green Hunter respectively). However, this also results in the freeing of the Beetleborg's arch villians, the Magnavores and their treacherous hordes of no good nicks. To further combat these foes, the children are also given individual superpowers such as telekinesis, super speed, and super strength.

While it seems like a brilliant idea in theory, combining monster movies with comic books and children's natural love of insects, it falls incredibly short. Namely in the writing department (cringe worthy dialogue be damned). This had to due with another internal issue that Saban was going through, ""Do we write serious or comedic shows?"". The best example of this is Power Rangers Turbo, which decided to follow it's source material's (Gekisou Sentai Carranger) lead with devastating results.

So was this show the victim of unfair treatment by it's writing staff? I think a standing ovation of ""YES"" at the highest octave possible is in order.",1363910400,,2080,4.914529914529915
5165182,5,B008HUSFIE,I used to love this show when it came on and watching it now just reminds me how much I loved it.,1361145600,,97,3.4545454545454546
5165193,5,B008HUSFIE,"grew up with this series and happy to see it's finally on dvd and unlike some peeps i haven't watched on netflix beforehand so yes, im happy with this but my only complaint is that this volume leaves us off in the middle of the shadowborg saga (and the next one is going to leave us off in the middle of the metallix one)",1359244800,,321,4.03125
5165194,5,B008HUSFIE,"I got Big Bad Beetleborgs for my pre-birthday present to me from me,and it once again brought back childhood memories. Along with Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad,and VR Troopers, I was in high school when these shows were on t.v.,and they were well enjoyed. Even though I still hear about these shows being campy and corny,and that I'm the only one who watches stuff like this. In truth I'm not the only one ,shows like this have been popular in the U.S and Japan since the 1970's. And not to mention in the U.S. in California there ,is an annual Power Pangers and Tokusatsu Convention Called PowerMorphicon.",1357257600,,637,4.8

5165196,5,B008HUSFIE,If you like the 90's cartoon then your gonna like this show is like power rangers but it has comedy and action.,1354492800,,111,4.090909090909091
5165197,4,B008HUSFIE,"Struggling to solidify an identity for itself, Beetleborgs was always under constant scrutiny living in the shadow of its big brother, Power Rangers. The Curse of the Shadowborg Saga unlocked the true potential the Borgs needed to break free from the burden of comparison, but unfortunately it was released too late to save their rapidly sinking ship.

With increased character development from the young stars, a more action packed plot, and decent SFX (for the time), Curse of the Shadowborg ushered in a new era for the Beetleborgs. The episode also introduced one of the series' best villains to date, Shadowborg, a classic blend of Darth Vader ambiance and Clint Eastwood one-liners.

Though the Shadowborg Saga did have its downsides, mainly the introduction of the character, Josh, and all the plot twists that came with him, it was a small price to pay to see the refined beast that Big Bad Beetleborgs could have been.

It's really too bad Beetleborgs wasn't given another season or two to establish their fan base, but at least they had enough time to deliver their masterpiece, The Curse of the Shadowborg Saga.",1350345600,5,1122,4.957446808510638

5165199,5,B008HUSFIE,"I had never seen this series back in the 1990's so watching this was fun, as I always enjoy seeing new television series'. The series itself had a good story line and while some of the characters were a bit over the top, that's what makes the series as fun as it was. One of the things that I liked best was that it brought me back to when I was a kid reading comics. Each time I picked up a comic I wished that I too could find the mutant M on my hand as I got older. This series showed three kids who had their dream come true. The other thing that was great about this was that you had the chance to see the first 27 episodes, and while there will be more that will be coming, this was a great first start!",1348444800,,709,3.863013698630137

8528254,1,B008HUSFIE,"The Big Bad Beetleborgs are a ruination of the original B-Fighter. Imagine prepubescent individuals wanting to be the characters of a fictitious comic book series LOOSELY based on an ACTUAL japanese superhero show, and going to a haunted mansion to become those characters. It's all wrong!

Worst part is: The green guy was originally the strongman of the group, while the red ""girl"" had better speed. In Beetleborgs, that wasn't the case (the girl had super strength while the guy in green had Super Speed). And since the closing credits had the haunted house monsters all the time, this show is more of a ""Creatures of the Night"" show than a superhero show >:-(",1455062400,,663,4.815789473684211

8528257,5,B008HUSFIE,very underrated show at first it was a little cheesy but after a while watching some episodes it does get better. Some episodes are pretty good for example the episode i liked the most is the one with the shadowborg. Kind of similar to the green with evil episode in power rangers. Another episode i liked is when the kids go to the comic con convention a lot because of the cameos of superheroes from different shows. If you give this series a chance you might like it. I give the first 27 episodes of this volume an overall rating of 7/10 some good episodes and not some good ones.,1443916800,2,583,4.3090909090909095
