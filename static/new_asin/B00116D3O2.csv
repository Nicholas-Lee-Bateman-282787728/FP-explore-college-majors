I do think a little more effort could've gone into the play menu & overall video quality, but considering how old this movie is, I'm not complaining too much. The songs are still as fun & catchy as I remembered them, & I surprised myself with just how well I remember them. I'd love to see this series reintroduced today, or at least more easily available. The price was a bit steep, too. Overall, though, I'm happy with the purchase & would do it again.",1516838400,,562,4.261682242990654

8240760,5,B00116D3O2,"Reminds me of when I was a child.  I loved this and to this day remember some of the songs.  I highly recommend this video to other parents.  Most children love it and the songs are very catchy.
Good Summary:
Brand new as expected.
Ships in safe packaging for the DVD.

Bad Summary:
The video keeps playing over and over and over again.  It does not end until you shut it off.  After the 7th time, I start losing my mind.  lol",1437264000,,426,4.121951219512195
