8687865,5,B00PH1H62M,"Important note to buyers: This product is a Region 2 DVD. Which means that to view it properly, the best solution would be to either buy a Region free DVD player or to download a free software called VLC player. A wonderful software which has allowed me to view on my computer or laptop movies from all over the world.

For this part of the third season of ""Shaun the Sheep"", new episodes under the StudioCanal DVD release. Storylines like ""Wild Life"" where a cameraman finds more juicy material inside Shaun's flock than what some producer and host intend to record, ""The Pelican"" whose title character makes quite a scene on the farm. But my favourite in this set is and remains ""Phoney Farmer"". Where Bitzer's owner, while going on holiday, is replaced by a young farmer whose behaviour is an unprofessional fraud.

Finally, as an extra feature, this DVD presents five episodes from the new ""Morph"" series that the public co-funded with Aardman through the Kickstarter website. Which is nice as I didn't knew the charcter before and now can't wait to see the Dvd release of all the episodes from that production.

As such, this DVD offers wonderful episodes to keep up the patience before the ""Shaun the Sheep"" film release.",1437696000,2,1227,4.751173708920188
