8205753,5,B000SL3V84,"I've always liked the look of M3 Grant/Lee tank. I don't know what it is exactly perhaps it's unique appearance, or the 75mm main gun being mounted in that side sponson, or just the fact that it was part of the Allied arsenal during the popular North African Campaign of WWII. Either way it was an important tank design and I'm very glad to see a documentary made about it. It was done extremely well as are all of these ""Killer Tanks"" series DVD's (from the same people who did the Scorched Earth DVD Series). I just really hope to see a ""Killer Tanks"" DVD about the Crusader tank next! If you are into World War II or military history in general, or even scale model building (of military subjects) then I'm sure you will enjoy this DVD. Excellent quality, great footage, nice touches of CGI animation, just an overall excellent DVD on an important tank from World War II.",1193011200,3,874,4.46875
