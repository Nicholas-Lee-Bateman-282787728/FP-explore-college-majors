2470025,5,B000CQPZ8E,This is a great work out. Especially  for the arms. There is not as much cardio as I was hoping for but overall still a great sweat producing workout.,1379894400,,150,4.172413793103448
2470026,5,B000CQPZ8E,Love these workouts as they really seem to do the trick and have gotten me into shape very fast and I am a veteran exerciser! Many reps and low weights are the answer if you want to be lean and mean instead of bulky and as that is what most women prefer I recommend this. There are many repetitions but that is how it works guys and instead of complaining that it is boring just do it and see the results as I have. Overall she is a great instructor but not perfect as you will find with most exercise DVDs but she delivers if people will just do the workout and give it a chance. Remember that if you are overweight and out of shape it is not Debbies fault that you find this hard to do but its like anything else you have to do what it takes and not give up. I love this and highly recommend.,1372982400,,794,3.96875
2470027,5,B000CQPZ8E,"OMG....this dvd really worked you out, I was so winded/felt so good at the same time. I LOVE the ""Slim in 6"" series. I'm going to
purchase more. Love you Ms. Siebers and Slim in 6! It's worth it to me.",1363996800,3,201,3.926829268292683
2470028,5,B000CQPZ8E,"If anyone does this for the required time, they will definately get a great workout.  No question, they will lose weight.  Just have to do it.",1360022400,,142,4.423076923076923
2470029,5,B000CQPZ8E,I bought as a gift for my granddaughter and she loves it.  It gives her the workout she likes with alot of variety.,1356739200,,115,4.0
2470030,5,B000CQPZ8E,"I wasn't looking forward to trying this workout video only because I was disappointed with Debbie's ""Keep it Up"" dvd. I thought ""Keep it Up"" was too similar to the original ""Slim in 6"" workout and was bored with it quickly. I pushed myself to try this workout and was very glad I did.

A lot of the workout is familiar, but this time Debbie adds in newer exercises, especially for the chest and triceps, a little more cardio and less focus on the mat legwork exercises (which was hard on my knees anyway) from the previous dvds and a lot more work with resistance bands. I'm not a fan of the bands, I just use my weights. I like that it's basically a low-impact workout for the entire body.

One more note, it's a bit lengthy at 57 minutes, but (for me) it goes by quickly. As I've noted in other reviews of the Slim series, I turn off the music and work out to my own playlist.

Overall, I really enjoyed this workout. I would say skip ""Keep it Up"" and move on to ""Mix it Up"" instead.",1348444800,3,985,4.173684210526316
2470031,4,B000CQPZ8E,"But they also look seriously toned! I've done The Firm, Jillian Michaels workouts, Slim in 6, and P90X. With the Slim Series, however, I am dramatically toning up. This DVD, Mix It Up, bills itself as being ""less intense"" as some of the other Slim Series videos (ie. Tone It Up, Shape It Up, or Tear It Up). Don't think you're getting off light! I sweat during those workouts, but I am sopping wet by the end of Mix It Up.

What I love about Mix It Up is that the nearly hour long workout flies by. You move from one move to the next in a way that gives one part of your body relief, but keeps your heart rate up. Since Debbie switches from lower body to upper body, you're definitely going to feel the burn. And speaking of burn, you'll do a series of moves with dumbbells and think ""wow, that was freakin' tough"" and then she'll ask you to pick up the resistance bands. WOWSA. You will feel it and you WILL tone all over.

I would definitely recommend Mix It Up and other Slim Series products. My advice, however, is to pace yourself. I'm not a veteran to working out by any means, but these workouts are definitely not for newbie exercisers! Go at your own pace, listen to your body. Push pause if you need to, especially for water in this workout since Debbie doesn't give an official ""water break"" in any of her workouts. Modify, modify, modify if you're feeling any pain. Enjoy!",1335139200,14,1384,4.319230769230769
2470032,5,B000CQPZ8E,"This is a great video for people who are new to working out.  She goes slow enough, and tells you to go at your own pace.  I've since moved on (this was no longer intense enough), but it was very helpful in losing pregnancy weight.",1334880000,,231,4.111111111111111
2470033,5,B000CQPZ8E,I'm up at 4:30 am to work out - and Debbie is always a pleasure to deal with that early!  The work out is excellent.,1295654400,,116,3.64
8100606,5,B000CQPZ8E,"Great workout! About an hour in length. Lots of different moves that work many muscle groups. Love the count down timer on Debbies dvds, so helpful! I have several of Debbies dvds. This one didn't disappoint!",1525996800,,208,4.805555555555555
8100607,5,B000CQPZ8E,Finally got around to working out with Debbie and let me tell you this dvd is awesome.  I have all of her other dvds and this one is just as good.,1464912000,,146,3.7096774193548385
8100608,5,B000CQPZ8E,tough workout,1450051200,,13,6.0
8100609,4,B000CQPZ8E,"Good mix that engages entire body, warm up, strech, cardio, strength, and cool down with 30 mintues.",1437523200,,100,4.9411764705882355
8100610,4,B000CQPZ8E,Good weighted workout.  Make it easier with lighter weights or more challenging with heavier ones.  I wish the music was more inspiring though.,1416355200,,143,5.173913043478261
8100611,5,B000CQPZ8E,Love the exercises!,1413763200,,19,5.666666666666667
8100612,4,B000CQPZ8E,Not bad. Good to change up the pace.,1407974400,,36,3.625
8100613,3,B000CQPZ8E,"I really like doing Debbie's videos however, this one starts out with doing weights and never seems to end without holding a weight in your hand..Don't get me wrong I love doing my routines with weights but this is a bit of a challenge for me especially early in the morning. I don't know why this wasn't mentioned in the first few reviews that I read, anyway I like to let people know what to expect; It is a a great video though..",1405814400,6,432,4.216867469879518
8100614,5,B000CQPZ8E,"I love this workout and was pleased with the amount of arm workout in it and how it is mixed up along with legs, abs, cardio and stretching.  Well done!",1402704000,3,152,4.066666666666666
8100615,5,B000CQPZ8E,"I love this workout DVD.  It works out every muscle, and it can be as tough or as easy as you like, depending on how much effort you put into it.  Debbie is a great instructor; not annoying or overly chatty.  And it is obvious that she is working too!  The moves are well-choreographed and easy to follow.  Yes, it is an hour long, but one of my absolute FAVORITE things about this workout series are the countdown clocks!  And when I say ""clocks"", it is because there is not only a countdown clock for the particular segment you are on, there is also a clock that lets you know how much longer the whole workout will be.  I love this!  And along the right hand side of the screen is yet another ""countdown"": colored ovals that light up as you get to that segment, then go transparent when you are done.  So encouraging!  Even when I don't ""feel"" like exercising, I find myself thinking ""I can just do one more segment"", or ""There are only 2 minutes left in this part""...and before I know it, I finish the whole thing.  SO GLAD I found this!",1402531200,4,1041,4.260204081632653
