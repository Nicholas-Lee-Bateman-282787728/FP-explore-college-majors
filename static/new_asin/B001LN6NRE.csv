3688167,4,B001LN6NRE,"not bad......like everyone else i bought this at Wal-Mart in the $5 bin......pretty good deal for the price....i have one question though....whats with the guy""s mustache!!!!!!  I mean jeeeeez!!!!!!!  Trim that thing.  I was more scared of that then anything else......trust me you'll know what im talking about when you see it......

My suggestion is to pay the $5 and get it at Wal-Mart instead of here",1238976000,2,404,4.985074626865671
3688168,3,B001LN6NRE,"...and it was worth every penny. You only get what you pay for, right?

The 5-star reviews and the 1-star reviews for those are both a joke, it's not terrible and it's CERTAINLY not perfect. You just kind of have to ask yourself why you plan on watching this.  If you're looking for new insight into the mind of serial killers, there is nothing new to see or hear here. If you're looking for plenty of videos of the killers being interviewed or appearances in court or old news reels or whatever... well, there's SOME of that, but for the most part it's mainly clips that are available on youtube with narration over top. If you're looking for a look at a lot of obscure killers and not just the big names, well, honestly there are a few here or there that I was surprised about (I rarely see Albert Fish get mentioned elsewhere, and there were a few killer couples on the ""buddies"" segment that hardly ever get talked about).

If you're looking for high production values, sorry!  While everything is competently-filmed and -edited, the creators of this made the mistake of interviewing the same 2 or 3 people for the entire 7 1/2 hours.  So, if you don't like 1 of them (or all of them), you're out of luck... get used to seeing 'em over and over again!  Also, if you're looking for something comprehensive, forget it.  Did it even MENTION the Manson Family killing Sharon Tate?!  Either I fell asleep for that brief part or they just skimmed right over it and started talking about the media's role in the Manson case.

The narration is great; don't let the other reviewers fool you, and the narrator himself doesn't do the voices of the killers, they have separate people doing the voices, and it works just fine. The soundtrack is amazing if you care about that when watching a documentary.  The whole thing held my interest with no problem, even though I knew all of this stuff. There actually were a few tidbits here or there that I'd never heard before, and I've read plenty of true crime books and watch truTV/CourtTV religiously.

One nitpick: Every single disc starts with the same 3 minute ""title sequence"", with a reenactment of a fat cowboy getting shot and clips of Hitler and such. The same exact 3 minute title sequence.  While it's easy to skip past, it was extremely annoying. Oh, and as for ""showing clips of old movies"", yeah, they do that on the first couple of segments, but it's not like they could have shown ACTUAL CLIPS from the late 1800s, now could they?

I enjoyed this thing for what it is, and I think it actually probably would be a good introduction to people just getting into serial killers, especially for $5. I will say, disc 2 is WAY better than disc 1.  So, 5 stars for the price if you can get it cheap, 2 stars of the production values, 3 stars of the content... 3 stars overall.",1236211200,56,2821,4.473684210526316
3688169,3,B001LN6NRE,"I picked this up from Wal Mart in the $5 DVD bin. I figured it was a good deal, 7 hours of content on the cheap. I bought it expecting an A&E or History Channel documentary, but it ended up being a fairly amateurish, low budget affair. The narrator is fairly competent until he tries to give a voice to the killers, which he often does. Most of the footage is from old movies and there's very little in terms of actual pictures or accounts from the actual murders.

It's a decent time killer, interesting enough to keep me watching, but far from the portrait it advertises itself as.

3 stars, if you can pick it up on the cheap.",1236124800,2,629,4.233333333333333
3688170,2,B001LN6NRE,"I pre-ordered this DVD set believing to finally have a comprehensive study of the nature of criminality pertaining to serial killing. What I found was a rather farcical and puerile rendition of a ""documentary"".
The narration is very annoying (lousy and childish voice impressions of the serial killers themselves interspersed throughout), some of the criminology experts exhibit an air of pomp and grandiosity (the guy from Rhode Island University was very full of himself), and the overall content is not featured in an objective fashion (very annoying-I do not like for others to make up my mind for me). The section on Jack the Ripper was a joke (since when did feature films from the 1940's stand for documented fact)?
I bought this set expecting a very academic and detailed study of the hows and whys of a serial killer's nature; instead, I find simple name-calling and criticism of the serial killers' acts by the narrator and the panel of experts, stupid music, and the same lame intro with the fat cowboy and Romulus killing Remus over and over again! I did find the section on H H Holmes interesting-hence the two stars.",1234915200,8,1130,4.860103626943006
3688171,2,B001LN6NRE,"What a disappointment.  The facts are slim.  Old movies are passed off as representations of the crimes.  In the Jack the Ripper segment, for example, we have lengthy scenes from inaccurate 1930s films.  But by far the worst is the stupid music (that screech from ""Psycho"") and the even stupider, more banal narration.

The ""experts"" who tell us about the killers are strutting, preening dolts who think that putting a label on something (e.g., the urge to kill) explains it.  The killers are psychopaths, sociopaths, we hear from the self styled scholars of crime.  So what?  That doesn't explain anything or add one iota to our understanding.  It would be better to leave all that out and just give the facts.  I've seen TV programs that do a far better job of telling what happened.

Skip this set of DVDs.  Someone will surely do this subject better.",1234396800,4,854,4.73469387755102
3688172,5,B001LN6NRE,"While the production value is not the greatest , the content is the best. In the end the serial killer remains a mystery",1233273600,,120,4.260869565217392
3688173,1,B001LN6NRE,"When I found this new item set for release in January '09 I thought perhaps -- just perhaps -- there might be current, up-to-date insight and information.  At a minimum, I expected some commentary by multiple discipline-leading experts, or even statements by people directly impacted by the actions of serial killers.  Shoot, even some actual news clips would have been nice.  After watching the first 5 minutes (and witnessing the hilarious death of the fat cowboy, hehe), I had to triple-check the release date on the box & on Amazon's page to make sure it truly read ""2009"" instead of ""1989.""  The acting is poor, 95% of the material is outdated filler, and the narrator is horrible at best (he's proudly vapid at times, such as when tele-channeling the Zodiac Killer on the phone).  If you get beyond all of that, you'll then notice that much of the information about the murders is inaccurate (i.e. Charles Manson).  Lastly, as your mind and eyes start to wander, you'll see the black sheet hanging behind the interviewees is not even ironed ..... those wrinkles and creases summarily symbolize the sloppy production values throughout.

This 2-disc set had so much potential, considering the producers bravely selected a few killers who are no longer well known, like William Heirens (The Lipstick Killer) and Jane Toppan.  But, in the end, this is NOT for anyone interested in a mature and accurate historical account  (maybe hysterical).  In a way this whole thing is sad because the makers of this DVD-set don't seem to realize just how bad it is (on NO level does Gein's murder of his brother have anything to do with Cain & Abel -- what a crazy stretch!).

The poor gals & blokes wasted their money by making this ""documentary.""  To prevent a second crime, do not buy this item.  Save your money and look elsewhere, wise buyers ... look elsewhere (and don't spend more than $5 if you really want to buy it).  On the other hand,  If you wish to view a clever and unique perspective on how and why we kill, there's not much better than Dr. Michael H. Stone's ""Most Evil"" DVD series.",1233187200,9,2090,4.7032967032967035

3688217,3,B001LN6NRE,"I paid $5 for this two-disc set and given each of the ten episodes goes for about 40 minutes it's a fair price. The first 3-4 episodes on Disc 1 are pretty ordinary and as there isn't exactly much footage of those American serial killers like Jack The Ripper (do Mill Creek know something we don't? Unlikely) they pad those episodes out with footage of old black & white movies making them laughably amateurish. But like others have said stick with it as the Zodiac episode and most of the episodes on Disc 2 are really interesting.

Yes, they use the same 3-4 talking head 'serial killer experts' in every episode but you wouldn't expect fresh ones each episode and the narrator's voice is quite annoying along with him occasionally voicing the serial killers which are unintentionally hilarious but all up for around $5 you can't ask for much more than you get.

Just make sure you skip the same mind-numbing 3 and a half minute intro before each episode, I can certainly live without hearing the narrator say Cain slew Abel and Romulus slew Remus again that's for sure.",1399161600,,1072,4.636842105263158

3688223,5,B001LN6NRE,"I thoroughly enjoyed this documentary on evil killers of our time and prior to us. It is very interesting how some of the killers had a horrible upbringing but some of them lived seemingly normal lives. You can never know who the person next to you really is. Someone that can seem so normal can be so frightening. Its kind of a look into how these people trick society into believing they would never do such things as are being charged against them. Then there are other killers that are quite obvious and were no surprise once they were caught. Overall, if you have an interest in questioning those among us wondering if you got a strange feeling about the creepy guy across the room, you will definitely enjoy buying this disc.",1380499200,,731,4.545454545454546

Critical information about all these serial killers, along with credible interviews with people can support the documentary. The documentaries, however, can be a little boring because the narrator can sometimes be dull. I would recommend this set of DVD's to anybody seriously wanting to learn about the truth of these serial killers, as this set does cover a lot. I am not dissatisfied with the product at all, it is a good buy and good for learning.

RECOMMENDATION: I do recommend this product to any buyers serious in knowing the true stories of these serial killers mentioned on this set. Good for a high school or college teacher to have handy.

3688241,3,B001LN6NRE,"The cult of serial killers is such a loser cult - they alway portray them as these intelligent, interesting conflicted people who are kind of sexy and subversive, but it's the opposite. They're just like cunning predators like a cat or dog, they've been doing what lower forms of life have been doing forever. Boring, predictable and cruel. some jerk is programming us all for killing, cruelty and death. Whee - not. You can get all your kicks from deep play you don't need this crap. Intelligence is the opposite of this - not to lose life, trust, liberty, kindness, respect or love. Excitement - the ultimate excitement would be eternal life, love and fulfillment of dreams. Cure death, the opposite of the atomic bomb. Love so intensely and life-givingly that it cannot be denied. Loving is the most exciting thing you'll every have. I'm so tired of serial killer this and that, all this culture of death sold as sex. Death is not sexy, I had someone in my life die and there's nothing good about it. All his beauty and strength, compassion and goodness gone - all his vibrance and potential gone. Infinitely boring. Infinitely cruel, to betray the innocents trust and love and sell them death. Religion is a death and torture cult, predator culture of fast food cruel use of animals and death, death death. Sell life for a change, I'd buy it. Challenge you to make it exciting, it won't be hard when your competition is this crap. Save animals from pain and harm, save us all from it, invent the opposite of everything they have. This is only good to know what a tool using predator is like so you can hopefully avoid them.",1308960000,,1627,4.613793103448276
3688242,3,B001LN6NRE,"I think it would be unfair to give this DVD set only 1 star out of 5. We have to remember that Mill Creek Entertainment is a small production company with a low budget, so of course the product won't be perfect. Also this DVD set is less than 10$, another proof that we shouldn't have high expectations about this product.
But I have to say that this is a good DVD Set. I have over 80 books about True Crimes/Serial Killers/Unsolved Cases so of course I didn't learn anything new ( and yes, some of the informations in the documentary are wrong ) but I think that Mill Creek did a good job. This is not one of their best documentaries ( ""america's 60 greatest unsolved mysteries and crimes"" and ""Vegas: The city the mob made"" are way better ) but it's still a good watch, and 5+ hours of documentary for less than 10$ is really good. There's not a lot of Documentaries about Serial Killers available on DVDs and I agree that this one is far from being perfect, but it's still a good buy. If you want something a little better I would recommand ""Crimes of the Century"", a 2 DVD set available here on Amazon for less than 15$.

The cases featured in the documentary are:
Program 1 - The Case of Jack the Ripper
Program 2 - H.H.Holmes and Jane Toppan
Program 3 - Albert Fish, the Vampire of Brooklyn
Program 4 - The Boston Strangler, Ed Gein and the Lipstick Killer
Program 5 - The Zodiac, the Son of Sam, Charles Manson and Ted Bundy
Program 6 - John Wayne Gacy and the Highway Killers
Program 7 - The Hillside Stranglers and the Beltway Snipers
Program 8 - The Gainesville Ripper, the Unabomber and others
Program 9 - The Green River Killer and BTK
Program 10 - The Night Stalker and Jeffrey Dahmer",1308441600,,1697,4.303125
3688243,4,B001LN6NRE,"If you have already seen most of the infamous cases,you might be bored with this dvd. Most of the cases were shown on the History channel and A&E.It's still interesting to watch. There are still many cases presented that could be connected,yet the dvd makes no connection between them. I would like to see a dvd that shows lesser known cases,such as the 'Killer Nuns' or the 'Killer Clowns'.Or the case of Ethel George and her lesibian sidekick,Rita Crawford. Or even the the most bizzare case of Shirley Stuart. Shirley was suspected in the gruesome murders of her whole family,during the summer of 1961. Her brother-in-law went to the dentist,when he returned,his wife and brother were found brutally killed. And Shirley's six children were also found murdered. The police were able to lift her fingerprints from the various toys,that Shirley used as the murder weapons. And the police can't say for sure,Shirley had done the crimes againts her family. Because Shirley Stuart was missing and her whereabouts remain unknown to this day. Some believe Shirley was the victim of domestic abuse and wanted a new life. Others believe Shirley snapped and later committed suicide. Others believe Shirley was forced to watch the murders of her family and was abducted away. And even others believe still that Shirley and a lesbian lover planned the whole event,and lived out their lives under false identities. If Shirley Stuart is alive,she would be around eighty-four years old today. In the case of Ethel George and Rita Crawford,they were the real 'Arsenic and Old Lace'.Presumed guilty in at least eight murders,they were sentenced to life in prison. During 1939 through 1941,they coaxed and tricked various suitors into signing life insurance policies over to Ethel or Rita. A private investigator ,with city detectives, was able to search Ethal's house and find a mummified victim,in the attic,stuffed in a steamer-trunk. Ethel recanted,'He refused to sign,so we knock him over the head'.Ethal escaped ,while being transferred from prisons,one month after her arrest. She was re-arrested,the next month,and Ethel was even planning her new beau's murder. Rita,Ethal's original accomplice,remained in prison until 1988. Rita died there ,at the age of eighty-eight. Ethel George had long ago died of cancer,in 1958. A man named Chris Hanson ,has a video collection of ancient 8mm films,showing the murderers and their victims,during happier good times. I wish he would write a book or even develope a dvd,fully explaining the various gruesome murders. So many bizzare cases are largely unknown. What could have caused these normal looking folks to stoop to a base murderous level,would make intesting discussion and debate for the readers and the viewers. Since the days of the cavemen,mankind has been enthralled by 'bloodlust'.Thesedays, society channels that killer urge through sports and recreation events. These cases,show how mankind's civility has progressed slowly,and can easily regress into barbarism.",1304380800,,3009,5.323529411764706

3688245,3,B001LN6NRE,"For the money this is a decent overview and examination of serial killers. This is simply a lower to low budget project. I think I got my money's worth. A better examination and analysis would have cost a lot more. The series used movies in some cases, as in Jack The Ripper. The most ridiculous aspect of the collection was in how the narrator tried to imitate the voices of various serial killers when he was using their dialogue. I'd say this is a good buy for anyone who pays about ten dollars. Hopefully there is an even better series out there that examines serial killers. Footage of the actual killers was very interesting. Footage of some of the Manson women was also a real treat. I know there is a lot more that exists of the Manson killings.",1285372800,,753,4.424460431654676
3688246,3,B001LN6NRE,"I purchased this dvd thinking it would be more personable than it is.  The first disc, especially the first half to 3/4, is bland and almost boring to where I was tempted to take it out.  The rest of the disc and the second disc is where the more recent serial killers are talked about so it makes relating to them and the information easier and more enjoyable.  Overall I gave the whole 2 disc set 3 stars out of 5 and would call it an average buy, even for a serial killer aficionado.",1277337600,2,486,4.148936170212766
3688247,2,B001LN6NRE,"I did not get it from Walmart, I actually got it from Best Buy for about twice as much, and I regret each of those nine hundred and ninety nine cents. Two stars may be a bit too much for this ""production"".

First, this is a very very repetitive, having an almost five minutes introduction, identical on each of the episodes, what, made more concise, would have made its running time already an episode shorter. After that, the narrative is terribly repetitive, gets to similar simplistic conclusions for each of the serial killers they ""analyze"", goes on and on over pointless arguments, making forced pauses that make it feel very sensationalist.

With all the repetition on it, it really does not tell you much about the individuals they analyze, even referring to their victims as ""the less dead"" because they were in marginal parts of society, and thus, they were ""less alive"" before they were killed. When they talk about the ""buddy serial killers"", they say that ""the partners turn on each other, like the animals they were"", or that ""this or that other serial killer was bad from the beginning"", and similar statements that try to drive the attention away from the lack of substance to the sensationalized gruesomeness of their crimes.

Finally, there are gross inaccuracies on the contents of this ""documentary"". I have to admit, serial killers is one of those topics I like to study as a hobby, and I have read over a dozen books on the topic, and watch many more documentaries that are in general consistent with each other and refute some minor and not so minor points exposed here.

My advise, don't waste your money on this.",1270166400,10,1637,4.733333333333333

Sure the intro is always the same, and sure the same three guys are interviwed throughout the entire thing, but the information they give you is pretty interesting. Depending on what you know of the serial killers that are listed in this 7 1/2 DVD you may or may not learn something new. It has it's highs and it's lows, but again I only paid $5 for it. I wasn't expecting too much, so in my mind I got more than I paid for. If you're interested in serial killers, or you know someone that is, it's a pretty interesting dvd.

3688250,3,B001LN6NRE,"i bought this in best buy for $10 it was enjoyable and not the worst or best i have ever seen. I really wanted to add that since it was called AMERICAN serial killers was it necessary to add jack the ripper. A quick reference would be sufficient but an entire episode is dedicated solely to the the ripper. Other Killers in the series have to split screen time and share episodes like gacy and dahmer. Also not one mention of Edmund Kemper?? come on really?? An hour on the jack the ripper and nothing on kemper in that sense it was a total rip off. Also some of the reenactments were hoakey. A more comprehensive set on serial killers would be nice to see but i guess you get what you pay for.
P.S. im glad this set doesn't glorify killers but tries to take an academic approach on the subject  Kudos",1246838400,2,801,4.235294117647059
3688251,2,B001LN6NRE,"I, too, got this at Wal-Mart for $5.  The 1st episode played fine (yes, the intro is over the top & it feels silly based on the title to start with a British serial killer but whatever), but the 2nd episode started hanging & eventually froze completely.  None of the other shows would play, & disc 2 was the same way.

I took it back to Wal-Mart to exchange, & the new set won't play, either disc.  I've successfully ripped the 1st disc to my hard drive but the 2nd has unrecoverable errors, so I will take THIS one back as well and try for a 3rd set to get a readable 2nd disc.

If I ever get a copy that will play, I will review the content.  This is ridiculous!  I'm a bit surprised nobody's mentioned issues with trying to get the discs to play.  Am I just really unlucky?

Hopefully the 3rd time's the charm...",1244419200,4,815,4.140127388535032
3688252,1,B001LN6NRE,"Yes, I bought it at Walmart for five bucks too. Which I thought was a bargain price even if it didn't turn out to be all that good. I was wrong. This collection is not even worth that much.

I literally cried through the whole thing. Either because the voice-over was so terribly hilarious, or because of all the innacuracies that were presented as utter truth. This whole DVD comes off as something smashed together by someone who has only done the slightest bit of surface research on the subject matter and then padded the whole thing with vaguely related clips. Such was the case with H. H. Holmes. The only media to be found are some pictures and news-clippings, no movie was made about his killings. So what is used when focusing on him? Clips from an old movie that might have been what meeting the man was like?

Skip this one. It's not a good introduction to the subject matter, it's not a good representation of the history of it. You're better off keeping that 8 or 5 bucks and treating yourself to lunch.

Edit: I'm not sure how I can make this any clearer. This DVD is filled with FALSE FACTS. Underline that sentence. Bold it. Make it flash and scroll across the screen. Give it a little ""DING!"" sound effect when the words load on the screen. This DVD is riddled with outright false information, misleading statements, and sensationalist speculation with just enough of the truth to get away with it. Wikipedia has more accurate information when it's being hacked by 13-year-old trolls.

!<~*~This DVD lies to you.~*~>!

This is not a good source of information. This is not even a good place to start learning about serial killers no matter how cheap it is, because it will build a base of assumptions that flat out are not true. This DVD wants you to believe the world is flat when all the evidence and experts are telling you it's round.

I just went to YouTube and searched for ""serial killer documentary."" There are PAGES of entire documentaries on there. They're free. They're better produced and better informed. Go there to learn if you don't want to pick up the written documents on the cases! Just don't waste a single cent or second on this absolute mess of a DVD.

P.S. Why is a British serial killer the first study on a DVD with ""America's"" in the title?",1242000000,22,2283,4.54014598540146
3688253,4,B001LN6NRE,i agree with adam this is a good buy at wal mart out ofthe five dollar bin but the amazon price isn't bad bad for the length of this 2 disc set. this is all info you probably already have if you're into true crime but still not a bad buy. i would have to say for the earlier featured kilers they used too much of related movie footage for filler. the interviews and narration are done well with the exception of when the narrator reads letters from the killers in their voices. this is so terrible its funny. at times i was convinced i was listening to richard dreyfuss until i heard those awful voices. buy this if you like this kind of thing. for under ten dollars you get 7 hrs of info and footage of over 20 cases. and interviews with some of the minds who have studied the subject extensively. even dr jack levin of MSNBC crime documentary fame gets in on the action. the price makes this worth it.,1242000000,3,903,4.195402298850575
3688254,2,B001LN6NRE,"This is called American Serial Killers, yet spends over an hour discussing Jack the Ripper. It's understandable to want to open with Ripper, but analyzing Hollywood film footage for over an hour is just too long off topic and not the kind of analysis I was looking for. The Ted Bundy story was glossed over and none of the extremely creepy crap he did with his dead ""souvenirs"" revealed. If the narrator is going to over emphasize the word ""gay"" serial killer as though the sexuality some how makes the crime more chilling then ""hetero"" serial killer should be equally dramatized repeatedly. Finally Eileen Wuornos was not made into an antihero in the film Monster. It's just she's not a sexual predator.  She did not kill for the joy of killing nor did she kill or torture for sexual gratification. She doesn't decapitate heads of men and skull fvk them long after they've decomposed. If you want a history of Jack the Ripper films, very little truth about Ted Bundy and trust an analysis who doesn't understand the difference between serial killing and sexual predatory serial killing this film is for you.",1241654400,5,1108,4.770833333333333

reviewers as to the very poor production quality and the repetition. First of all, the Jack The Ripper segment was way too long and ventured into unrelated areas. And yes, Jack The Ripper was in London. Why he was included in ""America's Serial Killers"" is beyond me. Secondly, each chapter begins with the exact same, lengthy introduction. Finally, the use of movie segments and analysis afterward are totally unnecessary and ten to stray off topic and serve as nothing but useless filler.
