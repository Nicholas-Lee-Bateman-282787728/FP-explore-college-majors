1649573,5,B00005QW5X,"definatley an excellent movie. I won't write a book about it or anything, but the casting, cinematography, music, lyrics, animation and story are all great. That can't be said about many other movies. Take my word and see it if you can.",996451200,,236,4.642857142857143
1649574,4,B00005QW5X,"John Cameron Mitchell's ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" proposes the age-old question:  Who Am I? and ""What is My Place on this Earth?""  How Mitchell answers this question is at the very nature of the brilliance of this story told through 70's style ""hair"" rock.  The world of Hedwig runs much deeper and is examined more thoroughly than say that of ""The Rocky Horror Show,"" which this film resembles.  But in reality Hedwig is more like the rags-to-riches story of Fanny Brice in ""Funny Girl.""  Mitchell not only directs but is the star and he does a bang-up job creating a world and then inhabiting it.  Mitchell is such a whirlwind and major force in this film that all the others fade into the background but Michael Pitt(lately of ""Dawson's Creek"") has the appropriate boy toy look and makes a good impression as Hedwig's protege, ""Gnosis.""",996364800,,841,4.726027397260274
1649575,5,B00005QW5X,"Even if ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" was only a witty and brilliant 'anatomically incorrect' pastiche of Bowiesque glam-rock and Hagenesque teutonic punk--with the most electrifying musical performance since Tina Turner's Acid Queen cameo in the otherwise forgettable ""Tommy""--it would be an exceptional achievement. But this film is so much more. Hedwig herself defiantly spans the divide between East and West, male and female, innocence and experience, comedy and tragedy, creation and destruction. And when she sings, she's like a force of nature. The songs are outstanding, John Cameron Mitchell is captivating, and an extrememly talented cast of actors and musicians--including Miriam Shor and Andrea Martin--provide tremendous support. With its wild combination of scathing social commentary and moving personal struggle, ""Hedwig"" is a triumph on every level, and is sure to be among the very best films of the year.",996364800,5,922,5.5928571428571425
1649576,5,B00005QW5X,"Forget Moulin Rouge: Mitchell grabs the American movie musical by its lapels and yanks it phoenix-like from the ash heap in his brilliant cinematic debut! Think the Von Trapp Family Singers meet Iggy Pop and the Stooges. Think the Velvet Underground and Nico as presented by Rogers and Hammerstein. Subversive, hilarious, smart, gorgeous - this summer's first American must-see!",996105600,3,378,5.423728813559322
1649577,5,B00005QW5X,"I Saw the movie twice in just a few weeks (SF Intl Film Fest and SF GLB&T Film Fest) it was so wonderful.  Both showings were blessed with Mitchell presenting the film and then a short Q&A session after.  It's a great and fun musical (lines are spoken, but songs are performed throughout).  Mitchell plays Hedwig, a kind of somber, witty, and controlling kind of gay boy mixed up into a sex-change glam rocker.  The dialogue is *hilarious* (as drag demands, but without the often common (and, dare I say, trite) Super Bitchiness) -- you just keep cracking up.  There's also this whole wonderful story of the Origin of Love, four-legged creatures split by the Gods, primarily told very creatively through cartoon sequences.  But Hedwig seems so real and full of life throughout -- with hope, sadness, anger, betrayal, and love.  The song lyrics are also hysterical.  It's a great creative indie film.  If you like camp, rock, gender, and queer all rolled into one (and shouldn't you, after all ;-) then this is the Film for you!",993513600,14,1027,4.724719101123595
1649578,5,B00005QW5X,"I just got to see this film as part of a film festival, prior to its national release, and it is fantastic!  Like both ""Rocky Horror"" and ""Tommy,"" it is filled with over-the-top excess, great original rock songs, and interesting characters--esp. Hedwig/Handel her/himself.  We learn about Hedwig, a refugee from the former East Berlin, via a series of flashbacks, often during performances of Hedwig's ""internationally unknown"" band, The Angry Inch, as it continues its national tour of low-rent seafood restaurants, always near where famous rock star Tommy Gnosis is playing (but don't say she is stalking him, even if he did steal all her songs and broke her heart).  The ending is unexpected yet satisfying, as Hedwig comes to understand the origin of love.  Filled with witty dialogue, biting song lyrics (including new songs just for the film), and unique visual imagery, ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is a must-see tour-de-force that already has a cult following (thanks to the success of the off-Broadway show and the success of the film at Sundance).  I can't wait to get the soundtrack, and eventually the video/DVD!",993427200,9,1123,5.081521739130435
1649579,5,B00005QW5X,"Hey Guys,  See this ! I was able to see its premiere at berlin film festival in February, and great it was ! The little boy who had to grow up in eastern berlin (his mother having th coolest american accent a german mother can have), had to play in the stove and was finally transformed into an almost-woman turns out to become the wildest popstar ever...this movie, based on the musical being on stage for years now (and being written by the director and main actor of this film) does not at all have to hide beside cult items like the ""rocky horror picture show"" or ""priscilla, queen of the desert"" - this film is cult even before it started ! Great (and surprisingly good and rocky!) music, ultimate show pieces (or however you might call it) and a totally cool story do its part, but the actors make it really big - so, go, watch ist and have a 90 minute laugh!

1649709,3,B00005QW5X,"I rented this film to keep up with the podcasat Moving On. I was disappointed the person who chose this film was not available to give her reasons for choosing it at the time of recording. I had never heard of it before. After seeing it, I can't say I would have ever rented this from a dvd store when it was first available for home video rental. It's a transgender film. But the main character Hedwig is so hard to understand and like. It's a film that feels more about rebellion without responsibility then even remotely having anything to do with acceptance. It most certainly is not Transparent. There is some interesting cinematography that makes this film stand out from others.

Actors I took notice throughout the film. Her character was bad as Hedwig's mother. But I was happy to see Alberta Watson from La Femme Nikita was in it. I was however saddened to remember she past away from cancer last year. I was also surprised to see a young Michael Pitt from Boardwalk Empire was in the film. And Andrea Martin never seems to age as can be compared to her in 2001 vs 2016.

I don't have regrets seeing the film. But I can't say I'll be in a hurry to see it again any time soon.

1649720,5,B00005QW5X,"John Cameron Mitchell created a classic every man/woman story about looking for oneself...and finding it. I have seen this compared to Rocky Horror Picture Show and, while there are some superficial similarities, this film goes so much deeper than that and is still wickedly humorous. I can see how some people might be turned off by a movie where the lead character is talked into a sex change surgery that he doesn't want (or need) and is ultimately ruined. But this is a story about a journey. The surgery and abandonment are just the catalyst to get the ball rolling. And what a funny, tender, outrageous journey it is. The soundtrack is wonderful, too. Highly recommended...unless you really, really just don't like rock and roll music.",1474243200,,741,4.888888888888889

John Cameron Mitchell is spectacular, playing the part of Hedwig, aka Hansel, he captured my attention and made me fall in love. Some of my favorite songs are from this movie, Stephen Trask doing an excellent job with the music and lyrics. Hedwig gives a truly stunning representation of the struggle a person faces when searching for their own happiness while dealing with outside forces. You will laugh and cry with Hedwig. I highly recommend everyone give Hedwig a try.",1439164800,,592,4.757281553398058

Maybe the visual elements & scenes played out in the movie are more of a distraction than an explanation or embellishment.

What's super great about the DVD, is that you can watch only the musical number, which is something I do while cleaning the house, and
it gives me a good motivation to move around.
The extra material on the DVD is priceless, as it had an almost feature about how Hedwig was born off-Broadway in a NYC play, by John Cameron Mitchell. The film is amazing and shows a lot of exclusive footage of behind the scenes.

1650444,2,B00005QW5X,"If you aren't into ""artsy"" films, here meaning a nonlinear story, random monologues, weird shots and very little exposition, this movie is not for you.  Going by that it's not for me either, but I was persuaded to watch it by the promise of good music and in that area, at least, I suppose it delivers.  The songs in H&TAI have to convey a lot of the story as well as being properly ""deep"" and what I'd normally call pretentious, but whoever wrote them is a good lyricist and they're better crafted than any other aspect of the movie.  The music, too, is well-written to the point that none of it would sound out of place on the radio (with different words, sometimes, perhaps).  There's not really that many songs total, however.

Regarding the movie as a whole, I'm ambivalent.  Hedwig's story is interesting, but my gosh are aspects of it creepy.  To be clear, it's not really the characters themselves who weird me out; rather, it's the typical art movie stuff they get up to.  Being gay (or transexual?) and having a botched operation?  Not creepy.  Lying in ruins and walking through streets naked, seducing a younger man with candy, and masturbating the teenage brother of a child you're babysitting?  All creepy as hell.  Nobody says or does anything natural seeming, cause that wouldn't be creative enough I guess.

I think I could say good things about the main character's acting, if I saw more evidence of it.  There's very little non-monolouging dialogue, but the actor conveys some pretty honest seeming emotions (mostly crippling depression).  The same goes for some of the others as well.  The movie as a whole has a sort of flat tone, even when people are yelling or playing fairly hard-rocking songs.  I think it's an attempt at sophistication through extreme stylization.  You've got to read a lot into every small action to actually get a story out of this series of musical numbers and anecdotes.  Alternatively you can just look at the pretty pictures.

I don't care about the movie's philosophy on love, truth and the power of rock or whatever it's trying to say.  I wanted to get to know Hedwig, but I don't feel like the movie shows us enough of her to let that happen.  I also wanted to like Hedwig and I kind of hated her (him, by the end?).  Like many people, I entirely lost the thread of the last few scenes.  Dunno if they even happened; they could have been a dream sequence.  Overall I don't find the movie very memorable, but I do have some suggestions as to who might like to watch it.  Basically, if you got all the way through Velvet Goldmine you should enjoy Hedwig just fine.  I... actually can't think of another audience who would appreciate it.  It's rated highly on Amazon, though, so don't mind me if you like and give it a shot.",1365292800,4,2773,4.58130081300813

Like a caped crusader wrapped up in the American Flag, she is her own hero. She wears her wigs and makeup like a 1980's rock star who knows what it means to have to fight to make her voice heard. Hedwig capitulates the very essence of rock and roll into the less frequented venues for such finery with as much tranny flair as humanly possible.

Hedwig's one goal is to be a star and on her journey she creates one through Tommy Gnosis. The sweet seeming Christian boy who steals her heart and her songs leaves her performing in random restaurants where the majority of customers look bored or even disgusted by her presence. For them, Hedwig is someone they endure. They can't relate to the pain six inches forward and five inches back creates in a person.

1650476,5,B00005QW5X,"...You are going to love ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"". It is delightful, funny and at time poignant with a fantastic musical score wrapped around it. Originally an off broadway play created by and starred John Cameron Mitchell who then made into a movie. It is about a transsexual rock and roll singer from East Berlin who comes to the United States to find her fame and fortune. Along the way she meets a young man that she helps develope into a big time rock singer who then leaves her stealing her songs and taking credit for them in the process. The movie has hilarious moments along side touching moments as well as Hedwig as a new woman in a new country tries to understand her place in the world. It is a feeling that all of us, not just transgendered individuals, have felt at some point in out lives. That is where I think ""Hedwig"" is a better movie then ""Rocky Horror"". Not that I don't like ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" because I definately do. ""Rocky Horror"" rates as one of the greatest cult movies of all time. But ""Hedwig"" deals with emotions and situations that can bring the movie to a more personal experience for the viewer again whether the viewer is transgendered or not.

The acting in the film is first rate as well as the directing. The storytelling is clever as well with the use of animation at various points to help tell the story. Throw in the fact that the soundtrack is amazing with some kick@$$ songs just helps to make the experience of watching ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" all the more enjoyable to watch. In fact if you find in watching ""Hedwig"" that you love the music, as well as the movie, as much as I do then you need to get yourself the soundtrack album. While in the movie you get just snippets of some of the songs from the film, the soundtrack album plays all the songs in their entirerty. That is important since the songs themselves also play an important part in helping to tell the story.

1650500,5,B00005QW5X,"It's pretty difficult to explain. Not that the movie is incredibly deep and full of allusions. It's because our main protagonist is unlike any before, with a slight nod towards Rocky Horror.

Meet Hedwig. After a botched surgery that was intended to be a ticket out of Berlin, he finds himself on a razor's edge of insanity and angst. Lots of angst. And he wrote a song for each of those times. Looking into the Abyss and something is seen. But even then, he can't crawl out from the infinite mouth-like cave. Anyway, he meets a guy and there is chemistry. They grow into an awkward relationship. This is seen as a break-up when his main squeeze Tommy Spect up and steals all of Hedwing's music and adopted a moniker Tommy Gnosis. Tommy gets all the fame while Hedwig mostly gets on stage in sleazy bar and underwhelming concerts with a single fan in attendance. The whole movie hinges on Hedwig and Tommy, and once the film reaches the climax I was left with a breath of fresh air; too few movies create something as solid and insightful.

Extra Features - commentaries, deleted scenes... all the normal fare. The Whether You Like it or Not documentary is a really good feature that shows the evolution of the Hedwig phenomena.

Soundtrack - who cares? The only thing you should expect from the sound track is the songs. This is a musical, and after every emotional beat, someone (usually Hedwig) would burst into song... not just songs, these are movements of truth trying to escape from the B.S. and banality of the world. But it does have a 5.1 and DTS.

Hedwig get's into your head and it's a lot to take in, being hilarious at one time and three seconds later a solid fog of emotional doom looms over the cast.

It's a flip of the coin. You'll either love it, or you're gonna hate it.  The film itself is a lot of fun. The music is surreal. Watch it. Then send me a message, let me know what your feelings are for the 'Origin of Love'. By the time that song is done, you'll know whether or not you'll enjoy the rest of the film.",1321228800,,2034,4.410666666666667

Many years later I just had a craving for it again, and so I went on a journey to find it on DVD and what do you know, AMAZON had it. I have watched it several times since the date of purchase and recommend it to anyone who just loves multiple art media in one. It is a riveting tale of a Transsexual Germinate named ""Hedwig"" and her struggle to find love and her place in the universe. Beautifully directed by John Cameron Mitchell, full of songs that are guaranteed to make you laugh and cry.

1650529,5,B00005QW5X,"John Cameron Mitchell's ""baby"", ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"", may be low-budget, but its depth of content makes it a masterpiece. Mitchell's inspiration is clearly Plato's ""The Symposium"", a group of speeches by ancient Greeks who met at a banquet to ""praise Eros"". The speeches present different views on the concepts of love and soulmates, and ""Hedwig"" uses those philosophical examinations as she takes her own journey to find ""completion"". Stephen Trask's soudtrack perfectly reflects the sentiments presented in ""Symposium"" but in a quirky, modern way. The centerpiece of ""Symposium"", Aristophanes creation story, in which he posits that we began as '3 sexes' rather than 2  who were fused together (male/male, female/female, male/female), then cut in half by Zeus' lightening bolt and left to wander around the Earth looking for our ""other half"", is reflected in the song ""Origin of Love"", which is the centerpiece of the film. In the movie, Hedwig (born Hansel), has been struggling ""her"" whole life; her life changes when she undergoes a botched sex change operation in order to move to America with a G.I. When he leaves, Hedwig is again lost, and she eventually finds her way to Tommy Gnosis, with whom she enters a paiderastic relationship: she gives him knowledge, he gives her affection. Since Hedwig can't literally give birth, her babies are her songs; she prides herself on her music. After teaching Tommy her songs, he ""runs off with the good stuff"", and she's left with nothing. Hedwig thinks she has found her soul mate in Tommy, but he turns out to be more ""bad"" than ""beautiful"". In the end, she must learn that she doesn't need ""another half"" to be complete; she is whole all along. A major symbol in the film is the Berlin Wall; Hedwig's wall is her gender identity, which she must ""tear down"" in order to ""be free"". The images are at first shocking, but once you get past the make-up and wig, what is left is a self-examination so vulnerable, so pure, and so beautiful...",1267920000,,1994,4.882005899705015

We follow Hedwigs life story filled with disappointments, heartache, confusion, but never loss of spirit.  He/she trudges through life holding his/her head up high using his/her biggest talent- music.
The imagery in this movie is awesome, I do not think I will ever forget seeing Hedwig as a little boy honing his singing craft with his head in the oven, as tomatoes are being thrown at him, or lying naked on the ruins of a fallen church, with gummy bears strewn around him.
The music in this movie is also awesome!!  A little campy and cheesy, but glam rock has never been so soulful.  Pay particular attention to the crown jewel of the soundtrack ""The Origin of Love"" which is an emotional, heartfelt, rocking song about Plato's Symposium on how we were once separated from our other half, and spend our lives looking for them, to find true love.

You will fall in love with Hedwig!!",1260144000,,1048,4.736263736263736
1650533,5,B00005QW5X,"One of my favorite pictures of all time pictures.  The story, though somewhat werid at first, is campy and cultish.  However, it has enough ""body"" to make one think of how life throws events at us that seem to make no sense at first.  As we progress throuh time, if we are aware, we realize the events all come together to create what we refer to as ""our lives"".  The search for friendship, love and happiness often falls on ""the rocks"" no matter how hard we strive to hold onto them. Hedwig's case in point.  All we can do is ""keep pulling out the wig, wearing it for a while and then putting it back on the shelf"".
The song, ""Origin of Love"" is one of the most beautiful, thought provoking songs ever written.  Truly written from a perspective of love I had never considered.  Probably, one of my favoritesongs ever.
If you like the off beat, silly, touching, funny, depressing and ""enjoy life today"" genre of flicks, this is a must see and own movie.  Enjoy.",1252886400,6,961,4.389830508474576

I am glad I gave this film a chance. It changed my life. I think it is the best movie I've ever watched. The acting is superb, the songs are fantastic, the storyline is brilliant, the casting cannot be better. Since I bought it I must have watched it 20 times. Several times I invited friends and neighbors and everyone loved it. It is a true 21st century masterpiece, and like every masterpiece everytime you watch it (or look or listen) you discover deeper meaning, brilliant details, and overall genius. The movie is a portrait of an artist, and nothing else should be said before watching it. After watching it, I've decided to read Plato's Symposium and Isherwood's The Berlin Novels, two books that are related to the movie. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this film.",1252454400,,921,4.691358024691358
1650536,5,B00005QW5X,"People who know me will look at the title I gave this review--and if they didn't already think so--say, ""Oh my, now the poor ol' thing's finally lost it...""

I can't help it, I really liked this movie. It had all the earmarks of potential disaster for me. I'm not real found of female impersonation, particularly in a sustained artistic form such as a film. Then there are the inevitable comparisons between HEDWIG and other similiar genre like ROCKY HORROR SHOE, PRISCILA OF THE DESERT, etc. I enjoy comedy, and I also enjoy substance. The world of female impersonation/drag queens can be extraordinarily superficial, filled with an angst that can be met with a world weary response like ""So, what?""

Let me start with the nuts & bolts, like John Cameron Mitchell's form of gender bending & his musical lyrics & routines. He conveys a great depth to Hedwig without being mired in pathos or mere impersonation. Visually his chracter(s) are stunningly realistic (given the unreality of the world in which s/he lives.) The songs are fantastic, somewhere like a cross between T-Rex & Talking Heads. Some of the animation interjected reminded me of Bjork music videos. Not a great lover of musicals, I found myself actually looking forward to the next number.

Pertaining to the Gnostic element, a major theme in the film, it involves Hedwig's relationship with a boy who talks like a Jesus freak, but there is a much deeper level to his spiritual view--and it interacts with Hedwig's views on The Origin of Love. Either intentionally or not, it is almost a classic Gnostic interpretation of The Garden of Eden story of The Fall of Man. The fact that Hedwig invents the name of Tommy Gnostic for her lover may indicate that the artist knew exactly what s/he was doing when it came to the Gnostic theme.

I say ""artist"" because this film is the creation of a great artist in association with other obviously great artists.

It's is EXTREMELY entertaining too.",1247356800,,1954,4.803571428571429

The story isn't in the movie, it is in the music; the lyrics tell the story of Hedgewig and express her loss, her anger, everything about her.  The end is kind of abrupt, but if the viewer sits and thinks for a minute it is deep and touching.  I can't wait to recieve my copy.
I don't dicredit those who saw the movie as bizaar, it could be seen as a little OTT, but it all fits Hedgewig and her life...and if you look at the artists Hedgewig styles her music after, the visuals fit into the picture very well...glam-punk it's all there.  I challenge anyone who didn't like it from the first showing to sit down and look at it again, thinking about the different elements of the film and the story and how they all tie together to make this piece of art.

If you are one for indie, documentary-like films then you should see this! The music is amazing, and 'midnight radio' is now a top fav of mine. I think this movie is loved by a select crowd, but still should been seen by everyone.
However I don't think I'd watch this with my parents, lol. Some parts of the movie are odd, nothing wrong with the scenes...just culturally odd. :/

Though Pitt does a fine job, it was John Cameron Mitchell that kept me glued to the screen.  The songs were not only entertaining, but down right electrifying.

He'd performed the role many times, but there's a freshness of the futilty of poor Hedwig that can't be denied. As a stage effort, it was slow to gain momentum, and when it was finally established, no one thought it could be done by anyone else. Well, many did, including Ally Sheedy and Sarah Bernhard, and this is all brought out in the extras on the DVD. Mr. Mitchell is in command of this enigmatic, complex character, and one can only sit back in awe of the presentation.

Decent, if thoroughly off-the-wall, for the majority of its running length, ""Hedwig"" flies off the rails in a disappointing conclusion that leaves the viewer with the impression that the filmmakers didn't know where to take their eccentric German transsexual wannabe rocker.",1229472000,,292,5.636363636363637
1650591,5,B00005QW5X,"I have probably a dozen different reviews of this movie in various stages of completion on my computer. The problem is that I keep trying to say everything I want to say about it, and there just isn't enough time or space in this world for it all.

I saw Hedwig live many times at the Jane Street Theatre in NYC. I loved her so much there that I refused to see the movie for many years. Not until after I'd seen Shortbus on DVD in the summer of 2008 did I go back and watch Hedwig, to see if it could possibly be as bad as Shortbus was. Not only was it not, it was so GOOD that it made Shortbus even more inexplicable.

I'm not going to go into all the details of why I love Hedwig so much. Stephen Trask's songs are just marvelous, as they always were, and the added movie score is great; John Cameron Mitchell and Michael Pitt are wonderful in the two lead roles (Mitchell's crazed Hedwig dancing and his extreme closeups singing straight into the camera get to me especially; Pitt is perfect as Tommy and does the best lip-syncing ever); and I can't even begin to say what an unbelievably brilliant job Mitchell has done in bringing Hedwig to the screen.

I never imagined I'd say this, but the movie is BETTER than the live show. It's more accessible, human, touching, moving, beautiful, and on and on and on. I watch it over and over, and it gets richer and more fun and more rewarding every time. I'm very grateful to Mitchell, Trask and everybody else involved for creating Hedwig, and then for making her available anywhere, everywhere, forever.

1650620,4,B00005QW5X,"I won't repeat the summaries of this film -- I only want to say it is much more than a cult film but is more exciting and intriguing and fun and sad than most films out there.  Unfortunately even New Line decided to market this as a niche product -- comparing it to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  Without knocking that film, which is a phenomenon of its own, Hedwig is in a different league.  While the style of Hedwig's band owes a lot to camp and to glam rock the film itself is never campy.  It has the music and power and vision of some of the great musical celebrations like The Wall and The Commitments, but has a more intimate feel than either of those.  It is, in style, closer to a documentary, and after watching this you will swear that Hedwig is not merely an invention of the actor and director John Cameron Mitchell but has a life of his own.

Apart from enjoying the film quite a bit, I was also quite happy when I noticed that the song ""The Origin of Love"" is a retelling of the story Aristophanes tells in one of the most exciting of ancient books, Plato's Symposium -- of how in the beginning we were created as a unity of two and the gods saw that the contentment this generated made us too powerful and divided us, so that love is the longing for our other half.",1205280000,4,1283,4.195121951219512
1650621,5,B00005QW5X,"Sing along, now:  My sex change operation got botched; my guardian angel fell asleep on the watch; now all I got is a Barbie doll crotch; I've got an angry inch!

And there you have it.  Some of the wittiest, most outrageously delicious lines fall from the lips of Hedwig, the loveliest Eastern Berlin glam-Bloc girly boy to ever fall in love with an American soldier, only to become the angriest inch in the Junction City, Kansas trailer park.  Abandoned by hir new husband, Hedwig becomes a sensation in hir own mind, touring local restaurants with hir band comprised of Korean Army wives.  Along the way Hedwig meets and befriends a young Christian boy.  Hedwig falls in love.  The boy, Tommy Gnosis, steals all of hir songs and becomes a sellout rockstar.

If that thread of the story wasn't sad, humorous and compelling enough on its own, the animated interweaving of Aristophanes' speech in Plato's Symposium is beautifully spun.  It is that smooth rendering against the garish and, angry world of Hedwig that the real story of transformation emerges.  Resting solely on the fluid dynamic of sexuality, it's easy to go into this film with that in focus as the prevailing theme.  Hedwig's effort to recreate hir desired body shape results in a state of being that requires perhaps even more self-acceptance than the original did.  However, in hir relationship with Tommy the question of acceptance becomes one of a more intangible nature:  can one live without one's soul complement?  If not can one make the changes in oneself in order to live with one's soul complement?

So we wrapped our arms around each other,
Trying to shove ourselves back together.
We were making love,
Making love.
It was a cold dark evening,
Such a long time ago,
When by the mighty hand of Jove,
It was the sad story
How we became
Lonely two-legged creatures,
It's the story of
The origin of love.
That's the origin of love.",1201219200,,1907,4.753799392097265

All of the songs are ""sing-along"" worthy and delivered in the classic glam rock style.  This is a sad story of a gay young man, victim of a botched sex change operation, desperately searching for someone to love him for who he is, rather than who he aspires to be.

1650649,4,B00005QW5X,"Hedwig Robinson (John Cameron Mitchell) is a rocker. And she's got The Angry Inch beside her (and in her pants). As a young man, Hansel/Hedwig lived in East Berlin, right before The Wall came tumbling down. His sexual identity was always in question and when a cute, black, American soldier gives him a way out of the Eastern Bloc, Hedwig jumps on him (literally and figuratively). But he can't get to the other side of The Wall as a man, so an operation takes place to remove his vital functions below the waist ...if you get my meaning. Needless to say (if you pay attention to the title of the film), the surgery gets botched and leaves Hedwig with his ""Angry Inch.""

The anger is twofold. First is the failed operation; second is Hedwig's fury over stolen musical material by someone named Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt). Tommy is a rock-n-roll sensation, but it's all because of what Hedwig taught him in his early days. So Hedwig, in true b! tchy fashion, follows Tommy's rock tour around the world. But instead of playing in theaters and high end places, Hedwig and his Angry Inch band play at lowbrow restaurants, often to the dismay of its patrons who've simply come in to eat.

Hedwig's decline into obscurity is well played by director/actor John Cameron Mitchell. The musical soundtrack is very well done and the catchy tunes will have most movie watchers tapping their toes along to the rockin' beats. That he also remains angry at some of his band members is quite funny, actually holding them hostage by keeping their passports hidden away.

Revenge is the meal of the day as Hedwig finally meets up with Tommy again, eventually leading to Tommy's career demise and launching Hedwig into the spotlight. But is this what Hedwig really wanted? Not realizing the sacrifices she'd have to make, Hedwig decides to re-open her/his closet and show the world his/her true identity. He also sets free one of his band members who turns out to be a woman masquerading as a man, too.

Those willing to watch a film without sitting in judgement of the material will most likely eat this story up. It's quite funny, well acted, and has a rippingly good soundtrack.

1650700,5,B00005QW5X,"I found that I liked everything about this film; the plot/story line, the acting, the musical score, the whole package.

The story of a young East German boy, reared by an unbalanced mother, seduced by a handsome African American soldier, and the victim of a botched sex change operation, is compelling and certainly confronts the issue of how we deal with adversity and reach some sense of inner peace with all those that have transgressed against us and with those whom we have transgressed upon.  The sly manner in which Platonic philosophy is weaved into the story was great. Plato's theories of gender differentiation is integrated into a rock song with cartoons!  Hedwig was dealt a bad hand, over and over, from his/her abandonment in a Midwest trailer park by her African American Sugar Daddy to the theft of her music by a young rocker for whom she once baby-sat. Yet it is reconciliation with the movement of life's ups and downs that is the real point of the story. Hedwig has been abandoned so many times that his/her radar is out for any disloyalty in her band - an obsession that eventually drives them away for a while. Yet, once Hedwig is told by Tommy Gnosis, the young rock star, that he acknowledges (sings) her major contribution to his success, she is able to allow her lead guitarist to move into the spotlight of a transgender rock star.

The acting in this film is super but John Cameron Mitchell is totally over the top. His acting is superb by any measure. His comedic timing is fantastic - delivering wonderful lines with just the right amount of sarcasm and nihilism. Tommy asks: Have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior? to which Hedwig calmly states: No but I love his work.  Mitchell's musical performances were as high powered as the dramatic acting. A rock musical is not the easiest idiom to control and master, yet Mitchell excelled.

Stephen Trask's musical score was exceptional. Like an opera, the score must fluctuate between the grand and the intimate, which is exactly what the score from this DVD offers.

1650752,4,B00005QW5X,"I don't know what's more incredible, that rock musicals keep getting better or that the best rock musicals focus on sexual ambiguity.

""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" outshines it's processor ""Rocky Horror"" in a number of arenas, it's better acted, the music is stronger, and the plot is far from campy. Well, it's a little campy but it's also sad and somewhat tragic, making this a very grown up rock opera.

John Cameron Mitchell plays Hedwig (formally Hansel) Robinson, a young German man who escapes Berlin with the help of an American serviceman. The two are lovers and Hansel must become Hedwig if he is to make it past the U.S. inspectors. So an operation is had, but the results are less than satisfying. Hedwig makes it to America, but there's still an inch of Hansel left. Hedwig is eventually abandoned by his/her lover. He/She experiments with music and soon mentors future rock star Tommy Gnosis. The movie starts with Hedwig far from being a ""has been"". Hedwig is a ""never was"" and is only able to score gigs at  roadside Holiday Inns. All the while Hedwig's discipline, Tommy Gnosis, is a mega star, making millions off the very songs Hegwig wrote.

We learn about Hedwig's life through the movie's songs and through effective flashbacks. There is much pain in Hedwig's life and the result turn him/her into a bitter bitch who only seems to find motivation in bringing everyone else around him/her crashing down. The end of the movie provides a sort of showdown between Hedwig and Gnosis. Hedwig gets his/her chance at fame but more importantly, Hedwig gets  a shot at enlightenment. Is he Hedwig? Is he Hansel? Is he Gnosis? Or is he something else...something he's been looking for since before he was anything. So, yes, the ending is complicated but the real meat to this movie is the journey Hedwig takes.",1135209600,,1820,4.765079365079365
1650753,5,B00005QW5X,"A popular off-Broadway cult hit in the late 90s, a motion picture version of John Cameron Mitchell's ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" finally saw a release in 2001. Only four years since it was released as of this writing, the film has already achieved legendary status. Along with ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" (1975) ""Tommy"" (1975) and the newcomer ""Velvet Goldmine"" (1998), ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is regarded as a rock n' roll movie classic.

Why has ""Hedwig"" achieved such adoration as well as critical acclaim? What is it, exactly; do people see in this movie? What's the appeal? Many other reviewers and sources have detailed descriptions of the plot, so I won't go into a detailed synopsis. Instead, I will state why I personally love this movie.

""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" has been labeled ""gay camp,"" or otherwise an empowerment of gay culture and identity. While this is true, ""Hedwig"" is much more than that. ""Hedwig"" transcends being a gay cult film. While it is a film that celebrates diversity and sexuality, it mostly celebrates being true to yourself, of accepting yourself for who you are. Hedwig (Mitchell) uses what she ""has to work with,"" just like everyone. No matter whom you are or what your sexuality is, there is a little bit of Hedwig in everybody.

A major theme of ""Hedwig"" that so many can relate to is unrequited love. She spends her whole life, every waking moment searching for her ""other half."" She thinks it may be Tommy, or maybe Yitzhak?

The way in which the movie plays out is pure enchantment. The colorful cinematography, illustrations, musical score, anecdotes, and songs are a delight to all senses. From the gummy bear scene, to the food fight, to the singing in the oven, to the band of Korean housewives, to the grand finale, every scene is mesmerizing.

As we witness Hedwig's formative years, to her failed marriage, to her preoccupation and obsession with Tommy Gnosis, we are taken on a journey. It is a ride through anticipation, melancholy, anger, joy, and ultimately self-discovery.

""Hedwig"" is a film that can be enjoyed on many levels. It can be enjoyed as camp and pure entertainment, or can be analyzed for deeper meaning. That makes it a film worth owning that can be seen again and again. Every time I watch this movie I pick up something new, or rethink a particular scene or line. This movie will make you laugh, make you sing, and make you think.

Stephan Trask's songs are absolutely incredible. The songs in this film are as good as any of the bands they were inspired from (Lou Reed, David Bowie, Iggy Pop). As soon as I saw this film I had to buy the soundtrack and it remains a favorite of mine.

The supporting cast is great. Miriam Shor gives an outstanding performance as Hedwig's lover Yitzhak, Andrea Martin as the dedicated agent, Ben Mayor-Goodman as a young Hedwig, and Michael Pitt as the bewildered Tommy.

The DVD has a lot of cool extras that should please fans of the film. This includes a documentary that explains the orgins of the movie in detail, deleted scenes and cast bios.",1130371200,13,3065,4.714018691588785

So let me say one more thing: This movie is not for everyone.

But it was for me.

I really, really love this movie. Hedwig starts out in the beginning being a character that is almost too big for life, someone that you can believe exists but that you don't believe has a lot of depth to them. You start imagining that (s)he is one more glam-queen failed rock-star stereotype that has found her/his way into a movie. That's what threw me towards not liking this movie.

But it's simply not true, not even vaguely. As the movie progresses, you start to see the subtle shades that this character possesses; you see the tragedies that have bounced this character through his/her life, see the triumphs that (s)he almost touched, you see the things that are important and that make her/him who (s)he is....and you begin to realize that Hedwig might be, just might be...beautiful.

That's right. That's the conclusion I came to at the end of the movie, that despite all the strange and bad things that had beaten this character through his/her life, that at the end of the day the only thing that Hedwig really wanted was to be loved for who (s)he really is on the inside. That idea is what sets this movie ten leagues above other movies like it; it's an almost phantom-of-the-opera-ish idea, hiding behind the make-up and lights just to try and reach out to people who will never understand.

There is also the idea of this being a sort of love story. It's not a boy-girl love story by any means but more of a soul-mate kind. Where is the other half that completes each of us? Who is it? What energy type is it? Masculine? Feminine? This movie takes that idea and blurs the edges, making us guess at it until the final scenes in the movie. It comes across in such a way as to make anyone think about the idea (no matter what their personal ideas on gender roles might be). It's presented in a very positive fashion.

If you're going to watch this movie, let me at least point out the one thing that ought to be obvious (but should still be pointed out): Listen to the lyrics!!!! The songs are subtle (and great!) and help move the story along in a way that simple dialogue could never do. The anger and sadness that is built into them is inspiring to behold. This is what a modern musical should look like.

The only thing I didn't like (and is worth noting) would be some of the sets. I didn't like the fold-down trailer that acted as a sort of stage for one of the movie's songs. I didn't like how tight the shots were when the boy (Gnosis) goes to watch Hedwig perform with his Asian back-up band (which was funny). Some of those things got on my nerves...but they are tiny, insignificant details that should never, ever keep you from seeing this movie.

Bottom line: If you don't have inhibitions and want to enjoy a well-told tale with a lot of depth to it, this is a great movie!",1125273600,17,3132,4.376936316695353

1650790,4,B00005QW5X,"A very good movie from an even better stage show. Challenges all your hetero perceptions of what gender is, and what's attractive. Hedwig is not initially painted as a very likable character, although you might sympathize with her circumstances. But by the end, you grow to like and admire her, and even cheer for her courage. And  oddly enough, she becomes a more attractive woman as the movie progresses. Interesting, stylish direction from star/writer John Cameron Mitchell and brilliant 80s era songs from Stephen Trask, which echo Bowie and Iggy closely. This one bears repeated viewings, as the many depths and convolutions in the story and lyrics emerge slowly.

Now I go to my friends house and do a double header of Rocky horror and Hedwig to sing along to.

1650794,5,B00005QW5X,"A brilliant story about love, the struggle for recognition as an artist, rock and roll and isolation.

It's also about a transsexual but that is almost incidental.

The music borrows from punk and glam rock but is completely original and hard driving and is accompanied by equally hard driving images and animation.

For those of you who have not see the movie I don't want to give too much away.

Hedwig Robinson heads a band called the Angry Inch. She/he was born as Hansel in drab East Germany and leaves thanks to his/her marriage to an American army officer and a sex change operation. In America she meets a young man named Tommy who she falls in love with. She grooms him as a rock star. But when Tommy learns of Hedwig's anatomical anomaly he leaves her, steals the songs she wrote and becomes a superstar. Through the movie Hedwig stalks Tommy as she and her band playing in a third rate dives of the ""Bildgewater"" chain in every city Tommy is playing to sold out crowds in stadiums.

In between the rock and roll is a lot of philosophy. Sadness and humor are played side by side.

As far as the humorous side of this movie sometimes it is sidesplittingly funny.

Hedwig's self deprecating lines are brilliant.

The movie is both outrageous and sympathetic to the human condition (not just for transsexuals).

This is a tour de force by John Cameron Mitchell wrote directed and stars in the lead role.

This is not just a cult movie! As far as I am concerned it blows the socks off of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"".

A really treat to the eyes, ears and mind.

Truly a d*mn joy!

I ended up watching it a second time, a third, a fourth, and with each time I watched it I began to like it more and more. I'm not sure why this is, but it's a movie with songs and charactars that really grow on you. After a while you'll start singing the songs and quoting the movie.",1114473600,,581,4.243243243243243

Hedwig is a girl with a serious past and a wonderful, if sometimes misguided, outlook on the future. Her story is funny, heart rending, and completely entertaining. Though few of us have probably ever been in Hedwig's (fabulous) shoes, I'm sure that everyone single one of us can identify with how this more-than-woman feels!

I love musicals, and this is my favorite of them all. If you liked ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", or even tolerated sitting through all of ""Velvet Goldmine,"" then you will definately like this Rock Opera gone totally awry.",1112054400,,717,4.59375
1650848,5,B00005QW5X,"The Rocky Horror comparison is easy, I guess. Why? Well, it's a rock musical with transvestites in it, right? But it's much more than that. If you're a Rocky fan, and you watch Hedwig because you heard they're alike, expecting cult value, you'll probably be disappointed... even though Hedwig has more cult following than you'd expect, and in some places weekly screenings with costumes and audience participation a la Rocky are actually held. But Hedwig is much more than that. Aside from the truly great music (which I'll discuss in a minute) the story of Hedwig and the Angry Inch is a sad tale of surprising depth, encompassing loneliness, betrayal, sexual confusion and identity crises as well as a bit of simplistic but kindly treated Platonic philosophy, with a brilliant ending that leaves many question marks and is good for hours of debate and discussion.

Hedwig and the Angry Inch is certainly not, as some reviewers point out, a niche film to be enjoyed only by homosexuals - though I imagine you'd probably have some problems with it if you're particularly homophobic or conservative. As long as you're open-minded, Hedwig (meaning both the film and the character) has the power to appeal and to move everyone; I haven't seen the stage version - Many people say that other actors who played Hedwig were better than John Cameron Mitchell - but John is absolutely electrifying in this role, surprisingly appealing and charismatic, as well as recognizable (which is quite surprising when you're talking about a transvestite glam-rocker from East Germany), and he acts and sings with all his guts. The fact that he is also the writer and the director, I think, really shows and it's for the best; the film is very personal, and you can tell from his acting that the character is all his own. Miriam Shor and Michael Pitt are both amazing in the supporting roles.

Even if all of that doesn't work for you, the music is where the film really stands out, and it's also the biggest point of difference between it and Rocky. While Rocky was created and inspired by the glam rock scene, the music - with maybe a couple of exceptions, like the wonderful and biting 'Sweet Transvestite' - is the stuff of Broadway, or at least Off-Broadway. That's not putting it down; it was intentional. The music on the Rocky Horror Picture Show is for the most part musical parody, pop tunes of sarcasm and wonderful dark humor. The songs on Hedwig are much more serious business, and much more complex, too, and most of them sound like they might have been recorded by David Bowie at the very height of his career. The rockier, harder songs like 'Angry Inch', 'Exquisite Corpse' and the spectacular, show-stopping opener 'Tear Me Down' sound like Ziggy Stardust mixed with Iggy Pop and tossed twenty five years into the future, with heavenly power chords and thundering bass and drums; 'The Origin Of Love' is an amazingly beautiful epic rock ballad with gorgeous lyrics; 'Wig In A Box' is a spectacular pop song which is so catchy it would have made a mega-hit were it released in the 70s; and the closing song 'Midnight Radio' is so classic a power ballad that you'll find your hand immediately reaching for the lighter. The band is fantastic, they have a terrific sound and are all great musicians, but they let Mitchell have all the attention he deserves. By the way, the music used in the shooting is playback as is usually the case in such movies, but John's vocals were recorded live, and it shows in his very emotional and powerful performances that have the feel of a live concert. Also, each song - especially 'The Origin Of Love' and 'Wig In A Box' - is shot as a perfect video clip. The band members, though they are not actors, and hardly talk at all, all look great on film and are pretty funny guys, too.

In conclusion, let's just say it's a great film and get it over with. It's not a trash film, or a cult film, or a gay film. Just a great musical and a great film overall. I dare you not to run and buy the soundtrack after you watch it.",1110153600,4,4047,4.633704735376044
1650849,5,B00005QW5X,"When I first saw Hedwig, I was amazed. Not only is John Cameron Mitchell incredibly hot as a man or a woman. The movie is wonderful. It follows the story of Hedwig Robinson, a german woman born as a man called Hansel in cold war Berlin on the Eastern side of the Berlin wall. Feeling trapped and isolated, the rock and roll obsessed Hansel wishes to get out of Berlin hoping for a better life. He meets the american soldier Luther Robinson, who promises to marry Hansel and get him out of berlin. There is a catch; in order to be able to marry Luther, Hansel must undergo a full physical examination. In order to pass the examination, Hansel takes on the identity of a woman taking his mother's name (Hedwig Schmidt) and undergoes a sex-change operation, which unfortunatley goes awry and Hedwig is left with a small one-inch section of a penis. Sometime later, Luther and Hedwig have relocated to a small town in Kansas now, Luther has left her and now Hedwig must sit alone and watch as the Berlin wall comes down and is now alone. Hedwig gets a job babysitting for a local general while starting up a rock and roll band. She meets the teenager Tommy Speck (later known as Tommy Gnosis) and they develop a relationship while Hedwig sharpens Tommy's musical abilities. After discovering Hedwig's secret Tommy runs off, with all of Hedwigs music. Angry and hurt, Hedwig now travels around with her new band following Tommy. The music (written by Stephen Trask) tells Hedwigs story. John Cameron Mitchell sings the music with so much life you can feel what Hedwig feels. While there are many cross-dressing movies, this movie is simply beyond that. It examines the question of gender, what does it mean to be a woman? How can you define gender, biologically, socially? This is a great film, I suggest that anyone could watch this movie and enjoy it. You don't have to be transgendered to enjoy Hedwig, you just have to have an open mind.",1107388800,6,1936,4.630813953488372
1650850,5,B00005QW5X,"I was recommended this movie mainly due to my liking of Velvet Goldmine (the two are very different and should never be compared), and I must say that I was far from disappointed. It is a beautiful story about love, trying to find your ""other half"", trying to find yourself, & and finally having the courage to be yourself. This is not just a story that transexuals or sexually ""confused"" people will be able to relate to, contrary to what another individual said. The visuals are wonderful, as is the acting, and the soundtrack alone will make you fall in love with the film. The comic bits in the movie are hilarious as well.

The story is about a young man living in East Berlin pre-wall collapse. He falls in love with an American soldier, and desparate to leave his communist side of the country, decides to have a sex change so that he may marry the soldier and come to America. Unfortunately, the operation was botched and he was left with a ""one-inch mound of flesh."" Not too long after coming to America he is dumped in a trailer park in Kansas, his husband leaving him. He begins to write songs and perform them near and around the army base, catching the attention of a young Christian by the name of Tommy. The two become involved, but when the relationship turns sour Tommy steals Hedwig's songs, shooting to Christian Rock superstardom with the name Hedwig gave him: Tommy Gnosis. Hedwig follows Tommy around the country with his own band as Tommy tours, trying to gain the respect and recognition he deserves, not only from Tommy, but from the world. All of this is gradually told through Hedwig speaking to his various audiences around the country about he came to be the ""slip of a girly-boy barely standing before you"", with the occasional aid of child-like cartoons and drawings. The very end scene leaves something to be desired, within me at least, but it doesn't take much away from my love of the film.

This is truly a fantastic film that can be enjoyed by anyone though a slightly more open-mind to people of different sexualities and men in makeup is recommended, though will probably be obtained after viewing.

Actually, everything about this movie is excellent, except for Johnny Gnosis' voice but other than that the story is engaging, the music is incredible and the performances are so great.

I had the pleasure to meet him a few weeks ago and was so star-struck that I couldn't find myself to tell him how great I thought everything was.  I'd really recommend this movie to anyone and I am.

1650853,5,B00005QW5X,"A friend of mine where I work suggested this film to me. I had never heard of ""Hedwig"" before, though I had seen the box cover in numerous places, but never knew it.

All I can say is whoa. I mean, WHOA! As rumor has it, Stephen Trask (the lyricist and also an ""Inch"" guitar player) first met John Cameron Mitchell on a plane to LA, where the story arose that inspired the two to make a show.

Hedwig was originally a character developed at Don Hill's popular New York gay/rock nightclub scene, ""Squeezebox."" Mitchell, with the aid of friends like the famed Mistress Formika and Debbie Harry, turned what was described later as a ""very raw act"", into a smash hit.

The dance and song routine turned into a New Tork hotel theater based, off-Broadway rock musical, and, in 2002, was big enough to transform into the phenomenal motion-picture it is today!

In a nutshell, the plot of ""Hedwig"" is one of a would-be glam rocker failed transsexual from Communist East Berlin and her search for identity in America, after being dumped in Junction City by the US Army leiutenant who saved him. On the side, Hedwig(Mitchell,formerly German Hansel Schmidt, is on a Z-rate tour with her rock band, ""The Angry Inch"" which includes Yitzhak (Miriam Shor, also in drag, but as Hedwig's punk bandana-wearing love) and their agent, an over-the-top hilarious Andrea Martin. The tour is a rebuttal to the teen rock-star oppsite the Angry Inch, Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), whom Hedwid taught everything he knew, and stole everything she had.  (I said a nutshell, didn't I? Oops!)

Mitchell's direction is suberb, the music is the greatest since ""Rocky Horror,"" and the acting has a certain reality hard to find in Hollywood today.

The film will leave you stunned til' the last scene, or in tears, and maybe even a lesson or two. Not for the closed-minded though.

Hedwig or Hansel as that was his name before his transformation or rather confusion, he and his mother lived in a cramped apartment in Communist Berlin, before the wall came down that is, They were left by his American GI father and it was just his mother and him.  THe apartment was so small that the only place for Hedwig slash Hansel could find refuse to listen to his American Rock and Roll music was in the oven.  The two lived together sleeping in the same bed until around Hedwig slash Hansel was into his late twenties and was discovered sunbathing on ruins by his semi perverted prince charming, an American military black man the two decides to get married and get the hell out of berlin.  the only thing that stands in their way is Hedwig slash Hansel's little bishop between his slash her's legs but Hansels mother whose name by the way is Hedwig convinces him that its just a simple cut and paste job and she'll be on her way to america.  but little did they know what they were into unfortunately for Hansel Berlin did not have the best plastic surgens around and instead of a female genitalia or even male genitalia he was left with a inch of skin where something was supposed to be there.  thus the title angry inch.  But to cut a good story short He took on his mothers name Hedwig and was then known throughout the movie as hedwig and referred to as her or she.  and after a few months of wedding bliss she was left by her GI husband for a younger more tight boy. left by her husband and with an inch to work with she took all her anger and fustraion into making a remarkable band with beautiful songs in which she meets tommy gnosis or rather makes tommy gnosis this psuedo rockstar whom was created and shaped into a rockstar by none other Ms Hedwig herself and then like her father and husband left her in the dumps.  but this time she wasn't going to let anyone take what she worked so hard at, her music and her heart.  you see first Hedwig meet tommy while babysitting for his family tommy was just a christian rock nerd before ever meeting Hedwig and the two hit it off they were more in love than ever the problem tommy was sadly not into the whole inch thing and couldn't work it out so like the dish and the spoon he ran away with her heart and the songs in which she wrote and made him famous rather than herself.  the underlining of this movie is all about find yourself and accepting who you are once you've found yourself and its about love and how sometimes you just have to let that one person who feel you can't live without, go.  but enough about the film i command you to watch it listen to the soundtrack and be in love.",1087516800,2,3328,4.213836477987422

If you think that the metaphors John Cameron Mitchell employs are silly or trite- news flash, he didn't make them up.  If you want to disagree with Plato, however, be my guest (it'll just validate your stupidity).  Since Hedwig and the Angry Inch was based upon The Speech of Aristophranes from Plato's Symposium (a foundational text which deals with greek mythology and is really just another version of Genesis which includes room for people of all sexual orientation) you might want to think twice about what you call silly.

Imagine my surprise.  It appears that Aristophanes' portion of ""The Symposium"" was lifted, almost lock, stock, and barrel for the brilliant song ""Origin of Love,"" that pretty much lays the groundwork for the whole movie.  More astounding is that the material is used to great effect, and does both Aristophanes and Plato quite well.  Throughout the movie Hedwig is looking for the other half to make himself whole, and it's a touching, sometimes shocking, always amusing search - and the music rocks.  What more can you ask for in an evening's entertainment?",1055203200,3,766,5.0396825396825395
1650910,5,B00005QW5X,"I'm mostly a classical music fan, and don't even like much popular theatre--I hated ""Chicago"" on Broadway. But in NYC
summer of '98, I was fortunate enough to catch John Cameron
Mitchell and the original cast at the funky theatre where this
play, or rather event, started.  I can't say that I really liked
the experience that much, as the music was way too loud, but the
story is great and it was enjoyable just to watch the crowd,
many of them bewildered tourists just following the Times receommendations, take in this highly unusual production.
The movie is terrific.
For outlandishness, this film makes ""Rocky Horror"" look like
""To Sir with Love"".  And while I am not a rock music fan, I was
years ago, and found this music wonderful and poignant.  And the whole thing has just the right touch of humor and over-the-top campiness.  There are scenes in this movie that one can watch like music videos and laugh hysterically, dance, or sing along.
Mitchell and his collaborator Stephen Trask should have won a bunch of Oscars for this--best picture, best music, best song,
(except there are so many good ones, it's hard to figure out which one's best) and best director.  The extras on this DVD are fascinating and moving. especially since Mitchell is the son of
a military big shot and his family is warmly accepting of his unconventionality.  The story of  how this amazing production
got started is unbelievable.  I certainly hope that Mitchell and his friends don't stop here, but go on to do more in music and theatre. Don't miss it.",1053820800,9,1540,4.720149253731344
1650911,5,B00005QW5X,"It probably helped that I rented this DVD on a whim sans any expectation, but this is a bold, emotional and staggeringly creative piece of work. You'll leave feeling for the characters, especially the lead, Hedwig.
First off, the soundtrack would blow Moulin Rogue out of the water (imvho). Fabulous dance extravaganzas, and a script based on a somewhat offbeat theme (the homosexual protagonist has had a botched sex change operation which was a pre-requisite to marry the man he loved). An engaging narrative and a wild full-frontal assault on the clash between rhetorical and real freedom. This for me was enough to make it worth the ride. Terrific performances by everyone, especially Mitchell, the man behind the stage version himself.
A slight caveat...not certain whether the movie simply tapers off at the end or if that was an intended parting effect, but be aware that the ""plot"" as such gets abandoned about 20 mins before the end of the movie and it's up to you to decide whether what remains is a logical or aesthetic next step toward some kind of arty resolution. Works for some, doesn't for others.
Definitely worth a shot. At the very minimum you'll have a treat of some great music (it was rock I am told, but I digress).",1051747200,20,1238,4.7627906976744185

The performances were very good, especially that of John Cameron Mitchell, who is also the film's director, as well as the creator of the play on which the film is based.

With most of the rock performances being played and filmed live, the energy packs a wallop of rock 'n roll punch akin to Meatloaf meets Bowie meets Sweet, etc, etc.  Surprisingly enough, the music is really good!  With songs that tell the tale's past and motivate the characters through the story,  I found myself humming tunes after the film's ending and 'toe-tapping' all through it.  With a great supporting cast of 'characters', we find our downtrodden rock star muddling through the salad bars of america performing all the hits that an ex-flame stole (and consequently performs nightly in whatever 'arena' atmosphere is nearby).  Trying to get her name recognized for hits, she stalks ex-beau, Tommy Gnosis to catch a glimmer of the fame his has with her songs.  Of course the 'her' in this story was actually a 'him' from East Berlin.  Through a botched sex-change operation, (hence the title of the film) he has a confusing past of angry and bitter memories to conquer before finding his true self and a 'piece' (pardon the pun) of personal fame.  With amazing glam-era songs and fun, (sometimes very funny) lively musical numbers, Hedwig is a real hit.",1051401600,6,1357,5.099547511312217
1650924,5,B00005QW5X,"Adapted from the hit off-Broadway musical of the same name is this tale of an ""internationally ignored"" rock & roll singer who hails from Communist Berlin and who dreams of becoming an American sensation. Hedwig (John Cameron Mitchell), born a boy named Hansel, is raised by a single mother (Alberta Watson) who wishes to see her son do better than his poverty-stricken family. Some years later, Hansel is attracted to a good-looking American G.I, who promises a better life overseas for young Hansel, under one condition: that he undergo a sex-change operation to become a fully functional female who he can then marry. The operation is seriously botched, leaving the now-renamed Hedwig with an ""angry inch"" only to be stranded in a dingy Kansas trailer park on the day the Berlin Wall comes tumbling down. Hedwig then supports herself through a series of ill-fated lounge gigs and side jobs, meeting up with 16-year old Tommy Gnosis (Michael Pitt), a religious type who befriends her and later steals her songs and becomes the rock star Hedwig always dreamed of being. Undeterred, Hedwig continues to perform in the shadow of Tommy's sold-out stadium tour, attempting to make herself whole in spirit, if not physically. The film features several songs by composer Stephen Trask, who also appears as a member of Hedwig's disinterested rock band; Miriam Shor portrays Hedwig's newfound love and back-up singer.
A mixed-bag effort to translate John Cameron Mitchell and Stephen Trask's ambitious rock musical to the screen, this remains a worthwhile movie experience on any account, successfully opening up its heartfelt, often sad account of an ""internationally ignored"" rock singer suffering from a botched sex change operation. Mitchell's fierce, hypnotic performance is as indelible on film as it was on stage - fearful, hilarious and moving. His direction is a bit less remarkable, as the movie offers much to look at, but little of it comes through in quite the same way as the music. The filmmakers too often literalize what should be expressed musically, which robs the viewer of some of the discoveries that might have made the film more successful. A few stretches sag as well, but the movie springs to life the most in its final reel - when the title character takes on a young prot&eacute;g&eacute; (a quietly effective Michael Pitt) - even if it fails to fully reach its emotional mark. Audiences at the 2001 Sundance Film Festival clearly found Hedwig refreshing: it won the Audience Award as well as a Grand Jury directing prize for Mitchell.",1050883200,3,2556,5.044917257683215

John Cameron Mitchell plays Hedwig (Head-vig) who lives in East Berlin before the wall fell.  In order to get out of Berlin he is talked into a gender changing operation so that he can marry a military man and move to the US.  Needless to say the operation goes awry and the Berlin wall falls shortly after he leaves.  As if it could get no worse the music that he writes and performs is stolen by his protege Tommy Gnosis who becomes rich and famous.  Hedwig and his band (The Angry Inch -- see operation) shadow Gnosis at all his gigs trying to get back the recognition they deserve.  The comedic moments are filled with slight bitter afterbite as Hedwig searches desperately for his other half.  He finds that when he strips everything down to the very core that he has truly found his other half and no amount of lovers, fame, fortune, and Farrah Fawcett wings will make any difference.  The music was excellent so if you don't catch the movie you should find the web site and grab the MP3's.  The best song ""Origin of Love"" is sadly not there.  I rented this movie on VHS but I'd recommend it in letterbox on DVD.  Blockbuster is the only video store I know that has it in that format.",1049846400,4,1283,4.348739495798319
1650926,4,B00005QW5X,"Hedwig and the Angry Inch (John Cameron Mitchell, 2001)
It's been over a week since I finally saw Hedwig and the Angry Inch, and I still cant get my head around it. It was either the most wonderful musical ever made, Rocky Horror with far more talent and watchability, Spinal Tap with drag queens and goths, or some twisted combination of all three that had one unfortunate casting decision. In any case, the movie had a whole lot going for it.
Director Mitchell also stars as Hedwig, a transvestite whose sex change operation was botched, and thus lives in a constant state of bitterness and despair. Hedwig and her band, the Angry Inch, tour the U.S. playing horrible little holes while Hedwig's ex-boyfriend Tommy (Michael Pitt, recently seen in Murder by Numbers) has gone on to superstardom and is selling out arenas. But the plot is just a backdrop for the Ziggy Stardust-esque songs of the Angry Inch, some of which are accompanied by gorgeous videos of various types (Mitchell's animated sequences, while nave in construction, have an unmistakable power to them).
The one place the movie goes horribly, painfully wrong is in the casting of Andrea Martin, a woman whose very presence is liable to set the viewers teeth on edge. Shes what would happen if, by some horrible accident of nature, Gilbert Gottfried and Carrot Top were suddenly able to have a child together.
Other than that, though, a minor gem that was, not surprisingly, overlooked by Hollywood. *** ",1049414400,3,1471,4.860557768924303
1650927,5,B00005QW5X,"This movie rocks, plain and simple.  Its a bit more realistic than Rocky Horror Picture Show by many means but still has a strong taste of fantasy.  My favorite scene has to be where Hansel (Hedwig) is laying naked at the city dump eating gummy bears.  Hedwig (also named as Hansel) is a singer.  He falls for a young grunged out guy and basically transfers him into a fem hottie and the guy abandons him and steals everything hedwig stands for.  Hedwig paints a silver X on his forehead and the guy uses it as a gimic and also steals his songs.  Basically the movie follows Hedwigs search for him to get into a concert to let it be known that the guy ripped him off.  He still holds a torch for him though.  It deals with alot of thinking back.
Its a great movie.  I was a rocky brat for the majority of my life but this movie blows rocky out of the water which i found suprising.  Rocky was all about sex where Hedwig is incredibly sexy but it also deals with the heart. Buy it... You won't be disapointed.

True, this movie is all over the place, and it leaves a few things to the viewers imagination, but what is a movie without any of that?  I mean, honestly, I'm surprised there have been any bad reviews.  Complaining that the animation is bad?  Feh, that's the point.  It's to show meaning.  Spirit.  It's beautiful, this movie/musical.

I now realize that comparing Hedwig to Rocky Horror is like comparing Goodfellas to Cabin Boy. The first thing I noticed was how the movie drew me in, from the fantastic opening number to the final credits. I had such a good time. But actually realizing how great the film is, catching the little details, didn't start until the second viewing. I'm now on viewing number five and I'm still finding nuggets of brilliance -- I just noticed something interesting about Hedwig's tattoo, which appears in one of the first and last scenes (pay close attention). The songs are all incredible, the performances uniformly sublime. The ambient noise throughout is surprisingly well done; in the restaurant scenes you can barely hear people ordering chicken fingers, with glasses breaking at extremely humorous moments. The editing -- everyone has the perfect expression in every shot (I love the unwitting audience members). The early scene of Yitzhak trying on the wig carries a Shakespearean depth and import. Nothing in this film is tossed in at random; everything has a significance and you could write papers unpacking its richness. The theme of tomatoes being thrown and subsequently eaten is an interesting recurring thread not many people pick up on. This is artwork of the highest calibre. Yeah, if you're uptight about gender and sexuality, the film may trouble you. But watch with an open mind and the universal themes will touch you.

This is not simply an ultra-fab rock n' roll romp nor is it a dry piece of youthful corruption and ambiguous art-nouveau.
Hedwig is a wildly fun and smirkingly cynical film that, with enough attention, will simply floor you with it intricate design and blinding tenderness.
The movie mood-swings through unshakeable glamorous confidence into freakish misery, furrowed indignace, innocent eager affection, vengeful sarcastic satisfaction and the cruelty that only those closest to you can render.
Backed by one of the best soundtracks in history and a great caricatured host of characters and (in)appropriately comical plotlines, Hedwig suceeds in every little nook and cranny possible. You will likely be taken aback many times throughout.
It isn't really in the vein of Rocky Horror either. Despite some unavoidable similarities, this two are entirely headed in separate directions, (on different streets, in different towns, in different worlds). Hedwig, at its core, has so much more heart.
My vote is there for one of the very few top movies of all time.
Truly, something that must be seen to understand; something that must be understood to appreciate. My highest recommendations.",1035936000,,1244,5.287878787878788

It is like they took Rocky Horror, threw in some Priscilla, Queen of the Desert, and added a generous portion of Tommy.  But you find yourself really cheering for Hedwig, in an odd sort of way.
If you like your movies to go from A to Z with no deviations, I recommend only getting the soundtrack (the songs really are fun if you have any appreciation for glam rock).

Hedwig tells a rather unusual story about a gay guy losing his man-hood so he can be married and come to the US. Yeah, I don't have anything in common with that either. But what I do have in common with Hedwig is just about every other emotion. Hedwig finds love, loses love, and can't let go of the past sometimes. The movie is like an hour and 1/2 rock video that stirred my emotions and had me empathizing with Hedwig, since the story is one of seeking love, seeking acceptance, seeking success, and freedom, and not to mention it is also very humorous at some points as well. I think almost anyone can relate to this movie at least in part. It is a musical but the music doesn't come across in the same manner as Sound of Music. The music fits the story and is cleverly mixed in with dialogue, hand-drawn cartoons and performances. I've watched it 5 times. I've shown it to 4 of my friends and they loved it and were surprised by it too. DVD also has a great documentary that will teach you a ton about how Hedwig started as a punk-rock drag number that eventually went Off-Broadway and then to film.

The last popular musicals were done in the seventies (Tommy, Rocky Horror, The Wiz), and they weren't really emotionally moving. Entertaining, yes - but thought provoking and touching, not exactly.
Hedwig has given me hope. Based on a play that became a cult hit in New York and other big cities, now it's been put on DVD with great care by its creator John Cameron Mitchell. He's done an excellent job of bringing Hedwig's energy and intimacy to the screen. I'd love to see him direct and star in more films.
The music is excellent and the lyrics surprisingly insightful. You have to watch this movie more than once to fully appreciate the intricate story, but the music will grab you right away. Stephan Trask is an amazingly talented writer.

It centers around a German transexual who after a sex change op gone wrong leaves him with the ""angry inch"" of the title, is appalled when his secret gay lover steals credit for his music and becomes a number one chart success and sets out to get his music back. The music is pretty good, but the movie itself isn't completely sucessful. That said it works better as a film because the visual elements including animation add to what is a rather bizarre, unique viewing experience.

It has less to do with gender-bending and more to do with self-acceptance, letting go of the past, the emptiness of revenge, and no longer playing the victim.  These messages are not spoon fed to the viewer by any means and may require multiple viewings to fully grasp.

1650981,2,B00005QW5X,"I can see how this film would be popular with a certain audience.  Hedwig is one of those cutsey/artsy films that is clearly in origin intelligent enough to be really great but seems so caught up in its gimick rather than getting down to telling a story that in the end I couldn't consider this film anything more than a failure.
True, there are plenty of films that don't have half the talent that Hedwig does, but its just that promise with a failure to deliver that's so frustrating.  So, let's itemize this nonesense:
1.  If you don't love the music, forget it.  The obvious nods to Bowie are certainly enjoyable, but the music literally pads out over half the movie.  In a true musical, we actually have the narrative of the story explained and strengthened through the songs.  At times it feels like Hedwig was doing this but most of the time it seems like they were having more fun doing fake music performances.  Why not just watch Spinal Tap instead?  Because the songs take up the majority of the film and bring the tiny amount of narrrative flow in the movie to a near standstill, unless you're absolutely enthralled with the music in Hedwig, the film can't help but dissapoint.
2. What I was waiting to develop during all those songs was a great story that just didn't happen.  I was actually interested in main character and many of the unexplained side characters.  The fact that hedwig was a TRUE freak among a profession of poesers was absolutely fascinating.  Did the movie bother to explore any of this?  Absolutely not.
3. What we get instead of an actual resolution to the nonexisting story is a rather inept attempt at a freak-out ending, complete with sets that were formerly all black changing to all white, Hedwig rips off his/her close, walking around near naked and looking identical to his love/hate boyfriend Tommy.  There's supposed to be something deep with how men and women used to be one being and were split, but it feels as though it was carried off so incompetantly or simply incompletely that whatever message the director was intending feels utterly lost--meaning that really the last 20 minutes are essentially a waste.
I'm left wondering why this film has received such a high rating and so many positive reviews.  Where other films have explored similiar grounds with much greater effectiveness, Hedwig seems only capable of raising them, singing about them, but then gives up.  Or perhaps it was just one big music video?  Hedwig certainly isn't the worst film I've seen by any measure, rather, it isn't a movie.  Just a pretentious artsy pile posing as one.",1026691200,12,2600,4.729490022172949

This is definately a good time, chill out, let's have a philosophical discussion after the movie, kind of movie. At least that's what I did w/ my friends after the flick.  The most talked about point being the origin of The Angry Inch, which is both horrifying and darkly funny. I and my co-horts are always fans of guys-in-make-up movies (The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Velvet Goldmine are excellent examples) but watch this movie for good looks, good fun, good music, and a really good story.",1026000000,,662,4.6581196581196584
1650984,4,B00005QW5X,"Hedwig was my favorite movie of 2001, and I was excited for the DVD. All those deleted scenes to see! And I was sure that John Cameron Mitchell would dish out a fantastic commentary.
The DVD is good -there's a fantastic ""making of"" documentary that's 80 minutes long, filled with fantastic tidbits and interviews with everyone from one of the folks who first invested in Hedwig on stage, all the way to John Cameron Mitchells parents. Great little feature documentary.
The deleted scenes are interesting...so many scenes with Phyllis, Hedwig's manager, were cut out of the final film. And it's fun to watch the actor who played the young Hansel do his bed dances. Hilarious.
But the commentary with Mitchell and the cinemetography (or director of photography...can't remember which), was flat and dull. There were a few interesting tidbits revealed (trivia: what had Michael Pitt been eating before his and John's pivotal make out scene?), but on the whole, the commentary is bland and uninteresting....which is surprising, given the fantastic flavor and excitement of this movie.
So, I give the movie five stars, but the DVD only three...which evens out to four. Worth your time if you're a Hedwig fan, but if you're not sure about the movie, this DVD probably isnt' going to convince you.",1025568000,2,1290,4.976851851851852
1650985,5,B00005QW5X,"Hedwig has something for everyone- love, betrayal, sex, symbolism and fantastic music- all wrapped up in the engrossing character of Hedwig. I found this movie to be one of the most multi-faceted movies I'd ever seen: we are all reflected in Hedwig, one way or another. The basis of the movie, while highly comedic, becomes rather poignant and touching at times, and even the most skeptical of my friends have admitted their enjoyment with this film.
Symbolism is something to look out for, and upon watching this movie with various friends, I found many different opinions on what exactly meant what. The religious symbolism, in the aspect of Christianity, culminates in the closing scene, hinting back at the Garden of Eden.
While the story in Hedwig is, to say the least, delightfully original, the music is incredible. A true musical this is, yet Hedwig is more entertaining than many I've seen. The score only benefits the terrific story line and the songs are some of the catchiest I've heard in a long time. (""The Origin of Love"" song and accompanying animation are truly not to be missed).
Perhaps the greatest aspect of Hedwig is the open-ness to interpretation. I loved the music and the love story; others love the costumes and the sheer oddness of the film, while still others find the humor and animated bits to be the most endearing parts.
Superbly acted, surprisingly convincing, and deliciously entertaining, Hedwig is a divine comedy, a fantastical musical and above all, an overall great jaunt down the seemingly forgotten path of cinematic (or, in consideration of Hedwig's Broadway roots, theatrical) oddity, integrity and loyalty to the true meaning of the word: entertainment.",1023753600,4,1698,5.0462633451957295

1650988,5,B00005QW5X,"Well, this film caught me by surprise.  Sure, I'd heard the raves and critical appraisal, but the plot of the film didn't sound too appealing to me.  (SPOILERS>>>) After all, that's about a German homosexual/transvestite Glam-rock singer who marries an African American military man to come to America, where he has a relationship with a 17-year old son of a preacher who he later stalks because the kid stole his music to become a big rock star.  Hmm.  It certainly sounds like the plot came from waaaay out of left field.  BUT, that being said, I decided I would be adventurous one day and I borrowed this DVD from my local library.
As I said, I wasn't too sure how I would react to this film, but very surprisingly, I ended up liking it a LOT.  The plot actually makes a lot of sense in the context of the film, and it's quite enjoyable.  Still, I suppose you would need a somewhat open mind to see this film.  If you've seen other films like ""Tommy,"" ""Performance,"" ""Liztomania,"" ""Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" ""Pink Floyd's the Wall,"" or even ""Moulin Rouge"" then you'll have a idea what this film is like.  However, the film is the best of the bunch.  How good is it?  It's better than Moulin Rouge by far and the music is from the original off-Broadway production and is just about the BEST rock music I've heard in any rock musical.  It totally kicks ...and rocks hard and had me humming the tunes to all the songs before long.  I believe if the Academy Awards folks had possessed a more open mind, they would have nominated this for best picture instead of Moulin Rouge.  Furthermore, only a technicality prevented any of the songs from being nominated for best song, which they could have easily won.
Bless DVD technology...I practically had the songs from the film on auto-repeat for a few days before I had to return the DVD.  This is probably one of the best musicals to be released in the last 20 years (Little Mermaid and Evita and Everyone Says I Love You are some other great recent ones).  The DVD, to say a few words, has a commentary by the director, who is also the writer and plays Hedwig on-screen.  Plus, there is a cool 90-min documentary about the origin of the play and the film...really nice stuff!  New Line produced a great DVD, and whereas I initially had some reservations about seeing this film, now I am absolutely going to add it to my collection.

1651009,5,B00005QW5X,"This is, without a doubt, one of the best movies I have seen in the past five years. And believe me, I've seen hundreds in that time.
  John Cameron Mitchell is the classic tragic hero, lured into a drastic operation to flee his homeland and be with his sugar daddy. When it all falls apart, poor Hedwig is left to latch onto who he/she can become one with. Again, everything falls apart, and by the end of the story, our valiant warrior princess must either love herself or perish. A dark sense of humor keeps this movie from being just another cheap gimmick flick.
  One of the things that makes this picture work, besides the acting, is the music. The songs are as twisted and funny as the rest of the movie, and help convey the underlying depression even better. I dance and sing to this movie in the same way my mother used to dance to ""Grease,"" and I'm a ""Hellraiser"" fan! Plus, it sounds even more fantasic if you have a DTS sound system.

1651012,5,B00005QW5X,"Think about what rock musicals have been like. It's no surprise that when most people think about the rock musical, they think about midnight showings with tons of obsessed fans screaming as the movie plays out before them, decked in attire identical to that of the characters up on screen. One thinks of cultish style, no substance. In other words, when thinking about the rock musical, one immediately thinks ""Rocky Horror"", and there's a reason for that. Finally, someone has decided to take the rock musical seriously and it works better than one could've imagined. Ladies and gentlemen, whether you like it or not... ""HEDWIG!""
Based on the off-Broadway hit of the same name, Hedwig and the Angry Inch is about Hedwig Robinson (John Cameron Mitchell), and his journey to find his ""other half"". While living in East Berlin, Hedwig (then Hansel) meets Sgt. Luther Robinson (Maurice Dean Wint), who over some gummi bears decides to marry him. The only problem is, he has to marry him in Berlin, which would require a physical examination. ""To get away, you've gotta leave something behind,"" Luther tells Hansel. So it is agreed that Hansel must have a sex change operation. Unfortunately for Hansel (who changes his name to Hedwig), the doctor botched the operation, leaving him with nothing but an ""angry inch"". Luther and Hedwig run off to America, where Luther's wandering eye gets the best of him. Left alone, Hedwig just puts on some makeup, pulls the wig down from the shelf and goes back to her first love of music. That too has its problems: Hedwig gets involved in a relationship with Tommy Speck (Michael Pitt), who steals her music and becomes pop icon Tommy Gnosis. When we meet Hedwig at the beginning of the film, her and her band The Angry Inch are following Gnosis world tour in hopes of landing a successful lawsuit.
""Hedwig"" rocks like no other movie I have ever seen. The soundtrack is (in my humble opinion) full of classic songs, and the film is full of audacious numbers to match them. I could easily be convinced that this film was made for upwards of $25 million. But obviously, style isn't dictated by budget (the film was made for $6 million). Just look at ""Wig in a Box,"" where a trailer wall is kicked down to become a stage. Or ""Angry Inch"", where Hedwig's bold retelling of his past lashes out and causes the whole place to erupt. The music could've easily been tacky, but no. The songs, written by Stephen Trask, are punk rock masterpieces (some highlights including ""Origin of Love"", ""Midnight Radio"" and ""Wig in a Box"") that had me singing for days after. I am now convinced that the music industry would be on its way to redemption if more people could write with the gusto and originality of Stephen Trask's work.
The film's characters all have stunning emotional depth. Every character is developed, the relationships seem real, and they are all acted to perfection. That there is already more than you can say about most rock musicals. ""Hedwig"" is the brainchild of John Cameron Mitchell. He knows ""this punk rock star"" up and down and thus turns in a near flawless performance. Hedwig is bitter, stubborn and sarcastic, but never unpleasant for the audience to be with. Michael Pitt is impressive as the rip-off artist Tommy Gnosis, and Miriam Shor gives a wonderfully layered performance as Yitzak, Hedwig's husband/wife obviously unsure of her place in the world (just like Hedwig herself).
""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" has done what no other rock musical has done before. It refuses to give up the music for the story, or vice versa. Instead, the songs complement Hedwig's journey in such a way that we understand her position even more after each one. Now only one question remains: is ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" the greatest rock musical ever made? Hell, yeah.",1018656000,9,3804,4.7914764079147645

1651014,5,B00005QW5X,"Written, directed and starring John Cameron Mitchell,this film categorizes itself as a ""post-punk rock neo glam rock musical"". I say it's in a category of it's own.  And it completely blew me away.
Hedwig is the most outrageous transsexual character that has ever graced the stage or screen.  The audience gets to know Hedwig as a REAL person and not a cartoon character. We see his childhood in East Germany, his romance with an army sergeant, the pressure he feels to have a gender change operation in order to marry his love and leave the oppression of the communist world.  This story and the subsequent plot complications are told in flashback against a background of original rock music, whose lyrics throb with the meaning of love and the nature of gender.  The sets are original and there's even a sequence where the audience is invited to sing along by following a bouncing ball.  The story races along and there are animation sequences as Hedwig searches after lost love and a quest for gender identification.  The costumes and wigs are magnificent and the camerawork makes the most of the space and balance of energy.  It's an elaborate production.  And it also has something important to say.
I loved the lights, the action, the camera, the costumes, the music, the story.  But most of all I the loved the characters.  Hedwig is simply wonderful!  It's not for children though, or religious fundamentalists, or people easily disturbed by transsexualism.

I was more than a little irked when professional reviewers and friends alike repeatedly told me last summer than Hedwig was ""better than Moulin Rouge.""  I enjoyed Moulin Rouge very much, thank you, and I was not interested in some artsy take on a similar theme.  Alas, despite my best efforts, Hedwig won me over.  If only I could get the appropriate hat-thingie, I would be a yet-another Hed-head.
Hedwig is good for all the reasons Moulin Rouge was good: it is a fun, campy, musical pleasurefest for the eyes and ears.  But Moulin Rouge was a story created around songs, while Hedwig's songs come from her story-- and we really believe her heart.
I thought I understood Hedwig when I saw it in the theater the first time.  When I went back, I caught many thoughts that I missed.  Now-- after an embarassingly large number of views on DVD-- I look back in wonder at how I missed so much.  Hedwig is bitter-- and has more reason to be than any of the bitter people I have ever come across (or have come across me).  Life has dealt her some severe blows, but her wit and her music keep her afloat... barely.  It takes Hedwig many years to realizes that despite all the changes she has been through, it is still her blind, unquestioned belief that she lacks what it takes to be whole-- a myth many believe in-- that drags her down.
Hedwig is a story of transformation.  Once a viewer gets over the male-female dichonomy she personifies, we see that the change she made physically from man to not-a-woman-or-a-man does not cut as deeply as the emotional changes from being betrayed by her father, mother, and lovers.
John Cameron Mitchell is completely believable as Hedwig.  Oddly, Miriam Shor's performance as Yitzak is so well executed it gives me the creeps.  But it is Michael Pitt's Tommy Gnosis that looks most at home on the screen.  I expect that Hedwig and ""Bully"" will be early mentions in a long career for this guy.
This film is richer with multiple viewings, so let me put on some advertising spin: Hedwig is the movie that keeps on giving.  It fills you up and never lets you down.  It is the taste of a New Generation.

Normally I can't stand musicals, but this one has some awesome tunes by Stephen Trask, one of the most gifted songwriters to come along in ages, It's a shame Hedwig and the Angry Inch aren't a real band because any one tune on the soundtrack is better than any given handful of songs on modern rock radio. Trask takes us back to the good old glam rock of David Bowie; it's amazing how faithfully he recreates that style of music.

Not only that, but it accomplishes all that while still providing some very intelligent humor, and delightful music. (buy the soundtrack, its worth it!)
This amazing rock musical is certainly one of my top ten this year, maybe my top ten ever.  It is certainly one of the funniest films I've seen.  ""Hedwig"" is a very heartwarming tale, though it deals with off-beat subject matter.  I suggest everyone rush out to rent this movie.  And if you have the chance, get the DVD.  It is chalk full of amazing features.  I especially suggest you watch ""The Story of Hedwig.""  It shows you the off-broadway roots that came to be the masterpiece it is today.",1012867200,,1384,4.7012448132780085
1651062,5,B00005QW5X,"I'm shocked by all of the bad reviews of one of my FAVORITE films of 2001 (up there with ""Mulholland Dr.,"" ""Ghost World,"" and ""Memento)... The story is redicously cheeky (which is always a good thing) and not pompous and superficial , like ""RHPS."" The music and the music scenes outshine anything ""Moulin Rouge"" attempted to do ... The acting and phototgraphy are beyond expectations for a LOW-BUDGET stage adaptation. My only problem is the storytelling. It has so many plot holes, is so short, and leaves so much to question, like how did Hedwig meet Yitzag? (which is explained in a deleted scene, that really shouldn't have be left out, on the DVD), What happens to Hedwig after the end of the film? Will (s)he ever regain he(r) career? Where did the Angry Inch (the band) come from? Do any members of the band have a persona? What happens to Tommy? Will he and Hedwig get back together? What happens to Hedwig's mother? What happened to the Korean wives? Does Hedwig win the lawsuit? These may sound off-the point compared to the deep ""Origin oflove"" themes of the film, but they still linger even after the metaphysical finale.

Like a lot of musicals, and a lot of films, for that matter, it gets a teensy bit wobbly toward the end, but so what? Mitchell's performance is great, the movie is hilariously original, and Hedwig's quest is honestly quite moving. But best of all, the DVD package is great. It includes a 90 minute documentary that's an outstanding complement to the feature, practically as enjoyable as the movie itself. I liked the year's other reinvention of the musical (""Moulin Rouge"") and its DVD release as well.

1651068,4,B00005QW5X,"Meet Hans, an East Berlin teenager desperate to escape the communist block who undergoes a botched sex change operation in order to marry an American military man and flee to the free world.  Now meet Hedwig, the rock-em-shock-em punk band leader into which Hans transforms himself when his American husband abandons him in the midwest.  Embittered when the Berlin wall falls and furious when a later teenage-lover steals her music and becomes an arena-filling rock star, Hedwig now dogs the teenager's steps by staging a tour with her own band and following him from town to town.
John Cameron Mitchell, who co-wrote and starred in the New York show and who appears in the film as both director and star, mutes the more savage tones of the material in favor of pathos and a broader sense of the character's humanity; consequently, the film isn't really as far-out or edgy as it might seem, so it lacks the sharp bite you might expect.  The film also seems a bit unfocused, a bit unstructured, and at times I felt a bit frustrated by what it leads you to expect but never actually delivers.  Even so, Mitchell and company (especially Miriam Shor), give some extremely interesting and often drop-dead funny performances, and the music performed by the band as it tours is first rate throughout.
Sadly, some viewers will reject the film without seeing it on the basis of subject matter alone--which would be a mistake.  Often funny, often touching, and certainly thought-provoking, HEDWIG packs a solid punch by appealing to the untapped creativity in all of us and leads us to question our own internal sense of unity.  The characters and ideas it presents linger in mind afterward, and while Hedwig and her angry inch aren't quite as knock-out as you could wish they're still fascinating.
The DVD contains lots of extras, most notably a documentary (almost as long as the movie itself) that describes the creation of both stage show and film.  The footage of the New York show is particularly fascinating.",1011139200,12,2005,4.86217008797654

Stephen Trask has written songs that rock at one point, and turn touchingly poignant the next.  Mix in a lot of wild costumes and witty one-liners, and you've got an amazing film.

1651095,5,B00005QW5X,"Hansel is a young boy growing up in communist East Berlin.
Hedwig Robinson is a divorced Army wife following her former lover turned Rock Icon, Tommy Gnosis, with her band ""The Angry Inch"".
How Hansel becomes Hedwig, and how Hedwig becomes whole, is the story told in ""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"".
A lot of people have drawn comparisons between ""Hedwig"" and ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"", and while both are glam rock musicals with a bit of ""gender-bending"" that started out as stage shows, that's about where the similarities end.
Where ""Rocky Horror"" is a sexual farce loosely based on Frankenstein, ""Hedwig"" takes it's direction from Aristotle's speech (from Plato's Symposium) on  the origin of love, essentially that once upon a time, humans had twice the arms, legs, and faces we have now, but were cut in two by the gods for being too proud - love comes from a desire to find the half we were seperated from.
Hansel's search leads him to an American GI who asks to marry him, but with the stipulation that ""in order to leave, you have to leave a little somtehing behind"".  Hansel adopts his mother's name and hesitantly undergoes a botched sex change (in the same fashion as a back alley abortion), which leaves him with an ""angry inch"" of flesh.
A year later, a newly divorced woman scraping by on odd jobs and babysitting gigs, Hedwig meets and falls in love with Tommy Speck, whom she soon decides is her ""other half"".  When Tommy decides he can't handle who (what?) she is, and runs away to become a rock star with the songs they wrote together, Hedwig takes to stalking him, shadowing his tour with a tour of her own through a chain of seafood restaurants.
As an unconventional love story whose ultimate message is ""love thyself"", ""Hedwig"" is a movie with a lot of laughs and a lot of heart.  in creating an over the top, in your face star who's alternately cruel and heartbroken, John Cameron Mitchell manages to give us a completely (and surprisingly) believable character that despite having little in common with, almost everyone can identify with.
As if the movie weren't fabulous enough, the dvd comes with extended footage, a commentary by JCM and director of photography, some of the best menu design I've yet to see on a dvd, and best of all, a wonderful feature length documentary on the history of ""Hedwig"" from the first performance at Squeezebox to the present, including interviews with ""Hed-Heads"" (fans) discussing how much it's meant to them and how much a part of their lives it's become.",1009584000,35,2515,4.722095671981776
1651096,4,B00005QW5X,"I love movies. Especially when they're good. And when I hear from enough people that a film is good, I try to make time for it.
I heard from enough people that ""Hedwig"" was good but I couldn't get all that anxious to see it. I'd seen the preview. It reminded me of ""Priscilla,"" drag queen on the road, ho-hum. I just assumed I knew what I was going to see.
I haven't been so wrong about a movie since I was dragged to see ""Election,"" all the while complaining, ""Who cares about a movie about a high school campaign?"" Well, it turned out, I did. And very much.
Same situation with this film. From the moment Hedwig lifts her wing-like cape and launches into the first song, I was wide-eyed.
John Cameron Mitchell's performance would be amazing even if he hadn't written and directed the movie. Since he did, I'd say that it's one of the most astonishing triple-threat debuts since ""Citizen Kane."" Hold on: I'm not saying it's as good as ""Citizen Kane,"" I'm saying it's somewhere on that list. But that's a good list to be on.
I want to also point out a great performance by the actor who played Yitzak, but I fear that saying too much might spoil one of the movies better surprises (whether you caught on from the get-go or near the end, it's still a nice reversal). Yitzak rocks the house.
And the songs. They're great. Infectious. Catchy. Clever. ""Wig in a Box"" is like a letter-perfect transmutation of a classic Billy Joel song and what the film does with it is eye-popping. ""Sugar Daddy"" ""Angry Inch"" they're just fantastic.  The whole thing is like a new Ken Russell movie, except it won't make you car sick.

1651122,5,B00005QW5X,"""Hedwig and The Angry Itch"" comes at a critical time when popular arts, specifically acting/theatre and rock music, have sunk to an all-time low.

Who knew that a movie/play/satire about a East German tranvestite rock and roller would be such an inspiring movie? I sure as hell didn't when I first viewed this during the summer. I walked out of the theatre with a lot of hope for the future.

Face it, actors/actresses don't know how to act anymore without exhibiting some degree of self-consciousness. John Cameron Mitchell, who also conceived the original play and did a terrific job of directing, gets 100 into the role of Hedwig, a character that is flamboyant, absurd, funny, heartbreaking and a terrific communicator. And the man is the first genuine rock and roll heart I have connected with in too long a time. Even though it's a ficticious character, he blows away a good percentage of today's, ahem, ""rock"".

The lovely Miriam Shor is terrific playing a man (in this case, Yitzak, Hedwig's love interest) and shows an amazing energy, dramtic flair and punk rock spirit. A ballsy performance and an excellent example of losing yourself in the role and making it effective.

And the music? You like Punk, Gothic, Glam, Rockabilly, Heavy Metal, Psychedelia and good ol' knees up singalong? Look no further. This is some of the very best TRUE ROCK MUSIC (and Show music) that I have heard in ages. Catchy, nervy and rocks like hell.

The film is a remarkable acheivement. What could have turned into a routine filmed performance or even a performance piece, is actually a fine story with great editing, energy and plenty of color. It could have been a garish display, but Mitchell has done the impossible by keeping the camp and making a truly focused work. Let's see more form him.

The DVD comes with a remarkable 80+ miniute documentary about the history of ""Hedwig"" and interviews with all involved. This is truly indispensible stuff and highly entertaining.

Multi-media pieces usually don't work in the cinematic realm. John Cameron Mitchell has succeeded in this impossible accomplishment and also created what is a long overdue creation in cult cinema.

And that is? The first TRUE rival to ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"". Give Rocky credit for starting the genre, but give John Cameron Mitchell plenty for taking it further and producing a labor of love on every level.

I will never tire of ""Hedwig"". It is most welcome in this current era of pop atrocity (Robbie Robertson croaking Supertramp? Yeah, right...).",1008288000,16,2528,4.915492957746479
1651123,5,B00005QW5X,"""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" bursts onto the screen with a ferocity and rock-and-roll energy not seen since the great rock operas of the 1970s. Not only can it claim to have taken ""Rocky Horror""'s crown as the best cult musical of all time, but it's also one of the best musicals ever put on film. It is second only to another movie musical that was released this year, ""Moulin Rouge."" What do these two films have in common? They are both rock operas about people trying to find love. And that is where the similarity ends. How fitting that in the year 2001, the movie musical genre, which many have considered dead for the past 20 years, can be revitalized and reenergized and deconstructed by these two brilliant productions.
""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is, ostensibly, the story of a gay man, growing up in East Berlin in the days before the Wall fell, who reluctantly agrees to have a sex change operation, so that he can marry an American G.I., and leave for America. Unfortunately, the operation is done incorrectly, leaving Hansel, now Hedwig, with a one-inch mound of flesh where his male member once was. As if that was not enough bad luck for her, her new husband, soon after bringing her to America, leaves her for another man. Hedwig is left high and dry, the very week that the Berlin Wall is torn down. ""Good things come to those who wait,"" says the television announcer. This inspires Hedwig to go on a journey of self-discovery; to discover her other half, her soulmate--but is it a man or a woman? And where does she fit in, in the grand scheme of things? Is she meant to be a male, as she was born, or a female, as she became?
That is when we, the audience, realize that this is not merely a simple story of a down-on-her-luck drag queen trying to make it in the Big World. This is a film about the search for the Platonic ideal, blending the mythic and mundane into a fascinating exploration of what it means to be complete. Is Hedwig's mother right in saying, ""To be free, one must give up a little part of oneself""? Or is Hedwig's lover, Tommy Gnosis, when he tells her that ""there's no mystical design/no cosmic lover preassigned""? The film uses the Berlin Wall as a symbol of the division between two soulmates. Hedwig believes that no one is complete until he or she has found his soulmate. Once they are reunited, one has finally found oneself. Like Berlin finally reunited, Hedwig longs for that herself.
""Hedwig"" plays like a cross between a documentary-style film a la ""This is Spinal Tap,"" an MGM movie musical, an episode of ""Behind the Music"" (including tabloid covers and a clip of Hedwig on ""The Rosie O'Donnell Show""), and ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show."" But it is so much more than that, based mostly on (1) its use of complex symbolism and mythical allusions and (2) the brilliant, heartfelt, funny, and sad performance of John Cameron Mitchell, who wrote, directed, and starred in both the original off-Broadway production of ""Hedwig"" and this film. The man is a creative genius and should receive a Best Actor Oscar nomination.
And what of the music? Simply brilliant, as well. ""Hedwig"" boasts, bar none, one of the best rock opera score of all time, except for, perhaps, ""Rent."" The music is raw energy incarnate. The melodies are amazingly tuneful, and range from hardcore punk to rock n' roll, to folksy, to soft, but never overly sappy, ballads. The lyrics are a revelation: more mature, nuanced, and finely tuned than any songs you are likely to hear in any other Broadway or rock venue. And, yes, contain a great deal of mythical, literary, and even biblical allusions.
The musical numbers are staged brilliantly, particularly ""Wig in a Box,"" my favorite song in the film. A grungy trailer opens up and transforms itself into a beautiful, shiny, brightly colored stage for a great rock number. It's flights of fancy like this that make ""Hedwig"" so much fun.
The film also contains amazing work from its supporting cast, including Miriam Shor, playing Hedwig's husband, and Andrea Martin, playing Hedwig's publicist.
If you are looking for a rock musical that really rocks, but also has a very complex, multilayered, thought-provoking story under its shiny, glitzy veneer, look no further than ""Hedwig."" And you might want to consider buying the soundtrack, as well. The songs are impossible to get out of your head, but in a good way.
And I didn't even get to mention how hilariously funny the film is, as well. You will laugh long and hard; you will find yourself singing along to the music; and yes, you'll also find yourself extremely touched.",1008288000,60,4591,4.683168316831683

But I have to say that even being a perfectly regular straight guy who is not into cross dressing movies, this is still a great movie.  It is a funny movie.  It is also a movie that deals with issues of what it means to be masculine and what it means to be different.  Hedwig, seems to be at first glance to be a gay character, but it as the story reveals, it is not about being gay or straight it, it is about love and accepting who one is.  Hedwig asks himself who is is perfect partner and what they would look like.  The movie examines the issue of finding one's own person, not necessarily being gay or being straight.  Hedwig at the end defines himself as a person and comes to grips with that realization.  That is what the movie is about.  Plus it benefits from really good music.

Filled with drama, poignant comedy and witty dialogue, I came out of this movie with pure joy.  This is the reason why I am a movie lover.  After sitting through a lot of mediocre films this year, it is movies like Hedwig that give me affirmation.  Unfortunately, I don't think this will receive the accolades that it deserves come awards season but it deserves to be up there with the best of them.

1651153,4,B00005QW5X,"Had 'this is Spinal Tap' been concerned with people whose fates and inner lives we could identify with, we might have seen how material that makes us laugh uncontrollably could quickly become tragic.  And 'Hedwig and the Angry Inch' - the story of the transsexual leader of a 70s-style glam rock band, playing to restaurant audiences of single figures or less as she stalks the stadium rocker ex-lover who stole her songs; whose love life is a rondelay of promise, ecstasy, betrayal and rejection; whose dismal career forces her into prostitution - constantly teeters on the brink of the tragic.
that it doesn't (quite) is largely due to the combusitble energy of the film, the inherent buoyancy of the musical genre, and the sympathy generated by John Cameron Mitchell's engaging performance, a classic queen's mixture of bravura and tears.  I say 'combustible' energy, because the film doesn't really have a plot, but moves like it does, and so threatens to expend itself - this can maim the emotional crescendos it strives for.  'Hedwig' was originally a stage musical, and the film works best as a kind of revue, with Hedwig on stage 'performing' and elucidating her life-story, illustrated by stylised, amusing, poignant flashbacks (the best being a candy-glutted sexual awakening at the hands of a huge Barry White-voiced American G.I.).
the film mixes the musical, cabaret, the rites-of-passage, the (small-scale) show-biz satire and romantic comedy, with animation and collage, and the overall theme concerns unity and separation - Hedwig's anxieties about gender and sexual belonging; her origin as the son of an American soldier and East German communist, and how this relates to Cold-War Germany and the collapse of the Berlin Wall; the links between her life and work, her public persona and private emotions, the paradox that she finds her greatest emotional articulacy and authenticity caked in make-up, fright-wig and glittering clothes.
while I would rather leap over sleeping alligators than listen to them in 'real' life, the songs, kind of Iggy/Ziggy/Velvets/New York Dolls rewritten by Jim Steinman, are hugely exciting, the audience even invited to sing along at one point (mine didn't), doing what songs in musicals should do - make the ordinary seem extraordinary, and give voice to the unspoken.  As well, in this case, as provoke and confront.",1004054400,6,2368,5.19109947643979
1651154,5,B00005QW5X,"Wow!""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" explodes from its opening scene and never stops! Wondefully written and performed, it is a work of art that trancends color, culture or gender.
  I first saw John Cameron Mitchell on broadway in the musical ""The Secret Garden"". I loved his work then, but never could've imagined that he would later emerge as the powerhouse that is Hedwig. She is unforgettable!
  Part Scarlet O'Hara and part Terminator, Hedwig is a heroine (or hero) for the new millenium. John Cameron Mitchell plays her so flawlessly and furiously that soon we forget him and she becomes so real that when the movie ends we're left a bit sad that she was indeed a character. If Mr. Mitchell is not nominated for a best-actor Oscar/Golden Globe for this role (and wins), there is no justice. Although the film is not a #1 box office hit, I am hoping that he will get it on buzz alone, which was what got Hilary Swank her VERY deserved awards for ""Boys Don't Cry"".
  The film's script is incredibly original and fresh. It also features clever symbolism. And it's real symbolism, you know the one audiences can actually follow. Not the kind that people tout as ""brilliant"" simply because they don't want to say ""Huh? I didn't get it."" The whole East and West Berlin as a metaphor for Hedwig's search for her missing half is great.
  And then of course, there's the music. Wow, the music! No soundtrack has rocked with more honesty since Prince's ""Purple Rain"" or Bette Midler's ""The Rose"". The lyrics are phenomenal as is the music, both by Stephen Trask. The songs are electric, sincere and humorous. Some of my favorites include; ""Tear Me Down"", ""Wig in a Box"", ""Sugar Daddy"" and ""Midnight Radio"". Mr. Trask deserves to be accepting some awards in this category since no movie this year has featured better music.
  So ignore any comparisons to ""Rocky Horror"" or ""Pricilla"", while well intended,this work sands firmly on its own. It is unlike any other. Unique, brave, bold and extremely beautiful, Hedwig is a winner! Now I wonder if John Cameron Mitchell will release further recordings by Hedwig and the Angry Inch. I hope so.",1004054400,14,2130,4.732432432432432

It's just one of those films, like Velvet Goldmine, (with the startlingly gorgeous Johnothan Rhys Meyers), that makes you want to spend your entire paycheck on everything HEDWIG. The video, the soundtrack, the T-Shirt, the perfume, the book, the fridge magnet, not to mention glitter eyeshadow and mauve tinted sunglasses. And after that, it makes you want to walk down the street crying, it makes you want to scream and laugh and sing - and you should, because very few films will ever breathe the spirit back into you like Hedwig does. It's clever, it sweet, it's heartbreaking. All the cliches apply. Cliches are around for a reason. And that reason is Hedwig. See it, rent it, buy it, but never be content just to hear people rave about it.

1651184,5,B00005QW5X,"I see a light on the horizon. A light that I have not seen in a long time. And that light, my friends is the genre of Movie Musicals. Finally after almost a 10 year dormancy. the genre is coming back and this movie is one of the best movie musicals I've seen in a long time. Based on one of the most risque Off-broadway musicals, This production was adapted, directed, and even starring John Cameron Mitchell one of the shows original creators. Mitchell has managed to adapt his work with seeming ease. The camera working is colorful, energetic, and intense. It doesn't miss any of the important details, and manages to make every scene a unique experience.
The Story goes like this...
Hansel, a homosexal, east german boy, is eager to escape the opressive atmosphere of East Germany. One day he meets a soldier. They want to get married and escape to America. But unfortunately Hansel needs a sex change operation. The operation is botched, leaving him with the so called ""Angry Inch"". well upon arrival in Kansas. The now titled ""Hedwig"" is abandoned by his husband. Well soon afterwards we follow Hedwig's turbulent rise to glory as a rock star.
Mitchell's work on this film is truly visionary, as well as original, striking, moving, and brilliant. You don't often see a film that will mercilessly tell a story with such sensitive subject matter. While at the same time dare to make a film from a genre that most cinematic ignoramuses think is dead and gone. WELL Guess what you pathetic ""Freddy Got Fingered"" fans. Your immature flatulence jokes will never reign as long as there are independent filmmakers, daring to make films that the neutered Hollywood Studios wouldn't dare to touch!

Once the main character's androgynous ""issues"" are established, you can sit back and enjoy a surprisingly traditional show-biz tale with just the right mixture of pathos, bathos and clever one-liners. Best of all, (one or two interminable Jim Steinman-style power ballads aside) someone has finally nailed the MUSIC...most of the songs sound like they were indeed composed by Mssrs. Pop, Bowie, Reed or Bolan and would hold up alongside the original artists' work.

1651221,3,B00005QW5X,"""Hedwig and the Angry Inch"" is good, but not great.  Due to the cross-dressing element, there are many comparisons to ""Rocky Horror Picture Show,"" but I feel that these are two very separate films. A closer comparison is ""Cabaret,"" in the way ""stage performanceas a musical"" is used to interweave character's stories.  Like ""Cabaret,"" the musical is much changed in it's transfer to screen.  Characters are re-written and the all important ""feel"" goes missing.
It was difficult to decide if the director was aiming for mocking the main characters by showing how seriously these pathetic people took themselves, in the vein of ""This is Spinal Tap"" and ""Waiting for Guffman,""  or if he was going for something along the lines of ""Tommy"" where a savaged character found art within himself and transformed the people around him.  It is a difficult line to walk.  We are introduced to Hedwig in the bar scene, where he/she was an obvious object of ridicule, with the silly hairstyle and rock star performance in a small ""Denny's"" style restaurant.  Then later on, we are supposed to respect the plight of the same character that we had been trained to find humor in.
  Ultimately, I found no connection to any of the characters, and didn't particularly care whether or not Hedwig succeeded or failed.  I was sympathetic towards Hedwig's wife, and hopped that he/she escaped the vortex of Hedwig's self-fulfilling failure.

This discovery and the collection of a sugar daddy bring Hedwig (then Hansel) to America and send his world flying into trade wind hysterics. When Hansel meets his sugar daddy, Luthor, he is swept away by Luthors adoration and the promise of a better life away from war torn Germany.  The only problem is, Hansel has to be a female in order to marry Luthor and get out of the country.  Mom has the bright idea of a sex change, only the doctor botches it and Hansel (now Hedwig) is left with ""a one inch mound of flesh"".  This begins Hedwigs long life of turmoil.  Its your basic story, Hedwig marries Luthor, Luthor meets prett boy and leaves Hedwig, and now Hedwig must fend for herself.  She babysits and does the occasional odd job ""mostly the jobs we call blow"" just to scrape by.  She sings at the local TCBY with her band comprised of Korean army wives and meets Tommy ""a dungeons and dragons loving Jesus freak with a fish...  on his truck"" and falls torridly and madly in love with him.  Hedwig decides to fat track hers and Tommy's careers with her anthems about life.  When things get rough, Tommy blows town and takes Hedwigs songs with him.  He becomes a cultural phenom and Hedwig begins a whirlwind tour with her grunge band The Angry Inch following Tommy from town to town trying in her own way to get back what she feels she lost...
