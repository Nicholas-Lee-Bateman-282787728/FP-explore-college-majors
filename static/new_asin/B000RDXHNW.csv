Unlike the Palace boxset that was officially released for the US, this is just a bootleg version of the spin-off series. When I opened up my package, I instantly knew that this was a bootleg copy. Now, I've had my fair share of DVDs such as this but, but Prince Hours was the worst. The only decent episode is the first one.

I was impressed that the subtitles were well done and I could follow the flow of the story very well. But that stopped as soon as the next episode began and only got worse as the series progressed. There were some lines that weren't subtitled period, and most of the lines that were subtitled didn't make any sense. It was like someone closed their eyes and banged on the keyboard with mittens on. I tried to go on watching it, but by the fifth episode I had absolutely no idea what was going on.

The actual episodes themselves are nothing great either. They're just TV rips and not very good ones at that.

I say keep your money and hope that the same company who bought the rights and released ""Palace"" decides to go for the spin-off as well. Unless you're learning Korean and want to practice listening comprehension, spend your money elsewhere. ;)",1214092800,3,1297,4.4411764705882355

Overall, i won't recommend this drama unless u like the actor Seven. The one i got has horrible English subtitles too.",1198022400,5,274,4.729166666666667
