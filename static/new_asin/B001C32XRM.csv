8285705,1,B001C32XRM,I had already written a review on this CD before.  It was probably on another screen.  I am surprised you want another one.,1369785600,,123,4.304347826086956
8285706,5,B001C32XRM,"I love this dvd set! On one disc, you receive a light stretching with movement (definitely needed) and on the second half a cardio workout. It's fast and easy. I am a stay at home mom, and I can get the full workout in one nap time! A super bonus is the personal trainer, it has focused area workouts as well as dance moves! All together this is one of the most enjoyable workouts I have done.",1306713600,8,393,4.116883116883117
