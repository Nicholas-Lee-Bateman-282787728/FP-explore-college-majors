8424833,3,B004D6NQ6M,"Not as good as the first 2, by far. Still an interesting site to see, but don't expect the same intensity. It's not there.",1418342400,,122,4.125
8424834,4,B004D6NQ6M,"I'd say I'm the kind of person with a curiosity; I like to watch foreign films to see the differences between mainstream cinema, and cinema of other countries, or independent film makers. It was also interesting to know that Trent Reznor(of Nine Inch Nails)made a theme song for this movie,unfortunately, the song was played at the credits.
This movie was interesting but I was unsure about the plot, I think since this was a installment in a series and because of that I didn't understand.
I very much liked the crazy camera angles, action, and strange scenes.
Overall interesting flick.",1417478400,,588,4.89
8424835,5,B004D6NQ6M,"I really thought Tetsuo: Iron Man was a great film.  Minimal dialogue, insane premise, apocalyptic desolation, bio-mechanical infections... It had a slew of things that had only been seen in cartoons, but in live action.  Then, I saw Tetsuo II: Body Hammer, and promptly lost interest in the franchise with its overtly cartoonish scenes without attention to physics.  This film, however, revived my interest in a cinematic move truer to the original film.  Well played, Tsukamoto, well played.  (DISCLAIMER: The physics and biology indicated in all of these films is questionable, its just that the second was over the top with it in my opinion.)",1357689600,2,646,5.114285714285714
8424836,4,B004D6NQ6M,"i really enjoyed tetsuo: the bullet man.  it's not so much of a remake of Ironman as it is a reinterpretation of the basic theme of transformation.  i do enjoy the first two tetsuo films slightly more, but that is not taking anything away from this release.  my only complaints about this movie is the quick and choppy editing that is done during the action sequences.  it seems a lot of directors use that editing technique to intensify the action/drama, but personally, i find it distracting and hard to follow.  the other complaint is we really don't get to see any real ""clear"" transformation sequences of anthony (again, the editing was quick and dark).  but saying that, it still is an enjoyable action-packed wild ride.  ishikawa's soundtrack is again excellent too.  i really enjoy that pounding industrial sound and the music goes well with the environments that tsukamoto envisioned.  like many of the previous reviewers mention, if you're a big fan of the first movie, you may not like this one as much, but overall it is still vastly superior and more original than many sci-fi/horror films that are churned out today.  i'm not too sure what's so ""special"" about the dvd slipcase edition as advertised.  it's basically a cardboard slipcase over the dvd box.  no special packaging nor information booklet provided.  i do highly recommend this dvd though.",1301616000,,1365,4.908296943231441
8424837,3,B004D6NQ6M,"If you're already a fan of the Tetsuo movies then you probably won't be expecting this movie to make complete sense.  I love all of Shinya Tsukamoto's films and admittedly I have no idea what's going on half the time.  But be warned, though most of this film is in English, there is a chunk of it in Japanese and the only available subtitles are Chinese.  This is the only reason I'm not giving this film 4 or 5 stars.  If you're into movies where people turn to metal and smash stuff for no apparent reason I definately recommend this film, but maybe try to get a version with English subs.",1299974400,2,591,4.297297297297297
8424838,2,B004D6NQ6M,"So i just watched this last night, being a big fan of the original and not really being a fan of anything else that came out of the director,  I had mixed hopes.

I personally found that the film struggled to make sense, and be explained in some fashion.  while the truth is that it made no sense, and the experience of watching the film was lack luster.  And  that's what the first Tetsuo did so well, it was much more of a experience, and/or feeling then an actual story.  And when your justification for everything is 'he's a human weapon' well it gets pretty dumb.  Much better to keep it to the simple but complex concept of it just happens.  and let the insanity go from there.

well in the end, boring, made too much sense for its own good to the point of see how dumb it really was.

That said the monster suit as always was really good, and the final stage was just amazing.  And the soundtrack was a good compliment, but never felt like anything better.

So the suit a total five star, entertainment value 2 star, and the ""story""  1 star.",1296518400,2,1048,4.258883248730965
8424839,2,B004D6NQ6M,"Tetsuo: The Bullet Man (Shinya Tsukamoto, 2009)

Shinya Tsukamoto, who was always a very good director, found himself a new level over the past decade, turning out phenomenal movie after phenomenal movie; he's the only director to have hit my list of the Best 100 Films of the Last Decade three times (2002's A Snake of June, 2004's Vital, and 2005's Haze). In fact, I love pretty much everything Tsukamoto has done, with two exceptions: the two sequels to Tetsuo: The Iron Man, both of which were, I assume, conceived, shot, and released for purely commercial reasons. First there was Bodyhammer, back in the mid-nineties, a murky, plotless mess that seemed far too focused on the special effects. Now we have The Bullet Man, the third film in the franchise, which if anything goes the opposite direction. Which would normally be great, except that the story is hackneyed and loose. This is exacerbated by the fact that Tsukamoto decided to shoot the entire thing in English, despite neither he nor co-screenwriter Hisakatsu Kuroki (assistant director on Bullet Ballet and currently writing the Gothic and Lolita live action adaptation--and if you're not hopping up and down at the prospect of that one you're either unaware of the source material or dead) has all that good a grasp of it.

Our iron man this time is Anthony (voice actor Eric Bossick), who kind of stumbles into the role after hit men start coming after him because of his tenuous (until they start hunting him, natch; it's there an Ebert Rule about that?) connection to a secret government project to create human weapons (which harks back to Bodyhammer). Needless to say, since they're threatening his family, he becomes said weapon, though he has some existential crises about losing his humanity. But not enough that it isn't really, really cool to be able to just keep going when the bad guys shoot you a couple hundred times.

The best thing about Tetsuo: The Bullet Man, as the best thing about all Tsukamoto films (and I say this as a huge fan of the filmmaker), is Chu Ishikawa's superlative soundtrack. Ishikawa's only equals on the soundtrack stage for the past twenty years have been Graeme Revell and Jeremy Soule, and once again Ishikawa, half of Tokyo industrial band Der Eisenrost, turns in a soundtrack that is both distinctively Ishikawa and perfect for the film. The second-best thing about Tetsuo: The Bullet Man is Tsukamoto's equally distinctive visual style (Tsukamoto not only directs, but does a great deal of the cinematography work; he's also listed as gaffer on this one), which over the past ten years has integrated traditional European thriller style (specifically giallo) into his trademark cyberpunk leanings. It's an effective technique, though probably more so on the sophisticated thrillers he's been doing more than a movie that goes back to Tsukamoto's heavily-cyberpunk roots.

Balancing out those two very strong points are a confused plot (one wonders how rushed this script was), some below-par acting (some? Pretty much everyone here), and a preponderance of the kind of Engrish that manages to be correct but oddly awkward.

I wanted to like it, I really did. But it's simply not up to the standard that Tsukamoto has set for himself over the past ten years. **",1293062400,6,3273,4.954462659380692
