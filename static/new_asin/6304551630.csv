902207,5,6304551630,"Even though the Bluray Im reviewing is not being released until April 28, 2015 (I was provided with a copy for review), there are already 55 reviews posted. Most are from 10-12 years ago. That is because Amazon groups ALL releases of ALL formats of films together and posts on each of the format listings. That is why I always recommend that customers sort reviews by newest first and then look at the format being reviewed. Some of the reviews are of the VHS version!

I won't go into details about the film itself but will say I was glued to the TV screen for the full 31 minute running time. As you will see from ChristineMMs review (from 2002), there is no dialogue or even a music score. Its probably the biggest Rube Goldberg come to life device ever made. It is an Artwork that only existed in that form for one moment. It took the two German filmmakers- Sischli and Weiss  to capture it and their short film becomes its own work of art. And  as was pointed out  young kids will love it and it will keep them entertained for hours.

The 2015 Bluray contains a remastered print of the 1987 film. It was apparently shot on 16 mm as it is certainly not high def, but is probably sharper and with clearer sound (the sound of things clinking or liquids dripping).

There are no bonuses at all. It certainly would be nice to have even a text essay on the filmmakers or the background on the project.  So my five stars is for the film  which I encourage folks to see  but Id give the package a lower rating because they missed the boat by adding any additional background or info to put the piece in perspective.

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

902298,5,6304551630,"Probably the most demanded Play It Again! film of all time. It has its own Wikipedia page, and the Honda Cog ad that was a homage to it was found to violate Fichelli and Wiess copyright of the image of tires bumping into each other and rolling uphill. See ""Cog"" too, but see the original first. Repeatedly. With a child, age 5-105

""The Way Things Go"" is a 30 minute film of a building-size Rube Goldberg or Mousetrap Game-like machine made out junk, tires, ladders, common chemicals, a pair of old shoes, things that burn easily, candles, rope, string, bowling balls, second-hand kitchen utensils, soap, ink, hand-tools, pipes, boards, plywood, tables, pallets, boxes, trash-bags, and odds and ends that appear to be at home in the abandoned factory it seems to have been filmed in. There are a lot of other things as well but no sense in spoiling the fun.

The action starts directly, with a dark, plastic bag, seemingly filled with trash, unwinding on the rope it is suspended by. As it undwinds, it descends, slowly. At some point, it knocks into something else, and we're off! This causes a third item to be released, which is delayed, but eventually bumps into the fourth bit. The movement continues, left to right, with the camera pacing along with at the front edge of the transition from prepared, loaded, cocked, standing-up, organized stuff to knocked over, burned up, scattered, fallen over, poured out, disorganized, stuff. It is, in short the march of entropy, inflicted on a chain of improbable constructions  and cunningly made objects, each of which triggers the relaxation, disillusion, demise, dilution, dissolving, consumption or destruction of the next, but not before the impulse is passed along.

At first its just like history- one darned thing after another- but after a while you realize there is a rhythm to it, things which repeat or nearly repeat, variations on a theme. It seems to be a HItchcockian continuous shot, but you eventually realize that one of the rhythms involves the camera pausing on the curious contents of a kitchen or serving tray, and there is a brief cut, then movement continues. That's how they get around the film magazines being shorter than the film itself.  Whether the whole business really happened in one 30 minute interval of real time, or it was filmed in magazine-size episodes, the presentation is as if it was continuous. In fact, you don't see what releases the initial moving thing, and the motion doesn't stop, the film ends. For all we know its still running, art students and rogue engineers, chemists and physicists feverishly setting it up, outside the view of the cameras, while the edge of motion, the impulse, travels the length of the building, turns around, and returns to where it started. Over and over.

Sometimes one thing knocks over another. Some times something unstable is jarred into releasing potential energy in motion. Often the potential energy is height above the floor, but some times its torsion or compression of a flexible part, or a combustable item set alight. Sometimes its pressure in a container, or simply the contents of a container which run out for one reason or another. The pace is delayed by unwinding and unwrapping, by shallow inclines, by sticky surfaces, the time it takes an object to cross a distance. But something is always going to happen next, if you just wait for it.

I first saw this on Public Television in the middle of the night, about the time it was first released, and I was utterly enchanted with what I saw. Years later, my brother says, ""Have you seen ""The Way Things Go""? I have a copy of it"" and I have no idea what he's talking about, but as soon as he starts describing it... well, I realize I've found whatever that was, again! And its glorious. I take the tape home, where the young child watches it all the way through, laughing, pointing, but mostly rapt. It ends, and all the child wants is to rewind the tape and watch it again! Its a 30 minute, maybe 31 minute, film, but you need to set aside at least an hour if you watch it with children. They'll want to see it twice.

902303,5,6304551630,"""The Way Things Go"" is with things going.  No music, no text or spoken words, but an incredible chain of things happening.  Things going up, down, falling over, flowing, spilling, starting chemical reactions, burning, exploding, extinguishing flames, pulling, pushing, popping, steaming, rolling, and more.

For half an hour, you watch a ballet of physical and chemical reactions that is unpolished, but utterly facinating.  There are rhythms and tempos, changes in cadence and style of action, but it is constant and mystifying.

I loved it.

On another level, it is a superb video for anyone trying to inspire kids to appreciated physics.  Children will sit silently and watch this video again and again, and kids who never expressed an interest in science will ask the key question ""how did they do that?""  And then they are hooked.  And it shows that good science can become good art and vis versa.

A timeless, facinating, and inspiring act of art.

902355,4,6304551630,"In the last century, the cartoonist Rube Goldberg entertained and fascinated readers with his humorous cartoons of truly complicated devices or procedures that resulted in some simple task being completed. This film follows his lead and shows for some 30 minutes, using simple machines (levers, inclined planes) and fire, a series of continuous actions which accomplish nothing in particular except to entertain the viewer. No humans are shown in the film, though their work in setting up the event, apparently in a large warehouse, is evident in how smoothly, more or less, the whole crazy enterprise takes place.  There is a certain underlying humor to the whole thing and also the anticipation of how the film makers will manage to keep the movement going. Bravo.",1235606400,,766,5.128
902356,3,6304551630,"Yes, a very intriguing film. But not stating that it was filmed in multiple takes is misleading to say the least. (Scenes fade out, and new scenes fade in, most often when the camera zooms in on fire, smoke, steam, or bubbles.)

What this achieved was the ability to link separate attempts together should part of the chain reaction fail.

Ask anyone who's built elaborate domino structures and you'll find that just a slight misplacement can bring the domino effect to a halt.

Then, with fire, water, gravity and chemistry, they create a spectacular 100 foot long chain reaction performance of physical interactions, chemical reactions, and precisely crafted chaos worthy of Alfred Hitchcock.""

So there ya go. You don't see them build it, just what happens after it is set in motion. It is truly impressive. I bought this and don't regret it, but I do wonder how many times I'll watch it. Seems like it would be really great for a chemistry or physics teacher to have in their classroom! The students would love it. Or if you work as a bartender where they play silent films on a TV for people to stare at while they drink like at a bar I used to go to.

""Ingeniously choreographed...a Duchampian extravaganza!"" says the New York Times and so do I. I wonder how many times things didn't go the way they wanted and they had to start over?? Judging by some of the mess you see on the floor and the complexity of it it makes you wonder how things went when this thing was getting set up.

Don't try this at home.

902447,2,6304551630,"I had heard great things about this work, but was somewhat disappointed when I finally watched it on DVD.

To start with, the cinematography is jokingly bad. I really wish they would have invested in a stedicam cam rig. There are several very obvious cuts, usually whenever there is a foam or fire reaction. Is this because they wanted to keep the film short and cut out endless minutes of things burning? Or did the chain reaction fail at these points and they needed and edit to hide a ""restart?""

There is quite obviously some ""outside help"" with several steps of the chain. For example, how exactly did the gas get turned on for the torch that heated the kettle? If the gas had been on the entire time, there would have been a huge explosion once the fire got to that point.

The sound effects are great, but quite obviously not the actual sounds from the reactions. I think the film would have been simply too dull to sit through without the added sound effects, so I'll forgive that.

The greatest disappointment is that several of the ""reactions"" are repeated over and over again. Another rolling tire, another fire lighting a fuse on another firework, another tray of foam.

Honestly, the 60-second Honda Accord commercial which mimics this style (""Cog"") is better in pretty much every way. Of course, Honda probably had a budget well in excess of the cost to produce this film.

If you can borrow or rent this DVD, it's worth the 30 minutes. But for the price it sells for, I would have expected at least some good ""bonus features"" that shed some light on how parts of this reaction occurred.",1135900800,13,1601,4.580419580419581

902449,5,6304551630,"The Way Things Go (1987) aka Der Lauf Der Dinge (perhaps loosely translated from German meaning The Laughing Dingo...okay, maybe not...the German I learned in high school didn't take very well) is an odd and wonderful film that I think would be well served shown in the various science and art classes one often has to take during ones stint in receiving a basic education.

In an old warehouse, artists Peter Fischli and David Weiss, who must have pillaged a local junkyard, create an extensively elaborate set up involving tires, chairs, rocket tea kettles, spray bottles, sugar cubes, old shoes, wooden ramps, small carts, garbage bags, balloons, fireworks, pools of liquid (sometimes flammable), gelatinous goo, along with other common, household items, with a result that I can only describe as a wondrous adventure in `planned chaos'.  I used to do a similar thing with dominoes, spend hours lining hundreds of them up, only to watch them all fall within a matter of minutes, but this is so much more.  Fischli and Weiss use all forms of matter, fire, water, and gravity to effect the forward motion (illustrated by transformations, propagation, reactions, and kinetics) of contraptions and such, resulting in constantly evolving concept of one thing leading to another, or, to put it another way, an artistic representation of cause and effect.  I say it would be useful to show this in school science classes, as it's an implicit demonstration and display of the laws of thermodynamics, and presents the material in such a way that one may forget they're actually learning something, being mesmerized by the events occurring on the screen.  It could also me a valuable tool in an art class, as it shows the simplistic beauty that can be drawn from very commonplace objects arranged in such a way to illustrate lifecycles through normally inanimate objects.

I enjoyed this short piece a lot (it runs 30 minutes), as I found myself constantly trying to guess what was going to happen next (synapses firing...mind stimulated...brain functioning...), and often trying to figure out what just happened.  Most of the time the events were relatively easy to follow, but ingenuous in their simplicity.  The camera work here is strictly for utilitarian purposes, following the seemingly constant reaction (the spark of life, if you will) and there is no music, but only the occasional sound effect from the noisier reactions.  I do agree with some of the other reviewers that there may have been some cheating going on here (`hands on' manipulation), as sometimes the camera moves forward when a particular reaction seems not to have produced the intended result, but often, during the more precarious events, the artists appeared to have understood the possibility of failure, and worked contingencies within the set up.  Even if they did supply some assistance in the form of tricky camera work, I'm willing to cut them a great deal of slack as it's the ideas presented within that I found fascinating, the intricate, linear chain of events that must have taken a great deal of time to plan, test, and produce.

As I said, the feature piece runs 30 minutes, and there are a couple of extra features like biographies of the artists and a little text regarding the actions in the film.  I would have liked to see a little more, perhaps a scientific commentary track delineating the principals involved during the sequences within the film, but maybe it's better there's not one, as it may pique someone's curiosity enough to try and learn more about it for themselves.  I am interested in some of those chemical reactions, specifically the ones that created a great deal of foam, as I often find myself in need of ideas for practical jokes (leave it to me to take something beautiful and twist it for my own, devious means).  The price seems a bit hefty for the DVD, but the replay value is here, so I think I'll get my moneys worth.

The presentation is very plain, just the documentary of this incredible sequence chaining cause to effect. There is no sound track except for the noises made by the parts of this wild ""machine"". Even the parts themselves look like nothing special: teapots and tires, soda bottles and sugar cubes. It's the action that counts, and the time and creativity that brought it into being.
Perhaps the creators cheated at a few steps. There are some cuts in an otherwise continuous stream of action.

902505,5,6304551630,"This is a great DVD if you are into Goldbergesque sequences. The production values are minimal, but the vidieo is clear.

902506,3,6304551630,"A comparison with the now famous Honda commcercial is inevitable.  I bought this DVD after seeing the Honda commcercial, but I could not help but to think that the Honda commcercial was much better done.  The pace in this film is much slower, sometimes agonisingly so.  On top of that, there are a number of splices which are anything but seamless, leaving a proof that the sequence didn't really happen.
Still, quite entertaining and best enjoyed late at night with blood-short eyes.",1055721600,4,484,4.878048780487805

I mean, it should all be building up to serving as an alarm clock, or a ringer for a telephone, or a doorbell, or a toaster, or something.  I waited and waited for what I knew would be this killer ending, and... fizzle.  So, enjoy it for what it is, but it could easily have been so much more.",1052438400,2,462,4.157303370786517
902508,5,6304551630,"If you ask them nicely, the nice people at Honda will send you a free DVD of their acclaimed two-minute commercial Cog for the Honda Accord. Watching it back-to-back with The Way Things Go is an illuminating experience, working out exactly which bits of TWTG 'inspired' the corresponding scenes in Cog.
A sequence of counterweighted wheels running up a slope -- check. Rolling objects slowed by a thin layer of viscous fluid -- check. A slow-moving object knocks levers that give it extra energy -- check. And there are many more.
Cog is a great commercial. The idea of having all the pieces in the sequence be parts of the Accord was brilliant. And it's slick and perfect where The Way Things Go is rough and ready, chaotic and a little bit insane. None of the polished metal and smooth movement that sells cars for this piece of German engineering. Instead TWTG uses household objects, ladders, old tyres, bits of wood, kettles and nails, chemicals and fireworks. TWTG's miraculous engine does its job and falls apart -- spectacularly.
Sadly it's no longer true to say that there is no other film like The Way Things Go. But it's still the original, and still the best. And there's no cunningly hidden CGI in this one.",1052006400,10,1220,4.705607476635514
902509,5,6304551630,"this piece of early video-art is a landmark. so different, that even after 20 years or so you rarley see a video-art piece that has so much humor, drama, poetic values and sensibility. to try and look for the errors of the editing is wrong. this is no holywood production or even a low budjet european movie. it is a work of art. and as such it can be made of everyday materials and edited using a primitive cut-to-cut machine.

It is not one long take, it is a collection of twenty segments shot and edited together to give a feeling of continuity, but the cuts from one segment to then next are obvious if you are paying attention. It is an OK ""Student film"" project.. (but considering the amateur camera work, and the nonexistent budget spent on this film it is pricey for what you get.)  Fun with dry ice, baking soda vinegar, alcohol, rocket motors, tires, ramps, weights, ladders, tables, foam and sludge, water, ramps, and a camera... don't try this at home!",1034380800,2,576,4.693069306930693
902511,4,6304551630,"The video is approximately 30 minutes of non-stop motion showing cause-and-effect. The background is an old factory and there is no music score or narration, just the real sounds of the fire lighting, of things dropping down and rolling, etc. A very active imagination (or imaginations) thought up the ideas of what would roll, drop, ignite, etc. to make the next thing happen. The recording is a bit amateur and sometimes the lighting is a bit dim, but the content is so fantastic and real but it doesn't matter to our family because we love it.
My family began watching this when our youngest was nearing two years old and my oldest was four: both were glued to the screen. My husband and I enjoy it as well. Our four-year-old was so inspired he wanted to create a similar and large set-up (with fire and everything) in our home! I was able to convince my son that we could not do a large set up with fire, etc. so while I was busy makign dinner, on his own he made a chain-of-events set-up out of wooden unit blocks and wooden cylinders, and toys that would roll. He called me to see his demonstration and then we had discussions about ideas of what would work, tried them and then brainstormed other ideas when it did not work. I was surprised at the creative thinking this video inspired in my four-year-old.
I am just amazed at the creativity and imagination at work in this video and that such a huge project was set up and obviously practiced many times to ensure that it would work as it was being filmed.
This is entertainment and education rolled into one. This is a welcome change for children to watch from the usual children's video programs that are available (although it is for people of all ages).",1031270400,63,1715,4.5

If there has ever been a question as to weather or not these two sayings are true, ""The  Way Things Go"" has answered it.  I to stumbled upon this show late  one night while sitting in my friends apartment flipping channels.  I sat  mesmerized with my jaw dropped as I watched.  The channel was raising money  and was offering the video for a $120 donation.  If the video had not been  offered elsewhere (like on Amazon), I would have paid it.  That is how  amazing this video is!  I cannot wait to see the whole thing and share it  with friends and family.  A must see!",959990400,8,676,4.330645161290323
