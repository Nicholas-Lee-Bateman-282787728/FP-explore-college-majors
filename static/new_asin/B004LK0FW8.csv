8434446,1,B004LK0FW8,I experienced the same thing. I even purchased this movie on another website and that dvd has no subtitles either.,1454716800,,114,4.75
8434447,1,B004LK0FW8,"DVD:
Although the cover says in large print that it has English subtitles in trying two different DVD players I was unable to come up with either Special Features or subtitles. The movie did display for it's entire length in the upper left corner the word KUMAR for Kumar Films. At least advertising works.

Movie:
Really bad acting, even for Bollywood. The dances were just standing with a bit of movement unlike the usual highly choreographed and intricate Bollywood dancing. Excessive, garish monotonic colors for clothing. Color is a part of Hindi culture but the colors in this film looked like a child's limited palette of just a few, with little or no patterns, bright colors. Songs not up to India standards. The movie's theme has an American West Side story style gang rivalry with the clothing and hair styles and fighting with field hockey sticks. The fights looked like '30s slapstick comedy where any swing that comes within a foot (30 cm) results in an exaggerated reaction from the poor recipient. Usual love triangle and marriage scenes.",1325548800,,1053,4.915730337078652
