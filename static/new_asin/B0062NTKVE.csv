4933065,5,B0062NTKVE,Love these DVDs! I had never done yoga before and they were perfect for beginners. Now I love doing it!,1334361600,11,103,4.2
4933066,5,B0062NTKVE,"Having never purchased a similiar product before, was dubious but given the exceptional price, 'how could you go wrong?' The 3 disk set provides for multiple levels appropriate for any age or level of fitness. My husband is 60 and found a workout that met his fitness needs right away. I have been taking yoga classes for a year and wanted something more advanced. I found several different workouts that I can rotate thru. It is great and I recommend it to everyone. We all need to relieve stress, get fit and breathe deeply!!",1334016000,23,527,4.617021276595745
4933067,5,B0062NTKVE,"The teachers are really good on this set with things to make it easy to follow.  The Yoga Weight Loss DVD starts off with some basic things, including using chairs for support if you need it, then continues from there with a couple of more levels.  The Power Yoga has three levels of beginning, intermediate and advance levels, while the Flow is a more general overall video.  Start with the lower levels of the Weight Loss and Power Yoga DVDs and work from there.  That is what I have done and very happy with this.",1330646400,22,516,4.4
4933068,1,B0062NTKVE,I bought this DVD because I have friends that say very positive things about Yoga and I was interested in getting started. I wanted a DVD I could learn from before paying for a class. This is NOT for beginners. There is no instruction. It is simply routines that move quickly from pose to pose without explanation. I learned nothing from this DVD. It was a complete waste of time and money. DO NOT BUY IF YOU ARE A BEGINNER WITH NO EXPERIENCE!!!,1330560000,17,445,4.373493975903615
4933069,5,B0062NTKVE,"I am enjoying this set alot after using it for a couple of months now.  Like the variety of the different DVDs in terms of time, styles and how they teach you.",1329609600,8,159,3.96875
4933070,5,B0062NTKVE,"I had not really worked out using  yoga before and was happy that the videos took that into account in this set with alot of material to work with that was easy and set up to instruct beginners,

Probably around 1/3 or so were things that I was able to work with right away.  Then there is still alot more to work with later on.  Have done/watched some of the more than beginner workouts, and this will be something I can use These three DVDs have everything you need from, beginner level to very advanced level, so there is a good amount to work with.  The workouts get longer and more challenging, and also include things on some videos using weights and toning bands on one of the DVDs.  Very nice.",1328659200,68,701,4.312977099236641
4933071,5,B0062NTKVE,I love the selection of things to do on these three DVDs.  Two of them are nicely geared for beginning to learn yoga and working out in having a couple of levels and how the moves work while the third DVD is more of a workout that is good to work with in a more general way with different pacing.  Very pleased with this set and how much I have to exercise with on them.,1327622400,7,370,3.92
4933072,5,B0062NTKVE,"I have not had this set a long time as of now, but so far it is exactly what I wanted in terms of yoga getting me into shape. It has a nice variety of styles and approaches in the three videos, from some basic and beginner things to start you out, to using weights and bands on one (I am not there yet in adding these alot) and different style of flowing yoga, a slower one which really works on stretching and strengthing and a faster flow on another video. I like it.",1325894400,122,469,4.0

4933093,3,B0062NTKVE,Did not feel the instruction was designed for beginners who are new to yoga or people who are overweight. Many of beginner lessons I just watched because instruction was too fast and difficult to start off with.,1438560000,,211,4.72972972972973

4933104,2,B0062NTKVE,I did not like this set of DVDs.  The full workouts with the warm up and cool down were too long. The practices on disc 2 were just longer versions than on disc one.  If they weren't opened I would have returned them.,1430697600,,217,4.023255813953488
4933105,4,B0062NTKVE,"Like this DVD,  lots of different flows to play with. Sometimes her voice is hard to concentrate with, it's to monotone. Doesn't flow well, but otherwise pretty good workout.",1429142400,,174,5.0

4933114,4,B0062NTKVE,"So far so good...4 stars because I have not used them long enough to be more descriptive.  A bit about me to frame my review; I was in great shape then was ill for a couple of years and could not be as active as I normally was.  Fast forward to now; healing and ready to be active again but of course, cannot jump back into 2 hour workouts.

This DVD suits my needs because there are days where I can go for 20 minutes and days where 5-10 is my limit.  For those who need a very slow, rehabilitative pace the first sequences are very very good and appropriate.  Then there is the cost...great value for over 30 possible routines!

Since I have not done the advanced power yoga yet with this set I could not comment on whether intermediate or advanced practitioners would like that part of the series.",1419638400,,800,4.264900662251655
4933115,5,B0062NTKVE,Talk you thru the moves with such explicit instruction that is impossible to not get the correct position which of course gives you such a better work out,1418601600,,154,4.535714285714286
4933116,1,B0062NTKVE,They are soooo boring and dated. Their voices are  monotone and dull. The people doing the yoga look weird and creepy. I love yoga but these DVDs are terrible.,1418601600,,159,4.482758620689655
4933117,5,B0062NTKVE,"I love this DVD, got it for the flexibility and weight loss and flexibility... Its awesome I work up a sweat n tottaly love it.",1413590400,2,127,4.12
4933118,3,B0062NTKVE,Good Yoga DVD. There are a variety of yoga sessions.,1412812800,,52,4.3
4933119,2,B0062NTKVE,"First, a little background about me since I find it helpful when I read reviews for exercise DVDs: 40 year old man who's in good shape and would be considered intermediate to advanced as it relates to strength and cardio, but I am very much a beginner when it comes to yoga.  I workout and run (a little) six to seven times a week, but only do yoga once or twice a month.

I was looking to broaden by yoga horizons after being introduced to it in P90X.  Well, maybe I'm simply not the correct target audience for these discs because it definitely wasn't what I expected them to be.  The concept of the performer / instructor not engaging directly with the viewer was new for me (and not one that I particularly like), so I didn't have a great first impression.

The disc I was most excited was Power Yoga, but I found it incredibly show and uninteresting.  It's performed against a blank background in what appears to be a small, cold room.  The weight loss disc is performed on a somewhat windy beach.  I really didn't interest me too much and honestly that had a lot to do with the woman performing the moves.  I found it difficult to relate and so I moved on.  I found the flow yoga disc to be the winner of the bunch.  It is outside amongst very nice scenery and is more in line to what I was expecting.  There are six different routines on the disc, along with a shared warm up and cool down.  I have done each several times and find them to be good - not overly complicated, but providing some good stretching moves at a good pace.  The instructor takes her time and doesn't rush things along.  As a novice, I am able to do all the moves presented in some form.

As I stated, I understand that I am probably not the target audience for these discs, but even so I felt let down by them overall.",1412121600,,1799,4.231671554252199
4933120,5,B0062NTKVE,"Nice set, with a lot of different shows to mix up so you don't get bored.",1409011200,3,73,3.625
4933121,5,B0062NTKVE,very good! exactly what I wanted. love how you can pick and choose different work outs!,1408665600,,87,4.5
4933122,5,B0062NTKVE,"Good workouts.  Different levels of difficulty so you can find something if you are new (like I was) with longer and more challenging routines.  The weights and bands section on the one DVD is fun with about 6 workouts, the intermediate section of the power yoga is where I am there and the flow is good with general workouts focusing on parts of your body and also having nice warm-up and cool downs also.",1407715200,,406,4.472972972972973
4933133,1,B0062NTKVE,I found this DVD set to be INCREDIBLY slow. And when I tried to do the advanced workouts I could not because you need extra equipment to do them.,1406419200,4,145,4.0344827586206895
4933134,5,B0062NTKVE,Excellent source of yoga sessions.,1406160000,,34,6.0

4933136,3,B0062NTKVE,"Of the three discs, I think I personally will get the most use from the Flow Yoga disc (although the different practices on that disc don't differ hugely from each other and all are a little heavy on the sun salutations).  All three discs have lots of options, which is good, but the other two are less to my personal taste.  I see from other comments that the instructor on the Weight Loss disc has a background in Iyengar yoga, and this is apparent, as the practice is very focussed on position and alignment and moves very slowly.  The Power Yoga for Every Body disc is also VERY slow paced, although with a little more focus on breath and relaxation.  In the end, this package deal wasn't as amazing as I originally thought, but as there are some variations on the Flow disc that I will incorporate into my regular rotation, and practices on the other two that I will do occasionally, I still feel that I have gotten my money's worth.",1402531200,5,938,4.436046511627907
4933137,2,B0062NTKVE,After attending Yoga classes I was disapointed by this DVD. It lacked enthusiasm by the presentor. Will not recomend this product,1398816000,,129,5.190476190476191
4933138,5,B0062NTKVE,"Three DVDs really help get strength and flexibility developement.

I like how there are easy workouts, particularly the beginner lessons on the Weight Loss and Power Yoga DVD, while there is also a alot of wokouts to do when you get past the beginning levels.  Flow Yoga and the higher levels of the Power and Weight Loss.",1397952000,2,322,4.631578947368421
4933139,4,B0062NTKVE,"This 3-DVD set has so many options that I am still working through all of them. Some are short, some are long, some work on certain areas of the body- it is exactly what I wanted. I had been looking for programs to use at home to supplement my 2-classes per week. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. My only complaint is that they are in black and white. They are filmed in beautiful tropical settings but you don't get the effect because it is black and white.",1395014400,4,477,4.252747252747253
4933140,4,B0062NTKVE,"I borrowed these from a friend and so far so good. I've been working on healthy weight loss always trying to watch Dr. Oz and take his advice. I been doing okay with the food part, but I definitely need more exercise. So, I'm trying to get more into Yoga but I'm still a beginner. These DVDs are pretty good. Using them along with tips from a new health book I just got called ""Dr. Oz on Cancer, Weight Loss, Alternative Medicine and More"" is helping me feel better and get more energy .

4933142,5,B0062NTKVE,I find the instruction to be clear and easy to follow. I am very satisfied with the degree of quality.,1391126400,2,102,4.15
4933143,3,B0062NTKVE,"I got this one cause losing weight through Yoga seemed like a lot of fun and I thought I couldn't go wrong, specially since Yoga has so many other added benefits, aside from mere weight loss.

But the thing is, these routines are STILL too hard for a sedentary person who is only just starting with physical activity, let alone something that requires strength and flexibility like Yoga. I think I should try simple walking and strict dieting first and then once I've lost a lot of my blubber, I'll come back to these and actually enjoy them and make them work for me, as opposed to the feeling of disappointment you get when you try a pose and have to stop ASAP cause your belly won't let you bend over too far and it cuts your breathing.

Obese people are better off losing weight in other ways first. This is my opinion at least. Or maybe try one of the Yoga for Inflexible People DVDs from this same publisher. Those are easier and I can manage at least the warm ups with the Sun Salutations.",1390867200,6,996,4.349462365591398

4933150,5,B0062NTKVE,"I love this DVD set!  It was exactly what I was looking for, and more!  I am not super-experienced with yoga, but still not enough of a beginner to do a beginner's DVD.  This was perfect.  I am currently using it at 2 months postpartum with baby #4, as my ""recovery day"" workout/stretch video.  I feel like I still get a good workout, without overworking my muscles all week.  I also have very weak ankles, and this is helping greatly with my balance and strength in that area (as any good yoga should).

They are three completely different items with different focus, though they help you start off easy then add onto things.

One DVD takes you from beginning easy moves and works from there.  The second has three levels, with variations/changes/modifications on each level of the moves, so you can start as a beginner and move on to longer workouts and less modified versions of different poses with the appropriate differences in instruction and the last is a general flow, with really good warm-ups and cool downs that can be used with any workout (and which are the easiest) and longer flow workouts.

The instructors repeat every part of every move that you're supposed to do every time that they ask you to change position. It's okay to explain how to do a move the first time, but after that it should be ""now move to downward-facing do"" or ""transition to Warrior one."" Instead you get ""plant your feet hip distance apart, lift your sit bones, tighten your glutes.....etc., etc., etc."" over and over again. It's also very basic and slow so not good for weight loss at all.

The power yoga dvd is odd - one beginner session starts with a modified chair pose but leads up to crow and crane pose in the same workout. I think those should be on very different levels. I was disappointed by the ""Good morning"" and ""Good night"" yoga.

The yoga weight loss for beginners dvd is fairly good. It has shorter and longer options (ranging from 30 minutes to over an hour) and different levels of challenge.

My favorite is the strength and flexibility. This is similar to many vinyasa classes that I have taken at a yoga studio. There is a 25 minute ""General Yoga"", along with specific body part- focuses (core, arms, backbends, legs and hips). While I do not always feel that the specific sessions are that geared toward the named body part, I have liked every session that I have done. Each is about 40 minutes with an option to add a 10 minute warm-up, 15 minute cool-down, or both. I highly recommend this one. I only use the other ones if I want a less strenuous or more relaxing yoga session.",1365897600,2,1113,4.472906403940887
4933233,2,B0062NTKVE,"As someone who has done a lot of yoga vidoes, I decided to give this one a shot since it has so many routines of different lengths and is customizable.

I was immediately disappointed by the ""many different lengths"" that mainly turned out to be 40+ minutes, especially if you want to get a good work out in. I also don't care for the woman who does the weight loss videos, her transitions are terrible and are timed in a manner that either requires you to breathe quickly or have to extend your breathing to an unbearable point. I also felt that way about the strength and flexibility workouts I tried, but I at least felt like I got a pretty good work out doing them. Although I must say I was exhausted due to the lack of breathing. In the few workouts I did there were no ""modifications for less-flexible people."" In fact, there was barely enough explanation of breathing and proper movement for anyone.

If you're a beginner, there isn't really enough instruction to be able to do the video without looking. I definitely prefer Rodney Yee by a mile and will be returning to Gaiam yoga workouts. I feel like they provide a much better flow and a feeling of accomplishing a great workout without feeling rushed through moves. Due to the quickness and poor communication of movements I felt like there were a lot of places where beginners may have been prone to incorrectly complete movements, leading to a wasted workout and possibly injury.",1365724800,185,1443,4.589147286821706

It is rather slow with little breaks between the poses (probably so the poses can be spliced into other routines).  However, the stretches and poses are deep and long enough to really feel good during, after the routine, and for the rest of the day or night.

Use the Yoga Weight Loss one which has some very easy things to do, even with a chair to help you to start, then continue with that level, and the Power Yoga use the Beginner Level.  I tried doing some of the things at the later level to see where I was.  Months later I am now doing the options for going along better once I got a bit stronger and in shape.

And the Flow Yoga is really good.  The Warm-Up and Cool Down are relatively easy, and I could do bits and pieces, but that has come along.
