8042171,5,B0006PJYME,"I happened to catch this at the theatre and in a small independent ""El Mariachi"" kind of way it was fun.  Some of the scenes are dramatically intense, and some of the scenes are graphically intense (think the opening of ""Saving Private Ryan, or the ""cutting off fingers"" scene in Jennifer Tilly's 1996 movie ""Bound."")  The story centers on a young mountain man, who kidnaps women for his own reality-tv show--and as presented the story is entirely believable.

In this case the mountain man, Stevie, is not an inbreed cannibal, but a slightly retarded young man--who is secretly being manipulated by someone else.  The heroine, rather than being a well-endowed bimbo, is well-endowed and smart, and figures out very quickly there is more to their situation than just Stevie's deciding to produced his own television show to find himself a wife.  Because of this the knaptid (kidnapped) women's escape attempts are far from typical and are in fact imaginative.",1104192000,,959,5.0062893081761
8042172,4,B0006PJYME,"A story about a mentally challenged mountain man that has kidnapped several women, and plans to hold a contest to see which one will marry him.  It opens with him following a woman, knocking her out, then kidnapping her.  When she comes to she finds herself trapped with two other women.  She discovers that much to her dismay they all seem to have collars that they can't remove safely.  One woman explains what she has learned so far.  The other seems to be too traumatized to do anything.  After meeting the mountain man she suspects there is more going on than meets the eye.  There is also word from the mountain man that he will be going to get the last contestant soon.  I found this movie worth seeing.  The plot was well thought out.  The characters were actually believable.  It held my attention and made me want to see how it ended.  There are some alusions to incestuous abuse of one of the women given as flashbacks so I would not recommend this for children.",1103673600,2,973,4.465909090909091
8042173,5,B0006PJYME,"Are you a fan of independant movies? Check this one out. This movie takes place in the mountains of Montana and is a new twist on the idea of ""Reality TV"". Young women find themselves being kidnapped by a retarded man who says he ""knaptid"" them. By the time the 3rd woman is kidnapped, the story starts. She finds herself hancuffed to a cot in a little log cabin shed with 2 other women, and they are wearing strange collars that shock them if they stray too far and explode if they try to tamper with them. The retarded man explains that they are going to be on a new reality show called ""Who Wants to Marry a Mountain Man?"" The women obviously want to escape, and I was very interested to see what happened to them as the story progressed. I thought the acting was well done. There is a deleted scene at the end of the DVD and an explanation of why the producer cut it out. There is some adult matter and some violence, so I do not recommend this for young audiences.",1103155200,4,969,4.21505376344086
