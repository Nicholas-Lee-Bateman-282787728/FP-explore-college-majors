1906116,5,B0000AGWRF,The beauty and eroticism of the Peruvian Amazon captured in a single movie.  Lombardi's work takes Vargas Llosa's novel to a new level in both spice and sensuality.,1068768000,5,164,4.857142857142857
1906117,5,B0000AGWRF,"Hilarious, sultry and clever, this film traces the adventures of the dedicated Peruvian Army Captain Pantoja, who is sent by his higher-ups to an assignment deep in the jungle.  It seems the soldiers there have been raping local women, due to the well-accepted fact that the jungle boils a man's desire out of control.  Pantoja's secret task is to form a government-sponsored brothel to keep the men's libidos in check.  With characteristic thoroughness, and at first reluctantly, Pantoja analyzes every aspect of the job, exhaustively researching human sexuality with a scholar's detachment.  This leads him to many insights into accomplishing his task in the most efficient manner possible.  One example:  the provision of pornographic material to a soldier  waiting for his ""visit"" reduces his average ""visit time"" by 36 seconds, thus allowing a ""visitor"" to service six more soldiers during her shift, and reducing cost accordingly.
Unfortunately for Pantoja, the operation becomes too efficient and eventually draws the attention of a corrupt local radio personality.  The dignity that Pantoja bestows upon his employees irks his superiors, and they too turn on him.
Llosa's original novel is brought to life delightfully, and the film is highly entertaining, especially for one familiar with Latin American culture.",1061856000,20,1321,5.4411764705882355
1906118,3,B0000AGWRF,"I WATCHED THIS MOVIE EXPECTING A WELL TOLD TALE AND GOT A WEAKLY STRUCTURED  CINEMATIC DISAPPOINTMENT. I COULD NOT STRETCH MY MIND TO BELIEVE THAT THE MILITARY WOULD LET A CAPTAIN BECOME A ""PIMP"" TO BOOST MORALE AMONG THE TROOPS. IT WAS TOO FAR FETCHED. THEN THE CHANCES OF HIM BEING REALLY REALLY HANDSOME DEDICATED TO SERVICE AND MARRIED TO A REALLY PRETTY WOMAN AND THE ONE ""MISUNDERSTOOD"" HOOKER. ""LA COLUMBIANA"" BEING REALLY REALLY HOT LOOKING AND NOT ENDING UP IN BED WAS RIDICULOUS. OF COURSE THEY ""GOT IT ON"". WHO COULDNT SEE THAT COMMING? THAT WAS THE POINT. ""LETS BUILD A MOVIE AROUND TWO MORE HOLLYWOOD GOOD LOOKING PEOPLE GETTING TOGETHER"". THE ONE GOOD REASON TO GET THIS MOVIE IS THE ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS WOMEN THAT SHOW US THEIR ""GOOD'S"".  THAT ALONE MADE IT WORTH EVERY PENNY. IT'S DECIDED. LATIN WOMEN ARE THE MOST GORGEOUS. THIS MOVIE JUST PROVES IT BEYOND ARGUMENT. STORY,POOR. WOMEN 2 THUMBS UP!",1140134400,,914,4.8152866242038215
1906119,1,B0000AGWRF,"Basically this movie tells us a history of a married Peruvian soldier who was given the mission of establishing a brothel for soldier serving on isolated posts at the skirts of the Amazon jungle. And this all had to be done because the poor lonely soldier were so desperate for sex that they were raping local women. I cannot understand how this deplorable plot can be considered as funny.  I just cannot understand how rape and prostitution can possible be used as a means of comedy. For me this is all just too sad. It is too sad to see that women exploitation is still seen so lightly and worst of all, as superb, hilarious and uplifting.",1130025600,3,641,4.478632478632479
1906120,4,B0000AGWRF,"This is a surrealist story. Vargas Llosa 's adaptation novel was taken to screen by Francisco Lombardi. An immaculate and extraordinarily capacitated captain's army is hired to install a brothel in the middle  of the Amazon jungle, hiring prostitutes under the masked term of visitors to arouse still more the febrile patriotic feature of the trop.

The recruiting process, the building of the local, the serious reports informing about the advances and the strategic planning is a ravishing tour de force comedy, plenty of ambiguities, and double sense jokes around the project. But Olga (La colombiana) stared by the exuberant and monumental Angie Cepeda will turn the plans, when a love affair spout among them. But the tragedy will remain behind the door just waiting to be invoked by dark facts the reason just can not explain.

So this tragic comedy is one of the best examples of that so well known literary current named The magic marvelous ( Lo mgico maravilloso), an imported term designed by Alejo Carpentier a Cuban writer.

Go for this picture if you want to laugh about the singularities and way of thinking of  certain power statements.",1124409600,9,1151,4.973958333333333
1906121,3,B0000AGWRF,"Its not a movie you would see over and over again, but its worth watching, It is about a married officer that was given an assignment, he had to boost up moral for the soldiers in the jungle by secretly running a prostitution house or should i say boat, he ends up falling for one of the prostitutes. Not to much action but drama.",1102809600,2,330,4.171875
1906122,4,B0000AGWRF,"One reviewer called this ""Hogan's Hookers"" but I think ""original and well-executed"" sums this delightful genre-busting film up to a tee.  I was completely captivated for the first 45 minutes as the plot was laid out in a manner that despite its humorous nature was still completely plausible and engaging.  I must admit to being a Peru-lover but even if you know nothing about the country the cinematography is thoroughly professional and cutting edge.  Film buffs will note that the actress who plays the madame Chuchupe is Pilar Bardem, the mother of renowned Spanish actor Javier Bardem (Jamon Jamon, Live Flesh, When Night Falls, etc, etc etc).  Angie Cepeda (La Colombiana) has since gone off to Hollywood, and Salvador del Solar (Pantaleon) continues to make films in Peru.  Many other faces will be familiar to watchers of Univision, Venevision, or other Televisa networks.

As for a weakness, I felt that the film got just a bit too stagy and Hollywood at about the one hour point, when Olga and Pantaleon have their first serious encounter.  Cepeda is put out as the showcase of the film, but frankly I felt her performance was perhaps the weakest link in the whole presentation.  But even Hitchcock was known for terrible romance scenes, I don't think it flaws the film too much.  That scene was soon forgotten after remarkable appearances from Aristteles Picho as El Sinchi, the abominable shock jock radio voice of Iquitos.  And anyone who has ever worked for a poor manager should appreciate the amazing dedication and work ethic of Pantaleon, and the affection his employees felt for him after he leaves.  All in all, this is a real gem of a film.",1096761600,9,1661,4.8546099290780145
1906123,1,B0000AGWRF,"I found this movie to be a miserable, predictable, and pointless experience. The political satire of it escapes me as well as the humor or sexiness. If you want a real satire about military life and corruption, see ""Bananas!"" And if you want to entertain some goofy fantasy about running a legal prostitute ring and cheating on your wife, then see this.",1091836800,2,353,4.709677419354839
1906124,5,B0000AGWRF,"You'll never see a movie with this storyline being produced and released by Hollywood.  It's probably best suited for liberal-minded adults since it touches on lots of taboo subjects, i.e., prostitution, adultry, and steamy sex.  It's what U.S. troops really wanted Bob Hope to deliver when he visited troops overseas.

The other reviewers have given the gist of the storyline, but in a nutshell, it's the story of a dedicated, discipline, career soldier (a Captain) who is ordered by his superiors to set up a brothel to service Peruvian soldiers in the Amazon.  The temptation of lust (a certain sexy prostitute) overtakes Captain Pantaleon.  He's overcome with conflict between duty to his country, his goal to run the best damn brothel, his love for a prostitute, and fidelity to his wife.

Without a doubt, TWO THUMBS UP!",1091232000,11,826,4.992700729927007
1906125,5,B0000AGWRF,"Great Peruvian film here!
It is about a clean-cut, obediant captain in the Peruvian army who is assigned to go undercover as a businessman near a far-off army base where the soldiers have been causing havoc in the nearby city, raping women (since there are no women in the land where they are stationed. The captain (who is a loyal husband and soon-to-be father, spearheads a business in which prostitutes are brought down the Amazon River and are paid to provide ""renderings"" to the soldiers.
Alot of the drama in this dark comedy/drama comes from ""La Colombiana,"" an extremely beautiful ""visitadora"" whom becomes a favorite of the soldiers and her boss.
This made my wife and I laugh out at several parts, though lovers of drama will more than likely appreciate this piece more than those who are just looking for a few laughs. The acting is impeccable, the script was witty, but not overdone, the film quality was great (much better than I had expected considering not many Peruvian films make it into the US market).
A Must-See!!",1084579200,20,1033,4.776536312849162
1906126,5,B0000AGWRF,"PANTALEON Y LAS VISITADORS (Pantaleon and the ""Visitors"") is a completely satisfying cinematic conversion of the novel by Mario Vargas Llosa by the excellent Director Francisco Lombardi. The film is so successful in telling the tale of a traveling boat of prostitutes who are engaged by the Peruvian Army to provide 'outlets' for the soldiers quartered in the jungles of the Amazon (and have been abusing the local women) that what first appears to be a hilarious comedy becomes a rather profound statement about one man's ideals and his dedication to authority: the perfect Military Officer.
Captain Panteleon Pantoja (Salvador del Solar) is such an excellent organizer and dedicated officer that he is the one chosen by all of the top military officials to resolve the problem of addressing the sexual needs of the isolated Peruvian soldiers. He organizes, with the help of a brothel owner Chuchupe (Pilar Bardem), a carefully screened cadre of 'ladies of the night or visitadors', has 'uniforms' made, and arranges a military post where the 'Visitadors' are brought in by boat to service the eager soldiers. The project is an enormous success in every way. Pantaleon is obsessed with his project, much to the neglect of his wife Pocha (Monica Sanchez), and is eventually drawn into an indiscretion with one of the Visitadors called La Colombiana (the steamy Angie Cepeda). From there things begin to lose humor, the project is made public by the wily, disgusting radio talk show host El Sinchi (played to the hilt by Aristoteles Picho!), and ultimately comedy turns to tragedy. The real interest of this film is how despite the ultimate failure of the project, our by-the-book Panteleon manages to find a way to bounce back! A satisfying surprise ending to a fine 'message film'. The cinematography is superb, the jungles of the Amazon have not felt so steamy since ""The African Queen"" jungles, and the acting is intelligent, terse, and informed. There is much to celebrate in this excellent film, not the least of which are the many underlying motives that wear strange costumes but reveal universal truths.

7997185,5,B0000AGWRF,"apart from the lushness of the amazon and la colombiana and other visitadoras, as touched upon by other reviewers, the film nicely demonstrates the hypocricy of middleclass society that includes institutions like the church and the army. as pink floyd sand "" in the end we are all ordinary men"".

capitan pantaleon accomplishes well the job he is given by his army superiors, but when this 'undercover' mission gets the public eye via broadcast of the funeral, the army gets cold feet and want to expel capitan pantaleon. the movie does have a beautiful ending in an isolated post in the andes. yet from that isolation are reflections about the recent events in amazonia.

visually a nice depiction of amazonian frontier towns as well. i am buying the movie AFTER seeing it ( borrowed it from my univ library), to spread the word about this gem from the year 2000.",1151366400,4,864,4.753333333333333
