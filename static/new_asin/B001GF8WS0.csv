The start menu was a little low quality but the actual episodes look nice and HD. The sound is nice and I didn't notice anything wrong with their voices or the background music. It does include the Japanese dub and the English dub. It has English subtitles too! (you're able to edit the setting however you like it)

For the package it's was delivered really nice and it didn't show up with any damage. I was a little bit disappointed with the DVD case because I thought it was more like an actual book (where you open it from the side). I almost broken it trying to open it BUT luckily I figured it out. You pull the red string on the top and it opens from there. This doesn't bother me though so I'm really happy with this order.",1481846400,,842,4.197530864197531
8305241,5,B001GF8WS0,It's the complete set. I really liked how all the dvds came in a cute book of spells cardboard holder box.,1458432000,,106,4.095238095238095

8305243,5,B001GF8WS0,"I had heard a lot of good things about this particular anime and they were all true! This is a fun, fun series that I'm really getting into. I will be sad when this is over however.

One critical thing I can say however is the anime wastes NO time throwing you into the mix. The first episode is so packed with information that I will most likely end up re-watching just to be sure I got everything right the first go around. The characters are delightful and colorful (and quite plentiful) but you really do have to pay close attention to every detail if you don't want to be left behind. After the first few episodes things calm down and you can catch up easier.

The animation is stunning! I wish more animes would look into this particular style because there's so much that can be done with it, the opening and ending themes are really easy to get sucked into (this is the first Anime where I look forward to both and don't skip either for any reason)

I would definitely recommend this anime to anyone who wants to go on a real adventure filled with magic, fun but also addresses more serious things too. A magical trip for all!",1268697600,6,1134,4.339622641509434
