Back when all I needed was a pair of suede Puma's and a boom box to have a great day. It's like a trip down memory lane.",1347580800,,277,3.711864406779661
8389622,5,B003675NFQ,"For those who look back at the early - mid 1990's New York Hip Hop scene with a warm glow, this is for you.  Snippets of Ricky Powell's Public Access TV show of that era, mixed with a few contemporary comments.
Powell was/is a Manhattan based graffiti artist/photographer/scenemaker who knew the world of New York Hip Hop and Manhattan street life from the inside, and so captured essential photos and TV interviews.  The picture quality is grainy because it is mostly transferred video tape, but do not let that put you off.  If ever the Soul of a place at a particular era was captured in a DVD, it is this.  Not really a DVD for the casual consumer, it is for the hardcore, but no less worthy because of that.  A valuable archive piece of social and musical history, it also includes rare footage of the legendary ""Stay High 149""!",1285545600,,833,4.490066225165563
