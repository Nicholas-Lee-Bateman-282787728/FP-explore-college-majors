8106988,4,B000E7ZJ4G,"This DVD might be OOP. I got it somewhere else, but it's a matter of opinion about whether or not it's worth buying because it's the cut R-rated version. Since there's an unrated VHS, and a YOUTUBE version I saw is also uncut, there's no excuse for this to be censored. There's assorted stuff like dialogue that's missing, but there's only one gore scene that I saw that was censored; maybe I'm wrong, but that was the only gore scene I saw cut. Nevertheless, the censoring of this one sequence really damages the film; don't think that just because it's just one scene that it doesn't cause any severe damage to the movie. The gore scene that was completely cut out is that part when the Muldoon Man betrays and mutilates that demon lords face near the end. This scene is graphic and cool and is completely omitted from the R-rated version. I would rarely buy anything that's censored, but I bought this one because I really liked it and wanted to get a better look at the makeup. The movie is simple and deals with this small group of people encountering some demons, zombies, and an ancient creature that comes to life near the very end; I wish that Muldoon Man monster had more screen time. Almost the entire film takes place in desolate locations and sequences in the dungeons where the demons reside. The acting is basically very poor and amateurish, but I thought the directing was fine. There's no nudity, but it delivers some nice locations and atmosphere. It also has very good makeup and gore FX, despite being very low-budget. The gore isn't extreme and most of it is towards the end; I wouldn't recommend it if you're buying it just for gore and violence. I would label it as an excellent late night type horror film that really has that 80s feel.

The DVD quality is very grainy, but that's obviously the way it's supposed to look. I thought the transfer is very good. It allowed me to get a nice good look at all the makeup and locations. The extras are good also. If it wasn't for this being censored, I would give it a 5 star rating. This is among the best of 80s horror and is a lot of fun, which makes it so disappointing that this particular film had to be cut.",1470268800,,2181,4.438902743142145

8106990,2,B000E7ZJ4G,Rented this movie back in the 90's with some friends. It was not scary in the least. The makeup is the only redeeming characteristic of the film in my opinion. The acting is certainly not the worst but nowhere near good. Not a fan.,1418342400,,231,4.2727272727272725
8106991,5,B000E7ZJ4G,all i will say if ur into cheesy horror films this is it. the plot was decent easy to follow. the makeup was good. the acting was basic. sadly it doesnt have the last 3 minutes that the VHS virison has. which was odd on not adding the footage in the dvd. is it worth the watch...yes. some may love it or hate it. in my opioin i really enjoyed the film. thanks to code red dvd on its realese it was a hard movie to find on dvd. and also the shipping was FAST thank you. if you ever want a good friday night classic old school 80s horror...this is it. if u do buy it enjoy the movie.,1396915200,,581,3.85
8106992,3,B000E7ZJ4G,"While I am very grateful to Code Red for releasing this fun slice of 80s cheese onto DVD, I have to nitpick. This disc contains the edited 'R' rated version of the film, missing about 3 minutes (compared to my old VHS copy, which I transferred to digital a year or so back). While it has -some- of the gory effects from the film (including a nicely nasty dissolving head), the exclusion of others is so obvious it's painful (most painfully obvious is how one shot of the 'Muldoon Man' at the end seems to jump-cut, highlighting where a crushed-head effect has been outright removed). Doing a comparison, a number of scenes were cut that aren't even violent content; including a rather effective jump-cut from the beginning that leads to a whole introductory scene being cut out!

So is it worth it?

Well, if you're a fan, or don't have a VCR, then yes. The picture, while soaked with grain, is still much better than the old washed-out VHS print, and the extras (including a laid-back filmmaker commentary and a 'making of' gallery) add a little incentive.

As for the film itself, it's a fun little amateur production from the era of direct-to-VHS movies, ambitious in visuals but light on story. Great monster makeup and loads of unintentionally funny scenes make it worth a watch. Hardly essential, but quite a bit of fun for the right crowd (i.e. those of us who grew up with a love of 80s cheese!).

If you're a fan, seek out a discounted copy; all others should stick to looking for an 'unrated' VHS copy.",1378771200,3,1512,4.588888888888889
8106993,4,B000E7ZJ4G,"This is a fun flick.  Don't pay attention to the picture, which says ""original uncensored version"".  That's a bogus ploy by Magnum to get more sales.  So if you get a tape that doesn't say that, but rather simply rates it as R, it's all the same movie, with no differences.",1350691200,,273,4.313725490196078
