7799958,5,1598037560,"This course is a little too much for anyone who has no background in psychology or the aptitude and knack.

The professor is a genius. Throughout the lectures, the listener gets the feeling that the professor knows way more than what he is saying. He simplifies all concepts for the beginner using examples from everyday living. The definitions on the screen and charts help very much. Some lectures are well worth listening to multiple times.

The booklet that comes with the DVD is tremendous help. There is a general description of the subject of each lecture, important terms, suggested reading, questions to consider, and exercise.

Once the beginner student grasps the terms and concepts, the lectures become more understandable. For those with some psychology background or have a natural interest, this lecture series is a delight.",1342656000,13,839,5.154411764705882
