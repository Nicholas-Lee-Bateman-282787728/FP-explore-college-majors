2861205,2,B000R7HY2S,"James Van Der Beek - best known as the titular character on 'Dawson's Creek' - grows a beard to show us he's all grown up in this psychological thriller. Van Der Beek is very good, but the film isn't. Van Der Beek is a writer who tells his actor friend he has an idea for a horror film about a dead clown taking revenge on the children who laughed at him when he accidentally immolated himself at the circus. His friend gets him an appointment to subit his script to his agent and gives him a deadline as to when it has to be done. So he locks himself away in a loft and sets about writing while being haunted by some not-so-traumatic events of the past (which aren't very well-explained).

Two big problems - one is that the actor character is far more interesting than Van Der Beek's character (at times I wished the movie would shift gears and make the movie about the edgy, self-absorbed actor instead of the needy, bland writer). The other problem is the story he's writing about the killer clown is a far better story than the main story. I would have rather seen THAT movie!

It starts off good, but after too much time goes by with nothing happening it becomes tough to keep caring or even stay awake.",1280188800,,1209,4.345132743362832
2861206,1,B000R7HY2S,"It was time to kill the clown before this dismal production was even made. Van Der Beek did an excellent job portraying the troubled Paul, but the story, editing, and directing was just plain awful. Only his character was appealing, the rest were so self absorbed or just plain nasty that they actually came off as irritating.

The editing is choppy, although purposely done to help imply Paul's insanity, but it actually made the movie confusing. A scene would start, then it would jump back a few seconds and overlap and by the time the scene was done you really had no idea if it was important to the plot or not.

Just plain depressing and dull. But I still like James Van Der Beek.",1277078400,,686,4.48
2861207,1,B000R7HY2S,Final Draft is directed very poorly and the plot line isn't much either.  This movie drags on forever and has no direction.  It's just a bunch of unnecessary loud noises.  I tried to watch this movie tonight and I lost interest after 5 minutes.  Don't waste your time on this one.,1229472000,,280,4.431372549019608
2861208,3,B000R7HY2S,"THIS IS A VERY SHARP AND INTERESTING FILM. THIS IS ABOUT A YOUNG WRITER PAUL TWIST PLAYED BY JAMES VAN DER BEEK. HE HAS TO WRITE A HORROR MOVIE IN 18 DAYS. HE LOCKS HIMSELF IN HIS LOFT AND BEGINS. THE HORROR IS HE IS HAUNTED BY HIS PAST. A DARK CLOWN, A MENACE A NIGHTMARE FROM HIS CHILDHOOD. HIS EX- WIFE, HIS BROTHER AND HIS OWN DARK DEEP SECRETS.

I THINK WHAT STANDS OUT IN THIS MOVIE IS THE ACTING AND THE WONDERFUL MIND TRIP OF A PLOT. YOU SEE THE REALITY OF MAN TURN UPSIDE DOWN AND TWIST INTO A WORLD THAT HE SEEMS TO IMAGINE YET CAN NOT CONTROL.
AS HE WRITES HE SEES THE PEOPLE IN HIS LIFE WHO HAVE CAUSED HIM PROBLEMS THERE WITH HIM IN THE LOFT. HIS MIND STARTS TO UNRAVEL , HIS THOUGHTS BECOME CLOUDED BY IMAGES OF VIOLENCE AND INSANITY.

I WAS VERY WELL PLEASED WITH THIS MOVIE IT WORKED IN SO MANY WAYS. I LOVE THE ONE ACT FEEL TO THE MOVIE. THE END WHEN HE IS LOCKED INSIDE THE LOFT WORKS THE MOVIE WITH BEAUTY AND A TWISTED SENSE OF HORROR WHICH IS INSANITY ITSELF.

THE STORY BECOMES APART OF HIM AS HE ACTS OUT THE HORROR THAT HIS MIND HAS CREATED. THE DEPRESSION OF HIS LIFE, THE FEEL OF FAILURE BECAUSE OF WRITERS BLOCK. THIS MOVIE IS NOT ABOUT GORE OR MASSIVE BLOOD, IT'S THE MIND AND THE AFFECTS OF HOW FAR THE INNER THOUGHTS CAN BECOME REALITY, HOW EACH ONE IS MIXED INTO THE PUDDLE OF DARKNESS AND HOW THAT DARKNESS CAN TAKE OVER.

I REALLY SEE NO FAULTS WITH THIS MOVIE ACCEPT SOME SLOW SPOTS AT TIMES BUT THE FILM COMES TOGETHER IN THE END AS A WELL PLAYED OUT ONE ACT WITH MORE TO IT. IT SHOCKS ME FROM ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS I HAVE READ ABOUT THIS AND I WONDER WHY PEOPLE WHERE SO NEGATIVE I THOUGHT THE MOVIE CAPTURED INSANITY TO THE POINT AND MADE THE VIEWER TAKE THAT TRIP ALSO.",1216598400,2,1710,4.050295857988166
2861209,1,B000R7HY2S,"After having just seen John Cusack's virtual one man show and a brilliant one at that in 1408, one can only feel sorry for James Van Der Beek and his one man show which is sorely incomparable.  The script, written by costar Darryn Lucio, is so contrived and poorly conceived that Van Der Beek never stood a chance.  He plays a screenwriter with severe psychological baggage and writer's block who locks himself in his apartment to focus on his latest screenplay, which involves a killer clown and revenge, and suicide, to boot.  The problem is the movie's pace is slow with redundant fadeouts and lots of silence, and never really grabs you with any kind of emotional value.  Van Der Beek tries hard but he's not given much to work with.  And Lucio's script is laced with an abundance of profanities which goes to show that mediocre screenwriters think a thousand F***s are so ""realistic"" wherein they only represent the writer's inability to create real situations and dialogues without throwing in a F*** in every other line.  A real loser, not even worth a rental folks.",1191715200,2,1073,4.741935483870968
2861210,1,B000R7HY2S,"It's hard to believe the actors thought this was brilliant work. I can just see several of them trying to put a different spin on this script to the director. If they did, He probably should have listened.

Final Draft is one of the most pointless films I have seen for some time. It completely misses any type of point it might have been trying to make and, worst of all, the ending will be more predictable than the sun rising tommorow.

I had hoped this might have been a darker, more horror version of Secret Window starring Johnny Depp, but this is more like watching someone struggle to pull a thum-tack out from the wall.

James Van Der Beek is given a role I can only assume no other actor would want...The idea of a One Man Show is normal a godsent to a actors, they get more screen time..less competition..but he is given worthless dialoge and too many ""What the hell was that flash-cutting effect?"" glances.

The rest of the ""Cast"" are simply not present enough to give any kind of impression, the same can be said for the Killer Clown(I am terrified of Clowns) But in this picture all I could do was think about how scary past killer clown movies have been.

In short, the Director of this film probably thinks he has made a  ""Miss-understood ArtHouse Horror film.......He hasn't, this is purely and simply a waste of everybody's time.

I strongly advise you to chose another film. This isn't scary..It isn't entertaing..It isn't clever. I actually can't tell you what it is.",1191110400,,1487,4.546816479400749
2861211,3,B000R7HY2S,"This is without a doubt the weirdest movie i've ever seen. When i first picked it up and looked at the cover i automatically thought (evil looking clownusually equals good horror movie) But this is kinda the opposite. I'm not saying this is a bad movie, just very hard to write about as it's so strange. A writer locks himself in his appartment to write a story about ""Punchy the Clown"" ( on the cover) A clown who he saw kill himself at a circus by accidently burning himself to death. From then on he begins to lose his mind. He starts talking to pictures of people he used to know and then he begins to see them as if they were really there. The people include. His ex wife, a sexy callender girl, a high school bully, and a former friend who stabbed him in the back when his brother died. One by one he types on his computer the fate of each and has the clown do the killings. I don't want to give too much more away, nor can i say i recommend this movie or not. Just don't expect to understand it.",1191110400,4,1002,4.11734693877551

8199302,2,B000R7HY2S,i think 'hate' is a tad strong for my score. 'didn't like it' says it all. for every reason.,1498608000,,92,3.8947368421052633
8199303,3,B000R7HY2S,"I'll admit that this was picked on a total whim because my wife and I were discussing how I had never seen an episode of Dawson's Creek.  During our conversation this movie popped up on the Amazon Prime horror selection and we took that as a sign.

The movie tells the tale of a writer, played by James Van Der Beek (Or the Beek as I call him) who is forced to write a screenplay by his only friend, who is actually a really selfish friend at all but a self centered actor who just wants another movie to be in.  The Beek has the idea that all suicides are the result of clowns, in this case Punchy, who are mad kids laugh at them.

The Beek forces his friend to lock him in his house so he can pound out a script in 2 weeks to meet a deadline his actor buddy gave him for a producers meeting.  For some reason I guess this producer won't accept any pitch that isn't accompanied with a fully fleshed out script, so the Beek has his work cut out for him.

Within a day or two of being locked in, our hero starts to hallucinate the clown and through visual and auditory hallucinations works through his relationship issues with his ex-wife, ex-friend, and his high school bully. Each of whom he has in depth internal conversations with before writing their suicide scenarios at the hands of Punchy.

These scenarios had a chance to be really unique but instead we get a hanging, bathtub electrocution, and the only interesting one a board of knives. So with all of his internal demons exercised and metaphorically put to rest our hero finishes his script just in time...hooray!

Well the script is finished by the time the actor buddy shows up to free the Beek and head to the meeting but for some reason our hero has decided to kill himself in the tub.  So the moral of this story is simple, work through your interpersonal demons and lay to bed your old regrets and anguish just so you can off yourself and let your crappy friend who forced you into this position in the first place walk out with your script.  Also, there is no indication his friend calls the police or anyone to come help.",1494288000,,2091,4.324808184143222

8199305,2,B000R7HY2S,"This was no different. The film wasn't so great to begin with. It wouldn't have minded blowing 90 minutes if it wasn't for the STUPID nonsensical very last scene

I gave it two stars because the lead really tried.  Plus I like movies where a person psychologically breaks down slowly, IF it's done right. I'm probably being too generous with two stars.

It's not horror. There's no murders. Not real ones at least.  Wasn't the worst I've seen around here but that's not saying a lot.",1484179200,,483,4.5813953488372094
8199306,3,B000R7HY2S,I was surprised James Van Der Beek has  a lot more range than I thought and the back story was interesting,1483401600,,106,4.0476190476190474
8199307,4,B000R7HY2S,loved it......slow burn as a man descends into madness....main character pulled this off extremely well,1483142400,,103,5.933333333333334
8199308,3,B000R7HY2S,"I can give it an okay, I can and feel good about it, too. I will admit to being a little bored at the start but then when I realized I was more or less watching someone have some kind of psychological meltdown (I think) I was able to look at it from a different perspective. I will say it was an interesting story for primarily a one man and sometimes 2 man and apparitions? show. I have always enjoyed James Van Der Beek a lot and I still do and I am so sad that he has never found that one role to push him into the light. The only other ""real"" character is his friend David played by the writer of this movie Darryn Lucio. he does a good job on both. This is one of those, you figure out type of movies and I won't really say which way I lean. did I love it, NO, did I hate it, NO. It really was one of those rock solid okay movies. Will I tell you to run out and get it, no I won't. If you see it somewhere on cable or on sale, no harm no foul.",1457654400,,948,3.7213930348258706
8199309,1,B000R7HY2S,"I never liked James Van Der Beek. I don't know why but I think it was because he was the bully in the film Angus. Considering I don't think I only saw the film once on tv and ten or more years ago, it stuck with me. Anyways, you can read the synposis of the movie. The acting is bad, the movie is slow paced, and just plain sucked. I wouldnt recommend anyone watch it.",1299110400,3,368,3.92
8199310,2,B000R7HY2S,"This movie was surprisingly dull. I kept waiting for something to happen, and it just never got up a good head of steam. I was going to say that it was overly long and could have used some more editing, but I see above that they list the running time as 90 min. I swear it felt like closer to 3 hours. It dragged and dragged. There were random scenes of weirdness, but it never launches itself into any sort of supernatural horror mode. Barely even qualifies as pschological drama. The jump edits and scene transitions were very jarring, I suppose to mimic the characters tenuous grasp on reality, but it just felt like poor editing. I know they were trying to do something different, a clown hitting people over the head with a bag of oranges and staging their deaths to look like suicide, but they should have worried more about making it interesting, not just different. The clown is a complete non entity. He's there, but only as interesting as a department store maniquin. I only give this an extra star because James Van Der Beek at least gives the material the old college try, there just isn't much to work with. This fell so flat it should probably only get one star, but I'll be kind.",1282780800,,1194,4.45662100456621
