3771170,3,B001QUXNTI,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 13 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes one hundred and sixty-four through one hundred and seventy-seven of Naruto.  The first disc contains four episodes, the second disc contains five episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  This set concludes the search for ""The Cursed Warrior""; Naruto, Sakura, and Choji help the owner of the ramen shop to rescue his daughter; Naruto, Ino, Shino, and Anko going on a mission to defeat an ocean demon; Naruto babysits a rich brat; Naruto, Hinata, and Kiba go on a treasure hunt; and Naruto and Jiraiya have a mail escapade.

The first extra is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of fifteen pages, which are model sketches of some of the Naruto characters.  There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 14, which runs for four minutes.  Next is ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode one hundred and seventy-three.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.

Next in the extras menu is a selection labeled ""New From Viz Media.""  This link takes you to advertisements for Shonen Jump Magazine, two Naruto pages, and two pages featuring other Shonen Jump manga titles.  A link in the extras menu labeled as ""DVD Trailers"" takes you to a set of trailers.  There are trailers for: Naruto the Movie: Guardians of the Crescent Moon Kingdom  (there is no audio if you are on the Japanese audio track; in order to hear it, you have to have the English audio track selected) and Bleach the Movie: Memories of Nobody.  The final link in the extras menu is labeled as ""Game Trailers,"" and it has trailers for: Naruto: Ultimate Ninja 3, Naruto: Ultimate Ninja Storm, Naruto: Clash of Ninja Revolution 2, Naruto: Path of the Ninja 2, and Naruto: The Broken Bond.

While I've come to expect these exact extras on the Naruto Uncut box sets, I still find this to be a little disappointing.  I wish Viz Media would go to a little more effort on the extras, so they're a little less predictable.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 13 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1282608000,,2410,4.591121495327103
3771171,3,B001QUXNTI,"This is a 'must' have, especially if you're a true Naruto fan. It's full of filler episodes, but if you love this series...they're worth it ;) You'll enjoy this item!",1272412800,,166,4.566666666666666
3771172,5,B001QUXNTI,"A lot of people are aggravated by the filler episodes before Shippuuden begins, but I find them entertaining and yes somewhat eye roll worthy at times. But that's okay because you know that once Shippuuden rolls around there won't be anymore filler episodes like these again. That's why I didn't mind them at all.",1252800000,3,313,4.814814814814815
3771173,3,B001QUXNTI,"The series isn't as good after season (box set)...10 i think, but still a great anime",1245974400,,85,4.375
3771174,5,B001QUXNTI,"If you're a fan of Naruto, you won't be disappointed with this box set.  Starting off with the goofy Ramen Making Episode, and ending with another fun one, this set is great from start to finish.

If you're not a fan, I'd recommend watching the first few episodes to see if you'd like it.

This one comes with another package of playing cards, contributing to a whole deck.",1241481600,2,373,4.455882352941177
