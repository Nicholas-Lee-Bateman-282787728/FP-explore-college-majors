8210482,5,B000TRS8E4,Love this lady and her humor!!,1485993600,,30,4.166666666666667
8210483,5,B000TRS8E4,I think this is hilarious but my kids aren't nearly as impressed as I am! :)  Good to see Anita has a grasp of the daily mundane grind a mom's job can be and still finds the humor in it all.,1327449600,,190,3.6341463414634148
8210484,5,B000TRS8E4,This proves it!  You CAN be funny without being offensive!  Great variety... stand up and music.  I'm going to have a girl's night at my home just so I can show this to my friends :),1270166400,,182,4.0
8210485,5,B000TRS8E4,Anita is fantastic!  I have seen her in person at a Women of Faith event; she did the Momisms (William Tell bit that is on YouTube)and we were almost on the floor laughing!  Her other comedy routines are just as funny!  When will this DVD be available??,1191974400,,253,4.340425531914893
8210486,5,B000TRS8E4,"OMG!!!  I saw a clip of this on U-Tube; it's hilarious & something every mom does or thinks.  I'm ready to buy this after seeing a short clip.  This DVD would be excellent for a ""girl's night out!""",1187827200,5,197,4.131578947368421
