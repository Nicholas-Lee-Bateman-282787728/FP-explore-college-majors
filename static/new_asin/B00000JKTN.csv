This movie was made I suspect to see if the series could be ressurected. I am afraid this movie falls short of even one of the series earlier episodes. Cannons old flames husband is murdered, and asks if Cannon will investigate. Ruled a suicide, Cannon has his doubts because the dead man was also a close friend of Cannon, and a retired CIA operative. Cannon thinks some of the victim's CIA ""Spook"" friends may be involved. Not a bad movie, but the killer was too easy to figure out for me. Since the movie didn't do well in the ratings, no more movies or series shows were ever done. Most fans like me will like it though.",1334793600,5,736,4.37956204379562
7912298,5,B00000JKTN,"This TV movie version of THE RETURN OF FRANK CANNON is only available on VHS.  I watched this movie on TV decades ago when it first appeared.  I was very surprised to see that it was still available on VHS. I am gratified that some copies still exist out there, and it is definately a great buy.  William Conrad's first and second series of the CANNON regular TV show are available on DVD through Amazon.  If you like this movie version you would love to buy and watch the two DVD series versions while they are still available!",1295568000,5,528,4.357142857142857
