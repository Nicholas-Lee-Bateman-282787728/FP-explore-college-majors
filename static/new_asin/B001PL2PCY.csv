8333675,5,B001PL2PCY,"I borrowed this video from a friend and took in on all my vacations but never used it. Finally in July I did it. And it snowballed - I did the video every single day, and have been doing it since. No joke, I am much more clear, and my thinking is not muddled anymore, even under stress. I'm not perfect, that's for sure, but I feel much more calm and centered. Coincidently, I am also much stronger than I was last month, and my neck and back rarely hurt anymore. WOW. I finally bought this video, and a few more of Gurutej's other videos too. On vacation I ended up doing 1.5 -2.5 hours of yoga each morning. Now I stick to atleast 45 minutes in the mornings and longer on the weekends. Even my 8 year old likes to join in at times. Gurutej is a great teacher on dvd  -I look forward to having a live class with her someday.",1376611200,8,825,4.061349693251533
