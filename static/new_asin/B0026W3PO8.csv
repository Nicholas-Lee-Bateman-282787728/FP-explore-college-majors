8353663,5,B0026W3PO8,This DVD is only available from the Stockyards Museum.  It was put together by the North Fort Worth Historical Society and it is EXCELLENT!  Home for me is Tarrant country where Fort Worth and the Stockyards are. I've been away for several years and seeing this film taught me so much about an area I took for granted when I was home.  This film answered so many questions and provided details I'd never considered.  I had no idea that the old Cowtown Coliseum (where we don't hold the big rodeos anymore) was where Theodore Roosevelt delivered a speech.  It is also where the first international musical superstar performed.  That was Enrico Caruso who sang there in the 1920's.  The Fort Worth Stockyards is more than a place where the cattle business exploded. It is a true gem.,1249257600,,781,4.656934306569343
