8494759,4,B00025DRJY,"This program was a good documentary on the A-10 because it documented the need, development and combat history of the A-10 very well. Though most of the content was dated. It is in color. There are interviews with the people who first conceived of an attack aircraft dedicated to destroying tanks on the battlefield. Also included, are interviews with engineers and pilots who flew the A-10. It covers the history and combat history of the aircraft well pointing out its usefulness on the modern battlefield. Even though the aircraft is now in the Air Force Reserves, I believe it is still a very effective attack aircraft for destroying tanks. I believe the aviation enthusiast and anyone who has flown the A-10 would love this program. I really would give this program 4.5 stars because it covers the A-10 very well but in my opinion some of the  content could have been more recent. That said, it is the only documentary I could find on this aircraft and is still a very good documentary on the A10!",1390953600,,1002,4.693181818181818
