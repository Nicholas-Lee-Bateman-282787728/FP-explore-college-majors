7805879,4,6300208788,"After years of a distinct memory of a serial seen only once, I finally located the title and was able to purchase it. I had a vision of the ""Copperhead"" leaping onto a moving car from a hill and low and behold it was a ""still"" on the box. While the acting was less than stellar and the story line full of holes, it still made ""Flash Gordon"" even more cheesy. It was a hoot to watch how two different endings to each cliff hanger were filmed. One for the end of the episode and a slightly different one for the beginning of the next. All in all it was fun and worth the hunt to find it again. Once I located the title, I have to agree with others who praised "" The Mysterious Doctor Satan"" as one of the best of a genre which was on it's way out.",1269820800,,745,3.9403973509933774

stable of stuntmen. Republic would often have him doing double duty playing

his own character and also doubling for other actors in the same film

Probably holds the honor of being in more films (albeit, often uncredited as a stuntman)

than any other person in Hollywood history. Sharpe's film/TV resume, if complete, would

likely total more than 5000 entries. Ranks with Yakima Canutt as Hollywood's premier stuntman.

of low-budget serials, Mascot merged in 1935 to form Republic,Witney teamed with director John English

on many of the era's best serials, most of them highlighted by kinetic fight and chase scenes that helped

change the face of action moviemaking...Witney became a director at 21, he was Hollywood's youngest.

5. John English (Director)

Date of birth: 25 June 1903 - Cumberland, England, UK

7805881,5,6300208788,"Others have said a lot about this classic...I want to point out the almost film noir mood of much of the serial, and a nicely ironic ending.  There was considerable thought put into this serial.  The only puzzling factor in it is the reference in the first chapter to the Copperhead's prior existence as an alter ego of the hero's father, but apparantly the character was not used in any other serial to the best of my knowledge.",985392000,,429,4.487179487179487
7805882,5,6300208788,"For Anyone looking for the Saturday Afternoon serial at it's Finest, Here it is. The Best Serial( I'll also allow The Adventures of Captain Marvel) by the only studio that really knew how to make them (Republic).Featuring the Best Stunts from the best stuntmen in the business, ""Dr Satan"" moves at a relentless pace for 15 thrilling chapters. Eduardo Cianelli( the memorable Thuggee priest in ""Gunga Din"") is the coolest villain in film history before Dr. Hannibal Lecter (same alma mater?). The Copperhead has to be the most practical hero in the business (No matter what he's wearing, all he has to do is put on the mask and tah dah). And it features the Debut of the Republic Robot!! What more do ya want??!! Side Note- I first saw this serial on ""Saturday Night at the Movies"" hosted by Elwy Yost, whose son Graham wrote a little number called ""Speed""...the central plot device of which is  very similar to something that happens in the first chapter of ""Dr Satan""...Coincidence? I think not...",984096000,8,998,4.76878612716763
7805883,4,6300208788,"Legend has it that this was going to be the first Superman serial, but negotiations between Republic and DC broke down (Columbia would later do two Superman serials, with cartoon flying sequences). So the villain,  clever enough to checkmate even the Man of Steel, was elevated to title  status and a hero of the Masked Marvel mode replaced him. The result is  still fine, with heroine Ella Neal retaining the ""Lois"" name and  secondary heroine Dorothy Hebert showing riding and stunting expertise that  makes you wish you saw more of her. After seeing Republic's outstanding  Captain Marvel serial, though, one wonders what Superman would be like with  the studios special effects experts.",959904000,9,690,5.107142857142857
7805884,3,6300208788,"Republic made the best serials particularly from 1939 to 1943 (their goden age) and this serial is one of their best. A bravura performance from Eduardo Cianelli, breakneck action, a rousing music score and top direction  from William Witney and John English make this a winner all the way. It's  too bad another superb serial from the same year--Drums of Fu Manchu--is  not available on commercial video. Rated solely against other serials I  give it 4 stars.",924566400,6,460,4.935064935064935
