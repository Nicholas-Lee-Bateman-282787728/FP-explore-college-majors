Within the first 5 minutes, a guy actually shoots his father in some diner in front of everyone simply because his dad spews some insults at his girlfriend. He's then shot by one the employers, which is then the beginning of a film that you might not be able to get through in one sitting. That sequence in the beginning has very little blood. After that, you'll have to wait until around the last 3 minutes of the movie before the credits roll up to see any more violence. The tame and virtually bloodless climax also offers no payoff to an extremely boring film. After that beginning scene in the diner, the film moves from one boring dialogue scene to the next; along with an occasional scattering, here and there, of boring and tame topless nudity and sex sequences until the lame climax finally ends it. Poorly written and directed with no atmosphere or interesting scenery, you watch boring dialogue scenes in a film that mostly takes place indoors. It has some good looking women in it, but this can't save it. There's also no suspense at all. The movie is about some guy getting involved with some crazy girl; I was bored and turned it off. I had to come back again and watch the rest and wasn't really paying attention because it was so uninvolving.

The quality has grain, but everything else looks very good. It has no chapter stops.

VOODOO DOLLS

This misleading title actually has only one scene with the dolls killing someone in a sequence that has some blood but isn't graphic; the dolls are barley even in the film. The movie is about some occultist who practices voodoo and uses black magic. Aside from that scene with the dolls, there's a beginning murder sequence that has some blood but isn't graphic. Then there's some blood with a girl cutting herself, and there's some blood spilling from a shower scene that has no nudity. There's also a ritual scene with the voodoo guy pulling out some insects, and the murder sequence at the end has some blood but nothing worth mentioning. Overall, the gore content is low and disappointing; the movie is not graphic. The film has some topless nudity and has mediocre or poor directing depending on your taste, and it lacks atmosphere, interesting scenery, and suspense. The directing can be described as very amateurish. I liked it because it has a certain low-budget type charm to it, but most people will find it to be dull and uninvolving; the movie needs more action because it'll feel really dull to some people. In between the exploitation, there's some talky parts and nothing really interesting happens. I gave the DVD 3 stars because of this film.

The quality has grain, but the transfer is very good. There's no chapter stops",1394668800,2,2708,4.680672268907563
