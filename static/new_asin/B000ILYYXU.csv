2658875,5,B000ILYYXU,This is an excellent story of how ordinary people risked their lives to help an American pilot.  The interviews with the people (and/or their descendents) were touching.  These people are still very appreciative of what Americans did for their country -- which is refreshing to see.,1162944000,,282,5.108695652173913
2658876,4,B000ILYYXU,"This is an amazing story to watch unfold.  The heroics that take place are so inspiring.  It makes me wonder, how many of us in our current lives would risk everything to help complete strangers?  Not just one stranger, but hundreds over a period of time. This film is very thoughtfully put together and is very well written.  The music is haunting at times and adds just the right touch. I thoroughly enjoyed it!",1162684800,,413,4.54054054054054
2658877,5,B000ILYYXU,"Wold War II is one of the single most documented events in world history and yet this film delivers an outstanding recount of a young American pilot who has been shot down over Nazi occupied Belgium. This event begins an amazing journey of a man who is aided and assisted by complete strangers, in a foreign country, rising up to battle a national force far greater than themselves.

While many filmmakers would have chosen to only tell the heroism of the pilot, viewers of this film are taken deep into the stories of several Belgium men and women who risked their lives, families and possessions to aid not only this allied pilot but scores of other pilots shot down over Belgium. The filmmakers build a rich tapestry of storytelling and weave a deep emotional connection for the viewer.

Dates, timelines and geography, while important to the film, serve as the backdrop to set the scene of what is one of the best, personal WW II documentaries to date.

Last Best Hope by nature compels the viewer to put aside preconceived notions and place themselves in the life of this allied pilot as well as the people that helped him out of compassion and hope. It offers a portrait of personal courage and freedom and provides a great reflection as to what community and service really means under the greatest of circumstances. It is a must see for documentary lovers as well as young people today that are far removed from this great generation.",1162252800,,1442,4.691699604743083
2658878,5,B000ILYYXU,This is a well researched and photographed reminder of how many people risked their lives to contribute in some way to defeat Nazi Germany.,1162252800,,139,4.833333333333333
2658879,5,B000ILYYXU,"Although I may be prejudiced because my dad was in the film, I cannot sing the praises of this film enough. This Greatest Generation is so humble - never wanting to call attention to themselves. Yet we all need constant reminders of how precious our freedom is, and what sacrifices these brave men and women made so that WE can live in a free country. I was moved to tears as I watched the film and tried to put myself in the place of the resistance volunteers - would I be as selfless? Everyone needs to view this film over and over again. Without the help of these tireless people, I wouldn't be here. I thank the Belgians for getting my daddy home!
I cannot thank David and Ramona enough for making this film. In telling the story about Bill Grosvenor, they were able to get my father's story for us. How ironic that two of these airmen who didn't know each other while in the prison and who escaped that same day from that train would end up living in the same city? Thank you from the bottom of my heart.
Beautiful score, meaningful film.",1162252800,,1043,4.326530612244898
2658880,5,B000ILYYXU,The Story of Mr Grosvenor and his experience was riveting. The lenghts that were gone to; to revisit the locations and find the people should be the hallmark for all future documentaries. Thank You Mr Grosvenor for your service and story.,1162252800,,238,4.829268292682927
2658881,5,B000ILYYXU,"My dad once said : when I retire I'm going to write a book.  And so he did !  Without that book there wouldn't be a movie.  I must say that it's astonishing how strong, sensetive and heartbreaking this movie has become. The story of Bill is one of the many stories of my country and the fact that my father wrote this book and became a part of this movie makes sure that I would do the same if I was born 65 years ago.  Of course, I hope my efforts will never be necessary.  This movie gives a very valuebale lesson in beeing an good person.

Thank you for that.

2658882,5,B000ILYYXU,"Since my father too was shot down during World War II and was saved by ""regular' people I have been looking forward to seeing Last Best Hope for a while.  It was even better than I had hoped it would be.  It is a powerful, compelling story; one that people of all ages need to see and to talk about together.",1162252800,,308,4.032786885245901
2658883,5,B000ILYYXU,"Belgium's contribution to the European resistance is scarcely remembered these days, yet the escape and evasion lines created there--such as Comete, founded by Andree De Jongh and Pat O'Leary, founded by Albert Guerisse-- played an important role in evacuating downed Allied Airmen across occupied Europe, through a grueling trek over the high Pyrenees, and back to their bases in Britain.  One such airman was Bill Grosvenor, who crashed in a field in Flanders.  Although Grosvenor was one of those who didn't make it safely back to Britain (though he did survive the war), the film revisits many of the venues of his wartime itinerary, and, more importantly, those members of the Belgian resistance who came to his rescue, including the two Dumon sisters, Andree Antoine Dumon and Micheline Ugeux Dumon.  Not to be missed.",1162252800,,824,5.134328358208955
2658884,5,B000ILYYXU,"I was privileged to see Last Best Hope at the Dallas Film and Video Festival. By documentary's end, there wasn't a dry eye in the house. The subject matter is so important - reminding us of what true heroism is. It is a story that needs to be seen, specially by today's young people. The way the material was developed and presented was also wonderful, allowing us to view the chronology of events with clarity and emotion. Kudos to writer/director Mat Hames for a riveting telling of an important story.",1162252800,,504,4.611111111111111
2658895,5,B000ILYYXU,"This was an excellent true story about sacrifice and bravery...not only of an American pilot, but also of those individuals who were willing to put their lives on the line to help those who were fighting for them. It should be mandatory for students at every high school in America.",1162252800,,282,4.66
2658896,5,B000ILYYXU,"""Last Best Hope"" is one of the greatest documentaries we've ever seen.  We highly recommend it to people of all ages.  Indeed it is a must-see story about hope, history, family, risk, connections, and love.""  Dr. Melody Chatelle and Mr. Edward Zamora, Austin TX",1162252800,,261,4.886363636363637
2658897,5,B000ILYYXU,This moving portrait of simple people who sacrificed everything to save the lives of American airmen during WWII is something to show your kids and grandkids. In this time people need reminders of what's important in life and how even one person can make a difference. LAST BEST HOPE is that kind of reminder.,1162252800,,309,4.7407407407407405
2658898,5,B000ILYYXU,"This was extrememly well done and quite personal to my family since I am the wife of Jack Terzian who was in the same Bastille with Bill Grosvenor in Brussels though they never met at the time.  Through the years, I had heard most of the story and certainly had heard much of how the brave Belgians had saved so many of our airmen.  We kept in contact for years with a number of the people and still have contact with the daughter of one of the ladies who worked tirelessly with the underground in Belgium.  Their strength and bravery should never be forgotten and as my daughter wrote to Mme Anne Brusselmans, my husband's guardian angel---""if it were not for you, I wouldn't be here.""  Congratulations on a job well done.",1162252800,,723,4.454545454545454
2658899,5,B000ILYYXU,"This brilliantly photographed film shows the courage of an American soldier and of the Belgian Resistance....a group of people who quietly risked their lives to do 'the right thing'.  Not only does it delve into the logistics of who did what where, but it takes us into the minds and hearts of both the soldier who dropped from the sky and the brave and kind people who risked their lives to save him. This riveting story shows us the horror of war softened by heartwarming acts of heroism.  Last Best Hope is a beautifully shot film that is a thriller as well as a history lesson.",1162252800,,581,4.471698113207547
2658900,5,B000ILYYXU,"This movie is one that people of any age and interest level in history should definitly watch.  It is an amazing story of ordinary people who become heros, most of which are under the age of 30.  Young people these days need to learn what freedom really means and what it takes to protect your freedom.",1162252800,,302,4.375
8146121,5,B000ILYYXU,Excellent story - actually made me enjoy history and I have never enjoyed history.  We got it because it was a friends great uncle's story - so glad we watched.  I have actually bought some for gifts for my history loving friends.,1525305600,,230,4.4523809523809526
8146122,5,B000ILYYXU,Nice to hear an account of survival of these courageous men and women.,1512000000,,70,4.461538461538462

8146125,5,B000ILYYXU,"This is an outstanding, inspiring documentary that works on two levels. In telling the true hair-raising story of an American airman shot down over Belgium during WWII, it also describes the network of extraordinary men and women who operated the underground network that helped the fliers escape. These heroes weren't flashy Hollywood types, but average folks who risked their lives and families to rescue the men they firmly believed were fighting for their freedom. When discovered by the Germans, they were tortured and imprisoned; many of them did not survive the war. The interviews with a few survivors and their children as well as with the airman are harrowing; the pain and horror of those times still shadow their lives more than 60 years later. While the Belgian underground was the ""last best hope"" for the desperate airmen, the airmen were, of course, the ""last best hope"" for the occupied people. Their joint legacy is one of incredible courage and honor. Like other reviewers, I shed tears watching this program. It was chilling, humbling and inspiring.",1291420800,,1069,5.079545454545454
8146126,4,B000ILYYXU,"Produced by the downed airman's own son this moving documentary follows him back to where he was shot down in occupied Belgium during WW2. I had previously know about the Belgian resistance and escape ""lines"" through watching the 1970s BBC series ""Secret Army"". Last Best Hope provided a great deal of extra detail about how Allied airman were brought to freedom by ordinary people and of course gives us the opportunity to hear first-hand through their own eyewitness accounts. Highly recommended.",1258329600,,498,5.160493827160494
8146127,5,B000ILYYXU,"This is a fantastic investment in time.  Powerful story that was more than 60 years in the making, brilliantly told and a must for anyone even with a casual interest in the history of the Greatest Generation.",1252368000,,208,4.621621621621622
8146128,5,B000ILYYXU,"My first exposure to the incredible story of the Comet Line in WW2 was in Douglas W Jacobson's extraordinary novel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Night-of-Flames-A-Novel-of-World-War-II/dp/1590131363/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Night of Flames: A Novel of World War II</a>. This organization, founded in 1941 by a 24 year old nurse in Brussels was eventually responsible for the rescue and safe passage of more than 800 Allied aviators shot down over occupied Belgium, Holland and France. Under the most dangerous conditions imaginable these ordinary people - most of them young women - put their lives on the line to rescue young American and British aviators at extreme peril. So extreme, in fact, that for every aviator rescued one Comet Line agent was arrested and imprisoned by the Gestapo. Now in LAST BEST HOPE, this truly inspiring story is available to all of us in a well crafted, gripping video. Do yourself a favor and buy this video, watch it and you will never forget it!",1204329600,,1029,5.602564102564102
8146129,5,B000ILYYXU,"A riveting story of true-life heroism among ordinary people.  The emotional interviews with the actual participants are quite moving, and are skillfully edited together with historical material.  There is not a hint of the preachiness or speechifying that mars so many documentaries, nor is there any trace of sentimentality.  Instead, the viewer is simply pulled into the tale of brave men and women helping others at the risk of their own lives.  An inspiring film.",1168041600,,467,5.1866666666666665
8146130,5,B000ILYYXU,"My eyes were glued to the TV watching this, every picture was so touching, every story was so moving.  I was surprised how many young girls in particular risked their lives to save Allied airmen.  The interviews are so moving, and the film really gives a sense of what their efforts cost these courageous people.  Each survivor was so bright, so full of life, I wondered if this personality had allowed them to resist the Nazis, or if the experience of doing so is what changed them into such vibrant people.  I am so glad that documentaries like this are being made while the survivors are still alive.  And I am incredibly grateful to all of them.",1164326400,,649,4.512820512820513
