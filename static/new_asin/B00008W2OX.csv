1862796,3,B00008W2OX,"With an admiration bordering on reverence, RFK is a made-for-television movie that tracks Robert Kennedy's career from November, 1963 to his own death by assassination in June, 1968.  British actor Linus Roache plays Robert F. Kennedy and James Cromwell plays RFK nemesis and, coincidentally President of the United States, Lyndon B. Johnson.

 Roache has the hair, the accent, and enough of the charisma to make a convincing RFK.  Missing is the sense of the spiritual growth RFK underwent in the five years following his brother's assassination.  It's mentioned, of course.  At one point Kennedy, after recounting some incidents in his ruthless past, asks an aide ""Do you really think I've changed?""  Unfortunately, the aide's affirmation stands in stead of the movie showing us the change.  Rather, writer Hank Steinberg and director Robert Dornhelm insert the shade of John F. Kennedy (Martin Donovan) into the story, and make him a character who pops in and out throughout the movie to chide, goad, and advise his younger brother.  It's a device the story doesn't need.  The facts were rich enough in themselves, and the JFK ghost just distracts and pulls us out of the story as well as cause us to question RFK's sanity.  Still, from carpeting-bagging senatorial candidate to spearheading a program to rebuild slum neighborhoods in New York City, from meeting with union activist Cesar Chavez to addressing an anti-apartheid crowd in South Africa to a campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination on an anti-war platform, RFK does hit most of the major points of Kennedy's career post 1963.

 RFK is an okay if somewhat spotty and superficial political biopic.  Towards the end of his life Robert Kennedy had indeed changed, and his growth from ruthless detachment to compassionate liberalism is one of the strangest political odysseys in American political history.  If this movie sparks an interest in the runt of the Kennedy clan (it should,) and a trip to the bookshelf to check out a biography (Evan Thomas's Robert Kennedy: His Life is a good place to start,) it's good enough for me to recommend.",1124064000,15,2116,5.07514450867052
1862797,4,B00008W2OX,"A well acted, accurate biopic of Bobby Kennedy following the assassination of his brother, John right up to his own assassination a few years later.

1862798,5,B00008W2OX,"I am a Linus Roache fan.  He really proves that he earns his fan base in this one as well.

This movie adds real period film footage to add to the grip of the topic of the flick.  It deals with Robert's battle to prove himself worthy as his brother President Kennedy.  Too bad for the nation he never had his chance to serve as his brother did.  I also appreciated the repentence to the war in Vietnam, (I hope we look to the past to learn a lesson about Iraq).  It dabbled in his personal life just to add reality.  I am a hopeful that one day Martin Luthur King's, and The Kennedy's will be a reality.  If not I fear another societal collapse.  We still have people living in poverty like the movie deals with greatly.

Our Pledge says, ""...and justice for all.""  This nation still falls very short of our founding fathers dream of equality.

Robert Kennedy was a great man.  On a more personal note it will stir any sibling trying to crawl from anothers.  I wish Robert Kennedy were with us today.  One day people of all colors, all faiths, all nations, straight/gay will be equal.  I only hope God will let this happen before we have a meltdown.

Please get this movie, it will stir your passion for Robert Kennedy, and our nation.  We are in Iraq fighting a war for Democratic ways, so they tell us.  Please, think while watching this movie what kind of face does our country really want the world to see.  Are we a nation of, ""...do as I say, not as I do!""

To sum it up any fan of The Kennedy's, or Mr. Linus Roache will appreciate this Fox offering.",1100563200,7,1557,4.2457337883959045
1862799,5,B00008W2OX,"In this screenplay, we see a man so haunted by the (presumably preventable) spectere of his older brother's death that he litterally becomes a whole new person in the aftermath.

The young communist inquisitor who once was friends with Wisconsin Republican Senator Joseph McCarthy (as was JFK)consequently became the devout champion of the underclass. Whether it was minorities, the poor, students or some other group, the 'new' Bobby was sincerely committed to ensuring everybody could (and did) participate in the American dream.

What makes this transformation all the more magical is that a campaign consultant did not make the suggestion (and given how little some of these groups could financially contribute while their association simmutaeneously could have caused big political stigmatization, perhaps attempted to talk him out of these very same actions). It is to RFK's credit that he ultimately stood his own ground and took the road much less traveled in American politics.

Because I came of age in the post-watergate generation, I am accustomed to candidates (regardless of political ideology and/or party) appearing replete with slick demeanor's. The rattling of RFK's psyche following Dallas 1963 ultimately produced a folksy demeanor that even Jimmy Carter ultimately had failed to replicate during his presidential candidate and presidency.

If his own fate were different, Kennedy easily would have become the 20th century's second most influential president---immediately after fellow Democrat Franklin Delano Roosevelt.",1098748800,18,1541,5.658008658008658
1862800,5,B00008W2OX,"RFK is a good movie.
the music is good, the story line, and the actors are all awsome.
Mr. Roache played a very good and very convincing Bobby Kennedy who is at a crossroads with the death of his brother, Jack Kennedy.

the movie shows just how distrought Bobby really was and still how much the death of his brother bothered him. The film implies to a good extent that Bobby did in fact feel responsible for his brother's death, and the spirit of JFK tells Bobby that.

I like the views from the spirit of JFK, who only Bobby can see, because it makes Bobby that much more human.  He wanted to do good things, he really did. He sought another view, possibly putting an end to the war in Vietnam, he sought to help out poor people, minorities, and fought for values more than for votes.

Bobby really turned over a leaf from attack dog as Attorney General to a really good man who wanted to do good things, but a bullet ended that dream.  The ending speech and the train ride footage ends the movie perfectly cause it feels like a metaphor for the life of Bobby Kennedy.  He touched and moved so many people in his short 42 years of life, and still today inspires a whole new generation.

great movie on Bobby Kennedy, i only wish there was special features like commentary and stuff like that.",1096934400,26,1294,4.344398340248962
1862801,2,B00008W2OX,"I was hoping for much better from this production.  But based on the fact that nobody else in the world has seen it, I should have known better.  I thought the movie was so bad, I could not finish.
The writers have chosen to rewrite history in many ways.  First, RFK apparently had schizophrenia because his reality was very distorted.  JFK kept appearing to RFK throughout the movie.  The most interesting thing is that RFK only speaks in a Massachusetts accent to his brother (or brother's illusion). As if distorting reality is not enough of a crime, the movie accuses Lyndon Johnson and the CIA of killing John Kennedy.
Read a book on this fallen Catholic leader.  Do not rely on this travesty as a source.",1072915200,5,710,4.595238095238095
1862802,5,B00008W2OX,"I first caught this movie on FX when it premiered, and I hoped that more people will see it now that it's on DVD. The movie is concerned with Bobby Kennedy's evolution after his brother's death in 1963, and Linus Roache does a convincing job of playing the late man (He and the actor who played RFK in Thirteen Days are the two best I've seen at this difficult acting job). Being something of a RFK buff, I found this film moving and worth watching. In this time of politicians who cater to the lowest common denominator (on both sides of the aisle), we need to look back on men like Bobby Kennedy, who genuinely cared about the underdogs of American society and was killed in the midst of his greatest act of compassion. One of these days, people will recognize RFK as the best man who was never elected President. This movie is a good start for anyone wondering ""what all the fuss was about"". I recommend it",1069545600,50,909,4.384615384615385
1862803,4,B00008W2OX,"This movie is about RFK's life without JFK.  Mostly throughout his political career RFK did what was in the best interest of his brother and not himself.  He played the cruel, conniving younger brother. However, after November 22, 1963, all that changed. He no longer had anyone to protect and now he had a chance to be himself.  This film magnificently shows the ""real"" Bobby.  Not ruthless and devious, but brave and honest. A man who ""could get things done."" It also shows a sad and tormented Bobby.  A man so devestated by his brother's death that he sees visions of him, all the way up to his own assassination.  Linus Roache and James Cromwell do a great job portraying RFK and LBJ respectively. Minor characters like Ethel and Ted Kennedy don't seem to be the Kennedys America's come to know, but overall the casting is good and so is the movie.",1063843200,17,852,4.572368421052632

I also didn't care for the negative voice over of his slain brother throughout the movie.  I think RFK was haunted by guilt of his brother's death, wondering if his press against the mafia etc, spurred it to happen; however, the movie doesn't use it in this way.  It's very overused.",1466553600,,452,4.2823529411764705

If you have ever seen footage of him with his children it is obvious that he had a playfulness and a tenderness that was integral to who he was. On what would have been his 89th birthday today I like to remember him not just as a political figure but as a father, husband and a man that he was. I like Linus Roache but the screenplay limited what he was able to do.",1416441600,,499,3.9504950495049505
1862816,5,B00008W2OX,Wonderful acting by Linus Roache.  He looks and sounds like Robert Kennedy and he did a tremendous job portraying him.,1409011200,,118,4.9
1862817,5,B00008W2OX,"The Amazon reviews of RFK motivated me to acquire this movie and see for myself. Given it is a made-for-TV movie, I wasn't sure what to expect.

Linus Roache's performance as RFK was spot on. Everything from his body posture to the cadence of his speech captured the essence of the man. James Cromwell, who never seems to give a bad performance, was excellent as LBJ, right down to the way Lyndon would tower over people and quite literally get in their faces.

People either seemed to love Robert Kennedy or loathe him. Accusations that his motivations for running for president were base and utterly self-serving would appear to be at odds with those who relay that he underwent a profound emotional and psychological change after the assassination of JFK in November 1963. There's no doubt that, in the service of his brother's political ambitions, RFK was ruthless, an ""attack dog"" as RFK calls himself in the film.

The ""conversations"" that RFK has with his slain brother in the movie is a useful narrative technique in addressing the guilt and recriminations and identity questions that RFK must have had after his brother was murdered.

Yes, Robert Kennedy worked for and with Joe McCarthy, tapped Martin Luther King's phone., went out of his way to publicly bash and humiliate members of organized crime and labor leaders, was involved in attempts to kill Fidel Castro, and was instrumental in backing JFK's decisions regarding Vietnam. The movie addresses his past actions and decisions, and shows how he wrestled with what he had done in his brother's service. Lots of people did loathe him.

The transformation he underwent after Dallas, the ocean-depths of despair and mourning and self-questioning are all looked at in this film, which, as one reviewer noted, manages to skirt the Hallmark quality of many such films.

If you are favorably disposed towards Robert Kennedy, this film will will most likely cement and add to those feelings. If you feel he was a ruthless opportunist seeking to become president because it somehow belonged to the Kennedy family, you're probably not going to be swayed in that perspective. As a film, a movie made for television, I think it reveals the story of a man having to determine who he was and what he stood for after stepping out from the shadow of his brother. In telling that story, this movie does much better than most.",1400198400,,2376,4.868811881188119
1862818,4,B00008W2OX,A fairly good look at Robert Kennedy without the foibles.  Why isn't Linus Roache cast in more movies?  He is a gifted actor and not seen enough.,1397088000,,145,4.333333333333333
1862819,5,B00008W2OX,"I'm not saying that RFK was the most innocent politician that ever walked this earth, but this movie at least portrays his humanity. The fact that he came out against the Vietnam war, which the good ol' USA lost by the way, and he gave his life trying to turn things around portrays a tremendous amount of courage. Of course, before Bobby lost his life, his two brothers gave their lives for this country! In light of what is taking place today in the way of ""ASSASSIN'S INSANITY"" it has become very clear that the evil ones have captured the positions of extreme power all over the world. I thought James Cromwell did an excellent job playing the role of LBJ, and Linus Roache was the perfect actor to play RFK. I tried to donate a copy of this to our local library because there are no copies anywhere in our system, but for some reason they would not take it. The lady who handles the donated DVDs, no doubt, is not a fan of the Kennedy Family. Certain information critical of the ""EMPIRE"" is not to be tolerated in our ""PUBLIC"" libraries. Pretty soon, individuals that have the audacity to attempt to reach the public sector with ""TRUTH"" will receive the same treatment as Abraham Lincoln, JFK, RFK, MLK, Jr., Ronald Reagan (who was his V.P.?!), Malcolm X, Philip Marshall, and on and on and on......

I made a horrible mistake and checked out the DVD ""BEYOND BORDERS"" on 5-5-14 from my library because Linus Roache was in it. What a horrible contrast to the excellent portrayal of Linus Roache in ""RFK.""

However, it is very distracting to have the ghost  of JFK popping up all the time having conversations with him.  I think adding this was a big mistake.  The movie certainly gives a good picture of how RFK became so interested in the poor of this country and how it affected him. I think there should have been something in it about the man who shot him. I was an adult at the time of the shooting and I don't remember there ever being any release of his statements as to why he shot him.

""All of us might wish at times that we lived in a more tranquil world, but we don't. And if our times are difficult and perplexing, so are they challenging and filled with opportunity.""  Robert Kennedy said this nearly five decades ago and it is just as relevant today.  The quality of leadership he portrayed was seeing problems as opportunities to correct the evils of the world.  He was courageous.  He did not have to pursue the causes of civil and human rights, of correcting century old wrongs in society.  This movie portrays him well and brings out his ideals and ideas.  I use it in my course on leadership since it exhibits so many qualities we need today and referenced it in  my latest book, Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times.

It explores historic leadership qualities and challenges. It delves into the lives of Julius Caesar, Augustus, Napoleon, Lincoln, Martin Luther King, Eleanor Roosevelt, Margaret Thatcher and Oprah Winfrey to reveal their Leadership Secrets, Leadership Traits, Achievements, and Words of Wisdom to create a modern day compass for leaders of all ages, all industries and fields and all forms of leadership.

My next book will also explore the qualities of JFK and RFK.  This movie goes hand in hand with Profiles in Leadership from Caesar to Modern Times and I recommend it to anyone wanting to understand leaders who fight for the right cause, even if it is not the right time as Robert Kennedy often did.",1381536000,,1680,5.398467432950191

In other words, the people behind this film didn't change history or add extra stuff into the movie for dramatic effect. It's a movie and it tells a story without veering off course into fiction.

Actually, it's pretty good because it rises above the 'Hallmark'-style drama as it progresses and offers an unusually thoughtful portrayal of Robert Kennedy. They take trouble to explore RFK's mental agonies after his brother's assassination, his awakening sense of responsibility towards those in society who are vulnerable and his indecision over whether to challenge LBJ in 1968.
Admittedly, the 'phantom JFK' scenes are a bit over-the-top, but I can understand the film-makers were trying to give voice to Bobby's inner doubts. Who decided to cast Linus Roache in the title role? Inspired idea, whoever it was - he gives a superb performance. The voice isn't quite there, but it's good enough. Of the various actors I have seen play the role, Roache gives the 'deepest' version so far. Watching this film (and reading about RFK) makes you wonder what went wrong in US politics after the 1960s. How many politicians today would even KNOW Aeschylus, let alone be able to QUOTE him to an audience? Deliver us from the plastic, grinning, spin-savvy morons of today!
