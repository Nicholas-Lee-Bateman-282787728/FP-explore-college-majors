The Danger Rangers are celebrating Fire Saftey Month with their Fire Saftey house in Chicago at Navy pier where they're teaching kids all about what to do if there is a fire. But not everyone is listening, Scott a bear and Derek a fox my two favorite minor characters in the show are bored and then Derek foolishly decides to call in a false alarm despite Scott telling him not to.
Then a box of fireworks falls out of a truck and Derek decides foolishly again to steal them.

So he and Scott head back to his apartment and start a fire! Oh Derek where in the world is your brain?
 But Ranger Sully and Kitty save them and they find out not only did Derek start the fire by playing with the fireworks but also called in the false alarm. He and Scott go to court and are sentenced to 6 months of community service and they start by apologizing to chief Daniels the fire chief who is a dog and help clean up the fire trucks. Then they take a fire Saftey test at the Fire Saftey house which they ace and they learned the hard way but have truly learned their lesson.

Great episode! I wish there was another episode that starred Derek and Scott or better yet a spin-off series! And they were older too! If they were they would be incredibly handsome! Scott was voiced by Michael Reisz best known as Matt from Digimon Digital Monsters! Derek was voiced by Justin Cowden.",1348617600,2,1435,4.284132841328414

 and I like the fact that it is a teaching for my grandchildren that
 will help them to have good moral values and teach them things
 that they should avoid doing.

 Thank you,

He is currently fascinated by ""good guys and bad guys,"" law enforcement, etc. and these DVDs fulfill that curiosity for him, while teaching him valuable lessons about fire and other dangerous things.  The DVDs hold his attention and he gets excited about watching them.",1168819200,4,338,4.711864406779661
