8029609,5,B0002NRRW4,"In the U/K This DVD costs a monstrous 52 and counting. Why are these IMAGE ENTERTAINMENT DVDs so expensive...but so good. This one, ""Silver Canyon"" is one of my favourite Autrys. From his later (1951) Columbia period, it is full of action, well directed as ever by John English. Hefty fist fights, Gun fights, chases, only 3 songs, and Pat Buttram is (almost) bearable!. It also has a good plot, script and cast. Gail Davis is always watchable, and Bob Steele, Terry Frost, Dick Alexander, Edgar Dearing, Kenne Duncan all show up well (as they always do). My personal disapointment is Jim Davis. Normally I think he is one of the great Heavies, and leading Cowboy star in his later years (Istill think he stole ""The Big Sky""). Here he really isn't given much to do or say, and what he does say is in a sort of monotone as tho he really didn't wanr to be there - Maybe he didn't! Anyway I feel any of Autry's ""Dress"" Heavies could have played the part. That's enough rambling about Jim. It is still a good example of just how professional and entertaining Autry and his team could be, and again, the Image DVD is excellent quality. There are some extras for those who like them and if you get a ""Used-Good as new"" as I did at a cheaper price ($17 plus postage), it's well worth it. Highly recomended.",1369267200,,1299,4.439330543933054

8029611,5,B0002NRRW4,"This movie uses the name of McQuarrie(actor Jim Davis) as the guerilla raider who leads a gang of deserters as they raid and loot army caravans and towns.  They marauder and destroy these towns and murder the people who resist.  Scouts for the overland stage Gene Autry and side kick Pat Buttram are called into to stop the looting and killing.  This movie also stars Bob Steele and Gail Davis who assist in the effort.  Steele at first is deceived by McQuarrie but ends up being the hero in the end when he finds out how wrong he was.  Good look into the past history, one of Mr. Autry's more informative and historial westerns.  5 stars for the history buffs like myself!!",1105056000,8,674,4.483606557377049
