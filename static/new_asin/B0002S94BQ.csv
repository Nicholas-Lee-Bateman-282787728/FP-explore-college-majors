2116716,5,B0002S94BQ,"5IVE DAYS TO MIDNIGHT is one of my favorite TV miniseries.  Like ROOTS or HOLOCAUST it is best seen on TV, with the days spread apart, so that you can build up some excitement about seeing the next part, but on DVD you can kind of glom everything together; indeed you don't even have to watch the show in order--*though I would highly advise it.*  If you don't, the story is too confusing.

On SciFi you'd be watching ""Monday's"" episode on a Monday; it was cleverly done and you couldn't wait till Tuesday!  Tim Hutton isn't my favorite actor, but he did a fine job in this as the doomed professor.  And fun to see him with Kari Matchett as the two co-stars of NERO WOLFE are matchless together.  Watching Hutton break into the briefcase and find his obituary was chilling and you wanted to think that there must be some mistake, some loophole, some way in which he could survive the next five days.  I was thinking, well, he has the same name as his daughter (I mean the same initials, her name is Jesse) maybe the daughter is the one who is going to die?  She was only ten or so, but because the story is all about time travel it was easy to think, maybe she grew up and became a professor like her dad?  And that is whom the briefcase was addressed to!  The one in the car from PULP FICTION!  The show also references the murder of Nicole Brown Simpson, which also occurred ten years prior to the events of 5IVE DAYS TO MIDNIGHT, making you think a little bit, your restless brain searching for some solution, some tie up, of history's loose threads.

In a way the briefcase reminded me of the famous attache case in PULP FICTION, said to contain someone's soul-remember that?  Ten years ago, so right around the birth of little Jesse?  Lovely Nicole De Boer is in the movie too, from CUBE, and STAR TREK ENTERPRISE, she's a regular SciFi channel regular.  You may not know who she is from her name, but once you see her face it's an assurance that the quality science fiction product you are watching was filmed in Canada.

Randy Quaid is pretty good, although I found myself wondering why the producers couldn't have found someone who mumbled less.  I could barely make out what he was saying half the time as ""Irwin"" launched into one topic after another.  He was pretty much the most important character in the story, too, as the man charged with figuring out the solution to the homicide.  If you've seen the classic noir thriller D.O.A., with Edmond O'Brien, you've already anticipated much of what is interesting about this miniseries.  Remade later in the 1980s with Dennis Quaid, Randy's brother, as the dead man walking, D.O.A. similarly opened with a man reading his own death sentence.",1126828800,7,2700,4.516460905349795
2116717,4,B0002S94BQ,"I've just watched this in the UK where it was shown on 2 nights and totalled 4 hours.  I don't know if it was cut at all, or maybe in the US with more commercials, it would last 5 hours.  I have been a fan of Timothy Hutton for 20 years and he is the reason I began watching it, but thought it was a well-paced and interesting thriller.  Yes, the ending was a bit cheesy and I still want to know who would have been JT's original murderer - and why, but otherwise thoroughly enjoyed it.  I particularly liked the fact that the time-travel aspect was wholly incidental  - although like most, I guessed who sent the briefcase - and it was the thriller element that came to the fore.",1119225600,6,680,4.1603053435114505
2116718,4,B0002S94BQ,"We all know we're going to die. It's just that J. T. Neumeyer (Timothy Hutton) knows exactly the time and place of his death. Neumeyer teaches college physics. When he and his daughter Jessie visit the grave of J.T.'s wife and Jessie's mom, a strange thing happens; a futuristic brief case with J.T.'s name on it appears out of nowhere. Inside J.T. finds a case file that appears to be quite old. It's about an unsolved murder. J.T.'s murder and he has five days to find out who wants to kill him and why.

This Sci-Fi Channel original mini-series has a lot going for it; Hutton, Randy Quaid both give solid performances as does Kari Matchett. The only actors truly wasted are Giancarlo Esposito and Nicole de Boer. This TV mini-series seemed to stretch things out a bit too long. It would have worked much better as a two hour or two and a half hour TV movie. Director Michael W. Watkins uses a number of annoyingly over used techinques to create additional suspense (such as slow motion and shooting scenes at a higher speed or eliminating frames to make the motion appear choppy).

A solid TV mini-series that would have worked better if it was cut down to two hours vs. nearly four, ""5ive Days to Midnight"" is still worthwhile. Although there were some fairly large plot holes, they weren't as noticeable until the pacing slowed down around the third hour. Worth a rental at least.",1114819200,63,1385,4.603238866396761
2116719,3,B0002S94BQ,"I thought that I had a better review for this mini-series, but it looks like I may have shut it away in the trash vault.  So, for just this one I am going to give you the short, short version of what I witnessed.  5ive Days to Midnight was one of those classic mini-series that probably did very well while on television in keeping the suspense high and the anticipation even higher, but when it transferred onto DVD it didn't succeed as well.  When one has the opportunity to watch this series from beginning to end within the course of one day, the excitement and momentum slowly decreases.  Let me be more exact.

The first three episodes were great.  It was this beautifully mixed bag of drama and sci-fi that I know the Sci-Fi channel has a firm grip on.  It kept me guessing and wondering what would happen next.  I couldn't quite figure out exactly how all the pieces were going to fit together and it was enjoyable, then you put the second disc in and watch the final two episodes and everything going for this film goes down the toilet.  The final two episodes are nothing but filler and the ironically planned confusing ending.  I felt that these final two episodes just did not react well with the first three, there seemed to be something genuinely missing from all of this.  It was as if the creators had the horse running at full speed at first, then allowed it to gallop into the final lap.  It lost momentum, speed, and thrill when the second disc hit my DVD player.

The acting was decent with Quaid proving why the ""TV"" niche is his best friend.  Hutton could have done a bit better, portraying this struggling victim to this predestined crime, but instead I think he realized this was ""television"" and went with some sub-par skills.  While the acting was just average all around, I was o.k. with that, it was the story that I was hoping to get most of my strength from.  Sadly, the story was good, but not great.  There were huge, gaping plot holes that just were never covered or corrected.  When you are doing a time traveling film like this, you need this to make a coherent statement.  It is like writing a paper without using any punctuation, you don't know where to stop or end and it ends up a jumbled mess.  That is what happened with the final two episodes, the jumbled mess caught up to the creators and there was only one way to stop it ... clichs and unoriginality.

Overall, I was impressed to begin this series, but by the end, I had lost it completely.  The fourth day is nothing but filler, and that set the mood well off for the final day.  What began as this very interesting time travel drama/murder/mystery eventually turned into a regular program that you could find on any station. Something happened, and as we the viewers may never know, those involved do.  I suggest to everyone checking out the first disc while leaving the second behind.  If you need to know how it ends, forget about it.  The first three days will leave a better taste in your mouth than the final two days, and overall you will feel better (even if you don't know how it ends!)

Grade: *** out of *****",1111017600,7,3117,4.4323374340949035
2116720,5,B0002S94BQ,"This thrilling mini-series takes off like a rocket from the very beginning, as physics professor J.T. Neumeyer wonders how and why he received a police file apparently from the future that contains gruesome details of his own demise. According to this strange file locked inside a futuristic briefcase made of myserious materials, he has just five days before his murder to figure out what's going on. The suspense increases as little by little, Neumeyer discovers that this may not be a clever hoax, but that his very life may depend on solving and somehow preventing his murder in a very short amount of time. And with such an unusual situation, it's a challenge to know who will believe him, and who to trust. Timothy Hutton and Randy Quaid and the rest of the case are excellent in this suspenseful science fiction thriller that keeps us on the edge of our seats through all 255 minutes.",1110153600,139,891,4.754838709677419
2116721,4,B0002S94BQ,"I have no idea what the confusion is.  There are basically 5 days to the plot, unfolding sequentially with a title plate to mark each new day.  It aired on Cable in two parts of about 1h 30min each.  You can watch it straight through on DVD.  The story is compelling, piques your curiosity, sorta like '24', but the sci-fi premise is background to a good psychological thriller.

The story is about a Physics professor, Dr. J.T. Neurameyer (Timothy Hutton), who mysteriously finds a briefcase at his dead wife's grave with ""Dr J.T. Neurameyer"" on it (his little daughter also has these initials), which has appeared out of a rent in the fabric of spacetime, from the future, and contains a police file on his murder 5 days from now, by gunshot square in the head, with other cuttings of events taking place.

He sets out to investigate, try and change the course of events and rescue people from events that are slated to take place, and he succeeds after a fashion, but altering events brings with it a whole new unpredictable set of consequences, for good or bad, which no one is quite sure of.  Compelling, from beginning to end.  The characters surely have free will and the ability to change their destiny.",1104796800,6,1211,4.626168224299065

2116725,5,B0002S94BQ,"I watched ""Five Days to Midnight"" on the SciFi channel on June 7, 2004, through the 10th, and I loved it! J.T. Neumeyer, a high school professor, discovers a briefcase with his name on it. He soon finds out how to open it, and in it he discovers evidence of his own murder. At first he thinks it is a joke, but soon realizes that it is true, so he goes on an investigation to stop his own murder before it is too late. Each part of the story actually takes place on the day the part was on (on TV), so you know, that every night you watch a new part, he has one less day to figure it all out. I enjoyed the miniseries and wouldn't mind watching it all again. I am goeing to buy this DVD. If you missed ""Five Days to Midnight"" on June 7th, I would highly recommend you buy it. Even if you did see it, like I did, you should buy it.

2116749,4,B0002S94BQ,"Professor J.T. Neumeyer (Timothy Hutton) and his daughter have never fully recovered from the loss of their wife/mother, but try to live a simple life of solitude in suburban Seattle. After 10 years, J.T. is finally seeing a women, who he really likes, and things seem to be going good for the family, until a mysterious briefcase shows up. J.T. opens the case only to find an old police report, dated five days in the future. The file is an unsolved murder case in which the victim is Professor J.T. Neumeyer.

5ive Days To Midnight was a very unique and entertaining story, but for some reason, it was given to the SyFy channel and turned into a four part mini-series, rather than a movie. It's problematic, because to fill the extra time, they have to come up with a lot of side stories that never fully resolve themselves. Sometimes with Science Fiction, things are never resolved, because they simply can't be explained and I'm okay with that, but simple things that can be resolved should be, otherwise the story leaves more questions than it answers. That is the case with 5ive Days To Midnight, it's really well written and has an outstanding cast, but being that it's four hours long, there wasn't any reason to leave parts of the story unfinished. The conclusion was therefore the best and worst part of the whole thing. The ending was fast paced and exciting, real edge of your seat type stuff, but as soon as it was over, there was a small two minute conversation, and then that was it. With all the time the writers spent on the back story and the introduction to the characters, to just leave us with a story that basically just abruptly ends, was defiantly disappointing to me.

What doesn't disappoint is the other three hours and forty-five minutes of this mini-series. I find that with mini-series, a lot of times the description and preview are actually better than anything else, but that's not the case here. This is a well written mystery, with some great action sequences, mixed with Science Fiction, and there is even a mob element to the whole thing. Timothy Hutton stars as the professor and gives the performance of a life time. How does one investigate their own murder and protect their ten year old daughter at the same time? His character was in a unique situation that really came off well. The whole package is outstanding, which is why the disappointing ending really bothers me more than it probably should.",1414281600,,2442,4.68997668997669

2116761,4,B0002S94BQ,"My afternoon matinee was a most interesting four-part miniseries called 5IVE DAYS TO MIDNIGHT (USA/Canada-2004).

SYNOPSIS
While physics professor J.T. Neumeyer is visting his wife's grave on the 10th anniversary of her death, a mysterious gray metallic case materializes out of thin air. Inside Neumeyer finds photos and a police report indicating he will be shot dead in just five days. The pictures are authentic, and all the papers, although currently dated, are by the looks of them, decades old.

The professor is convinced this case was sent to him from the future. As with all good murder mysteries we are offered a number of possible killers, and as usual in such stories, the solution is one you aren't likely to come by easily. It's an excellent twist on the whodunit genre, a sort-of whoWILLdo it.

Stars Timothy Hutton as the prof, Gage Golightly as 10-year-old Jesse Neumeyer, born on the day her mom died, Randy Quaid as a homicide detective that gets involved in a killing that hasn't yet happened, Kari Matchett as Hutton's GF, Angus Macfadyen as a violent mobster who's also Matchett's outraged husband, Hamish Linklater as the weirdo student most likely to, and Giancarlo Esposito as Hutton's newspaper editor pal.",1383696000,2,1233,5.034313725490196

2116763,5,B0002S94BQ,"Timothy Hutton and a fine cast  give us an interesting four episode (44 minutes each) mystery drama in which the 'murder is announced' five days previous to its occurrence. Foreshadowed, too, are a series of preliminary events which, as the days remaining are reduced, come true as predicted. The availability of a 2-DVD set at a reasonable price (right now) is exactly what suits my taste. Rather than having to endure delays from episode to episode, one can see two a night for two nights and, thereby, not experience the weakening of impact due to the time lag. There are some weaknesses, of course, but none that affect the experience to a noticeable degree. This is not one of those films or series which will be remembered and revisited over the years. It is good solid television watching of a superior sort.",1378684800,,815,4.73943661971831

It's a fairly good story overall, but gets tedious at times and predictable as to what plot device they're going to use next.  You are rather kept guessing as to who did it...though my initial hunch was spot-on, as what I figured was going to be the ending as well.  There were some annoying sequences of the main characters being spied on, and some typical bait and switch tactics as well, and a bit more of unrealistic mafia boss acting thrown in as well. Not really a spoiler, but if he did what he did to me, and not our hero...I'd have capped him right then and there...you'll know what I mean.

The acting was fairly well done throughout and what special effects there were seemed good enough considering it was made-for-TV.  I couldn't believe just how fat Randy Quaid got...wow...that's the biggest surprise...and his acting skills are more fitted for Vacation movies and odd-ball stuff.  No need to rehash plot...everybody else did that already.  I'd suggest writing down your first hunch...see if you got it right.

The only really face-smackingly obvious thing is what motivates the killer, and the all-too unrealistic *SPOILER* attitude that Hutton's character has in not taking full advantage of knowledge of the future and the predictable set-up he causes by not sharing or taking advantage of the wealth that could be made from it. I hate when people don't act realistic when it comes to money. Really...would you turn down fore-knowledge of technology that could make you a bazillion dollars? If you said yes, then I'll take that winning lotto ticket off your hands. It should have been OBVIOUS that this was the driving factor in motivating his death...which rates this movie lower on the believability scale for him not even remotely figuring that out and acting to change that.

I think I enjoyed this a bit only because it reminded me a lot of Lost and the ""What Happened Happened"" theme throughout...and the characters' struggles knowing what happens to see what they can do to change it.  If you liked Lost for this, you will find this worth watching. Seriously, I wouldn't pay much...since you'll probably not want to watch it again...which is why I went to see if my library had it.  They did.  You can always donate your copy so others can watch...and you can always go get it if you get the feeling you just have to see it again.",1297209600,4,2507,4.709382151029748

The story is intersting with those wonderful sci-fi twists. While not a true time travel tale where characters go on the trip, the storyline does have intrigue. Other reviewers have covered the plot well enough. I just want to let you who love ""time"" stories know you should give this one a chance. Ain't earth shattering or precedent setting, but is a fun watch. Enjoy!  }:o)",1293580800,,503,4.456521739130435

SYNOPSIS--
Four-part Sci-Fi Channel miniseries about a college professor who finds a mysterious metallic briefcase containing news clippings and police reports that describe his murder, which is to occur in five days time. While he seeks a way to escape such a violent demise, a Seattle police detective works to apprehend the killer before a crime is even committed. Well-made, a good concept, but has a copout ""surprise"" ending.

Parethentical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.

2116781,5,B0002S94BQ,"I found this miniseries to be absolutely riveting, with plenty of suspence, an 'unexpected' plot twist (there's always an unexpected plot twist, so you expect the unexpected!), and very good acting.  It was a very pleasant way to spend the evening, and I highly recommend it for mystery and sci-fi fans alike.",1282867200,,309,4.9423076923076925
2116782,3,B0002S94BQ,"At the heart of this mini-series is a good SF idea about whether knowledge of the future enables you to change it.

There are good performances from Randy Quaid, a Kari Matchett, and Gage Golightly but the story depends on us caring whether Timothy Hutton makes it past the hour appointed for his death and Hutton doesn't build any empathy for his character. Partly this is poor writing and partly it is just lack of charisma.

The series splits into days and each of the 5 is written by a different writer and it showed. This approach my help keep long running series fresh but it loses the continuity and consistency needed for a mini-series.

The story also backs off the physics at the end, making the whole thing into more of a Disney Channel cop show than a good SF story. I expected a more competent job from a director with Michael Watkins' background.

2116792,4,B0002S94BQ,"A pretty good mini-series, and the end is not very predictable, but for hard-core sci-fi fans there are a bunch of holes in the time travel plot. That and the story drags on at times.  However, overall it is pretty cool, the cinamatography is well done and the series gets you thinking about the grandfather (or in this case maybe grandson) paradox.  I just don't see myself watching this again anytime soon.",1193443200,,408,4.652777777777778
2116793,5,B0002S94BQ,"This was quite a find!  Timothy Hutton plays Professor J.T. Neumeyer, a physicist who comes across a mysterious case bearing his name, and containing files of an unsolved murder investigation - his murder - which occurred (will occur) five days in the future.

At first he believes it to be a crude hoax.  However, certain elements of the murder, as detailed in the files, begin falling into place that suggest something more than just mere coincidence.  As he investigates further, Neumeyer enlists the help of the homicide detective (Randy Quaid) who investigated (will investigate) his murder.  The biggest clue is the suspect list, which includes his girlfriend, brother-in-law, an eccentric graduate student, and an unknown man.

The series is wonderfully crafted and keeps you guessing as to who the murderer was (will be).  The filmmakers successfully establish motives and/or raise doubts about the intentions of the suspects.  In a way, it is somewhat similar to Minority Report in the sense of trying to unravel and prevent a murder which hasn't happened yet.

Overall, this was a great mini-series.  Highly recommended for fans of the genre(s).",1155686400,,1155,5.194594594594594
2116794,5,B0002S94BQ,"This movie is good, but I sort of agree with the former review. It lasts too long. You'd better watch it by parts as it was meant originally. You might not like this one if you're from the ones who need many explanations in the movies (as I do very often). However, those missing explanations will not keep you from understanding the movie's plot. I started a discussion forum so that people can guess how they would've filled those holes.

Finally, the movie's start is nothing great by itself. Anyone who likes fantasy and thrillers might have watched similar starings as in this movie. So the filmmakers added a lot of sci-fi effects, cheap but funny ones. The moved the camera in slow motion in some scenes, in others they show a lot of weird (or artistic) scenes behind the characters like mathematical symbols, nothing really creative but pretty. But as the movie continues it gets more and more interesting.....otherwise I wouldn't have stayed for 4 or 5 hours!",1143763200,45,968,4.727810650887574

The plot was engaging, if a little predictable.  The performances were good, if not stellar.  The subplots were just a tad underdeveloped, and Nicole DeBoer's character seemed almost extraneous for such a talented actress.  Do I recommend it?  Yes, not a bad way to spend the weekend.
