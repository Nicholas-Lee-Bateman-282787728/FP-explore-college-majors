8457158,5,B002GU77MG,"The story is a classic blueprint of dark, campy horror than never reaches the cheesy, young, half naked kids getting wild in the woods, and a slasher with a blood lust of near supernatural proportions.  The concept is classic but maintains a fresh, electric energy that never tires, and even comes with a high-concept fantasy element that plays well against the slasher set-up. Although the humor is more satirical instead of spoof, the comedic aspect of Kids Go To The WoodsKids Get Dead shows a fun, wittier side to the writing that creates an attitude of modernization as opposed to retro rip-off. The direction and writing work on all levels in this entertaining slasher flick.

Kids Go To The WoodsKids Get Dead has some pretty stellar special effects in the film. The kill scenes are expect but Hall doesnt shy away from producing the visceral, gory kills. Kill sequences that work well, give full-on carnage and look as clean as any film with a higher budget could manage. It is some impressive use of practical effects that prove low budget horror can be every bit as good as big budget horror. Honestly Kids Get Dead shows that the genre still has break out potential that made classic slashers worldwide phenoms.

The sound effects and soundtracks used in Kids Get Dead is pretty much what we have come to expect in horror. The eerie, creepy sounds mix with cool music to create the desired atmosphere needed to sell the film. The timing of certain sounds and songs at key points do feel slightly played out, but they fit the moments they frame so they work. The choice of music is pretty rocknroll and does offer an electrifying feel to the story. Honestly throughout the whole film all I could do was feel renewed excitement for the indie horror genre.",1431129600,,1764,4.720779220779221
8457159,3,B002GU77MG,"It was O.K, I liked the whole idea of making it feel like you were watching one of those old horror movie shows from the late 80's early 90's that would have a horror host late at tnight introducing cheesy horror movies. That was a cool idea. The movie itself was not bad, the villian was effective and made for a nice villian. The kids were decent, especially the heroine and her brother. Special effects were not really a big part of the movie, and the idea of the way things were done was different. Could have been gorier and the killer being almost indestructable was weird, since all they had was a gas mask.",1428624000,,614,4.3478260869565215
8457160,3,B002GU77MG,A good solid horror film that is worth checking out.,1425081600,,52,4.3
8457161,1,B002GU77MG,"Microbudget c-horror-comedy. It is what it is... bad acting, no scares, etc... But, with a title like that, and the trailer, you should pretty much know what you're getting yourself into before renting this one. I did rent it, and regretted not watching the trailer. lol  But, hey, looks like they all had fun making the movie and it was probably a fun project.

Just remember, it's a horror-comedy, and it doesn't have any scares or chills - it's all in good fun.

Personally, I didn't care for it, but it might be fun for 4:20 on a Sunday with a group of friends in your living room with a ton of munchies.",1424995200,,608,4.3628318584070795
8457162,2,B002GU77MG,"Well, I'll give them points for trying to be different. A meta slasher film with an unnecessary and distracting horror host interruptions that add nothing to the film. Some gore, some boobs, lesbians, fake commercials and promise of a sequel. For slasher completists only.",1420156800,,272,5.204545454545454
8457163,3,B002GU77MG,"Here we have a nicely made independent feature about a bunch of college type kids who get killed in various way. They take a vacation to an isolated place in Hicksville USA. As it turns out of course a masked killer is running loose racking up the body count. If you appreciate independent horror then this film will be worth your time. Also if you like this film then I highly recommend you check out ""The Bible Belt Slasher Part 1 & 2"" also for sale here on Amazon. This is another well made independent cult 80's horror flick that really brings home the bacon for the slasher fan!",1397001600,,583,4.3577981651376145
8457164,5,B002GU77MG,"If a B rated slasher film looked at itself and the mirror and said ""your good enough, your scary enough, and gosh darn it people like you!"" this is the reflection it would see!  It brought me right back to my childhood watching the late night stabfests with my babysitter!  Yes it is a lost art and NO the makers of the movie were not trying to live up to some 21st Century ""found film"" BS that is all the rage.  This is vintage baby!  I have a copy of this DVD and play it on a continuous loop every Halloween.  Why?  Because its thematic!  It is like going to Jekyll & Hydes in Manhattan to see all the Bela Lugosi films playing in the background.  It sets the tone!  Its fun!  Plus I like to support small independent film makers.  It is Directors like Michael Hall who keep pushing the envelope, working to improve their craft.  Stay in it for the thrill and emotional gain they get.  Not just crank out crap for the masses!  This looked about as fun to make as it was to watch!  I love it!",1366848000,2,994,4.130890052356021
