1722365,5,B0000687DB,Visconti's 'La Terra Trema' is about as detailed account of a fishing village you may ever watch (about 3 hours long) - but the rewards of this film are endless. Visconti has a unique flair for developing characters that the audience gradually comes to care about ('Death in Venice' is a prime example). This film here is neo-realist in every sense of the term - and also an interesting look at some of Viscont's Marxist - and yet skeptical of Marxism - views. He is probably the only wealthy Count in the world ever capable of such feeling towards the poor - the film in a way forshadows Pasolini's brilliant 'Accatone' - which also focused on the lower end of society. This is a fully rewarding dose of Visconti - highly recommended!,1100649600,7,735,4.575757575757576
1722366,5,B0000687DB,"I had read about this movie because it comes up on an occassional ""All Time Greatest Movie"" lists.  As such, I was aware of the fact that the movie was made with a complete cast of amateurs taken from a Sicilian fishing village which was also the location of the movie.  The opening credits substantiate that by not naming the actors but, rather, citing them as the people of the village.  They do a very good, sometimes excellent, job.  There might not be an Academy Award-level preformance in the bunch but they out-shine the cast of most ""B"" movies I've seen.  In fact, only the person who plays Mara's boy friend, the mason, give anything like a one-dimensional preformance and it is mostly noticeable by how it stands apart from the others.
The story is that of a struggle against the powers that be; sometimes the powers are people, sometimes it is nature.  The focus is on one family who tries to overcome their poverty by buying their own boat and becoming their own boss.  The instigator is the son, Ntonio, who has been in the army and seen the outside world.  He is ready to level the playing field and, at first, the family succeeds.  However, the writer/director Visconti does not intend to give us a quick happy ending.  Misfortune strikes and we see success turn to failure.  The movie becomes a sort of Marxist message that only when everyone works collectively for the common good can we all succeed.  However, I did not feel that this message was overbearing to the viewer who is not inclined to buy into that philosophy.  There is much in the movie that could even substantiate Capitalism.  Look, for example, how Ntonio and his family succeed when they save up their money, mortgage their house and go into business for themselves.  The writer/director's point might be that their own greed led them to failure but it could easily be just a twist of fate that kept them from rising to the top.  This example of individual initiative is a powerful part of the story.  Nonetheless, it is the depths of the descent that comes after success that takes us through the film.
I rated this film a ""5 star"" because of its' cinematic achievement.  Visconti worked something short of a miracle on a shoestring in putting this film together.  On the negative side, the movie is too long (Visconti appartently had to ""cut"" it to 160 minutes).  In addition the politics is too one-sided.  I don't profess to know how things were in a post-war fishing village in Sicily.  I presume that much of the scenarios presented are close to the reality of the time and place.  However, nothing succeeds like a good example and the idea that no one would attempt to duplicate the family's idea struck me more as a comment on the fishermen than a comment on the system.  Still, the interpersonal relationships and the life in the village are brought to the screen in such an excellent way that I'll let the politics be.",1088294400,15,2913,4.611650485436893
1722367,3,B0000687DB,"I've searched a very long time to see this movie. I've noticed that all of Luchino Visconti's films are extremely hard to obtain. Now that I have finally seen this movie I have seen everything that is available on vhs or dvd by the great Visconti.
 ""La Terra Trema"" reminds me heavily of a film Visconti would make later entitled ""Rocco & His Brothers"". Both films deal with poor Sicilan families trying to make a living. Each family facing the injustice of the upper class vs the lower class. But between the two I must admit I prefer ""Rocco..ect"". Because it seems to be more about plot. ""Rocco"" has more of a story to tell. And it's three lead characters make the the movie. ""La Terra Trema"" is a little short on plot. And the film goes on way too long. The movie is over 2 hours.
 ""La Terra Trema"" is about the local fishing community. About the hardships the fisherman face when trying to sell their fish to the merchants. The merchants it is felt are cheating the fisherman out of decent pay. The begining moments of the film work quite well. But the plot cann't sustain the entire lenght of the plot. If this movie had been cut down to at least let's say 1 hour and 45 minutes this could of truly been an unforgettable Visconti masterpiece. As the film is now it's an enjoyable over-long Visconti epic and has choice acting moments,by non actors, & beautiful cinematography.
 Luchino Visconti is one of my all-time favorite film-makers. He had an unmatched talent for details. He has given us so many entertaining films such as ""Ludwig"", to me his masterpiece. Also ""Rocco & His Brothers"", ""The Damned"", & ""The Innocent"", his final film. ""La Terra Trema"" belongs high up on Visconti's list of films. If anything just for the acting. *** 1\2 out of *****
 Bottom-line: One of Visconti's best films. A little long but has it's share of strong moments. Worth while for all Visconti fans.",1063584000,13,1891,4.569321533923304
1722368,4,B0000687DB,"I have had something like a thirty year desire to see this, director Luchino Visconti's second film. To my knowledge, it has never enjoyed wide theatrical distribution, which given its content and tone, is hardly surprising. A relentlessly downbeat view of the lives of Sicilian fishermen, it's also a tad on the long side. Still, to have it available on video is a wonderful treat. I can't imagine myself watchiing it frequently, but it has a compositional integrity that more than compensates for the depressing subject matter.
Never having seen the film projected, I cannot gauge the effectiveness of the video transfer. My guess is that it is so-so: good enough to give a sense of what the film looks like but not produced with enough care to bring out all the richness of detail and contrast. The opening credits, for example, superimposed over images of dawn in the fishing village, are barely intelligible. With a little more effort, the disc producers could probably have found a way to make the sequence work on video. As it is, we more or less have to imagine what it would look like.
""La Terra Trema"" is Italian Neorealism at its most epic. Unlike De Sica's ""Bicycle Thief,"" for example, which reveals the tragedy of one man's decline, ""Terra"" self-consciously uses the Valastro family as an example of a larger phenomenon. Visconti makes no effort to conceal his political prejudices, at one point clearly identifying the corrupt, exploitive wholesalers with the recently deposed Mussolini regime while relentlessly identifying the central characters' problems with social and economic forces.
The hopelessness of the situation is relieved only by the internal cohesion of the family which, nonetheless, undergoes severe tests. While we can well imagine the Valastros sinking even lower after the film's ambiguous ending, what is most striking about the film more than fifty years after its release, is its essential *optimism.* The call for a united front to withstand exploitation is good, old-fashioned Marxism at its most bald and unapologetic. The film's unabashed faith in human nature and the possibility of positive change feels not so much naive as nostalgic, the product of a time when it was still possible to believe in broad, systemic change. Wrapped in Visconti's well-known eye for sensuous spectacle, ""La Terra Trema"" is a good two-and-a-half hour tract just shy of convincing.",1029974400,35,2405,5.122137404580153

7963652,5,B0000687DB,"This is a wonderful release of a film central to the history of the early stages of cinematic modernism. La Terra Trema (The Earth Trembles) is one of Luchino Visconti's greatest achievements and here it gets a pin-sharp absolutely faithful transfer from BFI which showcases Aldo Graziati's astounding deep focus photography and strikingly beautiful compositions to great effect. One caveat - the disc could do with a couple of extras. The prospect of a neorealist semi-documentary made in 1948 featuring an amateur cast going about their everyday lives as fishermen isn't likely to set the average viewer's pulse racing. A decent documentary explaining the historical context and the reasons why this film is so highly revered together with an intelligent commentary along the lines of the one provided for BFI's own release of The Leopard would have been helpful here. I mustn't grumble though - at least the film has English subtitles which is more than the showing I saw at the NFT 20 years ago had!

So why is this film so celebrated? First and foremost is its place in the Italian neorealist movement. People usually associate neorealism with Roberto Rossellini (Rome Open City, Paisan, Germany Year Zero) and Vittorio De Sica (Bicycles Thieves, Shoeshine), but actually Visconti beat both of them to it with his first feature Ossessione (Obsession) in 1942. That film was a bootleg adaptation of James M. Cain's The Postman Always Rings Twice. Unlike the later smoother Hollywood versions, this film features grimy real locations and showed a sordid very authentic view of the Italian countryside. The film caught the imagination of the Italian public who were bored with the artificiality of the rich life shown in the 'White Telephone' Italian films and in Hollywood products of the time. Suddenly they had something which appealed directly to them and their everyday socio-economic travails. Rossellini, De Sica, Visconti, Fellini, Rosi, Zeffirelli and lesser lights all banded together to form a neorealist movement, a movement devoted to a new cinema that would be for and about the lives of working class people. Big stars, studios and heavily detailed melodrama would be down-played in favor of the use of amateur actors, real locations and semi-documentary improvised methods designed to showcase the poverty that afflicted so many in Italy, particulary in the Mezzogiorno (the South). In fact, most of these neorealist films were heavily compromised which made people particularly in the Hollywood system sceptical. Rome Open City (1945) was made in the ruins of the nation's capital and is a fine film, but the Nazis are stereotyped as homosexuals and the film is heavily scripted melodrama with Anna Magnani achieving star status with it. Bicycle Thieves (1948) also may be very moving, but the melodrama is manufactured to a large degree and we are as manipulated emotionally by the music and the sad story as we are by superior Hollywood studio products of the time.

La Terra Trema stands out from the rest as being the film which most embodies the tenets of the neorealist manifesto. A semi-documentary (the commentary voiced by Visconti himself), shot on location, featuring an amateur cast, focusing on the trials and tribulations of local fishermen, using local dialect as opposed to straightforward Italian so that rich Italian audiences in the North needed subtitles as much as foreigners did, avoiding deliberate emotional manipulation (the use of music is kept to a minimum) and relying on reaction shots of real people in real situations (especially children), La Terra Trema is an extraordinary statement for the time - one which really opened up people's eyes worldwide as to the possibilities of what cinema could do. Of course Visconti, Fellini and De Sica were later to shake off their neorealist roots in pursuit of more modernist inquiries, and it was this journey that would inspire the explosions of modernism that later took place in the shape of the French New Wave, the New German Cinema and other modernist experiments of the 60s. La Terra Trema is an extremely important film in cinema's swing from 'film as popular entertainment' to 'film as artistic inquiry', in this case a documentation of social conscience. Rooted in the everyday concerns of a poor Sicilian fishing community and told with the bare minimum of directorial manipulation, the film is as honest an artistic statement as there ever has been in cinema outside the world of the documentary.

It's always surprising to me that such a film for the people was made by an aristocrat. Count Visconti (to give him his proper title) was a communist and La Terra Trema was part financed by the Italian communist party and finished with money Visconti got from selling off some of his family's assets. It was initially meant as the first part of a trilogy gradually leading up to a revolution. The fact that only the first part was shot means that instead of ending on a forced communist propagandistic note of triumph at the end of part three, it ends at the end of part one on quiet defeat, but with the dignity of the afflicted (in this case the poor Valastro family) kept intact. Visconti keeps his cameras largely distant and respectful so that we have the feeling that he is honoring his subjects. Traces of politics do remain, a fascist sign on the wall behind the wholesalers clashing with the hammer and sickle shots shown outside their office, but Visconti avoids the pitfalls of stereotyped propagandizing to produce a moving picture of working people downtrodden by circumstances beyond their control.

Visconti chose to adapt Giovanni Verga's novel I Malavoglia (The House by the Medlar Tree) and visited Aci Trezza, the fishing village in Sicily where the novel is set. Noticing that the village had barely changed since the 1880s he chose to shoot the film on location right there. The only time we leave the village is to go fishing with the boats and then in the minds of the Valastros who have to go to Catania to mortgage their home. The film is the very simple story of how the fishermen are manipulated by the wholesalers and kept in poverty by their fierce demands. 'Ntoni Valastro decides to break away and set up his family on their own. Initially, things go well with other villagers supporting them. But one day they have to put to sea in a storm. Their boat is ruined and then everything falls down around them. They are forced to sell their fish to the wholesalers they despise, the family grandfather dies and personal relationships in the village sour as the family are ostracized. The bailiffs evict them from their home and the family are mired in poverty worse than ever before. The film finishes with 'Ntoni giving into the wholesalers' demands and putting to sea with another crew so that he can support the family. Visconti's conclusion would appear to be that an improvement in the fishermen's lot will only happen if they all unite and throw off the control exerted by the wholesalers. The fact that nobody follows 'Ntoni's example dooms him to ruin, but the film honors his noble efforts for trying. It's hardly the triumphant victory over the bosses that the communist party wanted, but the conclusion catches just the right note of defiant nobility that Visconti was aiming for.

La Terra Trema may be based on a novel with the central story of class rebellion and there is a hint of melodrama as Visconti digs for an audience reaction to the plight of the Valastros, but that is as far as artificial manipulation from the film-makers goes, Visconti's spoken narration putting everything at a correct distance. The film is mostly devoted to simply recording the everyday lives of the fishermen. Takes tend to be lengthy, long shots of the sea dominating your memory long after the film finishes, especially those famous shots of women on the rocks awaiting their men to come back from the storm, the silhouettes standing out strikingly against the white background of the sky. Visconti is not afraid to employ medium close-ups for action sequences depicting the fishermen fighting. Fades and dissolves are deployed judiciously to give the impression of time passing slowly, languidly. 'Ntoni's youngest brother watches his elders fight and their tragedy echoes silently and with great effect across his face and the faces of other children in the village. Visconti never underlines or exaggerates emotions as he was prone to do in his later more operatic works. Instead we have beautiful images of noble despair as the Valastros battle against the elements and the society of the village. 'Ntoni's brother Cola shows a different response to the poverty trap by choosing to leave for the rich North. This exodus from poverty was an avenue Visconti was later to explore in Rocco and his Brothers (1960) where a similar family mired in poverty migrate north to try their luck in Milan. By that time though, Visconti had turned his back on neorealism. He may have spoken of Rocco and his Brothers being a sequal to La Terra Trema, but the film-making styles are really poles apart. I strongly urge anyone interested at all in neorealism and the origins of cinematic modernism to buy this film and see what the fuss is all about. Initial viewing expectations might be dark and grim, but believe me, once seen, this is a film you'll never forget.",1411430400,2,9382,4.950507614213198

7963655,5,B0000687DB,"Luchino Visconti shot this remarkable neorealist movie with amateur actors, who played their role sublimely.
He tells a brutal story of a naked struggle for survival of a family in a village of fishermen in Sicily. The fishermen are confronted with a buyer's monopoly of a bunch of wholesalers, who give them a minimum price for their catches (`the poor always pay').
One fisherman tries to break the monopoly by creating his own business. But, therefore he has to mortgage the ancestral house.

Luchino Visconti's movie is a Malthusian story: only the prosperous can love and marry.
His movie is also a Marxist story. It sets the wholesalers (the capitalists) against the fishermen. When the wholesalers pool their money and buy new boats, the fishermen's only choice is to sell their labor force. Now, they don't even own the fish they have caught.
The movie has a main message: only solidarity among the laborers can be a basis for a society of free associates.

Luchino Visconti was the assistant director during the shooting of the movie `Toni' in which Jean Renoir used amateur actors. `Toni' paints also the fate of (Spanish) journeymen in France. But, there is an essential difference between Jean Renoir's and Luchino Visconti's movie: Toni doesn't transcend the personal level of his characters (their love lives), while in `La Terra Trema' the lives of the protagonists are embedded in a real general socio-economic environment.

Luchino Visconti shot a most memorable social drama, maintaining throughout the movie a most impressive emotional and typically local atmosphere.

7963657,4,B0000687DB,"A Marxist aristocrat, Count Don Luchino Visconti Di Morone was widely praised for both the realism and vaguely politicized tone of his early films, and the operatic sumptuousness of his later historical costume dramas... Throughout his career, however, style dominated content; all too often, the result was camp, decorative melodrama disguised as solemn, socially significant art...

""La Terra Trema,"" an epic account of the hardship suffered by Sicilian fishermen, was even closer to Neo-realism, shot on location with a cast of nonprofessional actors living their lives on screen... Its somewhat simplistic Marxist message, that the peasants' real enemy was not Nature but exploitive businessmen, was in fact less indicative of Visconti's future and its use of a disintegrating family to mirror the social climate of Italy as a whole...

The conflicts, misery, poverty, joy, and anger in a fishing village are shown in a panoramic study of man and earth...

La Terra Trema is a powerful portrait of a small village of fishermen, where the hopeless and the oppressive reality surrounds every single frame. At the moment you elaborate a list about primordial films of the Italian Neo Realism, this movie must necessarily included.
