5007903,5,B006NO1SVM,"There was a 2004 German production of this difficult to stage singspiel:
Konstanze - Diana Damrau
Blonde - Kerstin Avemo
Belmonte - Daniel Kirch
Pedrill - Peter Marsh
Osmin - Jaco Huijpen
Bassa Selim - Christoph Quest
With the exception of Damrau and Quest, the other protagonists are all new in this 2010 Liceu production.  Belmonte was Christoph Strehl, and Blonde of Olga Pereyatko, Pedrillo of Norbet Ernst and with Franz Josef Selig as Osmin.
The character of Bassa Selim is a speaking role without singing, and Quest and Damrau acted with impeccable skill, while Damrau tackles the fiendishly demanding arias of konstanze at the same time.
The 2004 performance was on Youtube for some years already, and I first caught glimpse of Damrau's performance of the extended version 'Marten aller Arten' on Youtube and was totally bowed over by her superlative performance then.  I got the DVD right away in order not to miss such 'great stuff'.
In this reprisal after 6 years, I am even happier to see that Damrau has in effect outdid herself in this Liceu performance.
Her voice gained more colour and warmth after the birth of her first son, and her breath control in this Liceu performance is simply perfection itself in the various big arias of Konstanze.
Her 'supporting cast' of Ernst, Selig and Pereyatko are equally illustrious. Pereyatko's colourful lyrical soprano is a real treat to the ears, and shr acts well, with a very fine stage presence. Norbert Ernst as Pedrillo is also a clever choice, being marked different in statute with Strehl's Belmonte so as not to confuse the two lyrical tenor roles' places in this opera.
If there are any qualms on the staging, one must not forget that this work is one of the operas that are most difficult to stage - there are long musical introductions to big arias that would virtually kill any skilful director. And the singers are not one jot better off in this regard.  The direction in this production is effective, if not perfect.
The Belmonte in this production is the seasoned Mozartian tenor Christoph Strehl. Believe it or not, in this wonderfully outstanding cast, Strehl has not a single bit of edge over his ultra-capable colleagues.",1341964800,5,2196,4.866310160427807
5007904,5,B006NO1SVM,"This most recent taping of Mozart's Die Entfurung aus dem Serail is radically different from all previous investitures. The director, Christof Loy, has opted to include all the dialogue that in all previous recordings has been trimmed-- in varying degrees. Further he has directed his actors to speak in a more conversational level with pauses--as if were a play. Considering that his audience is Spanish..........

Additionally conductor, Ivor Bolton, has adopted tempi that are slower than usual. What this performance has that previous editions have lacked is a Konstanze who is truly up to the vocal and dramatic task, a very difficult one. It should be added that all the singers in this production are able to meet the challenges. Blonde needs a high Eflat in her arsenal; Belmonte needs agility (Ich baue ganze) and a sweetness and  lyricism but enough metal in his voice to differentiate him from Pedrillo who shares similar requirements. Konstanze, though is faced with the greatest challenges. In Act I she has only one aria, but in Act II she has two: Traurigkeit followed by Matern aller Arten. Taken together the two arias ask everything of the soprano: agility, dramatic thrust, pathos, lyricism, and artistry. Damrau manages it as if it were the easiest thing in the world. Considering that her two most recent CD releases are devoted to lieder, she is clearly a contender for the title of leading German soprano and this is not even taking into consideration her facility with the Italian repertoire--notably a recent triumph at the Met in L'elisir. Christoph Strehl, the Belmonte is an accomplished musician as well, managing the inordinate difficulties of his arias. The other singer occupying this high level of accommplishment is Franz-Josef Selig, our Osmin. The original Osmin for Mozart was gifted with great low notes so Mozart accommodated him. Alas few basses of the last century enjoyed the same gift with the exception of Kipmis and Kurt Moll. Selig comes closer than most with the e xception of Kurt
Rydl, the Osmin in the Euro-Arts taping. Indeed this performance is the one that most auditors will prefer. Tempos are quicker, the production conventional and the singers taken as a whole are up to the task. All are German with the exception of Ruth Ann Swenson. The dialogue has been cut and in the the case of Swenson who virtually has only a few lines, doubtless because of her lack of expertise with the language. I know of no other German role that she has sung.

Loy's direction has little humor. Much of the dialogue between Selim and Konstanze is long and protracted and played for high drama. Obviously some of this is necessary; after all Selim is in love with Konstanze who doesn't return the emotion. Osmin lusts after Blonde but it is an unrequired lust. Much of the humor is of necessity uneasy, but depending on how Selim is played makes a great deal of difference. Of course we know how it ends and regardless of the director's conception it has a happy ending even if the  attempt to escape has been compromised. How one responds to Loy's direction depends on personal tastes. Mozart did label his opera a ""Komische Oper"" which is quite different from Italian ""Opera Buffa""; but even so, Loy has chosen to go down a different path. Loy has also chosen not to set the opera in a recognizable Turkey of any century and accordingly the constumes are ""modern"" with only a nod to the Levantine while the EuroArts productionis conventional --as are most of the other DVD's available. Loy's production is minimalism at its most unattractive with nary a nod towards its geographical setting. It surely most be the least expensive! One's feeling about the extensive dialogue is another decision that one will have to make. Given my druthers I would have preferred to see it trimmed. This is not deathless prose; in fact it has been criticized by German writers and speakers and even rewtritten on occasion. Ultimately this is a personal decision that the buyer will have to make.

I have rated this set with five stars because of the musical and vocal aspects of the production. All the singers are extraordinarly gifted and all are attractive performers who have followed Loy's decisions even though I find some of them actually work against the opera. One can't rate productions separately from the musical so I defend my rating of five stars with teh caveats cited above.",1332720000,14,4412,4.8773333333333335
5007905,5,B006NO1SVM,"There's an in-built difficulty in Mozart's earliest 'mature' comic opera that every modern opera stage director must consider a challenge - the long passages of unaccompanied spoken dialogue and recitative that are scattered throughout.  Yes, the actual drama of Die Entfhrung Aus Dem Serail is a bit silly too and the libretto isn't the most sophisticated, but even if you manage to make the plot work dramatically (having good singers can help gloss over the inconsistencies which is certainly the case here), you're still left with those lulls between Mozart's beautiful musical passages that can potentially kill the opera dead in its tracks.  This production by Christof Loy at the Liceu in Barcelona, aided and abetted by an outstanding cast and an exhilarating performance of the score from the Liceu orchestra under Ivor Bolton, crucially takes account of those weaknesses, and if the result is still not entirely convincing, it's nonetheless still one of the best versions of this Mozart opera that you're ever likely to come across.

Traditionally, the way of handling the spoken dialogue in Die Entfhrung Aus Dem Serail is to heavily trim it and get it out of the way as quickly as possible so as to move on to the music, but such an approach fails to adequately take into account the fact that the main dramatic drive of the opera actually lies in between the musical numbers and arias.  In some respects, it could be argued that the spoken passages are equally as important as the arias, if not even more so in this particular case since Mozart's music for Die Entfhrung Aus Dem Serail is not the most lyrically attuned to the emotional content.  Christof Loy attempts to address the vacuity of the arias and the dead-space of the dialogue by getting the singers to act properly.  There is no declamation of the lines here as they would more commonly be expressed, but rather Loy directs the performers to deliver the lines naturalistically and makes use of their silences in the same way that he makes use of space on the stage to define the relationship between them.

Loy's direction isn't really geared towards appeasing traditionalists then - the sets are sparse (although not as sparse as the director usually decorates them) and the costumes don't reflect any specific period, although there is a nod towards a middle-eastern flavour in some of the attire - but it should at least be evident that this is a respectful production that is aimed towards making the best out of what is an imperfect opera, one that the director clearly thinks deserves to be considered more than just a lightweight entertainment.  He doesn't always succeed, but it's an impressive attempt that is given additional merit from the terrific, lively account of the score under Ivor Bolton that works well in conjunction with the staging.  The singing is of an exceptionally high standard right across the board, but the performance of Diana Damrau deserves to be singled out as it's not only one of the best Konstanze's you'll ever hear, but when placed in the context of this fine treatment of the opera, it's an incredible tour de force performance that highlights the extraordinary abilities of one of the best sopranos in the world today.

An exceptional production - one of the best I've ever seen - the Blu-ray is just as impressive.  There are no extra features, but the HD image quality and the sound reproduction are amazing.  Subtitles are in German, English, French, Spanish, Catalan, Chinese and Korean.",1329264000,28,3510,4.900505902192243

8501415,1,B006NO1SVM,"I hope I can return ths DVD because it is defective. It does not play beyond Act II. Not that I am so anxious to see the rest, because I hated what I had seen. It is best to play the DVD with The TV off. This is Eurothrash in its maximum glory or better not to waste your money in this anti Mozart
thing.",1443571200,,304,3.6923076923076925
8501416,5,B006NO1SVM,"This is an excellent production. I like it. The principals look the part, sing the part, and act the part flawlessly. And, since the camera is so unforgiving in close-up, the viewer is treated to some stunnig visuals which the audience would not have been able to discern. Opera is more than singing. It requires the players not only to be able to carry a singing line, but to act in a convincing manner, and to look their part. Costumes and set are also necessary, and I found that this production succeeds in all five aspects. The singing is excellent, and in a few instances, outstanding. And  Christoph Quest as Selim Pasha is wonderful. He brings a humanity to the role which I have not seen before. There was some aprehension on my part about the inclusion of all the dialogue, but I found it very much enhanced my understanding of the play.  Combined with very good acting, direction, and staging, viewing this production was an enjoyable experience. The opera is more than three hours long, so sit down with a glass of good wine and prepare yourself for a excellent evening's entertainment. It also brought back wonderful memories of my performing the role of Belmonte, many, many, many years ago.",1433289600,4,1205,4.706161137440758
8501417,5,B006NO1SVM,"We were recently vacationing in Watamu (a little town near Malindi), Kenya, with an outstanding beautiful beach on the Indian Ocean, but with otherwise very little opportunities for cultural entertainment. So we took with us the DVDs of the Serail (with Diana Damrau and Christoph Quest), Figaro (with Erwin Schrott and Miah Persson), Cosi fan tutte (with Miah Pesson, Topi Lehtipuu and Luca Pisaroni), and some other DVDs.
The bottom line is that we enjoyed in Watamu all of them tremendously, particularly the three DVDs mentioned above.",1424822400,,539,5.206896551724138
8501418,4,B006NO1SVM,"In presenting all of the opera's dialog, rather than whittling it down to comic continuity between arias, this presentation gives us an experience (and an excellent one at that) probably approaching that of audience members at the time the opera was written. The full dialog as well as the probing direction bring depth beyond what is found in other versions that I have seen. All of the performances are first rate, and Diana Damrau is outstanding. The modernistic staging (de rigeur today, for better or for worse) does not detract from one's enjoyment of this very fine opera.  The sound of both the vocal and the orchestral performances on my BD version was exceptionally lifelike. All in all, watching this disk was a highly satisfying and uplifting experience.",1391644800,,766,4.984375
8501419,5,B006NO1SVM,Very good cast and orchestra. Fortunately the original spirit of the opera is manteined and Diana Damrau is a great singer and actrees,1380672000,,134,4.869565217391305
8501420,5,B006NO1SVM,"We laugh, we cry. As in Mozart's other great singspiel, Die Zauberflote, here we have broad, popular comedy next to great high-mindedness. It is overwhelming when it is as well done as it is here. Die Entfuhrung as dem Serail has not been very lucky on video - until now.

First, director Christof Loy's decision to employ the full spoken dialogue adds greatly to the work's stature. Mozart's dialogue, as in Zauberflote, and in the recitatives in Cosi, Figaro and Don Giovanni, in many ways forms the psychological insight and soul of these works. They are usually drastically cut in Entfuhrung (Minkowski's version on Bel Air is about one hour shorter than this!). The opera is noticeably longer here than I've ever heard it before, but all the richer and more concentrated, ironically, for the far fuller development of the psychological motives and emotions of the characters.

We understand far more than usual who these people are, what makes them tick, than is customary with the severe pruning the dialogue almost always receives. The comedy is still there but it is less vaudeville and more ironic than is customary. At times, the great seriousness of this performance almost makes the comedy seem from another work. The greater contrast than usual between these two elements reveals a richer, deeper experience in this work than I've ever seen before.

Loy and his outstanding singer/actors convey this seriousness with such commitment and conviction as to seemingly make this a new work. In other performances on DVD, it seems either too silly and insignificant, some singer or two is a weak link or the work just does not add up. Until now, I thought Mehta's Florence performance on TDK was the best I've seen. This supersedes it. It is more strongly conducted, more thorough and intense, and better filmed. Never have I been more moved by a performance of L'Entfuhrung.

Loy may underplay some of the the comic aspects of the work and does not give as customary a Turkish look to the scenery as other performances. But the Middle Eastern aspect of the work is still established in its own understated way, and the drama, as Loy sees it, is very powerful - the main crux of the work. This is what drives the action. The act one scenery - a table, chairs, paperwork, a fan and some Middle Eastern-looking outfits - detracts not a bit from the drama. We always know where we are.

The singing and portrayals here are simply outstanding, led by Diana Damrau's searing Konstanze. She is riveting in her intensity, conviction and vocal command. Her encounters with the outstandingly acted Pasha of Christoph Quest are particular highlights, especially Damrau's act two ""martern aller arten"", a noble and commanding scene as brilliantly done as I've ever seen. As befits Loy's conception, the women here (Olga Peretyatko a commanding Blonde) dominate the action even more than usual, rendering their partners, the sweet-toned Pedrillo of Norbert Ernst, and especially the noble Belmonte of Christoph Strehl somewhat less sympathetic than usual. The conducting of Ivor Bolton is also a highlight. He gets brilliant playing from the Liceu Orchestra, and brings great intensity and an idiomatic feel to the score to match Loy's dramatic conviction.

I do have two problems, however. One is the sound. It is indeed full and rich, but the contrast between the quieter dialogue and the arias is sometimes too great. It can be hard to hear some of the dialogue, but when you raise the volume the arias can be too loud. And I'd prefer the orchestra have a less forward perspective compared to the singers.

Second, I object to Loy's placing the Pasha in the middle of the action at the beginning of act three. When Belmonte, Konstanze, Blonde and Pedrillo are plotting their escape, it makes no sense to have the Pasha - from whom they are fleeing - be in the midst of the scene, sitting at a table with a bottle of wine, overhearing everything they are saying. Konstanze even sits across from him at one point and holds his hand. It does add poignancy to the scene, but it is still odd. Still, this is a small blot on an overall outstanding performance.

A final note. Don't miss the unique bows at the end, a truly modest endeavor from the principals. And for a performance not to be missed.",1374105600,4,4291,4.820652173913044
8501421,1,B006NO1SVM,I note that there are many versions of Mozart's Die Entfuhrung aus dem Serail available on Amazon. This is the only version I have seen. I recommend that you consider another version before purchasing this one. The direction and the cast of this production are weak. I cannot recommend the Barcelona version of Serail.,1366416000,,318,4.907407407407407
8501422,5,B006NO1SVM,Great Opera!!!  Christoph quest is Great as well.  Sound quality is top notch.  One of Mozart's greatest operas a joy to listen and watch!,1355184000,,138,4.666666666666667
8501423,5,B006NO1SVM,"Mozart wrote this work at the age of 25 having just left the service of the Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg and at the start of his freelance career as a musician. The work's commission was to be for the Emperor's own National Singspiel company as opposed to a commission for an opera, an important distinction as this turns the work into more of a play with singing than an opera (essentially a sung play).

This performance of Mozart's Singspiel, most importantly therefore, includes the whole of the dialogue. It is only by doing this of course that the work is able to make proper dramatic sense. Too often the dialogue is heavily cut. Consequently, in those cases, the whole concept of a Singspiel with its emphasis on the spoken word, as opposed to opera where the emphasis is on the sung word, is lost. No such errors are made here and this production generates great dramatic impact.

Of course, simply restoring the dialogue and failing to act it would also fail. In this case the dialogue is delivered by all the members of the cast with completely gripping effect. No sense of simple declamation, rather a real drama of interacting and conflicting passions. Great use is made of silences to heighten the impact of the drama.

The `twist' of this production concerns the clear implications of the title. `Abduction' from the harem implies that the girls are taken from the harem perhaps without their full consent or at least with conflicting emotions. Without this dramatic option an alternative title may have suggested a simple escape or flight from the harem more obviously. In this production therefore, it becomes clear that the two girls have learnt to respect their Turkish captors at the very least. Consequently their intended `rescue' by their former lovers is not quite as uncomplicated as it may have been. Nevertheless, Mozart's final music and libretto underlines their deeper commitment to their former partners with the over-riding emphasis being upon the need for mercy and understanding.

Musically the production sparkles and is led with great energy and also sensitivity by the conductor, Ivor Bolton. The two soprano leads (Damrau and Peretyatko) are very well sung indeed and they deliver their parts with total conviction. They are helped in this regard by the support of an impressively sung and acted Osmin (Selig) who has a deeply resonating voice ideally suited to the part and the non-singing part played by Christopher Guest as the Pasha. The two erstwhile suitors (Strehl and Ernst) maintain the high standards of the whole cast. The chorus is energetically effective on its rare appearances and extends the staging area by singing from two of the overhanging boxes.

This is an outstanding production combining real sparkle and dramatic drive. The recording is of equally high standard and delivers particularly sharp imaging and excellent sound of great clarity in either stereo or DTS-HD MA 5.1. This should give great enjoyment and satisfaction to purchasers and I would suggest that it is therefore well-worth the full 5 star rating.",1341964800,,3077,5.025490196078431
