174139,5,0976731096,"Just great! No advertisements. No disembodied hands. No hum. Starts off with the fire just starting, runs for two hours until the fire burns out and starts over again. Nicely framed. Great sound. (I didn't use the music) What more can you ask for? The bonus stream is ok but the fire is the draw.",1421280000,7,296,4.4
174140,5,0976731096,Absolutely enjoy this CD!  Very soothing and calming to watch while listening to music or reading!,1420416000,,98,5.125
174141,5,0976731096,"I just spent New Year's Eve watching this DVD at my sister's home and can say that it is the most realistic fire and sound effects of anything other than a real fire. While standing in front of the tv we felt like we were getting warm! My sister is gifting me with a DVD of my own so I will own it soon, and use it constantly Everyone who saw it loved it and felt it was completely realistic. The great part is that the sight and sound of watching a fire is so relaxing, and that feeling is not lost because it is on the television. One feels like they are sitting around a campfire in the evening...if I could give this ten stars I would.",1420070400,3,639,4.0
174142,5,0976731096,Great. Very realistic...Thank you.,1419984000,,34,7.75
174143,5,0976731096,"I concur with all the reviews of this item. Was very pleased it arrived in time for Christmas. Sooooo relaxing and realistic, right down to the snap. Crackle and pop. When the DVD ends, the fire starts over again, in about 5 seconds. No clean up of ashes or waiting for ashes to cool to be removed.  Best of all for myself personally, no asthma attack from smoke. Highly recommended.",1419379200,3,383,4.4714285714285715

174145,5,0976731096,"Great and realistic fireplace to relax too with your family, or yourself. Really helps bring the spirit of the holidays into your home. I found it very relaxing to lay down with a book and read while putting this DVD on. Great purchase.",1416960000,4,236,4.511627906976744
174146,5,0976731096,"Finally, I have found it: the perfect fireplace for my TV. This fireplace DVD sets a perfect atmosphere for the holiday season. Actually, it sets a perfect atmosphere for any time of the year. The logs burn for a very long time at a good pace. The best part is that the video starts over once it ends, so there is no need to restart it. Me and my friends are currently enjoying this video in our dorm room, since we don't have a fireplace in there. Nothing is better than spending a night in and playing cards around this fire. It sets the perfect atmosphere and is enjoyed by everyone on our floor. There are also other products by the same director that we enjoy, such as Aquarium for your home. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. I'm looking forward to playing this video many more times!",1416787200,7,811,4.377483443708609
174147,5,0976731096,"I enjoy it very much! I have the fireplace going and watch movies and TV on my IPad, or read or just sit and watch the fireplace. The music is lovely but I tend to watch with just the crackling of the fire. I have not watched the bonus yet but I'm sure it's beautiful too. I recieved my package on time and I will enjoy this for many winters, no doubt!!",1514505600,,353,3.9166666666666665
174148,5,0976731096,It's a simple cinderbrick fireplace with crackling wood burning.  Very warm and bright fire.  It's very soothing.,1514332800,,113,5.588235294117647
174149,5,0976731096,"I always enjoy watching log fires burn, and when local cable runs these during the holidays they're spoiled by two things: the camera angles zooming in and out, and the cheesy soundtrack selections someone else has chosen. With this DVD, it's just uninterrupted, single shot logs burning, complete with soothing crackling sounds, There is a music option soundtrack available, but I didn't try it. I'm happy with just the log fire burning. This is great!",1513468800,,453,5.053333333333334
174150,5,0976731096,I love the dvd!! Looks and sounds as if there is actually a fire in my living room. So soothing. And the extra mountain stream is wonderful. I love mountain streams so the added bonus was so nice!,1513382400,,196,4.184210526315789

174152,5,0976731096,This DVD is a great addition to my Living Room.  It has the crackling sound of a fire and mesmerizing flames continuously.  Love it !!,1511827200,,134,4.32
174153,5,0976731096,Great DVD! Great service!,1490140800,,25,5.5
174154,5,0976731096,"Works exactly as advertised.  Where we live in Hawaii there is no heating in the homes although the nights can get rather cool.  Running this DVD on a 60"" TV gives the illusion of greater warmth.",1486857600,,195,4.388888888888889
174155,5,0976731096,"This is a great fireplace video. Every Christmas, after New Year's, Xfinity takes away the Yule Log selection and I still yearn for it. I have tried a couple other fireplace videos, but they just didn't live up to the yule log. This one does. It looks like it's in a large fireplace with blackened, ancient cinder blocks in the interior, just like the yule log and it is an hour of fire from beginning to end, when it nearly consumes the logs. You can listen to just the fire crackling or some very pleasant music (not Xmas music) with the crackling. To me, it is perfect, exactly what I wanted.
There is no external fireplace or mantel showing, just the interior of the fireplace with the grate and logs and blackened blocks.
It's so peaceful and relaxing.
Then the bonus, rushing mountain stream video (a half hour) is really nice, too, so you have something for summer, as well.
I love this video. I hope I have described it in enough detail so that you can decide if it's what you want.",1485216000,,990,4.415300546448087

174157,5,0976731096,"Love this dvd, we think it's the best we've ever owned ... very realistic, runs forEVER; so relaxing to curl up with a book and a fire! We have a dvd for each of our 3 tv's! And the stream is wonderful in the summers! Great deal here, we love our fireplaces/streams!",1484524800,,266,4.134615384615385
174158,2,0976731096,"The constant popping is nerve wracking.  An occasional popping sound is one thing, but this sounds like an ammunition building exploding!  :(  Don't like this at all.  I would like to have something peaceful.",1483833600,,208,5.029411764705882
174159,5,0976731096,We are enjoying the dvd.  Exactly as described.,1482883200,,47,4.875

174166,5,0976731096,This is a great DVD. I absolutely love it. Just like a real fireplace. It crackles and snaps. I put it on at night and fall asleep watching the fire. Great buy!!,1458691200,,161,4.0625

174168,3,0976731096,"The overall experience is good.  The sounds are perfectly recorded, but the flames are overexposed - almost white.  If it weren't for the white flames this would be a perfect faux fireplace experience.  Being able to watch a wood fire from beginning to burning down is what we look for to create fireplace replacement entertainment.",1456876800,2,332,5.0
174169,2,0976731096,"You can watch what looks like the same thing as this Blu-Ray on Amazon Prime Video: http://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AOI5VAC/

Colors are blown out; center of flames are basically white

First quarter is just unlit naked wood lying around the flames, takes a while for it to actually catch

Intermittent pop sounds are way too loud and distracting

Isn't an unbroken shot; sometimes dissolves/fades",1453420800,2,393,5.39344262295082
174170,5,0976731096,"I took into account the other recommendations for this product when purchasing this Blu-Ray, and I was extremely pleased. It was exactly what I expected, and the price was right. The disc played just fine, and the fireplace looked great on my 10-year old 40"" LCD TV. The bonus mountain stream program was also great to watch.",1452384000,,325,4.719298245614035
174171,3,0976731096,"I love this dvd for its current and realistic look, the crackling noises, and its continuing play.  The only thing I don't like about it, and since it's on continuously, is arrangement of the logs.  There are two logs side by side.  Not a natural look for a fireplace.",1450828800,3,268,4.428571428571429

174173,1,0976731096,"Video of fire is so overexposed it's hard to look at.  The shot is also badly framed, with space under the grate visible and the top of the fire cut off.  It's not worth returning because I have to spend money to ship it back.  If you have Uverse, you're better off just  recording the yule log on their Showcase channel.",1449360000,,321,4.213114754098361

174176,5,0976731096,"This is great! The sight and sound of a fire, without the migraine from the smoke. The wood appears to be actually burning down and sparks pop out. After it finishes, it automatically loops to play again, so it can be turned on and more-or-less forgotten. I haven't listened to the music option, so can't judge that, but frankly, I'm happy with just the fire sounds. And the bonus stream is nice - maybe use in summer.",1446854400,,418,4.441558441558442

7794758,5,0976731096,"This is so awesome..  The fireplace is very high definition and actually feels warm to me and the authentic cracklng sounds (just crackling,, nothing else) add to the feel. It's the fire and the crackling sounds and that's it.  No superfluous effects or sounds. I love how it loops and loops and loops with no handling of the remote to do it.  Perfect.

The one thing i didn't like so much was the option to have the fireplace with the music.  I'd like to choose my own music,, if at all.  Thanks.

Damn. That said this STILL gets 5 stars cause it does exactly what it's supposed to do and looks fantastic doing it.  The music accompanied fireplace is just an optional setting.",1520035200,,677,4.4471544715447155

7794764,4,0976731096,"I like the sound track with pops and fizzes. The image was good. I would prefer an image of a larger (wider) fireplace with longer logs (e.g., Cracker Barrel). However, this is satisfying. I like the music option and running water video. It must have been tough to decide on the music to use. I like Vivaldi but that is a personal preference. Overall, I am satisfied :)",1515801600,,369,4.4411764705882355
