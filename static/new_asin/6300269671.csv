288386,4,6300269671,"A 70's classic now seemingly forgotten.  Had always wanted to see it so I bought this.  There seemed like a trend in 70's movies in a kind of excess which this movie exemplifies.  A lot of action and wacky interchanges, fights, cars.  Alan Arkin yelling a lot.  I found myself thinking of the Lethal Weapon movies, but they are too predictable by comparison.  It came as a burnt dvd-r which is no problem to me, and I don't mind at all if it makes many movies available.  The physical nature of the disc has nothing to do with the quality of the data on it.  A little confused by the casting of Loretta Swit who is barely in the movie but whose name appears second.",1493164800,,665,4.264

It has a lot of action, car chases and it has a lot of comedy also.  But it also has a lot of scenes that it doesn't matter how many times I watch this.  That don't make sense.

288553,5,6300269671,What a great entertaining cop buddy movie this is. It stars Alan Arkin and James Cann as two San francisco cops out to nail and then protect a crime pin. These two bunglers seem to make a mess of everything they do and that makes this movie a laugh riot. There are laughs galore and plenty of teriffic car chases throughout. This flick is just as heavy on the action as it is on the comedy. I highly reccomend this to any fan of cop buddy pics. The movie is from 1974 and the audio video dvd transfer is superb. Hats off to Warner Bros for doing a top notch job on their dvd-r movies.,1401235200,,584,4.086956521739131
288554,5,6300269671,A great comedy that I was never able to find until I finally located it on Amazon. I used to live in the San Francisco Bay area and enjoyed seeing the familiar land marks. I wish the two stars would have made a sequel to this movie.,1394409600,,232,3.9574468085106385

I expected a poor quality DVD, I was wrong! The quality of this recording is excellent. But, alas, the plot, direction, acting, etc. is terrible. I am sure Alan Arkin & James Caan wince at the mention of this farce.",1379808000,,385,4.436619718309859

288561,3,6300269671,"I last saw this movie many years ago when it was first released and I had very fond memories of it as a very funny and irreverent buddy flick with lots of laughs.

I'm not sure if it's because I've aged or because the movie hasn't aged well but it was not really what I remembered. The humor was dark and very un-pc for this day and age and that's ok, that doesn't bother me, I knew it was such. But the movie just seemed to move very slowly, and a lot of things that I remembe as being a riot didn't really make me laugh at all this time around.

I still enjoyed the movie and it was fun to watch so many of the scenes that I remembered so fondly, the car going off the elevated highway, the shoot out in the dentist's office...

But overall it just didn't make me laugh like I remember it doing, like Start the Revolution without me still does, or Young Frankenstien does, it just fell flat.

If you have fond memories of this movie from your youth be prepared to be a little disappointed for it may not live up to them, it may not really be the movie you remember.",1378339200,2,1067,4.066666666666666

288590,5,6300269671,"This is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. One has to pay attention to the dialogue to catch all the humor, but it's worth the effort. I'd recommend this to anyone looking for a couple hours of laughter.",1375056000,,211,4.3

288594,4,6300269671,This is an old movie from the 1970's that I really like and couldn't find elswhere.  I found it on Amazon for a good price and recommend it if you want to see a funny cop movie.,1367280000,,177,3.7837837837837838

288598,5,6300269671,It took Cindy and I back that wonderful year of 1974 again and how great life was then. We enjoyed watching together back then and loved watching together now. It was like we were both 17 again. I love you more than ever Cindy.,1356912000,,227,4.181818181818182
288639,5,6300269671,"Freebie and the Bean, now here is a movie comedy / drama  call it what you will, its just totally entertaining
from the opening sequence to the final 30 seconds, I was totally captivated, the lead performances by Alan Arkin
and James Caan are magical, two deeply troubled and flawed human beings trying their best to do a thankless job!
whats so amazing about this movie is that there were no mobile phones or internet to use in their quest for justice,
and do you know what! their absence was hardly noticed, the car chases were as exciting as any that are done in todays movies,
all up a fabulous DVD that Warners should release generally, as a matter of interest, the widescreen video quality is excellent
as is the audio, this is testament to the master used, a laser vision version from pre dvd days, go and order it!",1349827200,2,822,4.48
288640,5,6300269671,"One of the most wildly offensive, wholly inappropriate, politically-incorrect productions ever made in the history of film. And it also happens to be one of the funniest movies ever created.

Quite honestly, a consistent Top Five Favorite in my library.

Tells the story of two completely divergent police detectives who are also best buds and steadfast partners.

The first, Detective ""Freebie"" Waters, played by James Caan. An obnoxious, twisted s.o.b. who sees the world as a series of gimme scams fulfilling his self-absorbed degenerate lifestyle. Acts of extortion and outright thievery done in order to facilitate a better life - for himself. The public? Oh yeah, them too. You know, as a by-product of a happier police detective. Ha!

The other, Det. Benito ""Bean"" Vasquez, proud Hispanic officer played by the timeless Alan Arkin - my favorite actor. He's trying hard to stand his ground against his morally bankrupt partner, but it ain't easy. Bean sees the injustices too. It's everywhere, but especially when the wealthy and powerful manipulate the system - allowing their crimes to be whitewashed and happily forgotten, while average people like himself have to answer to and for every petty infraction.

He's had enough and his twisted partner's rants and raves are beginning to make sense. Adopting a very similar sensibility to his character in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Catch-22/dp/B00005ASGC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Catch-22</a>': Might as accept insanity in an insane world.

They're going to cross the line, repeatedly if necessary, to stop criminals and their crimes.

Interestingly, neither officer is on the take and they never will be. In their eyes they're the good guys, they're the honorable stand-up guys. And you know what? In the context of this film and the times they were living in - circa 1974 - they're right.

Insanely funny as the fumbling pair perpetuate an incredible assortment of outlandish and ridiculously illegal stunts in order to take down one of the city's biggest criminals. Simultaneously delivering a defiant middle finger to the cream-n-sugar humps of the world.

Again, one of my all-time favorite movies.

Movie Note:

- It would be another&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-years-for-the-veteran-actors-to-reunite-on-screen/dp/B001GMAVGE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 years for the veteran actors to reunite on screen</a>. And even then, the moment was likely lost on most of the audience. However, fans of Freebie & The Bean were treated to one helluva moment as the pair once again stood side by side on the same stage - their knowing looks belying their hilarious past as two SanFran cops.

Personal Notes:

- If you're incapable of ungluing the 21st century rose-tinted PC spectacles from your mug, then this movie is definitely not for you.

- The irony of setting this in San Francisco only makes this film that much more enjoyable. Reminds me a bit of a scene in the hilarious Neil Simon film '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Seems-Like-Old-Times/dp/B00005V5NS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Seems Like Old Times</a>' as Charles Grodin's attorney general character is advised that, ""California is a very conservative state"" which was true at the time of filming - so it plays as utterly bizarre and hilariously anachronistic some three decades later.",1343865600,,3436,5.724950884086444

LOL...much of it. Wish they could team up one more time. The motor cyle part...where Mr. Cann is chasing the bad guys in a van..was non other then the Great & late Stuntman...DAR ROBINSON. He was also the stunt person for Mr. Mel Gibson in the first ""Leathal Weapon"" movie..when he jumped off the building. People might think this movie as stupid,dump  IT is......But HEY..compare to today's REAL DUMP MOVIES being made...This is a classic for the 1970's. I surely haven't during this new century seen anything call a ""MIGHT BECOME CLASSIC"".Today it's all KILL,KILL,BLOW UP PEOPLE...Crash Cars. It's becoming ""OLD HAT""junk! Cann & Arkin really love each other as parners..it's just that at the same time..they hate each other for what they believe in. The movie for me is a BIG HIT.It's in WIDESCREEN....and it's very entertaining so many years later. Can you imagine them today with cell phones And stuff..They would be so great.

Way ahead of its time with script (still funny) and with part of the subject-matter (gay, maybe trannie, villain).  The action is low tech and slapstick but not outmoded, but it's the script and the main performers' (esp Alan Arkin's) delivery that have real holding power.  Very quick and funny.  The only old cop movie I personally know of that has a script that has held in this way:  way ahead of its time.",1285545600,,502,4.472527472527473

I fully appreciate that parts of this film would today be deemed politically incorrect,but come on it is only a film and it is 36 years old,and alot of things that were exceptable in 1974 are not accepted now. The on screen chemistry between James Caan and Alan Arkin really works .As a whole the films is just a real blast,you can see where some of the ideas for other buddy cop movies come from. Having read some of the other reviews my thoughts are that some previous reviewers need to lighten up and remember it is only a movie that is 36 years old.

The way the plainclothes officers conduct their business makes one wonder if they ever heard of Miranda.  A criminal waste of talent.

Yes... I'm jumping on the bandwagon with this one! This review is NOT of the movie or DVD, but of the seller(s). I bought this from WBshop yesterday for $19.95 + shipping and tax. Total cost for me was $26.30. I also placed it in my Amazon Shopping Cart. Today I look in my cart and got this message...

""Important Messages
Please note that the price of Freebie and the Bean has increased from $25.99 to $28.98 since you placed it in your Shopping Cart.""

WTF!! This is ridiculous!!
Since I'm a PRIME Member, I get free 2 day shipping, but still pay tax. So yesterday the total cost to me would have been $28.07.  Today it would be $31.30  I'm so glad I bought it from WBshop and many thanks to previous reviewers for their comments!! I can understand those of you outside the USA who would like to have this DVD... it's a shame you need to get ripped of from sellers like this.",1250640000,7,932,4.2727272727272725
288693,5,6300269671,"Well I like this movie. I have fond memories of seeing this as a young man at a drive in theatre in Australia and loving the excellent car chase action.... from a time before CGI and modern ever present 'shakey camera techniques'. The action has the realistic style of Bullitt, The Seven Ups, The French Connection, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry,.... although this one is an ACTION COMEDY (think Lethal Weapon I guess). The film is locked in the '70's with a lot of racial slurs and swipes at gay people (well before political correctness took over). This dates the film pretty badly and some of the attitudes of the characters will certainly grate with a modern audience. However, it's a fun movie with a great chemistry between the two lead characters. There's something about the look and feel of these gritty old cop shows from the '70's that you just can't get these days.

The problem is that Warner's only sell this movie through their direct market WB Archive Online shop (for $19:00 US$). They will not ship outside the USA (which doesn't help me in Australia) so the rest of the world is stuck with paying double the price from resellers such as here at Amazon.

I'd love to add this dvd to my collection but thus far I'm resisting being ripped off here and hoping Warner Brothers will stop shooting themselves in the foot and let the rest of the world buy their products too. Perhaps Amazon could find a way to stock this film for regular sale themselves..... but this reseller price is way too high.",1246320000,7,1504,4.587360594795539

288743,5,6300269671,This is a very popular movie that we all still enjoy.  When is it going to be out on DVD??,1090972800,4,90,3.5
288744,5,6300269671,"Check this out:
Arkin plays a Mexican-American cop nicknamed ""Bean"" (I can see now why this movie didn't receive more promotion) who is smart about police work, but so dumb that he can't figure out that his wife is having an affair.  Bean believes that phalic-shaped vibrators are for facial massage only, ""because that's what the ads say,"" he remarks offhandedly to Freebie, played by Caan.
Caan plays Freebie, a white cop who, besides being terrifically cynical, is a two-bit con artist to boot.  Together, the two make a sort of fantasy partnership, incorporating some slapstick along with some dry humor along the way.
The characters aside, the minute details of the screenplay are the cogs that make this movie work:  Caan's spoken fanfare, ""Taaa Daaa!"", when the pair's car hits the ground after sailing over a moving railroad flatcar.  The way the two can't seem to get in sync during an interview with the city's police commissioner.  The nonchalance displayed by everyone when the two sail into the apartment of an older couple from a highway overpass.
I saw this at a local theatre after it was released, which was over 25 years ago.  In terms of humor, it's much more sophisticated than current films with similar themes that hammer home slapstick gags without any sense of subtlety.
In terms of being an action flick, it's not quite up to that genre, especially when compaired to ""The French Connection"",  ""The Seven Ups"", or ""Dirty Harry"", which were all films of that era.
Parts of the screenplay are somewhat weak, and don't exactly contribute to the overall story.  However, it is a very funny film that has held up very well over time.",1070928000,19,1652,4.812720848056537
288745,1,6300269671,"This movie is dying to get on DVD WIDESCREEN.A TRUE CLASSSIC and one of the best action comedy movies I have ever seen. The very many CAR CHASES in this movie out do ones like ""Bullit"" & ""French Connection"" BY FAR! Top notch stunt driving. This is the movie Richard Donnor stole to make ""lethal Weapon"". James Cann plays the crazy over the top (not overly serious suicidal though) rough cop, and Alan Arkin plays his more relaxed partner. The acting and chemistry between these two great actors is simply outstanding and comical. My ONLY PROBLEM WITH THE MOVIE IS: that whoever put this on VHS Video should be ashamed of himself. It is in standard VHS FULL SCREEN FORMAT that is the absolute worst transfer I have ever witnessed to VHS. Not the picture (the color, ect. is ok), the full screen zoom is the problem and that  it's NON Pan & Scan, and throught the entire movie the viewer is treated to senceswhere nothing is in view and zoom up close ups of everything of nothing. WIDESCREEN version is BADLY NEEDED for this movie to be shown correctly or atleast a professional pan & scan copy for vhs. I CAN'T WAIT UNTILL THIS MOVIE IS PUT ON DVD IN IT""S WIDECREEN GLORY and I can view it the way it was when I seen it in the movie theatre when it was first released. Even when on very rare occassion they show it on tv, it is still this bad VHS full screen version that in my opinion is not worht even watching because you DO NOT see much of what is going on and with all the action and stunts the viewer really misses a great movie. See it on this VHS ortelevision and it's like watching a bad movie. See it the way it was intended and anybody (guys anyways) should think this is one of the best cop-action-comedy movies ever made.

288747,2,6300269671,"I think I saw a different movie that the other reviewers. The ""Freebie and The Bean""
I saw was at best a routine 70's buddy cop film. There's now way it can be the best Buddy-Cop movie ever
with French Connection and Lethal Weapon (2&1) out there. Sure it had some standout stunts and
moments ie. The Hillbilly in the Hotel Scene, the Kitchen Fight and the Apartment Crash but the
confusing, non stop ""buddy cops who argue but love each other anyway"" banter got tiresome
after a while. The banter is a standard in all buddy-cop flicks but, in this one, you realise just how annoying
it can be. And that carnival score...Yeesh!! Talk about killing the mood. I found myself
waiting for the camera to swing over to a bunch of clowns climbing out of a Volkswagon.
The title song too is atrocious and forgettable. Something funky and playful ala the Barney Miller
theme might have worked better. The film leaned towards being a spoof but
kind of got stuck somewhere in the middle. On the plus side, it has that ultra-violent,
politically incorrect style that will appeal to any fan of 70's action cinema (like myself). After 1976,
movie and TV show violence cooled down a notch so, in that aspect, Freebie and the Bean is vintage and
worth viewing (if you like that sort of thing).",1010620800,,1276,4.552173913043478

Despite it's age it still manages  not to be dated. Although it isn't totally PC it reflects how people were  and still are. Gay people are still called fags, Caan's racist remarks to  Arkin are just between two friends and don't have a real meaning. Some of  it is incoherent but this, along with the other flaws are nothing compared  to the superb acting talent and script. Arkin and Caan complement each  other perfectly and there are nicely acted supporting roles especially from  Bean's wife played by Valerie Harper.
