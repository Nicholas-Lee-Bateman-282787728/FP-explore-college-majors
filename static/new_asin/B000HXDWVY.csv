8142379,4,B000HXDWVY,"This was a good example of Goebbels Propaganda Mach. Definitely Pro_German. Our British Brothers&Sisters were referred to as ""EVIL MURDERERS of women and children.. The Germans don't mention the Nazi Massacre in conquered lands. I think they were also careful about not showing the planes the RAF shot down.  This is what Germans saw and believed.",1519084800,,347,5.196428571428571
8142380,1,B000HXDWVY,"Very annoying English narration by someone sounding like he is presenting a High School paper in class. Very distracting at times. Newsreels available elsewhere online without the narration. Comes across as one of those U.S. propaganda films issued by the army. The ones to ""explain"" the war to the folks back home and buck up domestic moral and support.",1517011200,,354,5.016949152542373

8142382,1,B000HXDWVY,"'Another view of the war'... 'military targets detailed'... 'a good overview'.

But today, in our improving world, only these few pathetic losers remain who find the Nazi ever-war romantic.",1391731200,,189,5.517241379310345
8142383,4,B000HXDWVY,"Vol. 4. 1940 Part 2. In everything I've seen, the Bombing of London is portrayed as an attack on civilians. Here we see the military targets along the Thames diagramed in detail. That puts a different perspective on it.

Social Psychologist Elliot Aronson said it is propaganda if you don't like the message, but education if you do like that same message. This is a different view of the war. I was moved to see all those troops marching to the Brandenburg Gate in 1940, with women throwing flowers at them.

Take a good look at these men, I said to these women--In 2 or 3 years, they will be buried in unmarked graves in Russia. I liked the scene with the lost shoe. It reminded me of Leni Riefenstahl's direction. Don't miss the brief scene where they show the 3 types of Volkswagens.

The subtitles are not perfect: 'The Labor Corps is building in the Warteland, not the ""Wasteland.""'

The narrator could have used a class in German 101. I've never heard ""Gauleiter"" pronounced as a French word.",1368576000,,999,4.564245810055866
8142384,4,B000HXDWVY,"To begin with, a caveat emptor for this and every other title in this series---if you dislike having to read subtitles while you listen to a German-language soundtrack, don't bother buying this. The English-language soundtrack consists of a British narrator reading the subtitles and trying to sound like he thinks an English-speaking Propaganda Ministry announcer would sound; it's really bad and gets old after a minute. Sir Laurence Olivier this guy is not! You're much better off reading the subtitles and listening to it auf Deutsch, even if you don't understand German.  Furthermore, the Germans made good use of sound in their newsreel footage---if they didn't have weapons firing, machines humming or boots marching there's a lot of music filling the sound between the German narration. If you listen to the English soundtrack to this episode, all of the sound is mixed down and the English narration laid atop it and the effect is completely lost.
Also, Part One of every episode is a five-minute history of Hitler and the rise of the Nazis using a lot of still shots; there's nothing in it you don't already know if you're not a novice on twentieth-century Germany.
This episode has a pretty wide mix of subjects, beginning with the Wehrmacht's victory parade in Berlin after the fall of France. There's some coverage of the Battle of Britain, but it doesn't give one the feeling that that contest was as epochal as it really was, which is to be expected since it was the first defeat Hitler experienced. You see more non-combat footage in this episode than you might expect, but after all, the German Army was taking a breather and only the Navy and Luftwaffe were in action.  The Reich Labor Service is shown hard at work in occupied Poland (the district of Wartheland is spelled in the subtitle as Wasteland!), you witness the embryo stage of the building of the Atlantic Wall, and there are parades and more parades. There's also footage from Italy's pathetic offensives in southern France and Egypt, the German Navy in action, and some of Europe's neutral states, such as Hungary, Bulgaria and Spain (although the subtitles destroy the name of Franco's Foreign Minister Serrano Suner not once but twice). Of the first four episodes of this series, this is easily the best and most varied, and heartily recommended.",1304208000,,2329,4.923664122137405
8142385,5,B000HXDWVY,This DVD goes beyond what is normally shown on tv.  It brings to the viewer a deeper understanding of what war was really like.  A must for any WWII collector.,1236988800,,159,4.266666666666667
