1803557,5,B00007AJG3,"First thoughts...Nicely done. But...not as good as the first one. Here's the breakdown.

1.  Directing--Very good. I liked the kind of quick-cut filmmaking from Lee McConnell.
2.  Script--Good writing from Jeff Rank. There is some cheesy dialogue, but it's not that bad.
3.  Acting--You've got William Zabka back, and he's my favorite character in this movie and the first one.

Now for the content review.
Rated R for language and creature violence.

1.  Sex/Nudity=0/10.
2.  Violence/Gore=4/10. It's not as violent as the first one but the snakes still eat quite a few people.
3.  Language=8/10. Worse than the first one. 22 F-words and other profanities.

Final thoughts...Overall 5/5. I liked it, but it's not as good as the first one. Highly recommended to fans of the genre or people who have seen the first one.",1292889600,,818,4.992592592592593
1803558,3,B00007AJG3,"Its an OK low budget sci-fi horror film but it does not have much to show off. The FX are average and the acting is a little below par. The story is ok, good enough to be made. but its a grain in the beach of terror films.",1210550400,,222,3.6458333333333335
1803559,2,B00007AJG3,"What the world needed was another movie starring a giant acid-spewing snake. Thank goodness the producers brought us ""Python II"". In this tenuous sequel the snake is in a secret US cargo plane that is shot down over Chechnya for reasons that remain unclear. After it begins attacking a Russian military installation CIA agent Greg Larson (Billy Zabka) recruits several Russian thugs and a couple of smugglers (who happen to be married) to assist him in retrieving the snake, which has been fiendishly bioengineered.

Unfortunately the snake does not cooperate with their plans, and mayhem reigns on the base. The movie has many features that do not recommend it: the pointless flashbacks, the seemingly endless credit sequence (which was lengthened at the last minute to give the film a marketable running time), numerous continuity issues, and really, really bad CGI effects. I was especially amused when the snake spit what looks for all the world like Silly String on one of the victims (it was supposed to be acid). The only set of flashbacks that have any purpose at all are the ones linking Zabka with the first ""Python"". I actually felt bad for Zabka here: he actually can act, and his talents are squandered on this.

Amusing contrivances abound. The female smuggler gets blinded in the underground Russian complex, yet she is the one sent via a labyrinthine series of air conditioning ducts to the surface to get the explosives the professionals forgot to get out of their truck. Just think about this: they had a blind woman crawl through ducts, avoid the giant snake, run to the truck, get the explosives, and return while fighting the snake off with a pistol. To top it all off (remember she's blind) they make sure to give her a flashlight to help her navigate the ducts. In one final blazing continuity gaffe, they show her falling out of a duct, ending in a field, where she can then get to the truck. How do you fall out of an underground duct and wind up at ground level? Oh, never mind...

The CIA turns out to be (of course) an evil organization, and with a cavalcade of explosions, running, and constricting snakes, the smugglers escape the compound at exactly the same time that US stealth fighters start bombing the facility. As they vow to start a new life together, we can only hope (out of a fear of ""Python III"") that it will be decidedly less snake infested.

This movie gets two stars for Zabka's performance alone. The remainder of the film is decidedly amusing if you enjoy ridiculous B-movies, but if you are looking for a seriously suspenseful or scary movie, this will not likely be for you.",1208736000,3,2624,4.735229759299781
1803560,5,B00007AJG3,"A review of python II by Jarrett Suhr
The first one set the town of ruby into a panic. In python II another plane charging another  giant smaller mutated snake is shoot down  while fly over Russian territory. The snake is loose and wipes on an entire Russian base  with only its head of the base survives the first on slaughter. As a result we have not one but two 80 foot to tong snakes are lost. Enter agent Larson who is sent to retrieve the DNA. Agent Larson is the cop that was in the first python if you did not see it there also is a flash back showing him getting excepted into the FBI. Larson  recruits to Russian citizens to hale a cargo which is not revealed right away back to the united states. All hell breaks loose again. With more fire fights and more fantastic creature violence makes it even better than the first one can they put a stop two this second incursion of mutated snakes find out in the thrilling conclusion.  If you like this I also recommend boa, Anaconda ,Anacondas Hunt for Blood orchid, Lake placid, and King Cobra.",1199232000,2,1049,4.331632653061225

1803562,3,B00007AJG3,"I really loved Python 1 after I bought it, so I ordered Python II off of amazon and it was great!  It's not as entertaining and definetly not as funny as the first Python, but it's still fun to watch.  Greg Larson(William ""Billy"" Zabka) returns in Python II as Agent Larson on a mission to capture another large snake that has again escaped due to an airplane crash.  This time around the battle rages on in Russia.  I wish there were some more special features on this disk, a commentary would be cool.",1091750400,3,503,4.376344086021505
1803563,1,B00007AJG3,"Okay, we open with this brother American army dude telling these Russain soldiers what their mission is:  capture (not kill) a huge python that somehow got thrown out of a plane and landed in Russia?  Then we have this big fight scene where we hardly ever see the snake; unfortunately, with the major supporting cast being Russian or something, we can't hardly ever understand what they are saying.  Then, when they load the snake onto a plane, some Russian rebels for no apparent reason shoot the plane down and the snake ends up in a Russian laboratory.  Next we meet Dana Ashbrook as an American ex-baseball player who is now running a transport service with his Russian wife.  They meet the irrepressible William Zabka as some kind of American dude who hires them to transport something (obviously the snake)...from here on, it's simply a matter of chasing and dodging the snake(s)---where did the other one come from!  Whew!
Here's the bottom line:
STORY:  Miserably constructed; the ex-baseball player obviously hit somebody so hard with one of his pitches that he is now paralyzed?  Oh, boy!  Score: 0
CAST:  Poor William Zabka.  This guy has played bad since his debut in KARATE KID, and it's a shame.  He has a tough guy, yet boyish good looks, but he always plays the butthole.  Let's give him a movie where he is the hero for a change.  Dana Ashbrook of FALCON CREST has always been one of those actors who manages to constantly annoy me; his scene where he throws the bomb into the snake's mouth is one of the funniest scenes I've witnessed in a horror movie; come on!  The rest of the cast is Russian, so who knows if they were any good or not.  SCORE:  2 (for Zabka only).
TECHNICAL:  Poor, to say the least.
DIRECTION:  What?  Did somebody helm this movie?  SCORE:  0",1078963200,,1782,4.60828025477707
1803564,1,B00007AJG3,"I can't solemnly swear that I actually watched all of Python II, rather after ten minutes I screwed around on amazon.com etc and just listened to the dialogue and checking out the screen every 30 seconds or so.
Do I really need to tell you that plot (involving, *gasp* the military!) is simplistic contrived and lame? That it will find inconsequential characters in the bowels of a facility? That we learn most of their names when they die and another character screams ""Mike! NOOOOOOOOOOO!""? That the special effects on the covor are about as good as the ones in the film? That the dialogue is like listening to a parrot strapped into a cuisinart? Or that the score uses snare drums when the military men appear? Or that there is not an iota of tension, fear or humor?
I mean, c'mon... the film is called PYTHON II (do I need to tell you that the roman numeral 2 is actually a pair of red slash marks?)
It's worse than Carnosaur.....
It's not however, the worst film ever made. It isn't offensive, just jaw-dropping, shockingly, mind-bogglingly awful, and an utter waste of time.
By the way, if you and your buds are looking to get drunk and make fun of a bad horror film for kicks don't come near this... I recommend JEEPERS CREEPERS 2 for that",1078012800,6,1246,4.517699115044247
1803565,3,B00007AJG3,"The best thing about this sequel is probably that we don't have Casper Van Diem's fake southern accent from the first movie.
What we do have is an operation to take an 85-foot 12-ton python from a cave in Russia to the US.  This is to be done by an American officer leading Russian troops.  They are pretty successful but are then shot down (no, I don't know why).
Then, a failed baseball player and his Russian wife who run a shipping company, run afoul of one of their accounts only to be rescued by a mysterious American (sure looked and sounded Russian to me).
Turns out he is the cop from the first movie.  He needs their truck to pick up some cargo from a crash.
Meanwhile, at a Russian army base, a box about seven feet by three feet by four feet supposedly has the title creature in it.  Well, they open it and the snake comes out.  In one scene there is more sake sticking out of the bow then the box could hold (yeah, right!).
Soon we have tense scenes of our heroes and the snakes (did you say 'snakes'?) running around the caverns of the base.  It all works out in the end but we never find out why there was more than one snake.
We also never find out what the python was doing in a Russian cave.  If it was genetically created, how did it get there?  This and other questions are never answered.
One good aspect was that a lot of the snake scenes had the snake off-camera, thus allowing for better suspense and a savings in CGI.",1059091200,,1442,4.199275362318841

7974548,3,B00007AJG3,"Only one returning character for this entry in the Python series (Billy Zabka as agent Greg Larson).  The new wardrobe doesn't help him much, nor does his new assignment.  He needs someone to haul `some' cargo and picks a couple of nitwits for the job.  The cargo in question has been hither and yon, before it escapes its confines and does a bit of mischief in a small isolated Russian military base.  Before you can say, ""Where is everyone,"" it's too late.  The snake in the box isn't...........and there are now two of them.

I wish I could say this is the Hamlet of snake movies but it isn't.  It's more like Much Ado About Nothing.  This movie could definitely have used a lot more of everything: better actors, better dialog, a better story, more explosions, more carnage.............  But as is, with no discernible improvements, it's just your basic BIG snake(s) run amok.  It's entertaining on a certain level but that's about it.",1410048000,,939,4.705521472392638

7974552,5,B00007AJG3,python 2. I order both movies and some ore that are like it. i enjoy older movies and not so much the new age one.,1359158400,,114,3.6
7974553,2,B00007AJG3,"I bought this film on Amazon with the first Python and bought blindly. This film is not really bad as it is boring. The movie is about a plane crashing somewhat close to the first one. I watched this right after I watched the first Python and was disappointed. The cast of the film is nowhere close as good as the first one with Billy Zabka returning in it(this time a bad guy) but still the same charecter as the first one. The two main good guys are played by Dana Ashbrook and Simmone Jade McKinnon. If you do not watch Syfy original movies or direct to DVD films you will not know who these people are but since I watch b movies I know who they are. Once again the cast fails in bad acting and no name actors.

The films CGI is a little better than the first one but CGI no matter what the budget is the CGI gets better by the year and this being made two years later than the first one. With the first one it kept me in it and I was not bored but this one is very boring and kept me looking at the time on the DVD player for how much time is left. That is the negative of the film and here goes the positive: the attacks or somewhat good and that's about it. I paid $5 for it and wished I bought another DVD but I originally bought this because I bought Boa vs Python in a 4 film collection and decided to collect the whole series including Boa, Python, and this film which I have completed.

My advice do not buy or do not rent on Netflix unless you want to be bored.",1344124800,,1473,3.972972972972973
