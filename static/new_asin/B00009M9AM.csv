7991307,1,B00009M9AM,"I was very desapointed when i saw the documentary. I was expecting something nice and beautiful like the amazon tribes are. But, it seams like it was done by people who want to make the audience believe that the Brazilian Indians are very unhappy with the country. Everybody knows about the bad influence of the religious groups in the Amazon forest. They are trying to evangelize the Indians like they are lost and in need of some salvation. That is very inappropriate. During the entire documentary the indians talk like they are not Brazilians at all. And some of them say hate things about "" Brazilians"". Who are supporting those religions?",1514764800,,644,4.8108108108108105
7991308,4,B00009M9AM,I borrowed my roommate/friend's DVD the other night and have to say this is a great documentary. I would give it 4 1/2 stars if I was able to. The previous bad review is obviously sour grapes and should be ignored. I am going to buy this DVD very soon as I have to return the one I watched to my friend soon.,1198713600,,308,3.9047619047619047
7991309,5,B00009M9AM,"I've used this video in the first week of introductory anthropology courses for several years and am really happy with it -- it concisely touches on a wide array of ethnographic material on topics like kinship, the division of labor, ritual, rites of passage, subsistence, indigenous peoples' relations to nation-states, and cultural and economic change.  Most importantly, it breaks down the idea that change is a simple movement from ""tradition"" to ""modernity,"" by focusing on two different Kayapo groups who are actively debating what it means to be Kayapo, & what kinds of change are acceptable.  Nearly every concept that comes up in later weeks in the course can be illustrated with a reference to some aspect of this film, & students seem to remember it. Highly recommended.",1189036800,10,781,5.09375
7991310,1,B00009M9AM,he posted his own promotional photo on our Amazon website which had the address of his own website and misrepresented the Indian tribe from our film - then he negatively reviewed our DVD to promote his own DVDs - so this is not an ethical man and based on this behavior I would not be surprised if his anthropological films were staged,1165190400,2,335,4.419354838709677
7991311,3,B00009M9AM,"It's difficult to find entertaining, authentic videos on Amazonian Indians and this one is better than average.  I know, as I am currently producing Amazonian Indian documentaries.  I have another video on the ""Ritual of the Flutes"" made by brazilian anthropologists that is really boring despite the incredible subject material.  Nice to see something that's entertaining.",1157414400,5,373,5.625
