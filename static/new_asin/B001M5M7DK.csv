8320521,2,B001M5M7DK,"When I purchased this dvd, I thought I was purchasing a dvd displaying the original Dramatics -- I especially thought that Lenny Mayes would be on this one even though it showed the Dramatics in later years, but he was not.  This dvd is a sad remembrance of the once-famous Dramatics -- Ron Banks could not even hold a note anymore, much less sing!  He was shown on the dvd HOLDING ON TO AND LEANING AGAINST THE MICROPHONE while the others were trying to sing and dance because he was out of breath and could not keep up!  Sadly, he died one year later -- he shouldn't have been singing in this dvd (in 2009)-- you could clearly see that he was out of shape and out of the loop! They all looked like they had not saved their money and had been on the streets, drinking and drugging it for years.  Overall, their performance was a ""D"" to say the least.  The once-famous Dramatics' songs are too special to have displayed this dvd to the world, showing the the aged replacements and the out-in-the-streets original singers that are left.  This dvd should not have cost any more than $2.99 even though I paid $17.99 for it because their songs were so wonderful.  Please don't bother wasting your money on this dvd.  If you want to remember the Dramatics, I would suggest that you continue to listen to their old albums and CDs and catch their tunes on your local radio station.  I'll give it two stars ""just because.""",1306281600,,1414,4.428571428571429
8320522,5,B001M5M7DK,"I'm a fan of 70's music. So naturally I've been a fan of the Dramatics for years. I was very excited to find the concert dvd of them. And I definitely wasn't disappointed. In fact I watched it 3 times the first night. I'm a sucker for bass singers so of course I love Willie ""Sugar Bear"" Ford. And L. J. Reynolds still sounds great. If you're a 70's soul fan this is one for you.",1289260800,,379,4.0
8320523,5,B001M5M7DK,"I have a large collection of live performances and this is one of the best, visually and sound quality.  The song selection was great and it was a full performance.  The bonus interviews and background scenes gave an additional dimension to the pursuit of quality behind the performance.  Sadly, Ron Banks is no longer with us, so this video is far more meaningful.  In 2009, I drove from upstate New York to Westbury, Long Island to see the Dramatics.  The brought the house down, but special because that would be the last time seeing Ron Banks.  Thanks so much.",1286668800,,564,4.646464646464646
8320524,5,B001M5M7DK,"This is pure masterpeice
I voted it a 4 after the 1st 3 times I listened to it
by the 5th time I gave it 5 stars I had my headphones on and could really here it, man a tear came in my eye.
I sure long for this type of lyrics and instrumentation, the vocals were great.
LJ stood out as always, the late great Ron Banks was a little off, key in places
but I loved it regardless, if you are lucky enough to find a copy buy it

8320525,4,B001M5M7DK,"As noted in my prior reviews, I have been a music collector for the past 30 years, especially classic music, and this includes classic video performances by legendary artists, which are very hard to find because most of the ones available are very poor in quality due to a lack of restoration/conversion.  In this case, the Dramatics concert is of relatively good quality in picture and sound (unless you are an audio/video tech fanatic),and the group performs literally all of their greatest hits, although some in a melody format because they have so many hits.  The concert itself is actually very good if you like the Dramatics.  I attended several of their live concerts and this is not a bad representation at all.  Of course they are somewhat older, and all artists lose some vocal ability in time, but overall they are in pretty good voice for their ages.  That said, I would recommend this concert for any true Dramatics fans, as it is likely the last good performance you will find, and I think it is a nice addition to my vast collection of classic music!",1255046400,17,1066,4.679144385026738
8320526,5,B001M5M7DK,"This is my favorite DVD.  I can't stop watching it.  The performances are faaantastic.  I only hope that there will be another Dramatics DVD.  This DVD has made me a Dramatic fan for life.  If anyone is on the fence trying to decide whether to buy or not to buy this DVD,  I strongly suggest that you purchase it.",1249257600,8,313,4.220338983050848
8320527,3,B001M5M7DK,I don't know. Some groups like The Dramatics and The Delphonics need to give it up. They can't sustain that magic that was once there. This was a disappointment.,1241740800,6,161,4.586206896551724
