7791424,5,079074032X,"Youve got to love the limitations of VHS.  When TV dramas were sold two episodes to a tape, you sometimes wound up with some pretty strange breaks.  Thats certainly the case with the season one episodes of Babylon 5 collected here - Legacies and A Voice in the Wilderness Part 1.  Fortunately, with the advent to DVD, this becomes a non-issue.

Babylon 5 is a space station located in neutral territory and designed to be a port of trade as well as a UN of sorts to help create peace among the various races.  Of course, as we learned over the five year course of the story, that peace doesnt come without conflict and a very high price.  The first season built the story slowly while mainly introducing us to the races and characters wed spend the rest of the show with.  As such, the episodes can be hit or miss.  But these two are both good ones.

First, we have the stand alone episode Legacies.  As is often the case in the season one episodes, we have two storylines happening.  In the first, the body of one of the great Minbari military leaders is being paraded around the galaxy on its way to be buried on Minbar.  However, when it arrives on Babylon 5, it mysteriously vanishes.  With not only Ambassador Delenn (Mira Furlan) but warrior Neroon (guest star John Vickery) demanding answer about this outrage, Commander Sinclair (Jeffery OHare) and Security Chief Michael Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle) have to act fast to find answers before a second war between their species breaks out.

And in the second story, a young teen girl suddenly develops telepathic abilities.  Unfortunately, it happens while both Lieutenant Commander Susan Ivanova (Claudia Christian) and resident telepath Talia Winters (Andrea Thompson) are present, and the two immediately start fighting over the girls future.

While both stories in this episode stand on their own, they both fit very nicely into the overall story and universe building of the first season.  With the telepath story, we learn a bit more about how other species treat their telepaths.  And we see Talia and Ivanova again class over the PsiCorp.  Yet their relationship is softening, and its a subtle transition you can watch as the season progresses.

Meanwhile, the first Earth Minbari war ended 10 years ago, therefore 10 years before the series started, but much of why and how it ended is still shrouded in mystery.  This episode gives us a chance to see the conflict a bit more from the Minbari side of things.  Those hoping to find out why the Minbari suddenly surrendered won't find that information here, but they will find some intriguing clues as to what really happened.  More revealing is the growing split on Minbar that resulted from the end of the war, something we hadnt heard about before and would come into play in later seasons.

Which brings us to A Voice in the Wilderness Part 1.  This episode finds Delenns old mentor Draal (guest star Louis Turenne) coming for a visit just as the planet the station orbits starts to have earthquakes and radiate beacons from deep within the planets surface.  Considering this was thought to be a stable, uninhabited planet, that worries everyone.  If the planet goes, it will take the station with it.  Meanwhile, the tension on the Mars colony erupts into violence, and Garibaldi uses every means he can find to try to learn the fate of his former girlfriend.

This is a hard one to discuss without talking about part two.  As I said, in the day of DVD, this isn't an issue because you can watch them back to back.  While this episode doesnt stand on its own, it does a great job of keeping you entertained.  This was not a one episode story stretched into two hours but a story that needed two hours to be told well.  And considering it does set up several key plot points for later seasons, it is not to be missed.

The acting on both Legacies and A Voice in the Wilderness Part 1 is good.  The actors have really settled into their characters and bring them to life well, whether it is some very serious stuff or moments of pure comedy.  There is a gag that has been set up all season that pays off here, and a hilarious scene involving Centari Ambassador Londo (Peter Jurasik) that are both laugh out loud funny.  Ivanova has some excellent lines as well.

The CGI is getting better, although you can still see how dated it is at times.  Remember, this was 1994, so Im willing to give it a pass because of that.

Once again, I don't recommend you track down this tape.  However, I do highly recommend both these episodes.  They start off disc 5 of the first season DVD set of Babylon 5.  Thats the way to watch them.",1429228800,,4633,4.598780487804878
7791425,4,079074032X,"Be forewarned that you only get ""A Voice in the Wilderness Part 1"" in this pair of episodes from the first season of ""Babylon 5"" and you can make up your own mind as to whether this bothers you or if you prefer the ""Farscape"" approach which puts episodes out of order so that you do not have to make two purchases to get both parts of a story.
Episode 17, ""Legacies"" (Written by D. C. Fontana, Aired July 20, 1994) begins with the station awaiting the arrival of a ship bearing the body of Branmer the Minbari general who led the attack in the Battle of the Line.  The Minbari cruiser is bringing Branmer's body back home and making stops so that people can pay their last respects.  The only problem is that when they open the casket for the viewing, Branmer's body is not there.  Meanwhile, Alisa Beldon (Grace Una), a young girl entering puberty, exhibits telepathic abilities, which means she either joins the Psi Corps or gets to be heavily drugged for the rest of her life.
The plotline about the missing Mindari body is the most important, because apparently Delenn (Mira Furlan) has something to do with what is going on (and the word ""chrysalis"" matters big time).  Commander Sinclair (Michael O'Hare) also has to deal with trash talk from the commander of the Mindari cruiser (John Vickery) in a sub-plot that has a nice resolution.  Of course while Talia Winters (Andrea Thompson) talks up the Psi Corps to young Alisa, Ivanova (Claudia Christian) is telling horror stories about what happened to her mother.  But when tests indicate that Alisa is at least a P10, she starts getting offers from the alien ambassadors.  The fighting over Alisa's future is an odd pairing to put with the other plot line, but the part of this episode that has me shaking my head is that the humans still do not know what it means when a Minbari vessel has its gun ports open.
Episode 18, ""A Voice in the Wilderness Part 1"" (Written by J. Michael Straczynski, Aired July 27, 1944) deals with upheavals.  While seismic activity on a planet near Babylon 5 reveals signs of an extinct alien civilization there is unrest on the Mars Colony that turns violent.  Meanwhile, Ambassador Delenn enjoys a visit from her old mentor, Draal (Louis Turenne), who bemoans how the Minbari people have lost their sense of purpose, and Garibaldi (Jerry Doyle) is getting frantic about making contact with his ex-girlfriend on Mars.
The Mars subplot has some importance, not because of Garibaldi's love life but because Earth is treating that colony with the same sort of disdain it shows Babylon 5.  But the main attraction here is the flickering image appears of an alien man pleading for help who appears to first Sinclair and then Londo (Peter Jurasik).  When Sinclair and Ivanova investigate the planet what they find raises even more questions (such as why the top two command officers of B5 are both out investigating a planet together).  Can another diplomatic crisis be far behind?",1082678400,,2962,4.7189922480620154
7791426,4,079074032X,"In ""Legacies"", the body of a deceased Minbari Leader who is going through B5 is stolen. The interesting part of this episode is the cultural differences of the various Minbari casts.
The other episode introduces us with the planet below B5 and the secrets it holds. This is a vital episode for the series and you need to see it to understand what goes on in the Shadow War.",983059200,,373,4.420289855072464
