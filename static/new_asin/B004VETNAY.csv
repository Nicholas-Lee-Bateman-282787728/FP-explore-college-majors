I had been wondering what makes Louisville a center of contemporary art music. (Well, I haven't found any connection with the Kentucky Derby yet!) It has an orchestra which commissioned and recorded many 20th century music I own, on the label First Edition for example. University of Louisville's School of Music has many world-class composers in its roster of (visiting) faculty. It holds the most prestigious international award for a new music score: Grawemeyer Award for Music Composition. This documentary tells an inspiring story.

First, the contents: This DVD box contains 2 discs. Disc one is for the main feature documentary by Owsley Brown III and Jerome Hiler, about 100 minutes in length. Disc two is a bonus disc consisting of more than 2 hours of extended interviews with composers, musicians and related personalities. There is a 22-page booklet, with a 10-page article by Jerome Hiler (one of the directors), as well as comments by Sandra Fralin, Justin Dello Joio (a composer, son of late Norman Dello Joio, composer and Pulitzer Prize winner) and Chou, Wen-chung (composer). Technically, this is NTSC Region-1 coded DVD (U.S. and Canada)(*), with the Dolby Digital sound track.

The main feature documentary tells a story of how Louisville managed to transform itself from a post-Great-Depression flood-devastated city to a center of new music. Along with interesting archival photo, radio and film footage, the film incorporates comments from living composers no less than Elliott Carter, CHOU Wen-Chung, Norman Dello Joio, Lukas Foss, Ned Rorem, Gunther Schuller, Joan Tower, Harold Shapero, among others. Carter, for example, gave an extensive interview (at the age of 100!) expressly for the documentary, recalling his experience of composing for Louisville a piece that remains one of his most popular: 1955's Variations for Orchestra, which is in Milton Babbitt's list of 6 greatest compositions in the twentieth century. The film music comes exclusively from the recordings of the commissioned works by the Louisville Orchestra. One can hear, for example, Malipiero's 3rd Piano Concerto, Carter's Variations for Orchestra and Schuller's 3rd Concerto for Orchestra ""Farbenspiel"", among others.

Get it. You won't be disappointed.

Highest recommendation.

(*) I strongly suspect that there is no region code on the DVD, but have no region-2 player to test on the conjecture. I got my copy from a UK online vendor for about $10 less, and it has NTSC Region 1 printed on the cover. I would be surprised if the company sells region-1 coded DVDs in the UK!",1350777600,7,2688,5.23953488372093

8443259,5,B004VETNAY,"Anyone who has wondered what happened to the pure documentary will be struck by the simple elegance and beauty of this scintillating film about an orchestra that pulled the city of Louisville, Kentucky out of the mire of a devastating flood to the forefront of contemporary music in mid-20th century America. The film is a feast of little known musical gems woven into a tableau of unforgettable images surrounding a tale as wild and exciting as any action picture.",1306800000,13,465,4.89873417721519
