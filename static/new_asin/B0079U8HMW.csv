8513031,5,B0079U8HMW,"This DVD is not Region 1 and therefore will not be playable in most DVD players available in the US.  Instead of complaining about it,  buy a Region-Free DVD player and solve your problem. They are not difficult to find.  I think Amazon sells one;  if not,  search the net for them.  They are readily available.",1490054400,,311,4.464285714285714
8513032,5,B0079U8HMW,"Great family movie. There is a scene where a character is shot in the bank. Plays in my blu-ray without any problems. The disc is in Italian and dubbed Italian, but you can select English from the menu.",1468368000,,202,4.342105263157895
8513033,5,B0079U8HMW,Amazing movie! Sadly it's not available in Region 1 so it won't play on US dvd players. But if it did I'd buy at least 5 copies as gifts because my little brother was a stunt double and it was filmed in our home town. I can't say enough about how good this movie is! Great story and perfect for all ages.,1453420800,2,304,3.9193548387096775

8513035,5,B0079U8HMW,Great acting in this adventure. Filmed on location in Utah.  Much better than made in Hollywood movies which I now avoid.,1427932800,2,121,4.761904761904762
8513036,1,B0079U8HMW,"I'd love it more if it came in our DVD region player.  Since it was filmed here in my home town and some of my friends are in it, you would think it would- but no.  Sad.",1419120000,2,169,3.5405405405405403
8513037,1,B0079U8HMW,Only works on a computer. I tried 4 different DVD players and got the same error message,1417305600,,88,4.235294117647059
8513038,4,B0079U8HMW,"The DVD is PAL, region-free, and did not have CSS, so it is likely a bootleg.  It is a good movie though.",1408406400,,105,3.772727272727273
