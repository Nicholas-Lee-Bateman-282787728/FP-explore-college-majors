7609721,2,B01ATCA3Y6,"I agree 100%.  I really wanted to like this show but two things killed it.  The first is what you mention.  None of the characters are likeable or relatable or whatever you call it that makes you care for them.  Yes there are a couple moments here and there but the characters are very forgettable.  In fact some aspects are downright horrible.  The torture scene is unrealistic and totally not necessary.  The solution to the problem at the hospital is that they (the main characters) unleash mayem on everyone, good and bad, for the chance to find 1 or 2 people.  Just didn't make sense and was in a way evil.  The best performance comes from the druggie son, especially in the first episode.  But he's a character that as the season progresses you almost want to get eaten because of the stupid choices he makes.

The second really big problem with this series is the plot/premise.  The idea is that we get to see the apocalypse ""AS IT HAPPENS.""  Wow, great, and the first episode or two do show it beginning.  With hints here and there and then more stuff happening.  Just as it gets to be intense the show totally cops out.  The next episode starts by saying ""9 weeks later.""  What?  9 weeks later?  Yup, it's all done.  They totally skip the ""As it happens"" and go directly to, it's a barren LA with a few zombies shambling about.  It's no different than how the Walking Dead did it, if you think about it.  Isn't Rick in a coma for like 2 months or something?  Whatever the case is, we don't see how the chaos ensues, we don't see how people are ripped from each other's arms.  We don't see the military confused and unsure what to do.  It's all discussed as happening off screen or during the 9 weeks.  Totally lame.

There are a couple good points and I do plan to watch it.  But unlike the Walking Dead I will not buy the Blu-ray of the season.  Just not worth it.",1453420800,16,1874,4.335260115606936
7609722,1,B01ATCA3Y6,"The problem with this series is that it never makes the viewer care -- at all -- about any of the characters.  In fact, if they killed them all and started over, it might be better, but I doubt it.  If this series makes it to a second season, that alone will be a major accomplishment.",1453334400,14,285,4.071428571428571

7609725,3,B01ATCA3Y6,"The big problem with this show is that it doesn't have a Rick, Daryl or Michonne (yet). I don't care about any of these people or what happens to them. It's breezy entertainment, but if a zombie horde were to surround and eat each and every main character here, I'd actually be relieved since there's a chance someone interesting might finally come along.

Solid Blu-ray release, but the show itself doesn't hold a candle to The Walking Dead. Maybe it'll eventually get into what Glenn and T-Dog were doing before they met Rick. Here's hoping, because these new characters suck.",1467504000,3,578,4.78
7609726,1,B01ATCA3Y6,This show flat out sucks. I have never watched a show with such a dreadful cast of characters. There is not a single likable character on the show. How they were able to create such an exceptional program like The Walking Dead only to follow it with this garbage is beyond me. Don't waste your time.,1464739200,6,299,4.357142857142857
7609727,1,B01ATCA3Y6,"So much potential wasted, fell down to the old formula ""retarded good guys vs. arrogant bad guys"" and ""everybody is living behind a wall/fences and some fool try to scape to bring some action to the script.",1463529600,,206,4.594594594594595
7609728,1,B01ATCA3Y6,"I love the show, but I have to give this set one star.  Releasing a special edition three months after the first version was released is a slap in the face to fans.  You couldn't have released this instead of the other set?  Do you expect me to drop another $35 to pick up this version?  I'll find them on YouTube or Pirate Bay. I tell you what, you complain about downloaders ruining the industry, but it's shady business like this that is driving paying customers away in droves.  I gave you my money. I willingly paid for this season and this is how you reward fans.  It's an insult and I won't be buying season two when it's released as I will just assume you will do the same thing again. You have paying customers who want to give you their money and yet you still find a way to screw us. Bootleggers aren't ruining the industry, your greed and lack of respect for your customers is.  For the record, season two has been outstanding, but I won't be buying it.",1462924800,26,965,4.269230769230769
7609729,5,B01ATCA3Y6,This was definitely worth the wait.  Has lots of extras.  Don't buy the first one that came out.  Get this one!  You won't be disappointed.,1462579200,3,139,4.44
7609730,1,B01ATCA3Y6,"Let me be clear. the one star is for price. The show is ok, nowhere near as good as The Walking Dead, but who would shell out 30-40 dollars for a season with ONLY 6 episodes! Won't buy until it is around $15.",1462492800,6,208,3.86046511627907
7609731,5,B01ATCA3Y6,This show is a perfect companion to The Walking Dead and sets itself apart from it as well. This show has meaningful characters and fantastic arcs to go along with them. I absolutely adore it!,1462320000,,192,4.514285714285714

7609734,5,B01ATCA3Y6,"The pacing was slow, but I enjoyed the dynamic between characters immensely. There's not a whole lot of action, but I didn't come from TWD fandom. I actually wasn't going to watch this at all because it didn't seem like my cup of tea, but after listening to my friends complain about it for weeks, I gave it a shot and found myself quite enjoying it. Disecting characters and their motives is one of my favorite things, so yeah. There's not a lot of action, but if you're into character driven family plots like me, you should definitely give it a shot.",1460678400,4,553,4.431372549019608
7609735,5,B01ATCA3Y6,*REVIEW OF SHOW NOT DVD SET SPECIFICALLY* Shows great just a slow build. It's not Rick & Daryl so people get twisted up. It's same universe but in So_Cal instead southern Georgia. So not same view point.taking place while Rick Grimes from main series is in a coma. So in few seasons they may bump into each other or people like Dale could pop up headed to Georgia who knows but am Bobby Kirkman,1460592000,,394,4.337837837837838
7609736,5,B01ATCA3Y6,"I'm not sure why people are rating this show so poorly because it is really good. The walking dead being in season 6 is sort of like a soap opera, while this show in its infancy is giving us a world which is being introduced to zombies all over again.
I started this show to get my fix while the walking dead was in its off season, but after watching all of season 1 and the premiere of season 2 I am starting to like this show much better.",1460246400,,440,3.955056179775281
7609737,2,B01ATCA3Y6,"Fear the Walking Dead: The Complete First Season Special Edition is a 2-disc Blu-ray release containing all 6 episodes from the AMC series freshman season. Though Season One was released previously, this Special Edition is chock full of bonus features that should please aficionados of the series and reveals lots of background details.

The show, like its companion zombie program The Walking Dead, is set during the undead apocalypse but its a prequel, taking the viewer through the factors that started the nightmare world of the reanimated dead. In Los Angeles, a mysterious outbreak threatens to disrupt the lives of high school guidance counselor Madison Clark (Kim Dickens) and English teacher Travis Manama (Cliff Curtis) and their family. The everyday pressure of blending two families while dealing with resentful, escapist, and strung-out children is pre-empted by a greater problem  societys sudden breakdown. A survival-of-the-fittest mentality takes hold, and the family must cope with a far greater threat than family discord.

Fans used to the driving pace of The Walking Dead might be put off by the long, often dull sequences of family squabbling, brooding teenagers, and not terribly bright decisions. Laying the groundwork for major characters is essential to establishing them for viewers, but it is hard to root for folks who have so little inherent appeal. The reason for focusing on a dysfunctional family is to show how they come together in a time of crisis, but shouldnt the first episode or two draw us in? Instead, they tend to showcase not very pleasant people in soap-opera fashion. The tendency is to root for the zombies  not what the creators intended.

Because the show deals with the onset of the zombie plague, there are opportunities to create suspense by doling out significant information over several episodes, but with such a disappointing opening, its tough to sustain interest. Episodes contain considerable padding, indicating theres probably not enough dramatic potential for two prime-time zombie series.

Bonus features include 5 deleted scenes; 7 making-of featurettes; audio commentaries on every episode; and 3D lenticular packaging. A digital HD copy is included.",1458604800,6,2215,5.350574712643678
7609738,1,B01ATCA3Y6,"I was waiting for a Bluray version that also included teh UV digital copy.  The first disk did not have it.  The price on this set is a joke though.  59.95 for 6 episodes.  Almost $10 Dollars each.

The show itself has potential but has failed to go anywhere in the first 6 episodes.  They did a poor job showing what was going on in the early stages of the epidemic instead focusing on an drug addict.  After 6 episodes the mass of people are turned but they really did not show any of it.

I will wait for the price to drop to a reasonable level for 6 episodes.",1458604800,7,563,4.054545454545455
7609739,5,B01ATCA3Y6,I love the concept of the show. the high school kid tobias who warned the main female character about the walkers was awesome. this series is still a lot better then what is being produced on any other networks. so I will be watching the 2nd season. it should get better.,1458172800,2,271,4.333333333333333
7609740,1,B01ATCA3Y6,"As a HUGE Walking Dead fan I really,REALLY wanted to like this show but what a huge disappointment it was.
From the unlikable characters ( which is amazing since I like most of the actors from other projects) to the utter bore-fest TPTB painted for the start of the Zombie Apocalypse, all you got was theater of the mind, characters huddled together peeping outside to flashing, lights, helicopters buzzing about, breaking glass or screams, the sound department should win an Oscar because you never actually get to SEE anything.
Sure it may have gotten the highest rated watch cable show or whatever but that was because it was piggybacking on the Walking Dead's success, it didn't get it on it's own merits, I'll bet season two doesn't get half the viewers coming back.
Anyhoo my suggestion is, don't waste your money.",1457049600,5,820,4.822695035460993
7609741,4,B01ATCA3Y6,"Is this The Walking Dead? No. The only similarity is it takes place in the same world and shares parts of its name. Other that that, Season One should not be compared to The Walking Dead. Travis is a dolt and my least favorite character, until the season finale that is when I believe the events that happened have woken him up. He will be a changed man in Season Two. The rest of the players have their ups and down and I can see potential parallels to The Walking Dead characters as they grow and are forced to change. We like our characters on The Walking Dead because we see how aware they are of the threat, how to survive, go on runs, take down walkers but would we have liked them if we met them during the ""Fear"" stage? Maybe some of them. Maybe none of them.

In Fear, we see a modern day family just trying to get through the day when inexplicable things start happening around them. Like most people would be, they are in denial of what's happening, put blind faith and trust in the government and military and are more than happy to let other people control things while they sit behind a fenced in town under martial law. The focus is on this one family (and the people that have been sort of adopted by them as well) and how they come to terms with society breaking down and less on the walker effect. Could they show downtown L.A. being overrun by walkers gnawing on people for six hours? Sure. But that's not where the ""fear"" really lies. The ""fear"" is, how do I get food, water, am I safe at home, do we stay, go, wait for help, do it on our own, what's really happening, is anyone in charge, and so on. When society collapses, the fear is not the visible decomposing flesh-eating former humans walking the streets. It is the fear in what can't be seen, controlled or known. Going into this show, that is what I anticipated and that was what I received. With that said, I cannot wait for Season Two!",1455667200,14,1916,4.2782369146005506
7609742,2,B01ATCA3Y6,Sooo boring and predictable. It's ok to watch on tv when Walking Dead is off the air. But not worth buying. The characters are not interesting enough to really get into and want to watch a second time. Just rent it if you're done seeing all the Walking Dead episodes. But if you want to see a plague event unfold watch The Strain instead. It explains much better how an infection would devastate a city and cripple the police.,1454112000,7,426,4.405063291139241

 season 1 current version has almost no extras but a few minutes of the introduction to the show.

 season 1 special edition will include that plus many commentairies about the 6 episodes, a look at the new series and many more extras but most important it will include.......DELETED SCENES which are missing from the current season 1 edition dvd.
