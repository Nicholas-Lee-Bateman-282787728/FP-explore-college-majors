7896822,4,6305870144,"Sleeping Dogs,"" adapted from C.K. Steads novel Smiths Dream, Sleeping Dogs takes place in the near future and stars Sam Neill in his first lead role in a feature as Smith, a man escaping the break-up of his marriage by finding isolation on an island off the coast of New Zealand. As he settles into his new life, the country is experiencing its own turmoil: an oil embargo has led to martial law and civil war, with the government being led by a man with Fascist ambitions who uses the energy crisis, violent street demonstrations, and a mass shooting to give himself new dictatorial powers and establish a force of Special Police."" Smith reluctantly finds himself drawn into the escalating conflict.

Director Roger Donaldson draws a number of parallels to Hitlers Nazi Germany, similarities showing that fascism will draw upon discontent to foment civil strife. We see a peaceful country disintegrate with liberties curtailed, violence rampant, and a future looking bleak. Setting the film in the near future is a cautionary touch, suggesting that the plot may not be that far fetched. Donaldson incorporates a good deal of action to keep the films pace brisk, while observing the mounting chaos through the eyes of Smith. The name Smith is also the central character of George Orwells 1984, a choice that probably isn't coincidental. Both men are awakened to the destructive rules of the State when they are no longer mere observers, but victims.

Bonus materials on the unrated Blu-ray release include commentary by writer-director Roger Donaldson, actor Sam Neill and actor-writer Ian Mune; The Making of Sleeping Dogs (2004), a 65-minute retrospective documentary on the films production featuring interviews with Donaldson, Neill, and Mune; The Making of Sleeping Dogs (1977), a behind-the-scenes featurette; theatrical trailer; and reversible sleeve featuring original and newly commissioned artwork.",1524096000,,1908,5.2730263157894735
7896823,3,6305870144,"The first feature-length 35mm film produced entirely in New Zealand, Sleeping Dogs certainly doesn't look like an amateur production, what with future Jurassic Park star Sam Neill in the lead role of a wandering laborer falsely accused of staging a terrorist attack, and director Roger Donaldson (No Way Out, Species, Dante's Peak) looking quite comfortable behind the camera already.  The film is a calling card of sorts, but, to its credit, comes off as something more than just another cinematic resume submitted for Hollywood's approval.  Sleeping Dogs stays true to its New Zealand roots, even if that means dropping the rest of its audience into a political morass that's well nigh impossible to sort out.

Luckily, Sam Neill makes for such an appealing man-on-run (here done up more like a California surfer than his clean-cut contemporary look) that the more New Zealand-specific aspects of the script are just background noise.  Arrested for conspiring with the revolutionary movement, his character stages a daring escape only to find him falling in with the very revolutionaries he was accused of conspiring with in the first place!  Warren Oates pops up as a loud-mouthed American soldier, but that's Sleeping Dogs only real concession to international marketing.  For the most part, it gets by on the homegrown talent that proved it was too talented to stick around for long.  Arrow Video's Blu-ray presentation is one of their best (and that's saying something), including a commentary, vintage and more recent Making Of documentaries and collector's booklet.",1522540800,,1573,5.268

7896825,4,6305870144,"This film had some impact on thoughtful people in New Zealand between its release and the end of the conservative Muldoon administration in 1984. The prime minister in Sleeping Dogs behaves in ways strikingly similar to NZ Prime Minister Robert Muldoon's policies, 1975-1984. Faced with economic decline, Muldoon attacked immigrants, anti-apartheid protesters, homosexuals, trade unionists, indeed any interest he thought he could use to divert attention from his government's performance. Perhaps it's a testament to how stoic New Zealanders are that an insurgency of the sort depicted in this film did not develop in this small South Pacific nation. The film departs from C.K.Stead's novella, ""Smith's Dream"" upon which it is based, in three main respects. First, the ""man alone"" theme is sold much more gently in the novel than here. In the film, Smith's Kiwi independence is at times a violent impulse. Second, the link between the secret police commander and Smith is much clearer in Stead's book. In the film, we know they are familiar with each other but not why. It's therefore hard to understand how they relate to each other subsequently. Third, the insurgency is a communist one in the novella. In the film, this isn't clear and for the most part the cold war links are not made (except for Warren Oates' post-Vietnam US military advisers), making it harder to see the events in context. I assume the intent on the part of the screenwriters was to avoid anything that took our attention away from the ""man alone"" theme. One of the screenwriters and the actor who plays the character ""Bullen"" in the film - the multitalented Ian Mune - has appeared in many NZ films since the early 1970s, including ""The Piano."" He has an amusing - to me anyway - cameo in ""Lord of the Rings"" as a town watchman who challenges the wraiths outside the village with the pub.",1010620800,3,1865,4.886435331230284
7896826,3,6305870144,"The first film New Zealand film ever to be released in the U.S reflects the political and social issues of NW during the late 1970's early 80's.  Neil stars as a political outcast that leaves his wife and child behind after being alienated by the oppressive government and a workers strike gone wrong.  Interesting story line is confusing to follow and some odd direction bring down the points a little.  Although, it is important for U.S viewers to remember NOT to get caught up in the specific issues within the film that we do not understand, because after all, we do not live in New Zealand, and could not possibly come to fully comprehend the political issues of the time period.  I recomend that viewers pay attention more to the characters and the interesting course they take rather than the actual issues presented in the film, because they will prove to be hard to follow.",996019200,,882,4.670967741935484
