2313582,5,B0009RQRR4,"Television is generally not good for children.  Mr. Rogers is the exception.  While even Mr. Rogers would discourage parents from letting their children watch hours of the Neighborhood day after day, I'm firmly convinced that Mr. Rogers is one of the few programs that, if used by parents in moderation, will actually help your children's emotional growth.  This group of episodes is no exception. Despite my best efforts, my child could not grasp that playing games was fun--even if you lost. With his uncanny ability to speak to children, Mr. Rogers' episodes on competition helped my daughter to gain perspective on winning, losing, and the value of trying something new--even if you are not ""perfect"" at it.

Thanks for making these available. We will be purchasing more!",1293926400,3,775,5.078740157480315
2313583,5,B0009RQRR4,"My children (ages 4 and 1) love Mister Roger's Neighborhood. We own all the DVDs available because our local PBS station no longer airs the program. My daughter loves both episodes on this DVD.

The first episode: Mister Roger's goes to school: Mister Rogers introduces children to a school bus driver, who takes them on a tour of the school bus. Then Mister Rogers goes for a ride to pick up school children. In the nieghborhood of make-believe, it's the first day of school at someplace else for Anna, Prince, and Daniel. They sing thier names, and talk aobut guitars. Parents of the children gather at the castle and await thier arrival and talk aobut missing them. I found it touching that Mister Rogers would include a little bit of emothional help for the parents, too.

On the television program, other episodes in this weeks theme included a trip to a kindergarten classroom, and a first grade classroom. I wish these were availble on DVD. Please contact Family Communications and join me in requesting more episodes on DVD.

The Second Episode: Learning: Mister Roger's talks about learning all different ways (caught rather than taught), and expiremnets with flashlights and battery operated toys. In the nieghborhood of make-believe the children at school vote to decide which is a better way to learn: field trips or a fancy learning machine.

My daughter likes this one and always wants to play with a flashlight after viewing it.

Also included is ""How people make crayons."" Fun and interesting.",1244419200,5,1509,4.925196850393701

2313586,5,B0009RQRR4,Mr. Rodgers is just the greatest in my opinion so it doesn't surprise me that I loved this dvd. I have a toddler who I am trying to teach about school so I thought this would be a great dvd to help explain a little about what goes on there. My daughter really dug the school bus that comes with this (a small toy that comes with the dvd) and especially the part of the dvd where he gives the viewer a tour of a real school bus. It's one episode of many I would love to watch with my little one and I only wish they offered more compilations of his show.,1225584000,4,553,3.9026548672566372

2313589,5,B0009RQRR4,"Mr. Rogers brings the purity and sincerity to a new generation. As in the newer children's programs of today where there is content that is objectionable for little eyes to see and little ears to hear, Mr. Rogers is an anchor for today's innocent children. I bought this for my three year old grandson and he loves the programs. This video is no exception and proves to be one that sends the message that each child is indeed very special and is accepted just as he/she is.  It has all the elements of honesty and and is appealing with the sounds of the trolly, the puppets, and the gentle, loving voice and face of Mr. Rogers.  The school bus toy is a great added bonus and a joy for my grandson to play with.",1182816000,19,710,4.291044776119403

2313621,5,B0009RQRR4,"I purchased this for my two small grandchildren.  I miss the calm and nurturing approach to children's entertainment.  Mr. Rogers had that and more. The shows were perfect for small preschoolers. In addition to a ""lesson of the day"", there were interesting places to visit and learn about.  More personal interaction and less Broadway, please. Do we need to sing everything?

2313626,5,B0009RQRR4,"Wonderful show. Great entertainment even 1/2 a century later.  I grew up on Mr. Rogers and so did all my friends and I'm just so pleased that I can now share these episodes with my own children.  All the 'children's' television programming today is complete trash and apart from completely banning my child from all TV related things....I can at least search out episodes like this that he can watch from time to time that he can enjoy without my needing to fear their content.  They are educational and Mr. Rogers has such a calm and peaceful nature.  Even now as an adult when I find myself upset with my child, I can summon (so to speak) the spirit of Mr. Rogers and respond to my child with a zen-like answer instead of loosing my cool.  Each episode not only educates my child on a functional aspect of his surrounding world but also on an emotional/social concept.  These cover a range of social/emotional topics such as divorce and friendship.  They also display how crayons, stamps, etc are produced.  I can't wait to purchase the remainder of the series.",1468195200,3,1063,4.617021276595745

This show teaches children how to navigate the world of growing up. They are affirmed and valued, but gently challenged to take control of their own actions.

From my standpoint, that makes the membership worth the expense.

2313775,5,B0009RQRR4,"Thank you, Amazon Prime for making these episodes available. I grew up watching Mister Rogers, and I was thrilled that my own children would now have the chance to watch them as well!",1396828800,,183,4.575757575757576
2313776,5,B0009RQRR4,My daughter has disabilities and Mr. Rogers truly entertains and teaches. Thank you for adding it to Amazon Prime! We enjoy it!,1396396800,,127,4.818181818181818
2313777,5,B0009RQRR4,"I came across the Mister Roger's Neighborhood series while looking for something for my two daughters (3 and 5) to watch. I remembered how i liked the show when I was younger, thought they would enjoy it and they really like Daniel Tiger's Neighborhood, so I wanted to see if they would make the connection (Daniel Tiger's neighborhood is based on Mister Rodger's Neighborhood of Make Believe). They love the show! they request to watch it all the time and they made the connection very quick with the similarities  between it and Daniel Tiger.  This show is educational and entertaining.  By today's standards, it is probably overly simple and silly, but I think our society can use a little more of that. It teaches kids how to deal with everyday feelings and situations, it shows interesting clips on how certain items are made or used and the Neighborhood of Make Believe is awesome for getting the little one's imaginations going! I feel completely secure in letting my kids watch any episode they want whenever they want, even if I can not sit and monitor every minute of what they are watching. So glad Amazon is providing the ability to watch this show again!",1395878400,,1167,4.738916256157635
2313778,5,B0009RQRR4,"My five year old loves Mr Rogers, and his gentle words about feelings always help.  She loves to sing the intro song with him, and the goodbye song.

2313779,5,B0009RQRR4,"Each episode has a theme (or themes) that is approached from a variety of ways, including make-believe and Mr Roger's skits and explanation, etc. The themes address the wonder towards creation/the world that children have. They enable children to explore music, animals, foreign cultures, etc. Later seasons bring in themes to help children understand social problems that had become more prevalent (e.g. divorce) after the shows inception. It is fun, intelligent, and affirming or uplifting programming.",1394928000,,504,5.644736842105263
2313780,5,B0009RQRR4,"My 5 year old boy loves Mr. Rogers.  Mr. Rogers is timeless, his subject matter always is delivered in a gentle manner for a child.  Modern children's shows are too loud, too smart-mouthed (take Sid the Science Kid), with a constant barrage of noise and irritating mannerisms depicted by the characters.  Mr. Rogers is a gentleman, and a gentle man, who still is relevant today.",1393891200,,378,4.7846153846153845

2313796,3,B0009RQRR4,"Mr. Rogers is still great even many years later! The 3 stars instead of 5 is only due to the poor quality of the video transfer and the shameful way that the seller ( and perhaps Amazon.com) has packaged this series. Instead of just providing them in simple chronological order, the shows are presented in a confusing and poorly laid out manner. Many episodes are missing from week long story lines; ""Josephine the short necked giraffe"" for example is missing an entire show from the opera. More objectionable is the way that ""The Fred Rogers Company"" ( I don't think they should even be using his name ) never releases an entire week to any PBS station, usually making the purchase of the final episode, which contains the ultimate lesson of the whole week necessary. Hooray for Mr. Rogers....shame on ""The Company""!",1384819200,7,817,4.76056338028169

2313800,5,B0009RQRR4,Mr. Roger's patience and kindness are apparent in every episode.

In this set we've watched the Competition week and Pets week. I would plan on watching complete weeks to resolve the Neighborhood of Make Believe stories--the first couple of days introduce problems that are all resolved by the end of the week, and I know my children want to know how the stories end--and I want to make sure they get the right idea instead of picking up the negative behavior that has to be corrected (Lady Elaine, I'm talking about you!)",1377302400,,673,4.616666666666666

I love watching my 2 year old son soaking in the calm and educational information. Heck, I love watching it!

My children don't get to wake up ready to say we're going to make a snappy today with Mr. Rogers on our local PBS affiliate, but through the offering of episodes here on Amazon, my sons and I get to share the Neighborhood of Make Believe and trips to the crayon factory that I shared with my mother as a tyke.

Mister Rogers actually gets visibly frustrated while trying to make a rainbow appear and thus the show is a fantastic springboard for talking about when things don't go according to plan. In ""make believe"" a character encounters his own frustration when he is unable, at first, to make a rainbow appear in the sky. In the end everyone is able to make a rainbow and to top it off there is a great factory video of a gold mine.",1311811200,,536,4.37
2313839,2,B0009RQRR4,"I'm twenty-eight years old. Mister Rogers and I have been television neighbors since the day I was born on February 8, 1983. I love his messages. They're timeless and perfect for any age. No matter how old you are everyone needs to feel loved and accepted by someone. When I found out that Amazon finally had Mister Rogers on DVD I was thrilled! This was what I had been waiting for! At least I thought so.
I went online and picked out the ones I wanted for Christmas. I got the one called Competition Big Bird Visits the Neighborhood. Disabilties A visitor who visits Leg Braces, and Curiosity the beginning of learning.
When they arrived, I couldn't wait to watch them. Again, I love Mister Rogers, but I was disappointed to find out that I paid ten bucks for one single episode.  What a rip off! There weren't even any special features. No special tours, no sing alongs, no interviews, etc. I was expecting to see the whole theme of competition carried out throughout the week just like Mister Rogers did. These are classic shows that I'd like to keep not just for myself as an adult, but also to show my children and grandchildren someday. I'd like to show them the classics I grew up with the way I grew up with them so that they can have an appreciation for who Mister Roogers really was. That man is one of the reasons I write the way I write as a children's writer. I'm trying to carry out the principles he taught that were so helpful to me.
Episodes of Mister Rogers aren't just shows, they're keepsakes because the show is so unique. The way It's packaged right now, it doesn't allow kids to get to know the real Mister Rogers and understand why he was loved by so many. What a shame! To paraphase what another person who reviewed another Mister Rogers DVD said, I don't think Mister Rogers would approve of the way we're marketing his products- especially with what he taught about the environment and receyling. This is wasteful. I agree! It's a disgrace! We're totally contriadicting his message! If we're going to honor Mister Rogers, we need to do it right. Again, I really love Mister Rogers. The epiosodes I purchased are great. I just don't feel like I got my money's worth. Until I hear of improvements being made on these products, I will not be buying anymore Mister Rogers products from Amazon.com.",1301184000,,2321,4.5393794749403344
2313840,2,B0009RQRR4,"Please note that the other reviewers of this item entered reviews for a different epoisode of Mr. Rogers, and not episode #1481, which called is called ""Competition"". There is nothing about going to school on this DVD, and it does not come with a toy.

My three-year old son and I are both enormous fans of Mr. Rogers and own the first week of Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood on DVD, as well as the Friendship/Love DVD and Circus Time DVD. All those DVDs are wonderful in that the single episodes hold together and don't leave a lot of unanswered questions (to be answered in a follow on episode).

I was hesitant to buy this DVD not only because it was a single 1/2 hour episode for ten dollars, but more because I was concerned it would not hold together conceptually because Mr. Rogers shows ran for half an hour a day for a full week to bring an idea or event to full fruition at the conclusion of a five-episode week. My fears were justified. About six (very interesting minutes) of this DVD is an overview of a crayon factory. The rest of the DVD is equal parts Mr. Rogers drawing with crayons at an easel, and time spent in the Neighborhood of Make Believe preparing for King Friday's art competition. Lady Elaine is certain she will win The Competition because she wants to. She goes so far as to say angrily ""I HATE to lose, I hate it!"" and ""people like you when you win!"" Miss Cow is uncertain how an art contest can even be judged, since art is subjective. Clearly the episode was setting the stage for teaching children about competition, losing, winning, and what art really is. And then just like that, the 30 minutes is over and none of those issues are explained or resolved. My three-year old walked away from that episode hearing that ""people like you better when you win"", and also having learned the word ""hate"". No follow-through, no positive life lesson, no teaching moments. Though I love Mr. Rogers, I will never buy a single episode again and certainly don't recommend anyone else do either. Incidently, the quality of the DVD is a little off in the images are a little jerky and jumpy (it's subtle, but it's there).

Perhaps I am nave, but I really cannot imagine that Fred Rogers would approve of his shows being sold as single DVDs at such a high price. The episodes just don't hold together on their own because they were designed to move slowly and to unfold AS A GROUP over a full week to culminate in lessons that are lasting and meaningful, which takes time. Further, selling single episodes is a terrible waste of resources (plastic packaging, cardboard for shipping, etc), which I don't believe Mr. Rogers would have been supporive of. The only reason these these episodes are sold singly is greed, and the result is damaging to the quality of Mr. Rogers' messages and legacy, and to the environment as well.",1299628800,74,2836,4.556862745098039
