3803200,2,B001UNVDWA,"There wasn't much advertised on this and when I read about it on UHM, [...] I though Hmm, this looks pretty good. Good cast of actors, good description, this is worth a watch.
Boy was I wrong. I barely got through this movie. Whats worse is the religious aspect that they throw at you toward the end. I wouldnt recommend this to anyone.
This could have been a great movie, but alas another movie bites the dust, but if you must see it/own it Im sure it will be in the doller bin soon.",1244592000,,484,4.159574468085107
3803201,1,B001UNVDWA,"Poor screenplay, bad dialogue, very shallow character development; not even decent special effects. If you liked the movie Doom (which I doubt), you MIGHT find this not a total waste of time (which I doubt even more). Even watching this at 2 X speed was grueling. I found myself feeling sorry for the actors, wondering what they thought when they saw the final cut. Surely, Cuba Gooding, Jr et al deserved more than this!",1244073600,,421,4.702702702702703
3803202,1,B001UNVDWA,"...Wow...All these actors must be hard-up for cash because this movie by far is the biggest disgrace to everything hollywood. Acting was atrocious, storyline(plot)could have been good if it was handled by talent but it wasn't, and all in all an amazing disappointment! Don't let the list of actors in this movie trick you...it's total garbage and all these actors (Cuba Gooding Jr, Ray Winstone, Ron Perlman and Henry Rollins) should be ashamed. Sean Connery's son Jason Connery shows us that talent is not inherited and hopfully he never directs again.",1243468800,,553,5.087912087912088
3803203,4,B001UNVDWA,"I was expecting much less from this movie. The beginning of the movie had me wondering how bad the movie was going to turn out to be, but it actually got better through out. Once the action started and the plot started coming together I was entertained for the rest of the movie. I just watched Terminator Salvation in the theaters which cost $200 million to make, and I actually found The Devil's Tomb more entertaining and I didn't feel like I wasted my money after watching it (unlike with Terminator). Give it a shot, you might like it.",1243382400,,540,4.4646464646464645
3803204,1,B001UNVDWA,"I thought there might be a chance this movie would be amusing, if not slightly reasonable given the cast.

I was wrong.

There might be some spoilers here, and for this movie I use the word lightly, but be warned.

The basic plot:

1) Crack team of commando type soldiers get assigned a special mission. Cuba us their leader.
2) An anthropologist, who works for the CIA, is the special 1-time leader. Their mission is to extract her father, who is another scientist type.
3) The go into a bunker, which used to be a tomb (1,000 feet deep). In the process, we learn that ""sand can blast your skin off, so stay tight"". Because if you are close to one another, obviously sand *can't* blast your skin off... for some reason.
4) The SAS type folks then find a person full of disease like boils. Of course, they treat the person and don't think that this is odd. The person is a priest, still alive, who they don't bother really containing.
5) Most of the SAS types go down a very fast moving elevator. 1 stays up. We learn that you can watch porn anywhere, as the 1 at the top level is keen to view porn. Later (by the way) he see's a hot lady on the level (which they previously cleared). So, we learn that SAS folks expect to find hot, naked ladies on levels of underground bunkers - which were previously found to have no hot naked ladies - and this is normal. Of course she eats him.
6) Back to our fearless heroes below. We learn that if you are SAS, and you see your unborn baby girl suddenly be a little girl while wondering the tombs underground corridors, you should follow her. It's a great idea. Then we learn that if she turns into a demon, that's reasonable (and she's still...cute?) I suppose SAS deal with that daily. Then, if you hear her again, you should follow her again. Even after she tried to bite you last time. Then, as you *are* in a danger zone and on a mission, whilst hearing your demon baby calling down the halls, our fearless mother to be decides it's a good time to suck on another woman's disease boils while satisfying her lesbian curiosity. Okay.
7) The rest of the troop go wandering around, looking for the lead scientist. Whilst doing the wandering, we learn a few more things:
a) That any other hallucination is something good, and should be followed, listened to, or otherwise obeyed.
b) That demon's don't know how to use elevators. But they can discourse on philosophy, open doors, use radios, equipment, and basically anything else. Except elevators.
8) The above relates to some plot line where the demons (I think) want to get out of the tomb. But they can't. Even though it turns out there are *two* entrances/exits, and for 1 of them you *didn't* need to use the elevator. It's a mystery why they can't get out. Maybe I missed something about them being impaired with elevator button pushing.
9) So they have the showdown with the major demon thing. Then, Cuba's character, who doesn't seem at all religious, get's inspired by another character. When he touches her amulet, he instantly becomes infused with passion and deep spiritual belief he's never had before, and suddenly becomes obsessed with a new calling in life. Cuba is now the religious demon hunter.

One could go on and on with the silly plot holes. If any of this sounds ridiculous to you, that's because it is. Really.

Watch this movie if you get it free, don't value your time (or are really sick, and laying on the couch in a fever), or really want to laugh at how bad a movie can be.",1243296000,33,3495,4.453125
3803205,3,B001UNVDWA,"Short Attention Span Summary:

1. We are introduced to some people who are going into the desert to find some scientist who needs rescuing.

2. All of the characters are military personnel who have served in active combat, and we keep getting flashbacks that tell us some very vague things about these periods of their lives.

3. We also find out that there is something in this area that they are exploring that is supernatural/ evil.

4. At the end, it turns out that the purpose of the military expedition was to bring one woman to oversee the death of her father and take his place doing something between holding back demons and holding the gates of hell closed.

Looking back, this movie was really weird. The first thing is that the ending was really disappointing. They went through all this for a single change of positions (=daughter changing with father)? It seems like the suspense was well built up, but the ending was ultimately anti-climactic. Secondly: The religious symbols used here were too.....esoteric/ unfamiliar. Ok, I know that the writers didn't want to do done to death vampires/ angels/ vengeful ghosts. Fair enough. But could they have at least done something vaguely familiar? Or could they have introduced the material in such a way that we could have followed what was going on?

What else? If you were some solider somewhere and you saw all these VERY STRANGE things happening, what would you do? Would you continue to go deeper into that Leviathan or would you just say: ""It's been fun folks. Goodbye."" A sense of duty where you might be killed on the battlefield is one thing. A sense of stupidity when you might have to face the supernatural is quite another.

This is not worth a movie ticket. It's worth, at most, a rental off the New Releases shelf.",1242259200,5,1787,4.708333333333333

3803221,1,B001UNVDWA,"What a disappointment! Cuba Gooding Jr. and Ron Perlman were obviously at the mercy of an inept director and a high school script writer. Ron Perlman's involvement was much too short; his talent's were of course doomed to the same fate as Gooding's. There was no logical flow from one scene to another with abrupt changes in camera angles which seemed totllay unrelated to what was happening at the time telling me their budget couldn't afford a 'story board'. Gooding's character seemed lost and at no time was he under control of his 'team'. I found it rather comical watching the members of his group searching in 'single file' mind you,  with their M16's pointed at the back of each other's heads and at no time checking their respective blind corners. The set was some where in some one's dirty, uninteresting basement instead of the high tech facility I was expecting to see and the alien or evil angelical special effects were state of the art for the 1950's. I could go on.
Cuba Gooding is a wonderful actor especially with his roles in 'What Dreams May Come' with Robin williams and 'Line Watch' to name two. Were it not for his face on the DVD case I would have felt totally ripped off. But actors need to eat and care for their families as we all do so I was glad to help him with his mortgage payments.",1355875200,,1314,4.497907949790795

The plot was idiotic, the acting was so-so, and the scenes were... grotesque.  Honestly, I felt like throwing up after watching some of it.

3803224,1,B001UNVDWA,"This is the kind of film that good actors would place on their 'films I'd like to forget I was in during my early career' vita. The sad part is that Cuba Gooding, Jr made this film after he won an Academy Award and acted in some very good films. But since 2001, his vita contains nothing but one lousy B movie after another and 'The Devil's Tomb' is no exception. Cuba Gooding sleepwalks though this terrible film that isn't even up to SYFY Channel standards. Here is hoping that his role in George Lucas' 'Red Tails' brings him back to A-list standards.",1327104000,,554,4.388349514563107
3803225,2,B001UNVDWA,"Once you get past the opening static and realize that's the most coherent part of this movie you know you're in for a rough ride.  Fortunately, at only 90 minutes, it was relatively painless to sit through.  I watched askance, thinking: why did Ron Perlman let them put him through this (I hope he was well paid), and, isn't it about time Cuba Gooding Jr. stopped trading on his Oscar (at this point in his career I've long since believed it to be a typo, the award actually went to William H. Macy for Fargo).  The plot, I'm assuming that's what it was, concerned getting a team of jokers to accompany an agent (Valerie Cruz) into a very deep complex because she was afraid of the dark, and/or didn't want to die alone.  They lost me after the obligatory macho posturing: ""Lock & Load ladies.""  (I've always wondered what women in the military use on each other as a derogatory putdown, ""alright, gentlemen, let's lock and load!"")  I'm sorry; I got a little giddy after the 10 minute mark, especially when I realized there were 80 minutes to go!  I'll save you the time, here's the movie in a sentence: there was an inordinate amount of Cuba flashbacks, creepy people roaming the halls, hallucinations galore, a complex that went on forever and included interior windows plus cold storage, everyone was apparently ""born ready"", they didn't leave home without a computer geek, everyone had issues, housekeeping was off that week because there was blood everywhere, a naked woman/ugly bald guy, lots of babbling and spitting, guys who found out the hard way what ""don't fence me in"" means, just because you're a priest doesn't mean you're not going to be threatened, earthquakes (why not, they've done just about everything else), and.....Nephilim.  I realized too late that wasn't one of Santa's elves.

I lived through it, that's a plus, would I ever watch it again, no, because I'm getting rid of it!  Was it one of the worst films ever made?  No, but it tried!",1312243200,,1963,4.6938775510204085
3803226,4,B001UNVDWA,"""The Devil's Tomb"" is a 2009 release DVD movie with mercenaries, helicopters, war flash-backs, lots of blood, guts, brains, bones, and torn flesh hanging out and on the floors and walls, people and zombies shot with high caliber weapons at close range, electrocutions, stabbings, demons, extra-terrestrial aliens, demonic possession, extreme body mutilation, death and coming back to life when they shouldn't be able to, religious themes, computer hackers, military operations, lots of cussing, naked women, and stars Cuba Gooding Jr., Taryn Manning, Valerie Cruz, Zack Ward, Stephanie Jacobson, Ron Perlman, Sarah Ann Morris, Henry Rollins, Melanie Chapman, and others I didn't recognize.  Although the film predominantly takes place underground, it was filmed in Los Angeles, California.  Some call this lightweight, others say it is B-class horror, and a few pity Cuba Gooding Jr. for having been in this film.  I'm going to say I didn't feel like this was a total waste of my time, and although there were no pitchforks, meat bearing grappling hooks, chainsaws, hatchets, or impalements on spears or pipes at the bottom of an elevator shaft, and there didn't seem to be as many insects as there should have been; the movie merits a second viewing for me and I'm glad I bought it.  The female nudity could have been more engaging, but at least it existed - which it should in ALL `R' rated films.  Violence and language have never been enough to merit an `R' rating alone, especially in contemporary America.  Censorship needs to figure out how desensitized people are to violence and language and start upping the ante in the rating judgments.  So for me to rank this film, based upon whether or not it delivered what I bought it and viewed it for, I'm going to say 4 stars.  It needed more nightmare fodder, and more gratuitous female eye candy exploitation, but for anybody under 14 years of age, this film might be good enough as it is.",1311638400,4,1943,4.938650306748467
3803227,1,B001UNVDWA,"So you want to make a film about zombies, but the whole zombie thing is overblown.  What do you do? Make the zombies possessed humans instead!  Director Jason Connery takes the ickiest aspects of the Exorcist and projects them onto the zombie trope in Devil's Tomb, complete with boils, blotched skin, white irises, and black vomit. These zombies are actually possessed priests sent to contain a Nephilim, which in a twist worthy of Chuck Missler, is portrayed as a Grey alien. That's about the only innovative twist Devil's Tomb has to offer.

And really, why should we be surprised?  The warning signs are right there in the title: Devil's. Tomb. This is a devil's tomb, get it? He's entombed and he's a devil! This Nephilim is trying to get out of course, and he possesses a variety of Special Forces soldiers to execute his ingenious plan of...not using the elevator that the soldiers take down to reach him.

Oh yeah, the plot. Mack (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) leads a Special Forces team on a mission to rescue a scientist named Wesley (Ron Perlman) at the behest of CIA agent Elissa Cardell (Valerie Cruz). Wesley, who also happens to be Elissa's father, was on an archaeological dig site that has since been sealed for mysterious reasons. Elissa won't explain why, but we know it has something to do with Wesley.  The movie wisely saves Perlman for last, because really, even Gooding is sleepwalking through this movie.

The movie shambles from there.  Half the film is taken up by flashbacks to the various soldier's sins: soldiers who had abortions, soldiers who lust after porn stars, and soldiers who activate self-destruct devices that require a hasty exit with great self-sacrifice. This is one of those movies where every character is defined by his sins, because those will be important later, and so the script doesn't bother to work for the audience's sympathy. There's nothing quite like a Special Forces team that can't stop looking at porn in the middle of a highly classified op.

Bill Moseley tries to lend some gravitas to the zombies as the Bible-quoting Duncan, but really he just comes off as Moseley in zombie makeup cashing in his paycheck.  More disappointing is Gooding, who toughens up his funny guy image with a potty mouth. The rest of the actors I can excuse for this nonsense but I expected better from him.

You have to work hard to make a zombie film boring to zombie fans, but Devil's Tomb does it by never admitting its shameful secret...that it's a zombie film dressed up in Exorcist's clothing.",1308096000,,2528,4.788505747126437
3803228,4,B001UNVDWA,"I really enjoyed this movie unlike many of the other reviewers and while i agree on some of the reviewers claims about the defunct soldier spec-ops and the way they act at times in the film, you must remember that they were mercs/soldiers for hire...at times even irl that kind of soldier leaves a lot to be desired.  Being a person that used to train with army special forces, the team in the movie don't seem like the real deal...that's because they are mercs, and they are not.

  I especially like the plot about the government finding nephalim (angelic/human hybrids) buried in Iraq (earliest civilizations of mankind)which is not something that is just made up out of the blue by a fictional writer but has its basis in the book of genesis of the holy bible...the flood was even Gods way of destroying all of the nephalim and starting over.  A very unique plot line.  Just how many movies have been made depicting the nephalim...a hand few?  The movie should get two stars just from that fact alone, as well as getting the countries they would have been found in correct...it would have been a little silly to have the plot line Tennessee hillbilly's find Nephalim in the Mountains and squeal like a pig.

  I would have liked the secret organization fleshed out a little more that Perlman's character, ""Wesley"" worked for and their mandates and what Gooding's character was going to do at the end of the movie.  I suppose they were going to leave that for a sequel...a shame to as it will probably never be made.  Like I said I really enjoyed the movie.",1295395200,,1560,4.592057761732852
3803229,1,B001UNVDWA,"So here's where actors and actresses who work as waiters and waitresses go. Most ""big name"" directors would tell these people ""keep your day job"".

For Special OPs people they ride in an old Huey (low budget could not afford a Black Hawk). They use regular M4's with only flashlite attachments. No lasers or special sights (cheap budget).

 Cuba Gooding is pretty pathetic in this one. He shoots a ""zombie"" in the head, and one of his soldiers in another room asks ""what was that?"" Soldiers who are used to gunfire asking what a shot was? Franky G trying his worst to be a Jesse Ventura clone (a la Predator) comes off laughable. There's one scene where one female soldier starts shooting at a ""vision"" of her daughter, then two of her buddies join in shooting at nothing; emptying their mags in the process. - ""What were we shooting at?"" exclaims one of the idiot soldiers.

3803231,3,B001UNVDWA,"The Devil's Touch had its moments.  It definitely falls under the ""cliched horror thriller"" category.  There's nothing remotely original or especially exciting about the Devil's Tomb, and movies like the Resident Evil series have done more or less the same thing much much better (of course, the Resident Evil movies are nothing compared to the games, but that's a story for another time).

A group of soldiers find their way into an underground facility in the middle of a desert, and while there, there's an evil presence lurking around.  Each of the soldiers are your typical generic affair, and none of them particularly stand out in any way.  You have a couple hot soldier chicks, a nerdy guy who gets frightened easily, a couple ""bad to the bone"" tough guys, etc.  Nothing original about them.

The actual horror and suspense is pretty good at times, but you have to sit through several sections of slow storyline build-up that basically switches around from typical Hollywood generic fluff to just ultimately confusing to understand the events taking place (and borders on sci-fi at times as well).

The first 20 minutes are very very boring, and when the movie tries to wrap up the plot by the very end, the boredom makes another appearance.  However, in between you're treated to some rather cool looking blood-soaked bad guys, and lots of machine gun shooting action.

It's not terrible, but it's forgettable because plenty of films have attemped to do the same thing that this movie does with the generic action/horror violence, but most of them succeed a little better than this one.  Oh, and the scene involving a little girl is quite scary indeed!  GREAT moment of suspense.",1287446400,,1688,4.904929577464789

The elite soldiers are led by Mack (Cuba Gooding Jr.), a capable soldier with a past. Of course, they are in for a nasty surprise. This is not a big secret. Check the film's title - ""The Devil's Tomb."" What else do you need to know?

Actually, the ""Resident Evil""-like story begins promisingly. About 15 minutes in, however, the story just stops moving forward and bogs down in the clumsy narrative that is repetitious and disconnected, often interrupted by uninteresting flashbacks. The premise itself is not bad, I admit, though it has been done before countless times, and with more flare.

In short, we need mystery, suspense, action, scare or something, anything. In ""The Devil's Tomb,"" you have none. No scares, no tension, nothing. None of the actors look like specially trained soldiers. None of them seem really interested in what their characters are doing.

Ray Winstone, Ron Pearlman and Bill Moseley appear as support, and the veteran actors' performances are decent. Sadly, their roles are not big. As to Cuba Gooding Jr. he is not bad. ""The Devil's Tomb"" marks the directorial debut of the actor Jason Connery, but he is not ready for the job. Perhaps someone like Paul W.S.

When they get inside they find that things have gone worse than they thought, that taking nothing out means that they can only get the one survivor and nothing more, and that things are not simply ""government issued experiments"" going on.

As far as the movie goes, I thought it would be a lot better. The names it boasted are good enough to keep a person interested and to say that they have star quality, but the script really feel short when it came to just about every aspect. From the corny names that the people have to the thing that is in the movie, everything drags and the movie preaches, spending more time asking what humans think of themselves in a cosmic aspect than actually kicking anything cool into gear. This means a lot of lagging, some of the same stuff, and a disappointing monster.

Honestly, I was saddened here.

Even if you like cheap movies or don't mind badly done things because of specific actors, I would say ""caution, Will Robinson!"" to watching this film. It disappoints and then some, and this is coming from a very tolerant person when it comes to cheaply-made monster flicks.",1265587200,,1504,4.501831501831502
3803253,5,B001UNVDWA,"This film was done during the writers strike. The actors in this film did it mostly to keep camera crews, lighting crews, and every other job that no one thinks about, working.

3803254,3,B001UNVDWA,"Well it appears as though I liked 'The Devil's Tomb' a little more than most of the other reviewers. I guess I'm just an old sentimentalist, I mean who doesn't enjoy a storyline involving Nephilim, demonic possession and the doorway to Hell? I sure do.

On second thought that's about all it had to offer. The characterizations and dialogue was predictable and one-dimensional and the storyline somewhat uneven. The film also lacked the necessary energy and momentum required to carry the plot through to its eventual conclusion. There was an occasional moment here and there where it did succeed in creating an eerie, demonic atmosphere that was slightly reminiscent of 'Hellraiser' but that feeling didn't last long enough to keep the viewing audience interested.

I'm probably being a little generous giving it a -3 Star- rating but I can't help myself, I'm a sucker for the subject matter.",1257033600,,893,5.027027027027027
3803255,1,B001UNVDWA,"Truly a low point in the art of film making.  I'm not a fan of Cuba Gooding but I'm saddened to see him in this piece of garbage.  I'd like to think that he at least made a decent wage from this but given the overall cheapness of the film I don't see how they could have afforded to.

When discussing what makes it so bad I'd have to say the plot cliches are worse than the script or character cliches.  The incredibly stupid actions of the military team members are an insult to the intelligence of all humans.

I give the film one star for Cuba who did a respectable job of keeping a straight face while delivering such obviously flawed lines.  There is nothing he could have possibly done to pull this film out of the hell-hole or bottomless pit that it resides in.  I made the mistake of not knowing this was a straight to DVD release.  I saw it on the shelf and said it couldn't be too bad with both Cuba and the guy from Aliens 4 and City of Lost Children.  I feel for them both.",1252195200,,985,4.088541666666667

3803257,1,B001UNVDWA,"I knew within the first 90 seconds (near record) that this made for TV film was going to be a ff (fast forward) genre movie. The give-away - you ask? A script that is 90% pointless fake military jargon e.g. ""clear"" and lots and lots of swearing. It's obvious that the script writers, actors and director have a psychological issue with how they've spent their lives in Hollywood boutiques and are overcompensating by creating toughness the easiest way they know how - let's talk tough. Besides the totally, totally unbelievable tough guy/woman acting was the single day rental fee for a helicopter and some industrial warehouse basement to provide the obligatory concrete passages and steam piping. The story was nothing more creative than the time worn plot of the military hiding an alien or devil or whatever. Finally, the prosthetic makeup infected skin and gunshots were so juvenile dumb - yawn.",1251676800,,900,4.966887417218543
3803258,2,B001UNVDWA,"The Devil's Tomb: 4 out of 10: Not since ""Killer Flood: The Day the Dam Broke"" has a movie's title rendered about eighty percent of the plot development mute. Dumbass spoiler alert... Hey, the mysterious underground archeological site turns out to be a tomb. Whose tomb you ask? (IN MY BEST CHURCH LADY VOICE) ""Could it be Satan???"".

Okay so The Devil's Tomb is a remake of Prince of Darkness, but instead of Donald Pleasence we have the Space Marines from Aliens after a tragic mass lobotomization. Now I do realize that not every single American soldier is a fully-fledged genius; but honestly how any of these thunderheads managed to make it through basic training without throwing the pin is anyone's guess. (When you pull a pin on a grenade, you theoretically have a choice to throw one of two things. Most people choose the grenade part.) The characterization of the soldiers is simply not believable. This starts the film on a shakey foundation from which it never fully recovers. Not that things improves all that much when the mumbo-jumbo starts.

This is a shame because the acting is overall up to the task. Now when you have Cuba Gooding Jr., Ray Winstone, Ron Perlman and even Taryn Manning (who really surprised me with a fun performance.); you are going to have the potential for some decent acting. Throw in a fun Henry Rollins as a priest of all things and an over the top performance by Bill Moseley and you have one of the best-acted B movies this year. In a large cast only only Franky G drops the ball, in a horribly written role, as the dumb muscle.

The direction is by Jason Connery, who is best known* as Bennington in the TV Series ""Mary-Kate and Ashley in Action!"". The direction is serviceable, though he really needed a military advisor on set; or, at the very least, someone who has played paintball. The poor soldiers did not seem to know what to do with their rifles and kept pointing them at each other. In addition, if you are firing a kill shot you may want to line it up AWAY from the hostage.

Special effects and set design are competent. Heck there is even a lesbian subplot that threatens to make the movie interesting (Though the script drops the ball on that as well.) If you can get through the first twenty minutes without your eyes rolling out of your head, The Devil's Tomb becomes a collection of interesting performances looking for a purpose. And figuring out who is buried in the Devil's Tomb will not keep most people entertained. (And no it isn't Ulysses S Grant).

*He is also the son of Scottish actor Sean Connery who played the old Spaniard in the Highlander movies during the Eighties.",1248912000,2,2643,4.602972399150743
3803259,2,B001UNVDWA,"What happened to Cuba Gooding Jr?  He went from Oscar winner to starring in direct to DVD B-flicks like this, The Devil's Tomb.  Cuba plays Mack, the leader of a special forces team who is assigned to a mysterious underground facility to rescue a scientist (Ron Perlman).  As everyone soon begins to learn however, there's something housed down there that should never have been found to begin with.  The Devil's Tomb doesn't offer anything that we haven't seen plenty of times before, and while there are some decent gore effects and gross out moments, the film's biggest flaw is its cliche script, and the fact that these supposed special forces operatives do some pretty dumb things.  Cuba is as good as he can be, while Taryn Manning turns in a particularly terrible performance as the team's doctor turned demon.  Jason London, Zack Ward, and Henry Rollins are on board as well, as are genre stalwarts Perlman and Bill Moseley, and Ray Winstone in a cameo; all three of whom are undoubtedly the best part of the film.  All in all, The Devil's Tomb offers little other than the actors that are in it, and other than that, there isn't much reason to catch it otherwise.",1247788800,,1172,4.68780487804878
3803260,1,B001UNVDWA,"I saw the trailer of this movie and it looked well done (I guess editing can do wonders). But when I saw the movie, I can't believe Cuba Gooding signed up for this. I believe in casting the right actor to play the right character. Here, the casting is pretty bad. In every good military or war film, most actors undergo boot camp.  Here, it's just obvious that not one of them had any training, e.g. movement and handling of weapons.  The only credible acting here is done by Gooding. But even Mr. ""show me the money"" can't carry an entire production gone bad. The rest are miscast.  Any film which stars Ron Perelman as a scientist is bound to fail. I don't think even the deleted scenes from ""Alien"" would be as bad as this movie. The characters are supposed to be members of an elite military covert unit. But they talk and appear to be unprofessional. Taryn Manning is supposed to be a doctor or a medic.  But she carries a weapon.  Stephanie Jacobsen is not believable as a soldier. She can't act the part. It's just out of her range. I don't think she can even play a Vietnamese villager in a Vietnam war film. Brandon Fobbs's character is supposed to speak several languages but his accent is thuggish. Jason London's character ""Hicks"" appears to be taken directly from Michael Biehn's character in ""Aliens"", ""Cpl. Dwayne Hicks"". The helmets used for the flashback scenes are too small making the soldiers look funny.  The blood and make-up are too red. Jason Connery should take some tips from Ridley Scott's ""Black Hawk Down"" in shooting battle scenes. And what are priests doing under the Middle Eastern desert? The demons look like leftover characters from ""Buffy"" or ""Angel"". This DVD is a waste of time and money. The editing and lighting are bad as well. The worse part is the direction. I am guessing Jason Connery never went to film school.  But then again, Quentin Tarantino didn't go either. I could have made a better movie than this. And I am not even a director.",1245369600,2,1983,4.569014084507042
