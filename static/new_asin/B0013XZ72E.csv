8253319,1,B0013XZ72E,"Waste of Money. Maciste vs Hercules had a stupid storyline about a wrestling promoter going back in time in a time machine to locate potential wrestlers. I should have saw this coming. The video quality was horrible. Really, don't wate your money.",1479254400,,247,4.904761904761905
8253320,5,B0013XZ72E,The dvd worked fine but I found the picture to be very bad and the color was horrible.  Other than that I loved the dvd.,1464393600,,120,3.8

8253324,4,B0013XZ72E,Machiste in the Valley of Woe is funny and Kirk Morris is a very good comic actor which I was suprised to see. He looks amazing and kids his own image in a very funny way. Ignore the poor color and enjoy the comedy.,1271203200,2,215,3.909090909090909
8253325,4,B0013XZ72E,"First off, the picture quality of this DVD is poor. The colours have deteriorated to the point where the picture is more like shades of yellow and orange rather than colour. Also, the movie is dubbed into English as I believe it was shot in Italian. The audio is clear enough, but certainly not Dolby Digital or anything.

However, quality issues aside, the story isn't bad and if you get into the spirit of it you'll enjoy it. Personally, I bought it because of the fact that this is one of the late, great Reg Park's movies (he made five sword and scandal films in all) and he went on to win the Mr. Universe bodybuilding title for the third time the year after this film was made. For bodybuilding fans, seeing one of the all-time greats near his peak is well worth the low price of this DVD alone. Park comes from an era before steroids entered into bodybuilding and was outspoken and adamantly opposed to them throughout his life (saying to the effect that he handily won the Mr. Universe title before steroids were available, and didn't feel a need for them afterwards). This film gives the viewer an idea of what calibre physique a very gifted individual can achieve without drugs but with hard work and dedication. For that reason this film, regardless of any theatrical shortcomings, is historically significant.

To be sure, this isn't Oscar winning material by today's standards, but it is a solid story. Reg Park looks fantastic and for fans of the era/genre, Reg Park or bodybuilding, it's a worthy addition to your collection.

I haven't watched the second feature yet (Maciste Against Hercules in the Vale of Woe), starring Kirk Morris and Frank Gordon, so I have no review of that other than to say the picture quality is bad as well.",1250812800,11,1750,4.638709677419355
8253326,1,B0013XZ72E,"again this item belongs to one of those ""most of the sword-and-sandal movies that are available on DVD are panned-and-scanned, and typically are of poor image quality"". not recommanded.",1229212800,12,185,5.413793103448276
