This video handles the topic of leadership and team building using contemporary terminology.  It provides strategies.  The video compliments most current text books (in terms of approach).

The high school actors do take away from the credibility of the instruction unfortunately.",1249948800,,425,5.205882352941177

I did not even ask my money back - it's drivel of the lowest order.",1194048000,3,117,3.5384615384615383
