5880057,5,B00DZ7DRI2,This instructive video is a must see for anyone wanting to work out as it demonstrates proper form and how to avoid injury at the same time. The instructors are excellent and very knowledgeable. I highly recommend it.,1379462400,4,217,4.7368421052631575
5880058,5,B00DZ7DRI2,"It is so refreshing to see an exercise video with such great substance, credibility and is so user friendly.  The exercices in this video are easily done at home or in a gym and Bill's narrative on how to perform the exercises is clear and easy to understand. I am buying this dvd to share with family and friends!!",1379289600,9,315,4.338983050847458
5880059,5,B00DZ7DRI2,"The market is flooded with exercise DVDs created by so-called fitness experts....even the celebrity trainers on TV don't have the medical knowledge base to be creating routines. Finally, a program created by an educated, trained clinical specialist!

Bill has an impeccable reputation with Olympic and professional athletes and has now has created an exercise program for the 'rest of us'. I'm using it to train for ski season, but it'll get you in shape for any sport...or just to improve your overall health and conditioning. I like that each exercise includes an explanation on technique with demonstrations. I've put this on my iphone so I can take the program to the gym.

Big thumbs up!",1379289600,3,692,5.008695652173913

5880068,5,B00DZ7DRI2,This is a new way of exercising with an emphasis on the core in relation to a whole body workout; it starts with posture and goes from there. I definitely recommend.,1392940800,,165,4.354838709677419
5880069,4,B00DZ7DRI2,"This is wonderful, comprehensive collection of strength/movement exercises.  The demonstrations are extremely helpful in executing them with proper technique.  At the end of the dvd the section on setting up a weekly programme seemed to be hurried.  A few sample weekly programmes (to print out) would have been extremely helpful.  This was also missing from the book.",1391299200,15,368,5.4035087719298245

8599434,1,B00DZ7DRI2,"This is not a exercise DVD.  You cannot play this and start exercising.  You have to make up your own routines.  To me, that makes this worthless and a complete waste of money.

He doesn't do a complete count of 12 for one set for any of the exercises demonstrated, even though he recommends at the end to start with 2 sets of 12 reps for each exercise.  And, he never demonstrates doing the other side.  Who would want to pause, do the exercise, and then fast forward to the next???

I have the book already.  If I wanted to make up my own routine and do my own counting, I could have done that and saved myself $20.

I have purchased a lot of exercise DVDs.  They have obviously never seen one to know what a customer expects.",1445126400,13,728,4.172661870503597
