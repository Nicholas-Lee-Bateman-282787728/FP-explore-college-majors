8013830,5,B0001KNHTK,"This is an exceptional movie, one of the great things is it is word for word so you don't get a lot of extra stuff that isn't in the Bible like other movies. With the exception of a few small things like Messiah saying ""I'm telling you the truth"" instead of saying ""truly"" which is emphatic vs. trying to convince them. I also don't know if the disciples would have been wearing the phylactaries (a Jewish Tradition) as implied in one section though possible. Both of those are very small. The movie is well made and doesn't have the made for TV feel of most Bible movies. I highly recommend it!!",1402963200,,596,4.378378378378378
8013831,3,B0001KNHTK,"As a minister of the word of God and a life long student of the bible, I love that the movie is word for word scripture which is why I gave it a 3, but to me, Jesus seems to be played as if He has a chip on his shoulder. Seems rather cold compared to the role in the visual bible Book of Matthew which I feel is a more accurate portrayal of our Lord.",1394668800,,350,3.6184210526315788
8013832,5,B0001KNHTK,"After seeing or hearing about so many films based entirely on the Gospels According to Matthew and Luke, this production is a fairly good change.  The Gospel According to John is the most unique of the four gospels and, therefore, deserves to be reflected on in a visual drama.  Everything comes from the Good News Bible, so you will not hear all the details in their traditional format.  However, none of the details in John's gospel are left out.
  The production does not reflect as well on Christ's passion as ""The Passion of Christ.""  In fact the ""scourging"" and ""crowning with thorns"" are not vividly portrayed although these events are still made important.  Nevertheless, this film nicely portrays the Gospel According to John, which I recognize as the greatest of all Biblical writings.",1078963200,,795,4.932330827067669
