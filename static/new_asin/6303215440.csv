I found it  fascinating to realize that Australians were dealing with the same issues  of social changes and the Vietnam draft that we were!  Wonderful writing,  great insight, super performances!  DO NOT pass this by! Finally, I found  the character of Sr. Agnes to be one of the most interesting - when you  first ""meet"" her, esp for those of us who may have had a teacher  like her, you understand Catherine wishing she were dead!  As the film goes  on, you begin to understand her point of view, her capacity for compassion  and the breadth of her mind - she is a superb theologian!

616674,4,6303215440,"Brides of Christ is one of the most exceptional dramas about ""real life"" in a convent that I have seen yet.  It portrays ""sisters"" as real people who struggle with real issues from the  teachings of the Catholic Church to power struggles and bouts with their  own humaness through love and sadness.  It focuses on two sisters who have  a great love for one another through friendship and circumstance yet who  are seperated soon after their entering so as not to inhibit their  formation.  They are eventually reunited on their journey...
Sr.  Catherine cannot come to grips with the teaching magesterium of the Church  and speaks out against it despite much opposition from within.  She has a  true love for others and wants what is best for them but cannot reconcile  herself to a Church and religion she loves and yet cannot come to terms  with.
Sr. Paul loves the Church and God with all of her heart and seems  to fit right in to convent life with a sense of humor that seems able to  overcome anything.  She is accepting and loving yet finds herself at odds  with the community after falling in love with a ""rebel"" priest.
This movie is set during the Vatican II era where there is much change  and tension within the Catholic Church.  It is done within the settings and  confines of the convent and within a Catholic Boarding School.  The  Catholic students within the movie play a very substantial part in the  lives of the sisters and help to bring an understanding of those tumultuous  teenage years.
Brides of Christ took great strides in trying to bring  reality to the lives of those which remain hidden to most of the world.  The only exception is that it was misleading in promoting a correct view of  how the teachings of the Church come about and how and why they should be  accepted.  One can pick this up if they are a well instructed Catholic but  if one is not they can easily be led astray.  All in all the movie was just  a great movie with real situations and real characters.",925689600,17,2000,4.512605042016807
616793,5,6303215440,I saw this originally on TV and enjoyed it so much I had to have a copy. It was passed around to my friends. They all enjoyed it!,1394928000,,129,3.642857142857143
616794,5,6303215440,"This Australian TV mini-series remains one of the finest I've ever seen -- as rich & complex as any novel, with the lives of many fascinating characters interwoven over the space of several crucial years in Catholicism, the time of Vatican II & the changes it brought. The stories of several nuns parallel & intersect those of several schoolgirls in their care, as the pressing issues of the day are explored with sensitivity & nuance. There are no outright villains, no spotless heroines -- rather, we're offered something rare in popular entertainment these days, the lives of women as three-dimensional human beings, not just sexual objects -- although sexuality is one of the divisive issues they explore.

Some reviewers have mistakenly called the series an attack on religion in general & the Catholic Church in particular. I can't see that. For example, the essentially conservative but compassionate Mother Ambrose is presented as a caring, sympathetic woman, sometimes troubled by the rules she lives by, sometimes helpless to aid those most in need of it, but always striving to to do her best for others without condescension. And while Sister Catherine is in many ways the primary viewpoint character, with her sharp & questioning mind on full display, we also see how she sometimes fails as well. Even the stern Sister Agnes is far more than the tough ""top sergeant"" she initially seems, while Sister Paul is clearly a born teacher with a heart as big as the world -- a heart made for breaking at one point.

And so it is with all the characters, both nuns & schoolgirls. Even for a lapsed Catholic like myself, long since in the agnostic camp, the depiction of faith in all its light & shadows is quite moving. These aren't blind fanatics, but women called by some inner need & desire to fulfill their lives through the spirit. Yet they're often brought up against the constraints & limitations of that path, as well as its possibilities, with each individual dealing with her situation in her own way.

The schoolgirls are equally diverse, coming of age in the mid-1960s, with all the ferment of the times swirling around them. Again, each one is a distinct individual, struggling to cope with the demands of both faith & approaching adulthood, as well as their own awakening sexuality. But it isn't just the physical aspect of sex that's examined, it's the emotional aspect as well. Most of all, the difficulty of becoming one's own person is shown with understanding & empathy, without any easy answers appearing at the last minute.

As I said before, what makes this series especially welcome is its emphasis on women in a world made by & run by men -- but they're never solely defined by men. If anything, they're defined by their relationships with one another, in a world men can't enter & seldom try to understand. Feminist? Yes, in that the women are seen first & foremost as themselves, seeking to become whole human beings -- and that's not only feminist, but just plain human. It's what we're all trying to do, isn't it?

I see that this DVD is currently out of print. That's a shame, because it deserves to be readily available to thoughtful, discerning viewers. My single complaint is that I wish it could have been at least twice as long -- these compelling women remain with you, and I would dearly love to learn more about them. Beautifully written, superbly acted, and most highly recommended!",1390780800,4,3425,4.808149405772496

616802,5,6303215440,"This six-episode Australian miniseries follows a group of nuns and their students through the turbulent changes brought on by Vatican II in the early sixties.  Sensitive Mother Ambrose (Sandy Gore) is in charge of the convent and school, aided by stalwart Sister Agnes (Brenda Fricker).  They welcome into the community two new sisters, gullible Paul (Lisa Hensley) and brave Catherine (Josephine Byrnes) and watch as the young nuns adjust to their new life.  Their students face challenges, too, as shy Frances (Naomi Watts) and rebellious Rosemary ( Kym Wilson) learn about boys (including a young Russell Crowe).

Everyone in the cast is exceptional.  They are so believable and the storylines so compelling that you forget they are acting and really care about them.  I would have happily watched another six episodes, as their lives were so interesting.  Each hour-long episode focuses on the emotional ups and downs of one character and there are a few surprises along the way...struggles with rules, poor choices, and learning that one never stops growing.

616854,5,6303215440,"I saw this mini-series originally on a cable TV channel and then sought it out on VHS (I've had it for a while, obviously).  Even with commercials it was mesmerizing, drawing me into the story immediately.  I think the scene that really grabbed me was when Diane/Catherine was a little girl trying on her mother's wedding dress and jewelry and she sees the figurine of the Virgin come ""alive"" for a moment. The series has excellent writing and acting.  All the characters, even the more peripheral ones, are fully realized.  Some of the actors were familiar to me (Russell Crowe and Naomi Watts - both exuding star quality even as young actors - especially, but also Brenda Fricker), and others I had never seen before, but all were first-rate. The ones that stand out are the actresses who play Catherine and the Reverend Mother of the order.

I'm not Catholic, so some of the issues in the program were new to me and I found them fascinating. It must have been difficult for Catholics in that era to deal with all the changes in the church.

I also thought that the balance between the girls' stories and the nuns' stories was well done.  I loved the ending, where the story is both brought full circle and propelled into the future.

All in all, this series is well worth your time for whatever reason you may choose to watch it.  The whole series will keep your attention throughout.",1247184000,2,1387,4.582995951417004
616855,1,6303215440,"I watched the entire series, which I regretted very much.

In this TV series, the sins of pride, disobedience, and infidelity to the Magisterium seem to be presented as ""independent thinking"" while fidelity to the teaching authority of the Church seems to be portrayed as rigid, conservative, and blind. Meanwhile, I feel that purity of the body is depicted as sexual repression. In my opinion, Church teachings and devotions are shown disrespect in this show - often through the voice of one of the main characters.

This central character, right before entering the convent, has sex with her fiance. It doesn't seem that the wrongness of this fornication is implied in the storytelling (e.g. we don't see the character going to confession afterwards). This college-educated woman is portrayed throughout the series as the seemingly open-minded, compassionate, ""independent-thinking"", ""forward-looking"" member of the community who knows what ""real life"" is about. In an argument, she calls the writings of Church Fathers (e.g. St. Augustine) as ""medieval hocus-pocus."" Not surprisingly, she leaves the convent at the end of the series because she cannot agree with the encyclical ""Humanae Vitae"", which condemns artificial birth control. She advises a member of the faithful to take contraceptive pills and then goes to the confessional declaring that she isn't sorry for it and ""should not be."" Her disobedience, pride, and infidelity to the Church seems to be depicted as ""honesty"" and ""courage"" which enabled her to ""see the light."" Nothing can be further from the truth, and yet she appears to be the designated ""voice of reason"" in this TV series.

I feel the series contains disrespect for the Catholic Church and Catholic devotions in general. A teenage student repeatedly throws stones at the statue of Our Lady of Lourdes, and this is very much emphasized in one particular episode.

Moral teachings of the Church seem to be criticized by the tone of the series. A divorced woman becomes a hero and appears to be a social ""martyr"" due to her ""courage"" to ""remarry"" in order to follow her true ""love."" Two of the nuns even go to the ""wedding"" ceremony to provide emotional support for the daughter of this woman - not thinking that this might be a cause for scandal.

There are several graphic (in my opinion), prolonged impure scenes depicting sinful acts (including teenage sex), which to me are disturbing, very uncomfortable, and unnecessary. I found myself fast-forwarding to escape the disturbing sounds and images, but sometimes they can catch one by surprise. Once those images and sounds get into one's head, for a while they might be difficult to forget and their effects can be quite dangerous and harmful.

None of the central religious characters or clergy in this series acts in a uniformly edifying behavior. A nun dyes her hair to cover her grays (suggested by the Mother Prioress) in order to look good in the new habit. The Mother Prioress finds herself in an inappropriate/intimate situation with a male lay teacher - inappropriate and intimate especially considering her religious vocation. She is also seen looking at herself in a mirror in her swimsuit - again, in a way that doesn't seem befitting to the religious.

It is hard (if possible at all) to find an altogether exemplary religious among the principle characters. In fact, there seems to be very little true spirituality contained in the script. The characters seem to perform religious practices as mere formalities or rituals that people do superficially without fully interiorizing them in their heart and mind. It was my impression that deep piety and religious conviction is not clearly shown (if at all) in any of the main characters - perhaps except possibly Sr. Agnes, who however appears to be a caricature of a mean-spirited ""conservative,"" which is unfortunate. In my opinion, genuine fraternal love in the community was not very successfully painted (there was obvious particular friendship, which is not the same), for the nuns are often seen bickering at each other. The teaching nuns in the series can be rather impatient and unsympathetic - yelling at their students even. Some of the students at least - if I remembered correctly - as a result seem to see their teachers as enemies, who were given an unflattering nickname ""bloody penguins.""

In addition, it was my impression that many of the characters are stereotypes - predictable and lacking in true depth. The script, in my opinion, does not display an authentic understanding of religious life nor of the Catholic religion. Its treatment of these themes seemed distorted to me.

I wouldn't recommend this series. I would also urge Catholics to avoid it especially.",1238803200,15,4729,5.075933075933076
616856,5,6303215440,"Having been a nun during these times, I found the experiences fairly true to life.  The VERY LAST scene was a heartbreaker.  Very well done.",1200700800,4,140,4.56
616857,5,6303215440,"The brilliance of this series, where conflicts within the Roman Catholic religious life are treated through incidents in the lives of Sisters and students, may not be captured by all at first glance. The obvious (and superbly handled) theme is adjusting to drastic changes in monastic and Church life. Yet there is a greater depth still in less glaring themes, which mirrored what many Sisters faced.

The community of Spirito Santo is depicted as quite exceptional, with a high intellectual standard and, even in the days before the 'old ways' are abandoned, a degree of warmth and interaction between most Sisters which is beyond what some communities would have experienced. Various Sisters illustrate shortcomings (which one can see only in hindsight) which had drastic implications for the Church at large, not only the religious life (which too often was in its dying days.) For example, the wise, truly caring Mother Ambrose, who at first seems to wish to involve the viewpoints of all Sisters in community decisions, illustrates a very common response of the time - valuing 'unity' (such as that shown in forcing all Sisters into the modified habit) at all costs. It may not be obvious to those who did not have close associations with religious Orders, but, during the period, far more drastic, sometimes devastating, 'options' than a modified garb became permissible, then an unwritten rule, in the name of the 'ways of the community.'

Diane/Sister Catherine is an interesting, if exasperating, character, because, initially, it is to the congregation's credit that one who questioned constantly, often in a superior, smug, and self absorbed fashion, was not dismissed for a lack of 'obedience.' One would wonder why someone of her sort entered religious life in the first place, though there is a strong hint that she overestimates her own intellectual gifts and thinks herself to be quite a prize. Catherine's overall story points out traps into which many Sisters fell.

For example, much of the conflict surrounding Humanae Vitae (the topic of one episode), which was stirred by celibates, arose from anger that the pope's statement was against the recommendations of his committee - the Religious protested more because of collegiality or a sense of 'democracy', where the married (who did not depart in droves, even if they did not obey the directives) largely were not concerned with such consultations. Catherine's ire is not only directed at Rome, but at married people who don't 'take her side up on' the prohibition on birth control. She is too blinded by her own agenda to see the implicit condescension, nor, for all her academic intelligence, does she have the minimal wordly wisdom which would have prevented her from commenting on, let alone interfering in, anything as private as a couple's marital practise.

Another solid image is how many Sisters, looking to show acceptance and dispel a supposed image of their being inapproachable and rigid (though most Spirito Santo Sisters, from the first frame of the film, are anything but), ignored prudence. It is perfectly understandable when student Frances is sent to attend her mother's registry office wedding - yet neither Sisters Catherine nor Paul can see that their attending, then dancing the twist in long habits at the reception, could make them seem vaguely pathetic (look at the queens of cool...), as well as be taken for a protest against teachings of the Church which they represent. The mothers at the school, who avoid Frances' mother, indeed seem hard and uncharitable, but the dimension that is not presented (and which Sisters well might forget, because their desire to seem tolerant could cause tunnel vision) is that parents may not wish their children to see a fuss over one who, to their minds, departed from the commitment of sacramental marriage.

Sister Paul's story was especially insightful. Non-Catholics, or Catholics who were not that aware of matters theological at the time, can miss that this is not merely a tale of a young woman who suddenly is questioning whether her decision to enter a convent should be permanent. In the aftermath of Gaudium et Spes, a document which presented a far from new idea about the 'universal call to holiness,' too many religious minimised the value of their own lives, seeing the 'only call as baptism.' Sister Paul is a delightful young teacher, who seems perfectly happy in convent life, but who is not only dealing with her first strong attraction to a man (whom she cannot see does not return her love, but is using her to 'get back at' the Church as he departs the priesthood in bitterness) but with the sudden new idea that there is no real value in religious life, sees only that she'd serve God just as well as a wife and mother. Ambrose's comment captures a great deal of a situation which many Sisters of sanguine disposition faced: Paul entered at 19 more because it was 'what everyone expected,' and 'never really made a decision in her life.' Her ultimate decision is to remain a religious, but she did not see that she had not developed maturity until confronted with the conflict.

The single deficiency in the presentation was that Sisters who are of more conservative bent are shown as being so because of defects of character rather than conviction. This was a very common idea in religious life at that time - and indeed a manipulative tactic to push conformity. (For example, Sisters who preferred to retain religious garb were convinced that they must want to keep people at a distance - those who wished common prayer schedules were written off as immature.) Though Sister Agnes is an intelligent, learned woman, she is of a very trying, domineering personality, and it seems implicit that her desire for the 'old ways' is based on her difficulty in dealing with others. I was sorry that there was no episode from her point of view. The other 'conservative' Sister who is any major emphasis is pathetic - an emotional wreck who breaks down before the community, sobbing that she wants to be told what to do and does not want to make her own decisions, and then makes a suicide attempt. One could come away from a series which otherwise is notably frank and realistic with the impression that more conservative Sisters were either dreadful personalities or mentally ill.

Of course, there is an element of pathos in the final product as well. The efforts of the Sisters at the time are understandable - seeking to adapt and have a fresh spirit, and to become more available to those whom they served. As time has shown, the very climate of 'options', supposed democracy and dialogue which cut out voices which did not fit the party line and thought such voices inferior, and the conformity, no less than that of the old ways even if it was called being 'community minded' rather than 'obedience,' sounded the death knoll for the positive religious life one sees in this film.",1187654400,9,6940,4.921434671221179
616858,5,6303215440,I was in religious life and this series honestly reflects the joys and sorrows of religious life and the struggles many of the sisters endured  during the 60's.

The series faced each issue squarely and honestly, neither condemning nor simply excusing each practice.  An excellent program.",1171843200,3,470,5.397260273972603
616861,3,6303215440,"I viewed all of the episodes one day last week when I was sick, and perhaps that dampened the mood of my opinion of the series. I read the other reviews and on most parts agree whole heartedly that the acting is top notch and the script an accurate portrayal of the crises that many monastics experienced in the time leading up to Vatican Two and especially thereafter regarding the meaning and substance of not only their personal vocation, but the value of the faith and Church at large. Brides of Christ also shows the Catholic societal milieu wherein the Church held an authority over the faithful somewhat unknown in our time.

OK, READ NO MORE IF YOU DO NOT WANT THE ENDING SPOILED.

My main qualm with the series centers around the way the writers portrayed the crises of faith for the cast. In general, and I think actually this applies to every case, those who remained faithful to the Church's teaching were portrayed as either nave and simple minded or strict and rigid, unable to live in the ""real world."" I have the suspicion that this was part of the writers' agenda and bias, but who knows. Moreover, those who were portrayed positively in the film were the rebels who disobeyed the Church and were ""with it,"" or simply those who wised up and threw off the habit or the novitiate. This is my only issue in an otherwise very entertaining series that I will watch again sometime (maybe when I am not ill).

One true point that the film made was how the legitimate and progressive interpretation of the spirit of V2 that sought to give personal choice was used by the liberals to, ironically, strictly enforce their own agenda to rid the Church of authority and traditionalism in most forms. It seems to this reviewer that this is one of the tendencies of reform movements is that they lose sight of their spirit and become just as tyrannical and despotic as their supposed oppressors, e.g. communism and most academia. I would argue that in truth the Orthodox and Catholic traditions are actually more tolerant and liberal than the liberals, but that's another story.

I know several nuns and ex-nuns from the era and they also watched it with similar feelings, even though one of them is of the liberal type to begin with and left about 15 years after V2. Yes, going from Latin to ""Kumbaya Lord"" was indeed a huge shift for them all, along with the forced decisions that some of the more ""progressive"" abbesses and bishops shoved down the pipe.",1157241600,10,2458,4.617848970251716

Vatican 2 is enthralling. I am not a religious person but have always had a fasciantion with nuns and the lives they have chosen to lead. Brides of Christ shows different nuns and how they deal with the change, and the obedience required when choosing this life as a vocation.

Mother Ambrose tried her best to change while maintaining her faith, Sister Agnus is againt all changes and wishes for the Church to keep all of it's traditions and rituals, Sister Paul is unsure of what she wants and Sister Catherine hopes for the Church to change at an even faster pace...the last straw for her is when the Pope announces he is against birth control.

616991,5,6303215440,"The Second Vatican Council, a.k.a. Vatican II, began in 1962 when the newly elected Pope John XXII called Catholic bishops around the world to meet and reflect on the place of the Roman Catholic Church in the contemporary world.  The idea was to open the windows of the Church and let in some fresh air.  This meant the decentralization of authority, the introduction of the local language into the church liturgy, and in general a new spirit of ecumenism.  Religious orders were encouraged to make decisions about their daily lives and to examine their rituals and customs for elements that had become irrelevant in the modern world.  However, the traditionally conservative hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Australia did not move quickly to embrace such reforms and it was the nuns who emerged as the leaders in the spiritual and educational revolution Down Under.

""Brides of Christ"" is a six-part 1991 mini-series set in the convent of Santo Spirito in Sydney during the turbulent 1960s.  The convent is also a boarding school for young girls.  Each chapter is named for one of the characters and while I though that this would be the story of six different nuns, some of the episodes focus more on the young girls at the school.  In retrospect ""Brides of Christ"" focus on three generational pairs.  Mother Ambrose (Sandy Gore) heads the convent with her stern right hand, Sister Agnes (Brenda Fricker).  Joining the convent and becoming the best of friends are Diane (Josephine Byrnes) and Veronica (Lisa Hensley), who become Sister Catherine and Sister Paul respectively.  Amongst the girls the two who stand out are Frances Heffernan (Naomi Watts) and Rosemary Fitzgerald (Kym Wilson), although Mary Maloney (Pat Bishop) becomes a pivotal character at the end as well.

Episode 1, ""Diane,"" introduces the key character in the series.  Diane is about to get married and has even slept with her fianc when she decides to call off the wedding and enter the convent instead.  As Sister Catherine goal is to control her ego, but this is going to prove to be a major problem.  Although such special friendships are frowned upon by the domineering Sister Agnes, Sister Catherine becomes close to Sister Paul, another new postulate.  But the bigger problem is that Sister Catherine wants to argue with not only Sister Agnes about Catholic theology, but to challenge the teachings of Anselm and Aquinas as well.  However, the reforms of Vatican II make her radical thoughts more acceptable than ever in the Church's history.

Episode 2, ""Frances,"" finds Sisters Catherine and Paul are now both teaching at the convent and focuses on the friendship that has formed between young Frances and Rosemary.  Frances's father and mother are separated, and when her mother wants to get remarried, Frances worries that her mother will go to Hell for getting a divorce.

Episode 3, ""Ambrose,"" is about changes at Santo Spirito presided over by the Reverend Mother.  The two most important ones are a new lay teacher, Ian McGregor (Philip Quast), who teaches economics, and the adoption of a new habit by the sisters.  Not only Sister Agnes, but also Sister Philomena (Caroline Gilmer) do not want to accept change and McGregor proves to be too radical for the parents of the girls.

Episode 4, ""Rosemary,"" finds Sister Agnes's lessons on self respect lost on young Rosemary.  After one of the girls is expelled from the boarding school for having sex, Rosemary becomes promiscuous.  She also has a crush on Mary Maloney's sister, Dominic (Russell Crowe), whose number comes up for Vietnam.

Episode 5, ""Paul,"" finds Sister Paul developing feelings for her old friend, Jack (Simon Burke), a radical priest who leaves the church because it is not changing quickly enough.  Sister Paul decides to leave the convent, but maintains her vow of chastity while she tries to figure out what she really wants to do with her life.

Episode 6, ""Catherine,"" brings us back full circle, as it is now Sister Catherine who questions staying in the convent after the Pope's new encyclical on birth control is released.  Mother Ambrose is in Rome and Sister Agnes is running Santo Spirito, which does not make things any easier.  Young Frances has strong feelings about the subjects of birth control and abortion as well, which brings her into conflict with her friend Mary, who announces her desire to become one of the penguins.

I am reminded somewhat of ""The Trouble With Angels"" by ""Brides of Christ,"" not so much in terms of the convent/boarding school setting but more because of the careful balance between respect for the sisters and the intimate portrait of their lives.  The key thing here is that the characters are all fully realized, and even the minor characters have specific functions to fulfill in life at the convent.  I was inclined not to like the resolution of the conflict because of the point it is making, but if Sister Agnes is okay with it then I have little room to complain.  Overall, I liked the story lines focusing on the Sister Catherine and Sister Paul (the fact that Byrnes and Hensley are good friends off screen helps) and even on the Old Guard nuns more than I did those about the youngsters, but I understand how things have to be marketed on television, even on the other half of the world.

Obviously Catholics and those raised in the Church who remember those times will find these stories resonating more than those of different faiths.  But these stories really are more about the characters than the issues. Although ""Brides of Christ"" is set in the 1960s most of the issues remain relevant and represent inherent tensions between the Church and those living in more liberal democratic nations, The mini-series is quite captivating.  The sparse extras on the two-DVD set are all screen shots, but they do note that Watts and Crowe have gone on to somewhat successful screen careers.",1122854400,16,5899,4.898390342052314

The Brides of Christ provides the novice with an insider's view of the turmoil that hit the Catholic church after Vatican II. I love Australia and Australians and one of the high points of the Brides of Christ is it takes place in Australia from 1963-1973. The entire cast is nothing but talent, Brenda Fricker is superbly cast as the ulitmate authority figure / conservitive while Josephine Byrnes ,is perfect for the role as the rebel nun. This mini-series have been criticized often as being too critical of the Roman Catholic Church's leadership and in many ways it is,  but all in all this is an outstanding production This Mini series is a must for your video collection.",1041724800,8,844,4.516339869281046
616994,5,6303215440,"Like so many others, I first saw ""Brides of Christ"" on A&E in the early 90's. I would have to say that in terms of quality, it compares with ""The Sopranos."" There is never a false note, and it runs the gamut from the most enjoyable comedy to the most heartrending tragedy.
  It was the first time I saw Naomi Watts, and I fell in love with her instantly. Her talent was very evident even then, and it is a real shame that it has taken so long for her to become well known.  I looked for her after this series but was frustrated that she seemed to have ""disappeared.""  Fortunately she is now experiencing considerable success, and it is much deserved.  I went to ""The Ring"" on the day it opened, and I went solely because of Naomi. I was not disappointed!  It was also gratifying to see her do well in ""Mulholland Drive.""
  I certainly hope Naomi garners the kind of success and respect that has been attained by her good friend, Nicole Kidman.",1035504000,5,943,4.318181818181818

616996,5,6303215440,"These videos are excellent, in terms of story line and content. Ther series cover the lives of the nuns,and pupils of the convent of Santo Sprito in Austrialia. The main ecclesiastical characters, Ambrose(the broadmind Mother Superior) Agnes ( the fundementalist, Mistress of novices')Catherine ( the rebellious one) and Paul( the accepting one) are so believable. The series takes place against the back drop of the swinging sixties and vactican Two, whose reform died with Jonn XXIII. It shows how the nuns react to the changes. Sister Catherine was so credible as the young educated woman trying to conform to the strict tenets of the Catholic faith, and eventually realising she could not. The pupils, Bridget, Frances and Rosemary were all fantastic. This video also highlighted the problems Catholic women had with contraception. Bridget's mother was forced to do a home abortion, because taking the pill was and still is a mortal sin, even if used within marriage. It also showed how divorce was viewed by Catholic society, Frances' mother was ostracised by the other parents, yet the two young sisters Catherine and Paul were given leave by Mother Ambrose to attend the civil wedding. An excellent video, beautifully done.",1016928000,10,1230,5.185929648241206

I own Brides of Christ and have watched it many times.  Highly recommnded for anyone who enjoys a good story whether you are religious or not.",997747200,2,478,4.642857142857143
616998,5,6303215440,"I purchased this set for no more reason that it is Russell Crowe's first acting job.  Mr. Crowe doesn't appear until the 4th of 6 episodes, and then only in that one.  I meant to play through it with the sound off until he appeared on screen.  But within 10 minutes of the first episode's beginning, I found it impossible not to start listening, and watched the entire series in wrapt fascination.
I'm neither Catholic nor Christian, but this program transcends its subject and looks directly into the hearts of its characters with a rare simplicity that avoids sentimentality while being infinitely touching.  Brenda Fricker is lovely and moving, and holds centerstage without taking away one iota from the large supporting cast of mostly female players, young and old.
This unusual series comes highly recommended as a look into a world I'd never even considered, yet one that is varied, fascinating, and wholely worthwhile.
Oh!  And Russell Crowe is BRILLIANT!  Young, charismatic, charming, and just the right amount of awkward.  From the start he had a nose for good material, and this show proves it.",995500800,21,1106,4.945945945945946

They weren't completely  successful, or maybe those who were ""dissenting"" simply came  across louder.  And in a more obnoxious way.  Sister Ambrose came across as  one who tried to tread as best she could through confusing times, and do  the best she could without losing what was important.  Sister Catherine  annoyed me from the very beginning.  She spent almost the entire time  disagreeing with everything that was being taught, and presenting her ideas  as if they were so perfectly correct that there was no way that anyone who  had an opposing view might be right.  Her arguments didn't impress me.  The  incident about the nun with the purple came across as so incredibly sad.  Now THAT made me cry.",967161600,11,899,4.624203821656051

So I have been on a search to find it. Even though iy was expensive, it was worth the price.
  The women who answer the call to a vocation to become ""brides of Christ"" come from different
backgrounds and personalities. Seeing them become novices and growing into professed nuns
gives us a window into who they are and become.
  Delightful, educational and at times sad, the journey of these
""brides of Christ"" will take you along their spiritual lives & their personal
ones also.
  I hated for this series to end.
This is something a family can watch together, even if they are not Catholic.
It reflects the times of the 1960's for those of us who remember.",1504051200,,719,4.534883720930233
7842598,5,6303215440,"First saw this miniseries on A&E in the early 1990s and taped it on VCR cassette, and kept those tapes and occasionally still watched them (it's that good a story), until finding it on DVD here. Was delighted to find ""extra scenes"" that were cut out of what A&E had broadcast. They filled-in some gaps. (When I say extra scenes, I don't mean DVD Extras, more like ""Director's Cut"" version of the series.)

I've always viewed this as one of the most ""fair"" portrayals (meaning not blatantly anti-Catholic/Modernist) of the Roman Catholic Church. Nearly 25 years later I still catch nuances I'd never noticed before, such as the obedience flip-flop (Catherine can suddenly obey, while Agnes suddenly cannot). Outstanding scenery, costumes, believable story and characters, and the actors and actresses (fun to see young Russell Crowe and Naomi Watts) knocked it out of the park. Everything clicks. Few movies, much less miniseries, pull that off and still hold-up 25 years later.",1468195200,2,977,5.068322981366459

I also saw nothing wrong with the two nuns being friends. The nun who left the convent to marry her long time friend, well I thought he was very self centered and shallow. I always thought of nuns as kind, gentle and loving, but most of these nuns seemed the opposite as to being cruel, hard hearted, etc.

7842605,4,6303215440,"Brides of Christ was an Australian TV miniseries that takes place behind the walls of a Sydney convent school and deals with the struggles of both the Roman Catholic nuns and the young students to adapt to the many social changes taking place within the church and the outside world during the 1960's.

Inside the convent walls of Santo Spirito, six remarkable women find themselves caught between old tradition and the radical social changes reshaping the secular world. The miniseries consists of astonishing stories, both in the rich personal lives of the nuns and the cultural shifts at work as the Catholic Church struggled to bring itself into the modern age. Over six hour-long episodes, Brides of Christ focuses on six women: Sister Ambrose,played by Sandy Gore, the Mother Superior of Santo Spirito, whose gentle leadership goes astray when the school hires a male teacher; Sister Agnes,portrayed by Brenda Fricker, a conservative nun who resists the modernizing changes dictated by the Vatican; Sister Paul,played by Lisa Hensley, an uncomplicated but devoted young nun who leaves the sisterhood when she falls in love; Frances,portrayed by Naomi Watts, a student whose parents are undergoing divorce; Rosemary,played by Kym Wilson, a rebellious girl who fights against the sexual repression of the church; and woven through it all, Sister Catherine,portrayed by Josephine Byrnes,an independent-thinking nun whose craving for reform puts her at odds with her superiors.

This balances respect and empathy with a critical social perspective that is always channeled through these superbly realized women. The smart and deeply felt scripts are given dynamic life by uniformly beautiful performances. Also,it provides an eye-opener on how women are conflicted by old Catholic traditions and the ever-changing secular word. An absolutely fantastic miniseries despite the slow pacing in it.",1417910400,,1895,5.464163822525597
