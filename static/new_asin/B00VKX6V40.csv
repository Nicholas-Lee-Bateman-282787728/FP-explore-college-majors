7093324,5,B00VKX6V40,"HARRY is a psycho-thriller of a drug crime drama on top of a cop's family psychological post-trauma and grief conflict. It is set in the Auckland, but not all is beautiful scenic panorama, but much in the lesser areas where crime prevails. You get plenty of drama along with action. It is a finely tweaked multi-plot investigative thriller with punch. It is also inspired by TRUE events. Harry plays out as a character like good cop-weak cop, and DS Harry is both.
My wife struggled a bit with Harry and the brutality of disregard for life. I had a bit of unacceptability with Harry's baffling persistent expression, but with dialogue he was great. Oscar Kightley plays the Samoan cop, but he was also one of the co-writers. He leads the investigation, but his boss is DSS `Stocks' (Sam Neill -`Merlin' `Tudors' `Dovekeepers'). There are 16 more characters that appear in all or 5 episodes of this 6-part story. All are well played, making viewers either hate or care for them as people. It's intense, It's emotional, It's HARRY!

7093325,4,B00VKX6V40,"Detective Sergeant Harry Anglesea had a 4-week leave following the death of his wife. It's his first day back at the Major Crimes Unit in Manukau, South Auckland. This is an urban area, fraught with drugs and violence. On his first day back he has a new case - a bank robbery that resulted in the death of teller. It's apparently the 4th robbery by the same gang, and the pressure from the top brass to find these guys is intense.

The six episodes of ""Harry"" cover one case, finding these killers. It also covers a part of Harry's personal life that affects his policing. He has a 13 year-old daughter, Mele, who stayed with his Mom while he went to Samoa on grievance leave:
Mele: ""You said you'd only be gone a week.""
Harry: ""I'm sorry.""
Mele: ""I thought you'd never come back.""
Harry: ""Hey, I wouldn't do that to you.""

But the trouble is he did leave her when she needed him most. And he still hasn't ""come back"" because he has not yet really dealt with his wife's death.

This amazon page and the DVD case both tell you that Harry's wife committed suicide. That's too bad, because the way this series lays it out, you know his wife is dead right away, but you only find out gradually that it was suicide. I didn't know it was suicide when I watched the show, and not knowing that at the beginning makes the story stronger - it makes Harry's inability to grieve and Mele's acting out to be puzzles to be solved, too. For example, in the 1st episode, when Harry's boss tells him he's sorry about his wife's death, Harry shrugs his shoulder and says, ""Her choice."" His boss is taken aback, and it's not until you find out that she committed suicide that you realize the depth of Harry's denial.

The DVD case has this warning: ""Contains graphic violence, strong language, drug use, nudity, and sexual situations."" That about covers it. This is an adult show. ""Harry"" felt very much like the first season of ""The Wire"" to me. Very few comic moments - this is gritty urban ""realism"". The difference, compared to ""The Wire"", is that ""Harry"" also spends more time on the personal life of Detective Anglesea.

""Harry"" originally aired in New Zealand in 2013. The 6 episodes total 271 minutes. The DVD/BluRay releases are presented in 16:9 widescreen and stereo. There is only one Bonus Feature on the disc sets, a Photo Gallery that lasts about  2 minutes.

English subtitles are available.  The subtitles do not translate the Samoan occasionally spoken by Harry and his family, but it isn't a problem because you can tell the gist of the conversations from how the people are acting.

Though I think ""Harry"" is a good cop drama, the murder investigation part of it is of average plotting. In any case, my feelings for the series mirror my feelings for ""The Wire"": good show but not one I'd be inclined to watch a second time. My preference is for more standard mystery series (rather than straight cop drama). Another New Zealand series, ""Brokenwood"", has episodic mysteries without the violence of ""Harry"" - five stars!

If you like your police dramas salty, you will find ""Harry"" a good watch.

8710474,4,B00VKX6V40,"Anyone wanting to visit New Zealand after viewing the LORD OF THE RINGS films may be in for a shock.  The rolling, lush scenery one might expect from the land of kiwis is decidedly less appealing if one is to go by what is on display in HARRY, a 6 episode police thriller co-starring Sam Neill, the only big name in the cast.

HARRY, co-written and starring relative new-comer Oscar Kightley, pulls no punches in its depiction of criminals and the less than admirable people who try to bring them to justice.  One might even say there are times when HARRY seems to layer on the violence and profanity with a trowel.

Fortunately, for all HARRY's seediness and unrelenting exploration of the worst in people, there is also a smattering of light in the darkness, even hope, though redemption might be pushing it.

Sensitive viewers will come away from watching HARRY (if they get through all of it) feeling like they need a shower.  I have to admit I found myself in places going ""all right, already.""  Fortunately the creative team realized that with all the bad they were showing there had to be some good.  Subtle though it may be, there are moments in HARRY that help you remember that not everything is hopelessness and despair.  I'm referring to a couple of supporting characters, such as Harry's mother, who is clearly shown to be a Christian.  Along with the parents of a young offender who is not given adequate protection by the police when in prison, these characters remind us there is more to human nature than just violence and revenge.  Without their tempering effect, this viewer would have found HARRY unbearable.

Among all the performances there is a wide range of ability on hand.  Oscar Kightley, who plays Harry, is not the best actor going.  He sometimes comes across as forced or worse, one-note, as he plays scenes of strong emotion.

Sam Neill, usually an outstanding actor, looks like he is slumming.  By far the best performance is that of one of the worst bad guys.  Errol Shand, an actor I'd never heard of before, is absolutely riveting as Chocka Fahey (even the name sounds evil).  His performance elevates HARRY into a program that is highly watchable for one reason only: you want to see what happens to Chocka.  Shand should attract a lot of attention one of these days.  He's a well-known character actor in New Zealand but deserves to be more widely seen.

HARRY is very well done and deserves high marks for look, feel, style and execution.  Shand's performance makes it a must-see, providing you are not completely repulsed by the grim content.

The fact that HARRY is based on a true story may justify, to some, its content and presentation.  For me, I have to ask myself at what point, when watching shows that assault one's senses, does a program cease to be entertaining?  As audiences become more and more desensitized by exposure to extremes of content this may become a moot point, but to me it's worth asking.

All I know is I cared more about what happened to Chocka than I did about Harry.  And I'm not sure it's supposed to be that way!",1443484800,,3084,4.642066420664206
